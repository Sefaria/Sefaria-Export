When the time of payment arrived, A asked for an extension of time and said: \"Take formal possession so that the pledge henceforth be yours if I do not repay you before that date\". A made no payment on the date due after the extension; B, therefore, claims that the pledge became forfeited. A denies having said, \"Take formal possession.……henceforth\".<br><i>A</i>. Usually a statement, such as A is alleged to have made, is classified as <i>Asmakhta</i> and is not binding. But since B is in possession of the pledged articles, and since B has done a favor to A in lending him money, this satement is no longer classified as <i>Asmakhta</i> and is binding. Therefore, if B takes an oath that A made the statement: \"Take formal possession..…henceforth\", the pledge belongs to B.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 1; Pr. 91; L. 333; Rashba I, 1103; <i>Tashbetz</i>, 490; cf.

Is A permitted to deduct from B's wages for the period of the son's illness?<br><i>A</i>. The law provides that when a tutor is prevented from carrying on his duties by his own illness, he is entitled to his pay; but if he is so prevented by the pupil's illness, he is not entitled to his pay, unless the pupil is a sickly child.

B said to A that since he, B, was unlearned and did not know whether or not A had sufficient knowledge to tutor his son, A must go to his (B's) relative C to be examined before entering upon his duties. A came to B's house and began to tutor B's son. Subsequently B discovered that A had never been examined by C. He, therefore, summoned A to court. A now declares himself ready to be examined, but B argues that A's present knowledge is no proof of his previous fitness for his position. Moreover, one witness testifies that at the time A undertook to teach B's son, he was not qualified to do so because of insufficient knowledge.<br><i>A</i>. If A has now sufficient knowledge to teach B's son, the burden of proof lies on B that A did not have such knowledge at the time he was engaged. However, since B has one witness to support his claim, A must take an oath to the effect that he had sufficient knowledge at the time of the agreement.

                "<i>Q</i>. Complying with A's request, the ruler of town T gave A the authority to admit as settlers only those persons of whom A would approve. A claims that B asked him for permission to remain in T for one year telling him that he had settling rights in another place, thus admitting that he possessed no settling-rights in T. B claims that he does possess such rights in T, that his father lived there before him, and denies having asked B for permission to stay there. Should both, B and A, be permitted to stay in T, it might lead to grave consequences, even to the spilling of blood, since B's conduct is known to be corrupt. Rabbi Moses asked what course he should take with respect to their claims.<br><i>A</i>. If A produces witnesses to the effect that B asked permission to remain in T for a year, B will have to leave the town, since by his asking for permission he admitted that he either possessed no settling rights there, or had foregone any rights he might have had. If A can produce no such witnesses, B has a right to dwell in T. However, because of B's wicked conduct, you, Rabbi Moses, should deprive B of his settling rights in T and require A to pay adequate compensation to B. I have often seen communities deprive one of their members of his settling-rights because of misconduct; your court that has the right to confiscate a person's money, surely has the right to deprive one of his settling-rights. You should force, therefore, A and B to leave the case completely in your hands to be decided either by arbitration or according to strictly legal requirements, and then you will be able to decide as you see fit.<br>R. Meir adds:<br>Your opinion that B lost his settling-rights because of the legal principle \"the law of the land prevails\" is untenable. The ruler of T gave A the authority to pass on new settlers, but he gave A no authority to dislodge old residents. Had the ruler of T granted A the authority even to dislodge old residents, the validity of such a grant would depend on the reasons that prompted the ruler to grant such authority. If A asked the ruler for such authority, then A has no right to exercise his authority since by his request he directly injured B's interests. But, if the ruler of T, on his own accord, said that he does not want any Jew to live in T unless he receive A's permission, then A may dislodge B because of the legal principle: \"The law of the land prevails\".<br>The decision of R. Isaac (b. Samuel, the Tosafist) in the case of the Jews who fled from their town and whose real estate the ruler of the town confiscated and, then, sold to other Jews, has nothing to do with our decision. In this latter case, R. Isaac rightly decided that the purchasers must return the property to the original owners (as compensation, the purchasers were entitled to the amount the original owners would have spent to regain their property) for the ruler had no right to confiscate real property that belonged to the Jews for generations. Such an act on the part of the ruler is not considered \"law of the land\" but is rather outright robbery, and, therefore, illegal. In our case, however, the ruler of T is the owner of T and has a right to admit anyone into his town, and to keep out of it anybody he wants to keep out. We cannot claim for B's benefit that his father bought permanent settling rights from the ruler of T and stipulated that he or his descendants could never be dislodged from T, for such transactions were very rare, even though such a stipulation if made would be binding and would render the act of the ruler dislodging B an illegal act.<br>The decision arrived at in the Talmud (B.B. 54b) accepting as binding the Persian law that if the owner of a field defaults in the taxes for that field, anyone who pays the taxes becomes owner of the field, also, has nothing to do with our case; for taxes on real property accumulate even when the owners are away, while Jews are not required to pay taxes to their overlord, unless they actually live in the domain of these overlords. For Jews are not subjugated to their overlords as the Gentiles are, in the sense that they have to pay taxes to a particular overlord even when they do not live in his domain. The status of the Jew, in this land, is that of a free land owner who lost his land but did not lose his personal liberty. This definition of the status of the Jews is followed by the government in its customary relations with the Jews.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 6; Pr. 101, 1001; L. 313; Mord. B.

                "<i>Q</i>. B, C and D with the help of D's father, A, lent money to a Gentile on a pledge that was worth less than the amount of the loan. The Gentile, therefore, put up Gentile sureties for the entire loan. A, originally, agreed to negotiate with the Gentile on condition that he (A) be free from any responsibility should B, C and D sustain a loss through his intervention even though it be as a result of his wilful neglect. Subsequently, A wrote to B and C to return the pledge, and the latter did so. Meanwhile, one of the sureties showed A and D a letter signed by B and C instructing them to release the sureties. Thereupon, they released the sureties. B and C claim that the letter was forged and demand their money from D.<br><i>A</i>. D had no right to release the sureties until he was absolutely certain of B's and C's instructions. He was not to rely on a letter nor on any signature. Although the sureties were still legally responsible for the payment of the debt until released by B and C, D's release afforded the Gentiles an excuse to evade payment. Since A cannot be held responsible, D must make good B's and C's losses, the amount of which is to be evaluated by the court (not the face value of the loan since it was a bad debt and not worth its face value). If, however, B and C returned the pledge to the Gentile after the release of the sureties by D, though they had no knowledge of such release, the loss of the pledge is to be borne by them <i>pro rata</i>. Any additional loss, over and above the pledge, is to be borne by D alone.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 7; Pr. 93; L. 314; Tesh. Maim. to <i>Nezikin</i>, 12."

The fact that there is no actual loss of money to B does not, of itself, absolve A from taking an oath. A is not required to take the oath for another reason.

Undisturbed possession is no proof of rightful ownership unless it be accompanied by a claim of rightful acquisition. Since A does not claim to have bought, or to have received as a gift, settling-rights from B, his undisturbed possession thereof is of no consequence. Moreover, if witnesses testify that A had originally settled in T by resort to violence, even a claim, by A, of rightful acquisition would be of no avail, for a person known to be a robber cannot claim undisturbed possession as proof of rightful acquisition.<br>This Responsum is addressed to R.

B, his neighbor, wants to build a wall alongside A's wall and extend it, as far as he is permitted, up to A's window. But, what is considered the window proper? Is it the narrow, inside, opening or the wide, outside, opening?

Therefore, we want your opinion.<br>Signed: Eliezer b. Shlumiel, Mordecai b. Joseph, Simon Solomon b. Baruch.<br><i>A</i>. The narrow part of the window is the window proper, for two reasons. First, anything a person can build in his house without his neighbor being able to object to it, can not be used as a restriction on such neighbor when he wants to build on his own property. Secondly, a person may increase his lights by beveling the outside border of his window as long as he does not touch the inside border of the window (or vice versa) without his neighbor being able to object to it. Surely one may make his wall very thin without his neighbor being able to object to it; the thinning of the wall has the same effect on the visibility of the window as the bevelling of the border of the window. If one is permissible, so is the other. The neighbor, then, cannot be restrained from placing his wall exactly in the same position he could have placed it before the person widened the outside of his window.

He demanded, therefore, that B pay his share of this payment. B stating that the \"treasurers\" depended on him for the repayment of his obligation, denied A's claim and said that A did not go surety for him and was, therefore, not required to pay B's obligation. B further claimed that the above-mentioned money was actually lost because A put it in the custody of his young children.

However, if at any time B had shown satisfaction with C's being admitted to the partnership, A's oath is unnecessary. h) Since A did not allow B to sell the coin [matrix] for six pounds hoping to sell it later for more, he can not be held responsible merely because his expectations were not realized. j) Since the money belongs to the partnership, B can sue C and the \"officers\" directly because of the \"lien of R. Nathan\" (garnishment).

If the partners, however, have not as yet divided the partnership money among themselves, B may exact an oath from A's children (but not from his wife until she be widowed or divorced) to the effect that they have not misappropriated any of the partnership money. He may exact this oath because of \"the lien of R. Nathan.\" Regarding A's claim to have paid B's obligations to the \"treasurers\", B is free from obligation for that sum; for a person who repays the debt of another has no claim on the latter.

                "<i>Q</i>. A and B formed a partnership for the purpose of buying (and selling) silver, and minting coins. Subsequently A admitted C into the partnership. The affairs of the partners became highly complicated giving rise to litigation, each partner pressing various claims and counterclaims against the other. a) B who lent some of the partnership money on interest, and refused to share the profit on this investment with A, claimed that when he formed the partnership he agreed to share the profit arising out of his buying silver and minting coins, but not out of his money-lending transactions, b) A claimed that he had lent forty pounds to B out of the partnership money, and that B did not repay that debt; B averred that he did repay the forty pounds. c) A claimed that B owed fifteen <i>marks</i> to the partnership, and that the profits that flowed in from Enns, from Neustadt, and from the minters, were included in the fifteen <i>marks</i>. B denied this claim of A. d) A had sent a messenger to Enns to collect ten pounds. The messenger had collected the money but subsequently had lost it. B claimed that A was responsible for this loss since he had appointed the messenger without consulting him. A averred that he had consulted B about it. e) Sixty-one <i>marks</i> were found to be missing from the partnership money. B claimed that the money had been lost while in A's possession, and that the latter was responsible for the loss since he had put the partnership money in the custody of his children who were minors.<br><i>A</i>. a) Since B lent money belonging to the partnership on interest, he must share the profit from these investments with the other partners, even though the partnership was originally formed for other purposes than lending money on interest, unless B had expressly stipulated the condition, at the time the partnership was formed, that he would retain all profits he might earn from money lending; for an agent who employs his principal's money in his own business transactions must share his profits with the principal even though he is fully held responsible for all losses. b) and c) Regarding the other claims and counterclaims of the partners, each partner must take an oath to support his claims and be free from obligation to the partnership. d) A is not responsible for the loss caused by his messenger, since he gave nothing to the messenger, but merely spoke to him. But, if A did give money to the messenger, he must take an oath to support his claim (that he consulted B about appointing the messenger) or to the effect that his partners allowed him a free hand in the management of their affairs, and be free from obligation; otherwise he is to be held responsible for appointing an unreliable messenger. e) If B is positive in his claim that the sixty-one <i>marks</i> were lost while the partnership money was in A's possession, A will have to take an oath denying that the money was lost at that time, or be held responsible for that loss; for putting money in the custody of young children is considered wilful neglect; and a partner, being in the category of a gratuitous bailee, is responsible for wilful neglect. A is to be held responsible for the loss of the ten pounds through his messenger and the loss of the sixty-one <i>marks</i>, only if such losses had occurred before B joined A \"in his work\"; otherwise A can not be held responsible even for wilful neglect, since a bailee is not responsible for losses caused by wilful neglect, if such losses occurred while the owner was with him \"in his work.\"<br>The matter was again sent to R. Meir for his opinion on other problems that arose. f) Regarding the forty pounds lent to B and demanded by A, which B claimed to have repaid, you wrote that both, A and B, were required to take an oath to support their claims. Will A, upon taking such oath, be entitled to collect the forty pounds from B? g) B claimed that A had admitted C into the partnership without his permission. If not for this act of A, he, B, would have earned thirty pounds. A denied B's claim. h) B claimed that towards the end [of their business venture] they had been offered six pounds for the coin [probably the coin-matrix], but that A did not permit him to sell it for that price, while refusing to buy it himself, and thus they lost the six pounds. i) B claimed that C and the \"officers\" [probably the officers of the mint] owed money to the partnership, but that A refused to collect this money. j) A claimed that the sixty-one <i>marks</i> allegedly missing from the partnership money, really represented the payment he had made to the \"treasurers\" in order to free his partners from their obligations to them. He demanded, therefore, that B pay his share of this payment. B stating that the \"treasurers\" depended on him for the repayment of his obligation, denied A's claim and said that A did not go surety for him and was, therefore, not required to pay B's obligation.

It is true that in the Mishnah (<i>Hallah</i> 2,4.) R. Eliezer decides that cakes taken from different pieces of dough may be joined for the purpose of taking <i>Hallah</i> by putting them in one basket. But this law of R. Eliezer is only a restrictive measure in order to require the taking of <i>Hallah</i> from small pieces of dough (by putting them together in a basket), which are, by themselves, too small to necessitate the taking of <i>Hallah</i> from them. But R. Eliezer never meant his law to be a palliative measure.

When L proved a very inefficient, careless, and wasteful trustee, A's sons reached an agreement with L, whereby she was to receive forty <i>marks</i> for turning over the estate to A's sons immediately. Before relinquishing her trusteeship, L and her youngest son B (who was eighteen years of age) agreed to allow R's husband to take his wife's share of the estate immediately, without having to wait for L's death. A's two other sons object to this latter agreement.<br><i>A</i>. A's heirs were entitled to take over his estate at any time they wished to do so. The giving of forty <i>marks</i> to L in order that she relinquish her trusteeship, was entirely unnecessary, for A's document, while making the collection of R's share in A's estate dependant on L's death, did not appoint L trustee of said estate. Moreover, had A explicitly appointed L trustee of his estate, the court would have removed her at no expense to the heirs, since she had proven to be inefficient, careless, and wasteful. The second agreement is not binding on A's two sons since L, not being a trustee of the estate, had no legal power to dispose of part of the estate. B, however, was able to forego his own part of R's share, and his act is binding upon such part if R (or her husband) was in possession of her share at the time of the latter agreement.

In Würzburg a well established local custom is followed to permit a woman to collect two hundred <i>marks</i>. This custom, however, is not logical, for the term \"pound\" is thus interpreted to mean a pound by weight (16 ounces) which is equivalent to two <i>marks</i>.

Thus, I once saw my teacher and relative Rabbi Judah haKohen order the insertion of such phrase in the <i>ketubah</i> of one of his relatives. Since, however, we unqualifiedly write \"one hundred pounds\", we probably mean the coin \"pound\" and refer to the largest money unit current in the particular town. Rabbi Simha established the custom of paying the widow or divorcee one hundred <i>marks</i> as her <i>ketubah</i>, thus interpreting the above mentioned phrase to mean one hundred pounds of heavy coins (<span>ליבריינ\"ש</span>), one pound of which is equivalent to a <i>mark</i>. Indeed, I have heard that in Worms only one hundred pounds <i>Heller</i> are paid; this custom of paying pounds current in the particular town seems to me preferable to all other customs.

                "<i>A</i>. Even if proper forewarning were required before a transgressing woman loses her right to the <i>ketubah</i>, one such warning would be sufficient. Otherwise a woman would be able, without any restraint, continually to cause her husband to sin. For, when forewarned by witnesses, she would temporarily abstain from sin, and, later, return to her mischief. Moreover, any situation that would require the administration of testing-water to a <i>Sotah</i> (a woman suspected of faithlessness), would cause her to lose the right to her <i>ketubah;</i> and the forewarning of a jealous husband, even though preceding by many days the seclusion of his wife with another man, would require the administration of testing-water, as evidenced by the statement of the Baraita (Yeb. 58b): the jealous forewarning of a betrothed would require the administration of testing-water after she married [if she secluded herself with that other man after the marriage took place]. Therefore, a forewarning does not necessarily have to precede a transgression immediately.<br>The question was again sent to R. Meir: A's wife brought witnesses who testified before us that A also had transgressed the ban. We decided, therefore, that she did not lose the right to her <i>ketubah</i>, since she did not intend to commit a sin. Moreover, a woman must be forewarned immediately before committing a sin in order to be classified as a transgressing woman. The Baraita cited above offers no proof to the contrary since it deals with a case where the sinful seclusion immediately followed the jealous forewarning (i. e. the seclusion took place before the marriage).<br><i>A</i>. I still believe that a forewarning does not necessarily have to precede the transgression immediately. Thus Rashi offers two interpretations of the aforementioned Baraita. The first, and most important, interpretation assumes that the seclusion took place after the marriage, and, thus, long after the jealous forewarning. Moreover, the Talmud (Sotah 26a) clearly states that a woman who was jealously forewarned before her marriage and secluded herself with another man after the marriage, must either drink the testing-water or lose the right to her <i>ketubah</i>. However, since A too has transgressed the ban, we must make two distinctions. a) If the wife's sin consisted of merely disregarding the ban, while her act was not sinful in itself, A is not permitted to divorce her; for transgressing a ban causes the death of the transgressor's children, and is, therefore, ground for divorce; but, since A himself transgressed the ban, he can have no objection to a similar act on the part of his wife. b) If A's wife, however, transgressed Mosaic law and Jewish custom, A is permitted to divorce her even against her will; he need not seek the consent of the communities, and he is not required to pay her the <i>ketubah</i>.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 185; L. 393; Tesh.

Rabbi Asher refused to come, but Rabbi Zamlan implored him and pleaded with him saying: \"What can I do for my only son who, after my death, will have to go begging from door to door?\" Rabbi Asher then agreed to act as a witness, and Rabbi Zamlan gave away to his son and to other persons, all of his property as an outright gift effective immediately. After his death, L's relatives summoned Rabbi Zamlan's son to the court of Rabbi Perez. The latter recorded the claims of the two parties and sent the claims to Rabbi Meir without giving the names of the litigants and without expressing any opinion on the subject. Rabbi Meir ruled that L was entitled to collect her <i>ketubah</i>, or to draw her sustenance, from the possessions of Rabbi Zamlan which he had given to his son; his reason being that even an outright gift to an heir is considered an inheritance and that the widow's <i>ketubah</i> is a lien upon it.<br>Rabbi Perez took issue with Rabbi Meir quoting Alfasi's decision that the ordinance of Usha — which ruled that a person who divided all of his property among his children may derive his sustenance as well as that of his wife's from such property — was not accepted.<br>Rabbi Meir reproved Rabbi Perez for resorting to Alfasi when the Talmud specifically decided that the ordinance of Usha was not accepted. R. Meir contended, however, that only that part of the ordinance was not accepted which gave the right to the donor, and to his wife while he was alive, to derive their sustenance from the property he had given away; while the rule that the widow may collect her sustenance or her <i>ketubah</i> from such property after the donor's death, was accepted before the ordinance of Usha was promulgated, and has remained in force independently of such ordinance.<br>Meanwhile L's relatives have written to Rabbi Meir asking for his decsion in this matter. R. Meir answered that he usually refrained from sending legal opinions to litigants, or to their relatives, and confined his responses to judges. But, when Rabbi Perez, in his second letter, gave the names of the litigants, R. Meir realized that the letters from L's relatives dealt with the same case. R. Meir recalled that among these letters was found a letter from Rabbi Asher which explained the circumstances of the gift mentioned above. Therefore, R. Meir added (in his second letter to Rabbi Perez) that since according to Rabbi Asher's letter, the donor mentioned the contingency of death when he summoned Rabbi Asher, he therefore made the gift to his son <i>causa mortis</i> (cf.

                "<i>Q</i>. A sold his ground, which bordered on B's property, to C for a sum of money plus C's share in a piece of ground C held in partnership with D in another part of town. After the sale was completed and the title conveyed, B pressed his rights as an abutter. Since Maimonides rules that the law of preemption does not apply to the case where a person exchanges his immovables for the immovables of another, C was advised to persuade A to refuse to accept from B, in payment of A's ground, anything but the particular piece of ground A was to receive from C. Accordingly A claimed that C's piece of ground was very precious to him and that he valued it like the \"estate of Bar Marion\" (B.B. 12b). B, therefore, bought from D his share of the particular ground he held in partnership with C, and offered it to A in lieu of C's share of the same ground. C, however, objected to D's sale claiming that upon the voiding of his transaction with A he would return to his former status as D's partner, and, having the right of preemption on D's share, he would buy such share leaving nothing to A. A and C employed many other tricks and artifices in order to void B's right of preemption.<br><i>A</i>. Since C bought A's ground and gave away his own ground in partial payment thereof, he no longer owns the latter ground. Since a person who buys real property desired by an abutter, merely acts as the agent of such abutter (B.B. 108a), C must deliver to B the ground he bought from A, receiving in exchange the ground B bought from D plus a refund of his money. Were B unable to acquire such ground from D, he would have repaid C with money for the ground C gave to A; the value of such ground would have been determined by experts and not by C. C would not have been able to claim that his ground was very precious to him having for him the value of the \"estate of Bar Marion\", for such claim is valid only when a person is seeking to take away the property of another (in exchange of his own) against the will of the latter who may plead that his property is very precious to him. But in our case C has sold his property to A, and is only entitled to its market price. Moreover, even if the aforementioned sale were not concluded as yet, and an understanding merely existed between A and C that C convey his ground to A on condition that the conveyance of A's ground be without any interference on the part of the abutters, A could not have insisted on exchanging his ground for ground exactly similar to that of C. A could not have attached special importance to C's ground as having the value for him of the \"estate of Bar Marion\", for the reason already stated. Therefore, B would have been able to pay A with other ground, located in the same town, of equal value as that of C. Many persons have the erroneous notion that the preemptive right of an abutter is void whenever an exchange or real property is involved. Were this true, the parties to a sale of immovables would always add a small piece of ground to the purchasing price in order to place the transaction in the category of exchange of real property, thus turning into a hollow mockery the ordinance of the Rabbis who created the law of preemption for humane reasons. Therefore, whenever we suspect that the circumstances of a sale of real property were specially arranged in order to circumvent the law of preemption, we sustain the preemptive right of the abutter.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 193; Am II, 199, 200."

                "Most scholars hold the opinion that a woman whose husband fell into a body of water whose final boundaries are not discernible, and who, though not permitted to remarry, defiantly transgressed against the prohibition of the Rabbis and did remarry, need not be divorced from her second husband. This opinion they base on the talmudic ruling that the law prohibiting the remarriage of a woman whose husband fell into a \"boundless\" body of water, applies only before, but not after, she has remarried. I once saw a prominent personage of our kingdom remarry under such circumstances without any one admonishing her. All our prominent scholars decided that she need not be divorced, once she has remarried. A great French scholar was then staying in our kingdom, and he, too, permitted her to stay married claiming that he had witnessed a similar case in France and that all the great scholars of France ruled that she need not be divorced. I also gave my consent to his decision though I was hesitant. However, I have finally come to the conclusion that such an opinion is untenable. For, were this opinion correct the prohibition of the Rabbis would be rendered senseless, useless, and ridiculous, since no woman would heed such prohibition and would transgress against it rather than stay single all her life. Why, then, would the Rabbis prohibit such remarriage to begin with! Therefore, we must say that the talmudic ruling which does not require the remarried woman to be divorced, refers only to that woman who remarried because she innocently believed that a scholar had permitted her to do so, as in the case of Hassa (Yeb. 121b) and that of R. Shila (Yeb. 121a); but that it does not refer to the woman who defiantly transgressed the prohibition of the Rabbis. This latter interpretation of the pertinent talmudic sources clarifies the words of the Rabbis and renders them logical and tenable. Therefore, a woman who remarried without receiving permission from a scholar must be divorced, or the husband be put under the ban till he divorce her. We must not be concerned lest a relative of the woman permit her to remarry (thus flouting the prohibition of the Rabbis), for the following reasons: a) only a scholar holding the position among scholars that R. Nahman (the scholar who inadvertantly caused the wife of Hassa to remarry) and R. Shila held in their day, is empowered to permit such a woman to remarry; b) a scholar permitting such a woman to remarry would bring upon himself the ban.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 194; Am II, 97; Mord.

                "<i>Q</i>. B bought from a Gentile woman a house bordering on A's property. B agreed that the woman could remain in the house till the month of <i>Heshvan</i> (October). A and C claim that they were negotiating to buy the house before B appeared on the scene; that A has a partnership in the house since the beams of his house project into the wall of the Gentile's house; that the Gentile owed money to A; that B promised them not to buy the house; that the arbitrators reported to A and C, B's statement to the effect that A and C need not be concerned, and could rely on his word as a Jew that he would not buy the house; that the Gentile gave A and C the keys to her house, and that they opened it, measured the size and noted the arrangement of the rooms, the exits, and the entrances, and locked it, before B bought the house. They, therefore, demand that B transfer the house to them. B avers that he never promised A and C not to buy the house; and that he had negotiated to buy the house long before they did. The Gentile woman claims that A inserted his beams into her wall illegally.<br><i>A</i>. A and C cannot force B to transfer the house to them, for the following reasons: a) B denies having promised A and C not to buy the house; b) if B did make such a promise to A and C, and then broke it he might be called <i>Rasha</i> (wicked) or <i>Abaryana</i> (renegade), but we can not force him to transfer the house to A and C; therefore, no useful purpose will be served by imposing an oath on B regarding such promise; c) although locking a house is considered a valid act of possession, and one may gain title to the property of a Gentile by taking possession thereof (Bechorot 13a), this rule applies only when such an act is accompanied by proper intention by both parties. However, before the two parties agree on the terms of the sale no such intention is possible; therefore, A's locking of the Gentile's house was of no consequence; d) the fact that the Gentile owed money to A does not vest in him the priority rights of an abutter, for, only a creditor who has a mortgage on a house, lives therein, and has a lease thereon so that he cannot be made to move before the year is up has the right of an abutter. Moreover, since A's property borders on that of the Gentile, B may assert: \"I have driven away a lion from your neighborhood\", and such assertion annuls the priority rights A could have claimed as an abutter, as a creditor, or as a partner; e) B's statement to the arbitrators constituted neither an oath nor a vow, but a mere assurance. Even if we agree with A, who has construed that statement to mean an oath, B may not be forced to transfer his house to A merely because he disregarded his oath. Thus A is not entitled to indemnity. Indeed, B should be fined for his sinful act (breaking his oath), but we do not have the authority to impose penalties. However, you, my teacher, and your community, if you find that a disgraceful breach of conduct was committed, you may impose a proper fine upon B, the money to go to charity. Finally, half of B's wall, upon which the ends of A's beams are resting, belongs to A; for, the presence of such beams is ample proof that the wall was held in partnership by the two neighbors."

If A claims that half of the wall and half of the ground it rests on belongs to him, we uphold his claim since the fact that his beams rest on the wall corroborates his statement, and no witness or witnesses contradict him. A is not required to take an oath, not even a <i>gilgul shebuah</i> (oath of implication) in support of his claim. If A, however, admits that the Gentile woman had built the entire wall on her grounds, but that he subsequently persuaded her to permit his placing of his beams on her wall, no part of the wall belongs to him; for the Gentile merely permitted him to place his beams on her wall, but she gave him no part of the wall itself.",

He says that a Gentile, a violent man, placed a <i>mark</i> (8 ounces) of gold in pledge with him; and he, in turn, deposited it with A. When A wanted to leave town, B fearing lest the Gentile bring false accusations against him upon failing to produce the pledge, demanded that A return the gold <i>mark</i> to him. A invited B to go to the Gentile, and promised to free B from obligation to the Gentile. The Gentile, however, refused to listen to A and warned B that he (the Gentile) would collect double its value should his gold <i>mark</i> be lost. B, therefore, grabbed A by the clothes and said to the Gentile that his gold <i>mark</i> was in A's possession. The Gentile, then, angered by A's words made extreme threats against A. Nevertheless, A suffered no bodily injury nor any loss of money on account of this incident.<br><i>A</i>. If the agreement was made at the time of the betrothal, it is binding on A.

                "<i>Q</i>. A and his son-in-law B were partners in a house. A leased his half to B for an indefinite period till the latter's death, at a fixed annual rental. Subsequently, A wanted to sell his part, but B objected. The case was brought before R. Meir who sustained B's objection. Now B is seeking to sell his half and also his right to a fixed rental for the other half. A, however, objects to a sale by B of the right to a fixed rental claiming that he had originally leased his half to B for a low rental in order that B and his family live therein and enjoy it themselves, but not for the purpose of selling it to another. Is A's objection valid? Also, please note that A's daughter, B's wife, was dead, but the children she bore to A are living; does the fact that B's wife is dead prejudice B's rights? Moreover, B claims, and witnesses support his claim, that the agreement of lease was reached between A and B after a sharp quarrel which followed their buying of the property. Thus the lease was not a gift of love [in which case the purpose of the gift must be taken into consideration], but was rather the outcome of litigation and compromise and was, therefore, of the nature of a sale. B further states that should A's objection be sustained in court, he would sell his own half of the house and would dwell in the other half, or would rent out the latter half and would use the rent for his sustenance. Please further inform me, on the other side of this sheet, as to what was done in the case of the widow from Spiers and her two Levite levirs. Signed: Asher b. Rabbi Yehiel.<br><i>A</i>. We are not to take into consideration A's purpose in leasing his half of the house to B, for various reasons. a) When B sells his right to a fixed rental to a third party, he benefits from such sale as much as he would have benefited from living in the house himself. b) Since B has lived in the rented half of the house for a long time, the transaction of the lease is by now complete so that A's original purpose in leasing it is no longer of any consequence. c) A transaction of sale, lease, or even gift, is concluded by two parties, being the result of a meeting of both minds and, therefore, such transaction is not conditioned by the special purpose or intent of one party when such purpose or intent was not in the mind of the other party. Therefore, even if B had no surviving children from A's daughter, the validity of the lease would not have been affected. d) According to your letter, the lease was not motivated by feelings of kindliness, but was a purely business transaction.

Meir adds: Regarding the widow mentioned above, I shall order that my Responsum pertaining thereto be copied for your benefit.<br>The answer bears the superscription: \"To my teacher Rabbi Asher.\"<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 315; Am II, 174.

                "<i>Q</i>. Complying with A's request, the ruler of town T gave A the authority to admit as settlers only those persons of whom A would approve. A claims that B asked him for permission to remain in T for one year telling him that he had settling rights in another place, thus admitting that he possessed no settling-rights in T. B claims that he does possess such rights in T, that his father lived there before him, and denies having asked B for permission to stay there. Should both, B and A, be permitted to stay in T, it might lead to grave consequences, even to the spilling of blood, since B's conduct is known to be corrupt. Rabbi Moses asked what course he should take with respect to their claims.<br><i>A</i>. If A produces witnesses to the effect that B asked permission to remain in T for a year, B will have to leave the town, since by his asking for permission he admitted that he either possessed no settling rights there, or had foregone any rights he might have had. If A can produce no such witnesses, B has a right to dwell in T. However, because of B's wicked conduct, you, Rabbi Moses, should deprive B of his settling rights in T and require A to pay adequate compensation to B. I have often seen communities deprive one of their members of his settling-rights because of misconduct; your court that has the right to confiscate a person's money, surely has the right to deprive one of his settling-rights. You should force, therefore, A and B to leave the case completely in your hands to be decided either by arbitration or according to strictly legal requirements, and then you will be able to decide as you see fit.<br>R. Meir adds:<br>Your opinion that B lost his settling-rights because of the legal principle \"the law of the land prevails\" is untenable. The ruler of T gave A the authority to pass on new settlers, but he gave A no authority to dislodge old residents. Had the ruler of T granted A the authority even to dislodge old residents, the validity of such a grant would depend on the reasons that prompted the ruler to grant such authority. If A asked the ruler for such authority, then A has no right to exercise his authority since by his request he directly injured B's interests. But, if the ruler of T, on his own accord, said that he does not want any Jew to live in T unless he receive A's permission, then A may dislodge B because of the legal principle: \"The law of the land prevails\".<br>The decision of R. Isaac (b. Samuel, the Tosafist) in the case of the Jews who fled from their town and whose real estate the ruler of the town confiscated and, then, sold to other Jews, has nothing to do with our decision. In this latter case, R. Isaac rightly decided that the purchasers must return the property to the original owners (as compensation, the purchasers were entitled to the amount the original owners would have spent to regain their property) for the ruler had no right to confiscate real property that belonged to the Jews for generations. Such an act on the part of the ruler is not considered \"law of the land\" but is rather outright robbery, and, therefore, illegal. In our case, however, the ruler of T is the owner of T and has a right to admit anyone into his town, and to keep out of it anybody he wants to keep out. We cannot claim for B's benefit that his father bought permanent settling rights from the ruler of T and stipulated that he or his descendants could never be dislodged from T, for such transactions were very rare, even though such a stipulation if made would be binding and would render the act of the ruler dislodging B an illegal act.<br>The decision arrived at in the Talmud (B.B. 54b) accepting as binding the Persian law that if the owner of a field defaults in the taxes for that field, anyone who pays the taxes becomes owner of the field, also, has nothing to do with our case; for taxes on real property accumulate even when the owners are away, while Jews are not required to pay taxes to their overlord, unless they actually live in the domain of these overlords. For Jews are not subjugated to their overlords as the Gentiles are, in the sense that they have to pay taxes to a particular overlord even when they do not live in his domain. The status of the Jew, in this land, is that of a free land owner who lost his land but did not lose his personal liberty. This definition of the status of the Jews is followed by the government in its customary relations with the Jews.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 6; Pr. 101, 1001; L. 313; Mord. B.

The affairs of the partners became highly complicated giving rise to litigation, each partner pressing various claims and counterclaims against the other. a) B who lent some of the partnership money on interest, and refused to share the profit on this investment with A, claimed that when he formed the partnership he agreed to share the profit arising out of his buying silver and minting coins, but not out of his money-lending transactions, b) A claimed that he had lent forty pounds to B out of the partnership money, and that B did not repay that debt; B averred that he did repay the forty pounds. c) A claimed that B owed fifteen <i>marks</i> to the partnership, and that the profits that flowed in from Enns, from Neustadt, and from the minters, were included in the fifteen <i>marks</i>. B denied this claim of A. d) A had sent a messenger to Enns to collect ten pounds. The messenger had collected the money but subsequently had lost it. B claimed that A was responsible for this loss since he had appointed the messenger without consulting him. A averred that he had consulted B about it. e) Sixty-one <i>marks</i> were found to be missing from the partnership money. B claimed that the money had been lost while in A's possession, and that the latter was responsible for the loss since he had put the partnership money in the custody of his children who were minors.<br><i>A</i>. a) Since B lent money belonging to the partnership on interest, he must share the profit from these investments with the other partners, even though the partnership was originally formed for other purposes than lending money on interest, unless B had expressly stipulated the condition, at the time the partnership was formed, that he would retain all profits he might earn from money lending; for an agent who employs his principal's money in his own business transactions must share his profits with the principal even though he is fully held responsible for all losses. b) and c) Regarding the other claims and counterclaims of the partners, each partner must take an oath to support his claims and be free from obligation to the partnership. d) A is not responsible for the loss caused by his messenger, since he gave nothing to the messenger, but merely spoke to him. But, if A did give money to the messenger, he must take an oath to support his claim (that he consulted B about appointing the messenger) or to the effect that his partners allowed him a free hand in the management of their affairs, and be free from obligation; otherwise he is to be held responsible for appointing an unreliable messenger. e) If B is positive in his claim that the sixty-one <i>marks</i> were lost while the partnership money was in A's possession, A will have to take an oath denying that the money was lost at that time, or be held responsible for that loss; for putting money in the custody of young children is considered wilful neglect; and a partner, being in the category of a gratuitous bailee, is responsible for wilful neglect. A is to be held responsible for the loss of the ten pounds through his messenger and the loss of the sixty-one <i>marks</i>, only if such losses had occurred before B joined A \"in his work\"; otherwise A can not be held responsible even for wilful neglect, since a bailee is not responsible for losses caused by wilful neglect, if such losses occurred while the owner was with him \"in his work.\"<br>The matter was again sent to R. Meir for his opinion on other problems that arose. f) Regarding the forty pounds lent to B and demanded by A, which B claimed to have repaid, you wrote that both, A and B, were required to take an oath to support their claims. Will A, upon taking such oath, be entitled to collect the forty pounds from B? g) B claimed that A had admitted C into the partnership without his permission. If not for this act of A, he, B, would have earned thirty pounds. A denied B's claim. h) B claimed that towards the end [of their business venture] they had been offered six pounds for the coin [probably the coin-matrix], but that A did not permit him to sell it for that price, while refusing to buy it himself, and thus they lost the six pounds. i) B claimed that C and the \"officers\" [probably the officers of the mint] owed money to the partnership, but that A refused to collect this money. j) A claimed that the sixty-one <i>marks</i> allegedly missing from the partnership money, really represented the payment he had made to the \"treasurers\" in order to free his partners from their obligations to them. He demanded, therefore, that B pay his share of this payment. B stating that the \"treasurers\" depended on him for the repayment of his obligation, denied A's claim and said that A did not go surety for him and was, therefore, not required to pay B's obligation. B further claimed that the above-mentioned money was actually lost because A put it in the custody of his young children. A's youngest child, however, is fifteen years of age.<br><i>A</i>. f) If B takes an oath to the effect that he repaid the forty pounds to A, the partners may hold A responsible for these forty pounds. But if A subsequently takes an oath to the effect that B did not repay the forty pounds, A will be free from obligation to his partners regarding that sum. g) A must take an oath to support his claim. However, if at any time B had shown satisfaction with C's being admitted to the partnership, A's oath is unnecessary. h) Since A did not allow B to sell the coin [matrix] for six pounds hoping to sell it later for more, he can not be held responsible merely because his expectations were not realized. j) Since the money belongs to the partnership, B can sue C and the \"officers\" directly because of the \"lien of R. Nathan\" (garnishment). But, if the \"officers\" are Gentiles and the law of the land does not recognize the validity of the law of garnishment, A must institute proceedings against the \"officers.\" k) I have already written to you that A is not to be held responsible even for losses occasioned by wilful neglect since B was with him \"in his work.\" Moreover, since A's youngest child is fifteen years of age, the putting of money in the custody of his wife and children cannot be considered wilful neglect, since a bailee is expected to deliver his bailment into the hands of his wife and grown up children (B.M. 36a). If the partners, however, have not as yet divided the partnership money among themselves, B may exact an oath from A's children (but not from his wife until she be widowed or divorced) to the effect that they have not misappropriated any of the partnership money. He may exact this oath because of \"the lien of R. Nathan.\" Regarding A's claim to have paid B's obligations to the \"treasurers\", B is free from obligation for that sum; for a person who repays the debt of another has no claim on the latter. However, if A claims that he went surety to the \"treasurers\" for B, the latter must take an oath denying this claim of A, or asserting that he owed nothing to the \"treasurers.\"<br>These Responsa were sent to Vienna, the residence of Rabbi Abigdor haKohen.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 12, 15, 16; Pr. 102; ibid. 490; Am II, 162; Mord.

And even if the [hazan] does not say “Rise, so-and-so the kohen,” so what? Is it obligatory to call out “the kohen”? Even though the contemporary custom is to call the name of those called up to the Torah, this is because otherwise they would bicker. It is nevertheless not obligatory to mention the kohen by name. Moreover, one need not even mention the name; rather, one may gesture with his hand that he should go up. I have heard that this is what R. Shmuel of Bamberg did. Additionally, if a kohen is called after a kohen, it taints [the latter], for people will say that he is not a kohen, but a halal, since he is reading in a place reserved for an Israelite. It is akin to the case of a Levite reading after a Levite, which should not be done because it taints both: they will say that the Levite who reads the third [aliyah] instead of an Israelite is in reality an Israelite.

R. Simha explained that this is not exclusively for a quorum of seven, but even for three,  for the mishna states simply in the third chapter of Megilla (24a) that a minor may read from the Torah and recite the translation. Granted, the Sages conclude there that a woman should not read from the Torah due to the honor of the congregation (kevod ha-tzibur), but where there is no alternative, the honor of the congregation is superseded by the taint on the pedigree of the kohanim called up to read, so that none will say that they are the sons of divorcees.

Of such money, she usually keeps no account, and is not in a position to remember each donation. How, then, can a widow take this oath without violating her conscience?<br><i>A</i>. If the widow can not approximate the exact sum she spent without her husband's knowledge or permission, let her forego a great part of her <i>ketubah</i> rather than hazard the taking of a false oath.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 117."

Hai, that it is collectible even from movable property, unless a custom exists in a particular community that it is not collectible.<br>This decision is based on R. Meir's Responsum as recorded in Pr. 248; Am. II, 64, 65; Tesh. Maim. to Nashim 26; and the opinion expressed in Mord. Ket. 162. But Cr. 116 records the following decision: Since a difference of opinion exists between the <i>Geonim</i>, the burden of proof [to prove according to which authority the law is to be decided] lies on the person who wants to collect money from the other person.<br>Tesh. Maim. <i>ibid</i>. continues: The <i>ketubat benin dichrin</i> is collectible nowadays from both real property and from personal property. As the ordinance of R. Tam, providing that a woman's dowry be returned to her heirs if the woman dies within the first year of marriage, is enforced; surely the ordinance of talmudic scholars, of a similar nature, should be enforced. According to the custom of the communities, the dowry is thus returned to the woman's heirs if she died within two years after her marriage. But R. Meir is of the opinion that the dowry should not be returned to her heirs, but to those who have given it originally. Similarly, R. Meir gave a dowry to his granddaughter Rachel. When she died in the second year of her marriage, R. Meir demanded that the dowry be returned to him although she had other heirs. In some communities only half of the dowry is returned when the woman dies in the second year of her marriage. The ordinance of the communities, which bears the signature of R. David of Merseburg, also has a similar provision.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 116; Pr. 248; Am. II, 64, 65; Tesh. Maim. to <i>Nashim</i>, 26; Mord. Ket. 162. Cf. Asheri Ket. 4, 24."

                "We were obliged to try the case of a betrothed, L, who demanded that her bridegroom, A (Jacob), come to her father's house and marry her there. A's father, B (Moses), representing his son, brought forth the following claims: a) When he (B) had arranged the match with L's father, C (Judah), he had promised C to send his son to live in C's house; b) he kept his promise, and, after A betrothed L through a messenger, he sent A to C; c) at the time the match was arranged C promised to clothe A suitably, to support him, and to hire a capable teacher for him; d) after A stayed in C's house for one year, he was sent back to his father and C took no further notice of him; A was forced to interrupt his studies and he, B, with very limited means, had to support him for five difficult years; and, f) he asked many persons to urge C to keep his promise of support to A, but C refused. The undersigned (R. Meir) also, sent many letters to C, asking him to have pity on his son-in-law who suffered poverty and privation — all to no avail. Moreover, we have learned (from a letter) that C does not at all desire the consummation of the marriage, but has set his heart on a divorce since A displeased him. Thus, B claims that he has fulfilled his promise and sent his son to C; but, that the latter put A to shame and now he, B, can no longer force A to return to C's house; that A is afraid to return to C's place of residence since many persons have warned him that C's servants were threatening to do him injury unless he agree to divorce L; that though A cannot, and will not, return to C, he is nevertheless ready to marry L whenever she will come to his place of residence.<br>Taking the above into consideration, we have decided that A cannot be compelled to settle in C's town, marry L, and live with her there; nor can he be forced to divorce L. Our decision is based on irrefutable proof: Thus, the majority of our leading authorities agree that a man living in one country who betrothed a woman living in another country, may force the woman to come and live with him in his country. Although the Tosephta (Ket. 13, 2) and the Palestinian Talmud, (Ket. 13, 10) seem to disagree on this score, we believe that our interpretation of the statements in these two sources removes the discrepancy and shows that both agree regarding this law. Moreover, when the man betrothed the woman through a messenger, there is not a shadow of a doubt that according to both sources given above, the woman ought to be forced to move to her husband's place of residence. This opinion is shared by Rashi, Maimonides and other leading authorities. R. Tam, however, believes that these sources deal with cases in which we force the husband to change his place of residence to that of his wife. Therefore, in view of this difference of opinion (although I do not agree with the view of R. Tam) we must accept the strictures of each opinion. Thus, we are forced to decide that neither the husband nor the wife can force a change in the other's place of residence. We cannot compel the husband to change his place of residence because of the opinion of Rashi, Maimonides, and the other leading authorities; but neither can we compel the wife to change her place of residence, because of the opinion of R. Tam. Although B had agreed at the time of the betrothal that A would settle in C's town, B had no right to bind A to such terms and we can find no evidence that A had voluntarily agreed to change his place of residence. The fact that A went to visit C is no evidence of such voluntary agreement. Moreover, he went on this visit after the betrothal, while we are concerned with his intentions at the time of the betrothal. Therefore, this agreement between B and C is void. Furthermore, had A himself voluntarily agreed at the time of the betrothal to move to C's place of residence, we should not be able to force A to keep his part of the agreement since C, on his part, had made many promises at that time which he later failed to keep.<br>Some Rabbis wrote their opinion that A should be compelled to move to L's place of residence since it was not dignified for a woman to move from place to place, as expressed by the verse: \"All glorious is the king's daughter within the palace\" (Ps. 45,11; cf. Git. 12a). Moreover, it is humiliating for a woman to pursue her husband into a distant place. However, I regard this manner of reasoning as very strange indeed; for in the talmudic period women were more honorable and discreet than today, and yet talmudic law required them to move to their husband's place of residence. The aforementioned Rabbis also wrote that since, according to the Talmud, a woman's station may be elevated through marriage but not lowered, L should not be forced to move to A's town. For L was brought up in great luxury and abundance, and were she to move to A's house she would have to share his poverty and privation. However, L would not have to suffer privation. C had promised A a large sum of money as a dowry; with that money A should be able to support L in a manner befitting her station, and on a standard equal to that of the other women of her family. Although she would miss some of the extravagances of her father's house, she would have to bear with such minor inconvenience. In conclusion, since A is ready to marry L whenever she will come to live in his town, we cannot compel A to move to L's town or to divorce her. This decision is required by talmudic law and the Rabbis made no distinction between a poor woman and a rich woman. Signed: R. Meir b. Baruch.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 386; Tesh. Maim. to <i>Nashim</i>, 28; Hayyim Or Zarua, <i>Responsa</i> 147. Cf. <i>Hagahot Asheri</i> Ket. 12, 3; Asheri Ket. 13, 17; <i>Tur Eben Haezer</i> 75.<br>The following Responsa by R. Samuel b. Salomo, R. Jacob B. Joseph, R. Yehiel b. Jacob ha Levi, and R. Eliezer B. Ephraim, refer to the same case:<br>This letter is written regarding the youth of Rothenburg who betrothed, through a messenger, the daughter of R. Judah of Düren. At the time the match was concluded the youth's father had agreed that his son would take up his permanent abode with his father-in-law. After the betrothal the bridegroom came to stay with R. Judah who hired a teacher for him and treated him honorably for a long time. A year later the youth became sick and R. Judah, thinking that this was a result of the change of climate, sent him home accompanied by his teacher, and expended large sums of money on him. Subsequently, R. Judah sent for the youth to come to his house and marry his daughter. The youth, however, changed his mind on the matter of residence, and refused to come to Düren, stating however that he was ready to marry his bride if and when she came to live in Rothenburg. Thus it is apparent that the youth was intending to exact money from R. Judah. Therefore, it is my opinion that the youth be forced either to marry his bride on her terms, or divorce her. First, it is obvious that at the time of her betrothal the bridegroom had intended to settle in Düren. Secondly, his father had explicitly agreed with R. Judah to the youth's change of abode. Therefore, we assume that the youth also had agreed to it, since a young son does not dare to oppose his father and usually subscribes to the father's arrangement of his affairs. Again in agreements arising between the various parties interested in a marriage, the conditions apparently implied, though not expressly stated, are presumed to form part of such agreements (see Git. 65b; Ket. 54b; 79a; B. B. 132a). Thus, in our case, it is apparent that R. Judah did not intend to have his daughter leave him and her mother and remove from the country of her birth, and suffer privation in Rothenburg with her poverty stricken husband; that he did not intend to spend the large sum of money required to finance the safe conduct of one who was the daughter of a magnate whose name was known throughout the countries. Thus, the overlord of Rothenburg acting on the mere rumor [that R. Judah's daughter was coming to settle in Rothenburg] already sought ways of subjugating R. Judah to his will [using his daughter as a hostage]. Finally, according to the Talmud (Ket. 110b) a husband cannot force his wife to move from a humble to a more sumptuous dwelling since she can hold that such change of abode, even though it was for the better, would cause her many inconveniences. Any woman who gives plausible reasons against the change of abode demanded by her husband, therefore, cannot be forced to undertake such a change. In our case the bride's reasons against a change of abode are numerous and reasonable. Therefore, the youth ought to be forced by flagellation or the use of the ban either to marry his bride or to divorce her. This case was already brought before us last year, and we decided in the bride's favor. Because of these reasons, I have agreed to ban and chastise the bridegroom until he either marry his bride on her terms or divorce her. If he refuses to comply with our order he shall bear his sin and those who support him shall likewise suffer. None is excluded from our ban, excepting, of course, our honored teacher Rabbi Meir. Rabbenu Gershom requires that a husband be coerced into divorcing his rebellious wife lest the latter turn to mischief. Although many authorities disagree with Rabbenu Gershom and we do not follow his decision, in cases similar to the one at hand, however, we must protect the daughters of Israel lest unscrupulous youths use the inability and unwillingness of daughters of rich men to change their place of residence, as a means of extorting money from their fathers.

                "Wailing and complaint that cannot be silenced, arose because of Jacob b. Moses who betrothed the daughter of R. Judah…. The bridegroom may be coerced either to marry the bride on her terms or divorce her. R. Tam decided that a court must compel a levir to marry, or give <i>halitzah</i> to his brother's childless widow, even by the use of force; and that it is even permissible to have Gentiles use force on the levir until he comply with the decision of the Jewish court. Although according to the Jerusalem Talmud whenever the Mishna fails expressly to allow the use of coercion we can use no physical compulsion (Ket. 11, 7), and although the ban is a strong form of coercion, nevertheless, since R. Tam allowed the use of physical compulsion (in a case where the Mishna does not expressly allow the use of such measures, cf. B. Yeb. 39a) we ought to ban the bridegroom until he comply with our decision. Moreover, custom changes law; whenever we are uncertain regarding a certain law, we observe and follow the accepted practice. Thus, the custom is universally accepted of performing the marriage ceremony in the house of the bride's father. Therefore, we invoked against the youth all the curses great and small, until he comply with our decision. Signed Jacob b. Rabbi Joseph (Pr. 251).<br>To our Rabbis of Germany, your love has obliged me to express my opinion regarding the above. Since witnesses testify to the fact that there was a stipulated condition at the time of the betrothal, such condition is binding and the bridegroom must live up to its terms. Even if there are no such witnesses, the fact that his father-in-law kept him in his house together with his teacher, even though he returned home because of illness, proves that the father-in-law intended that the wedding take place in his house. It is difficult to imagine that the latter intended to brave the grave danger of sending his daughter and his money to Germany, which is very unsafe country. Furthermore, a man may not force his wife to leave her country and to come to live in his country. Therefore, we may force the bridegroom to do one of two things: either marry his bride and come to live in her place of residence, or divorce her. The Rabbis ought to coerce him by the use of chastisement and the ban, for fear lest his bride remain a deserted wife. We find many instances where the Rabbis decreed special laws and took extraordinary measures in order to prevent the possibility of a woman remaining a deserted wife. Signed: Yehiel b. Jacob ha Levi (Pr. 251).<br>To my teacher Rabbi Meir. I saw the decision of the judges in the case of the honorable R. Judah of Düren who betrothed his daughter to Jacob b. Moses of Rothenburg. At the time of the betrothal Moses agreed to send his son Jacob to Düren in order that he marry his bride there. Moses kept his agreement and sent his son to R. Judah. But, when the latter saw that Jacob was small in stature, homely, and despicable, he had pity on his daughter. Fearing lest she begin to despise her bridegroom, he sent Jacob back to his father to stay there till he grow up. When the bride grew up and R. Judah was told that Jacob also gained in strength, he sent for the latter to come and marry his bride. However, Moses refused to send Jacob to Düren. As time dragged on and R. Judah's daughter saw that her bridegroom refused to come to her, she sent a messenger to Rothenburg to demand that Jacob either marry her on the conditions previously agreed upon, or divorce her. But Jacob answered that he did not personally agree to move to Düren, that he did not join in his father's agreement on that score, that he would not come to her father's house, and that he would marry her only if she come to Rothenburg. Thereupon it was decided [by R. Meir] that she could not compel Jacob to move to Düren nor force him to divorce her. This decision, however, is very strange, and, in my opinion, is a perversion of justice for a number of reasons. a) Some of our great authorities quote the opinion of R. Tam to the effect that both the Mishna (Ket. 13, 10) and the Tosephta (Ket. 13, 2) which treat of the conditions under which a party to a marriage may be forced to remove to the place of residence of the other party, deal with forcing the husband to move to the place of residence of the wife. Therefore, the conclusion of both sources is that the husband who married a wife living in another country must move to that country. Again, whenever the talmudic sources state that the husband be so forced to move, the implication is that upon refusing to do so he must divorce his wife and pay her the <i>ketubah</i>. Next, it is well known that the bride's home is luxurious and comfortable [for which reason she ought not to be forced to remove to her husband's humble abode], that her traveling to Rothenburg would entail great difficulties and serious hazards since the entire road is infested with lurking dangers, and that her very stay in Rothenburg would be perilous because of her father's great reputation for wealth. Therefore, Jacob cannot force her to take such a step. Besides, even if she wanted to go to Rothenburg, her father's repeated objections would not allow her to do so, and she could do nothing about it. Therefore, this case is similar to the one quoted in the Mishna (Ket. 13, 5), in which case Admon decided that the bride might demand from her bridegroom that he either marry, or divorce her. Finally, Jacob is bound by his father's agreement, since it is customary for the parents of a couple to enter into all agreements governing the marriage, and for such agreements to be considered binding on the couple. Although the principle is accepted that \"the consent of the father does not imply the consent of the son (Kid. 45b)\", this principle applies only to the actual betrothal but not to the other arrangements appertaining thereto. Moreover, the fact that he came to live in Düren proves that he had agreed to his father's arrangement; while his having been sent home temporarily, because of illness, did not invalidate the original agreement.<br>Therefore, it seems to me that the decision cited above was a perversion of justice, or, at least, against common sense, and not in the interest of the public welfare. For were we to accept the principle implied in your decision, the interests of the wealthy would suffer greatly. Thus many unscrupulous persons, knowing that the daughters of the rich cannot move away from their home towns, would betroth such women and then extort money from their fathers by refusing to marry them until either the women move away from their homeland, or their fathers pay exorbitant sums of money. And you, my teacher, R. Meir, how did you come to subscribe to such a decision? Everybody is wondering at this. For R. Judah is ready to fulfill all his previous promises and more; he wants Jacob and the bride also wants him. They are ready to give guarantees that they will not act treacherously against him; and, in case he does not want her, she is ready to accept her divorce and forego her <i>ketubah</i>. In the face of such facts, how can any Rabbi, student, or judge, give heed to those who insidiously demand that R. Judah's daughter come to live in Rothenburg, knowing full well that she can not do so! It is obvious that these persons are only interested in extorting money from R. Judah, and it is not becoming your dignity to uphold the cause of these extortionists. Should we allow an Israelite daughter to become a deserted wife because her father is averse to becoming a victim of extortion? I know that R. Judah did not acquiesce; that he could not bear the idea of being coerced and forced to part with his money; and that he sent inquiries to the elders, the greatest authorities of France, and to other places. It appears that those authorities have all agreed that Jacob ought to be forced to marry his bride on her own terms or to divorce her. Although you are the greatest authority of our generation, you will not find it easy to oppose the decision of our great authorities, lest dissensions multiply in Israel. \"Therefore, leave off contention, before the quarrel break out\" (Proverbs 17,14).

                "<i>Q</i>. A's window is narrow on the inside and wide on the outside. B, his neighbor, wants to build a wall alongside A's wall and extend it, as far as he is permitted, up to A's window. But, what is considered the window proper? Is it the narrow, inside, opening or the wide, outside, opening? We are inclined to the opinion that the wide, outside, opening is the window proper; some of our Rabbis (colleagues) disagree with us but their reasons for disagreeing are not convincing. Therefore, we want your opinion.<br>Signed: Eliezer b. Shlumiel, Mordecai b. Joseph, Simon Solomon b. Baruch.<br><i>A</i>. The narrow part of the window is the window proper, for two reasons. First, anything a person can build in his house without his neighbor being able to object to it, can not be used as a restriction on such neighbor when he wants to build on his own property. Secondly, a person may increase his lights by beveling the outside border of his window as long as he does not touch the inside border of the window (or vice versa) without his neighbor being able to object to it. Surely one may make his wall very thin without his neighbor being able to object to it; the thinning of the wall has the same effect on the visibility of the window as the bevelling of the border of the window. If one is permissible, so is the other. The neighbor, then, cannot be restrained from placing his wall exactly in the same position he could have placed it before the person widened the outside of his window. B, therefore, may extend his wall up to one <i>tefah</i> of the narrow part of A's window.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 11; Pr. 321; P. 528; Mord. B. B. 523; Hag. Maim., <i>Shekenim</i>, 7, 3.

                "<i>Q</i>. I was wondering at your method of taking <i>Hallah</i> from unleavened cakes; for, after they were baked you put all the cakes into a basket and took one cake as <i>Hallah</i> for the rest. It is true that in the Mishnah (<i>Hallah</i> 2,4.) R. Eliezer decides that cakes taken from different pieces of dough may be joined for the purpose of taking <i>Hallah</i> by putting them in one basket. But this law of R. Eliezer is only a restrictive measure in order to require the taking of <i>Hallah</i> from small pieces of dough (by putting them together in a basket), which are, by themselves, too small to necessitate the taking of <i>Hallah</i> from them. But R. Eliezer never meant his law to be a palliative measure. I, therefore, take a small piece from each quantity of dough that is separately mixed, and then join the small pieces into one piece as <i>Hallah</i>.<br>Signed: R. Isaac b. Simeon.<br><i>A</i>. Throughout France <i>Hallah</i> is being taken from unleavened cakes by uniting them in a basket. This method is approved by the author of <i>Sefer ha-Terumah</i>, and the author of <i>Eben ha-Ezer</i>.

The affairs of the partners became highly complicated giving rise to litigation, each partner pressing various claims and counterclaims against the other. a) B who lent some of the partnership money on interest, and refused to share the profit on this investment with A, claimed that when he formed the partnership he agreed to share the profit arising out of his buying silver and minting coins, but not out of his money-lending transactions, b) A claimed that he had lent forty pounds to B out of the partnership money, and that B did not repay that debt; B averred that he did repay the forty pounds. c) A claimed that B owed fifteen <i>marks</i> to the partnership, and that the profits that flowed in from Enns, from Neustadt, and from the minters, were included in the fifteen <i>marks</i>. B denied this claim of A. d) A had sent a messenger to Enns to collect ten pounds. The messenger had collected the money but subsequently had lost it. B claimed that A was responsible for this loss since he had appointed the messenger without consulting him. A averred that he had consulted B about it. e) Sixty-one <i>marks</i> were found to be missing from the partnership money. B claimed that the money had been lost while in A's possession, and that the latter was responsible for the loss since he had put the partnership money in the custody of his children who were minors.<br><i>A</i>. a) Since B lent money belonging to the partnership on interest, he must share the profit from these investments with the other partners, even though the partnership was originally formed for other purposes than lending money on interest, unless B had expressly stipulated the condition, at the time the partnership was formed, that he would retain all profits he might earn from money lending; for an agent who employs his principal's money in his own business transactions must share his profits with the principal even though he is fully held responsible for all losses. b) and c) Regarding the other claims and counterclaims of the partners, each partner must take an oath to support his claims and be free from obligation to the partnership. d) A is not responsible for the loss caused by his messenger, since he gave nothing to the messenger, but merely spoke to him. But, if A did give money to the messenger, he must take an oath to support his claim (that he consulted B about appointing the messenger) or to the effect that his partners allowed him a free hand in the management of their affairs, and be free from obligation; otherwise he is to be held responsible for appointing an unreliable messenger. e) If B is positive in his claim that the sixty-one <i>marks</i> were lost while the partnership money was in A's possession, A will have to take an oath denying that the money was lost at that time, or be held responsible for that loss; for putting money in the custody of young children is considered wilful neglect; and a partner, being in the category of a gratuitous bailee, is responsible for wilful neglect. A is to be held responsible for the loss of the ten pounds through his messenger and the loss of the sixty-one <i>marks</i>, only if such losses had occurred before B joined A \"in his work\"; otherwise A can not be held responsible even for wilful neglect, since a bailee is not responsible for losses caused by wilful neglect, if such losses occurred while the owner was with him \"in his work.\"<br>The matter was again sent to R. Meir for his opinion on other problems that arose. f) Regarding the forty pounds lent to B and demanded by A, which B claimed to have repaid, you wrote that both, A and B, were required to take an oath to support their claims. Will A, upon taking such oath, be entitled to collect the forty pounds from B? g) B claimed that A had admitted C into the partnership without his permission. If not for this act of A, he, B, would have earned thirty pounds. A denied B's claim. h) B claimed that towards the end [of their business venture] they had been offered six pounds for the coin [probably the coin-matrix], but that A did not permit him to sell it for that price, while refusing to buy it himself, and thus they lost the six pounds. i) B claimed that C and the \"officers\" [probably the officers of the mint] owed money to the partnership, but that A refused to collect this money. j) A claimed that the sixty-one <i>marks</i> allegedly missing from the partnership money, really represented the payment he had made to the \"treasurers\" in order to free his partners from their obligations to them. He demanded, therefore, that B pay his share of this payment. B stating that the \"treasurers\" depended on him for the repayment of his obligation, denied A's claim and said that A did not go surety for him and was, therefore, not required to pay B's obligation. B further claimed that the above-mentioned money was actually lost because A put it in the custody of his young children. A's youngest child, however, is fifteen years of age.<br><i>A</i>. f) If B takes an oath to the effect that he repaid the forty pounds to A, the partners may hold A responsible for these forty pounds. But if A subsequently takes an oath to the effect that B did not repay the forty pounds, A will be free from obligation to his partners regarding that sum. g) A must take an oath to support his claim. However, if at any time B had shown satisfaction with C's being admitted to the partnership, A's oath is unnecessary. h) Since A did not allow B to sell the coin [matrix] for six pounds hoping to sell it later for more, he can not be held responsible merely because his expectations were not realized. j) Since the money belongs to the partnership, B can sue C and the \"officers\" directly because of the \"lien of R. Nathan\" (garnishment). But, if the \"officers\" are Gentiles and the law of the land does not recognize the validity of the law of garnishment, A must institute proceedings against the \"officers.\" k) I have already written to you that A is not to be held responsible even for losses occasioned by wilful neglect since B was with him \"in his work.\" Moreover, since A's youngest child is fifteen years of age, the putting of money in the custody of his wife and children cannot be considered wilful neglect, since a bailee is expected to deliver his bailment into the hands of his wife and grown up children (B.M. 36a). If the partners, however, have not as yet divided the partnership money among themselves, B may exact an oath from A's children (but not from his wife until she be widowed or divorced) to the effect that they have not misappropriated any of the partnership money. He may exact this oath because of \"the lien of R. Nathan.\" Regarding A's claim to have paid B's obligations to the \"treasurers\", B is free from obligation for that sum; for a person who repays the debt of another has no claim on the latter. However, if A claims that he went surety to the \"treasurers\" for B, the latter must take an oath denying this claim of A, or asserting that he owed nothing to the \"treasurers.\"<br>These Responsa were sent to Vienna, the residence of Rabbi Abigdor haKohen.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 12, 15, 16; Pr. 102; ibid. 490; Am II, 162; Mord.

Is A to be considered a rebellious husband and hence should three denars per week be added to his wife's <i>ketubah</i> for the period of his abstention?<br><i>A</i>. Since A was forced by illness to refrain from intercourse with his wife, he is not to be considered a rebellious husband. A rebellious husband is one who refuses to live with his wife because he is angry with her or because he hates her. A person who is physically unable to live with his wife, however, is not considered a rebellious husband. A, however, must divorce his wife and must pay her the <i>ketubah</i>, since he is in the same category as a leper for whom coitus is harmful (Ket. 77b). Although A's sickness does not disable him permanently and is curable, we do not compel his wife to wait indefinitely in the hope that he might be cured. Thus Maimonides (M. T. Ishut 14, 7) rules that under such circumstances a woman must wait only six months. Although we have compared A to a leper for whom coitus is harmful, nevertheless we should not force A by flagellation to divorce his wife, but should only resort to persuasion. We should merely tell him the law requires him to divorce his wife and pay her the <i>ketubah</i>; should he refuse to do so, he would be called \"transgressor\". Whether A divorces her or not, however, we force him to pay his wife the <i>Ikkar ketubah</i> and her dowry, but we do not force him to pay her the additional jointure since some authorities hold the opinion that under the circumstances she is not entitled to the additional jointure. Should A's wife aver that she does not believe that A's doctors told him to refrain from sexual intercourse, and insist that he is a rebellious husband, he would have to take an oath in support of his assertions. Should A refuse to take the oath, we would have to add to his wife's <i>ketubah</i> three Tyrian denars per week for the entire period of his abstention. I have sufficient proof to support my view that the three denars prescribed by the Mishnah (Ket. 5, 7) mean Tyrian denars. Should A admit that he had refrained from sexual intercourse with his wife because he was angry with her and that he had lied about both his sickness and the advice of his doctors, and should he declare that he now desires to resume marital relations with her, the aforementioned amount would be added to her <i>ketubah</i> and she would be required to resume her marital duties. Regardless of what happened in the past, A may now claim that he is well and that he is able to live normally with his wife, since the truth of his claim is bound eventually to be proven or disproven.<br>This Responsum is addressed to: \"Rabbi Isaac, my relatives Rabbi Joel and Rabbi Ephraim\".<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Sinai V (1941) pp. 203–6; ibid. pp. 294–5; <i>Mordecai Hagadol</i>, p. 159c; Pr. 574."

                "Most scholars hold the opinion that a woman whose husband fell into a body of water whose final boundaries are not discernible, and who, though not permitted to remarry, defiantly transgressed against the prohibition of the Rabbis and did remarry, need not be divorced from her second husband. This opinion they base on the talmudic ruling that the law prohibiting the remarriage of a woman whose husband fell into a \"boundless\" body of water, applies only before, but not after, she has remarried. I once saw a prominent personage of our kingdom remarry under such circumstances without any one admonishing her. All our prominent scholars decided that she need not be divorced, once she has remarried. A great French scholar was then staying in our kingdom, and he, too, permitted her to stay married claiming that he had witnessed a similar case in France and that all the great scholars of France ruled that she need not be divorced. I also gave my consent to his decision though I was hesitant. However, I have finally come to the conclusion that such an opinion is untenable. For, were this opinion correct the prohibition of the Rabbis would be rendered senseless, useless, and ridiculous, since no woman would heed such prohibition and would transgress against it rather than stay single all her life. Why, then, would the Rabbis prohibit such remarriage to begin with! Therefore, we must say that the talmudic ruling which does not require the remarried woman to be divorced, refers only to that woman who remarried because she innocently believed that a scholar had permitted her to do so, as in the case of Hassa (Yeb. 121b) and that of R. Shila (Yeb. 121a); but that it does not refer to the woman who defiantly transgressed the prohibition of the Rabbis. This latter interpretation of the pertinent talmudic sources clarifies the words of the Rabbis and renders them logical and tenable. Therefore, a woman who remarried without receiving permission from a scholar must be divorced, or the husband be put under the ban till he divorce her. We must not be concerned lest a relative of the woman permit her to remarry (thus flouting the prohibition of the Rabbis), for the following reasons: a) only a scholar holding the position among scholars that R. Nahman (the scholar who inadvertantly caused the wife of Hassa to remarry) and R. Shila held in their day, is empowered to permit such a woman to remarry; b) a scholar permitting such a woman to remarry would bring upon himself the ban.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 194; Am II, 97; Mord.

As corroborative evidence of the legality of this procedure I cite the talmudic ruling that those who pay the capitation tax for others are justified in forcing the latter in their service (B. M. 73b), since \"the law of the land prevails\". Moreover, since the members of the community are partners in the payment of the taxes, no individual may willfully withdraw from the partnership. Since the majority (of the members of a community) may force the minority to abide by its rulings (B. B. 8b), it may certainly force an individual to pay his taxes. The burden of proof to the contrary rests upon the person who seeks to deviate from this rule.<br>Since the overlord customarily collects his taxes collectively from the entire community, the exact obligation of each member of the community regarding such tax becomes determined as if already collected (the very moment the overlord demands the collective tax); and if the overlord subsequently desires to free or relieve one member at the expense of the others, he has no right to do so. Such an act on his part is not considered \"law of the land,\" but rather constitutes outright robbery, and is, therefore, not valid.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 49; Pr. 708, 915; L. 371; Am II, 130.

The Jews of T who have banded together in electing leaders and giving them authority to manage all communal affairs, had no right to do so even though they represented a majority of the Jewish inhabitants of T, as long as a minority took no part in the reorganization, for no new custom or institution can be established in a community without the knowledge and consent of all its inhabitants. The talmudic statement: \"The inhabitants of a city are permitted to enforce their rulings\" (B.B. 8b), means: a) If the people of a city unanimously agree to enact a certain ruling, they are permitted to punish and fine anyone who subsequently disregards that ruling; or, b) the seven leaders of a community, originally elected with the knowledge and consent of all the members of the community to manage community affairs and to punish offenders, have the right to enforce their rulings and decrees. But, no majority of city dwellers can force a minority to be governed by a ruling to the original passing of which they have not consented, or to accept the authority of leaders whom they have not consented to elect.<br>Moreover, any ordinance passed by the inhabitants of a city without the knowledge or consent of a great man (a scholar) residing in their midst, is void and is not binding even upon those who passed the ordinance (B.B. 9a). There can be no doubt, therefore, that no community can pass an ordinance to be binding upon the scholar himself, unless he agrees to its enactment. Thus, an organization established against the express wishes of R. Meir Kohen, a person of high standing and scholarship, has no right to force its authority on all the inhabitants of T. Therefore, R. Meir had the right to resort to the help of Gentiles in order to recover his valuables.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 968; <i>Mordecai Hagadol</i>, p. 299c; ibid. p. 363b."

If A admits that the money he borrowed belonged to the orphans, but claims to have repaid part of it, the trustee is believed as to the amount he received from A, (in repayment of the loan), and is not required to take an oath since the trustee is a disinterested third party. But if A states his belief that the trustee loaned him his own money, and not the orphans' money, the trustee must take an oath as to the amount he received from A in repayment of the loan, though he is not required to take an oath to the effect that the money he loaned belonged to the orphans.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 969; Mord.

How can the judges enforce the collection of such money when R. Hai Gaon and R. Hananel ruled that these transactions were invalid? Moreover, occasionally the conditional transaction is not concluded before an authoritative court, but the scribe inserts the phrases: \"accompanied by a <i>kinyan</i>, made before an authoritative court\", as a mere formality.

As to your second objection, if the scribe was instructed by the contracting party (or parties) to draw up the contract, we assume that he was thus instructed to draw up a valid contract in accordance with accepted custom.

He demands that B permit him to redeem his books. B claims: a) that when A gave him the books, he, A, undertook to make good all damages incurred in securing the loan; b) that he, B, suffered damages because of his endeavors on A's behalf; c) that A sent word to R. Yedidyah and to B, to sell two books; d) that he, B, gave the two books to Rabbi Yedidyah who sold them, but who now refuses to give the money to B. A, however, claims that he only advised B to secure the aid of Rabbi Yedidyah in selling the books, since R. Yedidyah knew their value and how to sell them, but that he did not permit B to give the books to R. Yedidyah. Moreover, A claims that R.

A's widow, Leah, and his children put forth their claims, through representatives, regarding real property left to A by his mother on condition that after A's death the property be transferred to A's children and not be used to pay Leah's <i>ketubah</i>. Leah claimed that the said property never belonged to A's mother since the latter received it in payment of her <i>ketubah</i>, but failed to take the required oath before collecting such <i>ketubah</i>. Leah, therefore, demanded her <i>ketubah</i> from this property. A's sons, then, produced a document to the effect that A, foregoing the required oath, permitted his mother to take the property of his deceased father in payment of her <i>ketubah</i>, and bestowed upon her as a gift whatever amount the property was worth in excess of her <i>ketubah</i>. Leah, however, claimed that as soon as her father-in-law died, his property, automatically falling to her husband, was subject to the lien of her <i>ketubah</i>, and that A, therefore, had no right to waive the oath his mother was required to take and to bestow gifts upon her without her (Leah's) permission.<br><i>A</i>. The property belongs to the grandchildren who were already born at the time the gift was made by A's mother, and Leah cannot collect her <i>ketubah</i> therefrom.

While pressed for money, A agreed to sell his house to C for one hundred twenty-five pounds, and promised him by solemn hand-clasp that if his neighbors (who owned the adjoining property) refused to buy the house for the stated sum, he would sell it only to C. Complying with C's demand A deposited a pledge of ten pounds with B to be delivered to C in case A did not keep his promise. A's neighbors agreed to buy the house for the price mentioned above. Meanwhile, A received money from a different source and after a conference with his relatives, he refused to sell the house altogether. A's neighbors summoned him to court claiming that he tricked them and that he used them as a means to free himself from his obligation to C. A, therefore, had to take an oath (in the form of a <i>herem</i>) that he had no intentions of trickery. Subsequently, with his pledge still in the hands of the trustee, B, A went to the Rabbis of a certain community and explained the situation to them. The Rabbis informed him that he did not lose his pledge since the consent of the neighbors to buy his house automatically voided his agreement with C. A, therefore, now demands his pledge from B. B, however, claims that A's agreement with C was that if A's neighbors did not buy his house by a certain date, A would sell it to C or forfeit the pledge. A single witness supports B's claim. B further claims that after the appointed time passed he delivered the pledge to C as instructed. Signed: Judah b. Rabbi Meshulam.<br><i>A</i>. A's agreement to give C ten pounds in case he, A, does not keep his promise, is considered an <i>Asmakta</i>; and since the agreement was not made in the presence of an authoritative court, and was not accompanied by a <i>Kinyan</i>, it is not binding. A promised C by solemn hand-clasp to sell him the house, but no such hand-clasp accompanied A's agreement to pay the fine of ten pounds; therefore, A is under no obligation to pay ten pounds to C. And, since according to A's report of his agreement with C such agreement was voided by the neighbor's consent to buy the house, A is under no obligation to C, and B must return to A his ten pounds. The testimony of the single witness — that A promised by solemn hand-clasp to sell his house to C if his neighbors would not buy it by a certain date — does not oblige A to take an oath denying the truth of such testimony. For a solemn hand-clasp is equivalent to an oath; thus, if the testimony of the witness is true, A is already under a solemn obligation to sell his house to C and an oath is unnecessary.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 996; <i>Mordecai Hagadol</i> p. 265 b; ibid. 277d."

A claims that B asked him for permission to remain in T for one year telling him that he had settling rights in another place, thus admitting that he possessed no settling-rights in T. B claims that he does possess such rights in T, that his father lived there before him, and denies having asked B for permission to stay there. Should both, B and A, be permitted to stay in T, it might lead to grave consequences, even to the spilling of blood, since B's conduct is known to be corrupt. Rabbi Moses asked what course he should take with respect to their claims.<br><i>A</i>. If A produces witnesses to the effect that B asked permission to remain in T for a year, B will have to leave the town, since by his asking for permission he admitted that he either possessed no settling rights there, or had foregone any rights he might have had. If A can produce no such witnesses, B has a right to dwell in T. However, because of B's wicked conduct, you, Rabbi Moses, should deprive B of his settling rights in T and require A to pay adequate compensation to B. I have often seen communities deprive one of their members of his settling-rights because of misconduct; your court that has the right to confiscate a person's money, surely has the right to deprive one of his settling-rights. You should force, therefore, A and B to leave the case completely in your hands to be decided either by arbitration or according to strictly legal requirements, and then you will be able to decide as you see fit.<br>R. Meir adds:<br>Your opinion that B lost his settling-rights because of the legal principle \"the law of the land prevails\" is untenable. The ruler of T gave A the authority to pass on new settlers, but he gave A no authority to dislodge old residents. Had the ruler of T granted A the authority even to dislodge old residents, the validity of such a grant would depend on the reasons that prompted the ruler to grant such authority. If A asked the ruler for such authority, then A has no right to exercise his authority since by his request he directly injured B's interests. But, if the ruler of T, on his own accord, said that he does not want any Jew to live in T unless he receive A's permission, then A may dislodge B because of the legal principle: \"The law of the land prevails\".<br>The decision of R. Isaac (b. Samuel, the Tosafist) in the case of the Jews who fled from their town and whose real estate the ruler of the town confiscated and, then, sold to other Jews, has nothing to do with our decision. In this latter case, R. Isaac rightly decided that the purchasers must return the property to the original owners (as compensation, the purchasers were entitled to the amount the original owners would have spent to regain their property) for the ruler had no right to confiscate real property that belonged to the Jews for generations. Such an act on the part of the ruler is not considered \"law of the land\" but is rather outright robbery, and, therefore, illegal. In our case, however, the ruler of T is the owner of T and has a right to admit anyone into his town, and to keep out of it anybody he wants to keep out. We cannot claim for B's benefit that his father bought permanent settling rights from the ruler of T and stipulated that he or his descendants could never be dislodged from T, for such transactions were very rare, even though such a stipulation if made would be binding and would render the act of the ruler dislodging B an illegal act.<br>The decision arrived at in the Talmud (B.B. 54b) accepting as binding the Persian law that if the owner of a field defaults in the taxes for that field, anyone who pays the taxes becomes owner of the field, also, has nothing to do with our case; for taxes on real property accumulate even when the owners are away, while Jews are not required to pay taxes to their overlord, unless they actually live in the domain of these overlords. For Jews are not subjugated to their overlords as the Gentiles are, in the sense that they have to pay taxes to a particular overlord even when they do not live in his domain. The status of the Jew, in this land, is that of a free land owner who lost his land but did not lose his personal liberty.

L claims that she cannot afford to live in one place and provide food for R and her servant in another place. R refuses to leave her city, her daughter, her relatives, and the place where she can pray with a <i>minyan</i>. Can R compel L to provide food for her in R's city; and is not the contract void since in case L died before R and the latter reclaimed her money, the food L provided her with would constitute illegal interest?<br><i>A</i>. L cannot force R to come to live with her, and R can not force L to support her while L is away, for neither of them would have entered into the original agreement had they forseen such eventualities. Moreover, the contract is void since there is a possibility that the food R receives from L would constitute illegal interest on R's money. L, therefore, should deduct from the fifteen <i>marks</i>, the amount she expended on R's food, and return the rest to R.<br><i>Q</i>. R drew an instrument in which she stated that from then on and after her death, her (real) estate should belong to her brother, to certain people and to charity, on condition that she retain the right to sell any part of it if hard pressed for funds with which to feed and clothe herself. R, now, desires to sell part of her property claiming that she needs the money for her sustenance. The charity-trustee refuses to grant her permission to do so, claiming that R is not hard pressed for funds since she receives her food from L and since she has sufficient clothes.<br><i>A</i>. If it is known that R is not in dire need of money for her sustenance, she may not sell any part of her property. But if this is not a known fact, R may promise under oath that she will not sell any part of her property unless she will need the money for her sustenance. She will be permitted, then, to sell such part of her property the proceeds of which will suffice for her sustenace for a period of six months. That money should be deposited with a trustee who would pay her a monthly allowance.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 1006."

R. Jacob Tam applies the aforesaid talmudic injunction only to mercantile pursuits but not to cases where a person is about to pick up a lost or ownerless object and another snatches it away. For finding a lost object is a rare opportunity and the second person is just as much entitled to the ownerless object as the first person. Buying abutting property from a Gentile is also a rare opportunity and is in the same category as picking up lost objects. Therefore, B is free from any obligation to A. A Jew should not approach a seller where another Jew had already agreed with the seller for the sale of the article, and where the writing of the contract and the scrutiny and transfer of the deed in the Gentile courts are the only things lacking in order to complete the sale. But, the mere offer of a Jew to buy something without the seller's acceptance of the offer, does not restrain another Jew from buying it. If such were the case, it would be very unfair to the seller who would be forced to sell his possessions to the very first bidder, no matter how low the offer, since no other purchasers would dare to buy it.

                "<i>Q</i>. a) A decided to remove from his province and from the jurisdiction of his overlord, and to settle in a town where B and his friends lived. Before taking up his residence under the new overlord he came to an agreement with him regarding the amount of taxes he was to pay, and further arranged to pay such taxes to him directly. A, therefore, refused to participate with the other members of the community whenever they jointly paid their taxes to the overlord. Hence they with B invoked against A the ban proclaimed by the communities against any one who refused to pay his taxes jointly with his community. Did A have the right to pay his taxes independently of the community?<br>b) For many years C resided in a locality where he paid his taxes jointly with D and the other Jews of the surrounding territory. He finally decided to sever his connections with them and made a separate agreement with the overlord to pay him a certain sum as a yearly tax. D and the other taxpayers strongly objected to this and therefore C came to an agreement with D and some of his friends. Others, however, still continued to raise objections to the course undertaken by C. Furthermore, whenever the ban (for nonpayment of taxes) was pronounced, it was couched in general terms which did not exclude C from it. Was C justified in his act?<br>c) Our overlord granted a release from taxation for the first year, to all Jews coming to settle in his territory. This release was granted against the wishes of the Jews already settled there. The new settlers paid no taxes during their first year of settlement in accordance with the above-mentioned release. But when payment of the taxes for the second year fell due, the old settlers, refusing to recognize the release granted by the overlord, forced the new settlers to pay taxes for both the current and the preceding years. Subsequently the overlord died and was succeeded by his son. The new and old settlers paid their taxes regularly without a complaint for many years. This year, however, quarrelsome persons came to settle here and they refused to pay their taxes for the first year because of the release granted by the father of the present overlord. Were they justified in their refusal?<br><i>A</i>. A person settling in a town has no right to isolate himself from the rest of the community and pay his taxes independently. All (Jewish) dwellers in a town are partners in the expenses of maintaining the townwall, the horse guard, the armory and the city gates (B. B. 8a), and must share in paying the town safety tax, in maintaining the free kitchen and the charity chest, and in contributing to similar town expenses, such as a tax to the overlord who is responsible for the safety of the town. Since every town dweller is a partner in these expenses, no partner is permitted (according to talmudic law) to withdraw from a partnership without the consent of the other partners. Moreover, were paying of taxes independently of the community not forbidden by talmudic law, such practice would be proscribed by custom; for throughout the kingdom the custom of considering all taxpayers of a community as partners, and of not allowing anyone to pay his taxes independently, is well established. If not for this rule, equitable distribution of the burden of taxation would be impossible and endless quarrels would ensue, endangering the position of the Jew among his neighbors. Therefore, the community has a right to restrain A (and C) from paying taxes independently, even if only a single member of the community objects to such independent payment of taxes. The community has a right to use persuasion or force upon A and C, by flagellation, ban, or edict of excommunication. You have my full consent to resort to these coercive measures. The same rule applies to the quarrelsome new settlers (referred to in the third query). They must pay their full share of the taxes, even for the first year of their settlement.<br>These queries were sent to R. Meir by the Jews of Stendal. The following statements are appended.<br>I subscribe to the opinion of my teacher and relative, R. Meir, that they can not separate themselves from the community without its permission; for the goods of one town dweller may be mortgaged for the unpaid taxes of another town dweller (B. K. 113b).

                "a) <i>Q</i>. M(eir) settled in the town T and lived there for many years buying houses and planting vineyards and groves. While he was alive certain persons contested his right to settle in T, but R. Judah ha-Kohen confirmed M's settling-rights. Now (after M's death) some inhabitants of T seek to oust M's son-in-law claiming that M possessed no settling rights in T.<br><i>A</i>. Since R. Judah, my teacher and relative, acting in his official capacity as judge, confirmed M's settling-rights, no one is permitted to contest these rights of M. For, R. Judah deserves complete reliance on, and respect for his decisions. Therefore, you ought to silence all contestants by decree.<br>b) You state in your letter that two years ago you inquired of me regarding R. Isaac son of Rehabiah whose settling right was contested by the leading inhabitants of the town and that at that time we (?) had confirmed R. Isaac's right on the following grounds: a) witnesses testified that his father dwelt in this town for a year or two without disturbance; b) after his father's death he dwelt here for three years without disturbance; and c) in such cases the court puts forth the claim (for the heir) that had the father been alive he would have claimed to have bought (or obtained) settling-rights from the other dwellers of the town (and would have needed no further evidence under the circumstances). I have heard my teacher R. Judah ha-Kohen decide cases of settling-rights-disputes on the grounds quoted above; but I do not believe that such decisions are correct. According to talmudic law, undisturbed possession is not a factor in disputes involving settling-rights. Persons dwelling on their property during its occupancy by another, do not have to protest such occupancy since they are always in possession of their property (B.B. 29b). Therefore, the failure of the inhabitants of the town to protest against R. Isaac's settling in their midst, is of no consequence, and the decision given above is, indeed, faulty. However, it is possible that my teacher (R. Judah) arrived at such decision by following not talmudic law but community practice. Many communities accept, as legal, methods of proving a person's settling-rights that have no basis in, and that are entirely unacceptable to, talmudic law. For, settling rights are governed by the customs and practices of each particular community. The customs of the various communities differ from one another and are not at all dependent on strict talmudic law. R. Judah, therefore, finding a parallel in talmudic law, wanted to institute the custom of accepting undisturbed possession as a method of proving a person's settling rights. This custom ought to be followed in the communities where R. Judah instituted it (in deference to this scholar), and is in itself worthy to be followed in other communities as well.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 213."

The inhabitants of a town are the only ones who know whether or not a person possesses settling-rights, but such inhabitants are interested witnesses. Moreover, even they rarely remember what had happened years ago, and merely report vague memories, impressions, and hearsay. Therefore, when two groups of witnesses contradict each other, we admit the testimony of the group that has the most members.

B, on the other hand, claimed that the money was given to him by the grandfather and mother of the orphans with the condition that he do not return it under any circumstances, not even to themselves, until the orphans grow up and get married; that he now intended to abide by this agreement even though the grandfather died meanwhile and his heirs have demanded the return of this money; and that he was richer at this time than two years previously, since at that time he owned no real estate while now he did, and also had property of his own.<br><i>A</i>.

If they were duly appointed as trustees for the orphans, they ought to be discharged for lending money belonging to orphans without adequate security, and without receiving notes of indebtedness, and on terms injurious to the orphans' interests; since according to the agreement the orphans were to share in the losses, as well as in the profits, resulting from B's transactions. Such money must be lent to a rich and trustworthy man, on adequate security, and on condition that the orphans share only in the profits but not in the losses. Any trustee not heeding this rule could be discharged without notice for damaging the orphans' interests, and the agreements he had entered into would become void at the time he was discharged. Since B admitted that the money lent to him belonged to orphans, and that it was lent to him on conditions injurious to the latter, the agreement he entered into with the trustees of said orphans, was void, and he had to return the money.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 211; L. 220; Tesh.

While taking the oath the Jews made mental reservations, to their verbal statements, which they believed invalidated the oath. They proceeded, therefore, to clip the coins.<br><i>A</i>. Whether or not one has taken an oath not to clip coins, the doing so is a serious crime, the perpetrators of which deserve severe punishment. Clipping coins is tantamount to stealing and robbing, and robbing Gentiles is a crime. Furthermore, such an act creates a public nuisance as it may result in causing great injury to other Jews innocently passing on these coins. It may even cause widespread disaster, and has already led to a great deal of bloodshed. Thus, clipping coins brought about the destruction of our brethren in France and Britain. In addition to committing a basic crime, these Jews broke their solemn oath to the burghers. Mental reservations do not invalidate an oath occasioned by legal circumstances. The talmudic ruling (Ned. 28a) that a person may invalidate his oath to extortionists and murderers by mental reservations, does not apply in this case; for, while extortionists and murderers, by administering an oath, strive to bolster their criminal purposes, it is legal and proper for a king or civil authority to forbid the clipping of coins. Therefore, their oath to the burghers was valid despite their mental reservations. Moreover, when the Gentiles will learn that the Jews clipped coins despite their oath — and they are bound to discover it sooner or later — they will suspect the Jews of wilfully breaking their oath. Should the latter inform the Gentiles that they disregarded their oath because of mental reservations, the consequences might be still more serious; for Gentiles will never again believe a Jew under oath.

The woman denied his claim. I freed the woman from obligation for the following reason: Even if the woman promised a fee to the matchmaker he would not be entitled to collect it since he occupied himself with this match because of the money promised to him by her husband.

                "R. Isaac left his wife Sarah in the month of <i>Adar</i> of the year 5031 (1271), and travelled to a distant place in search of sustenance for his family. Next year he learned that his wife had played the harlot and had thus become pregnant. He returned home, and in the month of <i>Ab</i> of the year 5032 (1272) he appeared before us and asked us to investigate his wife's conduct during his absence, since she bore a child in the month of Adar of the same year (1272), twelve months after he had left her. Sarah asserted, however, that she was pregnant when her husband left her. Therefore we, the undersigned, wrote to R. Shealtiel and his two sons, who lived in the same village with Sarah, and they testified in writing that Sarah bore a child twelve months after R. Isaac left her. The signatures and seals of the deponents have been attested to by reliable witnesses. Then, a person appeared before us because of the ban (proclaimed against all those who knew anything relating to this case and did not appear as witnesses) and testified that on the evening of <i>Shabuot</i> of the previous year (1271) he went to Sarah's home in order to recite the <i>kiddush</i> in her presence, and found Gentiles, loafers, who caroused with her, caressed and embraced her. We concluded, therefore, that she must have become pregnant at that time. Other persons testified to have seen her on <i>Purim</i> of this year (1272) in the last stages of pregnancy. On previous occasions, however, in the month of <i>Elul</i>, she violently protested that she was not pregnant, and cursed and abused those who had said to her that she was pregnant. Moreover, before the evil report reached the town, Sarah's father appeared before us and asked us to allow him to put his daughter to death by drowning her. When asked for his reasons, he stated that a daughter of his (meaning Sarah) was an incorrigible harlot, who bore a bastard daughter by a Gentile and then killed her child. When asked whether he tried other means of controlling her, he answered that whenever he reproved her she threatened to apostatize altogether and pleaded that she was not the first woman who ever sinned. She had left the house on a number of occasions but was persuaded to return by the entreaties of her mother. The father feared lest she turn to evil and, therefore, asked for permission to kill her. However, we did not permit him to carry out his design. We sent the testimony to Rothenburg to the great luminary, Rabbi Meir. Since the Rabbis of Erfurt who are near us, and those of Würzburg, who are far from us, as well as Rabbi Meir of Rothenburg, all agree to allow R. Isaac to divorce Sarah even against her will, the divorce has been given in our presence. Signed: Moses Azriel b. Eleazar hadarshan, Eleazar b. Yehiel, Ephraim b. Joel.<br>R. Meir's opinion was as follows:<br>The testimony of R. Shealtiel and his sons is of no consequence for two reasons. a) They are related to each other; their testimony is that of a single witness, and, therefore, insufficient. b) The foetus could have lingered in the mother's womb for twelve months (cf. Yeb. 80b). Sarah's giving birth to a child twelve months after her husband left her, is, therefore, no proof of her depravity. The testimony of the other witness regarding Sarah's indecent behavior on the evening of <i>Shabuot</i>, being the testimony of a single witness, does not deprive Sarah of her right to her <i>ketubah</i>. If R. Isaac believes the aforementioned witness or if he takes the word of his wife's own father, he must divorce Sarah even against her will. If she renders it impossible for him to divorce her, he may marry another woman without divorcing Sarah as a warning to all indecent and depraved women. But he must pay Sarah her <i>ketubah</i>. However, if Sarah admits her guilt, or acknowledges the truth of the testimony regarding her indecent conduct on the evening of <i>Shabuot</i>, or if she cannot satisfactorily explain why she denied her being pregnant in the month of <i>Elul</i> of the previous year, or answer all other questions regarding her conduct, she loses her right to her <i>ketubah</i> and is entitled only to whatever is left of the valuables she had brought with her upon her marriage.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 310; Tesh.

A claims that B asked him for permission to remain in T for one year telling him that he had settling rights in another place, thus admitting that he possessed no settling-rights in T. B claims that he does possess such rights in T, that his father lived there before him, and denies having asked B for permission to stay there. Should both, B and A, be permitted to stay in T, it might lead to grave consequences, even to the spilling of blood, since B's conduct is known to be corrupt. Rabbi Moses asked what course he should take with respect to their claims.<br><i>A</i>. If A produces witnesses to the effect that B asked permission to remain in T for a year, B will have to leave the town, since by his asking for permission he admitted that he either possessed no settling rights there, or had foregone any rights he might have had. If A can produce no such witnesses, B has a right to dwell in T. However, because of B's wicked conduct, you, Rabbi Moses, should deprive B of his settling rights in T and require A to pay adequate compensation to B. I have often seen communities deprive one of their members of his settling-rights because of misconduct; your court that has the right to confiscate a person's money, surely has the right to deprive one of his settling-rights. You should force, therefore, A and B to leave the case completely in your hands to be decided either by arbitration or according to strictly legal requirements, and then you will be able to decide as you see fit.<br>R. Meir adds:<br>Your opinion that B lost his settling-rights because of the legal principle \"the law of the land prevails\" is untenable. The ruler of T gave A the authority to pass on new settlers, but he gave A no authority to dislodge old residents. Had the ruler of T granted A the authority even to dislodge old residents, the validity of such a grant would depend on the reasons that prompted the ruler to grant such authority. If A asked the ruler for such authority, then A has no right to exercise his authority since by his request he directly injured B's interests. But, if the ruler of T, on his own accord, said that he does not want any Jew to live in T unless he receive A's permission, then A may dislodge B because of the legal principle: \"The law of the land prevails\".<br>The decision of R. Isaac (b. Samuel, the Tosafist) in the case of the Jews who fled from their town and whose real estate the ruler of the town confiscated and, then, sold to other Jews, has nothing to do with our decision. In this latter case, R. Isaac rightly decided that the purchasers must return the property to the original owners (as compensation, the purchasers were entitled to the amount the original owners would have spent to regain their property) for the ruler had no right to confiscate real property that belonged to the Jews for generations. Such an act on the part of the ruler is not considered \"law of the land\" but is rather outright robbery, and, therefore, illegal. In our case, however, the ruler of T is the owner of T and has a right to admit anyone into his town, and to keep out of it anybody he wants to keep out. We cannot claim for B's benefit that his father bought permanent settling rights from the ruler of T and stipulated that he or his descendants could never be dislodged from T, for such transactions were very rare, even though such a stipulation if made would be binding and would render the act of the ruler dislodging B an illegal act.<br>The decision arrived at in the Talmud (B.B. 54b) accepting as binding the Persian law that if the owner of a field defaults in the taxes for that field, anyone who pays the taxes becomes owner of the field, also, has nothing to do with our case; for taxes on real property accumulate even when the owners are away, while Jews are not required to pay taxes to their overlord, unless they actually live in the domain of these overlords. For Jews are not subjugated to their overlords as the Gentiles are, in the sense that they have to pay taxes to a particular overlord even when they do not live in his domain. The status of the Jew, in this land, is that of a free land owner who lost his land but did not lose his personal liberty. This definition of the status of the Jews is followed by the government in its customary relations with the Jews.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 6; Pr. 101, 1001; L. 313; Mord. B.

B claimed that he gave the money to his daughter while the young couple still lived happily together; that his daughter used the money in business since she was active in business and earned the income for the family, while her husband devoted all his time to studies; that A's son never asked him for the money, and that A never told him not to give the money to his daughter. B also mentioned his daughter's complaints that A's son did unmentionable things to her, conducting himself in a disgusting manner, and thus became hateful to her. She now demanded that he divorce her and pay her the <i>ketubah</i>, as she said that she despised her husband, would never live with him again, and would rather go begging from door to door than remain with him.<br><i>A</i>. B must take an oath to the effect that he gave the money to his daughter while she was still living in peace and harmony with her husband, and thus be free from obligation. Since B's daughter was a rebellious wife she ought to be dealt with as such. I already wrote to you, while I was in Konstanze, my opinion regarding the law governing a rebellious wife. We follow the ordinance of the Geonim and permit her to keep all she brought to her husband as dowry (<i>Nikse Zon Barzel</i>), and whatever he brought is returned to him, nor is she entitled to the <i>Ikkar ketubah</i>; she is then to wait until either he consents to divorce her, or she decides to go back to him. If we suspect, however, that she does not dislike her husband but revolts against him because of financial considerations, or because her father, her mother, or her relatives induce her to quarrel with him, we take away from her even her dowry. In such a case we must follow the law in all its strictness and give all the possessions of the couple to the husband, for the ordinance of the Geonim mentioned above does not apply to the woman who rebels against her husband because she is persuaded to do so by others.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 93, 94; L. 327, 328; Mord.

Having no money to pay for it, he gave B a quantity of gold on condition that should he fail to pay B within three days, B would have the right to raise money against such gold by using it as security on an interest-bearing loan, or by having the money-changers exchange it for money, or by resorting to any other possible manner of raising money. B, however, pledged the gold with C on condition that it become forfeited after two weeks shall have elapsed, should A fail to redeem it within that time. A did not redeem his gold within the stipulated time. Now A demands that B return his gold since he never intended to allow B to pledge his gold on such unusual, and extremely unfavorable, conditions. By the phrase \"any other possible manner\" he meant to permit the employment of customary methods of raising money against security, and no more. Moreover, B did not necessarily have to raise a loan. He could have taken off a piece of the gold commensurate in value with the money due him, and returned the remainder to A; since gold bullion lends itself to such treatment without the necessity of appraisal [by a court]. B, on the other hand, claims that knowing what a dilatory debtor A was, he refused to do business with him until A gave him the gold and specified that it could be used to raise money \"in any possible manner\", the last phrase to be taken literally. He further claims that he could not raise the money in any other way than on the terms made with C, and that he informed A about this transaction with C, and that A agreed to it. A, however, denies B's assertions and claims that he was informed of the transaction with C after he had mounted his horse and had been ready to ride on his way, and that he did not realize at the time the meaning of B's words.<br><i>A</i>.

Eliezer is only a restrictive measure in order to require the taking of <i>Hallah</i> from small pieces of dough (by putting them together in a basket), which are, by themselves, too small to necessitate the taking of <i>Hallah</i> from them.

Part of the money, according to R, belonged to orphans and the other part was deposited with her for the purpose of educating the orphans and contributing to other religious causes with the profit derived therefrom. Subsequently, L paid back to R sixteen <i>marks</i>, gave her a pledge worth ten <i>solidi</i> which a Gentile had deposited with L as security for a loan of one <i>mark</i>, told R that the investments had brought in a profit of fourteen <i>marks</i>, and said that she took for herself seven <i>marks</i> which constituted her part of the profits. Two days later, however, L claimed she had searched her assets and investments carefully and could find no trace of the seven <i>marks</i> profit coming to R, and that she did not know what had become of that money. She demanded that R return her pledges in exchange for the three <i>marks</i> she still owed R on the principal. R said that when L paid her the sixteen <i>marks</i>, the pledges were left in her (R's) possession as security for the four <i>marks</i> of the principal and the seven <i>marks</i> of profit coming to her; that she would not return the pledges until the eleven <i>marks</i> were paid to her; that L had probably spent the seven <i>marks</i> on her sustenance, since she had no money and no source of income; and that she (R) ought not to suffer any loss on the one <i>mark</i> loan made to the Gentile against a pledge worth ten <i>solidi</i>, since she had expressly instructed L to lend the money against adequate security only. L rejoined that R had given her no such instructions; that she knew the Gentile very well, had always trusted him and at one time had lent him ten pounds without security which he had repaid in full; and that when she extended the loan to the Gentile she acted in good faith and was, therefore, not responsible for the loss resulting therefrom. L denied having spent the seven <i>marks</i> on her sustenance, and further denied that her pledges were left in R's possession as security for the seven <i>marks</i> profit, claiming that these pledges were deposited as security for the principal only. The court set up to register the claims [for the purpose of sending it to an authoritative court for decision] thoroughly questioned L regarding the disappearance of half of the fourteen <i>marks</i> she had originally admitted she had earned, but could receive no clear explanation from her. She claimed that whenever she earned a profit of ten or twenty <i>solidi</i> she spent half of it for her daily needs and added the other half to the principal, since such was her understanding with R; that she had thus spent seven <i>marks</i> out of the profit, and that when she finally counted up her assets she could find no trace of the seven <i>marks</i> profit coming to R. She believes that the money was either lost or stolen, or disappeared in some other manner unknown to her.<br><i>A</i>. A person with whom money is deposited for investment purposes and who is to share equally in the profits, assumes the responsibility of a debtor for one half of the money [the profit of which half belongs to him], and the responsibility of a bailee for the other half [the profit of which belongs to the depositor]. If, in addition to the money, the depositor pays a small token fee to the bailee as compensation for his trouble in managing the investments, the latter has the responsibility of a paid bailee for the second half of the deposit; but when no such fee is paid, the responsibility of the bailee thereto is that of a gratuitous bailee. Since L claims to have added the seven <i>marks</i> profit to the principal, her responsibility to this profit became the same as to the principal. Therefore, if R paid L a token fee for her trouble in managing the investments, L was responsible for the loss or theft of the seven <i>marks</i>. Although some authorities would disagree with this decision, we follow the authorities favoring R's interests, since she is in possession of the pledges. But, if R paid L no such fee, the latter will be responsible for only half that amount, upon the taking of an oath to the effect that the seven <i>marks</i> were lost through no negligence on her part, and that she did not misappropriate them. However, should R claim that according to her agreement with L the profit was not to be joined to the principal and that it was to be given to her immediately, or that it was left with L as a loan and not for reinvestment, R will be entitled to collect the entire seven <i>marks</i> upon the taking of an oath to the truth of such claim. We must be satisfied with such oath, since she is in possession of the pledges. Regarding the loan to the Gentile against inadequate security, R may take an oath to the effect that she had specifically instructed L not to lend the money unless adequately secured, and be entitled to collect the one <i>mark</i>; or she may demand that L take an oath as to the truth of her (L's) claim.<br>This Responsum is addressed to R.

A's father, B (Moses), representing his son, brought forth the following claims: a) When he (B) had arranged the match with L's father, C (Judah), he had promised C to send his son to live in C's house; b) he kept his promise, and, after A betrothed L through a messenger, he sent A to C; c) at the time the match was arranged C promised to clothe A suitably, to support him, and to hire a capable teacher for him; d) after A stayed in C's house for one year, he was sent back to his father and C took no further notice of him; A was forced to interrupt his studies and he, B, with very limited means, had to support him for five difficult years; and, f) he asked many persons to urge C to keep his promise of support to A, but C refused. The undersigned (R. Meir) also, sent many letters to C, asking him to have pity on his son-in-law who suffered poverty and privation — all to no avail. Moreover, we have learned (from a letter) that C does not at all desire the consummation of the marriage, but has set his heart on a divorce since A displeased him. Thus, B claims that he has fulfilled his promise and sent his son to C; but, that the latter put A to shame and now he, B, can no longer force A to return to C's house; that A is afraid to return to C's place of residence since many persons have warned him that C's servants were threatening to do him injury unless he agree to divorce L; that though A cannot, and will not, return to C, he is nevertheless ready to marry L whenever she will come to his place of residence.<br>Taking the above into consideration, we have decided that A cannot be compelled to settle in C's town, marry L, and live with her there; nor can he be forced to divorce L. Our decision is based on irrefutable proof: Thus, the majority of our leading authorities agree that a man living in one country who betrothed a woman living in another country, may force the woman to come and live with him in his country. Although the Tosephta (Ket. 13, 2) and the Palestinian Talmud, (Ket. 13, 10) seem to disagree on this score, we believe that our interpretation of the statements in these two sources removes the discrepancy and shows that both agree regarding this law. Moreover, when the man betrothed the woman through a messenger, there is not a shadow of a doubt that according to both sources given above, the woman ought to be forced to move to her husband's place of residence. This opinion is shared by Rashi, Maimonides and other leading authorities. R. Tam, however, believes that these sources deal with cases in which we force the husband to change his place of residence to that of his wife. Therefore, in view of this difference of opinion (although I do not agree with the view of R. Tam) we must accept the strictures of each opinion. Thus, we are forced to decide that neither the husband nor the wife can force a change in the other's place of residence. We cannot compel the husband to change his place of residence because of the opinion of Rashi, Maimonides, and the other leading authorities; but neither can we compel the wife to change her place of residence, because of the opinion of R. Tam. Although B had agreed at the time of the betrothal that A would settle in C's town, B had no right to bind A to such terms and we can find no evidence that A had voluntarily agreed to change his place of residence. The fact that A went to visit C is no evidence of such voluntary agreement. Moreover, he went on this visit after the betrothal, while we are concerned with his intentions at the time of the betrothal. Therefore, this agreement between B and C is void. Furthermore, had A himself voluntarily agreed at the time of the betrothal to move to C's place of residence, we should not be able to force A to keep his part of the agreement since C, on his part, had made many promises at that time which he later failed to keep.<br>Some Rabbis wrote their opinion that A should be compelled to move to L's place of residence since it was not dignified for a woman to move from place to place, as expressed by the verse: \"All glorious is the king's daughter within the palace\" (Ps. 45,11; cf. Git. 12a). Moreover, it is humiliating for a woman to pursue her husband into a distant place. However, I regard this manner of reasoning as very strange indeed; for in the talmudic period women were more honorable and discreet than today, and yet talmudic law required them to move to their husband's place of residence. The aforementioned Rabbis also wrote that since, according to the Talmud, a woman's station may be elevated through marriage but not lowered, L should not be forced to move to A's town. For L was brought up in great luxury and abundance, and were she to move to A's house she would have to share his poverty and privation. However, L would not have to suffer privation. C had promised A a large sum of money as a dowry; with that money A should be able to support L in a manner befitting her station, and on a standard equal to that of the other women of her family. Although she would miss some of the extravagances of her father's house, she would have to bear with such minor inconvenience. In conclusion, since A is ready to marry L whenever she will come to live in his town, we cannot compel A to move to L's town or to divorce her. This decision is required by talmudic law and the Rabbis made no distinction between a poor woman and a rich woman. Signed: R. Meir b. Baruch.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 386; Tesh. Maim. to <i>Nashim</i>, 28; Hayyim Or Zarua, <i>Responsa</i> 147. Cf. <i>Hagahot Asheri</i> Ket. 12, 3; Asheri Ket. 13, 17; <i>Tur Eben Haezer</i> 75.<br>The following Responsa by R. Samuel b. Salomo, R. Jacob B. Joseph, R. Yehiel b. Jacob ha Levi, and R. Eliezer B. Ephraim, refer to the same case:<br>This letter is written regarding the youth of Rothenburg who betrothed, through a messenger, the daughter of R. Judah of Düren. At the time the match was concluded the youth's father had agreed that his son would take up his permanent abode with his father-in-law. After the betrothal the bridegroom came to stay with R. Judah who hired a teacher for him and treated him honorably for a long time. A year later the youth became sick and R. Judah, thinking that this was a result of the change of climate, sent him home accompanied by his teacher, and expended large sums of money on him. Subsequently, R. Judah sent for the youth to come to his house and marry his daughter. The youth, however, changed his mind on the matter of residence, and refused to come to Düren, stating however that he was ready to marry his bride if and when she came to live in Rothenburg. Thus it is apparent that the youth was intending to exact money from R. Judah. Therefore, it is my opinion that the youth be forced either to marry his bride on her terms, or divorce her. First, it is obvious that at the time of her betrothal the bridegroom had intended to settle in Düren. Secondly, his father had explicitly agreed with R. Judah to the youth's change of abode. Therefore, we assume that the youth also had agreed to it, since a young son does not dare to oppose his father and usually subscribes to the father's arrangement of his affairs. Again in agreements arising between the various parties interested in a marriage, the conditions apparently implied, though not expressly stated, are presumed to form part of such agreements (see Git. 65b; Ket. 54b; 79a; B. B. 132a). Thus, in our case, it is apparent that R. Judah did not intend to have his daughter leave him and her mother and remove from the country of her birth, and suffer privation in Rothenburg with her poverty stricken husband; that he did not intend to spend the large sum of money required to finance the safe conduct of one who was the daughter of a magnate whose name was known throughout the countries. Thus, the overlord of Rothenburg acting on the mere rumor [that R. Judah's daughter was coming to settle in Rothenburg] already sought ways of subjugating R. Judah to his will [using his daughter as a hostage]. Finally, according to the Talmud (Ket. 110b) a husband cannot force his wife to move from a humble to a more sumptuous dwelling since she can hold that such change of abode, even though it was for the better, would cause her many inconveniences. Any woman who gives plausible reasons against the change of abode demanded by her husband, therefore, cannot be forced to undertake such a change. In our case the bride's reasons against a change of abode are numerous and reasonable. Therefore, the youth ought to be forced by flagellation or the use of the ban either to marry his bride or to divorce her. This case was already brought before us last year, and we decided in the bride's favor. Because of these reasons, I have agreed to ban and chastise the bridegroom until he either marry his bride on her terms or divorce her. If he refuses to comply with our order he shall bear his sin and those who support him shall likewise suffer. None is excluded from our ban, excepting, of course, our honored teacher Rabbi Meir. Rabbenu Gershom requires that a husband be coerced into divorcing his rebellious wife lest the latter turn to mischief. Although many authorities disagree with Rabbenu Gershom and we do not follow his decision, in cases similar to the one at hand, however, we must protect the daughters of Israel lest unscrupulous youths use the inability and unwillingness of daughters of rich men to change their place of residence, as a means of extorting money from their fathers. Signed: Samuel b. Salomo (Pr. 250).<br>Wailing and complaint that cannot be silenced, arose because of Jacob b. Moses who betrothed the daughter of R. Judah…. The bridegroom may be coerced either to marry the bride on her terms or divorce her. R. Tam decided that a court must compel a levir to marry, or give <i>halitzah</i> to his brother's childless widow, even by the use of force; and that it is even permissible to have Gentiles use force on the levir until he comply with the decision of the Jewish court. Although according to the Jerusalem Talmud whenever the Mishna fails expressly to allow the use of coercion we can use no physical compulsion (Ket. 11, 7), and although the ban is a strong form of coercion, nevertheless, since R. Tam allowed the use of physical compulsion (in a case where the Mishna does not expressly allow the use of such measures, cf. B. Yeb. 39a) we ought to ban the bridegroom until he comply with our decision. Moreover, custom changes law; whenever we are uncertain regarding a certain law, we observe and follow the accepted practice. Thus, the custom is universally accepted of performing the marriage ceremony in the house of the bride's father. Therefore, we invoked against the youth all the curses great and small, until he comply with our decision. Signed Jacob b. Rabbi Joseph (Pr. 251).<br>To our Rabbis of Germany, your love has obliged me to express my opinion regarding the above. Since witnesses testify to the fact that there was a stipulated condition at the time of the betrothal, such condition is binding and the bridegroom must live up to its terms. Even if there are no such witnesses, the fact that his father-in-law kept him in his house together with his teacher, even though he returned home because of illness, proves that the father-in-law intended that the wedding take place in his house. It is difficult to imagine that the latter intended to brave the grave danger of sending his daughter and his money to Germany, which is very unsafe country. Furthermore, a man may not force his wife to leave her country and to come to live in his country. Therefore, we may force the bridegroom to do one of two things: either marry his bride and come to live in her place of residence, or divorce her. The Rabbis ought to coerce him by the use of chastisement and the ban, for fear lest his bride remain a deserted wife. We find many instances where the Rabbis decreed special laws and took extraordinary measures in order to prevent the possibility of a woman remaining a deserted wife. Signed: Yehiel b. Jacob ha Levi (Pr. 251).<br>To my teacher Rabbi Meir. I saw the decision of the judges in the case of the honorable R. Judah of Düren who betrothed his daughter to Jacob b. Moses of Rothenburg. At the time of the betrothal Moses agreed to send his son Jacob to Düren in order that he marry his bride there. Moses kept his agreement and sent his son to R. Judah. But, when the latter saw that Jacob was small in stature, homely, and despicable, he had pity on his daughter. Fearing lest she begin to despise her bridegroom, he sent Jacob back to his father to stay there till he grow up. When the bride grew up and R. Judah was told that Jacob also gained in strength, he sent for the latter to come and marry his bride. However, Moses refused to send Jacob to Düren. As time dragged on and R. Judah's daughter saw that her bridegroom refused to come to her, she sent a messenger to Rothenburg to demand that Jacob either marry her on the conditions previously agreed upon, or divorce her. But Jacob answered that he did not personally agree to move to Düren, that he did not join in his father's agreement on that score, that he would not come to her father's house, and that he would marry her only if she come to Rothenburg. Thereupon it was decided [by R. Meir] that she could not compel Jacob to move to Düren nor force him to divorce her. This decision, however, is very strange, and, in my opinion, is a perversion of justice for a number of reasons. a) Some of our great authorities quote the opinion of R. Tam to the effect that both the Mishna (Ket. 13, 10) and the Tosephta (Ket. 13, 2) which treat of the conditions under which a party to a marriage may be forced to remove to the place of residence of the other party, deal with forcing the husband to move to the place of residence of the wife. Therefore, the conclusion of both sources is that the husband who married a wife living in another country must move to that country. Again, whenever the talmudic sources state that the husband be so forced to move, the implication is that upon refusing to do so he must divorce his wife and pay her the <i>ketubah</i>. Next, it is well known that the bride's home is luxurious and comfortable [for which reason she ought not to be forced to remove to her husband's humble abode], that her traveling to Rothenburg would entail great difficulties and serious hazards since the entire road is infested with lurking dangers, and that her very stay in Rothenburg would be perilous because of her father's great reputation for wealth. Therefore, Jacob cannot force her to take such a step. Besides, even if she wanted to go to Rothenburg, her father's repeated objections would not allow her to do so, and she could do nothing about it. Therefore, this case is similar to the one quoted in the Mishna (Ket. 13, 5), in which case Admon decided that the bride might demand from her bridegroom that he either marry, or divorce her. Finally, Jacob is bound by his father's agreement, since it is customary for the parents of a couple to enter into all agreements governing the marriage, and for such agreements to be considered binding on the couple. Although the principle is accepted that \"the consent of the father does not imply the consent of the son (Kid. 45b)\", this principle applies only to the actual betrothal but not to the other arrangements appertaining thereto. Moreover, the fact that he came to live in Düren proves that he had agreed to his father's arrangement; while his having been sent home temporarily, because of illness, did not invalidate the original agreement.<br>Therefore, it seems to me that the decision cited above was a perversion of justice, or, at least, against common sense, and not in the interest of the public welfare. For were we to accept the principle implied in your decision, the interests of the wealthy would suffer greatly. Thus many unscrupulous persons, knowing that the daughters of the rich cannot move away from their home towns, would betroth such women and then extort money from their fathers by refusing to marry them until either the women move away from their homeland, or their fathers pay exorbitant sums of money. And you, my teacher, R. Meir, how did you come to subscribe to such a decision? Everybody is wondering at this. For R. Judah is ready to fulfill all his previous promises and more; he wants Jacob and the bride also wants him. They are ready to give guarantees that they will not act treacherously against him; and, in case he does not want her, she is ready to accept her divorce and forego her <i>ketubah</i>. In the face of such facts, how can any Rabbi, student, or judge, give heed to those who insidiously demand that R. Judah's daughter come to live in Rothenburg, knowing full well that she can not do so! It is obvious that these persons are only interested in extorting money from R. Judah, and it is not becoming your dignity to uphold the cause of these extortionists. Should we allow an Israelite daughter to become a deserted wife because her father is averse to becoming a victim of extortion? I know that R. Judah did not acquiesce; that he could not bear the idea of being coerced and forced to part with his money; and that he sent inquiries to the elders, the greatest authorities of France, and to other places. It appears that those authorities have all agreed that Jacob ought to be forced to marry his bride on her own terms or to divorce her. Although you are the greatest authority of our generation, you will not find it easy to oppose the decision of our great authorities, lest dissensions multiply in Israel. \"Therefore, leave off contention, before the quarrel break out\" (Proverbs 17,14).

                "<i>Q</i>. A's wife bound herself by a ban in the presence of the people of the town, not to do a certain thing. The terms of the ban were written down, and all the townfolk signed the document. Subsequently she transgressed the ban several times, as attested to by witnesses. A transgressing woman, if properly forwarned, loses the right to her <i>ketubah</i>. We are doubtful, however, whether A's wife had to be properly forewarned before losing her right to the <i>ketubah</i>. We are inclined to believe that no such forewarning was necessary since she was warned at the time the ban was pronounced that she would lose the right to her <i>ketubah</i> should she transgress the ban, and she agreed thereto without inserting any qualifying conditions. Does A's wife lose the right to her <i>ketubah?</i> Furthermore, is A permitted to divorce her against her will?<br><i>A</i>. Even if proper forewarning were required before a transgressing woman loses her right to the <i>ketubah</i>, one such warning would be sufficient. Otherwise a woman would be able, without any restraint, continually to cause her husband to sin. For, when forewarned by witnesses, she would temporarily abstain from sin, and, later, return to her mischief. Moreover, any situation that would require the administration of testing-water to a <i>Sotah</i> (a woman suspected of faithlessness), would cause her to lose the right to her <i>ketubah;</i> and the forewarning of a jealous husband, even though preceding by many days the seclusion of his wife with another man, would require the administration of testing-water, as evidenced by the statement of the Baraita (Yeb. 58b): the jealous forewarning of a betrothed would require the administration of testing-water after she married [if she secluded herself with that other man after the marriage took place]. Therefore, a forewarning does not necessarily have to precede a transgression immediately.<br>The question was again sent to R. Meir: A's wife brought witnesses who testified before us that A also had transgressed the ban. We decided, therefore, that she did not lose the right to her <i>ketubah</i>, since she did not intend to commit a sin. Moreover, a woman must be forewarned immediately before committing a sin in order to be classified as a transgressing woman. The Baraita cited above offers no proof to the contrary since it deals with a case where the sinful seclusion immediately followed the jealous forewarning (i. e. the seclusion took place before the marriage).<br><i>A</i>. I still believe that a forewarning does not necessarily have to precede the transgression immediately. Thus Rashi offers two interpretations of the aforementioned Baraita. The first, and most important, interpretation assumes that the seclusion took place after the marriage, and, thus, long after the jealous forewarning. Moreover, the Talmud (Sotah 26a) clearly states that a woman who was jealously forewarned before her marriage and secluded herself with another man after the marriage, must either drink the testing-water or lose the right to her <i>ketubah</i>. However, since A too has transgressed the ban, we must make two distinctions. a) If the wife's sin consisted of merely disregarding the ban, while her act was not sinful in itself, A is not permitted to divorce her; for transgressing a ban causes the death of the transgressor's children, and is, therefore, ground for divorce; but, since A himself transgressed the ban, he can have no objection to a similar act on the part of his wife. b) If A's wife, however, transgressed Mosaic law and Jewish custom, A is permitted to divorce her even against her will; he need not seek the consent of the communities, and he is not required to pay her the <i>ketubah</i>.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 185; L. 393; Tesh.

                "<i>Q</i>. A borrowed ten pounds of charity-money on the following conditions: a) that he pay three pounds per year out of his profits; b) that should his profit be less than three pounds, he would have to pay only half of that profit; and c) in case there be a loss, A would suffer the entire loss himself. For ten years A paid the three pounds per year regularly and thus has paid thirty pounds to the charity-chest. Now, however, being somewhat depleted in finances he is in no position to return the ten pounds. Since it is forbidden to lend charity-money on condition that the lender share in the profits but not in the losses, the thirty pounds paid by A is considered <i>abak ribbit</i> (shade of usury). Although A can not collect, by judicial process, the <i>abak ribbit</i> he has paid, he ought to be able to retain the ten pounds in exchange for the unlawful interest he has paid. Signed: Hayyim b. Machir.<br><i>A</i>. If one lends money on condition that he share in the profits but not in the losses, the terms of this transaction, being unlawful, are void. We must, therefore, substitute other terms in their place. We must choose one of the following alternatives: a) the transaction is a pure loan bearing no profit; b) the lender is liable for his share of the losses and is entitled to his share of the profits. Since a person lends money with the intention of earning a profit, and such profit constitutes the main purpose of the transaction, we prefer the second alternative. Therefore, we must calculate what percentage of the entire profit (earned by A through the use of the ten pounds) the three pounds per year was expected to form, and, then, charge the charity-chest with the responsibility for the same percentage of the losses. If, during the ten year period, the thirty pounds paid by A exceeded the percentage of the total profit, A is entitled to deduct such excess from the principal; otherwise, he must repay the entire principal.<br>R. Hayyim b. Machir raised objections to R. Meir's decision. He brought proof to the effect that the transaction ought to be changed into a pure loan bearing no profit, and that A be entitled to retain the ten pounds of the principal against the illegal profit he has paid. He even cited (by number) another Responsum of R. Meir wherein the latter decided that a transaction such as the above be considered a pure loan bearing no profit. (Cf. Cr. 62, Pr. 151; Am. II, 169.) He assured Rabbi Meir, however, that he would follow his decision.<br>R. Meir replied: I was always of the opinion that the aforesaid transaction ought to be considered a pure loan bearing no profit. But, when your query reached me I had just received the book (Code) of Maimomides, and I decided to \"ask the Oracle\" (see what Maimonides says on the subject). When I discovered that Maimonides requires the lender to share in the losses as well as in the profits, I adopted his view. For all his words are based on tradition. Even if this decision be based on reason, I have to bow to his opinion since my inferior reasoning ability could never compare with that of Maimonides who is a profound master in that art. Moreover, I see the wisdom of his view. For a person who lends money to another does so because he hopes to profit thereby. Were he mainly interested in the safety of the principal (as you seem to infer) he would keep the money in a safe place and never lend it to anybody. Were we to ask a lender who had stipulated that he do not share in the losses, whether he would prefer to change his voided agreement into a pure loan transaction bearing no profit, or choose to share in the profits and the losses, he would certainly prefer the latter. Furthermore, when the active partner lends the money against adequate security, the chances of earning a profit are much greater than the chances of losing part of the principal.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 426; P. 477."

They then removed to a different locality where the <i>ketubah</i> is valued at much less. They lived in the latter place until A's death. How much money is L entitled to as her <i>ketubah</i>?<br><i>A</i>. The opinion of R. Simon b. Gamaliel (Ket. 110b) is accepted that a woman is entitled to the <i>ketubah</i> current in the locality where her marriage took place.<br>b) <i>Q</i>. After A died L took over, and managed, his estate. Why, then, did you write that the estate was considered, nevertheless, to be in the possession of the orphans?<br><i>A</i>. R. Hananel decided that the estate managed by the widow is considered to be in the possession of the orphans. The widow is merely a managing trustee. Therefore, all the profit accruing because of her management, belongs to the orphans and she can not collect her <i>ketubah</i> therefrom. When the widow demands her <i>ketubah</i> she loses her right to receive her sustenance from the estate. She must, then, take an oath while holding the Scroll of the Law; and whatever she thus states under oath to have given away, or to have retained for herself, to have given to her daughter, or to have given to charity, is deducted from her <i>ketubah</i>.<br>c) <i>Q</i>. L lent some of the money to lords and \"men of violence\", and it is doubtful whether the latter will pay their debts.<br><i>A</i>. L is responsible for these bad investments. Ordinarily when heirs pay the <i>ketubah</i> to a widow, they may give her in payment any kind of property, or any object even bran; but they cannot pay her by transferring to her money due them from others, since the collection of debts often involves litigations to which a woman is not accustomed. However, in our case, the orphans may transfer to L the money she has invested with the lords and the \"men of violence\", in payment of her <i>ketubah</i>, since she had no right to make such unsafe investments.<br>d) <i>Q</i>. While L managed the estate she gave presents to certain persons thinking she had the right to do so. Are the orphans entitled to take back the presents?<br><i>A</i>. The recipients are entitled to retain these presents since they may claim that L gave them out of her own property, and since it appears that the market ordinance (<i>takkanat hashuk</i>) was to apply to property given away as presents.<br>e) <i>Q</i>. Do we put forth the claim for the benefit of the orphans that L may have been a widow when she married A, or that A may have paid her one <i>Mina</i>.?<br><i>A</i>. We surely put forth the above claims for the benefit of the orphans. However, if a report circulates that L was a virgin when she married A, she is entitled to the <i>ketubah</i> of a virgin, since the majority of women are married while virgins. [The principle of \"a majority of cases\" presumes that what is true in most instances, is also true in our case.] Although in litigation over money matters the principle of \"a majority of cases\" is not a factor, it is so when the claimant is in actual possession of the litigated money. In our case, L is in actual possession of the money; therefore, the combination of a \"majority\" and a \"report\" in her favor, is conclusive.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 127–8–9–30–31; L. 480–1–2–3."

Opinions differ on this subject and I should not dare to decide between the authorities. However, we always follow the decisions of Alfasi whenever they are not contradicted by the Tosaphists. In this case the Tosaphists specifically agree with Alfasi that the custom of the Galileans was to be followed. The fact that two or three members of your community found it necessary to insert, in the <i>ketubot</i> they gave to their wives, the clause: \"after my death, should you desire to remain a widow the rest of your life you may take possession of all my property\" does not prove that your community has adopted the Judean custom. These individuals may have merely reiterated the accepted custom for the sake of emphasis. Moreover, this clause is not entirely superflous even in a community where the Galilean custom prevails; for it strengthens the widow's position inasmuch as it makes her master of the estate, while according to the Galilean custom she is only to receive thirty-day allowances at a time. Neither does the fact that some widows in your community have been ousted from their husbands' estates by being paid their <i>ketubah</i>, prove that you have adopted the Judean custom. Mere ignorance of their rights may have been the only reason these widows did not protest against such an ouster.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: P. 281; Am. II, 4; Mord. Ket. 170. Cf.

                    "<i>Q</i>. I heard that you permit the lending of charity-funds on condition that the lender share in the profits, but not in the losses, resulting from its investment by the borrower. Such a transaction is forbidden by Rabbinical decree; why, then, should it be permitted in connection with charity-funds? Signed: Hayyim b. Machir.<br><i>A</i>. Lending charity-funds on condition that the lender share in the profits but not in the losses, is forbidden. The Rabbis who said (B. M. 70a) that a person lending money on such a condition is called \"wicked\" made no distinction between rich and poor. Since a poor person is not permitted to lend his money on condition that he share in the profits but not in the losses, we are not permitted to do so for him.<br>Note: The following introduction precedes the answer: Please excuse me for the brief response. For the last two weeks I have been confined to bed and have lost the taste for food. I wrote to you a lengthy response regarding the lending of charity-funds, and sent it to you through a messenger named Marvel. I forgot the lengthy argument and discussion.

                    "<i>Q</i>. A borrowed ten pounds of charity-money on the following conditions: a) that he pay three pounds per year out of his profits; b) that should his profit be less than three pounds, he would have to pay only half of that profit; and c) in case there be a loss, A would suffer the entire loss himself. For ten years A paid the three pounds per year regularly and thus has paid thirty pounds to the charity-chest. Now, however, being somewhat depleted in finances he is in no position to return the ten pounds. Since it is forbidden to lend charity-money on condition that the lender share in the profits but not in the losses, the thirty pounds paid by A is considered <i>abak ribbit</i> (shade of usury). Although A can not collect, by judicial process, the <i>abak ribbit</i> he has paid, he ought to be able to retain the ten pounds in exchange for the unlawful interest he has paid. Signed: Hayyim b. Machir.<br><i>A</i>. If one lends money on condition that he share in the profits but not in the losses, the terms of this transaction, being unlawful, are void. We must, therefore, substitute other terms in their place. We must choose one of the following alternatives: a) the transaction is a pure loan bearing no profit; b) the lender is liable for his share of the losses and is entitled to his share of the profits. Since a person lends money with the intention of earning a profit, and such profit constitutes the main purpose of the transaction, we prefer the second alternative. Therefore, we must calculate what percentage of the entire profit (earned by A through the use of the ten pounds) the three pounds per year was expected to form, and, then, charge the charity-chest with the responsibility for the same percentage of the losses. If, during the ten year period, the thirty pounds paid by A exceeded the percentage of the total profit, A is entitled to deduct such excess from the principal; otherwise, he must repay the entire principal.<br>R. Hayyim b. Machir raised objections to R. Meir's decision. He brought proof to the effect that the transaction ought to be changed into a pure loan bearing no profit, and that A be entitled to retain the ten pounds of the principal against the illegal profit he has paid. He even cited (by number) another Responsum of R. Meir wherein the latter decided that a transaction such as the above be considered a pure loan bearing no profit. (Cf. Cr. 62, Pr. 151; Am. II, 169.) He assured Rabbi Meir, however, that he would follow his decision.<br>R. Meir replied: I was always of the opinion that the aforesaid transaction ought to be considered a pure loan bearing no profit. But, when your query reached me I had just received the book (Code) of Maimomides, and I decided to \"ask the Oracle\" (see what Maimonides says on the subject). When I discovered that Maimonides requires the lender to share in the losses as well as in the profits, I adopted his view. For all his words are based on tradition. Even if this decision be based on reason, I have to bow to his opinion since my inferior reasoning ability could never compare with that of Maimonides who is a profound master in that art. Moreover, I see the wisdom of his view. For a person who lends money to another does so because he hopes to profit thereby. Were he mainly interested in the safety of the principal (as you seem to infer) he would keep the money in a safe place and never lend it to anybody. Were we to ask a lender who had stipulated that he do not share in the losses, whether he would prefer to change his voided agreement into a pure loan transaction bearing no profit, or choose to share in the profits and the losses, he would certainly prefer the latter. Furthermore, when the active partner lends the money against adequate security, the chances of earning a profit are much greater than the chances of losing part of the principal.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 426; P. 477."

                    "Nowadays the talmudic law regarding a rebellious wife no longer applies. The ordinance of the Saboraim prevails instead, that when a woman refuses to live with her husband, he is immediately to be coerced into granting her a divorce. This ordinance was instituted in order that Jewish women should not turn to mischief. The woman is to receive whatever she has brought in as her dowry (<i>Nikse Zon Barzel</i>), and whatever is left of her own property to which her husband had the right of usufruct (<i>Nikse Melug</i>). The Geonim ruled that she was also entitled to the <i>Ikkar ketubah</i>. The husband is to be coerced, by threat of excommunication, into granting the divorce, for who will dare contradict the decisions of the great luminary Rabbenu Gershom, the Geonim, Alfasi, Maimonides, and R. Isaac di Trani? One may not object that such favorable treatment would encourage many women to rebel against their husbands; Heaven forfend, Jewish daughters are not suspected of such malefaction. They prefer to stay married even in adverse circumstances, and would not seek a divorce unless actually driven thereto.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: B. p. 285, nos. 337–9; P. 494. Cf.

This talmudic interpretation implies, that only objects possessing both characteristics: a) items usually sold by the piece, and b) forbidden objects, the profitable use of which is prohibited (<i>issurei hanaah</i>), are never neutralized in a mixture. However, objects lacking one of these characteristics do become neutralized in the proper mixture.<br>R. Meir took issue with R.

On the contrary, these authorities decide that items usually sold by the piece, even though they be not forbidden objects the profitable use of which is prohibited, are never neutralized. Moreover, R.

These individuals may have merely reiterated the accepted custom for the sake of emphasis. Moreover, this clause is not entirely superflous even in a community where the Galilean custom prevails; for it strengthens the widow's position inasmuch as it makes her master of the estate, while according to the Galilean custom she is only to receive thirty-day allowances at a time. Neither does the fact that some widows in your community have been ousted from their husbands' estates by being paid their <i>ketubah</i>, prove that you have adopted the Judean custom.

When she married A she was not considered very rich and no one suspected that she owned more than the value of her <i>ketubah</i>. But, after her death, when A declared, under oath, to the community (leaders, probably for purposes of taxation) the value of his assets, it was discovered that he had inherited from B more than the value of her <i>ketubah</i> from her former husband. The heirs of the latter, therefore, demand that A return the excess to them.<br><i>A</i>. If the valuables B brought to A were undistinguishable and no one recognized them as having belonged to B's former husband, A is free from obligation for five reasons. a) Even if the valuables B brought to A were worth more than the value of her <i>ketubah</i>, such valuables may not all necessarily have come from the estate of her former husband, for she might have received some gifts or found a treasure. b) Were B still alive she would have been obliged to take an oath [to the effect that she did not take from her former husband more than the value of her <i>ketubah</i>], but now that she is dead, A is free from the obligation of taking an oath, since he is not supposed to know his wife's affairs. c) A is not even required to take the oath of an heir — that B never told him, and that he did not know that she had received from the estate of her former husband more than the value of her <i>ketubah</i> — since the heirs of B's former husband are not positive in their claim. The heirs, however, may pronounce the ban (<i>herem</i>) in the synagogue against anyone who does possess such knowledge and does not reveal it. Such ban would include A. d) Whatever a person would have retained, had he taken an oath, his heirs may retain without the necessity of taking an oath. e) Some authorities require A to take the oath of an heir; but since many great authorities absolve him from such oath, and since A is in possession of the aforesaid valuables, the burden of proof is upon the plaintiff. For similar reasons A would be free from the obligation of taking an oath, even if some of the valuables brought to him by B were distinguishable and were recognized as having belonged to B's former husband, if the valuables thus recognized were in themselves not worth more than the value of B's <i>ketubah</i>. But, if the distinguishable valuables are in themselves worth more than the value of B's <i>ketubah</i>, A must return the difference to the heirs of B's first husband.<br><i>Q</i>.

When L proved a very inefficient, careless, and wasteful trustee, A's sons reached an agreement with L, whereby she was to receive forty <i>marks</i> for turning over the estate to A's sons immediately. Before relinquishing her trusteeship, L and her youngest son B (who was eighteen years of age) agreed to allow R's husband to take his wife's share of the estate immediately, without having to wait for L's death. A's two other sons object to this latter agreement.<br><i>A</i>. A's heirs were entitled to take over his estate at any time they wished to do so. The giving of forty <i>marks</i> to L in order that she relinquish her trusteeship, was entirely unnecessary, for A's document, while making the collection of R's share in A's estate dependant on L's death, did not appoint L trustee of said estate. Moreover, had A explicitly appointed L trustee of his estate, the court would have removed her at no expense to the heirs, since she had proven to be inefficient, careless, and wasteful. The second agreement is not binding on A's two sons since L, not being a trustee of the estate, had no legal power to dispose of part of the estate. B, however, was able to forego his own part of R's share, and his act is binding upon such part if R (or her husband) was in possession of her share at the time of the latter agreement. Thus R would be entitled to receive one third of her share (B's part of her share) immediately, while B's two brothers would manage the other two-thirds for their own profit and gain until L's death.<br>Although the brothers are entitled to manage R's share for their own profit, they are not permitted to sell or otherwise alienate any part of it; and their responsibility thereto would be that of a gratuitous watchman. Thus any increase that will accrue until L's death will belong to the brothers, while, any decrease of value caused by theft, loss or unavoidable accident will be suffered by R. Should the brothers be called upon to pay L her <i>ketubah</i>, one quarter of such payment should come out of R's share.

                        "<i>Q</i>. A paid his taxes directly to the overlord of his town, independently of the rest of the community. The overlord, suspecting that A possessed much greater wealth than he usually professed to have, and being driven by a greed for money, arrested him without cause and later arrested his wife L. Before her arrest, however, and before the reason for these arrests became manifest, L helped Gershom, A's son by a previous marriage, to flee the domain of the overlord and thus escape from his clutches. Meanwhile, A was put to death in prison. The overlord posted guards in the town to make sure that A's children did not escape, and demanded a large sum of money from L. He further proposed that L merge her taxes with those of the community and that the latter jointly with L negotiate the new tax. When the community representatives asked as to the identity of the persons who would be expected to pay this tax, the overlord answered that everybody would pay it, the young and the old, the rich and the poor. The community representatives, then, strongly objected to the merger with L; whereupon the overlord agreed to negotiate with them separately. He levied a very heavy tax on the community, but this tax did not exceed the estimated value of the wealth of the community members. L was warned that should she prove to be stubborn and unyielding, she and A's children would be made to suffer the same fate as A. Finally the overlord came to terms with L and agreed to release her, and to return to her A's impounded valuables, for a ransom of six hundred and twenty pounds. To insure the payment of this ransom the overlord demanded as hostages one of L's children and one of A's children by his former marriage. Now Gershom, and A's other children by his former marriage, refuse to pay their part of the ransom money, and instead, wish to pay their part of the assessment on the community.<br><i>A</i>. Gershom is not obliged to pay any part of the ransom money since he escaped before the overlord asked for such money. Although L engineered his escape, he is under no monetary obligation to her, since she merely did him a favor. However, if Gershom is to claim, as his share of the inheritance, part of A's valuables that have remained in town within the grasp of the overlord, he must pay a proportionate part of the ransom for such valuables. A's children by his former marriage must pay their part of the ransom money in proportion to their wealth. Even though they were not imprisoned, there is sufficient indication that the overlord intended to include them in the extortion. Thus, guards had been posted in town to watch them, and their lives had been explicitly threatened upon L's refusal to come to terms with the overlord. Moreover, had the overlord negotiated with L regarding only her personal possessions, he would not have demanded 620 pounds from her, knowing full well that she was entitled to receive from A's estate only her <i>ketubah</i>, and that such a sum was well beyond her means. The overlord did not demand from the community a sum greater than the value of all their wealth; therefore, it stands to reason that he was not entirely unreasonable in his demands upon L. We may assume with certainty that had L refused to pay the ransom, A's children would have been seized, and would have been killed or forcibly baptized. Had A's children protested against being ransomed, we would have paid no attention to them and would have effected their release even against their will, and then, we would have collected the ransom money from them; for we are obliged to ransom a Jew even against his will. Now, that A's children have not protested against the ransom, they must certainly contribute thereto in proportion to their wealth. Although their lives were threatened, and the talmudic law (B.B. 116b) would thus require that the amount of the ransom money should be calculated, one half equally for each person, and the other half in proportion to the individual's wealth, this law does not apply to our case. We know that the overlord was interested only in their money, not in taking their lives, as the whole trouble started because the overlord thought A to be very wealthy.<br><i>Q</i>. L seized some of A's movables claiming that she seized them for the purpose of paying for her sustenance. Some of these movables were originally impounded by the overlord and were later returned to L. May A's heirs force L to render under oath an account of such valuables?<br><i>A</i>. Movables impounded by an overlord are considered abandoned property (<i>hefker</i>), title thereto, passing to the first person who seizes them, since the original owner must have given up hope of retrieving them. Although owners do not usually abandon movables taken away by Gentile robbers (B.K. 114a), they do abandon these when impounded by the overlord of the town, since he is the undisputed master of the town and no one can restrain him. This was especially true in our case, since his claim was bolstered by false accusations. Therefore, L is under no obligation to give an account of the movables returned to her by the overlord. However, those movables which the overlord had returned to her, and which she gave to the overlord in partial payment of the ransom, should be credited <i>pro rata</i> to all those who are obliged to pay the ransom, since the valuables had been given to her in order to decrease the ransom for all parties involved. Furthermore, L is under no obligation to give an accounting of the other movables she seized (the movables that were not impounded by the overlord) as long as it is known that the value of such movables does not exceed the value of her <i>ketubah</i>. For whenever L demands her <i>ketubah</i>, she will have to take an oath regarding these movables; as long as she does not demand her <i>ketubah</i>, no oath can be imposed on her.<br><i>Q</i>. Rabbi Kuzlan, a relative of R. Meir, declared that A had deposited money with him and had told him to give the money, after A's death, to R. Mushlin, A's brother, who had received instructions regarding its disposal. Rabbi Kuzlan, therefore, gave the money to R. Mushlin. The latter claims that he was instructed by A to give all the money to A's children by his former marriage. R. Liber Shamash, another relative of R. Meir, testified that A made the following declaration in his presence: \"Half of all the ready cash I have here, and in the house of Rabbi Kuzlan, and in the settlement, was given to Gershom my son, and the other half to his two older sisters, and I have empowered my brother Mushlin thus to dispose of the deposit that is in the house.\" L, on the other hand, produced a document wherein it was written that A had obligated himself not to alienate any of his property and thus put it beyond his wife's reach. L, therefore, demands that R. Mushlin take an oath to support his assertions.<br><i>A</i>. The testimony of R. Liber Shamash is of no consequence since a verbal admission of having given valuables to a certain person, is no proof that title to such valuables was actually transferred to that person. Therefore, R. Mushlin has no witness to support his assertions. Although heirs may not exact an oath from a trustee appointed by their father (Gitt. 52a), this rule applies only to the heirs, who are to inherit the property managed by the trustee; but, the heirs who, according to the assertions of the trustee, are not to receive any part of such property, may exact an oath from the trustee even though they are not positive in their claim that the trustee had wronged them. Therefore, L and her children may exact the oath from R. Mushlin. Moreover, even if R. Mushlin's assertions were true, A's gift to his children by his former marriage would be considered a gift <i>causa mortis</i>, since it was to be given to them after A's death. Since a widow and orphaned daughters are entitled to draw their sustenance from all <i>causa mortis</i> gifts, L and her daughters would be entitled to draw their sustenance, and L would be entitled to collect her <i>ketubah</i>, from the money in the hands of R. Mushlin, if no unencumbered assets remain of A's estate. L's daughters are entitled to receive their sustenance till their marriage, the expense to be born proportionately by A's heirs (out of their inheritance). At the time of their marriage they will be entitled to a dowry of one tenth the immovables of A's estate. L's son, however, must derive his sustenance from his own portion of the inheritance, and when it will all be consumed he will have to resort to charity.<br><i>Q</i>. L, at the time of her arrest, hired an agent to manage A's estate, to collect debts and sell valuables, in order to raise money for the ransom. She agreed to pay the agent a large sum of money for his efforts. Furthermore, R. Mushlin claims to have incurred expenses in his efforts to save L and A's children.<br><i>A</i>. Since L had a right to hire an agent (Gitt. 52a) and since she was in urgent need of help, the agent is entitled to receive adequate compensation for his efforts; the court is to determine what constitutes adequate compensation. The agent, however, is not entitled to receive anything above such amount, even though L had promised him much more, for wages and hire are subject to reassessment. If R. Mushlin's claim is disputed, he must take an oath to support it. L had no right to sell any part of A's estate unless such sale was made in the presence of a lay court. Therefore, the articles sold must be reevaluated by such a court. If the articles had been sold below such evaluation, the difference should be deducted from L's <i>ketubah</i>; but if the articles were sold above the estimated value, the difference should revert to the heirs.<br><i>Q</i>. Upon her marriage, A's daughter by a former marriage was given by R. Mushlin, as part of her dowry, her share (one quarter) of the money originally deposited with Rabbi Kuzlan (see part 3).<br><i>A</i>. L was entitled to collect a proportionate part of her <i>ketubah</i> exclusively from this money; now that this money had been given to the husband of A's daughter, L may no longer collect that part of her <i>ketubah</i>. Therefore, R. Mushlin has directly damaged L's interests and must make good, out of his own pocket, the loss thus sustained by L.<br><i>Q</i>. Are the heirs permitted to pay L her <i>ketubah</i> by transferring to her debts due from Gentiles, if she objects to such manner of payment?<br><i>A</i>. Debts due from Gentiles can not be directly assigned to a third person. Even though there is an indirect method of assigning such debts, a woman may refuse such manner of payment since even a creditor or one who has suffered damage may refuse to receive payment in such manner. Moreover, a woman is not expected to suffer the hardships and indignities entailed in collecting debts from Gentiles. Therefore, L may insist on being paid only in nonencumbered valuables.<br><i>Q</i>. During the perilous period of the persecution by the overlord, a Gentile who owed ten <i>marks</i> to A came to L and asked her to release him from this debt. L, fearing lest refusal would aggravate the situation, said to the Gentile: \"I shall never demand this money from you\". A's heirs claim that this release caused them an unnecessary loss of ten <i>marks</i>.<br><i>A</i>. Neither according to Jewish law nor according to the law of the land does L's statement release the debtor from his obligation to A's heirs. But, if according to the law of your particular town this debt is considered cancelled, L is to be held responsible for the amount the debt was worth at the time of the release. Surely the debt was not worth very much at a time when the creditor was in mortal danger! However, if L released the aforementioned debtor, as a safety measure, and as a contributing factor to gain relief, the loss must be born by L, and the heirs that were in town at the time, <i>pro rata</i>.<br><i>Q</i>. A had deposited one pound with a burgher. After L came to terms with the overlord, the burgher returned the pound. L and the heirs who were in town during the period of danger, claim that it would have been impossible to collect the pound from the burgher if the settlement had not been effected with the overlord, while the other heirs claim that the burgher would have returned the money in any event.<br><i>A</i>. If L is not able to take an oath to the effect, that (she is certain that) the deposit would in all probability have been lost if not for the settlement with the overlord, no ransom money can be collected from this deposit.<br><i>Q</i>. The youngest heir received for his share debts due to the estate. The market value of these debts was much less than their face value. Since every heir must contribute to the payment of L's <i>ketubah</i> in proportion to the amount of money, he or she, inherited from A's estate, what amount is the youngest heir to contribute?<br><i>A</i>. He must contribute in proportion to the market value of the debts.<br><i>Q</i>. Two notes of indebtedness were held in A's room which had been sealed up by the overlord (at the time of the extortion). Are the investments attested to by these notes, subject to the payment of the ransom money?<br><i>A</i>. These investments are in the same category as the money and the valuables that were held in the room; for had no agreement been reached with the overlord, he would have taken away the notes of indebtedness, and the investments would have been lost. Even when the notes are presented to (Gentile) debtors, they are often unwilling to repay their debts; when such notes are lost, one can not expect repayment. Moreover, the overlord would have collected these debts for himself.<br><i>Q</i>. L took from Gershom's share debts to the value of one hundred and seventy pounds. Now that Gershom is not required to pay any ransom money, how can he collect his money?<br><i>A</i>. Gershom may charge this amount to his sisters' shares of the ransom money and collect it from them, or he may charge it to the payment of L's <i>ketubah</i>. L does not have to collect her <i>ketubah</i>, or the ransom money, directly from the orphan girls; she may collect it from their money in the hands of R. Mushlin. The latter has no right to give the money he holds, to anyone until L receives all that is due her from the heirs, both male and female, each one according to his share.<br>If R. Mushlin has already given this money to the heirs, or should he in the future give it to them in order to put obstacles in L's way, and thus make it difficult for her to collect her money, then R. Mushlin is to be held responsible for such payments, and is to pay L out of his own pocket.<br>R. Meir adds: \"You have protracted your case and have burdened me beyond endurance. I cannot bear your sending me any further inquiries regarding this case. It is obvious that the trustees are only interested in causing annoyance, vexation and protraction. From now on judge any case that may come before you, yourselves!\" R. Meir further adds: \"At last it has become apparent, it is sad to reflect, that all these cunning machinations are employed only to harass the widow, to procrastinate, and to deprive her of her <i>ketubah</i>; but you are merely succeeding in troubling and harassing me to no purpose.\"<br>These Responsa are addressed to \"My relatives Rabbi Elijah and Rabbi David\".<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am II, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23."

                        "<i>Q</i>. A paid his taxes directly to the overlord of his town, independently of the rest of the community. The overlord, suspecting that A possessed much greater wealth than he usually professed to have, and being driven by a greed for money, arrested him without cause and later arrested his wife L. Before her arrest, however, and before the reason for these arrests became manifest, L helped Gershom, A's son by a previous marriage, to flee the domain of the overlord and thus escape from his clutches. Meanwhile, A was put to death in prison. The overlord posted guards in the town to make sure that A's children did not escape, and demanded a large sum of money from L. He further proposed that L merge her taxes with those of the community and that the latter jointly with L negotiate the new tax. When the community representatives asked as to the identity of the persons who would be expected to pay this tax, the overlord answered that everybody would pay it, the young and the old, the rich and the poor. The community representatives, then, strongly objected to the merger with L; whereupon the overlord agreed to negotiate with them separately. He levied a very heavy tax on the community, but this tax did not exceed the estimated value of the wealth of the community members. L was warned that should she prove to be stubborn and unyielding, she and A's children would be made to suffer the same fate as A. Finally the overlord came to terms with L and agreed to release her, and to return to her A's impounded valuables, for a ransom of six hundred and twenty pounds. To insure the payment of this ransom the overlord demanded as hostages one of L's children and one of A's children by his former marriage. Now Gershom, and A's other children by his former marriage, refuse to pay their part of the ransom money, and instead, wish to pay their part of the assessment on the community.<br><i>A</i>. Gershom is not obliged to pay any part of the ransom money since he escaped before the overlord asked for such money. Although L engineered his escape, he is under no monetary obligation to her, since she merely did him a favor. However, if Gershom is to claim, as his share of the inheritance, part of A's valuables that have remained in town within the grasp of the overlord, he must pay a proportionate part of the ransom for such valuables. A's children by his former marriage must pay their part of the ransom money in proportion to their wealth. Even though they were not imprisoned, there is sufficient indication that the overlord intended to include them in the extortion. Thus, guards had been posted in town to watch them, and their lives had been explicitly threatened upon L's refusal to come to terms with the overlord. Moreover, had the overlord negotiated with L regarding only her personal possessions, he would not have demanded 620 pounds from her, knowing full well that she was entitled to receive from A's estate only her <i>ketubah</i>, and that such a sum was well beyond her means. The overlord did not demand from the community a sum greater than the value of all their wealth; therefore, it stands to reason that he was not entirely unreasonable in his demands upon L. We may assume with certainty that had L refused to pay the ransom, A's children would have been seized, and would have been killed or forcibly baptized. Had A's children protested against being ransomed, we would have paid no attention to them and would have effected their release even against their will, and then, we would have collected the ransom money from them; for we are obliged to ransom a Jew even against his will. Now, that A's children have not protested against the ransom, they must certainly contribute thereto in proportion to their wealth. Although their lives were threatened, and the talmudic law (B.B. 116b) would thus require that the amount of the ransom money should be calculated, one half equally for each person, and the other half in proportion to the individual's wealth, this law does not apply to our case. We know that the overlord was interested only in their money, not in taking their lives, as the whole trouble started because the overlord thought A to be very wealthy.<br><i>Q</i>. L seized some of A's movables claiming that she seized them for the purpose of paying for her sustenance. Some of these movables were originally impounded by the overlord and were later returned to L. May A's heirs force L to render under oath an account of such valuables?<br><i>A</i>. Movables impounded by an overlord are considered abandoned property (<i>hefker</i>), title thereto, passing to the first person who seizes them, since the original owner must have given up hope of retrieving them. Although owners do not usually abandon movables taken away by Gentile robbers (B.K. 114a), they do abandon these when impounded by the overlord of the town, since he is the undisputed master of the town and no one can restrain him. This was especially true in our case, since his claim was bolstered by false accusations. Therefore, L is under no obligation to give an account of the movables returned to her by the overlord. However, those movables which the overlord had returned to her, and which she gave to the overlord in partial payment of the ransom, should be credited <i>pro rata</i> to all those who are obliged to pay the ransom, since the valuables had been given to her in order to decrease the ransom for all parties involved. Furthermore, L is under no obligation to give an accounting of the other movables she seized (the movables that were not impounded by the overlord) as long as it is known that the value of such movables does not exceed the value of her <i>ketubah</i>. For whenever L demands her <i>ketubah</i>, she will have to take an oath regarding these movables; as long as she does not demand her <i>ketubah</i>, no oath can be imposed on her.<br><i>Q</i>. Rabbi Kuzlan, a relative of R. Meir, declared that A had deposited money with him and had told him to give the money, after A's death, to R.

She agreed to pay the agent a large sum of money for his efforts. Furthermore, R. Mushlin claims to have incurred expenses in his efforts to save L and A's children.<br><i>A</i>. Since L had a right to hire an agent (Gitt. 52a) and since she was in urgent need of help, the agent is entitled to receive adequate compensation for his efforts; the court is to determine what constitutes adequate compensation. The agent, however, is not entitled to receive anything above such amount, even though L had promised him much more, for wages and hire are subject to reassessment. If R. Mushlin's claim is disputed, he must take an oath to support it. L had no right to sell any part of A's estate unless such sale was made in the presence of a lay court. Therefore, the articles sold must be reevaluated by such a court. If the articles had been sold below such evaluation, the difference should be deducted from L's <i>ketubah</i>; but if the articles were sold above the estimated value, the difference should revert to the heirs.<br><i>Q</i>. Upon her marriage, A's daughter by a former marriage was given by R. Mushlin, as part of her dowry, her share (one quarter) of the money originally deposited with Rabbi Kuzlan (see part 3).<br><i>A</i>. L was entitled to collect a proportionate part of her <i>ketubah</i> exclusively from this money; now that this money had been given to the husband of A's daughter, L may no longer collect that part of her <i>ketubah</i>. Therefore, R. Mushlin has directly damaged L's interests and must make good, out of his own pocket, the loss thus sustained by L.<br><i>Q</i>. Are the heirs permitted to pay L her <i>ketubah</i> by transferring to her debts due from Gentiles, if she objects to such manner of payment?<br><i>A</i>. Debts due from Gentiles can not be directly assigned to a third person. Even though there is an indirect method of assigning such debts, a woman may refuse such manner of payment since even a creditor or one who has suffered damage may refuse to receive payment in such manner. Moreover, a woman is not expected to suffer the hardships and indignities entailed in collecting debts from Gentiles. Therefore, L may insist on being paid only in nonencumbered valuables.<br><i>Q</i>. During the perilous period of the persecution by the overlord, a Gentile who owed ten <i>marks</i> to A came to L and asked her to release him from this debt. L, fearing lest refusal would aggravate the situation, said to the Gentile: \"I shall never demand this money from you\". A's heirs claim that this release caused them an unnecessary loss of ten <i>marks</i>.<br><i>A</i>. Neither according to Jewish law nor according to the law of the land does L's statement release the debtor from his obligation to A's heirs. But, if according to the law of your particular town this debt is considered cancelled, L is to be held responsible for the amount the debt was worth at the time of the release. Surely the debt was not worth very much at a time when the creditor was in mortal danger! However, if L released the aforementioned debtor, as a safety measure, and as a contributing factor to gain relief, the loss must be born by L, and the heirs that were in town at the time, <i>pro rata</i>.<br><i>Q</i>. A had deposited one pound with a burgher. After L came to terms with the overlord, the burgher returned the pound. L and the heirs who were in town during the period of danger, claim that it would have been impossible to collect the pound from the burgher if the settlement had not been effected with the overlord, while the other heirs claim that the burgher would have returned the money in any event.<br><i>A</i>. If L is not able to take an oath to the effect, that (she is certain that) the deposit would in all probability have been lost if not for the settlement with the overlord, no ransom money can be collected from this deposit.<br><i>Q</i>. The youngest heir received for his share debts due to the estate. The market value of these debts was much less than their face value. Since every heir must contribute to the payment of L's <i>ketubah</i> in proportion to the amount of money, he or she, inherited from A's estate, what amount is the youngest heir to contribute?<br><i>A</i>. He must contribute in proportion to the market value of the debts.<br><i>Q</i>. Two notes of indebtedness were held in A's room which had been sealed up by the overlord (at the time of the extortion). Are the investments attested to by these notes, subject to the payment of the ransom money?<br><i>A</i>. These investments are in the same category as the money and the valuables that were held in the room; for had no agreement been reached with the overlord, he would have taken away the notes of indebtedness, and the investments would have been lost. Even when the notes are presented to (Gentile) debtors, they are often unwilling to repay their debts; when such notes are lost, one can not expect repayment. Moreover, the overlord would have collected these debts for himself.<br><i>Q</i>. L took from Gershom's share debts to the value of one hundred and seventy pounds. Now that Gershom is not required to pay any ransom money, how can he collect his money?<br><i>A</i>. Gershom may charge this amount to his sisters' shares of the ransom money and collect it from them, or he may charge it to the payment of L's <i>ketubah</i>. L does not have to collect her <i>ketubah</i>, or the ransom money, directly from the orphan girls; she may collect it from their money in the hands of R. Mushlin. The latter has no right to give the money he holds, to anyone until L receives all that is due her from the heirs, both male and female, each one according to his share.<br>If R. Mushlin has already given this money to the heirs, or should he in the future give it to them in order to put obstacles in L's way, and thus make it difficult for her to collect her money, then R. Mushlin is to be held responsible for such payments, and is to pay L out of his own pocket.<br>R. Meir adds: \"You have protracted your case and have burdened me beyond endurance. I cannot bear your sending me any further inquiries regarding this case. It is obvious that the trustees are only interested in causing annoyance, vexation and protraction. From now on judge any case that may come before you, yourselves!\" R. Meir further adds: \"At last it has become apparent, it is sad to reflect, that all these cunning machinations are employed only to harass the widow, to procrastinate, and to deprive her of her <i>ketubah</i>; but you are merely succeeding in troubling and harassing me to no purpose.\"<br>These Responsa are addressed to \"My relatives Rabbi Elijah and Rabbi David\".<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am II, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23."

                        "<i>Q</i>. A paid his taxes directly to the overlord of his town, independently of the rest of the community. The overlord, suspecting that A possessed much greater wealth than he usually professed to have, and being driven by a greed for money, arrested him without cause and later arrested his wife L. Before her arrest, however, and before the reason for these arrests became manifest, L helped Gershom, A's son by a previous marriage, to flee the domain of the overlord and thus escape from his clutches. Meanwhile, A was put to death in prison. The overlord posted guards in the town to make sure that A's children did not escape, and demanded a large sum of money from L. He further proposed that L merge her taxes with those of the community and that the latter jointly with L negotiate the new tax. When the community representatives asked as to the identity of the persons who would be expected to pay this tax, the overlord answered that everybody would pay it, the young and the old, the rich and the poor. The community representatives, then, strongly objected to the merger with L; whereupon the overlord agreed to negotiate with them separately. He levied a very heavy tax on the community, but this tax did not exceed the estimated value of the wealth of the community members. L was warned that should she prove to be stubborn and unyielding, she and A's children would be made to suffer the same fate as A. Finally the overlord came to terms with L and agreed to release her, and to return to her A's impounded valuables, for a ransom of six hundred and twenty pounds. To insure the payment of this ransom the overlord demanded as hostages one of L's children and one of A's children by his former marriage. Now Gershom, and A's other children by his former marriage, refuse to pay their part of the ransom money, and instead, wish to pay their part of the assessment on the community.<br><i>A</i>. Gershom is not obliged to pay any part of the ransom money since he escaped before the overlord asked for such money. Although L engineered his escape, he is under no monetary obligation to her, since she merely did him a favor. However, if Gershom is to claim, as his share of the inheritance, part of A's valuables that have remained in town within the grasp of the overlord, he must pay a proportionate part of the ransom for such valuables. A's children by his former marriage must pay their part of the ransom money in proportion to their wealth. Even though they were not imprisoned, there is sufficient indication that the overlord intended to include them in the extortion. Thus, guards had been posted in town to watch them, and their lives had been explicitly threatened upon L's refusal to come to terms with the overlord. Moreover, had the overlord negotiated with L regarding only her personal possessions, he would not have demanded 620 pounds from her, knowing full well that she was entitled to receive from A's estate only her <i>ketubah</i>, and that such a sum was well beyond her means. The overlord did not demand from the community a sum greater than the value of all their wealth; therefore, it stands to reason that he was not entirely unreasonable in his demands upon L. We may assume with certainty that had L refused to pay the ransom, A's children would have been seized, and would have been killed or forcibly baptized. Had A's children protested against being ransomed, we would have paid no attention to them and would have effected their release even against their will, and then, we would have collected the ransom money from them; for we are obliged to ransom a Jew even against his will. Now, that A's children have not protested against the ransom, they must certainly contribute thereto in proportion to their wealth. Although their lives were threatened, and the talmudic law (B.B. 116b) would thus require that the amount of the ransom money should be calculated, one half equally for each person, and the other half in proportion to the individual's wealth, this law does not apply to our case. We know that the overlord was interested only in their money, not in taking their lives, as the whole trouble started because the overlord thought A to be very wealthy.<br><i>Q</i>. L seized some of A's movables claiming that she seized them for the purpose of paying for her sustenance. Some of these movables were originally impounded by the overlord and were later returned to L. May A's heirs force L to render under oath an account of such valuables?<br><i>A</i>. Movables impounded by an overlord are considered abandoned property (<i>hefker</i>), title thereto, passing to the first person who seizes them, since the original owner must have given up hope of retrieving them. Although owners do not usually abandon movables taken away by Gentile robbers (B.K. 114a), they do abandon these when impounded by the overlord of the town, since he is the undisputed master of the town and no one can restrain him. This was especially true in our case, since his claim was bolstered by false accusations. Therefore, L is under no obligation to give an account of the movables returned to her by the overlord. However, those movables which the overlord had returned to her, and which she gave to the overlord in partial payment of the ransom, should be credited <i>pro rata</i> to all those who are obliged to pay the ransom, since the valuables had been given to her in order to decrease the ransom for all parties involved. Furthermore, L is under no obligation to give an accounting of the other movables she seized (the movables that were not impounded by the overlord) as long as it is known that the value of such movables does not exceed the value of her <i>ketubah</i>. For whenever L demands her <i>ketubah</i>, she will have to take an oath regarding these movables; as long as she does not demand her <i>ketubah</i>, no oath can be imposed on her.<br><i>Q</i>. Rabbi Kuzlan, a relative of R. Meir, declared that A had deposited money with him and had told him to give the money, after A's death, to R. Mushlin, A's brother, who had received instructions regarding its disposal. Rabbi Kuzlan, therefore, gave the money to R. Mushlin. The latter claims that he was instructed by A to give all the money to A's children by his former marriage. R. Liber Shamash, another relative of R. Meir, testified that A made the following declaration in his presence: \"Half of all the ready cash I have here, and in the house of Rabbi Kuzlan, and in the settlement, was given to Gershom my son, and the other half to his two older sisters, and I have empowered my brother Mushlin thus to dispose of the deposit that is in the house.\" L, on the other hand, produced a document wherein it was written that A had obligated himself not to alienate any of his property and thus put it beyond his wife's reach. L, therefore, demands that R. Mushlin take an oath to support his assertions.<br><i>A</i>. The testimony of R. Liber Shamash is of no consequence since a verbal admission of having given valuables to a certain person, is no proof that title to such valuables was actually transferred to that person. Therefore, R. Mushlin has no witness to support his assertions. Although heirs may not exact an oath from a trustee appointed by their father (Gitt. 52a), this rule applies only to the heirs, who are to inherit the property managed by the trustee; but, the heirs who, according to the assertions of the trustee, are not to receive any part of such property, may exact an oath from the trustee even though they are not positive in their claim that the trustee had wronged them. Therefore, L and her children may exact the oath from R. Mushlin. Moreover, even if R. Mushlin's assertions were true, A's gift to his children by his former marriage would be considered a gift <i>causa mortis</i>, since it was to be given to them after A's death. Since a widow and orphaned daughters are entitled to draw their sustenance from all <i>causa mortis</i> gifts, L and her daughters would be entitled to draw their sustenance, and L would be entitled to collect her <i>ketubah</i>, from the money in the hands of R. Mushlin, if no unencumbered assets remain of A's estate. L's daughters are entitled to receive their sustenance till their marriage, the expense to be born proportionately by A's heirs (out of their inheritance). At the time of their marriage they will be entitled to a dowry of one tenth the immovables of A's estate. L's son, however, must derive his sustenance from his own portion of the inheritance, and when it will all be consumed he will have to resort to charity.<br><i>Q</i>.

L, fearing lest refusal would aggravate the situation, said to the Gentile: \"I shall never demand this money from you\". A's heirs claim that this release caused them an unnecessary loss of ten <i>marks</i>.<br><i>A</i>. Neither according to Jewish law nor according to the law of the land does L's statement release the debtor from his obligation to A's heirs. But, if according to the law of your particular town this debt is considered cancelled, L is to be held responsible for the amount the debt was worth at the time of the release. Surely the debt was not worth very much at a time when the creditor was in mortal danger! However, if L released the aforementioned debtor, as a safety measure, and as a contributing factor to gain relief, the loss must be born by L, and the heirs that were in town at the time, <i>pro rata</i>.<br><i>Q</i>. A had deposited one pound with a burgher. After L came to terms with the overlord, the burgher returned the pound. L and the heirs who were in town during the period of danger, claim that it would have been impossible to collect the pound from the burgher if the settlement had not been effected with the overlord, while the other heirs claim that the burgher would have returned the money in any event.<br><i>A</i>. If L is not able to take an oath to the effect, that (she is certain that) the deposit would in all probability have been lost if not for the settlement with the overlord, no ransom money can be collected from this deposit.<br><i>Q</i>. The youngest heir received for his share debts due to the estate. The market value of these debts was much less than their face value. Since every heir must contribute to the payment of L's <i>ketubah</i> in proportion to the amount of money, he or she, inherited from A's estate, what amount is the youngest heir to contribute?<br><i>A</i>. He must contribute in proportion to the market value of the debts.<br><i>Q</i>. Two notes of indebtedness were held in A's room which had been sealed up by the overlord (at the time of the extortion). Are the investments attested to by these notes, subject to the payment of the ransom money?<br><i>A</i>. These investments are in the same category as the money and the valuables that were held in the room; for had no agreement been reached with the overlord, he would have taken away the notes of indebtedness, and the investments would have been lost. Even when the notes are presented to (Gentile) debtors, they are often unwilling to repay their debts; when such notes are lost, one can not expect repayment. Moreover, the overlord would have collected these debts for himself.<br><i>Q</i>. L took from Gershom's share debts to the value of one hundred and seventy pounds. Now that Gershom is not required to pay any ransom money, how can he collect his money?<br><i>A</i>. Gershom may charge this amount to his sisters' shares of the ransom money and collect it from them, or he may charge it to the payment of L's <i>ketubah</i>. L does not have to collect her <i>ketubah</i>, or the ransom money, directly from the orphan girls; she may collect it from their money in the hands of R. Mushlin. The latter has no right to give the money he holds, to anyone until L receives all that is due her from the heirs, both male and female, each one according to his share.<br>If R. Mushlin has already given this money to the heirs, or should he in the future give it to them in order to put obstacles in L's way, and thus make it difficult for her to collect her money, then R. Mushlin is to be held responsible for such payments, and is to pay L out of his own pocket.<br>R. Meir adds: \"You have protracted your case and have burdened me beyond endurance. I cannot bear your sending me any further inquiries regarding this case. It is obvious that the trustees are only interested in causing annoyance, vexation and protraction. From now on judge any case that may come before you, yourselves!\" R. Meir further adds: \"At last it has become apparent, it is sad to reflect, that all these cunning machinations are employed only to harass the widow, to procrastinate, and to deprive her of her <i>ketubah</i>; but you are merely succeeding in troubling and harassing me to no purpose.\"<br>These Responsa are addressed to \"My relatives Rabbi Elijah and Rabbi David\".<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am II, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23."

                        "<i>Q</i>. We, the undersigned, were chosen as examiners and recorders of the claims of A and the widow L. Consequently, witnesses have testified before us: a) that when A was ill he asked his wife, R, to agree to an arrangement that would bring solace to their souls; b) that A and R, therefore, made a legally binding arrangement in their presence, to the effect that if A died first R would give three <i>marks</i> and A's clothes to a charity stipulated by him; and if R died first A would give six <i>marks</i> and R's clothes to a charity stipulated by her; and c) that subsequently A recovered from his illness, but R became critically ill and died of her illness. R's mother, L, came before us and claimed that, before her death, R appointed her (L) trustee of the six <i>marks</i> and the clothes, and that she asked her to distribute the same to any charity she saw fit. L, therefore, demanded the six <i>marks</i> and R's clothes from A. A on the other hand, claimed that he asked his wife before her death why she had not stipulated the recipients of this charity, and in reply she authorized him to spend two <i>marks</i> on the cemetery, either for the purpose of constructing a wall or for obtaining sand; to give half a <i>mark</i> for the sick, and to give the rest to R's needy relatives. Neither L nor A have any witnesses to support their assertions. Regarding the garments demanded by L, A claimed that L had already taken away all of R's clothes with the exception of one cloak. A demanded that L return to him his wife's seven gold rings, the two pieces of silver jewelry, the two Cologne gulden, and the money that was in R's pocket, which L had taken. L averred that she had returned to A everything that belonged to him. L further demanded that A pay her the expenses she incurred in transporting her daughter's body to another place for burial. A averred that he had paid for the casket and the shrouds; that L had transported R's body without his knowledge and consent; that he had intended to bury her in our town since there was a cemetery in our town; and that L had incurred unnecessary expenses in having R's relatives accompany the body to the place of burial. L, on the other hand, claimed that A had known of her intentions to transport her daughter to another town for burial, that A had consented to it, and that she could prove the truth of these contentions through the testimony of A's tutor, should the latter be forced to testify by a <i>herem</i>. A's tutor was summoned before us and testified to the following facts: A told him that he, A, would have accompanied his wife's body to the place of burial were he able to leave the house; he asked the tutor whether he was willing to take his place; the tutor agreed and accompanied the hearse as instructed. Three days after the claims in question were placed before us, L further claimed that A had been at odds with her daughter and, therefore, the latter did not entrust to him the charity money, and preferred that L distribute it. A denied this claim asserting that there was never any enmity between him and his wife, and that, on the contrary, she became very affectionate toward him during her illness and tried to show this affection in many ways. L also claimed that she had already distributed R's clothes in accordance with the latter's instructions; while A claimed to have warned L not to give anything away without his consent. A discovered some of the garments distributed by L in the hands of the recipients. Please explain in detail who is to be entrusted with the distribution of the charity money, and please write your answer on the reverse side of this parchment. Signed: Samuel b. Eliezer haKohen; Kalonymus b. Asher; Nahman b. Nathan.<br><i>A</i>. If L claims that A was present when her daughter appointed her the distributor of the money and the clothes, A must take cognizance of her claims and must take an oath denying such claims. After taking such an oath, A will have to give to charity in the presence of witnesses the six <i>marks</i> and the clothes still in his possession. But, if L admits that A was not present at the time she was thus appointed distributor of the money and the clothes, A is under no obligation to L and must proceed to give them to charity in the presence of witnesses. L., on the other hand, must take an oath to the effect that she did not take anything belonging to A, that she has distributed R's clothes in accordance with the latter's instructions, and be free from obligation. As to the expenses of R's funeral, if some of R's relatives, or some of A's relatives, had been transported and buried in the cemetery to which R's body was transported, A was under obligation to bury R in that cemetery, since a husband is obliged to bury his wife with all the honor and dignity customary in her family, or in his family, whichever be the greater. Therefore, A must pay L the expenses she incurred in the burial of her daughter, and must also repay all loans extended to L for that purpose. Moreover, even if no relatives of A or R were ever buried in this cemetery, since A sent his tutor to participate in the funeral, he thus gave his consent to the proceedings and must pay the expenses thereof. The amount of such expenses are to be attested to by L under oath. However, A is responsible only for the expenses strictly necessary for the funeral, but not for any unnecessary extravagances.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am II, 33."

These two strangers, however, were brothers-in-law and one was the nephew of the other. Rabbi Kohen Zedek, then, told A that since these two were related to each other they were disqualified witnesses and consequently the betrothal would be void. A, however, answered that no great harm would be done even if the betrothal were void since the bridegroom would ultimately betroth the bride again, at the time of the marriage.

Meir's) teacher from Spiers at first agreed with this decision but later disagreed with it; and that meanwhile A's daughter became betrothed to another man.<br>Rabbi Meir answered that the first decision of his teacher was correct; that in the case of a woman who was betrothed in the presence of two witnesses, one of whom was later discovered to be related to the bridegroom, Rabbi Joel haLevi decided in a Responsum that the woman did not need a divorce, and permitted her to remarry; and that he enclosed a copy of Rabbi Joel's Responsum in order to prove that his own decision was based on a solid foundation. He added: A rumor is of no consequence unless it be current in the town where the alleged betrothal took place. In this case, however, A and his sons were the only Jewish residents of the settlement, and they were told beforehand that such a betrothal would be void. Moreover, even the authorities who hold that we cannot dispel a rumor, agree that when a rumor is self-contradictory, or the statements made therein are not untrue but harmless, such rumor is of no consequence. We are not at liberty to be overstringent in such cases and demand that a divorce be delivered in order to dispel any shadow of doubt as to the girl's freedom to remarry, since such a step would make her ineligible to marry a man of priestly lineage.<br>The leaders of the communities [Spiers, Worms, and Mayence] upon learning that R. Meir permitted A's daughter to become betrothed to another man without first receiving a divorce from her first bridegroom, became highly incensed and heaped abuse upon R. Meir for having permitted a married woman to remarry. Rabbi Mordecai [of Worms, cf. Mord. Ket. 290] and his associates wrote that Rabbi Hananel in his <i>Sefer Hamikzoot</i>, the author of <i>Sekel Tob</i>, Rabiah, and Rabbi Simha [of Spiers], all ruled that a woman who was betrothed in the presence of unqualified witnesses, must receive her divorce before she is permitted to remarry. They placed A and his daughter [but probably not R. Meir] under the ban in order to force A's daughter to receive a divorce from her second bridegroom.<br>R. Meir became highly indignant. He pointed out the clear distinction between witnesses who were rabbinically disqualified and those who were Biblically disqualified. He proved that the above-mentioned authorities as well as Alfasi, Rabbi Kalonymus, and the author of <i>Ittur</i> [Rabbi Isaac b. Abba Mari of Marseilles] all agreed that a woman who was betrothed in the presence of Biblically disqualified witnesses required no divorce and was free to marry another. He showed that not a single authority contravened this view, and that the Rabbis of Spiers were misled in their haste and zeal by a faulty reading of the <i>Sekel Tob</i>.<br>R. Meir added: if the Rabbis of the communities subsequently discover an authority who ruled that such a woman must receive a divorce, they should realize that such a divorce was not required by Biblical law nor by rabbinic law, but that the authority of his own accord ruled that a divorce take place merely to dissipate evil gossip. Since the first betrothal of A's daughter took place in the presence of two witnesses who were beyond a doubt Biblically disqualified witnesses, as one of them was the nephew of the other, the betrothal was void; especially so since even at that time it was known to all bystanders that the betrothal possessed no validity whatsoever. Since she was subsequently betrothed to another, having first received permission from an authoritative court, no authority in the world would require that the Biblically valid second betrothal should be dissolved merely in order to dissipate unfounded doubts. Moreover, we are expressly enjoined by the Talmud from requiring that she receive a divorce from her second bridegroom, since such divorce would disqualify her from ever marrying her first bridegroom (Yeb. 11b). If the leaders of the communities are highly sensitive and are bent on dissipating any doubt in the matter, they should force the first bridegroom to grant a divorce to A's daughter and I, on my part, shall compel her to accept the divorce. Although such a divorce is unnecessary, and hence should not be granted, as it would bar the woman from ever marrying a man of priestly lineage, I should overlook this point in honor of the Rabbis of the communities. Accordingly A's daughter will wait for a divorce till the feast of <i>Purim</i>. If the communities will be unable to effect the divorce within that time, because of the stubbornness of the bridegroom and his refusal to comply with their request, we shall go against the wishes of the community leaders and allow A's daughter to marry her second bridegroom; as we shall not permit that she be put in a position where she can never remarry.<br>We have never seen revered teachers of old act in the manner of the above-mentioned community leaders. Differences of opinions have often arisen among the great authorities, some prohibiting what others permitted, but never did any one dare place under the ban those who acted contrary to his opinion. You, the aforementioned community leaders, probably delude yourselves with the idea that since your permission is required before a person may divorce his wife (see Finkelstein op. cit. p. 230), no scholar is permitted to render decisions in ritual law unless he receives your authorization. No, this is not true, for the <i>Torah</i> is free to anyone who is capable of arriving at a correct decision. You have gathered, and have associated with yourselves, men who do not understand the intricacies of the laws of marriage and divorce.

Meir permitted A's daughter to become betrothed to another man without first receiving a divorce from her first bridegroom, became highly incensed and heaped abuse upon R. Meir for having permitted a married woman to remarry. Rabbi Mordecai [of Worms, cf. Mord. Ket. 290] and his associates wrote that Rabbi Hananel in his <i>Sefer Hamikzoot</i>, the author of <i>Sekel Tob</i>, Rabiah, and Rabbi Simha [of Spiers], all ruled that a woman who was betrothed in the presence of unqualified witnesses, must receive her divorce before she is permitted to remarry. They placed A and his daughter [but probably not R. Meir] under the ban in order to force A's daughter to receive a divorce from her second bridegroom.<br>R. Meir became highly indignant. He pointed out the clear distinction between witnesses who were rabbinically disqualified and those who were Biblically disqualified. He proved that the above-mentioned authorities as well as Alfasi, Rabbi Kalonymus, and the author of <i>Ittur</i> [Rabbi Isaac b. Abba Mari of Marseilles] all agreed that a woman who was betrothed in the presence of Biblically disqualified witnesses required no divorce and was free to marry another. He showed that not a single authority contravened this view, and that the Rabbis of Spiers were misled in their haste and zeal by a faulty reading of the <i>Sekel Tob</i>.<br>R. Meir added: if the Rabbis of the communities subsequently discover an authority who ruled that such a woman must receive a divorce, they should realize that such a divorce was not required by Biblical law nor by rabbinic law, but that the authority of his own accord ruled that a divorce take place merely to dissipate evil gossip. Since the first betrothal of A's daughter took place in the presence of two witnesses who were beyond a doubt Biblically disqualified witnesses, as one of them was the nephew of the other, the betrothal was void; especially so since even at that time it was known to all bystanders that the betrothal possessed no validity whatsoever. Since she was subsequently betrothed to another, having first received permission from an authoritative court, no authority in the world would require that the Biblically valid second betrothal should be dissolved merely in order to dissipate unfounded doubts. Moreover, we are expressly enjoined by the Talmud from requiring that she receive a divorce from her second bridegroom, since such divorce would disqualify her from ever marrying her first bridegroom (Yeb. 11b). If the leaders of the communities are highly sensitive and are bent on dissipating any doubt in the matter, they should force the first bridegroom to grant a divorce to A's daughter and I, on my part, shall compel her to accept the divorce. Although such a divorce is unnecessary, and hence should not be granted, as it would bar the woman from ever marrying a man of priestly lineage, I should overlook this point in honor of the Rabbis of the communities. Accordingly A's daughter will wait for a divorce till the feast of <i>Purim</i>. If the communities will be unable to effect the divorce within that time, because of the stubbornness of the bridegroom and his refusal to comply with their request, we shall go against the wishes of the community leaders and allow A's daughter to marry her second bridegroom; as we shall not permit that she be put in a position where she can never remarry.<br>We have never seen revered teachers of old act in the manner of the above-mentioned community leaders. Differences of opinions have often arisen among the great authorities, some prohibiting what others permitted, but never did any one dare place under the ban those who acted contrary to his opinion. You, the aforementioned community leaders, probably delude yourselves with the idea that since your permission is required before a person may divorce his wife (see Finkelstein op. cit. p. 230), no scholar is permitted to render decisions in ritual law unless he receives your authorization. No, this is not true, for the <i>Torah</i> is free to anyone who is capable of arriving at a correct decision. You have gathered, and have associated with yourselves, men who do not understand the intricacies of the laws of marriage and divorce. I am not in a position to protest against my teacher of Spiers since I am his student [and owe him the respect and subservience of a student], but I protest against those who sought to ruin my reputation and honor. \"Blessed be the Lord who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth\".

Nowadays especially, since a woman may collect her <i>ketubah</i> from movables — and even after the loan is repaid to the orphans she may demand the money thus repaid in payment of her <i>ketubah</i> — she is entitled to collect directly from the debtor. Moreover, the custom of collecting the <i>ketubah</i> from movables and from loans, is well established in our time. Such a custom may be justified by the fact that the major part of our business consists of loans and investments. Similarly a first-born is entitled to a double share from a loan that had been secured by a pledge, since such a loan is not considered <i>raui</i> (a potential asset) but constitutes a real asset of the estate.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am II, 66."

                        "<i>Q</i>. A rented a house to B for five years and received the rent for the entire period in advance. He promised to repay B the expenses for any structures he might erect in the house, and gave him a written guaranty to this effect. B spent six pounds on such structures. Subsequently, A died and his widow, L, took over the house in payment of her <i>ketubah</i>.<br><i>A</i>. B must vacate the house; for L's <i>ketubah</i> was a lien upon it, before it was rented to B. L may remove anyone from the house, whether buyer, renter, or creditor; provided, of course, that her marriage to A took place, and A was owner of the house, before he sold it, rented it, or borrowed money. Therefore, if A left no movables and his estate does not exceed L's <i>ketubah</i>, B can not reclaim his money. If, however, A left movables with a third person, these movables ought to be turned over to B in payment of the obligation due him, and any excess should go to L. Whenever a creditor and a widow press their claims to an estate consisting of movables — unless the movables had previously been set aside by the husband for the payment of his wife's <i>ketubah</i> — the creditor has priority over the widow. The creditor's priority, however, as against the widow extends only to the payment of the <i>Ikkar ketubah</i>, the additional jointure, and that part of the dowry which the husband wrote in the <i>ketubah</i> in excess of what she actually gave him as dowry — thus in our <i>ketubah</i> we uniformly write that the wife brought in a dowry worth fifty pounds, regardless of the actual value of her dowry, and in our country a woman collects one hundred <i>marks</i> as her dowry, since we interpret the term \"pound\" to be a pound of weight, consisting of two <i>marks</i>. In regard to whatever the widow actually brought in as dowry she is considered a creditor sharing equally with other creditors in collecting from movables. Although a woman is entitled to collect the entire amount her husband wrote in the dowry clause of her <i>ketubah</i> in excess of what she actually brought in, she does not have equal right with a creditor in collecting that excess. Therefore, since in collecting her actual dowry from movables, L is on an equal footing with B, the movables mentioned above must be equally divided between L and B (and not in proportion to the respective obligations). When an estate consists of movables and immovables, and the latter do not suffice to cover the <i>ketubah</i>, the widow collects the <i>Ikkar ketubah</i>, the additional jointure, and the excess dowry, from the immovables, while she takes her part of the movables in payment of her actual dowry. The creditor may not claim that the immovables taken by the widow are in payment of her actual dowry, while she may not collect the rest of the <i>ketubah</i> from the movables until he, the creditor, collects his full debt therefrom, for the <i>Ikkar ketubah</i> and the additional jointure are liens upon the immovables, while in regard to the actual dowry she is considered a creditor entitled to share with the other creditors in collecting from movables (cf. Ket. 86a).<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am II, 67."

Nowadays that the Gentiles are all powerful, a Jewish woman who was held captive by them, even though only for the purpose of extortion, is not permitted to live with her husband (Ket. 27b).

The fact that the captives did not give their lives for their religion does not disqualify them as witnesses. Although a Jew is enjoined to choose death rather than be forced to worship idols, should he violate this law he would not become disqualified as a witness though he would be guilty of having committed a sin. Moreover, according to the account given by the captives, they never actually embraced Christianity, but merely listened without comment to the priest's recitation of his senseless ritual in the presence of the Gentiles.

                        "We were obliged to try the case of a betrothed, L, who demanded that her bridegroom, A (Jacob), come to her father's house and marry her there. A's father, B (Moses), representing his son, brought forth the following claims: a) When he (B) had arranged the match with L's father, C (Judah), he had promised C to send his son to live in C's house; b) he kept his promise, and, after A betrothed L through a messenger, he sent A to C; c) at the time the match was arranged C promised to clothe A suitably, to support him, and to hire a capable teacher for him; d) after A stayed in C's house for one year, he was sent back to his father and C took no further notice of him; A was forced to interrupt his studies and he, B, with very limited means, had to support him for five difficult years; and, f) he asked many persons to urge C to keep his promise of support to A, but C refused. The undersigned (R. Meir) also, sent many letters to C, asking him to have pity on his son-in-law who suffered poverty and privation — all to no avail. Moreover, we have learned (from a letter) that C does not at all desire the consummation of the marriage, but has set his heart on a divorce since A displeased him. Thus, B claims that he has fulfilled his promise and sent his son to C; but, that the latter put A to shame and now he, B, can no longer force A to return to C's house; that A is afraid to return to C's place of residence since many persons have warned him that C's servants were threatening to do him injury unless he agree to divorce L; that though A cannot, and will not, return to C, he is nevertheless ready to marry L whenever she will come to his place of residence.<br>Taking the above into consideration, we have decided that A cannot be compelled to settle in C's town, marry L, and live with her there; nor can he be forced to divorce L. Our decision is based on irrefutable proof: Thus, the majority of our leading authorities agree that a man living in one country who betrothed a woman living in another country, may force the woman to come and live with him in his country. Although the Tosephta (Ket. 13, 2) and the Palestinian Talmud, (Ket. 13, 10) seem to disagree on this score, we believe that our interpretation of the statements in these two sources removes the discrepancy and shows that both agree regarding this law. Moreover, when the man betrothed the woman through a messenger, there is not a shadow of a doubt that according to both sources given above, the woman ought to be forced to move to her husband's place of residence. This opinion is shared by Rashi, Maimonides and other leading authorities. R. Tam, however, believes that these sources deal with cases in which we force the husband to change his place of residence to that of his wife. Therefore, in view of this difference of opinion (although I do not agree with the view of R. Tam) we must accept the strictures of each opinion. Thus, we are forced to decide that neither the husband nor the wife can force a change in the other's place of residence. We cannot compel the husband to change his place of residence because of the opinion of Rashi, Maimonides, and the other leading authorities; but neither can we compel the wife to change her place of residence, because of the opinion of R. Tam. Although B had agreed at the time of the betrothal that A would settle in C's town, B had no right to bind A to such terms and we can find no evidence that A had voluntarily agreed to change his place of residence. The fact that A went to visit C is no evidence of such voluntary agreement. Moreover, he went on this visit after the betrothal, while we are concerned with his intentions at the time of the betrothal. Therefore, this agreement between B and C is void. Furthermore, had A himself voluntarily agreed at the time of the betrothal to move to C's place of residence, we should not be able to force A to keep his part of the agreement since C, on his part, had made many promises at that time which he later failed to keep.<br>Some Rabbis wrote their opinion that A should be compelled to move to L's place of residence since it was not dignified for a woman to move from place to place, as expressed by the verse: \"All glorious is the king's daughter within the palace\" (Ps. 45,11; cf. Git. 12a). Moreover, it is humiliating for a woman to pursue her husband into a distant place. However, I regard this manner of reasoning as very strange indeed; for in the talmudic period women were more honorable and discreet than today, and yet talmudic law required them to move to their husband's place of residence. The aforementioned Rabbis also wrote that since, according to the Talmud, a woman's station may be elevated through marriage but not lowered, L should not be forced to move to A's town. For L was brought up in great luxury and abundance, and were she to move to A's house she would have to share his poverty and privation. However, L would not have to suffer privation. C had promised A a large sum of money as a dowry; with that money A should be able to support L in a manner befitting her station, and on a standard equal to that of the other women of her family. Although she would miss some of the extravagances of her father's house, she would have to bear with such minor inconvenience. In conclusion, since A is ready to marry L whenever she will come to live in his town, we cannot compel A to move to L's town or to divorce her. This decision is required by talmudic law and the Rabbis made no distinction between a poor woman and a rich woman. Signed: R. Meir b. Baruch.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 386; Tesh.

Salomo, R. Jacob B. Joseph, R. Yehiel b. Jacob ha Levi, and R. Eliezer B. Ephraim, refer to the same case:<br>This letter is written regarding the youth of Rothenburg who betrothed, through a messenger, the daughter of R. Judah of Düren. At the time the match was concluded the youth's father had agreed that his son would take up his permanent abode with his father-in-law. After the betrothal the bridegroom came to stay with R. Judah who hired a teacher for him and treated him honorably for a long time. A year later the youth became sick and R. Judah, thinking that this was a result of the change of climate, sent him home accompanied by his teacher, and expended large sums of money on him. Subsequently, R. Judah sent for the youth to come to his house and marry his daughter. The youth, however, changed his mind on the matter of residence, and refused to come to Düren, stating however that he was ready to marry his bride if and when she came to live in Rothenburg. Thus it is apparent that the youth was intending to exact money from R. Judah. Therefore, it is my opinion that the youth be forced either to marry his bride on her terms, or divorce her. First, it is obvious that at the time of her betrothal the bridegroom had intended to settle in Düren. Secondly, his father had explicitly agreed with R. Judah to the youth's change of abode. Therefore, we assume that the youth also had agreed to it, since a young son does not dare to oppose his father and usually subscribes to the father's arrangement of his affairs. Again in agreements arising between the various parties interested in a marriage, the conditions apparently implied, though not expressly stated, are presumed to form part of such agreements (see Git. 65b; Ket. 54b; 79a; B. B. 132a). Thus, in our case, it is apparent that R. Judah did not intend to have his daughter leave him and her mother and remove from the country of her birth, and suffer privation in Rothenburg with her poverty stricken husband; that he did not intend to spend the large sum of money required to finance the safe conduct of one who was the daughter of a magnate whose name was known throughout the countries. Thus, the overlord of Rothenburg acting on the mere rumor [that R. Judah's daughter was coming to settle in Rothenburg] already sought ways of subjugating R. Judah to his will [using his daughter as a hostage]. Finally, according to the Talmud (Ket. 110b) a husband cannot force his wife to move from a humble to a more sumptuous dwelling since she can hold that such change of abode, even though it was for the better, would cause her many inconveniences. Any woman who gives plausible reasons against the change of abode demanded by her husband, therefore, cannot be forced to undertake such a change. In our case the bride's reasons against a change of abode are numerous and reasonable. Therefore, the youth ought to be forced by flagellation or the use of the ban either to marry his bride or to divorce her. This case was already brought before us last year, and we decided in the bride's favor. Because of these reasons, I have agreed to ban and chastise the bridegroom until he either marry his bride on her terms or divorce her. If he refuses to comply with our order he shall bear his sin and those who support him shall likewise suffer. None is excluded from our ban, excepting, of course, our honored teacher Rabbi Meir. Rabbenu Gershom requires that a husband be coerced into divorcing his rebellious wife lest the latter turn to mischief. Although many authorities disagree with Rabbenu Gershom and we do not follow his decision, in cases similar to the one at hand, however, we must protect the daughters of Israel lest unscrupulous youths use the inability and unwillingness of daughters of rich men to change their place of residence, as a means of extorting money from their fathers. Signed: Samuel b. Salomo (Pr. 250).<br>Wailing and complaint that cannot be silenced, arose because of Jacob b. Moses who betrothed the daughter of R. Judah…. The bridegroom may be coerced either to marry the bride on her terms or divorce her. R. Tam decided that a court must compel a levir to marry, or give <i>halitzah</i> to his brother's childless widow, even by the use of force; and that it is even permissible to have Gentiles use force on the levir until he comply with the decision of the Jewish court. Although according to the Jerusalem Talmud whenever the Mishna fails expressly to allow the use of coercion we can use no physical compulsion (Ket. 11, 7), and although the ban is a strong form of coercion, nevertheless, since R. Tam allowed the use of physical compulsion (in a case where the Mishna does not expressly allow the use of such measures, cf. B. Yeb. 39a) we ought to ban the bridegroom until he comply with our decision. Moreover, custom changes law; whenever we are uncertain regarding a certain law, we observe and follow the accepted practice. Thus, the custom is universally accepted of performing the marriage ceremony in the house of the bride's father. Therefore, we invoked against the youth all the curses great and small, until he comply with our decision. Signed Jacob b. Rabbi Joseph (Pr. 251).<br>To our Rabbis of Germany, your love has obliged me to express my opinion regarding the above. Since witnesses testify to the fact that there was a stipulated condition at the time of the betrothal, such condition is binding and the bridegroom must live up to its terms. Even if there are no such witnesses, the fact that his father-in-law kept him in his house together with his teacher, even though he returned home because of illness, proves that the father-in-law intended that the wedding take place in his house. It is difficult to imagine that the latter intended to brave the grave danger of sending his daughter and his money to Germany, which is very unsafe country. Furthermore, a man may not force his wife to leave her country and to come to live in his country. Therefore, we may force the bridegroom to do one of two things: either marry his bride and come to live in her place of residence, or divorce her. The Rabbis ought to coerce him by the use of chastisement and the ban, for fear lest his bride remain a deserted wife. We find many instances where the Rabbis decreed special laws and took extraordinary measures in order to prevent the possibility of a woman remaining a deserted wife. Signed: Yehiel b. Jacob ha Levi (Pr. 251).<br>To my teacher Rabbi Meir. I saw the decision of the judges in the case of the honorable R. Judah of Düren who betrothed his daughter to Jacob b. Moses of Rothenburg. At the time of the betrothal Moses agreed to send his son Jacob to Düren in order that he marry his bride there. Moses kept his agreement and sent his son to R. Judah. But, when the latter saw that Jacob was small in stature, homely, and despicable, he had pity on his daughter. Fearing lest she begin to despise her bridegroom, he sent Jacob back to his father to stay there till he grow up. When the bride grew up and R. Judah was told that Jacob also gained in strength, he sent for the latter to come and marry his bride. However, Moses refused to send Jacob to Düren. As time dragged on and R. Judah's daughter saw that her bridegroom refused to come to her, she sent a messenger to Rothenburg to demand that Jacob either marry her on the conditions previously agreed upon, or divorce her. But Jacob answered that he did not personally agree to move to Düren, that he did not join in his father's agreement on that score, that he would not come to her father's house, and that he would marry her only if she come to Rothenburg. Thereupon it was decided [by R. Meir] that she could not compel Jacob to move to Düren nor force him to divorce her. This decision, however, is very strange, and, in my opinion, is a perversion of justice for a number of reasons. a) Some of our great authorities quote the opinion of R. Tam to the effect that both the Mishna (Ket. 13, 10) and the Tosephta (Ket. 13, 2) which treat of the conditions under which a party to a marriage may be forced to remove to the place of residence of the other party, deal with forcing the husband to move to the place of residence of the wife. Therefore, the conclusion of both sources is that the husband who married a wife living in another country must move to that country. Again, whenever the talmudic sources state that the husband be so forced to move, the implication is that upon refusing to do so he must divorce his wife and pay her the <i>ketubah</i>. Next, it is well known that the bride's home is luxurious and comfortable [for which reason she ought not to be forced to remove to her husband's humble abode], that her traveling to Rothenburg would entail great difficulties and serious hazards since the entire road is infested with lurking dangers, and that her very stay in Rothenburg would be perilous because of her father's great reputation for wealth. Therefore, Jacob cannot force her to take such a step. Besides, even if she wanted to go to Rothenburg, her father's repeated objections would not allow her to do so, and she could do nothing about it. Therefore, this case is similar to the one quoted in the Mishna (Ket. 13, 5), in which case Admon decided that the bride might demand from her bridegroom that he either marry, or divorce her. Finally, Jacob is bound by his father's agreement, since it is customary for the parents of a couple to enter into all agreements governing the marriage, and for such agreements to be considered binding on the couple. Although the principle is accepted that \"the consent of the father does not imply the consent of the son (Kid. 45b)\", this principle applies only to the actual betrothal but not to the other arrangements appertaining thereto. Moreover, the fact that he came to live in Düren proves that he had agreed to his father's arrangement; while his having been sent home temporarily, because of illness, did not invalidate the original agreement.<br>Therefore, it seems to me that the decision cited above was a perversion of justice, or, at least, against common sense, and not in the interest of the public welfare. For were we to accept the principle implied in your decision, the interests of the wealthy would suffer greatly. Thus many unscrupulous persons, knowing that the daughters of the rich cannot move away from their home towns, would betroth such women and then extort money from their fathers by refusing to marry them until either the women move away from their homeland, or their fathers pay exorbitant sums of money. And you, my teacher, R. Meir, how did you come to subscribe to such a decision? Everybody is wondering at this. For R. Judah is ready to fulfill all his previous promises and more; he wants Jacob and the bride also wants him. They are ready to give guarantees that they will not act treacherously against him; and, in case he does not want her, she is ready to accept her divorce and forego her <i>ketubah</i>. In the face of such facts, how can any Rabbi, student, or judge, give heed to those who insidiously demand that R. Judah's daughter come to live in Rothenburg, knowing full well that she can not do so! It is obvious that these persons are only interested in extorting money from R. Judah, and it is not becoming your dignity to uphold the cause of these extortionists. Should we allow an Israelite daughter to become a deserted wife because her father is averse to becoming a victim of extortion? I know that R. Judah did not acquiesce; that he could not bear the idea of being coerced and forced to part with his money; and that he sent inquiries to the elders, the greatest authorities of France, and to other places. It appears that those authorities have all agreed that Jacob ought to be forced to marry his bride on her own terms or to divorce her. Although you are the greatest authority of our generation, you will not find it easy to oppose the decision of our great authorities, lest dissensions multiply in Israel. \"Therefore, leave off contention, before the quarrel break out\" (Proverbs 17,14).

                        "Most scholars hold the opinion that a woman whose husband fell into a body of water whose final boundaries are not discernible, and who, though not permitted to remarry, defiantly transgressed against the prohibition of the Rabbis and did remarry, need not be divorced from her second husband. This opinion they base on the talmudic ruling that the law prohibiting the remarriage of a woman whose husband fell into a \"boundless\" body of water, applies only before, but not after, she has remarried. I once saw a prominent personage of our kingdom remarry under such circumstances without any one admonishing her. All our prominent scholars decided that she need not be divorced, once she has remarried. A great French scholar was then staying in our kingdom, and he, too, permitted her to stay married claiming that he had witnessed a similar case in France and that all the great scholars of France ruled that she need not be divorced. I also gave my consent to his decision though I was hesitant. However, I have finally come to the conclusion that such an opinion is untenable. For, were this opinion correct the prohibition of the Rabbis would be rendered senseless, useless, and ridiculous, since no woman would heed such prohibition and would transgress against it rather than stay single all her life. Why, then, would the Rabbis prohibit such remarriage to begin with! Therefore, we must say that the talmudic ruling which does not require the remarried woman to be divorced, refers only to that woman who remarried because she innocently believed that a scholar had permitted her to do so, as in the case of Hassa (Yeb. 121b) and that of R. Shila (Yeb. 121a); but that it does not refer to the woman who defiantly transgressed the prohibition of the Rabbis. This latter interpretation of the pertinent talmudic sources clarifies the words of the Rabbis and renders them logical and tenable. Therefore, a woman who remarried without receiving permission from a scholar must be divorced, or the husband be put under the ban till he divorce her. We must not be concerned lest a relative of the woman permit her to remarry (thus flouting the prohibition of the Rabbis), for the following reasons: a) only a scholar holding the position among scholars that R. Nahman (the scholar who inadvertantly caused the wife of Hassa to remarry) and R. Shila held in their day, is empowered to permit such a woman to remarry; b) a scholar permitting such a woman to remarry would bring upon himself the ban.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 194; Am II, 97; Mord.

Therefore, this conditional promise for a holy cause should also be void, for, although a mere verbal promise for a holy cause is as valid as an actual delivery (of money and valuables) to a private person, it has no greater validity than such delivery; and any transaction classified as an <i>asmakhta</i> is invalid even if the money and valuables are actually delivered.

I always advise women who receive such conditional divorces to guard their bills of divorcement carefully till their husbands die. Secondly, even according to Rashi, who believes that the divorce becomes effective immediately upon the delivery of the bill of divorcement, if the husband subsequently dies from his illness, the fact that A was walking thereafter without the support of a cane nullified the bill of divorcement.

If A had originally separated himself from the community with the latter's full knowledge and consent, he need not cooperate with the community in the payment of its taxes; but, if he did not obtain the consent of the community, he had no right to make a separate agreement with the overlord since the custom of the community provides that all Jews be partners in the payment of the taxes.

Furthermore, the overlord had no right to make a separate agreement with A in violation of the custom he himself had established among the Jews of his town.

A's objection that it will be prohibitive for him to pay taxes both to the overlord and to the community, is not very serious, for he may explain to the overlord that separating oneself from the community in the payment of taxes is prohibited by our laws, that on this account one becomes involved in quarrels with the Jews of the kingdom, and that henceforth he will refuse to pay his taxes independently of the community.

A summoned the Community of Friedberg to court and put forth his claims as follows: Long<sup>*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The phrase <span>השבעות לפני התפיסה</span> might mean: <span>ה׳ שבועות לפני התפיסה</span> five weeks before the general arrest</i> before the arrest (of the Jews of Friedberg) the members of the community were called upon to pay the (yearly) tax, and each one declared, under sanction of excommunication, the value of his assets. A told the registrars of the declarations that he possessed seventy <i>marks</i>, thirty-seven of his own, and thirty-three that he owed to Gentiles and that were to be repaid immediately; that all his neighbors knew of his obligation immediately to repay that debt; and that he refused to pay taxes for these thirty-three <i>marks</i>. The registrars told A that it was not worth his while to argue about the matter since the tax was so small, only three pennies per <i>mark</i>. A answered that he feared lest the tax-rate later would be increased; but the registrars assured him of their positive conviction that, with God's help, no increase of the tax-rate would be necessary. A, therefore, agreed to pay the tax on the whole amount. Subsequently the community, including A's wife, was arrested. A, however, was in Frankfort at the time, and he escaped to a place called Hunburg. As soon as he arrived there he was seized by the knights, his creditors, for the purpose of collecting the money due them from him before he became penniless. In order to pay off his creditors, A had to call in his investments immediately and thus had to settle with his debtors for much less than what they owed him. A sent his nephew to the fortress, where the Jews of Friedberg were held in custody, to inform them that he was forced to repay his debts and consequently would be able to contribute toward the ransom of the community only from the money he still had left. The community leaders, however, paid no attention to him, taxed him an amount double the value of his present assets, and delivered his wife into the hands of the king's servants with instructions to detain her and punish her till she pay this amount. A was willing to pay the same tax-rate on the money he now possessed, as the other members of the community had paid, but the amount he had been assessed was well beyond his means. He contended that he should not be expected to pay tax on the money he had owed to others, since he had repaid that money before the amount of the ransom (for the community) was agreed upon. Moreover, Rabbi Meborak, the trustee of the community, admitted to A that the custom of the Friedberg community always was for the members to declare their assets yearly under sanction of excommunication and to pay on the feast of <i>Hanukkah</i>, on the basis of such declaration, only the taxes already demanded by that date; while any unforeseen expenses or taxes demanded during the remainder of the year were paid with money borrowed on account of the next year's taxes.<br>The trustee averred: It is a custom long established in Friedberg, a community where great scholars and <i>parnasim</i> (community leaders) have dwelt, that a person pay taxes on the capital he does business with even though a great part of that capital is not his own. A himself has complied with this custom for many years. Now that we have been arrested, wise and discerning men have advised us to use the declarations made before the arrest as a basis for the apportioning of the ransom demanded from us; for, were we to rely on new declarations, since the tax is so excessively high, a few of our members might (by making false declarations) cunningly evade paying their due share.<br>A rejoined: The custom of paying taxes on capital invested with one by other people, applied only as far as ordinary taxes were concerned. But in the case of ruinous robbery such as the present one, when a person is expected to give away everything he has, how can one give that which is not his! Moreover, your decision, to use the former declaration as a basis for levying this tax, was reached without my consent and in spite of my protests. For the purpose of this tax you have evaluated your immovables and your books at half its actual value; an object evaluated at two <i>marks</i> was later sold for four <i>marks</i>. Who gave you the right to make such evaluation?<br>The trustee averred: Immovables and books are customarily exempt from taxation. But. for the advantage of the community, the wealthy among us have consented to pay taxes on immovables and books. They have decided, with the knowledge and consent of the whole community, to assess books at their actual cost, i.e. the cost of the parchment plus the scribe's wages. If this arrangement is displeasing to A, they are willing to revert to the generally accepted custom of paying no taxes on such valuables.<br>A replied: No custom can apply to the present case of ruinous robbery. Moreover, the rich have brought this calamity upon us by their high houses; why, then, should these houses be exempt? A further claimed that when one member of the community was discovered to have transgressed the ban and to have possessed more capital than what he had originally declared, the community confiscated that excess and distributed it proportionately among the tax-payers; and that one rich tax-payer promised to give his part of that excess to A in order to help him ransom his wife. That part amounted to sixteen <i>marks</i>, and A demanded that sum. The trustee answered that he did not consult the tax-payer referred to, but that he was sure that the latter would either deny having made such a promise, or would say that he had changed his mind.<br>Signed: Asher b. Rabbi Yehiel; Yehiel b. Isaak; Joseph b. Nathan.<br>A further claims that the community leaders have foregone part of the tax of some members, which in some cases amounted to as much as one hundred <i>marks</i> and in others to sixty <i>marks</i>, in order that these members might agree to the manner of apportioning the tax, while from A they demand that which he does not possess."

                        "Also, please instruct us regarding the laws governing the taxation of immovables and books; for I remember what you told us regarding the Mishna, Peah, 8, 9, and the <i>Yerushalmi</i> thereto, that you derived from these sources the rule that immovables be assessed at one quarter their value. Books, I believe, should not be taxed at all; if those who study the books are exempt from taxation, the books themselves ought to be similarly exempt. The Torah is termed \"freedom\" and ought to be free from the yoke of government. Moreover, house utensils are not taxed. Sometimes a person has many sets of such utensils, which are used only on rare occasions, yet he pays no taxes thereon. How much more reason to exempt books that are used daily by a person or by his sons and sons-in-law, or are lent to others for the purpose of study.",
                        "<i>A</i>. Why did you inquire of me concerning matters of taxation which are rooted in local custom, each community being governed by its own customs? The Talmud states that a person may withdraw from a partnership without the consent of the other partners when each person is attacked by a band of robbers and thus may suffer a loss of money (B. K. 116b). Therefore, if the Jews of Friedberg were accustomed to be partners in payment of normal taxes only, A had a right to withdraw from the partnership with reference to the exorbitant tax which constituted outright robbery. The rule, \"the law of the land prevails\", does not apply to extraordinary taxation, the latter being considered outright robbery. Therefore, since A warned the community to include him in their settlement with the authorities only if he was to bear the burden of the ensuing tax in proportion to the money he had left after paying his debts, the leaders of the community had no right to include him in their settlement unless they agreed to his terms. They should have excluded A's wife from their settlement with the authorities. However if such exclusion of A's wife might have led to her being abused and defiled by the uncircumcised — for a report reached us of the Jews of Friedberg having been threatened that unless they speedily come to terms with their captors their wives would be outraged and defiled — the leaders of the community were justified in including her in the general settlement in spite of A's protests. A Jew should be ransomed and delivered out of the hands of Gentiles even against his express will, and should be charged with the expenses incurred. Moreover, if the Jews of Friedberg were accustomed to be partners even in the payment of exorbitant taxes — for the custom in these kingdoms has been for a long time that there were no normal taxes, and every overlord levied taxes to his heart's content — the mere fact that the tax was more exorbitant than the others did not give A the right to withdraw from the partnership. Every tax levied by the overlord must be borne proportionately by all the Jews of the community. Even though A warned the leaders not to include him in the general agreement, except on his terms, his warning was of no avail as long as the leaders did what they thought the right thing. Since in the opinion of the latter it was better to come to terms with the government instead of passively revolting against it, A was bound by the act of these leaders and must contribute his share in proportion to the capital he possessed at the time of the arrest. The fact that he was later forced to repay his debts did not diminish his obligation; for this obligation was not created at the time the agreement was reached with the authorities, but it was created at the time of the arrest, and at that time he still possessed seventy <i>marks</i>. A's complaint that some of the members of the community evaluated their immovables and books at less than their actual value, is irrelevant, for the community members have done him a favor by paying a tax on such valuables. Had they refused to pay such tax, no court would have compelled them to pay it. Already in former generations, many persons had complained bitterly before the courts and had demanded that immovables and books be taxed, especially when exorbitant taxes were demanded by the authorities — taxes that took away nine tenths of one's capital — but the owners of immovables and books were always acquitted in accordance with a long established custom instituted by the \"ancients\" [early settlers of Germany and France]. Since many good reasons, as well as the interests of public welfare, support the decision that immovables are not taxable, no court can override the decision of the other courts in this matter, unless the people of your community originally unanimously adopted a different ruling, for a community may change an established custom by a unanimous vote only. Regarding the alleged promise of the rich tax-payer to A, I have little to say as long as the promisor keeps silent. In any case, since the promise was not made formally, the promisor has a right to change his mind at any time. However, A's complaint that the community leaders have foregone certain obligations of some members, is a serious complaint since the leaders have no right to forego A's part of such tax obligations without his consent.

                        "<i>Q</i>. C gave a pledge to the community treasurers, the collectors of the tax, as security for his share of that tax. The treasurers, however, later lost that pledge (apparently through no fault of theirs). Must C pay his share of the tax?<br><i>A</i>. Since the overlord keeps the community responsible for the deficiency caused by the loss of C's pledge, the community is collectively held responsible for the entire tax (each individual, therefore, is responsible to the community and not to the overlord). Since C gave the pledge to the representative of the community, and it was lost while in the latter's possession, C is free from obligation. Therefore, the whole community must make up the deficiency. We can not compare this case to that of the man who betrothed a woman with a pledge (Kidd. 8b), and conclude that since the pledge was given as security only and did not constitute actual payment, that C did not as yet discharge his obligation; for the community is not obliged to pay the overlord actual cash, but may pay its tax in valuables as well as in cash. Thus the custom is that when a person gives a pledge to the community treasurer (and then fails to redeem it) the pledge is not sold but is handed over intact to the overlord's messenger, when the latter comes to demand the tax-money, in payment of that person's share of the tax, whether the pledge be worth much more than, or exactly as much as, that share of the tax. Therefore, whether a person pays cash or gives a pledge, makes no difference to the community. The second case you ask about, is exactly similar to the first. As soon as a person hands over his payment to the treasurer of the community, he is free from obligation. However, such payment must actually be made to the treasurer; mere setting aside of valuables as payment for taxes, is not sufficient.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am II, 139."

A was discovered to have transgressed this decree.<br><i>A</i>. If A was a resident of T when the aforesaid ordinance was passed, whether he supported the measure, accepted it tacitly, or openly protested against it, he is bound by it even though he subsequently moved out of T. For a person's protests against an ordinance designed for the public benefit and passed by a majority vote of the worthy members of the community are of no avail. Thus the ordinance of Rabbenu Gershom reads as follows: \"If the residents of a city have established an ordinance for the benefit of the community, for the benefit of the poor, or for any other useful purpose, and most of the worthy ones have agreed to it, the others may not void such ordinance and may not demand to take the matter to court, for no court may sit in such a case, because everything depends on the opinion of the prominent men of the city, in accordance with the custom of the ancients, or as an emergency measure.\"<br>If A, however, moved out of T before the ordinance was passed, he is to be governed only by talmudic law and by customs generally accepted by the communities, while any restrictive measure adopted by the community of T after A moved out is not binding on him. A community may force a dissenting minority and all those who subsequently come to settle in the town, to accept its decrees and ordinances. But a community possesses no authority over a person who moved out of town before the decrees and ordinances were passed, and who does not live there any longer. Therefore, if A had had ample opportunity, since he left T, to force his debtors to replay their debts to him, and failed to do so, he must pay the community taxes on such debts. But if he was unable to collect these debts, the custom is well established in all communities not to tax such debts. Any local ordinance in opposition to such custom is not binding on a non-resident who was a non-resident at the time the ordinance was passed. But, if the community representatives claim that A has had ample opportunity to force collection of his debts, and A denies such claim, the latter must take an oath to bolster his denial.<br>This responsum is addressed to \"my relative Kohen Zedek.\"<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am II, 140; <i>Mordecai Hagadol</i>, p. 300a."

A is to be held responsible for the loss of the ten pounds through his messenger and the loss of the sixty-one <i>marks</i>, only if such losses had occurred before B joined A \"in his work\"; otherwise A can not be held responsible even for wilful neglect, since a bailee is not responsible for losses caused by wilful neglect, if such losses occurred while the owner was with him \"in his work.\"<br>The matter was again sent to R.

If not for this act of A, he, B, would have earned thirty pounds. A denied B's claim. h) B claimed that towards the end [of their business venture] they had been offered six pounds for the coin [probably the coin-matrix], but that A did not permit him to sell it for that price, while refusing to buy it himself, and thus they lost the six pounds. i) B claimed that C and the \"officers\" [probably the officers of the mint] owed money to the partnership, but that A refused to collect this money. j) A claimed that the sixty-one <i>marks</i> allegedly missing from the partnership money, really represented the payment he had made to the \"treasurers\" in order to free his partners from their obligations to them. He demanded, therefore, that B pay his share of this payment. B stating that the \"treasurers\" depended on him for the repayment of his obligation, denied A's claim and said that A did not go surety for him and was, therefore, not required to pay B's obligation. B further claimed that the above-mentioned money was actually lost because A put it in the custody of his young children. A's youngest child, however, is fifteen years of age.<br><i>A</i>. f) If B takes an oath to the effect that he repaid the forty pounds to A, the partners may hold A responsible for these forty pounds. But if A subsequently takes an oath to the effect that B did not repay the forty pounds, A will be free from obligation to his partners regarding that sum. g) A must take an oath to support his claim. However, if at any time B had shown satisfaction with C's being admitted to the partnership, A's oath is unnecessary. h) Since A did not allow B to sell the coin [matrix] for six pounds hoping to sell it later for more, he can not be held responsible merely because his expectations were not realized. j) Since the money belongs to the partnership, B can sue C and the \"officers\" directly because of the \"lien of R. Nathan\" (garnishment). But, if the \"officers\" are Gentiles and the law of the land does not recognize the validity of the law of garnishment, A must institute proceedings against the \"officers.\" k) I have already written to you that A is not to be held responsible even for losses occasioned by wilful neglect since B was with him \"in his work.\" Moreover, since A's youngest child is fifteen years of age, the putting of money in the custody of his wife and children cannot be considered wilful neglect, since a bailee is expected to deliver his bailment into the hands of his wife and grown up children (B.M. 36a). If the partners, however, have not as yet divided the partnership money among themselves, B may exact an oath from A's children (but not from his wife until she be widowed or divorced) to the effect that they have not misappropriated any of the partnership money. He may exact this oath because of \"the lien of R. Nathan.\" Regarding A's claim to have paid B's obligations to the \"treasurers\", B is free from obligation for that sum; for a person who repays the debt of another has no claim on the latter.

Moreover, even if there were no such witnesses, we would have put no credence in B's assertion that he provided A with a surety only because he acted \"inside the line of justice.\" For the principle of <i>Miggo</i> — that we ought to believe B's present statement since, were he inclined to lie, he could have denied altogether having provided A with a surety — does not apply to this case, since we are thoroughly convinced that had B not owed the money to A, he would not have repaid part of it.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 166; Am II, 164."

                        "<i>Q</i>. A summoned B, the brother of his wife L, to court. A claimed that his wife, L, who took part in managing his business, had transferred to her brother, B, a debt of four pounds of coins due her from C; that in B's presence L told C to pay his debt to B, and that the latter would be under obligation to repay to her that money as well as half of the profit he (B) would earn therewith; that L released C from obligation to her because B had undertaken to be responsible for the money; that C promised by solemn hand-clasp to repay his debt to B, and that the latter consequently promised L by solemn hand-clasp to repay her the money and half of his profit therefrom; and that L permitted B to retain for himself the chickens he might receive from his Gentile debtors as presents.<sup>*</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Cf. Hagahot Maimuniot</i>, Constantinople edition, to <i>Hilkot Malveh</i>, chap. 9: <span>אם המקבל לוקח עצמו הדורונות שמביאין הנוים כשבאים לפדות את משכנותיהן בהא נראה דסגי בשכר עמלו</span>. Thus Gentile debtors used to bring presents to their creditors, when they came to redeem their pledges.</i><br>B averred that L had stealthily taken the four pounds from A and had lent them to C; that she acted stealthily because she was afraid of her husband; that subsequently she encountered difficulty in collecting the money from C who had no money with which to repay her; that consequently she asked B to collect the money for her; that he, B, obligated himself to pay L the principal plus half the profit he might earn therewith, should he succeed in collecting the money from C; that his obligation to L was not to begin till C repaid his debt; and that C never paid him the money. B further claimed that he had not in C's presence provided L with sureties for the debt nor came to an agreement with her regarding the conditions of the transaction; but that L merely told C to repay his debt to B, without any further qualification; that when he subsequently came to demand the money from C, the latter asked him for an extension of the loan for four weeks; that L advised him to grant C that extension; that in all his dealings with C he consulted L and followed her instructions; that he reminded L repeatedly that his obligation toward her would not begin till C repay his debt, and that she invariably agreed with him.<br>The trustee appointed by L confirmed (in her name) A's claims and denied those of B. The trustee further claimed that L had stipulated in her agreement with B that he invest her money only against pledges, and that B violated this agreement by granting C an extension. Does the granting of permission to the active partner to receive gifts from the prospective Gentile debtors legitimize the aforesaid seemingly usurious transaction (for the plaintiff thinks that such stipulation does legitimatize the transaction) according to which B was to be responsible for the entire principal and was also expected to share the profits with L?<br><i>A</i>. If L released C because B took over C's obligation and told L to release C, B's responsibility was that of a surety who guaranteed a loan at the time it was consumated, and was, therefore, responsible even if his act was not accompanied by a <i>kinyan</i>. But, if L merely told C to pay his debt to B, the latter is not responsible for the debt, even if he did not expressly stipulate the condition that his responsibility begin only after C had repaid his debt. Although L claims that B promised by solemn hand-clasp to go surety for C, since B denies this claim he is free from obligation and is not required to take an oath. Had B made such promise by solemn hand-clasp, we would compel him to carry out his promise. However, we impose no oath on a person who denies having promised by solemn hand-clasp, when such a person would be under no obligation to the alleged promisee if he truly made no promise by solemn hand-clasp. Therefore, if B take an oath to the effect that L did not release C because of B's promise, or that he, B, had expressly stipulated the condition that he was not to become obligated till C has repaid his debt, he would be free from obligation. B's alleged solemn hand-clasp, however, does not take the place of such oath. Since aside from that hand-clasp, B would have been under obligation to L if her other claims were true, such a hand-clasp does not take the place of a judicial oath administered while holding the Scroll of the Law.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am II, 165; Sinai VII (1943), 5–6, 53; <i>Mordecai Hagadol</i>, p. 361a."

Subsequently, A wanted to sell his part, but B objected. The case was brought before R. Meir who sustained B's objection. Now B is seeking to sell his half and also his right to a fixed rental for the other half. A, however, objects to a sale by B of the right to a fixed rental claiming that he had originally leased his half to B for a low rental in order that B and his family live therein and enjoy it themselves, but not for the purpose of selling it to another. Is A's objection valid? Also, please note that A's daughter, B's wife, was dead, but the children she bore to A are living; does the fact that B's wife is dead prejudice B's rights? Moreover, B claims, and witnesses support his claim, that the agreement of lease was reached between A and B after a sharp quarrel which followed their buying of the property. Thus the lease was not a gift of love [in which case the purpose of the gift must be taken into consideration], but was rather the outcome of litigation and compromise and was, therefore, of the nature of a sale. B further states that should A's objection be sustained in court, he would sell his own half of the house and would dwell in the other half, or would rent out the latter half and would use the rent for his sustenance. Please further inform me, on the other side of this sheet, as to what was done in the case of the widow from Spiers and her two Levite levirs. Signed: Asher b. Rabbi Yehiel.<br><i>A</i>. We are not to take into consideration A's purpose in leasing his half of the house to B, for various reasons. a) When B sells his right to a fixed rental to a third party, he benefits from such sale as much as he would have benefited from living in the house himself. b) Since B has lived in the rented half of the house for a long time, the transaction of the lease is by now complete so that A's original purpose in leasing it is no longer of any consequence. c) A transaction of sale, lease, or even gift, is concluded by two parties, being the result of a meeting of both minds and, therefore, such transaction is not conditioned by the special purpose or intent of one party when such purpose or intent was not in the mind of the other party. Therefore, even if B had no surviving children from A's daughter, the validity of the lease would not have been affected. d) According to your letter, the lease was not motivated by feelings of kindliness, but was a purely business transaction.

After the sale was completed and the title conveyed, B pressed his rights as an abutter. Since Maimonides rules that the law of preemption does not apply to the case where a person exchanges his immovables for the immovables of another, C was advised to persuade A to refuse to accept from B, in payment of A's ground, anything but the particular piece of ground A was to receive from C. Accordingly A claimed that C's piece of ground was very precious to him and that he valued it like the \"estate of Bar Marion\" (B.B. 12b). B, therefore, bought from D his share of the particular ground he held in partnership with C, and offered it to A in lieu of C's share of the same ground. C, however, objected to D's sale claiming that upon the voiding of his transaction with A he would return to his former status as D's partner, and, having the right of preemption on D's share, he would buy such share leaving nothing to A. A and C employed many other tricks and artifices in order to void B's right of preemption.<br><i>A</i>. Since C bought A's ground and gave away his own ground in partial payment thereof, he no longer owns the latter ground. Since a person who buys real property desired by an abutter, merely acts as the agent of such abutter (B.B. 108a), C must deliver to B the ground he bought from A, receiving in exchange the ground B bought from D plus a refund of his money. Were B unable to acquire such ground from D, he would have repaid C with money for the ground C gave to A; the value of such ground would have been determined by experts and not by C. C would not have been able to claim that his ground was very precious to him having for him the value of the \"estate of Bar Marion\", for such claim is valid only when a person is seeking to take away the property of another (in exchange of his own) against the will of the latter who may plead that his property is very precious to him. But in our case C has sold his property to A, and is only entitled to its market price. Moreover, even if the aforementioned sale were not concluded as yet, and an understanding merely existed between A and C that C convey his ground to A on condition that the conveyance of A's ground be without any interference on the part of the abutters, A could not have insisted on exchanging his ground for ground exactly similar to that of C. A could not have attached special importance to C's ground as having the value for him of the \"estate of Bar Marion\", for the reason already stated. Therefore, B would have been able to pay A with other ground, located in the same town, of equal value as that of C.

                        "<i>Q</i>. A sold his ground, which bordered on B's property, to C for a sum of money plus C's share in a piece of ground C held in partnership with D in another part of town. After the sale was completed and the title conveyed, B pressed his rights as an abutter. Since Maimonides rules that the law of preemption does not apply to the case where a person exchanges his immovables for the immovables of another, C was advised to persuade A to refuse to accept from B, in payment of A's ground, anything but the particular piece of ground A was to receive from C. Accordingly A claimed that C's piece of ground was very precious to him and that he valued it like the \"estate of Bar Marion\" (B.B. 12b). B, therefore, bought from D his share of the particular ground he held in partnership with C, and offered it to A in lieu of C's share of the same ground. C, however, objected to D's sale claiming that upon the voiding of his transaction with A he would return to his former status as D's partner, and, having the right of preemption on D's share, he would buy such share leaving nothing to A. A and C employed many other tricks and artifices in order to void B's right of preemption.<br><i>A</i>. Since C bought A's ground and gave away his own ground in partial payment thereof, he no longer owns the latter ground. Since a person who buys real property desired by an abutter, merely acts as the agent of such abutter (B.B. 108a), C must deliver to B the ground he bought from A, receiving in exchange the ground B bought from D plus a refund of his money. Were B unable to acquire such ground from D, he would have repaid C with money for the ground C gave to A; the value of such ground would have been determined by experts and not by C. C would not have been able to claim that his ground was very precious to him having for him the value of the \"estate of Bar Marion\", for such claim is valid only when a person is seeking to take away the property of another (in exchange of his own) against the will of the latter who may plead that his property is very precious to him. But in our case C has sold his property to A, and is only entitled to its market price. Moreover, even if the aforementioned sale were not concluded as yet, and an understanding merely existed between A and C that C convey his ground to A on condition that the conveyance of A's ground be without any interference on the part of the abutters, A could not have insisted on exchanging his ground for ground exactly similar to that of C. A could not have attached special importance to C's ground as having the value for him of the \"estate of Bar Marion\", for the reason already stated. Therefore, B would have been able to pay A with other ground, located in the same town, of equal value as that of C. Many persons have the erroneous notion that the preemptive right of an abutter is void whenever an exchange or real property is involved. Were this true, the parties to a sale of immovables would always add a small piece of ground to the purchasing price in order to place the transaction in the category of exchange of real property, thus turning into a hollow mockery the ordinance of the Rabbis who created the law of preemption for humane reasons.

A claims that certain commentaries to the tractate <i>Yebamot</i> were once lent to B's father, to A's brother, and to himself; that when these commetaries were lost (or stolen) the three borrowers were required to compensate the lender to the extent of one pound; that his brother and he, A, paid two thirds of this compensation; that after B's father died, B found (or recovered) the commentaries; and that in A's presence, B evaluated them at one pound upon delivering them to his creditor. A, therefore, demands from B two thirds of a pound, for his brother and himself. B avers that he has no knowledge of A's having paid anything for the commentaries; that he received them as part of his father's estate; that he was answerable for only half of their value since he shared the estate with his brother; that he kept them for a period of three years without any protest on A's part; and that even if he were forced by the court to pay A for his alleged share in the commentaries, he would pay such share of their present, depreciated, value only. A rejoins that he holds B responsible for the entire sum, since he found the commentaries in B's possession; and that he learned only recently that they were in B's possession. B further claims that in order to retrieve the commentaries he paid (the thief) more than their actual value; and that he gave them to his creditor in A's presence without any protest on A's part. A avers that he has no knowledge of B's having paid anything for the commentaries; that B should not have paid anything for them, since they would have been returned at no cost, and that the reason for his failing to protest against B's delivering them to his creditor, was that he sought to discover at what price B would evaluate them. Signed: Nethanel b. Nahman, Ephraim b. Ephraim.<br><i>A</i>. If A claims that B knows that A and his brother paid two thirds of a pound when the commentaries were lost, B must take an oath denying such knowledge and be free from obligation. But, if A is not positive in his claim, B is not required to take an oath. A general ban should be pronounced against anyone (including B) who knows anything about this matter and does not report it to the court. If, however, B admits A's claim, but claims to have spent money in retrieving the commentaries, he is entitled to a refund of his expenses. If, however, he paid such money to the thief himself, he is entitled to no refund. Thus, one who buys a stolen object from a person known to be a thief is not entitled to a refund of expenses; he who buys an object from a thief knowing definitely it to be a stolen object, is surely not entitled to a refund. A did not lose his rights by failing to protest against B's delivering the commentaries to his creditor; and he is entitled to receive his share of the amount they were evaluated at, when so delivered.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am II, 209."

Rashi, in his interpretation of the talmudic statement of Menahot 6b (s. v. <span>וכי תימא</span>), implies that after Aaron was appointed to the priesthood non-priests were excluded from serving even at high-places. How, then, did Manoah and Samuel personally offer up sacrifices on high-places? Moreover, [Midrash] Shoher Tob states that Samuel was guilty of three transgressions in making his burnt offering: a) he had no right to act as priest, b) he made the offering at the wrong time, and c) he made the offering on a high-place. The last statement thus supports Rashi's opinion.<br><i>A</i>. The aforesaid opinion of Rashi was refuted by the Tosaphot (Manahot 6b, s. v. <span>וכי תימא</span>) who cited as proof the priestly activities of Samuel and Saul, and the explicit talmudic statement in Zebahim 118a. However, although non-priests were permitted to act as priests in offering up sacrifices on high-places, Levites were never permitted to do the work of priests (Erekin, 11b).

                    "<i>Q</i>. A prominent burgher, a violent man, told A and B that he would take over the obligation of a debtor of theirs, since he himself owed money to this debtor. He invited them to his house in order to give them pledges as security for such debt. When they came to his house he placed pieces of cloth before them. A picked out one piece of cloth, twelve cubits in length, and said that he would like to have it for a Sabbath outfit. The Gentile sold it to him for two <i>marks</i> and deducted that sum from the debt. B then told A that he thus owed him one <i>mark</i>; but A objected to this claim saying that he took the cloth only because he wanted to withdraw his money from the Gentile, that he intended to keep the two <i>marks</i> for himself, and to even the score, he advised B also to buy a similar garment from the Gentile. B refused to buy it. The Gentile, then, gave them the rest of the cloth as security and they departed. Subsequently they returned the cloth in exchange for other pledges; they also held the Gentile's pledges for other debts contracted at various times. All in all, however, the pledges were worth much less than the debts and were never redeemed. Four years later the Gentile died and the pledges lapsed. Now, B demands that he be permitted to take two <i>marks</i> out of the pledges, and the remainder be equally divided between the partners; while A demands that the two partners bear the loss in proportion to the money that was due each.<br><i>A</i>. Since the burgher was a violent man, A had a right to collect part of his debt independently of B. A had bought the garment for himself, had taken legal possession thereof from the Gentile, therefore, it belonged exclusively to him. Thus his share in the partnership was diminished by two <i>marks</i>, and he must now bear a smaller share of the loss; for the loss must be borne by each partner in proportion to his investment.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: B. p. 277, no. 60."

                    "<i>Q</i>. A negotiated to buy from a Gentile a house which bordered on B's property. After A agreed with the Gentile on the terms of the sale, he withdrew his offer so that the Gentile should lower his price. He warned B not to negotiate with the Gentile since he, A, was still negotiating with him. B, however, disregarded A's warning and bought the house from the Gentile. In defense B claims that he had sought to purchase the house from the Gentile before A began his negotiations. Should B be punished for his act as violating the talmudic injunction against \"a poor man turning a cake, and another coming and taking it (Kidd. 59a)?\" How long should one refrain from offering to purchase an article which another Jew is seeking to buy?<br><i>A</i>. R. Jacob Tam applies the aforesaid talmudic injunction only to mercantile pursuits but not to cases where a person is about to pick up a lost or ownerless object and another snatches it away. For finding a lost object is a rare opportunity and the second person is just as much entitled to the ownerless object as the first person. Buying abutting property from a Gentile is also a rare opportunity and is in the same category as picking up lost objects. Therefore, B is free from any obligation to A. A Jew should not approach a seller where another Jew had already agreed with the seller for the sale of the article, and where the writing of the contract and the scrutiny and transfer of the deed in the Gentile courts are the only things lacking in order to complete the sale. But, the mere offer of a Jew to buy something without the seller's acceptance of the offer, does not restrain another Jew from buying it. If such were the case, it would be very unfair to the seller who would be forced to sell his possessions to the very first bidder, no matter how low the offer, since no other purchasers would dare to buy it. The Torah was very careful, however, not to jeopardize the rights and opportunities of the sellers.<br>The author claims that the same question was sent to him from Neustadt.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 276–7; Pr. 1011; Berl. p. 284 no. 334; B. p. 292, no. 366."

When B went out of town, the officer of the town stationed guards at his house in order to make sure that neither his wife, his children, nor his valuables would be removed from town. Three days later B's wife came to A and implored him to go surety for her to the officer, and to guaranty that neither she, her children, nor their valuables would be removed from town, until her husband returned and personally gave security to the officer that he would not move out of the overlord's territory. When subsequently B returned to town, A told him of his suretyship. B thanked A and commended him for having kept the guards out of his house. Then the overlord of the town, the king's highest officer, came and heaped accusations on B for having gone to dwell in another town — though this town was also a royal town and, therefore, under his jurisdiction — saying: \"I know that you intend to flee from my territory\". B, realizing that the officer had falsely accused him before the overlord, asked the dignitaries of two towns to induce the overlord to permit him to move into another town under his jurisdiction. When permission was granted, A's relative informed him that B was planning to move out of the overlord's territory. A protested to B's wife that he would be held responsible by the officer for such a move on B's part. B's wife reminded him that the overlord released B's sureties from obligation, but A pointed out that he had gone surety to the officer, and that the latter did not release him. B's wife, therefore, vowed and obligated herself by solemn hand clasp that in case the officer should inculpate A, and in case B should not compensate him for all ensuing losses, she would herself compensate him, up to twenty pounds, out of her clothes and jewels, without a court action. Subsequently B moved out of town, A was inculpated and incarcerated, and was forced to pay thirty pounds for his release. A, therefore, demands the thirty pounds from B.<br><i>A</i>. A husband must redeem his wife even when the ransom asked is larger than her value (as a slave), and must pay his wife's debts which she contracted, for the purpose of buying her release. A person who goes surety for another must be compensated for all ensuing losses. Consequently, B must compensate A for his losses.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: B. P. 286, no. 348. Cf. <i>Agudah</i> B.

After A agreed with the Gentile on the terms of the sale, he withdrew his offer so that the Gentile should lower his price. He warned B not to negotiate with the Gentile since he, A, was still negotiating with him. B, however, disregarded A's warning and bought the house from the Gentile. In defense B claims that he had sought to purchase the house from the Gentile before A began his negotiations.

R. Jacob Tam applies the aforesaid talmudic injunction only to mercantile pursuits but not to cases where a person is about to pick up a lost or ownerless object and another snatches it away. For finding a lost object is a rare opportunity and the second person is just as much entitled to the ownerless object as the first person. Buying abutting property from a Gentile is also a rare opportunity and is in the same category as picking up lost objects. Therefore, B is free from any obligation to A. A Jew should not approach a seller where another Jew had already agreed with the seller for the sale of the article, and where the writing of the contract and the scrutiny and transfer of the deed in the Gentile courts are the only things lacking in order to complete the sale. But, the mere offer of a Jew to buy something without the seller's acceptance of the offer, does not restrain another Jew from buying it. If such were the case, it would be very unfair to the seller who would be forced to sell his possessions to the very first bidder, no matter how low the offer, since no other purchasers would dare to buy it.
