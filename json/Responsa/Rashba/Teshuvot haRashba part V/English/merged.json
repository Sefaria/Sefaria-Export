            "To the wise, complete person: You asked, \"What are blessings? The term 'berachah[blessing]' ‎refers to increased good, but what can a servant add to his Master?\" In truth, the word \"berachah\" ‎is an expression of increase and multiplication, like the expression, \"springs [bereichot] of water\". ‎There is a deep secret regarding berachot, and one to whom G-d has granted knowledge of the ‎secrets of the Torah will understand it. Blessings, and the increase of blessings, multiply in two ‎ways, sometimes from the recipient and sometimes from the giver and conveyor of blessing. This ‎may be compared to a king who gives an showers of his good upon his servants. The blessing ‎appears to his servants in their multiplication and increase, for they were lacking and now they ‎have been made full. However, for the king, it is well known that possesses as much as he has ‎given and used to benefit others, and so the increase and multiplication is not seen in him. Still, if ‎the king were to constantly give, supplying large gifts to his many forces without interruption, it ‎would truly appears that he is blessed [i.e. increased and multiplied], such that he never stops ‎providing for his forces, even for an instant ...  ‎It’s not that the king is made greater by an external source, receiving blessing and abundance from ‎someone greater than he is, who supplied him. Rather, everyone \"blesses\" the king, meaning that ‎they give blessing and thanks that he is the master of these blessings, and his storehouses will ‎never fail. When he adds more good, more people recognize and know him, for his blessing has ‎neither limit nor end … This is the matter of blessings, that we give thanks before Him for the food ‎that He provides, and for the good that He gives to us. We pray that He constantly give blessing, so ‎that everyone will know that He is blessed. As we say: Blessed, and blessed in the mouths of every ‎soul … Also, G-d wants his righteous ones to pray before Him, in order to increase His good for‏ ‏His ‎creations, and in order that their sins not‎‏ ‏cause G-d to withhold His good from them. Thus the ‎Sages taught (Berachot7a), \"G-d said to Yishmael: My son, bless Me. He answered, 'May it be your ‎will that Your mercy should conquer Your anger, and Your mercy should overtake Your [other] ‎attributes, and You should deal with Your children beyond the line of the law.'\"‎"
