            "...And behold, it seems to me in my humble opinion, that the reasoning of the rabbis: that even though our general principle is that there is nothing that stands in front of saving a life, and one does not follow the majority in matters involving saving a life (even if there is the slightest concern that the life of a Jew may be in danger, one takes all steps necessary to save him) - this applies specifically in cases where there is a clear and certain threat to life in front of us, like when a pile of stones have fallen upon someone, that then we are concerned even for the smallest minority of cases [to violate a prohibition to save a life], but in a moment where where is no threat to one's life (i.e. no obligation to save a life) but rather a concern that there would be a danger later on, we follow the majority, for if it were not so, how could it be permitted to go swimming or to go to the desert - places where one must thank God for being saved - and how could it be permitted to, at the outset, enter a dangerous situation and violate the commandment to protect our lives? Rather we must say that, since at that time, there is no imminent danger, we go according to the majority..."
