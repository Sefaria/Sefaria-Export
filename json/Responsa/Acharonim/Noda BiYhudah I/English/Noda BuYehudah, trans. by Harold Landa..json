                "Responsum One of the <i>Noda B’Y’huda</i> First Edition on <i>Orakh Khayim</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is his first Responsa; not on O”H 1!</i><br>‘To hear the Ram’s Horn, may his peaceful life never be torn, In the book of life may he merit to be signed, sealed and borne!’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I know…I took liberties with the translation: The Ram’s horn is a reference to <i>Rosh Hashana</i> and its traditional<i> mitzvot</i> (hearing the Shofar) and prayers, as this missive was likely sent around this time of year. May his ‘covenant of peace not be voided may he be signed and sealed with all who are written in the book of life- a common theme in the prayers of <i>Rosh Hashana</i>.</i> (to) The great scholar, my respected and beloved relative, my dear friend who is a great light and amazing and wonderful in all levels of Torah, and in all levels of honor, our teacher, the Rabbi <i>Yitkhaq HaKohain</i>- may the merciful one watch over him and redeem him- the chief of the Jewish court and head of the Academy of the holy congregation of Bonn. I saw his letter as a ‘flying scroll’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a reference to Zecharya 5:1-2 to the prophet’s vision of a flying scroll, to which the rabbis, in Talmud Bavli Gittin 60a-b imply to mean a scroll of Torah.</i>, as he is a <i>Kohain</i> - whose knowledge is beautiful and whose words are pure- concerning phylacteries that came to a certain scribe who wished to make outstandingly beautiful boxes<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lit. ‘houses’. This is an abbreviated version, as more details of the question will be elaborate later on.</i> for them.",
                "Indeed, they are made with a plaster, which was plastered on with a thick coat on the leather boxes on which, afterwards, mineral spirits<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These ‘spirits’ are the aromatic hydrocarbons like turpentine</i> are applied, such that the boxes are a ‘brilliantly declared’ black- which his eminence plans to disqualify<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">At this point, the relevant source for the production of the <i>tfillin</i> boxes are from Menachot 35 where the Talmud relates that many of the specific laws regarding <i>Tefillin</i> are <i>halacha le-Moshe mi-Sinai</i> – an ‘ancient law of Mosaic tradition’. For example:<br>Rav Chananel quotes Rav as teaching that the need for a base for the square <i>Tefillin</i>, called the <i>titura</i>, is a <i>halacha le-Moshe mi-Sinai</i>.<br>Abayye teaches that the hollow area through which the strap of the <i>Tefillin</i> is pulled, called the <i>ma’abarta</i>, is <i>halacha le-Moshe mi-Sinai</i><br>Similarly, Abayye teaches that the letter <i>shin</i>, formed in the leather or the <i>Tefillin shel rosh – Tefillin</i> worn on the head – is <i>halacha le-Moshe mi-Sinai.</i><br>Rabbi Yitzhak teaches that the rule requiring the leather straps of the <i>Tefillin</i> to be black is a <i>halacha le-Moshe mi-Sinai.</i><br>A <i>baraita</i> (extra-Mishnaic teaching) is quoted as teaching that the requirement that <i>Tefillin</i> must be square is a <i>halacha le-Moshe mi-Sinai.</i><br>Each tefillah, it must be remembered, is in the form of a square leather box upon a base, that of the hand consisting of one compartment and of the head of four compartments. In order to obtain the necessary shape (usually in the form of a cube) a mould or frame is used over which the skin whilst moist and pliable is tautly stretched. On being removed from the frame the skin is cut around to an equal length on three sides, whilst on the fourth side there is left a long strip of skin which, after allowing for a projection on this fourth side in order to provide a loop or a duct through which the straps are passed, is bent under the whole box so as to form the underside or the base of the tefillah. After inserting the necessary texts into the several compartments, the base is stitched carefully to the extremities of the box on three sides The stitching of the underside to the box must be done very carefully so that the box should remain a perfect square; thus the stitches should not be pulled too much for fear that the leather will become creased and so lose its correct shape [see appendix].</i>.",
                "He comes (to this conclusion) from several sides: Firstly, this plaster covers the leather of the [<i>tfillin</i>] boxes! If so, these boxes are not exposed to the outside. Also, from the aspect of ‘adding’, as this plaster is an extra, and one is violating ‘You shall not add [nor detract]’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Based on Deuteronomy 13:1 one may not add nor detract from the commandments – specifically the ritual ones- such as having 5 or 3 fringes of <i>tzitzit</i> instead of the mandated 4.</i>",
                " Additionally, when this plaster was plastered on thickly, it covered the corners of the letter <i>shin</i> on the <i>tfillin</i> box sides, as only the edges are noticed and there may be an aspect of erasing Hashem’s name.",
                " He also wrote to support his reasoning that they are disqualified because the leather is covered, which would not be beneficial<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">From the point of view of ‘beautifying’ one’s <i>mitzvot</i>. The context of this matter as to whether it affects the performance of ritual, will be analyzed.</i>, as it is akin to covering them with gold, which disqualifies [the boxes].",
                " His most elevated eminence expanded on this issue with casuistry and reasoning<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The entire text of this missive is not available, see note 4, ans as an example, see note 196</i>.",
                "It is here that I will respond on a few of the comments of my esteemed interlocutor. These are the words of his eminence: We merited this legal decision based on the conclusions of the <i>Mordechai</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mordechai ben Hillel HaKohen (c. 1250–1298), also known as The Mordechai, was a 13th-century German rabbi and posek.

He was killed in the Rintfleisch massacres in 1298.</i>, that the use of leather from non-kosher animals or coating the boxes in gold, also disqualify [the <i>tfillin</i>].",
                "‘…So too did the <i>Beit Yosaif<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joseph ben Ephraim Karo, also spelled Yosef Caro, or Qaro (1488 – March 24, 1575),[1] was author of the last great codification of Jewish law, the Shulchan Aruch, which is still authoritative for all Jews pertaining to their respective communities.

In his time, he was also a preeminent astronomer and physician</i> and I found none who disagree with this reasoning’- is the end of his eminence’s statements.  [and] I say: I have not found in any of the earlier rabbinic decisors who implied that when the Talmud stated ‘If one coated them [<i>tefillin</i> boxes] with gold or hung upon them the hide of a non-kosher animal, they are disqualified [for use as phylacteries]’ to mean that it meant coating gold over the box. The illuminating<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lit. ‘light of our eyes’</i> rabbi, the Beit Yosef<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ibid. note 15</i> was not specific enough in this regard.",
                "The source of the matter here is in Tractate Menachot 42b: “This, however, is a matter of dispute between Tannaim, for it has been taught: If a man overlaid [the tefillin] with gold or covered them with the skin of an unclean animal, they are invalid<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That the law of the Lord may be in thy mouth (Ex. 13:9)</i>, the tefillin should be made from that which is permissible for food; if with the skin of a clean animal, they are valid, even though he did not prepare it for this specific purpose. Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel says, even if he covered them with the skin of a clean animal they are invalid, unless it had been prepared for this specific purpose<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Similarly the first Tanna and Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel would differ as to the necessity for weaving the threads specifically for the purpose of zizith</i> “.",
                "<i>Rashi</i>, loc. cit.” ‘If a man overlaid [the tefillin] with gold’ The boxes containing the <i>tfillin</i> are disqualified, as leather boxes are a requirement, as even the straps that are wrapped (around the arm) must be from that material (lit. ‘species’ or ‘type’, meaning: leather), as was stated in the tractate ‘One (a priest) who takes a handful ‘<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Menachot 35a see below note 32</i>. ‘Or one placed upon them’: That if one makes the boxes from the hide of a ritually impure animal, they are disqualified, as was stated in the chapter ‘Eight Crawling Species<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Babylonian Tractate Shabbat 108a see below</i>’: “So that the torah of Hashem will be in your mouth”- that which is permitted to be in your mouth. “- this is the end of <i>Rashi’s</i> text.",
                "It is apparent that <i>Rashi</i> unquestionably intended when he wrote ‘covered the <i>t’fillin</i> in gold’ meant that the boxes themselves were made of gold, and he coated the scriptural verses in gold. It is those verses which <i>Rashi</i> calls ‘<i>tefillin</i>’, which is identified in the companion<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lit. ‘and his friend will say this about him’</i> (next) text which disqualifies the use of an impure animal. <i>Rashi</i> explained that it applies toone who made the phylactery boxes from an impure animal. If that is so, then when he (<i>Rashi</i>) states “coated in gold”, it means the actual boxes",
                "Additionally, when <i>Rashi</i> expounded on the disqualifications of <i>tefillin</i> boxes, it included the qualification of being made out of leather, as even the straps that are tied on must be made from a similar animal hide, as was explained in the chapter ‘One who takes a Handful’.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See note 31</i> His (<i>Rashi)</i> intention was to that which was written on page 35a ‘that <i>tefillin</i> should not be tied with anything other than that (kosher) species.",
                "Indeed, if one presumes that leather boxes were made and then coated with gold, what is the logical connection to the straps?  The straps essence is to the tying (of the <i>tefillin</i>)? With regard to the straps, what is the reason they are disqualified?",
                "If one made (the requisite) black straps and then coated them with gold; and if one would posit that the reason for the disqualification would be secondary to the leather box not being visible<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Because it is coated with gold</i>, if that is so, the reason was not enumerated by <i>Rashi</i>! Why would <i>Rashi</i> abandon this basic explanation and employ an apriori reasoning to the straps instead?  The concepts must be related.",
                "Also, that which <i>Rashi</i> stated “The boxes are disqualified”, it is obvious that <i>Rashi’s</i> intent was not the the actual <i>tefillin</i>- meaning, the verses on the parchment- that are disqualified, as they made be taken out and placed into other boxes.",
                "Should one presume that this involves making leather boxes which were then coated with gold, if so, then the boxes are not disqualified, as the coating can be removed, and will revert to their original state.",
                "If it is so that in any case, prior to removing the gold coating it is entirely disqualified and when the coating is removed even the boxes are qualified; why then did <i>Rashi</i> write that the boxes are disqualified, <i>Rashi</i> should have explained that the <i>tefillin</i> were disqualified! Rather it is unquestionably obvious that Rashi explained that <i>braitta</i> of “One who coats the <i>tefillin</i> with gold” , means, that he coated the compartments with gold and made the boxes themselves out of gold. However, if he made the boxes from the hides of a kosher animal and then coated it with something else- that is not mention in this <i>braitta</i> [ruling].",
                "Our great Rabbi, the <i>Rambam</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See note 19. For a more complete quote, See the Appendix.</i>, in chapter 3 of Laws Pertaining to <i>Tefillin</i>, and these are his words in section 15: “The leather used to cover the <i>tefillin</i> and from which the straps are made should come from a kosher species of animal, beast, or fowl….If, however, leather from a non-kosher species was used or if they were covered with gold, they are not acceptable”. Indeed, in his (Maimonides) language there is no doubt that when he wrote “leather used to cover the tefillin ”meant the actual leather of the boxes. Indeed, there is no mention anywhere in the words of the Rambam regarding covering another leather on top of the original leather of the boxes.",
                "It is true that according to the opinion of the <i>Rambam</i>, a cloth must be folded on to the compartments before they (the parchments) are placed in the boxes, as noted in Chapter 3:1 and 3:8.",
                "However, that one would have to cover the leather boxes with leather on the outside- that was not understood (lit. ‘heard’) at all. These are his words in the beginning of Laws Pertaining to Phylacteries: “Four passages [of the Torah<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Which contain references to the mitzvah of <i>tefillin</i></i>, which are ‘Make unique to me’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 13</i>….are written on separate parchments and covered with leather, and are called <i>tefillin</i> (phylacteries)…” If that is so, then that which he specifies ‘and covered with leather’, specific to the word ‘leather’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Hebrew that is designated by the designating letter ה- ‘hay’, meaning “THE leather”. There are other forms that the letter is used for, such as the ‘questioning’ hay.</i>, meaning the leather referred to in the initial wording of these laws, that when her states ‘covered with leather’, it means the leather of the actual boxes. It is to this that he refers to when he stated “If he made them from the hide of an impure animal, they are disqualified”.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chapter 3:15. See page 6 above.</i>",
                "If that is so, then that which he stated ‘the leather that covers the <i>tefillin</i>’ means the leather of the boxes. Indeed, he calls the scripture parchments ‘<i>tefillin’,</i> therefore, when he states ‘coated with gold’ or ‘coated the <i>tefillin</i> in gold’, ‘<i>tefillin’</i> are the parchments and ‘coated with gold’ means, however, that the boxes were made of gold, and not that they were made of leather and coated with gold<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I found the syntax here a little difficult and hope I preserved the intent.</i>.

                "It is because of this that I am perplexed by what the <i>Beit Yosaif</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See note 16; In this case it is 32:39 see note 47</i> wrote in <i>Orakh Khayim</i> 32, writing that from the words of the <i>Rambam</i> it appears that that when one disqualifies another leather on the boxes, it is <i>not</i> that the boxes themselves were made from  aan impure animal etc.. It seems overturned<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Drawing from the reference to Esther 9:1</i>, as the words of Maimonides are the exactly opposite!",

He is often referred to as Rabbenu Asher, “our Rabbi Asher” or by the Hebrew acronym for this title, the ROSH (רא\"ש‎, literally \"Head\").</i>, in his smaller collection of <i>Halachot</i>, wrote: “Our rabbis taught: If they were coated with gold…..Rabbi Shim’own ben Gamliel states: Even the hides of a ritually pure animal are disqualified untio they are made specific to the task<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lit. ‘made to its name’- meaning here, made for making tefillin.</i>. In the Laws Concenring <i>Sefer Torah</i> (Torah Scrolls) I wrote that the law is like rabbi Shim’own ben Gamliel, that it must be made specific to the task, ergo, the parchment, straps and the boxes must be made specific to the task”- end of quotation.",
                "As the <i>Rosh</i> thought there, towards the end of his statement, that the parchment, straps and the boxes, and compares them to the hide of the boxes, as they are also disqualified if they are not made to the specific task, so that one can generalize that he also explains that <i>braitta</i> as pertaining to the actual boxes; it does not seem to apply to the hide that is <i>on the boxes at all</i>.",
                "It should be noted, however, that this reasoning can be deflected, as towards the end of his opinion<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rosh The ‘Smaller’ volume of Halcahot Concenring Tefillin, on Tractate Menachot. It is fully quoted here</i>, he posits that it is absolute in its application to the <i>tefillin</i> (the actual parchment writing), but not to any leather that is on the boxes- even if the boxes were covered with leather that was not made specifically for that purpose- are disqualified, as per rabbi Shim’own ben Gamliel",
                "Nevertheless, there is no obligation at all for there to be leather on top of the boxes, and this was not included in their thinking.",
                "It should be noted, that later on, considering that the straps should have a pass-through<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See note 35f</i> as a <i>halacha passed down from Moses at Sinai</i>, the <i>Rosh</i> wrote: “There are those who interpret the ‘pass-through’ as made from a small strap that is passed over the arm <i>tefillin</i>….and even if the interpretation is not that it’s a small strap, nevertheless, such <i>tefillin</i> are not disqualified, as the outer casing, that does not see the outside air in these cases, unless one has made another box for it. The reason that ‘caoting them with gold’ disqualifies, is that they require being covered by the hides of a ritually pure animal, and this is akin to covering it with the hides of a ritually impure animal”- end quote of the <i>Rosh.</i>",
                "On first impression, how does the <i>Rosh</i> bring proof for that which is ‘coated with gold’? The reasoning cannot be that since the boxes do not see the outside environment, one then hangs the hide of a ritually impure animal on it- does that not need a valid comparison? Would it seem that if one hangs a ritually impure animal hide on it, it is also disqualified (as kosher <i>tefillin</i>) because it is not exposed to the outside air? Therefore, it must be that the boxes were made from the hide of a ritually pure animal.",
                "Seemingly, according to the reasoning of ‘external exposure’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That the <i>tefillin</i> boxes themselves should be exposed to the outside environment</i> there is no reason to disqualify golden boxes<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As those golden boxes are also ‘exposed to the outside air’!</i>, as there is no biblical directive to make the boxes from hides? Rashi, here in tractate Menachot, truly had difficulty with this and had to employ an a priori reasoning utilizing a comparison to the straps that must be made of (kosher) leather; as the straps are used to don the <i>tefillin</i>, so too, a priori, should the boxes.",
                "In the chapter entitled ‘Once the Sentence is Passed’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Bavli Sanhedrin 48b; see note 61</i>,<i> Rashi</i> explained that it is law ‘passed down to us from Moses was on Mount Sinai’. However, in truth, we have not found any source in the Talmud that explicitly states the need for the boxes to be made from hides! I would understand<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lit. ‘this would be good’</i> if the boxes were made from the hide of a ritually impure animal- it would certainly be disqualified- as it requires ‘the work of heaven’’ that ‘which is permitted in your mouth’.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See note 27</i> However, something which is not forbidden, despite it not being hide, we have not found any place that explicitly disqualifies, except for this <i>braitta</i> stating that ‘coated with gold, disqualifies’.",
                "Ergo, it is better to explain this <i>braitta</i> as <i>not</i> dealing with the case of making the actual boxes out of gold, rather, that it deals with boxes made with permissible leather hide(s), and then coated them with gold, that is what the <i>braitta</i> intended. The disqualification is secondary to box being covered<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lit. ‘not exposed to the outside air’</i>, to wit, brings credence to the disqualification of boxes not exposed to the outside air.",
                "It is on this that the <i>Rosh</i> comments<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See note 49 and page 10</i>, that it (the <i>braitta</i>) is not so, rather, it deals with the case of making the actual boxes out of gold, comparing it (the boxes) to making them from an impure animal.

                "Here too, ‘coated with gold’ -that the boxes themselves were made from gold- are disqualified, as they need to be made from hide, as explained by Rashi. If that is so, there is no longer a need to explain the <i>braitta</i> as pertaining to boxes made of leather hide and then coated with gold, and then to state that they require exposure to the outside environment, as this <i>braitta</i> can be understood simply as the case of the actual boxes were made from gold.",
                "Know that the opinion of the <i>Rosh</i>, prima facie (on this topic) are bewildering: What was the need<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For the <i>braitta</i> to write</i> to write ‘coated with gold’ if the reason was not that ‘it must see the outside air’?

                "If that is so, the entire box would be ‘coated’ from each side<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There are 6 sides to a cube and the ‘little’ strap covers the underside of the <i>tefillin</i> box.</i>. If that is so, the coating itself is what is on the outside which is ‘exposed to the outside environment’- it is qualified because of this covering and not what is inside it.",
                "However, this small strap-that goes across the width of the arm<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The width of the area of the arm the <i>tefillin</i> box is placed upon</i>- as explained by the <i>Tur</i> in chapter 32<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To be more specific: <i>Orakh Khayim</i> 32. See below 70</i>, note that it does not cover all sides of the box. If that is so, one cannot think that this small strap was for the box itself, and one must know that this small strap is under the leather of the box. Ergo, one could argue, prima facie, that is should disqualify secondary to preventing the box from being exposed to the outside air! The <i>Rosh</i> would have to contend that in the case of ‘coated with gold’, the reason cannot be secondary to exposure to the outside environment, only that the reason is the necessity of being covered with a permissible hide<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Meaning, that despite there being a ‘covering’ around a portion of the box (albeit, the underside which has NO ‘exposure to the outside, as it rests on the ‘width of the arm’!) -and that it is still ‘kosher’ <i>tefillin</i>- then being covered by a kosher hide is permissible.</i>.",
                "Yet here, there is a possibility to explain the opinion of the <i>Rosh</i> that he too would interpret the <i>braitta</i> ‘coated with gold or covered with the hide from an impure animal…’ applies to the situation where, underneath, the box was made from permissible hide(s) and on the top, it was coated with gold or with hides from ritually impure animal.",
                "Rather, the <i>Rosh</i> stated specifically that gold is not permissible to make <i>tefillin</i> boxes, and that is why he disqualifies it even when (just) covering the top of the box.

Eidels is also known as Maharsha (מהרש\"א, a Hebrew acronym for \"Our Teacher, the Rabbi Shmuel Eidels\"). The Maharsha was born in Kraków, Poland. From early childhood, the Maharsha's remarkable talents were evident. When he came of marriageable age, the Maharsha was offered many prestigious shidduchim (marriage partners), but he rejected them, asserting that he wanted to devote himself solely to Torah study. He married the daughter of Edel Lifschitz of Posen and the late Moshe Lifschitz, rabbi of Brisk. He then moved to Posen and he established a yeshiva there. For twenty years all the expenses of the yeshiva were assumed by his mother-in-law. In appreciation of her support he adopted her name. After her death, he served as rabbi in the following prominent communities: Chełm, Lublin and Ostroh. Eidels was also active in the Council of Four Lands.</i> and the <i>Morsha”k</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">140</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See note 122, as the acronym is likely Rabbi Shlomo Kluger.

In addition, perhaps the outside box is ‘not being exposed to the outside air’ also does not apply except to the head box of the <i>tefillin</i>, and not to the arm box, as was explained in the response literature of the <i>Gaonim</i>. ”.",
                "Their explanation is obfuscating and they did not explain the reasoning why the concept of ‘not seeing the outside air’ applies only to the head box, and not to the arm box.",
                "The <i>Rosh</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">143</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See note 50</i> in his chapter on the Laws concerning <i>Tefillin</i>, also wrote to permit this ‘small strap’ that was mentioned above, because, “nevertheless, the <i>teffilin</i> are not disqualified because of ‘not seeing the outside air’ in these instances, except if one ties another box to it….",
                "Also, the concept of ‘not seeing the outside air’applies only to the head box of the <i>tefillin</i>, which is made of four compartments, moving any one from its designated place. However, in the arm box, which has only one compartment, it does not apply, and so it seems from the Responsae of the Gaonim.” – endquote of the <i>Rosh.</i>",
                "We see tha the <i>Rosh</i> understands the reasoning of the <i>Gaonim</i> as that it does not apply  here except in the cxase of the <i>tefillin</i> head-box- since it has four compartments- and one of them has been moved out of place. However, in the case of the <i>tefillin</i> arm-box, which has only one compartment- it does not apply.",
                "So too, the <i>Mordechai</i> wrote<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">144</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Note 71, first paragraph</i> that this applies only to the head-box, and reasoned that there is no application of the rule of ‘exposure to the outside’ for the arm-box, which seem to be the same intention as the <i>Rosh</i>! He also added that the concept of ‘switching the parchments from the inside to the outside’ only apllies to the head-box: in each compartment there are different scriptural passages written on the parchment, and when one switches the order, the passages that should be on the inside on then on the outside and vice versa.",
                "However, <i>Tosafot</i>’s<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">145</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See note 133 and 134 above</i> explanations were unclear, and they did not explain why these principles applies to the head-box and not the arm-box.",

Rabbi Yochanan promised Reish Lakish his sister's hand in marriage if the latter would rejoin the yeshiva and begin his studies anew (Baba Metzia 84a). R. Yochanan might be called a teacher of Reish Lakish (Brachot 31a); but the latter, through his extraordinary talent and his exhaustless diligence, soon attained so complete a knowledge of the Law that he stood on an equal footing with R. Yochanan. They are designated as \"the two great authorities\" (Yer. Berakhot 12c). While R. Yochanan was still in Sepphoris, teaching at the same time as Hanina, Reish Lakish stood on an equality with him and enjoyed equal rights as a member of the yeshiva and council (Yer.

Rather, it is obvious that this is also part of a long Mishna in the chapter entitled “One Who Reads, Stands”One who coats [one’s <i>tefillin</i>] with gold…” If that is so, one perforce would deduce that it means that the actual [hide] boxes were coated from above with gold.",
                "If that is so, then perhaps the disqualification is secondary to the box ‘not seeing the outside air’, despite the fact that the the actual box is permitted (‘kosher’)?

                "Yet, it is still difficult: On its basis, from where does the Talmud come to question Rav Yosaif? Perhaps this ‘coating with gold’ means ‘coating with gold’ on top of the hide of the boxes? Rather, the Talmud reasons that there is no reason to disqualify for such a case. This, in my mind, there is no doubt that if the hide boxes were coated with anything one wanted, with the exception of the head-box -if the <i>Shin</i> does not protrude- however, if they do protrude, it would be permissible (‘kosher’).",

                "However, that the blackening that we apply to the <i>tefillin</i>, this applies to the hide and is secondary to it, and the concept of ‘the box does not see the outside air’ doesn’t apply to it. If we come to disqualifying with this, what parameters could we give to the dyes that blacken the boxes? If there is any ‘substance tro it, it would disqualify! This thinking cannot be acceptable, nor did any of our forbearers even consider this!",
                "Since the hides of the boxes are also required to be black-and to some of the previous <i>halachic</i> authorities it is an ancient (‘Mosaic’) tradition- and to my understanding, also the opinion of the Jerusalem Talmud, in the chapter entitled ‘One Who Reads Must Stand’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">185</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See note 178</i>, is the same, as I stated above.

                "I can also apply this to the black coloring of <i>tefillin</i>. All that is added to increase the blackness belongs to this and all is subsumed under the rubric of ‘black coloring’.  I would also say the same applies to ‘coating it with gold’- even if one supposes that it means coating on top of the hide of the boxes- despite that, I would say specifically when they  coat it with gold, as this coating is an entity within itself, as one place a gold foil upon them. However, if one made the hide of the boxes gold colored, the way they color silver objects to make them look like gold, it would not disqualify to those who hold that the boxes do not necessarily have to be black, as this is a beautification that is subsumed to the purpose of the <i>tefillin</i> boxes.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">191</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Likely meaning that this would be masking one’s mitzvot beautiful (‘הידור מצוה’)</i>",

His full name is Avraham Abele ben Chaim HaLevi from the town of Gombin.

His brother Yehudah traveled in 1673 to Amsterdam to print the work, but did not have the needed funds, and died on the journey. It was not published until 1692 by Shabbethai Bass in Dyhernfurth after Rabbi Gombiner’s death. His son Chaim wrote in the preface to the work that his father was frequently sick and suffered pain and discomfort.</i> wrote on (O”H) 33:7 concerning <i>tefillin</i> straps that were blackened by a non-Jew: If a Jew then reapplied the dye with the intent to fulfill that specific <i>mitzva</i>, then they are permitted for use. This was stated in tractate Gittin 20b: If one wrote the ‘Name’ of God and did not sanctify it, then one should pass the quill over it and sanctify it. Even according to the majority of Talmudic rabbis there is no argument, rather, it appears checkered/spotted; if that were not so, it would be permitted. If that is so, then all would permit it! See the <i>Evehn Haezer</i> chapter 131:4”-[end quote of the <i>Magen Avraham</i>].",
                "In the case of that which hardens occasionally, how does a repeat blackening change things?  The initial dyeing on the straps ‘blocks’ the next coating and forms a partition between it and the strap?",
                "Also, the concept of occasionally hardening is seen in the words of the <i>Magen Avraham</i> mentioned above, as he wrote that even according to the majority of the Talmudic rabbis, it was only because it would appear spotted etc., and this is only according to Rabbi Akha’s opinion there in tractate <i>Gittin</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">199</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See note 201 for fuller text.

Since we establish he <i>halachic</i> ruling in the <i>Shulkhan Aruch Evehn HaEzer</i> according to Rabbi <i>Khisda’s</i> opinion, if that is so, then I find the explanation of the <i>Magen Avraham</i> bewildering- end quote of my esteemed questioner<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">202</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See note 14, we do not have the full text of the question.

Therefore, Shach concludes, in contrast with other responsa, the parameters of the questions posed in the Terumat HaDeshen are themselves binding when alluded to in the answer. However, with the printing of the work Leket Yosher of Joseph (Joselein) ben Moses in 1903, it became apparent that the responsa were in fact based on actual questions, as the individuals who asked the questions are clearly identified there.<br>The work is named for the practice in the Temple in Jerusalem of removing a part of the previous day's ashes from the furnace – 354 is the numerical value of Deshen (Hebrew: דשן).

However, as Hebrew literacy declined, particularly after the Romans expelled the Jews from Israel, the Rabbis realized the need for aids to pronunciation, so they developed a system of dots and dashes known as nikkudim (points). These dots and dashes are written above or below the letter, in ways that do not alter the spacing of the line. Text containing these markings is referred to as \"pointed\" text.</i>, that which was edited concerning the word <i>m-m-ch<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the <i>machzor</i> of <i>Rosh HaShana</i>, the term <i>m-m-ch</i> occurs in the sentence “…nothing is hidden <i>from you</i>”. מִמְּךָ (<i>mi-meh-</i>cha is a contraction of ‘from you’ (מן שלך), and pronounced with slight gutteral <i>ch</i> as oposed to the full gutteral kh- ח) is more common in the Bible than מִמֶּךָּ (<i>mi meh-kah</i> the dot, known as a <i>dagesh</i>, ‘hardened the last consonant from the slight gutteral ‘ch’ to the ‘hard’ ‘kah’) . Vowels can alter the tense and gender in Hebrew. A search of the <i>Siddur</i> (Seder! – literally, the order of our prayers) of Rav Amram Gaon of 9th century Sura (off route 28 SW of Baghdad) revealed three locations, all in the High Holiday liturgy. </i></i>, which he edited with the <i>kamatz</i> vowel ‘uh’ under the letter <i>mem<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Pronounces <i>mi-mach</i>, a feminine form, ‘from you (female).’ </i></i>, and edited <i>m-m-ch</i> with a <i>sh’va</i> under the letter <i>mem</i> and a <i>kamatz</i> under the letter <i>kaff</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Pronounced <i>mi-meh-cha</i>, the masculine form </i> or <i>m-m-ch</i> with with a <i>dagesh</i> and a <i>kamatz</i> under the letter <i>kaff</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Pronounced <i>mi-meh-ka</i> , the <i>dagesh</i> serving to confuse and perhaps refer to both genders, as Hashem has been described as possessing both masculine and feminine traits. </i>",
                "Indeed, I have no business dealing with the rules of Hebrew grammar – specifically this word – which I have only found in the personal present or plural present as in “you [plural] send”.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Technically there is an ‘extra <i>mem</i> in <i>mimchem</i>, meaning ‘from you’ The verse referenced is from Gen 42:16 </i> It can also be seen in “Any matter that is difficult from you”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This from Deut. 1:17 The extra letter <i>mem</i> is not there (and may be the reason the letter is ‘dotted’ by a <i>dagesh</i>) to be read as ‘<i>meekehm</i>’ instead of ‘<i>mimchem</i>’.</i>.",
                "However, for one who is speaking for one’s self, whether singular or plural – and of course for the singular infinitive – it is either ‘from us’ or ‘from me’.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In these case the ‘extra <i>mem’</i> is seen and pronounces as <i>meemehnu</i> and <i>meemehnee</i>. </i>  So too, in the plural infinitive case, one uses ‘from them’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In this case the extra <i>mem</i> is missing and pronounced ‘<i>may-hem</i>’ (instead of ‘mim-hem’) </i>.

                "It is well known that even the masters of Hebrew grammar<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The most noted probably being Menahem ben Saruq (also known as Menahem ben Jacob ibn Saruq) was a Spanish-Jewish philologist of the tenth century CE.

                "Ergo, to my mind, even one who stated a part of a verse ‘<i>mee-mach’</i> in a place where the vowels need to be strung together equally<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is likely a reference to the ability of the liturgical poets to create such amazing pieces, often by stringing together parts of verses.
