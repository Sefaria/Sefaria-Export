                "In the year 5613 (1852/3), it occurred in a certain city that a rumor was heard about a certain teacher, who has been living there for 8 years. The children who studied under him in their youth, and are now 13 or older, testify that as minors, when they studied under him, he defiled them with homosexual intercourse, God save us. This past summer, when the matter became known to a God-fearing man, he raised a great and bitter outcry. The matter thus came before the rabbi, who is head of the rabbinical court, and they did not wish to accept testimony. And this man [the accused] accepted upon himself with an oath and a vow that immediately after that session he would move away from there. And behold, afterward he wished to be a teacher in Lvov. When the rumor was heard in Lvov, one respected layman sent a letter to the rabbi, head of the rabbinical court, and he responded that he would sit with the rabbinical court to investigate and inquire into the matter, and he did not find a smidgen of ineligibility according to the Torah, as there was no clarity in the matter, and a judge has only that which his eyes see. The custom in such a case is to maintain the presumption [of innocence]. So against the will of that layman, they kept the teacher there, saying that he is a master of his trade. The aforementioned brazen one then crowed like a bird that it was a treasonous scheme, that they are weak minded, and also that he gave the benefactor and leader 50 “Rhenish” Gulden to be recruited, and so they are interested parties. ",
                "Thus, in [the week of] Parashas Va’era, I received a letter reached me with testimony, signed with the seal of three respected men, and one man who recognizes the signatures attested to them. And two young men testified, one who is now 15 years old and one who is today over 13 years old, that in their youth, when they studied under him as boys of around 9 years old or less, he would defile them with homosexual intercourse, for they would sleep with him in a bed in the room where he lived. The matters were related with much elaboration, which is too obscene to put into writing.",
                "And this is what I responded: in truth, I have already written at length in a responsum that to disqualify a person it is necessary that there be two kosher witnesses. And I cited the words of Pri Hadash and Ritva that disqualifying a person requires two kosher witnesses, as it is like capital matters. If so, in this case, where they were minors at the time of the act and they are only believed to testify in their adulthood about what they saw in their childhood for questions of rabbinic law [not biblical], as explained in [Shulhan Arukh] Hoshen Mishpat §35. Here, then, to disqualify a person they are certainly not believed. However, according to what Maharik and Terumat Ha-deshen state, and as established by Rema on Shulhan Arukh, in a case where kosher witnesses are not necessary, even a woman and a minor child are believed. And if so, in this matter, where it is definitely impossible for there to be adult men, and it is impossible for there to be testimony in the matter, for without a doubt this man, even if he is wicked and corrupt, acts in secret and only amuses himself with young children. He is like a “madman shooting flaming arrows” (Prov. 26:18) who says “I am only playing.” If so, it is obvious that they are credible to testify. Moreover, do we wish to disqualify him from testifying or taking an oath? We are merely saying that perhaps he. And the [Sages] already said (Niddah 61) that a bad report need not be accepted, but one must be suspicious. And in Moed Kattan 18 they said that a bad report is, in any event, partially true. If so, then, woe unto us that in our days such a thing arose, that a man like this would be a teacher of young children of the study house, the breath of whose mouth is pure, and there is a concern that the breath of his unclean mouth will defile them. And therefore, in my opinion, it is appropriate to remove the crown of education from his head, and they should worry for their lives until he fully repents with mortifications, as appropriate. Then he may once again accept the status of a full community member, and it will be atonement for his sins. And as long as he does not confess his sins, repentance is inapplicable, as Tevu'ot Shor §2 states, and as I wrote at length in a responsum to Drohobych concerning a ritual slaughterer there. And I was told in the name the great and eminent, pious and righteous Rabbi David, of blessed memory, author of Ahavat David Ve-Yehonatan, that he explained as a moral allegory the statement in Shulhan Arukh: “One who urinates from Mt. Scopus and in [toward the Temple] should not sit facing the Sanctuary.” He explains that this refers to one who ejaculates and says that it is from “Scopus” and “within” – the eyes and the heart, the two facilitators of sin. On this it says that “he should not sit” (lo yeshev), i.e., that repentance (teshuva) is ineffective, if he faces the Sanctuary. The words of the wise bring joy.",
                "Regarding what we wrote above concerning a bad report, even though one need not accept it, one must be concerned, I later found in Maharik §188 that it is permissible to save them but not to punish them with any punishment or shaming based on a bad report. However, this is specific to the case there, where there was only a bad report. But here there was testimony; even though there were no kosher witnesses, it is still better than a mere bad report, so obviously students should be kept away from him. This is my humble opinion. ",
                "And behold, on the week of the holy Shabbat of Parashat Toldot that year, two letters reached me speaking and advocating on behalf of the same man. And this is what I responded to them both at once: That which you wrote to excuse why you didn’t accept testimony, writing first on the basis of the statement of Maharam Mintz in Responsum 75, that testimony may not be collected for slanderous purposes, the response is self-evident: the present case is different, because the purpose is to keep him from sinning. I add that this is evident also from the case of a single witness, where we maintain that “Tuvia sins but Zigod [the lone witness] gets lashes,” yet Shulhan Arukh, Hoshen Mishpat 28 explains that to prevent someone from sinning, it is permitted [to hear a lone witness]. As to your honor’s contention that the content of the witnesses’ testimony is null since they are minors, I wrote the same in my responsum, so I do not understand [the contention]. Similarly, your honor’s contention that the testimonies are separate [i.e., they are not reporting on the same event], and to disqualify someone there must be a single testimony [by multiple witnesses to the same event], as it is like a capital case, I do not understand [the contention], for I said something even stronger – there is not even separate testimony, as he is like a hunter.",
                "I will now respond in order. What you wrote about my statement that to prevent sin it is not necessary to collect [testimony] in the presence of the accused, and your honor’s contention that specifically in cases of ritual transgression, since the testimony need not be given in court, as the author of Netivot Mishpat writes at length in §§38 and 28, it is possible that it need not be collected in the presence of the accused either, because the Torah specifically cautioned the courts to accept testimony in the presence of the accused, this rationale is unacceptable. Indeed, even the words of the eminent [Netivot Mishpat] do not seem correct at all, and the response in Meshovev Netivot is excellent, but I do not wish to dispute that eminent sage out of respect for the Torah. And my distinction, that if we are trying to disqualify someone’s presumption of rectitude, [the testimony] must be obtained in the presence of the accused, but here we only wish to distance him, so that he does not study with students until he repents, and we are not coming to disqualify him, about which your honor wrote that he does not understand my discourse at all, for any time we disqualify someone it is only until he repents, but nevertheless we are not empowered to disqualify – I say that you are right that you do not understand my discourse. My intent was simply that that when one is removed from his presumption of rectitude we say that as a rule everyone has a presumption of rectitude and that it is impossible to disqualify him if he is not present, especially if it will hamper his livelihood. But here, his presumption of rectitude is not being disqualified. We are merely saying that a teacher of children must be in awe and fear of God’s word, more than other people, and yet we see that he makes light. Therefore we must distance him so that he makes a full repentance. Thus, on such a matter it is impertinent whether testimony was accepted while the accused was not present. As long as such rumors about him are heard, it is disgraceful and outrageous for him to teach there until he repents fully. And your contention that [the court panelists] are disqualified because they accepted testimony without the accused present, I understand that they did not want to accept the testimony at first, because if others accept the testimony, he certainly will not want to appear before them and indeed need not appear before them, and so they are afraid to accept testimony. And so even if they [in the first court] accept the testimony, they will be disqualified, and so the ordinance will not have helped, since we do not maintain that one always corroborates his original statement, as Ketzot Ha-hoshen states in 28:7 and 33:2 at length. This is indeed the law, as written in a responsum to the holy community of Przemysl.",
                "What you wrote regarding what I wrote in the name of Maharik and Shulhan Arukh §35 that the practice is to accept the testimony of even a minor when it is impossible for acceptable witnesses to have been present, namely, that it is clear from Maharik the claimant must be making a claim out of certainty, I am astonished. In that case, a claim of certainty is relevant, for the reason that Maharik states: if [claims need not be made with certainty], you do not let people live. But in the present case, why does lack of certainty make it worse? Must they know? Are we relying on this as testimony? And my contention that “one does not self-incriminate” is not relevant here because his only desire is to repent, about which your honor stated that it is relevant about himself even if not to disqualify himself, I am truly astonished. Are we using their testimony to disqualify? It is, after all, it is testimony about when they were minors, and it disqualifies only as a communal ordinance. Regarding your statement that we can “split the words” of the testimony, this is errand. Here, when we split his words and say that he did not have intercourse with this specific boy, there is once again no valid testimony. For, in truth, he was a minor, but we say that they were indeed present, and as a communal ordinance we accept their testimony. But if [the children] were simply to say that [the teacher] committed sodomy [without specifying their victimhood], they would not be believed. This is clear. "
