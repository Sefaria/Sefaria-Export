            "I saw in Vayilaket Yosef (3-4:74) that R'Yehudah Leib Marmorstein discussed the case of a youth ‎whose father had not allowed him to be circumcised. The youth now has died at the age of ‎sixteen, and Rabbi Marmorstein ruled that his grave should be distanced nine cubits from the ‎other graves; see his reasoning there. In my humble opinion, one should agree with him in ‎practice, but not due to his reason. He decided that it was obvious that this youth was a wicked ‎individual, and we do not bury the wicked alongside the righteous.(Sanhedrin 47a). One cannot ‎argue that the youth was a \"child held captive among non- Jews\" [who is not viewed as responsible ‎for his actions], for it is well known… and that Jews need to be circumcised.‎",
            "However, who could tell us that [this youth] definitely knew he wasn't circumcised? Does every ‎sixteen-year-old child know the nature of circumcision and the visual difference? Perhaps he was ‎modest and never looked at it his entire life. Think about it [further], due to our many sins there ‎are areas in Germany where the mohelim are severe sinners and do not perform priah [lit. ‎revealing; peeling off thee pithelium]! Many children are therefore as though they were not ‎circumcised [at all], for we learn, \"One who circumcised without priah is as if he had not ‎circumcised.\" (Mishnah Shabbat 19:6)However, none of them know that they are not circumcised; ‎certainly, they are like\" children held captive among non-Jews\". Further, even if they were to learn ‎afterward that priah is necessary, they wouldn't know that priah had not been performed on ‎them. Moreover: Even if you would say that he knew that he wasn't circumcised and despite that ‎he didn't circumcise himself, one could argue that he did so because he didn't want to pain himself, ‎and not because he kicked[i.e. rejected] the commandment of circumcision. If so, all would agree ‎that he was only a rebel concerning one matter, due to his desires. It seems to me that even in ‎Hungary the custom is not to distance the grave of such a rebel from other graves - in Germany, ‎the custom is certainly not so - and so there is no legal reason to change the youth's burial from the ‎burial of other Jewish sinners. ‎",
            "However, it seems to me that in order to fence in the matter one should prevent his burial among ‎other graves. This is meant to punish those heretics who nullify the covenant of our forefather ‎Avraham, not circumcising their sons, so that they shall understand and fear that this will cause ‎their sons to be entirely separated from the seed of Israel. Even after death, they will not have a ‎grave among the children of our forefather Avraham. Particularly in our time, when this ‎wickedness has spread due to our many sins, there is [a need] to establish boundaries in order to ‎distance those wicked ones from Jewry as much as possible...‎\n"
