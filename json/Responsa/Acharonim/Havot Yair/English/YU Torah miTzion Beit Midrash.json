            "Since you've made known to me that [your son] spoke beautifully at his Bar Mitzvah, I assume he's ‎already learned matters of aggada such as Midrash Rabbah and Ein Yaakov that, in truth, are good ‎for young men, like appetizers before the main course. They will also be glorious and beautiful in ‎the ears of those who hear[from him] a particular peshat or derash, or when he hears a talk from a ‎great[scholar] he will loudly interject and make known his knowledge and grasp [of the subject], ‎by which he [himself] will become known as a distinguished scholar. After all that, perhaps he will ‎find a wife and find goodness, wealth and riches. However, this would be neither the proper path ‎nor the proper city, nor is it the definition of a true scholar who has acquired wisdom, and grown to ‎the point that we would hope he would be able to render good and just rulings in Israel, who is ‎filled with the meat and wine of the [more] substantial matters of Torah.",
            "Concerning the ‎‎[management of the] stages [of your son's learning], this is a difficult matter for an individual –‎‎ even‏ ‏one who is wealthy and distinguished – To‏ ‏manage for his son. [And this would be‏ ‏the case ‎as well] even if one were to find a‏ ‏distinguished scholar who would teach for‏ ‏the sake of heaven, ‎without deception and‏ ‏for whom personal gain and reward is not‏ ‏all they have in mind. This ‎already is‏ ‏uncommon, and it may not even exist, but‏ ‏even if‏ ‏you were to look and find [you would ‎face another difficulty].‎‏ ‏All who have children who go to‏ ‏school‏ ‏adopt a manner of learning that is ‎not‏ ‏proper – so what could one local [teacher] do, to go against his colleagues and‏ ‏change [this ‎system] and adopt a proper‏ ‏approach against his peers? And even if one's father would hire a ‎teacher for him[alone], is not the greatest need in study‏ ‏the bond with friends, as it is written‏ ‏‎(Taanit 7a) “[I have learned] more from my‎‏ ‏friends than my teachers”? There is no‏ ‏solution for ‎this, unless one were to‏ ‏gather together five or six heads of household and hire a teacher for their‏ ‏sons, on condition that none could be‏ ‏added. They would provide [for the‏ ‏teacher] as befits him, ‎as though he had‏ ‏double the students. Then, Divine counsel will be effective through this system ‎of learning.‎"

In this responsa Rabbi Bachrach argues that seemingly irrational medical practices ought to be assumed to be based on rational science.] You asked a question regarding the incantations which some women know for certain aches, pains, and diseases, if they (i.e. the incantations) are prohibited because of “the ways of the Emorites.”...",

I found one of them in the 14th chapter of Shabbat, where they suggested regarding urine which sits for forty days that a barzina (an eighth of a revi’it) is useful for bee stings and a full revi’itis useful for scorpion stings. This requires analysis, how could one subject have two opposite effects,  since bees and scorpions are opposites, as our Sages state ... in the second chapter of Avodah Zarah that heat is good for scorpion stings and cold is good for bee stings, and the reverse is dangerous. .. And how could it be that one substance itself, with one cupful could cool down the hot, and drinking another cupful would warm up the cold ",

Because their intention was not that these things would work in and of themselves, rather [they work] only through mixing those things together with other ingredients and other powders. And through those ingredients and their mixture and their being cooked together, it is possible that the effects of those things which our Sages mentioned can change from one thing to its opposite. And I have found proof for this in the Book of Healing of Avicenna ...",
