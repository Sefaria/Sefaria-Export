            "You asked me to tell you my opinion re-garding Shabbat because there is a big difference between those who live in the East and those who live in the West, and we find that the day which is Shabbat for these is not Shabbat for those.",
            "Answer: Know that many great and honoured people have been perplexed by this question,  but  I  will  tell  you my opinion about  it. Know that  Shabbat  is  given to each individual from Israel as it says, “Because it  is a sign between Me and you,” and just like the sign of circumcision is for  each individual, so too Shabbat is given over to each individual. Since Shabbat is given to each individual every-where, any  time he counts six days on the end of the sixth day he makes Shabbat, which is a commemoration of  the creation of the world as it says, “Because in six days did G-d create etc.” Because if you don’t say this even in Israel itself there is some discrepancy. And even if you wish to argue that by means of the addition we make [for Shabbat] when it comes in and goes out (the discrepancy) is fixed [as the variation in the times for Shabbat is simply  included in  the  addition], nevertheless, this  addition is biblically mandated [with a specific length of  time], and it would then emerge that not all those who live in Israel are observing this addition equally. Because, behold, there is a distance of almost four days’ journey in Israel from the East to the West, and even in cities which are close there is a discrepancy in this regard such as between Tiberias and Zippori ... Moreover, the Sages said, “One who travels in the desert and doesn’t know when Shabbat is should count six days from the day of his mistake and sanctify the seventh and recite the blessing of the day and make havdalah after Shabbat.” ... And know that an argument occurred between the early  commentators about which place the day begins from, and also at  which  place does Shabbat  begin; see the Kuzari and Y’sod Olam. According to them, all those who live at the edge of the East start Shabbat before those who live West, such that these are permitted in work when these are forbidden. Rather, we must say that Shabbat is given to each individual according to his location. He should count six days and rest on the seventh and through this there is a commemoration of the creation of the world."
