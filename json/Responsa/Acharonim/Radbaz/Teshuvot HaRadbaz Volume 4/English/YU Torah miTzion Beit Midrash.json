Therefore, this was never intended to be a ‎permanent enactment, and this is clear from his text for any who have eyes to see. Therefore, the ‎claim that one should not nullify an age-old custom is defeated, as is the claim that nullifying this ‎practice would be a case of a student contradicting his master. As far as the claim that the reasoning of the Rambam still applies and therefore we should keep ‎the practice at least on Shabbat and Yom Tov when many people come to pray, I think the ‎opposite is true. I have seen with my own eyes that before the chazzan has even finished half of ‎the tefillah many people finish their private tefillah and turn to their friends and begin to talk [despite the Rambam’s enactment]. Therefore, we are back to square one. We violate the ‎ruling of the Gemara, halachic decisors and the authorities of tradition and still have not ‎accomplished anything at all. The Rambam only",
            "enacted that people should pray word for word with the chazzan, as he wrote multiple times in ‎his responsa, and since his institution has done nothing we should return to the practice of the ‎Gemara. We can be sure that were the Rambam alive today, he would encourage people to ‎return to the practice of the Gemara since his desired outcome was not accomplished.‎"
