Therefore, this was never intended to be a ‎permanent enactment, and this is clear from his text for any who have eyes to see. Therefore, the ‎claim that one should not nullify an age-old custom is defeated, as is the claim that nullifying this ‎practice would be a case of a student contradicting his master. As far as the claim that the reasoning of the Rambam still applies and therefore we should keep ‎the practice at least on Shabbat and Yom Tov when many people come to pray, I think the ‎opposite is true. I have seen with my own eyes that before the chazzan has even finished half of ‎the tefillah many people finish their private tefillah and turn to their friends and begin to talk [despite the Rambam’s enactment]. Therefore, we are back to square one. We violate the ‎ruling of the Gemara, halachic decisors and the authorities of tradition and still have not ‎accomplished anything at all. The Rambam only",
            "enacted that people should pray word for word with the chazzan, as he wrote multiple times in ‎his responsa, and since his institution has done nothing we should return to the practice of the ‎Gemara. We can be sure that were the Rambam alive today, he would encourage people to ‎return to the practice of the Gemara since his desired outcome was not accomplished.‎"

            "Question: It happened that a Kushite woman from the land of Kush, also called Al-Habash (Abyssinia/Ethiopia), was captured along with her two sons. She was bought by Reuven, and we inquired about her status. She said that she was married; that these are her children by her husband, whose name is X; that this son’s name is Y; that enemies attacked them and killed all of the men, and they captured and plundered the women and children. It became clear that she is of the seed of Israel, from the tribe of Dan, which dwells in the highlands of Kush. From that time until now, she has been presumed to be an agunah, but during this time, her master Reuben had relations with her and sired a son. He has grown up, and he wishes to marry a woman from the Jewish community and to enter it. You have asked me whether he is worthy of entering the community, and what is his remedy.",
            "Response: We learned in the chapter “Ha-isha Shalom” (Yevamot 114b): “If there is peace between him and her, and war in the world, and she says, ‘My husband died in the war,’ she is not believed.” Maimonides writes that this applies even if she says, “I buried him.” The reason for this is that she is assuming (i.e., she has no direct evidence of his death). It is then asked in the Talmud: What is the law if she established that there is war? Do we say that she had no reason to lie, since she could have said that there is peace, or since it has been established for her, she is making an assumption, and her lack of reason to lie does not weaken what she established? This query is not resolved, so Maimonides ruled that such a woman should not marry, but if she married she need not divorce. This further implies that the offspring is admissible. Thus, it seems that since she established that there is war, the child is admissible, and she was mistakenly presumed to be married [to her first husband]. However, after scrutiny, this is not so. First, the black-letter law is in dispute, since Rosh writes: “This has not been resolved, so we act stringently.” This implies that if she [re]marries, she must be divorced, and the status of the offspring is uncertain. His son, R. Yaakov, similarly writes (Tur, Even Ha-ezer 17):  Even if we did not know that there is war but for her report, and she says that he died in the war, she is not believed. Maimonides wrote on this case that if she [re]married, she need not divorce, but my father and master, Rosh, did not write so. I further say that this is the position of Rif, since he did not record the Talmud’s question but did record another question, about a single witness reporting war, because even though this query was not resolved in this passage, it was resolved elsewhere, as written in [Rif’s] Halakhot. But our question, where the woman herself established that there was war, is left out, and Rif records the mishna as is: “If there is peace between him and her, and war in the world…she is not believed.” This implies that she is not believed in any such case.",
            "I later found that Rosh writes in a responsum: “This query was not resolved, so we are stringent. Rif rules thus as well.” One may ask: We say in a case where one married a woman after she obtained a “bald bill of divorce,”  according to the Sages, who we follow in this case, that she must divorce [the second husband] but the offspring is admissible. Here too, why do we not say that the woman must divorce [the second husband], but the offspring is admissible? We can answer: A bald bill of divorce is ineffective by rabbinic law, but in the present case, since she made her statement based on assumption, and was imprecise, yet remarried, she presumptively remains a married woman [to the first husband], and the offspring is possibly (safek) a mamzer. Moreover, even according to Maimonides, this woman was a presumptive agunah for several years, and the rabbis established this matter. Therefore, we uphold her presumptive status. I say even further. Even according to her own words she is presumptively a married woman, for it is well known that there is constant war between the kings of Kush, which contains three kingdoms. Some of them are Muslims, some of them are Aramean [Christians] who uphold their religion, and some of them are Israelites from the tribe of Dan. Apparently they are of the Sadducee and Boethusean sect known as the Karaites, as they do not know the Oral Law and do not kindle flames on the eve of the Sabbath. There is ceaseless war among them, and each day they capture from one another. Therefore, there is no credibility on the basis of being able to claim (migo) that there was peace, because it is well known to us that there is no peace there. Moreover, even if we would not know that they are at war, since we also do not know that they are at peace, [the fact that she did not claim that there is peace] confers no credibility, because she would not claim that out of fear that she will be contradicted. I have inferred this from the formulation of Rashi, who wrote: “Rava asks regarding a case where there is peace in the world, and she says that he died in war.” Since he did not write that Rava asks about a case in which we do not know whether there is war in the world, which would have been a more novel formulation, the implication is that he is precise in his formulation that there is peace in the world, for in such a case the unmade claim (migo) confers credibility, as I have written. Moreover, this rule applies only to a woman in general who comes and reports that her husband died at war, but this woman who says that all the men died is certainly making an assumption: since everyone was killed, her husband was also killed. So since she did not say explicitly that her husband was killed, we do not believe her. There is yet another compelling reason: Since she was a captive in our presence, nothing can create a stronger presumption of war—for they did not take captives except during war. If so, she did not establish that there is war, rather we knew it from seeing her in the hand of her captors. So there is no credibility conferred by alternate claims (migo). For the query, “What is the law if she established that there is war?” only refers to the case like the woman in the mishna: “A woman who goes with her husband to a province by the sea, and she returns and says…” It does not, however, refer to one who is brought by captors. The intelligent will deem this reasoning correct. There is another reason that applies generally to Karaites, for they are Israelites. Their betrothals are [valid] betrothals, but their bills of divorce (gittin) are not as the Sages instituted. They are all invalid witnesses on the Torah level. Because this inquiry is dangerous—for many such families have been admitted into the community—I will not write about this at length. “It is better that they are unwitting….” Nevertheless, I concede that if they would all agree espouse the rabbinic religion and accept the tradition of the Sages, to be like us, I would permit them to join the community, pending the agreement of the rabbis, may God protect them. The reason is that all of their betrothals are in the presence of witnesses who are invalid—just as he marries her, so he divorces her (i.e., neither the marriage nor the divorce is halakhically valid). Concern is limited to the first generation—those who wed with valid witnesses—lest one woman from that generation was divorced, after their heresy, in the presence of invalid witnesses, whereupon she married after receiving such a bill of divorce. In such a case, the children are mamzerim. Yet I would not use this concern to discredit the reputation of these people, for it is a farfetched concern. For perhaps those who followed Zadok and Boethus were not married to women. And even if they were, perhaps none of them divorced their wives. And if one of them divorced his wife, perhaps it was in the presence of valid witnesses, and as the Sages ordained, for in that generation they did not become complete heretics as they are at present, after they had commentators, like Anan and his colleagues, who misled them. And even if the divorce was in the presence of invalid witnesses, perhaps the divorced woman did not remarry. And even if she remarried, perhaps she did not have children by her second husband. And even if she had children, perhaps the child was infertile. And if the child was infertile, perhaps they died young and never had children. And if they had children, each individual today can still claim “I am not one of them,” and as individuals, each can be admitted to the community.",
            "The general rule is that since there is no clear prohibition, if they all would agree to return to us and accept the words of the Sages, I would carry a chip from the beam, together with my colleagues, to allow their admission into the community. This is the formulation of Kaftor Va-ferah: \"It stands to reason that we should be concerned if one of them betrothed a Jewish woman, as is stated regarding a Samaritan who betrothed: ‘It happened, and they required a bill of divorce for her.’ The same applies in similar cases.\" Thus, we find that his leniency is stringency, and the Sadducees are not found today to be making things worse; rather, many of them are returning to Judaism. This accords with an incident from the end of cycle 267,  when a large congregation of them returned to Judaism on a single day in Egypt, through the Nagid Rabbi Abraham. One who is stringent is praiseworthy. I believe that this Nagid Rabbi Abraham was the son of Maimonides. Yet he was not concerned, and accepted them. David ibn Abi Zimra"

            "<b>Question:</b> You asked why they did not decree [the recitation of the blessing,] <i>shehechaynu</i> (who has kept us alive) with the counting of the omer. ",
            "<b>Answer:</b> The early rabbis (Rishonim), may their memory be blessed, already spoke about this. And the Ran (Rabbenu Nissim) wrote in the Laws of Sukkot - and these are his [words] - \"I have seen someone write that if one does not count at night, he may not count during the day; as it is taught (in a mishnah), 'The entire night is suitable for the counting of the omer.' It is implied that during the day, however, it is not. And because of that, we do not recite the blessing over time (<i>shehechaynu</i>).\" To here [are his words]. And it appears to me that the reason for the thing is that it would be fine if when he did not count at night, he could count during the day - it would come out that its time is set and all of the fifty days would be one time. So he would be able to recite the blessing, <i>shehechaynu</i>. But now that if he did not count at night, he could not count during the day - it comes out that this day has no possibility of being made up. So how could he recite the blessing [which includes the words], \"we have reached this time,\" for the counting of fifty days? For he has not counted all fifty! And that which he goes back to counting on the next night - that is a different time. And it was impossible to decree that he should recite the blessing, <i>shehechaynu</i>, at the beginning of the counting - and if he forgets and does not count a night, he goes back and recites the blessing, <i>shehechaynu</i>, again on the next night; and likewise each time he forgets a day. As behold, it is all one commandment; and one may not recite this blessing twice upon [the same] one commandment. Regardless, concerning the essence of the question, I say [about] any commandment which is a preparation for another commandment - they decreed that one should recite the blessing, <i>shehechaynu</i>, on the main commandment, and take care of both of them. Hence, the counting of the omer is a preparation for [Shavuot], as it is written (Deuteronomy 16:9-10), \"Seven weeks count for yourself; from the time the sickle begins felling the standing grain, etc. Then you shall observe the Feast of Shavuot for the Lord, your God.\" So it counts for this and for that. And like this do we say about the making of a sukkah, such that there would be a need to recite the blessing, <i>shehechaynu</i>, at the time of its making. And even so, we only recite a blessing upon it at the time of the commandment, which is the time of the festival, and it counts for this and for that. Moreover, it is because the end of the commandment is only at the end of the counting. And hence it is impossible to recite the blessing, <i>shehechaynu</i>, at the beginning of the counting, as it is only a part of the commandment; nor at its end, as we do not recite the blessing, <i>shehechaynu</i>, at the end of a commandment. And the Rashba wrote that we do not recite the blessing, <i>shehechaynu</i>, on something that is [a cause for] anguish. And I have written what appears correct according to the poverty of my knowledge. David ibn avi Zimra."
