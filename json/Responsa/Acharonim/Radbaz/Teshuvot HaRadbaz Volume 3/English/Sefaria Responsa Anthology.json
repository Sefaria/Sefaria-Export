            "You have asked me, and I will inform you of my opinion: Upon what does everyone rely to ingest the flesh of a corpse, called “mummy,” as a remedy, when there is no danger, and in the normal way of ingestion? Moreover, they trade it, engaging in its commerce, yet it is forbidden to derive benefit from it, for we maintain that it is forbidden to benefit from the flesh of a corpse, as Scripture states: “There died Miriam.”",
            "Response: You need not have asked about the prohibition on eating (issur akhila), for it is certainly permissible to eat. Its form has been altered and it has returned to mere dust, certainly by means of fragrant drugs, for the mummy is the embalmed flesh, which is treated with several types of fragrant drugs so that the form and body are preserved, that has become tarlike. It is not forbidden to eat it, as I have written with regard to musk and theriac. However, with regard to the prohibition on deriving benefit (issur hana’ah), this rationale is clearly insufficient grounds to permit. After all, it remains forbidden to benefit from the charcoal of hametz that has been scorched, as stated in the chapter “Kol Sha’ah” (Pesahim, chapter 2). Furthermore, we maintain that it is forbidden to derive benefit from the dust of all those who are buried. Therefore, it seems to me that in order to take this remedy even when there is no danger, they relied on the fact that this is not the normal way of deriving benefit. There is no question about making it into a bandage, which is certainly not in the normal way of deriving benefit, but even eating or drinking it is not the normal manner of deriving benefit from it, for fragrant drugs are mixed into it. On the contrary, one does not benefit from the flesh itself by virtue of the flesh, but by virtue of the drugs that are in it. Note that the flesh of all those corpses that are not embalmed is not effective at all. The Talmud (Pesahim 25b) makes an even more far-reaching statement: \"Mar b. R. Ashi found Ravina rubbing his daughter with undeveloped olives of orla.  He said to him: “Granted, the rabbis ruled [thus] in time of danger; was it [likewise] ruled when there is no danger?” He replied: “This malady is like a time of danger.” Some say, he answered him: “Am I then using it in the normal way of deriving benefit from it?”\" They explained “not in the normal way of deriving benefit from it” to mean that the dregs of the olives are mixed into oil, so this is not the normal way of deriving benefit from it. Thus, if mixing dregs with oil makes it “not the normal way of deriving benefit,” then certainly in the present case, where drugs are mixed with the flesh of the corpse, and in fact the drugs are primary, it is as I have written. We maintain that no Torah prohibitions incur lashes unless consumed in the normal manner of benefit, with the exceptions of crossbred vines (kil’ei ha-kerem) and milk and meat, for which lashes are incurred even if one benefits not in the normal way, since the Torah does not mention “eating” with regard to them. Therefore, one may not use them as a remedy at all, except in a case of danger. But all other prohibitions, since they are only rabbinically forbidden except when consumed in the normal manner, one may use them as a remedy even if there is no danger. And if you ask that Ravina used it as an ointment, and perhaps any manner of eating remains forbidden, this is no question: We do not distinguish between a prohibition of deriving benefit in the normal manner of eating and other means of deriving benefit except when [eating] is the normal way of deriving benefit. But when it is not the normal way of deriving benefit, it is permitted in all forms. This is the explicit implication of that case. This is also written by Ran: \"I have seen someone who wrote that this implies that one may use anything whose benefit is prohibited rabbinically, such as hametz after Pesah  and crossbred vines outside Eretz Yisrael, even for a non-dangerous malady. However, this does not apply to eating, for perhaps [the Rabbis] made them the equivalent of Torah [prohibitions], banning their usage as a remedy except in cases of danger. But I say that if we are going to make distinctions, perhaps one may not even use things whose benefit is prohibited rabbinically as a remedy in the normal manner of deriving benefit; perhaps Torah prohibitions not in the normal manner of deriving benefit is more lenient than rabbinic prohibitions in the normal manner of deriving benefit.\" Thus, it is explicit that even with regard to Torah prohibitions, there is no distinction between eating and other means of deriving benefit when they are not the normal way of deriving benefit. However, there are grounds to distinguish [between eating and other forms of consumption] even in a case of a rabbinic prohibition when benefit is derived in the normal manner. However, it seems that Ran rules leniently regarding rabbinic prohibitions even when deriving benefit in the normal manner, since he writes, “if we are going to make distinctions.” This implies that he is not inclined to make that distinction. Nevertheless, in the present case, all agree that since benefit is not derived in the normal way, it is permitted to consume even by means of eating, and even for a non-dangerous malady. Yet this rationale does not sufficiently explain those who engage in commerce with it, as one may not derive benefit from it. It must be that it is only forbidden to derive benefit from Jewish corpses, as I have seen in Tosafot on the first chapter of Bava Kama (10a, s.v. “she-hashor”): \"The reason for this is that it is derived from “there died Miriam.” Otherwise, it would also be forbidden to derive benefit from gentile cemeteries, and they would not pasture their cattle there, yet we have seen no such rule. Also, Scripture states: “For their flesh is the flesh of donkeys.”\" We have thus learned that one may use mummy as a remedy, even by eating it normally, even for a malady that is not dangerous. It is permitted to trade it and do business with it, and it is permitted to derive benefit from the graves and shrouds of gentiles. However, it causes ritual impurity through contact and carrying, and regarding the ritual impurity transmitted by being in the same structure (tum’at ohel), there is a dispute, and Maimonides maintains that they do not cause impurity through ohel. For this reason, it makes sense that it would be permitted even in the normal manner of deriving benefit, for there is no prohibition against deriving benefit. However, according to the first rationale, there is a slight difficulty: there are other things mixed into theriac, and yet it is forbidden to eat it on Pesah because of the hametz it contains. So states Maimonides in the Laws of Hametz and Matza. A possible answer is that he only forbade theriac for a healthy person, but someone who is ill, even if there is no danger, it is permitted, since this is not the normal way of deriving benefit, as it contains bitter ingredients. So states Maimonides in chapter 14 of the Laws of Forbidden Foods: “…or if he mixed bitter things like gall and wormwood into [forbidden] libation wine and ate them in their bitter state, he is exempt.” But if he is ill, it is permitted, since the prohibition is merely rabbinic. But in my opinion, it makes no difference, for it is permissible to derive benefit from mummy, since these are the corpses of idolaters from the times of the Egyptians. And regarding the prohibition by failure of commission (issur aseh) against eating the flesh of bipeds, its form has already been ruined, and no dog would eat it, so it reverts to being like the dust of the earth, and is permitted. I have written my humble opinion. "
