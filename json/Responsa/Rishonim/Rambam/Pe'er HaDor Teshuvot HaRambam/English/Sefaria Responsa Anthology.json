            "Question: ",
            "What would our master say on the matter of a bachelor who purchased a beautiful (“yefat to’ar”) slave woman, and she lives within his courtyard. The courtyard is large, and he lives there with his father’s wife and her three young daughters. There is a dispute between him and his brothers. They sued the brother before the judge, and many words were exchanged. Later, his brother informed on him to the judge, saying that he bought a Christian slave woman and converted her, and he secludes himself with her. The slave woman came before the judge, and the judge inquired about her status, to which she responded: “I am a Jewish woman.” The judged offered that she could declare to be Muslim,  but she refused, saying: “I am a Jewish woman, daughter of a Jewish woman.” The judge restored her to him, and he took her to his home. The city is gossiping about him, and she is now living in his house.",
            "Must the rabbinical court remove her from his house, as they are forbidden to seclude themselves, and even if he does not seclude himself with her, because the Torah states: “You shall stand blameless before the Lord and before Israel” (Bamidbar 32:22)? Or may we say that since his father’s wife dwells in the same courtyard, we are not required to remove her from him? And if the rabbinical court must remove her, what would be the reason for her removal? We do not find seclusion forbidden except with an unmarried woman and a non-Jewish woman. Why would we forbid her to live in his house? Does she have the status of a “beautiful captive woman” or not? May our teacher instruct us, and may his heavenly reward be doubled.",
            "Response:",
            "She does not have the status of a beautiful captive woman, because this is a unique status conferred by Torah law, which permitted taking her as a wife at that specific time, namely, during a conquest, while she is still a gentile. The Torah spoke to counter the evil inclination, similar to the way it permitted them, at that time, to eat forbidden foods from the “homes fill with all manner of goodness” (Devarim 6:11), even bacon (Hullin 17a). Thus, this case is incomparable.",
            "The rabbinical court must, due to this bad report, force him to remove her or to emancipate and marry her. Even though this is akin to a sin, because one who is rumored to have slept with a slave woman may not, ab initio, marry her if she has been emancipated, we have already ruled several times on cases such as this that he should emancipate and marry her. We do this to pave the way for those who wish to repent, and we say that it is better for him to eat the sauce than to eat the actual fats. We rely on the words of the Sages: “It is a time to act for God, for they have breached Your Torah” (Tehilim 119:126; Berakhot 54a). We subtly and softly help him marry her, and we set a time by which he must marry her or remove her, as Ezra did (Ezra 10:10-44). ",
            "May God repair our breakdowns, as he promised: “I will remove all of your impurities” (Yeshayahu 1:25).",
            "So writes Moshe. "

            "<b>Question:</b> What does the great, holy Eminence, our master and teacher Moshe, the light of the world, the wonder of our age, may his fame last forever, the son of our great and honored master, Rabbi Maimon, say regarding a city whose sages and prominent members instituted a custom to sit during the public reading of the Ten Commandments from a Torah scroll. This city was previously one with a dearth of wisdom, and when a great rabbi came, he established wisdom there and instituted several improvements.",
            "Before this rabbi arrived, the custom was that all would stand during the public reading of the Ten Commandments from a Torah scroll, in deference to the commandments, but this rabbi abolished that custom and instituted that they sit during the reading, preventing them from standing.",
            "The custom spread from one generation to the next.",
            "A responsum has appeared, with his signature, to someone who asked him about this. He proved his assertion from the fact that the Sages abolished their recitation along with the <i>Shema</i> because of the heretics who say that [the Ten Commandments] are more important than the rest of the Torah.",
            "He stated in his responsum that in general, one who wishes to stand during the reading of the Ten Commandments from a Torah scroll should be reproached, because to do so is the way of heretics who believe that the Ten Commandments have more importance than the rest of the Torah, and because we must distance and separate ourselves from anything that the heretics believe differently from the Sages.",
            "Witness how [the Sages], peace be upon them, said that the <i>kohen</i> who burnt the [red] heifer would be defiled, in order to deflate the morale of the Sadducees. And in several places, [the Sages] instruct us not to give heretics the opportunity to tyrannize—certainly in the present case, which our Sages distanced us from long ago.",
            "A judge from another city, where the local custom was to stand during the reading of the Ten Commandments, was appointed judge and came to this city, and he did not approach this rabbi intelligently. He was appointed judge, and he began standing during the reading, and others followed him. The people of the city said to him: it is not proper for us to change the custom of our fathers and forefathers and to distance ourselves from them regarding what their judge and teacher instituted for them. He is the rabbi, and we and they drink from his waters. Moreover, the Sages stated (<i>Pesahim</i> 50b): ",
            "The people of Bet Shean customarily did not travel from Tyre to Sidon on Friday. Their sons came before R. Yohanan and said to him: “Our fathers had this practice, but it is intolerable for us.” He said to them: “Your fathers have already accepted it upon themselves, and it is written: ‘Heed, my son, the discipline of your father…’ (Mishlei 1:8).",
            "They further stated: “From where is it derived that custom is significant? R. Shimon b. Aba said in R. Yohanan’s name: ‘Heed, my son…’” ",
            "That is, even when it is irrelevant to the legal aspect, we may not ignore the custom of our forefathers and follow the custom of your city. Certainly when it is a matter of dispute and division among us on a matter of <i>halakha</i>, they have said: “Do not cut yourself (<i>lo titgodedu</i>)” means “do not make factions (<i>agudot agudot</i>).” And certainly when the <i>halakha</i> supports us on this matter, for long ago they abolished the recitation along with the <i>Shema</i>, even for one who is sitting, because of the grievances of the heretics. And certainly when we stand and thus differentiate it from the entire Torah, and even become similar to Karaites, who stand during the reading of the Torah. ",
            "He replied: We find that the Israelites, when they heard [the commandments] as God spoke them unto them, they were standing, as it is written: “They stood at the base of the mount” (Shemot 19:17). ",
            "They said: That was only to receive the Almighty and heed His words, as it is written: “Moses went out with the people to meet God.” It is not binding upon us. And if it were obligatory, we would similarly be obligated to stand during the reading of “You are standing (<i>Atem nitzavim</i>),” since they were standing.",
            "He said to them: We find that in Baghdad they stand.",
            "They said to him: That is because the head of the academy or the head of the community is the one reading, and they stand for him. It is possible that some cities follow this practice because they saw the externalities of the custom to stand. Yet even if this would be the custom of the people of Baghdad, we are not obligated to follow it.",
            "Master, instruct us whether we should be concerned about this presently, and what is the grievance that our Sages were concerned about? The Karaites or the Samaritans? For some of them grasp the externalities of all Scripture, and some grasp the externalities of part of it. And what is the value of the Ten Commandments over the rest of the Torah? May this judge abolish the custom of this city so that it may follow his custom, abandoning the ancestral custom? And is his proof for standing from “and they stood” really proof? Teach us, master, and receive double reward.",
            "<b>Reply:</b> That which the deceased rabbi, may he rest in peace, instituted is the proper custom, and his proofs are correct proofs according to the rules of logical men. There is nothing to add to them. It would be proper to do this everywhere that they customarily stand; they must be stopped because of the harm it causes to faith, as some people may imagine that there are various levels of Torah and that some parts are more exalted than other parts. This is a very bad thing. It is proper to block all openings that lead to such unrefined faith. ",
            "The claim of the other sage that in Baghdad and several other cities they did this does not constitute proof. For if there are sick people, we do not make the healthy sick by those people so that all are equal. Rather, we try to operate on every sick person we can. ",
            "The Karaites are not those who the Sages call heretics. Rather, they call them Sadducees and Boethusians, as opposed to the Samaritans and heretics, who lack proper faith in the root of the Torah, for example, by saying that the Torah is not from heaven. We have already explained that there is no difference between one who denies [the divine origin] of the entire Torah and one who denies a single verse and says that Moses said it on his own.",
            "There was a heretic who believed that only the Ten Commandments were from heaven, and the rest of the Torah was said by Moses himself. For this reason, [the Sages] abolished their daily recitation. And it is strictly forbidden to treat part of the Torah as being superior to another. See what we wrote on this in the <i>Commentary on the Mishna</i>, on <i>Helek</i> (<i>Sanhedrin</i> ch. 10). ",
