            "They responded: <i>\"How pious are these generations!\" (Yevamot 39b:15) \"All that Sarah says to you, listen to her voice!\" (Genesis 21:12) \"Go and say to them, return to your tents and bless your God!\" (Deuteronomy 5:27, Nehemiah 9:5)</i> The proof is from Channukah candles and megillah reading. They explained to me that just as in these cases, since the women were involved in the original miracle they are obligated to perform the commandment and recite the blessing, so too with the Lulav, we find that the [entire] Jewish people have only one heart directed to their Father in heaven (Sukkah 45b.9). So too with the Shofar, we are taught that the Holy One said: bring me [verses of] kingship, that I may be your king, and [verses of] remembrance, that the memory of your ancestors come before Me favourably, and all of that, with a Shofar. (Rosh Hashanah 34b.7) Now, women also need to be remembered before Him favourably. Therefore, if they recite the blessings for these commandments, they have permission to do so.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is also the opinion of Rabbeinu Tam, quoted in Tosafot on Rosh Hashanah 33a:5</i> "

Some of the Geonim wrote that this applies to the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> and the study of Torah, but for prayer one needs to immerse or be washed with 9 <i>kav</i> of water<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the opinion of Rav Hai Gaon, quoted in Rif Berakhot 13b:6</i>.

They rely on the Talmudic discussion, where both washing and sexual activity is forbidden on Yom Kippur (Jerusalem Talmud Yoma 8:1). The question is raised regarding the superfluity of both these activities being mentioned, and is resolved by saying that it applies to those localities where immersion was not necessary after seminal emissions. I asked [in my dream] whether it was  possible to rely on the Jerusalem Talmud, and say that the decree of Ezra to immerse was not universally accepted, and only in those places where it was accepted do they need to immerse or rinse before prayer, and in those where it wasn't they don't. Or whether perhaps the law follows the more stringent opinion of the Geonim who say that one always needs ritual immersion or to be washed with 9 <i>kav</i> of water before prayer.",

Do not say that this impurity is any different, because it is intentional and because it comes from within. Ezra, who made this decree of immersion before prayer, saw with the holy spirit before making this decree. Regarding that text in the Jerusalem Talmud, if [Ezra] would stand with them they would not know what to say. In fact, they retracted their words, and said that the entire problematic text was referring to the time before Ezra. This situation [of praying without immersion] is what causes the long exile, for if the prayer of Israel was performed correctly it would have been heard long ago. Only the trials of the exile,  and acts of righteousness, and study of the Torah - these are what Israel have to rely upon. Later, they again responded and said: we have heard a voice from behind the Heavenly curtain saying: To purify all of Israel together may not be possible, but if at least the prayer leader is pure, even that will hasten the redemption. <i>\"In every place where a pure offering is dedicated to Me\" (Malachi 1:11) \"I shall come to you and bless you\" (Exodus 20:21).</i> After seeing all this, on Tuesday night, the 19th of the month of Kislev, I asked whether it had come to me directly from God or not. This was my precise question: Please, exalted King, great and mighty and awesome God, who keeps the covenant and kindness with those He loves. Maintain your covenant and kindness with us, and instruct your holy angels who are assigned to answer dream-questions to respond to my question. May it be a true and correct response, let them speak with clarity and explanations, revealing the law and leaving no doubt. For regarding what I asked about the immersion of one with seminal emissions, did this response emanate from the holy spirit? Do they have practical value, and should I reveal them to my son-in-law, Rabbi Yosef<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Keset Hasofer ad loc., who identifies this son-in-law as Joseph ben Kalonymus</i>, and instruct him to inform all the sages of the land? Or do they come from another spirit, and have no practical value, and it would be better for me to conceal and guard them? They responded: True were the words of God. These words are ancient, the Ancient of Days spoke them, <i>\"Today is the day of revelation, and we have waited until the light of day\" (II Kings 7:9).</i> Later they responded: <i>\"And the one who willingly refuses to listen to the serving priest, that man shall die,\" (Deuteronomy 17:12)</i> and <i>\"I am with you, and I shall guard you in everything you do.\" (Genesis 28:15)</i>"

The blessing of <i>\"La'asok\"</i> relates to the commandment; that of <i>\"Veha'arev\"</i> is a prayer that we merit to learn and teach, while <i>\"Asher Bachar\"</i> is a blessing of thanksgiving, since all Israel is required to give thanks to God who chose them from among the nations and gave them the Torah. There were also two blessings instituted before the recitation of the Shema, in the morning and in the evening, whose essence is also about enjoyment of the Torah. Other blessings however have a short formulation, and they are recited each time after an interruption in the action they refer to. This explains the blessing instituted in honour of the Torah reading in the synagogue, which is <i>\"Asher Bachar\"</i>, and the sages didn't require us to recite the blessing <i>\"La'asok\"</i> on fulfilling a commandment, or the blessing <i>\"Veha'arev,\"</i> which is a prayer.

This is similar to this shepherd who milks and curdles on his own accord, we have no obligation to prevent him from doing so, on account of monetary loss and the suffering of the animals. You could argue that it is similar to that which was taught (Shabbat 16:8): <i>\"If a non-Jew lights a lamp, a Jew may benefit from the light. But if it was lit for the Jew, they may not benefit from it. If the non-Jew draws water for his own animal, a Jew may have his animal drink from it. If it was drawn for the Jew, this is forbidden.\"</i> It would seem from this that the results of labour done by non-Jews are forbidden for Jews when done for their sake, even if it was not asked for. Similarly, the shepherd milks and curdles for the Jew, how then should it be permitted? <i>\"Consider well what is before you.\" (Proverbs 23:1)</i> For when it was taught that the results of actions done for the sake of Jews are forbidden, they are only forbidden for that same day: the animal is forbidden to drink from the water filled for it until the night after Shabbat. So too with the shepherd who milks and curdles - certainly, the milk is forbidden on Shabbat itself, but after Shabbat it becomes permitted. However, in the case of a Jew who bought the yearly milk supply of a non-Jew's flock, then anything the non-Jew added would now be done for the Jew - it is forbidden to keep these cheeses and milk produced on Shabbat. For we know the tale (Shabbat 139b:8) of one scholar who went to sleep on a ferry, and thus crossed the river and inspected the fruits of his orchard, while claiming that he just intended to sleep.
