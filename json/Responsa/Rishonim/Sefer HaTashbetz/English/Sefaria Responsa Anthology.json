                "Tunis. To Rabbi Yosef b. Abba, may God protect him. You have asked whether one may slaughter the offerings of the Ishmaelites (=Muslims) on their behalf and to eat from it.",
                "Response: The Ishmaelites are not idolaters, which would render their offerings the offerings of the dead (zivhei metim). This was stated by the Ge’onim. Although in the times of the Sages their offerings were offerings were the offerings of the dead, as stated in the third chapter of Hullin (38b) and the first chapter of Avoda Zara (32b), even though they were the offerings of the dead, if a Jew performed the slaughter, it is not forbidden, because we follow R. Yose, as stated there (Hullin 39b). ",
                "Nevertheless, it seems that it would be forbidden for a Jew to sacrifice their paschal lamb, because this is an established commandment for them, and we do not leave Noahides  to add on to their seven commandments. For it is stated in the chapter “Arba Mitot” (Sanhedrin 58b): “A Noahide who observes Shabbat is liable for death.” The same applies to any other commandment, as Maimonides wrote in the Laws of Kings (10:9). If so, how can a Jew slaughter on their behalf? He must prevent them! Indeed, the Sages stated (Avoda Zara 6b): “It is forbidden to hand to a Noahide a limb from a living animal; even though one does not transgress “placing a stumbling block before the blind” unless they are standing on opposite sides of the river,  as noted in the first chapter of Avoda Zara (ibid.), it is nevertheless forbidden to aid them, for indeed there is a duty to separate them [from the violation]. Tosafot stated similarly in the first chapter of Shabbat. And if this lamb is akin to the paschal offering, a commemoration of the Akeida,  then it is indeed a sacrifice. Non-Jews may offer sacrifices on their altars as long as it is not a fixed commandment. Therefore, if a Jew slaughters it, he is slaughtering sacred property outside the Temple precincts, and thereby incurs the punishment of extirpation (karet), even if the sacred property is the offering of a gentile. Similarly, one who eats from it is eating from sacred property outside of the Temple precincts. ",
                "Zevahim, in the chapter “Dam Hatat” (116b), the Talmud states: “Nowadays, gentiles may do so”—that is, they may sacrifice upon a private altar—“therefore, each one may build himself an altar and offer whatever he wants upon it. R. Yaakov b. Aha said in the name of R. Asi: But it is forbidden to assist them and act as their agents.” The Talmud only permitted instructing them how to perform the sacrifice in purity, as is stated there: “Rava said: It is permitted to instruct them.” Maimonides wrote the same at the end of the Laws of the Preparation of Offerings, and Ra’avad did not object that he wrote that the liability is karet even though the Talmud merely states that it is prohibited. ",
                "In the chapter “Ha-ba al Yevimto” (Yevamot 63b), it is said about the magi that came to Babylonia that they exhume the dead because there was rejoicing on their festivals. This implies that it is forbidden to rejoice with them on their festival, and we find no distinction in this regard between idolaters and those who are not idolaters. Therefore, even if this lamb would not be considered a sacrifice, the law would forbid dealing with [the gentiles] to join them in the slaughter and eating. Moreover, since they must slaughter their animals facing south, even on non-festival days, one who slaughters on their behalf incurs the penalty of lashes for violating “do not walk in the ways of the gentiles.”",
                "Rashba wrote in a responsum that it is proper to rebuke one who slaughters on an altar in the Ishmaelite custom. However, since they are not idolaters, one may do business with them prior to their festivals, as stated in the last chapter of Avoda Zara (65a): R. Yehuda sent an offering to the house of Adirban, and so too Rava sent an offering to the house of Bar-Shishak on his festival, saying that he knows for certain that Bar-Shishak is not an idolater. ",
                "An animal that a gentile purchased for this paschal offering may be bought from them [by a Jew], for even if it was bought to be offered to a pagan deity, it is not rendered forbidden, for a gentile cannot render something sacred by mere proclamation, as stated in the chapter “Kol Ha-tzelamim.” It is not considered set aside for pagan worship until [the animal] is fed from the cress of pagan practice, or handed to the priests, or shorn in the name of pagan practice, as stated in Temura, in the chapter “Kol Ha-asurin” (29a).
