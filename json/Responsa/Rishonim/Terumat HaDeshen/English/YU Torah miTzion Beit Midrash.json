                "Question: In many places, individuals and even Torah scholars conduct the bulk of their Purim meal ‎at night, going to shul and davening minchah but not maariv, then returning home and beginning ‎their meal by day and continuing into the night, such that most of the meal is at night. Is there logic ‎behind this custom, or not?‎",
                "Answer: It appears to me that one should find some reason and support for this custom. I have ‎found a responsum which says, \"I have heard from R' Toviah in the name of Riva that when youths ‎take food from each other, even without permission, for the joy of Purim, from the time the ‎megilah is read until the night of the Purim feast - two nights and one day - there is no issue of ‎surreptitious or overt theft. They should not be summoned to court and there is no concern, so ‎long as they do not overstep the practices established by the town councillors.\" It is clear that the ‎second night is legitimately part of the Purim feast. The question remains for Riva himself, fort he ‎second night is the 15th of Adar, and how could one fulfill the meal of the 14th on the 15th?... ‎Apparently, the reason is that the reading of the megilah on the morning of the 14th takes time, ‎and then one is busy sending portions and giving gifts to the indigent, and there is no time to eat a ‎meal with joy and pleasure. Therefore, our predecessors established part of the meal in the ‎evening, starting it during the day before maariv so as to fulfill the mitzvah of the feast during the ‎day, which is the essential time. One then continues during the time he has available, enjoying the ‎meal until night and at night, and the whole is one meal. We have found a similar practice of ‎nullifying a mitzvah meal for the sake of other mitzvot in Tosafot Chullin 83a, which asks why the ‎mishnah there did not include a meal for the first day of Succot among the four occasions when ‎people regularly eat large meals. He explained that it is because people are busy with the mitzvot ‎of Succah and Lulav on the day before Yom Tov, and so they did not prepare big meals for the first ‎day of Succot.Although I have justified this custom, still, my mentors customarily eat the essential ‎meal in the morning, as do I, and it appears that this is the practice in the Rhineland.‎"
