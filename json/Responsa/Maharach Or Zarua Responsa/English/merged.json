            "<b>Q</b> - Why is it customary for some people to recite a benediction when putting on their small prayer shawl (Talith) at home, and repeat the benediction at synagogue, when putting on the larger prayer shawl even though they are still wearing the smaller prayer shawl?<br>I personally observed the custom of Rabbi Meir of Rothenburg wherein he wore the smaller prayer shawl and recited the benediction, only upon returning home from synagogue.<br>signed: Mosheh b. Jacob HaLevi.",
            "<b>A</b> - The reason for the double recitation of the benediction is that the person may have spoken in the interum. One benediction can suffice for both prayer shawls only if there was no interruption between the time the small prayer shawl was first worn at home until the larger prayer shawl was put on in synagogue; and there must be intent when reciting the benediction over the small prayer shawl, that the benediction shall include the large prayer shawl as well."

            "<b>Q</b> - A negotiated a marriage between his daughter L, and B. B was to give as a dowry 3 Pounds and a prayer book, which he had in Regensburg. L's relatives refused to allow the wedding to take place unless B's brother-in-law C, would agree to bind himself by a Herem, that he would bring these articles. The Herem was administered to C in the absence of a quorum of 10 people. The wedding took place but C failed to bring these articles, because the trustees in Regensburg refused to give him these articles. Must C be penalized for breaking the oath?<br>signed: R. Jonathan.<br><b>A</b> - C is not to be penalized because: 1) The Herem was not administered before 10 or more people, and therefore was not binding. 2) One does not become a surety for the benefit of the bride by a mere verbal agreement. 3) The trustees refused to give the articles to C. He was thus prevented by force major from fulfilling his pledge, and is not to be held legally responsible for it."

A requested B to pledge that the transaction would be completed only through A and that A would still receive a commission of 6 pounds (Layish) even if the deal would be consummated through the efforts of another person. B agreed and A sent a messenger 14 miles, in order to contact the seller. A succeeded in bringing both the seller and B together. B's relatives demanded from A a share of his commission. They threatened to stop the sale unless A would comply with their demand. When A refused to be intimidated, they declared that this parcel was mortgaged to gentiles. While A was investigating this claim, the transaction was completed without him. A brought suit against the seller and the decision was in his favor. A now wants his commission from B.",
            "B claims that he should not be required to pay A any commission because of the following reasons: He did not purchase the land. Furthermore, even if he did make a promise to B (as B claims), this promise was not accompanied by an act of Kinyan (an act that creates obligations and rights), nor were there any witnesses present. B disputes A's claim that A sent for the seller, and as a proof he cites the fact, that although the sale was completed, the seller did not pay A for the messenger. B maintains that this land was sold to someone else and A had nothing to do with the sale because the seller refused to have A act as his agent upon learning that A lied when he said that the buyer had deposited with him valuables as a pledge, which of course was not true. As for A's claim that he won the verdict in a suit against the seller, B says that the judge merely awarded A money for the effort he expended. This decision was based on misinformation, because A is a rich man, and is not an agent by profession. A incurred no expenses in this transaction, because he did not even leave the city. Finally, when both B and the seller discovered that A lied to them, they refused to have A represent them as their agent.",
            "<b>A</b> - Any person who makes an agreement with an agent (or in case of marriage with a matchmaker) and binds himself by mere verbal promise, must pay in full for the services rendered, even if it was not accompanied by an act of Kinyan. An agent is entitled to the full amount agreed upon, and not merely for his expenses, or for the actual work that he has performed."

If the court of appeal should decide that the judge did not err in a law cited in a Mishna (or a basic legal principle) but rather in the weighing of conflicting opinions, then since the litigants had originally agreed to abide by the decision of the judge, and asked him to arbitrate rather than render his decision according to strict law <img> the decision is binding, regardless of the manner of its rendition and the judge need not compensate the injured party out of his own pocket, even if he had personally enforced his decision.<br>If, however, it were a case where the court consisted of three lay judges, or a single authorized judge, and the case was tried without the consent of the litigants, the decision remains valid, even if the court of appeal decided that the verdict was based on an error in the weighing of conflicting opinions.

Furthermore, they demand that the relatives of S should pay for the loss they inflicted upon M and C, expecially when the former complained to the authorities quite some time after the incident, thus voiding any claim that the relatives of S acted in the heat of anger.<br><b>A</b> - Although M and C were seen whispering to X, when they came to a Jewish court after their eviction from the banquet, in order to lodge a complaint, there was no proof presented by valid witnesses to the effect that they induced X to have the Gentiles come and murder S. Even if they had done so, they would not be held responsible, since X should not have heeded this advice. Therefore anyone who calls M and C murderers should be rebuked.<br>A ban, however, should not be pronounced against any person who slanders M and C, because this ban will certainly be violated and we do not wish to \"place a stumbling block before the blind\".<br>X, who was actually responsible for inducing the Gentiles to riot and kill, should be considered a murderer, and his name should be blackened and maligned in every community that he is known.<br>M and C are therefore not to be accused of murder, and you may quote this decision in my name, in any community you so desire.<br>The Jewish courts can not hold the relatives of S liable for the losses they caused M and C by their accusations, since reparations by an informer are considered fines that can not be enforced outside of the land of Israel. Although, if such actions were to become prevalent, they would then come to be considered a form of tort called Garmi (damage which is certain to occur although done indirectly) for which the damager is held responsible, even in our day. However, thank G-d we have not heard about complaints being lodged with the authorities in cases of murder, until now, and there is therefore no fear that such complaints may become prevalent.<br>The claim of M and C, that the relatives of S had not acted in the rage of anger, since they had complained to the authorities quite some time after the unfortunate incident, can not be upheld - since there is no time limit in the case of murder, as to what constitutes acting in the heat of anger.<br>Both the relatives of S, and M and C, should leave the entire dispute in the hands of R.

We do not presume now that she is in possession of the ring, that she stole the ring, but maintain that she accepted it as the token of betrothal.

A was accused of vilification and defamation, and indemnity is being sought for the mortification and abuse which resulted. Furthermore, A had the room sealed by an order of a Gentile court and thus caused her damage. L now demands recompense for the loss incurred.<br><b>A</b> - According to Talmudic law, when a woman claims that her husband is impotent, although she may have been married to him for ten years, and is willing to forfeit all claims to the Ketubah, the husband is not coerced to grant her a divorce, since we suspect that the only reason she is demanding a divorce is that she found an attachment with another man and wishes to marry him.<br>However, a Takanah of the Saboraim decrees that a husband is immediately coerced to divorce a rebellious wife, lest she turn to evil ways.<br>Since L rebelled against her husband and avers that she dispises him, A is coerced to divorce her, as stated in the Takanah of the Saboraim. All the possesions of the couple shall become the sole property of A, including that which L brought in to her husband as dowry. However, L's own property, to which her husband has had merely the right of usufruct, and property which she just inherited, is not awarded to A.<br>According to the Takanah, A must divorce L. Therefore, when A vowed to divorce L by a certain date, and failed to do so, he need not pay a fine, when he eventually gives her the divorce. This time limit was merely intended as a means of encouragement.<br>The Rabbis of the city, and not I, can best ascertain the indemnity that should be paid by A for the abuse and mortification. The circumstances which precipitated the insults, as well as the position and prestige of those insulted, warrant the careful study and consideration by the judges.<br>Since all the property (with those exceptions mentioned above and which presumably were not involved) is awarded to A, after he divorces L, the latter's request for recompence is denied, inasmuch as the losses caused by A's action affected only A's property.<br>Your messenger asked me to inform you, whether or not, I have received any correspondence concerning this case. I give you my word of honor, that I had no prior information whatsoever (neither written, oral, nor even by intimation) about this matter.

This money was to be given to A's friend B, who would hold it in trust for A.

Because of this protest, A now seeks to invalidate the divorce, since it was granted under duress.<br>(2) The letter \"vov\" was missing from A's name in the bill of divorcement. Does this necessarily invalidate the divorce?<br><b>A</b> - (1) The previous protest of A may not be valid for the following reasons: 1 - Since A agreed to accept money, we may assume that he fully agreed to grant the divorce out of his own free will. 2 - The witnesses before whom the the protest was lodged, could not state with certainty, that A did not grant the divorce out of his own free will, since the fact that A agreed to take money disproves their contention.<br>Furthermore, inasmuch as A consented to accept money, it is possible that he no longer wanted L as his wife, but was actually desirous of granting her a divorce. After B received the money from Naftali, A issued the divorce without making any stipulation whatsoever. Although A revealed the intention of not wanting to divorce L, without receiving money, nevertheless, the law prevails according to Abaye, who holds that revealing of intention in respect of a divorce, makes no difference. (Gitin 34a). Therefore, Naftali could even have demanded that B return the money without invalidating the bill of divorcement.<br>Some authorities have found fault with this divorce. R. Hayyim Eliezer therefore, insisted that since there was a strong possibility that the divorce was valid, A is to be coerced to give L a second divorce for the following reasons: there is no doubt that the first divorce which A issued, may have validity. Therefore, it is forbidden for L to dwell together with A (since one is not permitted to live together with an unmarried woman). A must then be forced to give her another divorce, inasmuch as L can not live with A, nor may she marry another man. For A's own good, we would advise him to grant this divorce willingly, and without having the court resort to coercion.<br>R. Hayyim Eliezer adds: I personally observed how R. Meir b. Baruch had ordered a husband to divorce his rebellious wife, without paying her the Ketubah, while the husband was awarded only the property which he had brought into marriage. When incidents of rebellious wives increased, R. Meir sent word to R. Yedidiah, who was then in Spiers, to have the three communities convene for a synod. The purpose was to pass an ordinance to the effect that a rebellious wife should lose even the possessions which she had brought into marriage.

Manoah verbally pressured A to go through with the divorce. A appointed B as an agent to present L with the bill of divorcement. A cancelled the bill of divorcement before R. Isaac alone. Later, R. Manoah took the bill of divorcement from A and gave it to B. When A and B arrived at the city where L was, A again cancelled the divorce. B did not give the bill of divorcement to L. Instead, R. Manoah ordered that A, and not B, should give the bill of divorcement to L. A refused to comply and R. Manoah issued a ban against A, effective in that city. A nevertheless continued to shout defiance and protests against the divorce. He told people that his wife had informed him that she does not want to be divorced. A maintained that he wants L as his wife, and would not divorce her, even if he would have to lose all of his money. Two weeks later, R. Manoah issued a ban against B, and ordered him to return to that city. L's father took her to that city, and A also came there. A, in the presence of B, revoked the latter's power as an agent for the former. Nevertheless, R. Manoah ordered B to give L the bill of divorcement.<br>R. Hayyim Eliezer makes the following comments on R. Isaac's account of the case:<br>Even though A was compelled by his relatives and R. Manoah to grant a divorce to his wife, if L had refused to live with A, the bill of divorcement does not become void. The ordinance of the Saboraim, which dates back more than 300 years, dictates that when a woman refuses to live with her husband, the latter is coerced to immediately grant her a divorce. Only physical or economic methods that are employed to force a man to issue a divorce, constitute coercion. Therefore, even if L was not averse to living with A, the divorce, in this case, is not void on the grounds of cocercion, inasmuch as A's relatives and R. Manoah had merely exerted verbal pressure on A.<br>The cancellation which A invoked against the bill of divorcement, after having given it to B, has no effect, as it was pronounced only in the presence of R. Isaac. In addition, the formula of cancellation was most ambiguous.<br>Since it was not necessary for A to personally give the bill of divorcement directly to B, R. Manoah did not err, when he took the bill of divorcement from A. and presented it to B.<br>You did not inform me regarding the wording of the formula of cancellation pronounced by A, when both he and B arrived in the city where L was staying, nor did you say before whom this cancellation was pronounced.<br>However, from the latter part of your letter, it would seem that this bill of divorcement should be absolutely void.<br>Nevertheless, R. Monaoh, in his letter to me, described a different account of what had transpired. R. Manoah's account:<br>R. Isaac came to R. Manoah, after the bill of divorcement was written, and asked the latter to instruct A to appoint an agent, for the purpose of delivering the divorce to L. Both R. Isaac and R. Manoah went to A, who thereupon appointed Samuel b. Jacob HaCohen to act as A's agent. A renounced all future cancellations that he might invoke against the divorce, and announced before more than two score people present, that he had willfully ordered this bill of divorcement to be written. A then gave the divorce to the agent, with specific orders to give it to L. Later, we sent for L and the agent informing them that the divorce should take place here in Vladmir. We ordered A to personally give L the bill of divorcement, but he refused to comply. Likewise in Cologne, we ordered him to do so, and again he refused. We then instructed the agent to give L the bill of divorcement. The agent carried out all of our instructions, and gave L the bill of divorcement in the presence of the leaders of the city.<br>R. Hayyim Eliezer feels that R. Manoah's account of the episode, nonetheless, requires further study and examination. However, R. Hayyim Eliezer maintains that L should not be permitted to remarry, until all the ambiguities in the case are cleared up."

If the articles were not seen in A's possession, and L took an oath on her ketubah, we accept A's contention, since A could have claimed that he purchased these items from L, after she took her oath on her ketubah. However, if witnesses are able to testify that these articles were obtained by A by seizure, or were deposited with the latter, A could no longer claim that he had purchased these items.<br>L can not demand payment for her ketubah from the estate inherited by B.

Therefore, the burden of payment rests upon the Gentile and not the community. If the Gentile had died, the Jewish money lenders would then be unable to collect the loan from the community, even if witnesses had testified that the money was given directly to the community. It was not necessary for the community to actually stipulate that the money was borrowed in accordance with civil law, since it was tacitly understood that the community was acting in a manner in which it would be permissible for the Jewish money lenders to collect interest on the loan."

The document was then to be held by A's agent, heir, or heir's agent until such time as A would send the share, plus payment for all damages thereby incurred. Thereupon the document was to be returned to C. All the aforesaid which applied to A, [concerning his failure to transmit his partner's share] was applicable to B as well. Whichever partner collected the payment from the burghers, was required to transmit the other's share through the medium of C. A and B agreed to accept C's affirmation that one partner paid the other, his share. A, B and C promised by solemn hand-clasp to abide by the stipulations as set forth in the agreement of partnership.<br>Subsequent to the first payment made by the burghers, the king died. B was pressed for money. Prior to the second payment, B dispatched his agent to A, and requested the latter to contact the burghers, and negotiate a settlement wherein the burghers would repay the debt in one installment, at a reduced rate. A brought B's agent before the burghers, and the latter offered to settle the loan for a specified amount. B's agent, aware of B's financial plight, showed a willingness to accept the settlement, but A objected and demanded a higher sum from the burghers. B's agent returned to B.<br>The burghers decided to pressure A into accepting the settlement that was proposed to B's agent, and more than 200 burghers descended upon A's house. The burghers threatened violence, unless A would agree to the terms of their settlement. A fled the city and sought refuge in a fortress from whence he felt he could better negotiate with them. The burghers tried to abduct A's children and family, but the latter hid in the City Hall. The burghers found the keys to A's house and threatened to forcefully take A's family from the City Hall. Thereupon A reluctantly acquiesced to the burgher's terms. In addition, A was forced to cancel all debts which the burghers had owed A, his sons, and his sons-in-law. A would not have been forced to cancel these debts, had B's agent not demonstrated a willingness to accept the burgher's terms for settlement.<br>After A concluded the negotiations with the burghers, he sent B a report of all that had transpired. A instructed B to come and collect his share of the money. B, however, refused to accept any adjustment whatsoever, and demanded his annual share.<br>The burghers were under the impression that the promissory note was in B's possession, and did not demand its return from A, since they had not as yet, paid the entire settlement.<br>B again related to A about the former's dire need for money. A thereupon, sent B his annual share, plus a substantial amount. A stipulated that should the court decide in his favor, then the money he sent B should go toward the full payment. However, should the verdict be in B's favor, then A requested that he be given an extention of time to make further payments to the former.<br>B then informed C about the proposal of A. C, [who was entrusted with the promissory note, and collected B's share of the loan, from A,] replied that B had received sufficient money [from A] to cover the third annual payment, [which was not due,] and furthermore, it was not time to summon the sureties. C requested the opportunity to seek advice regarding the abrogation of his trust, and assured B that he would faithfully carry out his responsibility. C agreed to go to court and abide by its decision, should B refuse to accept the former's proposition.<br>B nevertheless, summoned the sureties. The burghers suddenly remembered that they were not in possession of the promissory note, when they learned that the sureties were commencing to eat [and were charging the food they consumed to the account of the burghers]. Thereupon, they rang the [church] bells and a large crowd responded to the call. Armed with swords and lances, the burghers again descended on A's house. The burghers forced A to promise either to free them from any damage [caused when the sureties charged food to the burgher's account] or to deliver the promissory note to the former. The sureties had already consumed food worth more than 100 pounds.<br>A thereupon deposited with C, a pledge valued in excess of B's share, of the fourth payment, and C then gave the promissory note to the former. A was obliged to pay for whatever the sureties had already consumed (while some of the sureties were still continuing to eat).<br>A suffered all this damage when B summoned the sureties, despite the former's assurance that he would heed the decision of the court [in regard to the adjustment A had made with the burghers].<br>A demands the right to withhold the pledge until B agrees to go to court for adjudication. C requests assistance in having his trust abrogated, and inquires whether he should deposit the pledge (which is now a substitutue for the promissory note) with A, until B pays for the damage he caused A, inasmuch as B had violated the conditions, as set forth in the agreement of partnership. C maintains that A's action [in negotiating the settlement with the burghers] was the result of unavoidable circumstances, while B [upon summoning the sureties] had acted with malice and intent to cause damage to A.<br>signed: Ephraim b.

B returned to A, and informed the latter that he would try to sell A's library at the highest possible price, insofar as they were both relatives. B guaranteed A a minimum of 44 pounds, and assured the latter that B would give him everything in excess of the 44 pounds, that B might receive by arranging the sale. A acquiesced to B's terms, and the latter sold the library_for 46 pounds. A avers that B gave him only 44 pounds and now demands the two additional pounds from the latter.

This dispute waged between the two parties, for a long time. Finally a settlement, accompanied by a kinyan (a symbolic act which makes an agreement binding) was reached between A, and E and F, wherein the latter would have possession of the land during a period of 3 years.

Hayyim Eliezer notes that the writ of settlement merely stated that a kinyan was made wherein E would not sell the land. Such a kinyan constitutes only an agreement on words (no transfer of a tangible object being agreed upon) and thus has no legal consequences. Therefore, the sale of the land by E is not invalidated.
