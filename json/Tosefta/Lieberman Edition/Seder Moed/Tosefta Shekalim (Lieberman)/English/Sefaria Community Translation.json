            "On the 15th of this [month] the officials of the court go and dig wells, cisterns, caves, and fix the basins and aqueducts of water. Any pool of water that has 40 sea [water] in it is suitable for making an [ritual] immersion bath. But in every pool of water in which there aren't 40 seas [water], one must lead a water channel and fill it up to 40 Sea, so that it becomes suitable for making a [ritual] immersion bath ",

If [a] man found mixed crops in a vineyard, it is lawful as \"robbery\" and free from tithes; but is in the field it is forbidden as \"robbery\" and he is obliged to pay tithes.",

On does not set the marking in a place of uncleanness but in a place of purity, and whoever tents it is unclean. If he had found one marked stone, although one it is not done so, whoever tents [the place] between them is unclean, but above them - he is clean. One does not mark for [a piece of] flesh from a dead man, nor for a bone from a dead man, for they do not defile because of tent [impurity]; rather one marks only for the vertebral column and the skull, because they defile because of tent [impurity].

            "From the time they sat in the temple, they began to pawn. The Israelites were impounded for their shekels, with, of them the congregational sacrifices would be offered from. A parable[: What is this like?] for one who developed an ulcer on his leg; and a doctor tied him up and made an incision on his leg to heal it. So also said the Holy One, blessed be He: The Israelites shall be taken in pledge because of their shekels, those congregational sacrifices may be offered by them, for congregational sacrifices bring atonement and reconciliation between the Israelites and their Father who is in heaven. And likewise, we find in the offering of the Shekels that the Israelites paid in the desert, for it says: \"And you shall taketh money of atonement from the children of Israel\", etc. ",
            "It is lawful to buy congregational sacrifices from Gentiles for money. And one may accept from burnt offerings and peace offerings, poultry, and grain offerings, wood, frankincense and salt [These are] words of R. Akiba. R. Jose the Galilean said to him: Even if you spend all day in interpreting the scripture [you will not find any proof of it]; one accepts only burnt offerings and peace offerings from them, but one does not accept a voluntary donation for the dedication of the temple repair fund; but if they have [already] consecrated it, their consecration is [valid] consecration.",
            "Guardians who have paid the shekel for infants - they are obliged to pay an agio. Whoever pays a shekel [piece] is obliged to pay an agio. [These are] words of R. Me'ir; but the sages say: Whoever pays a shekel [piece] is free of paying an agio. Whoever pays two denarii [as a shekel tax] is liable to an agio, Whoever has given a sela to [recieve as surplus] a shekel is liable to 2 agios, [These are] words of R. Me'ir; but the sages say: just one agio. How much is [the] agio? [Answer] A Silber-Ma'a, [this is] the 24th part of a Sela [these are the] words of R. Me'ir; but the [other] sages say: Half a Ma'a of four Issar. What happened to these agios? They came to the Shekel [These are the] words of R Me'ir. R El'azar says: [They were considered] a voluntary donation. R Shimon Schezori says: [They were used for the] gold plates for cladding of the temple. Ben Azzai says: The money changers took them as their wages.",

            "If [one] has set aside [a certain coin for] his shekel [tax] and spent it, he has committed embezzlement. If he spends [the coin for] another's shekel [tax], then he has committed embezzlement. If he bought for it the two doves of the male sufferers from gonorrhea, the two doves of female sufferers from flux, or the two doves of women who have recently given birth, his sin offering or his Passover offering or his reparation sacrifice, or [one pays the shekel [tax] which he [takes] from the temple property, because he bought [something] for it, embezzlement has been committed, [These are] words R.

The surplus of poor [is to be] for the poor, the surplus of captives for captives; but if he has said: \"For this poor man\" or: \"For this prisoner\", then their surplus belongs to him. The surplus of the dead [is to be] used for the dead; a dead man's surplus is for his heirs. R.Me'ir says: The surplus of a dead man is to be put aside until Elijah comes. R. Natan says [Of] a dead man's surplus, a memorial is built on his grave, or perfumes his bier. One must not spend [money collected for a certain] article of clothing on another article of clothing, and one may not ransom a prisoner in place of another prisoner, however, one may not offend the stewards regarding this matter."

            "What does it mean \"half [פרס]\" before Passover and \"half [פרס]\" before Pentecost and \"half [פרס]\" before of Tabernacles? R. Yose the son of R. Yehuda says: Not less than fifteen days before the [relevant] pilgrimage festival. And why is it written on the baskets [which contain the shekels in the temple] \"Alef, Beit, Gimel\"? They write \"Alef, Beit, Gimel\" on it, because they started with the first and bring out of it. When the first was empty, you bring out from the second. When the second was empty, you bring out from the third. When all three were empty, and the time came to separate the [next] appropriation, one gives from the new, but if not, from the old one.",
            "He went in to give the chamber appropriation, and they examine him as he goes in and as he comes out and converses with him from the moment he goes to the moment he comes out, to fulfill what is said: \"Be clean before God and before Israel\" And [further] it says: \"And do what is right and what is good in the eyes of God\" What is good - in the eyes of heaven, and what is right - in the eyes of men. [These are] words of R. Akiba. And it [further] says: \"And find favor and goodwill in the eyes of God and of men\"  R. Ishmael says The right thing [means also here:] in the eyes of heaven. The sages decided [that] the words of R. Ishmael [should be] supported, for it says: \"For thou shalt do what is right in the sight of God,\" and here [it says] not “that Quality\". And it says: \"God, God, YHWH, God, God, YHWH, he knows, and may Israel know\". ",
            "He made the first [appropriation] and said [thereby]: \"This is from the land of Israel for all Israel!\" Then he covered [that which is left] with blankets, because the people come from Syria and pay the shekel on it. He made the second [appropriation] and said [at the same time]: \"This is from Ammon and Moab and from the cities neighboring the land of Israel!\" Then he covers [that which is left] with blankets, because the people come from Babylon and pay the shekel on it.",
            "He made the third [appropriation] and said [thereby]: \"This is in the name of Babylon and in the name of Media and the far-off lands for all Israel!\" and he didn't cover. This [basket] was the richest of all, for there they found staters of gold and δαρεικός of gold. [Then] he pulled the blankets away and the remains got mixed up. But he did not mix with it the leftovers from the previous year, for perhaps someone had to separate [again] and they will be found giving from the old.",
            "The appropriation can be given from what is pledged, what is collected and what is yet to be collected. [These are] words of R. Me'ir. But R. Yose says: One separates for what is raised and for what is to be raised.  R. Shimon b. Elazar says: This is only done with the last [appropriation], because perhaps some of the children of Israel will still be in a position to have to pay the shekel tax, and [then] he would pay it together with the people from Babylon. One commits embezzlement with them throughout their year, When their year is up, you don't commit embezzlement with them [anymore].

If the first man built it but did not use it when he died, his successor, although he had not yet used it, does not use it, but tears it down and builds another in its place.

If a man dedicates his property, and there are among them things fit for some congregational sacrifice, they are given to the craftsmen as wages, [These are] words of R. Akiba.

The worker who has done his work, whether for a 100 or for 200 [Zuz/Dinar], must not say: Give me this cow for a mine and this coat for 50 Zuz, for sacred things is not profaned by a job, but only by money.

And the proceeds go to the temple repair fund with the rest of the fortune. R. Yehoshua says: The male [animals] themselves are sacrificed as burnt offerings, but the female [animals] are sold for the need of sacrifices for salvation, and for their proceeds burnt offerings should be offered. R. Yose said: The words of R. Yehoshua are the same as the words of R. Eliezer.",

Everyone who had sold them wine, oil or fine flour and said \"give me the money from the currency circulating in my province !\" no one would listen to him.

He is entitled to say to him: \"Give me immediately for a discount!\" There is no interest here, and one does not need to have concerns that it is a question of sacred things, [It is similar] also with one who sells an object to another under the condition that he pays him within twelve months, [also] he is entitled to say to him: \"Give me immediately at a discount!\" There is no interest here.",

The seven Keys of the Court were in their hands, If any of them wanted to open, he could not do so until all had assembled, [Then] the Amarkalim open, and the treasurers go in and come out, and they go in and come out according to their order of rank out. R. Yehuda said: Why is his name Amarkal? Because he is Lord (אמר) of everything (כל). Eligible [for these offices were people] from the ranks of the priests as well as the Levites and the [ordinary] Israelites. If someone has a son, he has priority, a brother, he has priority. Everyone who has priority in inheritance also has priority in office, provided that he lives according to the customs of his ancestors. ",

If you offer them outside, you are free And if ever mand said: I have those two sticks for the altar, so the priest takes them from him and offers them on the altar. They do not benefit from it, but they commit embezzlement with them. If they are offered outside, one is guilty. [These are] Words of Rabbi.
