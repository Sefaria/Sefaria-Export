            "An egg that was laid on Yom Tov: Others said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer [that] both it and its mother may be eaten [on Yom Tov]. A calf that was born on Yom Tov: It is permitted to slaughter it on Yom Tov because it renders itself permitted. A chick that hatches on Yom Tov: It is permitted to slaughter it on Yom Tov because it renders itself permitted.",
            "One who slaughters a chicken [on Yom Tov] and found fully developed eggs inside of it -- behold, they are permitted.",
            "An egg where most of it has come out on the eve of Yom Tov -- even though it was fully out on Yom Tov, it is permitted [to eat on Yom Tov]. [If] it was laid on Shabbat, it may be eaten on Yom Tov. [If] it was laid on Yom Tov, it may be eaten on Shabbat. Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer, Still there are  arguments in that regard; just as it is prohibited to eat [the egg], so too it is prohibited to handle it. Just as [where there is] a doubt [whether or not] it is prohibited, so too [something] that has a doubt [of whether or not] it was \"prepared\" [before Yom Tov] is prohibited [on Yom Tov]. [If this egg] were to be mixed with even one hundred, all [the eggs] would be prohibited."
