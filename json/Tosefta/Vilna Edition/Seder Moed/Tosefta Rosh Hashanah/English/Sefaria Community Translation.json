            "<i>Nisan</i> is the beginning of the year for kings and for [the three pilgrimage] festivals and for months and for the collection of shekels and there are those who say even for home rentals. How is it the beginning for kings? If a king dies in <i>Adar</i> and they appoint a successor while it is still <i>Adar</i>, a year of reigning is counted for the former king and the current one.  [Similarly], if a king dies in <i>Nisan</i> and they appoint a successor while it is still <i>Nisan</i> a year [of reigning] is counted for the former king and the current one. [However], if a king dies in <i>Adar</i> and they appoint a successor only in <i>Nisan</i>, the first year is counted for the first king and the second is counted for the second king.",

            "14 In the beginning, they would accept testimony of the new moon from any person. One time, the Baytusim hired two witnesses to come and trick the rabbis, because the Baytusim believe that Atzeret [Shavuot] can only be on the first day of the week. One [witness] came and said his testimony, and left. The second came and said, \"I was going up to Ma'ale Adumim and I saw it [the new moon] crouched between two rocks. Its head was like that of a calf, its ears were like that of a goat, its horns were like that of a deer, and its tail was resting between its legs. I saw, and I was frightened, and I fell backwards. And [if you don't believe me] here are two hundred zuz wrapped up in my cloak.\" They said to him, \"The two hundred zuz are given to you as a gift, and the one who hired you should be stretched out to be given lashes. What did you see that you did this?\" He said to them, \"Because I heard that the Baytusim wanted to trick the rabbis, and I said, better that I should go and let the rabbis know.\" "

            "The order of blowing [the shofar] is thus: three sets of three by three. The measure of a <i>teki'ah</i> blast is like three <i>teru'ah</i> blasts; while the measure of each<i>teru'ah</i> blast is like three sobs (<i>yevavot</i>). If one heard six <i>teki'ah</i> blasts and three <i>teru'ah</i> blasts - even at intervals, and even spread out over the entire day - the obligation is fulfilled. If one heard a <i>teki'ah</i> from one and a <i>teru'ah</i> from another, even at intervals, and even spread out over the entire day - the obligation is fulfilled. If one heard the shofar blasts and the blessings - whether the blessings preceded the blasts or vice versa, the obligation is fulfilled. If one blew a <i>teki'ah</i>, a <i>teru'ah</i> and then a <i>teki'ah</i>, and then completed the set with [only] a <i>teru'ah</i> and a<i>teki'ah</i> - this only counts as one set. And if one blew a <i>teki'ah</i>, a <i>teru'ah</i> and then a <i>teki'ah</i> in one breath - the obligation is not fulfilled. One can learn to blow the shofar on Shabbat. One does not prevent women and children from blowing on Shabbat, nor on festive days."
