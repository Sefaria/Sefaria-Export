            "And what is the difference between a <i>zov</i> and an emission of seed (Lev. 19:20, \"שכבת זרע\")? <i>Zov</i> comes from \"dead flesh\" (i.e., a flaccid penis, see Niddah 35b:5, Steinsaltz tr.), and an emission of seed comes from \"live flesh\" (i.e., an erect penis). <i>Zov</i> is runny, and similar to the white of an unfertilized egg.  And an emission of seed is viscous, and is similar in appearance to the white of an egg that is not unfertilized. An emission of seed is reddish and the woman may attribute [a bloodstain on her clothes] to it (see Niddah 8:2).",
            "A <i>zav</i> attributes it to food and to any food. Rabbi Eliezer ben Pinchas says in the name of Rabbi Yehudah ben Beteirah, milk and cheese and beef, oil and aged wine, pounded beans and eggs, fish pickling liquid, are [all] customary for the flow of the <i>ziva</i> [to be attributed]. [With respect to] a [flow in a] baby, they attribute it to five things -- to food, to drink, to carrying, and to jumping in his sickness and in his mother['s sickness]. Rabbi Shimon ben Yehudah says in the name of Rabbi Shimon, just as they attribute [a <i>zov</i>] to a seminal emission during the past twenty-four hours, so too [do they attribute it] to a look and to a thought in the last twenty-four hours. But to food, and to drink, to carrying, and to jumping, they attribute [the <i>zov</i>] to all these things when they give him pain."
