            "These are the things that have no set amount: the peah, the bikkurim, the r'iyah, charity, and learning Torah. Peah has a minimum amount but does not have a maximum amount. [If] one makes his entire field peah, it is not peah.",
            "These are the things that are [constantly] subtracting from a person['s ultimate reward] in this world while the principal remains for him in the world to come: idolatry, sexual perversion, and murder; and slander is equal to all of them.",
            "A good deed has immediate and future benefit, as it is stated (Isaiah 3:10), \"Say ye of the righteous, that it shall be well with him, for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.\" A transgression has immediate damage but no future damage [for the transgressor], as it is stated (Isaiah 3:11), \"Woe unto the wicked! It shall be ill with him, for the work of his hands shall be done to him.\" How, then, am I to understand \"[The wicked] shall eat of the fruit of their own way\" (Proverbs 1:31)? Rather, when a transgression damages, it has immediate damage, and when it does not damage, it has no immediate damage.",
            "A good thought [Hashem] combines to action; a bad thought Hashem does not combine to action, as it is stated, \"If I had regarded iniquity in my heart [the Lord would not hear].\" How, then, am I to understand \"Behold I am bringing evil, fruit of your thoughts?\" Rather, a good thought that does good Hashem combines to action, and that which does not do good Hashem does not combine to action.",
            "[The field owner] gives a person Peah from the beginning of the field, from the middle, and from the end (Peah 1:3), but if he gives Peah either from the beginning, the middle, or the end, he has complied. Rabbi Shimon says, \"If he gave either from the beginning, the middle, or the end, behold, that is [sufficient to fulfill the obligation of] Peah, but he [also] needs to give from the end according to its measure. Rabbi Yehudah says, if [even] a single stalk is left, he can rely on it for purposes of Peah, and if not, then what he gives [the poor] only [has the status of] ownerless [produce]. Said Rabbi Yehudah, in what context does this apply [i.e., relying on a single stalk]? [It applies] at the time that he [already fulfilled his obligation and] gave Peah and he seeks to add to it (but see Peah 1:3).",
            "[If] he did not give [Peah] from the standing grain, he gives from the sheaves. [If] he did not give from the sheaves, he gives from the pile of grain. [If] he did not give from the stack of grain, he gives from the heap (=כרי, see B.M. 9:5), until he [makes it into a] stack (see Peah 1:6), and if he [makes it into a] stack, he tithes it [first] and then gives it [to the poor]",
            "Said Rabbi Shimon, because of four things the Torah said not to give a person Peah except at the end of his field: [First,] due to theft by the poor; and [second,] due to waste by the poor; and [third,] for appearance's sake; [and fourth,] due to the deceivers. Due to theft by the poor -- how so? That they will not see a time that there isn't someone there [guarding the field], and he [?] will say to the poor person, \"Come and take Peah.\" Due to waste by the poor -- how so? That there will not be poor people and sit around and watch the whole day and say, \"Now give [us] Peah!\" whereas when Peah is given at the end, he goes [about his business] and does his work, [and then] he comes and takes it at the end. For appearance's sake -- how so? They will be there and pass through and say that they saw so-and-so that harvested the field, and did not give from it Peah, that behold the Torah said (Lev. 19:9), \"you are not to finish [to the] edge of your field in harvesting.\" Due to deceivers -- how so? That they will not say, \"We already gave [Peah].\" Or another version, that [the homeowner] will not leave the good and give the bad.",
            "[With respect to] vegetables, even though they are gathered as one, they are not brought in for storage [and therefore are not liable in Peah, see Peah 1:4]. [With respect to] figs, even though they are brought in for storage, they are not gathered as one [and therefore are also not liable in Peah].",
            "Rabbi Yosei son of [Rabbi] Yehuda says, moist [i.e., fresh] dates are exempt from Peah, because the first one does not wait for the last ones (see <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.3.1.10\" href=\"Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.3.1.10\">Y. Peah III.1.10</a>). Rabbi Eliezer son of [Rabbi] Tzadok says, the jujube is liable in Peah. Others say, even white figs (<i>benot shevach</i>, see Ber. 40b:22).",
            "The following divide a field for Peah (see Peah 2:1, following Kulp tr.): a stream, a pool, a private road, a public road, a public path, a private path in constant use in summer and the rainy season, fallow land, a plowed field, and a different seed, and the harvest [specifically done] for animal fodder, and three furrows of newly broken land (see Kilayim 2:6), and a water channel that makes harvesting on one side impossible (see Peah 2:2). Rabbi Yehudah says, if he [is able to] stand in the middle and harvest on both sides, it divides [a field for Peah], but if not, then it does not divide.  [If] it was devoured by chagav (a species of locust), devoured by govei (another species of locust), undermined by ants, or a storm or animals broke it, everyone agrees that if he plowed [the field after it was ruined, see <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.2.1.10\" href=\"Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.2.1.10\">Y. Peah II.1.10</a>, Guggenheimer tr.], it (i.e., the newly plowed field separates), and if not, it does not separate.",

            "[With respect to] steps whose height is ten Tephachim (=handbreadths), we give Peah from each and every one [individually], but if the beginnings of the rows were intermixed with one another, we give Peah from one [step on behalf of] everything.",
            "He who takes out the green onions for sale and leaves the others to ripen for storage (=המארג, see Jastrow) is liable at the beginning [of his harvest] and is liable at the end [of his harvest]. [If] he had four or five grapevines, and he harvests them and brings them [for storage] inside his house, he is exempt from Peret (Peah 7:3), from the forgotten sheaf, and from Peah, but he is liable in Olelet (Peah 7:4). And if [any vines] remain [to be harvested], he gives from the remainder [only] on behalf of that remainder itself [but not on what he previously brought inside his house]. One who thins out [his produce, see Peah 3:3], gives from what remains [on behalf of] that remainder itself [but not on the thinned-out portion].  Said Rabbi Yehudah, in what context does this apply? With regards to one who thins out produce in the marketplace, but one who thins out produce inside his house, he gives from the remainder on behalf of everything [including the thinned-out portion].",
            "If he was plucking off [his produce one at a time] and bringing it inside his house, even [if he plucked] his entire field, he is exempt from gleanings, the forgotten sheaf, and Peah, but he is liable for tithes.",
            "[With respect to] one who is about to die who assigns his property in writing to his sons, and leaves land to his wife, however small, she has lost her ketubah (see Peah 3:7, following Kulp tr.). Said Rabbi Yosei, in what context does this apply? When she accepted [this assignment of land] upon herself for the purpose of her ketubah, but if she did not accept [this assignment of land] upon herself for the purpose of her ketubah, what [her husband] gave, he gave (i.e., the gift is valid), and [after her husband's death] she may collect on her ketubah the remainder of her inheritance.",
            "[With respect to] one who assigns in writing his possessions to his slave, [the slave] thereby goes free (Peah 3:8, following Kulp tr.). [But if] he reserved for himself any land, however small, he does not go free.  Rabbi Shimon says, one who says, \"I give all of my possessions to such-and-such slave, except for one-thousandth part of them,\" [it is as though] he did not say anything. [But if he said, \"I give all of my possessions to such-and-such slave,] except for [my possessions in] such-and-such city or such-and-such field, even though he owns nothing but that field or [possessions] in that city, the slave has acquired these as his inheritance, and has acquired himself and become a free man.

            "A homeowner who gave Peah to the poor, and one poor person came and took [the Peah] from behind them, behold, he has acquired it [i.e., it is his to keep]. Two poor people were fighting with each other over a [single] sheaf [עומר not עמוד] and then one poor person came and took [the sheaf] from behind them, behold, he has acquired it. For a poor person does not acquire anything [when it comes to] gleanings, forgotten [sheaves], or Peah, or found coins, until it comes into his hand.",

But the Sages say, a [declaration of abandonment] under duress is not a [valid] abandonment (אין הפקר, see GR\"A), for we are not responsible for [the actions of] tricksters.",

            "A Gentile (alt., \"convert,\" per Erfurt manuscript) who died and the Jews plundered his property [as he left no heirs (see Bava Batra 142a:3, following Steinsaltz)], it is presumed [that anything still] attached to the ground is liable in everything [i.e., peah, gleanings, forgotten sheaves, and tithes], and that all that is unattached from the ground is exempt from everything. The presumption is that standing grain is exempt from the [laws of] gleanings, from forgotten sheaves, and from peah, and liable in tithes (but see Hagahot HaGR\"A, switching \"exempt\" and \"liable\" here).",

At a time that the Gentile protests [his produce being deemed ownerless, thus rendering it liable for tithes (see Kulp at Peah 4:9)], but if the Gentile does not protest [and consents to his property being deemed ownerless], the ownerless property of a Gentile is [indeed] ownerless, and exempt from tithes.",

[There are] three [gifts for the poor] from field-produce: Gleanings (Lev. 19:9), forgotten sheaves, and peah. [There are] two [gifts for the poor] from fruit trees: forgotten sheaves and peah. [And as to] all of these, they should not [be given as] a favor, and [others] can even take [gifts for the poor given as a favor] from a Jewish poor person from his hand (i.e., since it does not lawfully belong to him in the first place). And [as to] the remainder of the priestly gifts, such as the shankbone and the jawbone and the rough-stomach (see Deut. 18:3), these may be [given as] a favor.

If there were [in the field] poor people who are not fitting [to be allowed] to glean [the gifts to the poor, then] if the owner of the field can prevent them [from gleaning], he is allowed to do so, but if [he is] not [able to prevent them from gleaning, then] he should leave them alone [and let them glean anyway] because of peaceful relations [between people].",

Rebbi Shimon Ben Yehuda says in the name of Rebbi Shimon, “Even if other people were passing by on the road [next to the field] and they saw the sheaf that they (i.e. workers) have forgotten, it is not [considered to be] Shikcha until it gets forgotten by all people, [including the passersby.]”",
            "Rebbi Yehuda says, “A person who made his whole field into sheaves [in order to later] stook them [into stooks, which in turn will be taken to the final stack] is [considered to be] like someone who bundles [sheaves] in [order to put them in a] stack [of sheaves, which makes the sheaves inside the stooks eligible to become Shikcha (forgotten sheaves),] and [then] rounded it (i.e. the stack) out [as if he has completed the stack] and [then brought more sheaves and] pressed [them] into the stack [after the stack seemed to be already finished, which is still considered to be the final act of bundling, which makes these sheaves eligible to become Shikcha].” Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel agree that if [a person] proclaimed [his produce to be] ownerless [only] to people, but not to animals, [or only] to Jews, but not to Non-Jews, [it is still considered to be] ownerless [and anyone can come and take it].",
            "Rebbi Ilai said, “I asked Rebbi Yehoshua, ‘Regarding which sheaves Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel argue [whether they are considered to be Shikcha (forgotten sheaves) or not]?’ He said to me, ‘[I swear] by this Torah [that they argue]’ regarding a sheaf [that is left in the field] next to a hedge, or [next to] a stack, [or next to] cattle [used for plowing], or [next to plowing] tools, and it was forgotten [there by the farmer].’ And when I came and asked Rebbi Eliezer, he said to me, ‘They agree by all of these [cases that Rebbi Yehoshua mentioned] that it is not [considered to be] Shikcha.

Regarding a sheaf that [the farmer] took [with him] to bring to the city and put it on the side of a stone fence or on the side of a hedge [in order to take a break], and forgot it [there], that Bet Shammai say that it is not [considered to be] Shikcha, because he [already] acquired it [for himself], and Bet Hillel say [that it is considered to be] Shikcha.’ And when I came and proclaimed [these] words [of Rebbi Eliezer] in front of Rebbi Elazar Ben Azaryah he said to me, ‘[I swear] by the Torah, these are the words that were spoken to Moshe on Sinai.’”",

Two sheaves separated from one another are [considered to be] Shikcha (forgotten sheaves), [but] three [sheaves] are not [considered to be] Shikcha. Two grapevines separated from one another (i.e. from separate tree trunks) are [considered to be] Shikcha (forgotten sheaves), [but] three [grapevines] are not [considered to be] Shikcha. Two [grape] berries [lying next to each other on the ground] are [considered to be] Peret (individual fallen grapes), [but] three [grape berries lying next to each other on the ground] are not [considered to be] Peret. Two stalks [of grain] separated from one another in the usual fashion are [considered to be] Leket (fallen stalks), [but] three [stalks of grain] are not [considered to be] Leket.

However, any [produce] where the property of the poor person (i.e. some kind of gift to the poor) cannot come in the middle [of two sets of produce, one standing and one detached, both of which are one Seah in volume], for example fruits of a tree, does combine [to form two Seahs and therefore both parts are not considered to be Shikcha].’”",

At the time when [the standing crops] were not taken in the middle (i.e. between the time when the sheaf was forgotten and remembered by the farmer), but if [the standing crops] were taken in the middle (i.e. prior to the farmer remembering that he forgot that sheaf) then it does not disqualify [that sheaf from being considered Shikcha, and the farmer cannot go back and take it for himself]. “The standing crops of his (i.e. the farmer’s) friend [that were not forgotten] disqualify his (i.e. the farmer’s) [own standing crops that were forgotten from being considered Shikcha], [the standing crops] of wheat [that were not forgotten disqualify the standing crops] of barley [that were forgotten from being considered Shikcha], [the standing crops] of a non-Jew [that were not forgotten disqualify the standing crops] of a Jew [that were forgotten from being considered Shikcha].” These are the words of Rebbi Meir. But the Chachamim (Sages) say, “[Standing crops that were not forgotten] do not disqualify [other standing crops that were forgotten], unless they were his (i.e. the farmer’s and not someone else’s) [own] and [they were] of the same kind [of crops].” Rabban Shimon Ben Gamliel says, “Just like standing crops [that were not forgotten] disqualify a sheaf [that was forgotten from being considered Shikcha], so too the sheaf [that was not forgotten] disqualifies standing crops [that were forgotten from being considered Shikcha]. And [the reason for this law] is a Kal Vechomer (derivation from minor to major) [which goes as follows]. Since standing crops by which the power of the poor person is weak [have the capability to] disqualify a sheaf [from being considered Shikcha], then for sure a sheaf by which the power of the poor person is strong should [have the capability to] disqualify standing crops.” They (i.e. the Chachamim) said [back] to him (i.e. Rabban Shimon Ben Gamliel), “Rebbi! [That is not correct, because the reverse argument can be made as well, as follows.] Just like standing crops can disqualify a sheaf by which the power of the poor person is strong [from being considered Shikcha], so too the sheaf should disqualify the standing crops by which the power of the poor person is [also] strong [for a different reason as explained in the next Tosefta] [from being considered Shikcha].”",
            "The power of the poor person is stronger with regards to standing crops than with regards to a sheaf. And [yet at the same time the power of the poor person] is stronger with regards to a sheaf than with regards to standing crops. Because [all three gifts to the poor:] Leket (fallen stalks), Shikcha (forgotten sheaves) and Peah (corners of the field) apply to standing crops, but it is not so with regards to a sheaf, [to which only Shikcha and Peah apply, but Leket does not.] And [yet the opposite is true as well since] the sheaf that is two Seahs [in size by volume] and has been forgotten, is not considered to be Shikcha, unless it is smaller than two Seahs, [whereas standing crops are not considered Shikcha even if they are smaller than two Seahs in size, as long as they have the potential of being two Seahs in size in a different year due to better growth.]",
            "[A person] who is cutting gavels [of grain, with intention] to bundle them into sheaves later [and not right away], and also [a person who is piling up] heaps of garlic [with intention to make from the heaps] bundles of garlic, or [spread out] onions, [later and not right away, if any of these gavels of grain or heaps of garlic, or spread out onions, have been forgotten in the field, the law of] Shikcha (forgotten sheaves) does not apply to them, [and therefore they still belong to the owner, who can go back and retrieve them.] [A person] who is binding sheaves, because of [an approaching] fire or because of an irrigation canal [that broke through and is about to flood the field, if any of these sheaves have been forgotten in the field the law of] Shikcha does not apply to them, [and therefore they still belong to the owner, who can go back and retrieve them,] because he (i.e. the farmer) will check [the field for any forgotten sheaves, since he is not harvesting them, but rather moving them out of the way of the fire or flooding water.] It happened with a certain pious person that he forgot a sheaf in his field [during harvest,] and he said to his son, “Go [to the Temple in Jerusalem] and sacrifice in my name a bull for Korban Olah (burnt-offering) and a bull for Korban Shlamim (peace-offering).” He (i.e. his son) said [back] to him (i.e. the father), “Father! What have you seen in this commandment [of Shikcha that caused you] to rejoice [about it] more than all [other] commandments that are mentioned in the Torah?” He (i.e. the father) said [back] to him (i.e. the son), “All [other] commandments [that are mentioned] in the Torah have been given to us by God [to be executed] consciously (i.e. on purpose with intent). [But] this [commandment of Shikcha was given to us by God to be executed] unconsciously (i.e. accidentally due to forgetfulness), because if we would have done it willingly (i.e. left the sheaf in the field on purpose for the poor to take) in front of God, this commandment would not be counted for us [as a fulfilled commandment of Shikcha, but rather as a random act of kindness.]” He (i.e. the son) said [back] to him (i.e. the father), “It says [in the Torah], ‘When you will harvest your harvest in your field and you will forget a sheaf in the field, do not go back to take it. It shall be [left there] for the Non-Jewish resident, for the orphan, and for the widow, in order that Hashem, your God, will bless you with all the deeds of your hand.’ (Devarim 24:19) The verse has granted him (i.e. the farmer who left the sheaf in the field) a blessing. [But why did the verse need to say explicitly that the farmer will get a blessing?] Is not it a Kal Vechomer (derivation from minor to major) [which can be concluded by us logically without the need of an explicit verse]? Just like someone who did not intend to do something good, but he [ended up] doing something good [anyway], the verse considers him as if he has done something good, so for sure someone who intended to do something good, and [ended up] doing something good [that he meant to do] how much more so [should get a blessing]?” Similarly, [it says in the Torah:] “If a soul from the common people sins by accident by doing one of the negative commandments of Hashem, and becomes guilty of it. When his sin which he sinned will become known to him … (the verses go on to describe the sacrifice that the sinner should bring) … and the priest will atone for him, and he will be forgiven.” (Vayikra 4:27-31) And it is a Kal Vechomer [which can be concluded by us logically]! Just like someone who did not intend to sin, but sinned [anyway], we consider him as if he sinned. So someone who intended to sin and [then] sinned, how much more so [should be considered as if he sinned. And therefore will for sure get punished.]",
