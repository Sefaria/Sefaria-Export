It shall be ill with him, for the work of his hands shall be done to him.\" How, then, am I to understand \"[The wicked] shall eat of the fruit of their own way\" (Proverbs 1:31)?

Due to theft by the poor -- how so? That they will not see a time that there isn't someone there [guarding the field], and he [?] will say to the poor person, \"Come and take Peah.\" Due to waste by the poor -- how so? That there will not be poor people and sit around and watch the whole day and say, \"Now give [us] Peah!\" whereas when Peah is given at the end, he goes [about his business] and does his work, [and then] he comes and takes it at the end. For appearance's sake -- how so? They will be there and pass through and say that they saw so-and-so that harvested the field, and did not give from it Peah, that behold the Torah said (Lev. 19:9), \"you are not to finish [to the] edge of your field in harvesting.\" Due to deceivers -- how so?

Rabbi Shimon says, one who says, \"I give all of my possessions to such-and-such slave, except for one-thousandth part of them,\" [it is as though] he did not say anything. [But if he said, \"I give all of my possessions to such-and-such slave,] except for [my possessions in] such-and-such city or such-and-such field, even though he owns nothing but that field or [possessions] in that city, the slave has acquired these as his inheritance, and has acquired himself and become a free man.

Any [cluster] that lacks a \"shoulder\" or a \"pendant.\" If it has a shoulder but not a pendant, or has a pendant but lacks a shoulder, behold, it belongs to the property owner, and if not, behold, it belongs to the poor people. <i>What is a \"shoulder\"?</i> Growths joined to each other at the stem, each one next to the other (and see <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Bartenura_on_Mishnah_Peah.7.4\" href=\"Bartenura_on_Mishnah_Peah.7.4\">Bartenura</a> to Peah 7:4). <i>What is a \"pendant\"?</i>Grapes joined to the stem that drop down (and see <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Bartenura_on_Mishnah_Peah.7.4\" href=\"Bartenura_on_Mishnah_Peah.7.4\">ibid.</a>).",

And in Syria, and until the places that the messengers of the new month would arrive (Rosh Hashanah 1:3), [a putative Kohen's status is established by] the Lifting of the Hands, but not by the distribution  [of Terumah] on the threshing floors.

[In regards to holy things] in the Temple, [the Kohen himself] is responsible for them and must take care of them, and take them to the Chosen House (i.e., the Temple).
