This is the general rule: Said Rabbi Yosei, whatever increases in measure [as a result of being mixed with unconsecrated produce], [if] the improvement [in value] can be recognized, the improvement [is calculated] according to the proportion, [and] whatever does not increase in measure, [if] the improvement [in value] can be recognized, the [entire] improvement [goes] to second tithe (see Maaser Sheni 2.1)."
