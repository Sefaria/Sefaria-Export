            "We do not bring Bikkurim (first fruits) before Shavuot, and if they are [nonetheless] brought, we must wait until Shavuot arrives and [only then] recite the declaration [beginning with \"My father was a wandering Aramean...\" (Deut. 26:5-10)].",
            "One who purchases a single tree out of many [in close proximity], behold, he brings [its fruits] but does not recite the declaration because he did not purchase the land [but only the tree], the words of Rabbi Meir. And the Sages say, he neither brings it nor recites the declaration.",
            "Rabbi Yehuda says, [among] all the converts, everyone brings [first fruits] but they do not recite the declaration. [However,] the Kenites, the descendants of the father-in-law of Moses (Judges 1:16), bring [first fruits] and recite the declaration, as it is said (Num. 10:32), \"[Moses said to Hovav, son of R'uel the Midyanite, Moses's father-in-law] ... It will be that if you go with us ... [from the goodness that God does to us, we will do good unto you].\"",
            "Rabbi Yosei says, Rabbi Meir would say that Kohanim bring but do not recite because they were not given a portion of the land, but I say, just as the Levites were given [their own cities], so too the Kohanim were given [priestly gifts] which obtain both with much and with little<sup>*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">see Sifrei Devarim 165:8, Silverstein tr.</i>.",
            "One who separated his first fruits and [then] sold his field brings but does not recite. And the second one (i.e., the purchaser), what does he have to bring? He may not bring [first fruits] from the same species, [but] from a different species he brings and he recites. Rabbi Yehuda says, even from the same species, he brings and recites.",
            "Behold, he separated his first fruits and he recited over them, and then he went back and purchased a different field, and [that field] yielded him five species of first fruits: Even if among them were other species (i.e., that he had not brought the first time)<sup>*</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>אפילו ממין אחר</b> (following the GR\"A's emendation); the printed text reads, \"even if among them were <i>the same species</i>...\"</i>, he brings but does not recite, as a person may not recite [the first-fruit declaration] twice in the same year.",
            "Rabbi Yehuda says, until [he brings them] to the Be'er HaGolah (per Lieberman, an area on the perimeter of the Temple Courtyard), he remains obligated in the responsibility [of bringing first fruits]. From [the point that he brings the fruit to] the Be'er HaGolah, he is no longer obligated in the responsibility. Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon, as for one who must replace [the first fruits if they were robbed or rotted (see Bikkurim 1:8)], he is not liable [to pay an extra] fifth in addition to [the replacement].",
            "Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, we do not bring first fruits from dates, except for the dates that [grow] in Jericho, and we do not recite [the declaration] except over the dry ones. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says, we bring valley pomegranates<sup>*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., as opposed to valley figs (see notes to Y. Bikkurim I.3.7)</i> and recite [the declaration over them].",
            "There is a stringency with Terumah (the priestly portion of produce) that there is not with second tithe (which is exchanged for money and brought to Jerusalem) or first fruits, and [a stringency] with second tithe that there is not with Terumah. [With respect to the stringency of Terumah], we may not take [Terumah] except out of a mass [of produce] in close proximity (המוקף), nor may we take it except from [produce that is in] a finished state, nor may we take it except from the pure on behalf of the impure, or the <i>medumma</i> (a forbidden mixture of Terumah and <i>chullin</i>), and we are liable on it for an extra fifth, and it applies to all [species of] produce, which is not the case with first fruits. And it applies to all the years [of the seven-year agricultural cycle other than the seventh year], all of which is not the case with second tithe [which only applies to the first, second, fourth, and fifth years].",
            "The stringency with second tithe is that [with respect to wine from] second tithe, he \"acquires the jugs\" (see Mishneh Torah), and money [exchanged for it] is forbidden, and [with respect to] mixtures, a doubt as to a mixture [potentially involving second tithe forbids it] in any amount, [and] it is forbidden to a mourner, and [its violation] requires [the payment of] a fifth and requires a confession, and it is not permitted to eat except when it is redeemed, and it may not light it on fire, all of which is not the case with Terumah.",
            "There is a stringency with Terumah and second tithe that there is not with first fruits: That Terumah and second tithe apply to [the lands of] Ammon and Moab, which is not the case with first fruits. There is a stringency with second tithe and first fruits that there is not with Terumah: That second tithe and first fruits require one to come to the \"place\" (i.e., the Temple, the \"place\" that God has chosen to have his name dwell (see Deut. 14:23 (second tithe), Deut. 26:2 (first fruits)), and they require a confession, and they are forbidden to a mourner -- but Rabbi Shimon permits them [to a mourner]. And they are liable in [the laws of] <i>bi'ur</i><sup>*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., the requirement that one uproot produce growing during the sabbatical year, and declare it ownerless (see Sheviit 7:1, 9:4)</i>. Rabbi Shimon says, first fruits are exempt from <i>bi'ur</i> (Bikkurim 2:2). Rabbi Yosei says, since second tithe requires confession and first fruits require confession, [you must say that] since second tithe requires removal, so too first fruits must require removal as well. Rabbi Shimon said to him, since with second tithe, in which the requirement of <i>bi'ur</i> applies [both to seventh-year produce] as well as to money [exchanged for such produce], you must say that with respect to first fruits, as to which the money exchanged for them does not require <i>bi'ur</i>, [the first fruits themselves do not require removal during the sabbatical year].",
            "And so too Rabbi Shimon would say, [the Sages] did not state that produce that grows from [the seeds of] first fruits must be eaten in Jerusalem. \"Tithes\" -- about which \"tithes\" did they speak [when the Sages ruled that aftergrowths must be treated as tithes (see Ter. 9:6)]? [They ruled that aftergrowths are treated as tithes only] with regards to anything whose seed disintegrates [after planting], with regards to [produce] that is taken in and out of Jerusalem, with regards to [produce] that does not have the value of a <i>perutah</i>, and with regards to [produce] that is not [subject to the laws of] redemption. Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon, one is not liable [to bring] first fruits that are attached to the ground."

            "A <i>k'vi</i> (see Bikkurim 2:8) -- how is it like a wild animal? Its blood requires covering like a wild animal. Rabbi Eliezer says, they are liable to bring a variable guilt-offering for [partaking in] their [forbidden] fats. How is it like both a wild animal and a domesticated animal? One who flays<sup>*</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>המפשיט</b> not  <b>מפסיד</b>, see GR\"A</i> it, [the laws regarding whether its hide is] connected [to its flesh is] like wild animals and domesticated animals (see Tos. Chullin 8:6). And [the laws of] the sciatic nerve apply to it, like they do to wild animals and domesticated animals. If he said, \"Behold, I will become a nazirite if [the <i>k'vi</i>] is [neither] a wild animal or a domesticated animal,\" behold, he has become a nazirite. Rabbi Yosei says, a <i>k'vi</i> is a unique creation unto itself, and the Sages were unable to render a decision about it, if it it is a wild animal or a domesticated animal.",
            "An <i>androgynous</i> (i.e., a hermaphrodite) is in some ways like a man and in some ways like a woman. And in some ways he<sup>*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Note: The Tosefta uses the masculine gender as a default in reference to an <i>androgynous</i>.</i> is like both a man and a woman, and in some ways he is like neither a man nor a woman.",
            "The ways in which he is like men: He imparts impurity with white discharge like men. He marries but is not married (נישא not נושא), like men. And he may not seclude himself with women, like men. And he is not provided sustenance (ניזון not נתזן) along with [a person's] daughters, like men. And he does not [permit himself to] become impure by the dead, like men (i.e., male priests). He is subject to transgressing the prohibition against \"rounding off [the corners of the head]\" (Lev. 19:27) and [if he is a priest] he is subject to transgressing the prohibition against \"defiling oneself with the dead\" (Lev. 21:1), like men, and he is liable for performing all the commandments in the Torah, like men.",
            "The ways in which he is like women: He imparts impurity with red discharge, like women. And he may not be secluded with men, like women. And he does not create a levirate bond with his deceased brother's wife, like women. And he does not share in a portion of the most holy offerings, like women. And he is disqualified in all testimony that is [delineated] in the Torah, like women. And if he engaged in forbidden sexual relations, he is disqualified from [the priestly gifts bestowed upon members of] the priesthood, like women.",
            "Ways that he is like both men and women: One who strikes him is liable, as with men and women. One who willfully kills him is executed, and one who unintentionally kills him is exiled to the cities of refuge. [After he is born,] his mother observes the period of blood-purity, as with men and women (see Niddah 28a:15), and she brings a sacrifice, as with men and women. And he possesses all the rights of inheritance, as with men and women. And he partakes of a portion of the priestly gifts of the countryside (e.g., the shankbone, maw, and jaw, Deut. 18:3) like men and women, and if someone said \"Behold, I will become a nazirite if this one is either a man or a woman,\" behold he has become a nazirite.",
            "Ways in which he is neither like a man nor a woman: He is not liable on his impure [discharge], and he does not burn his impure [Terumah], and he does not have a prescribed value, which is neither like men nor like women, and he is not sold as a Hebrew slave, which is neither like men nor like women. If someone said, \"Behold, I will become a nazirite if this one is neither a man nor a woman,\" behold, he has become a nazirite. Rabbi Yosei says, an <i>androgynous</i> is a unique creation unto himself and the Sages were unable to render a decision about him, whether he is a man or woman, but this is not so with a <i>tumtum</i>, as to whom there is only a doubt as to whether he is a man or a woman.",
            "How do we separate the first fruits? A person goes down to his field and sees a fig that was a first fruit, or a cluster of grapes that was a first fruit, he ties them with a rope and says, \"Behold, these are first fruits!\" Rabbi Shimon says, he returns and designates them as first fruits after he has detached them from the ground.",
            "[It is] a mitzvah to bring [the first fruits] in seven vessels (i.e., corresponding to the seven species, see Deut. 8:7-8), but if he brought them in [only] one vessel, he fulfilled his obligation. <i>How so?</i> He brings barley and places it on the bottom, and then something else on top of it; and then the next-to-the bottom is wheat, and then something else on top of that; and next he puts olives on top of them, and then figs on top of all of them, and surrounds them with grape clusters from the outside.  § They would not ascend [to Jerusalem] alone, but rather town by town (פלכים פלכים). They would not walk the entire day, but rather two thirds of the day. A cantor from the synagogue would go up with them and they would sleep in the streets of the city.  They would not enter anyone's house due to [the possibility of contracting] tent-impurity, which requires a burnt offering an a peace offering. They would not occupy themselves [with distractions] during the journey [to Jerusalem] in the way that they would occupy themselves on the return journey. § The times of the wood offering of the Priests and the people are nine (Taanit 4:5), and they require staying overnight, [but the inhabitants of the city] would not occupy themselves with them (i.e., those involved in the wood offerings) the way they would occupy themselves with those bringing the first fruits. § During the entire journey, one had the right to give [the baskets containing the first fruits] to his slave or to his relative [to carry on his behalf], until he arrived at the Temple Mount. Once they arrived at the Temple Mount, even King [Herod] Agrippa would hoist the basket [of first fruits] onto his shoulders and proceeded until he arrived at the Temple Courtyard. When he arrived at the Temple Courtyard, the Levites sang the psalm, \"I extol you, O Lord, for You have lifted me up, and not let my enemies rejoice over me\" (Ps. 30:1, JPS tr.). [At that point,] the birds that were tied to the baskets were offered as burnt-offerings, and whatever was in their hands they gave to the Priests.",
            "The additions to the first fruits are of the same kind. But the ornamentations may be of a different kind. The additions to the first fruits are eaten in a state of purity and one is exempt from a confession, and needless to say from [any presumption that the fruits may be] <i>demai</i> (i.e., uncertainly tithed). The ornamentation of the first fruits from a different type [should be made] from something that one will not be deemed liable for as <i>demai</i>, and needless to say, as <i>vadai</i> (certainly untithed produce). [For] the ornamentation of the first fruits from the same type, [one uses] something for which one will not be deemed liable for first fruits, nor [produce] from Ammon or Moab, [and indeed], even something that one may be liable for in first fruits should not derive from [those places].",
            "One who sells a Torah scroll will never see a sign of blessing (i.e., he will not benefit financially). One who writes scrolls for tefillin and mezuzot -- they and their merchants, and the merchants' merchants (i.e., the wholesalers), and all that occupy themselves not for the sake of Heaven, they will never see a sign of blessing. If they occupy themselves for the sake of Heaven, behold, they will receive every blessing. Merchants [who sell produce] in the sabbatical year, and those who grow small livestock, and those who chop down good trees, they will never see the sign of blessing of the Most High. [But] if they occupied themselves for the sake of Heaven, behold, they will receive every blessing."
