Anethum and coriander that one planted for the sake of their vegetable, even though they took root before Rosh Hashanah and they were harvested after Rosh Hashanah, one takes tithes from them and the time of their harvest is their time for tithes, and one may tithe their seed on behalf of their vegetable, and their vegetable on behalf of [other parts of] their vegetable.

But if he had a lot of small livestock, even a Beit Kor (a field that is 1/16 the size of a Beit Seah), even a field the size of two kors, it is permitted [to perform this procedure].
