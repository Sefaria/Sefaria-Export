            "From when do we read Shema in the evenings? “From the time when people come [home] to eat their bread on Shabbat (Sabbath) nights,” [these are] the words of Rebbi Meir. And the Chachamim (Sages) say from the time when the Kohanim (priests) are able to eat their Terumah (heave offering). A sign for this is the coming out of the stars. And even though there is no explicit proof for this matter, there is an indirect reference: “… and half of them were holding spears from the morning twilight until the coming out of the stars.” (Nehemiah 4:15)",
            "Rebbi Shimon says, “Sometimes a person may read it (i.e. The Shema) two times in one night, once before dawn and once after dawn. [And if that happens] it comes out that he fulfills his obligation for the day [reading] and for the night [reading].”...",
            "Rebbi says, “There are four watches in a night. [There is a unit of time called] time period (Onah) which is 1/24th of an hour. And [there is another unit of time called] the time (Et) which is 1/24th of the time period (Onah). And [there is a third unit of time called] the moment (Regah) which is 1/24th of the time (Et).” Rebbi Natan says, “There are three watches in a night, as it is said ‘… the beginning of the middle watch.’ (Judges 7:19) There is no [such thing as a] middle, but only when there is something before it and after it.”",
            "From when do we read the Shema in the morning? Acherim (Others) say, “[from the time] when his friend will be four amot away from him and he recognizes him.” The mitzvah [to say it] is with sunrise in order to connect redemption (Geulah) to prayer (Tefillah), and it will come out that he will pray during the day. Rebbi Yehudah said, “One time I was walking behind Rebbi Akiva and Rebbi Elazar Ben Azaryah and the time came to read the Shema. I supposed they gave up on reading the Shema [right away] because they were busy with the needs of the community. I read [the Shema] and [then] learned [some Torah] and after that they began [reading the Shema], and the sun could already be seen above the mountain tops.”",
            "The grooms and all [others] who are involved in [other] Mitzvot (commandments) are exempt from reading [the] Shema as it is said, “… when you sit in your house”, (Deuteronomy 6:7) [meaning] except for those who are involved in mitzvot, “and when you walk on the way”, (Deuteronomy 6:7) [meaning] except for the grooms.",
            "It happened with Rebbi Yishmael and Rebbi Elazar Ben Azaryah that they were resting in the same place and Rebbi Yishmael was laying down and Rebbi Elazar Ben Azaryah was [standing up] straight. It came time to say Shema. Rebbi Yishmael stood up straight and Rebbi Elazar laid down. Said to him Rebbi Yishmael: “What is this Elazar?” He said [back] to him: “Yishmael, my brother! They say to a person, ‘Why is your beard all grown [so nice]?’ He said [back to them], ‘[it should be sent] against the destroyers’ (i.e. cut off by the scissors). [So too with us] I (Rebbi Elazar Ben Azaryah) who was straight, laid down, you that was laying down, stood up straight?” [So Rebbi Yishmael] said to him: “You laid down to fulfill the words of Bet Shamai, I stood up straight to fulfill the words of Bet Hillel. A different explanation, that the students should not see [that you did like Bet Shamai] and make your words [a] permanent [law].",
            "Why did they say one short [Beracha (blessing)]? In the place where they said to be long, one is not allowed to be short, [and in the place where they said] to be short, one is not allowed to be long. [In the place where they said] to seal off [the Beracha], one is not allowed not to seal off, [in the place where they said] not to seal off [the Beracha], one is not allowed to seal off. [In the place where they said] to begin [the Beracha] with [the word] Baruch (Blessed), one is not allowed not to begin with Baruch, [in the place where they said] not to begin [the Beracha] with Baruch, one is not allowed to begin with Baruch. [In the place where they said] to bend down, one is not allowed not to bend down , [and in the place where they said] not to bend down, one is not allowed to bend down.",
            "These are the Berachot (blessings) which are [coined to be] short: One who blesses on fruit, and on mitzvot, the Beracha (blessing) of Zimun, and the last Beracha of Shema. These are the Berachot which are [coined to be] long: the Beracha of Fast Days, and the Beracha of Rosh Hashana, and the Berachot of Yom Kippur. From [the way] a person [says] his Berachot it is recognizable if he a fool or if he is a sage.",
            "These are the Berachot (blessings) which do not seal off with [the phrase] Baruch [Ata Hashem] (Blessed are You Hashem): One that blesses on the fruit, and on the mitzvot, Birkat Hazimun, and the last Beracha in Birkat Hamazon. Rebbi Yossi Hagelili used to seal off the last Beracha in Birkat Hamazon and [therefore] make it long.",
            "These are the Berachot (blessings) which begin with [the phrase] Baruch [Ata Hashem] (Blessed are You Hashem). All Berachot begin with [the phrase] Baruch [Ata Hashem] except for the Beracha (blessing) which is adjacent to Shema and a Beracha which is adjacent to another Beracha, in [both of] which [cases] we do not begin with [the phrase] Baruch [Ata Hashem].",
            "In these Berachot (blessings) we bow down: the first Beracha (blessing) [of Shemoneh Esreh], in the beginning and at the end, and in [the paragraph of] Modim [in Shemoneh Esreh], in the beginning and at the end. And [as for] one who bows down in every [single] Beracha [of Shemoneh Esreh], we teach him that he should not bow down [in them]. We do not say [the Beracha] together with the one that says the Beracha [for you]. Rebbi Yehudah would say together with the one that made the Beracha, Kadosh Kadosh Kadosh Hashem Tzevaot Melo Kol Haaretz Kevodo (Isaiah 6:3) (Holy, Holy, Holy, Hashem Tzevaot, the earth is full with His glory) and Baruch Kevod Hashem Mimkomo (Ezekiel 3:12) (Blessed be the glory of Hashem from His place). All of these Rebbi Yehudah would say together with the one that made the Beracha.",
            "We mention the Exodus from Egypt at night. Said Rebbi Elazar Ben Azaryah, “Here I am like a seventy year old man and I have not merited to hear that one should mention Exodus from Egypt at night, until the exegesis (Derasha) of Ben Zoma.” “In order that you should remember the day that you left Egypt, all the days of your life.\" (Deuteronomy 16:3), the days of your life [means] days, all the days of your life [means] nights.” These are the words of Ben Zoma. And the Chachamim (Sages) say, “Days of your life [means] this world, all the days of your life [means] the days of the Mashiach (Messiah).” Ben Zoma said to the Chachamim, “And are we going to mention the Exodus from Egypt during the days of the Mashiach? Does not it say: “Therefore behold, the days are coming, the word of Hashem, and they will not say anymore, as lives Hashem, who has brought the Children of Israel from the land of Egypt. But rather, [they will say], as lives Hashem who has brought and who will bring the seed of the House of Israel from the Northern land and from all the lands to which I have pushed them there, and they will dwell in their land?” (Jeremiah 23:7-8) They said to him, “It does not [mean] that the Exodus from Egypt will be uprooted from them, but rather that Egypt will be added to the [other] kingdoms. [Other] kingdoms will be the main [subject], and Egypt will be a secondary [subject]. Similarly [it says], your name will not be called anymore, Yakov, but rather Yisrael will be your name. (Genesis, 35:10) [It does] not [mean] that [the name] Yakov was completely uprooted from him, but rather [the name] Yakov was added to [the name] Yisrael. Yisrael was the main [name], and Yakov was the secondary [name].”",
            "Similar to this [it says]: “Do not remember what happened in the past…” (Isaiah 43:18-19) “Do not remember what happened in the past:” this is [referring to] the burden of the kingdoms [of Persia, Greece and Rome]. “… and do not think about what happened in the days of old:” this is [referring to] the burden of Egypt. “Behold, I am going to do something new, now it will spring forward. Don’t you know about it?” this is [referring to] the war of Gog. They (i.e. the Rabbis) have said a parable to what this is similar to. [This is similar] to a person who came upon a wolf and was saved from him. Then he was telling [everybody about] the incident with the wolf. Then he came upon a lion and was saved from him. He forgot the incident with the wolf and was telling [everybody about] the incident with the lion. Then he came upon a snake and was saved from it. He forgot the incidents of both of them (i.e. the wolf and the lion) and was telling [everybody about] the incident with the snake. So to the Jewish People, the recent troubles make them forget about previous [troubles]....",
            "Similar to this [it says]: “Sarai, your wife, will not be called Sarai anymore, because her [new] name is Sarah.” (Genesis 17:15) In the beginning, she was a princess over her nation, [but] now she became a princess for all of the nations of the world, as it is said: “…because her [new] name is Sarah.” Similar to this [it says]: “And your name will not be called anymore Avram, but rather your name will be Avraham…” (Genesis 17:5) In the beginning, you were a father to Aram and now you will be a father to all people of the world, as it is said: “… because I have made you a father of a multitude of nations”.(ibid)",
            "Even though [the Tanach] goes back and calls Avraham [(Genesis 17:5)], Avram [again], [(Nehemiah 9:7) and (I Chronicles 1:27)] it is in his praise and not in his shame. To Yehoshua [(Numbers 13:16)], Hoshea [again], [(Deuteronomy 32:44)] it is in his praise and not in his shame. He is [the same] Avram before [God] spoke to him, he is [the same] Avram after [God] spoke to him. He is [the same] Hoshea before he became great , he is [the same] Hoshea after he became great. Moshe, Moshe [(Exodus 2:3)]; Avraham, Avraham [Genesis 22:11)]; Yakov, Yakov [(Genesis 46:2)]; Shmuel, Shmuel [(I Samuel 3:10)]; [all of these double expressions] are expressions of love and encouragement. They are [the same people] before [God] spoke to them and they are [the same people] after [God] spoke to them. They are [the same people] before they became great, they are [the same people] after they became great.",
            "Similar to this [it says]: “His Booth was in Shalem and His Shelter was in Tzion.” (Psalms 76:3) And what did the verse see to bring back to her (i.e. Jerusalem) [her] original name? Here it says: “Because this city has caused my anger and wrath, from the day that it was built until this day, it should be removed from my sight.” (Jeremiah 32:31) I would have thought it is in the heat even now? [However] this teaches us, “The mountain that God desired to dwell on.” (Psalms 68:17) Here it is in delight and desire; this teaches us that [God] forgave her her [self] destruction. From where [do we know] that the Shechina (God’s presence) will not return to it until it will be [just] a mountain [again as it was originally]? This teaches us, “His Booth was in Shalem and His Shelter was in Tzion.” We find that when it is complete it is called a mountain. But the Shechina will not return to it until it will become [just] a mountain, as it is said: “And Avraham called the name of that place ‘Hashem Yireh’ as it is [commonly] said today ’on the mountain Hashem appears’.” (Genesis 22:14) And it is said: “Remember Hashem the day [that] Jerusalem [was destroyed], [and take revenge on] the Edomites who said, Raze it. Raze it down to its foundation.” (Psalms 137:7) When [will the Shechina return to it]? When its foundations will be uprooted by those who say, “Raze it. Raze it down to its foundation.”"

            "One who reads Shema [in the morning], must mention the Exodus from Egypt in [the Beracha (blessing) after the Shema called,] Emet Veyatziv. Rebbi says, “He must [also] mention in it Kingship [of God].” Others say, “He must [also] mention in it the Plague of the Firstborn and the Splitting of the Sea.”",
            "One who reads the Shema must have intent in his heart. Rebbi Achai says in the name of Rebbi Yehudah: “If he had intent in his heart in the first paragraph [of Shema], even though he did not have intent in his heart in the last (i.e. second) paragraph [of Shema], he fulfilled his obligation [of saying the Shema].”",
            "One that reads the Shema backwards [i.e. out of order] does not fulfill his obligation [of saying the Shema]. And the same [applies] to Hallel, to prayer [of Shemoneh Esreh], and to the Megillah [of Esther].",
            "One who was reading the Shema and made a mistake, and skipped in it one verse, [he] should not begin to read that verse by itself, but rather should go back to that verse and complete [the Shema, from that point on] until the end. And the same [applies] to Hallel, to prayer [of Shemoneh Esreh], and to the Megillah [of Esther]. One who entered a synagogue and found that [the congregation] has read half of it (i.e. the Shema) and [he] completed [the remaining half of the Shema] with them, [he] should not go back and read it (i.e. the Shema) from the beginning until that place, but rather [he] should begin from the beginning and complete it until the end.

            "One who reads the Shema and makes a mistake, and [he] does not know where he made the mistake, [he] should go back to the beginning of the [first] paragraph. If he made a mistake in the middle of a paragraph, he should go back to the beginning of [that] paragraph. If he made a mistake between the first [verse that mentions] writing and the second [verse that mentions] writing, he should go back to the first [verse that mentions] writing.",

Rebbi says, “Just like they do not interrupt [their work] for [the] prayer of [Shemoneh Esreh], so too they do not interrupt [their work] to read the Shema.” Rebbi Chananya Ben Akavya says, “Just like they interrupt [their work] to read the Shema, so too they interrupt [their work] for [the] prayer [of Shmoneh Esreh].” Rebbi Elazar Bar Tzadok said, “When Rabban Gamliel and his Bet Din were in Yavneh, they were involved in the needs of the community and they did not interrupt [their work] in order not to lose [concentration] from their hearts.”",
            "A carrier, even though his burden is on his shoulder, he may read [the Shema].

But [if they are on top of] all other trees, they [must] go down to pray [Shmoneh Esreh]. The owner of the house [must] go down regardless [what kind of tree he is on top of] and pray [Shmoneh Esreh]. Workers [must] read the Shema and say a Beracha (blessing) before it and after it. [When] they eat their bread they [must] say the Beracha before it and after it. And they [must] pray three times [a day] Shmoneh Esreh, but they do not go in front of the pulpit [to lead the congregation].",

            "They have buried the dead [person] and lined up in a row. The [outer] row that sees the inner [row] is exempt [from saying the Shema] and the [outer] row that does not see the inner [row] is obligated [to say the Shema].

The people that see the inner row are exempt [from saying the Shema], and some say, “those who are behind them [are exempt as well].” And those that do not see the inner row are obligated [to say the Shema]. The one that says the eulogy and all of those who are involved in the eulogy stop [the eulogy] to read the Shema, but they do not stop [the eulogy] to pray [the Shmoneh Esreh].

And the Chachamim (Sages) say, ”He may read the Shema and he may [read it loud enough so that he can] hear [himself talking] with his own ear, and he says the Beracha [both] before it and after it.” Rebbi Meir said, “One time we were sitting in the Bet Midrash (Study Hall) in front of Rebbi Akiva and we were reading the Shema, but we were not saying it loud enough to be able to hear ourselves, because of one inquisitor who was standing by the door.” They (i.e. Chachamim) said [back] to him, “The time of danger is not a proof.”",

[However] it explains in Daniel, “… and three times a day he prayed on his knees …” (Daniel 6:11) I would have thought that [a person] can pray facing any direction he wants. [However] the verse teaches us, “… where in the attic he had windows facing Yerushalayim …” (ibid.) I would have thought that [Daniel] only began to pray after he was exiled. [However] the verse teaches us, “… just as he had always done.” (ibid.)",

[However] it explains by Chana, “and Chana was talking in her heart…” (I Samuel 1:13) I would have thought [a person] may pray all [three Shmoneh Esreh] in one shot. [However] it explains by David, “Evening, and morning, and afternoon…” (Psalms 55:18) Evening that is the Maariv prayer, morning that is the Shacharit prayer, and afternoon that is the Mincha prayer. I would have thought that [first a person] should ask for his [personal] needs and then he [should] pray [the established text of Shmoneh Esreh] and go away [from standing in front of God]. [However] it explains by Shlomo, “… to hear the song and the prayer …” (I Kings 8:28) Song that is the song,4 prayer that is the request. And so it says, “Sing before Hashem…” (Psalms 33:1)",

What is a short prayer [of Shmoneh Esreh]? Rebbi Elazar says, “Do Your will in heaven above, and give pleasure to those that fear you on earth, and do what is good in your eyes. Blessed the One that hears prayer.” Rebbi Yossi says, “Hear the voice of the prayer of your nation Israel and fulfill their requests quickly. Blessed the One that hears prayer.” Rebbi Elazar Bar Tzadok says, “Hear the voice of the cry of your nation Israel and fulfill their requests quickly. Blessed the One that hears prayer.” Others say, “Your nation Israel has many needs, but they are short minded. May it be your will Hashem our God that You may give to each one all of his needs and to each creature so that they should not lack. Blessed the One that hears prayer.” Rebbi Elazar Bar Tzadok says, “My father used to pray a short prayer [of Shmoneh Esreh] on Shabbat nights: ‘And from your love Hashem our God that you love Your nation Israel, and from Your compassion, our King, that you had on the children of Your covenant, you have given us, Hashem our God, this great and holy Seventh day, with love.’” And over the cup [of Kiddush (sanctification)] he says, “Who has sanctified the day of Shabbat” and he does not seal off [the Beracha (blessing)].",

To them alone the earth was given…’ (Job 15:18-19)” He (i.e. Rebbi Tarfon) said to them (i.e. to the four elders), “Do they give reward for a transgression? But rather what is [the real] reason why did [the tribe of] Yehudah merit the kingship of Israel?” [The four elders said back to Rebbi Tarfon,] “Because he (i.e. Yehudah) saved his brother (i.e. Yosef) from death, as it is said, ‘Yehudah said to his brothers, “What benefit [will we have] if we kill our brother?”’ (Genesis 37:26) and it is written, ‘Let us go and sell him to the Ishmaelites…’ (Genesis 37:27)”8 He (i.e. Rebbi Tarfon) said [back] to them (i.e. the four elders), “It is enough that [the act of] saving [him] should [serve] as forgiveness for the [act of] selling [him to the Ishmaelites]. But rather what is [the real] reason why did [the tribe of] Yehudah merit the kingship of Israel?” [The four elders said back to Rebbi Tarfon,] “Because of [Yehudah’s] humility, as it is said, ‘And now your servant (i.e. Yehudah) will become a slave to my master (i.e. Yosef) instead of the boy (i.e. Binyamin).’ (Genesis 44:33) Also [the only reason that] Shaul merited the kingship [of Israel] was due to [his] humility, as it is said, ‘… may be my father will turn his attention away from the donkeys and will start to worry about us.’ (I Samuel 9:5) [Since Shaul said “us” and not “me”] he considered his servant as [important as] himself, but Shmuel did not do so, but rather [he said], ‘Your father stopped worrying about the donkeys and is worried about you, saying “What will happen to my son?”’ (I Samuel 10:2) And when he (i.e. Shaul) runs away from [accepting his newly appointed role of] leadership what does it say? ‘And they have asked God, “Is the man even here?” and God said, “Here he is hiding by the vessels.”’ (I Samuel 10:22)” He (i.e. Rebbi Tarfon) said [back] to them (i.e. the four elders), “Is not he (i.e. Yehudah) a cosigner? And in the end [it is the responsibility] of a cosigner to fulfill his pledge. But rather what is [the real] reason why did [the tribe of] Yehudah merit the kingship of Israel?” They said to him, “Teach us our master.” He said to them, “[The reason the tribe of Yehudah merited the kingship of Israel is] because they sanctified God’s name on the sea. When [all of] the tribes came and stood by the sea, this one said, ‘I will go down [into the water first]’ and this one said, ‘I will go down [into the water first].’ The tribe of Yehudah jumped up and went in first and sanctified God’s name [by doing so]. And regarding that moment it says [in Tehillim], ‘Save me God, because the water is up to my soul.’ (Psalms 69:2) And it also says, ‘When Yisrael was going out of Egypt, the children of Yakov from the nation of a foreign tongue, Yehudah was His sanctifier…’ (Psalms 114:1-2) Since Yehudah sanctified God’s name on the sea, therefore ‘…Yisrael his subjects.’ (ibid.) ”",

Hands do not [need to be] washed [by Torah law, when eating] Chulin (ordinary food that does not have any special holiness to it).

How many different types of wine he brought in front of us? How many different pieces [of meat] he brought in front of us? How many different types of fine white bread he brought in front of us?
