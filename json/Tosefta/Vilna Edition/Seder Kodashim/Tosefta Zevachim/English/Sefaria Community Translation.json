            "One who slaughters a sacrifice [with the intention] to eat its fats and to burn its flesh, to eat something that he does not normally eat and to burn something that he does not normally burn -- [the sacrifice is deemed ritually] fit, but Rabbi Yehuda disqualifies it (cf. Zev. 3:3, \"Rabbi Eliezer disqualifies it\"). [One who slaughters with the intention] to leave over its blood and its fats for the next day, or to take them outside [the Temple] -- it is fit, but Rabbi Yehuda disqualifies it. Rabbi Elazar says, \"Rabbi Eliezer disqualifies it and Rabbi Yehoshua deems it fit.\" Rabbi Yehuda said to them, \"What if he [intended to] leave over the blood for the next day -- does he not disqualify it?\" And the Sages say, \"Either way it is valid. You are not able to disqualify [a sacrifice] except with a[n improper] thought of eating or burning or sprinkling blood.\" Said Rebbi, one time we were sitting before Rabbi Elazar, and Issi the Babylonian was sitting before him, and my father was sitting next to him. He said to him, \"Rabbi, one who slaughters the sacrifice [with the intention] to eat its fats and to burn its flesh -- what is the ruling?\" He said to him, \"It is fit.\" \"[And one who intends] to leave over its blood and its fats for the next day or to take them outside [the Temple] -- what is the ruling?\" He said to him, \"It is fit, only that Rabbi Eliezer disqualifies it and Rabbi Yehoshua deems it fit.\" He said to him, \"Teach me the halacha (lit., \"the matter\").\" And he taught it to him. The [time for] <i>mincha</i> arrived at his place (i.e., the place of Rabbi Elazar), and he [again] said, \"Rabbi, teach me the halacha.\" And he taught it to him [again]. He said to him, \"What is this, Yosei*? Does it seem to you that your own teachings are not precise?\" He said to him, \"It is so, Rabbi. Rather, Rabbi Yehuda taught us 'disqualified' and I returned to all my colleagues and I did not find a single one of my colleagues who held [that way]; [thus, I thought that] perhaps I had made a mistake. Now that you told me over this teaching in the name of Rabbi Eliezer, what I had lost was restored to me.\" His eyes were filled with tears. He said, \"Fortunate are the righteous ones that that you hold the Torah so dear, to establish what is said (Ps. 119:97), 'How I love your Torah[, it is my constant devotion].' Because Yehuda is the son of Rabbi Ilai, and Ilai was the student of Rabbi Eliezer. Therefore he teaches over the teachings of Rabbi Eliezer.\" (*Note: \"Issi\" is the Babylonian form for Yosei/Yosef, see Pes. 113b:18, and Jastrow (\"איסי\")."
