            "Why did they say that a virgin was married on Wednesday? For if he had a virginity claim, he would get up early to go to court. If so, let her be married on Sunday! Rather, because they could attend to all their needs for as many days of the week as possible, they decreed that he should marry her on Wednesday. From the danger and onwards, they decreed that he should marry on Tuesday, and the Sages did not object to them. If he wants to get married on Monday, they do not listen to him. If it is because of factors beyond their control, it is allowed. Why do the groom and bride separate on the first Friday night? Because he would make a bruise [when causing her to lose her virginity, and it is forbidden to cause a wound on Shabbat]. Why did they say that a widow should be married on Thursday? Because, if he married her on Sunday, the rest of the week he would leave her and go back to work; they decreed that he should marry her on Thursday, in order that he should be idle for 3 days (Thursday, Friday, Saturday), and through these idle days, it would result in him being happy with her for 3 days.",
            "An adult man that had sex with a minor woman, and a minor man who had sex with an adult woman or one who had lost their hymen through means other than sex (mukat etz), her ketubah is 200 zuz. They said in the name of Rabbi Yehudah ben Igra: Which is a minor woman and which is a minor man? A minor man is less than 9 years and 1 day; a minor woman is less than 3 years and 1 day. A man who marries (sic., נושא ונותן = do business with, doesn't make sense here) into the priesthood, and a woman who does, it is a decree that they decreed in court that an Israelite's daughter to a priest, a priest's daughter to an Israelite man—he gives 400 zuz.

A deaf-mute or not sound of mind man that marry a typical woman, even if the deaf-mute or not sound of mind man subsequently recover, they to not have a ketubah. If they want to uphold it, they give a ketubah of 100 zuz. A Gentile or a slave man that has sex with a Jewish woman, even if they subsequently convert or are freed, they do not have a ketubah. If they want to uphold it, they give a ketubah of 100 zuz. A Jewish man that has sex with a maidservant or Gentile woman, even if they subsequently convert or are freed, they do not have a ketubah. If he wants to uphold it, he gives a ketubah of 100 zuz.",
            "An adult woman and a woman incapable of having children (aylonit)—their ketubah is 200. If she is married on the presumption that she was fit to bear children but it turned out that she was incapable, she has no ketubah. If he wants to uphold it, he gives a ketubah of 100 zuz.",

A blind woman or one incapable of having children (aylonit), they have a virginity claim. Sumkhus said in the name of Rabbi Meir: A blind woman does not have a virginity claim.",
            "Said Rabbi Yehudah: In the old days in Judea, they used to investigate the groom and the bride for 3 days before the marriage; but in Galilee they did not do this. In the old days in Judea, they used to seclude the groom and the bride one moment before the marriage in order that he should desire her; but in Galilee they did not do this. In the old days in Judea, they used to set up two wedding guest guards, one from the groom's house and one from the bride's house (but even so they would only set them up for marriage); but in Galilee, they did not do this. In the old days in Judea, the wedding guest guards would sleep in the place where the groom and bride slept; but in Galilee they did not do this. Anyone who does not practice according to this [i.e. their appropriate, local] custom cannot claim a virginity claim.",
            "[Translating from Lieberman over printed edition here:] If he took her in under the presumption that she was fit to have children but it turned out that she was unable to bear children (sic!, Lieberman corrects: under the presumption that she was a virgin but it turned out that she had had sex), even if she had secret contact [with a man that her husband had warned her not to be alone with, part of the legal process of declaring her a sotah] and there are witnesses that she was not secluded with him with enough time for sex, her second husband is not able to claim a virginity claim; therefore, her ketubah is only 100 zuz. Virginity claims have a time limit of 30 days—words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yose says: If she had secret contact [with a warned man], then [the claim can and should be brought] immediately; if she had no secret contact, then even after 30 days.",
            "One who sent out a bad rumour [about his wife that she had an affair], and his witnesses turned out to be scheming—he is lashed and pays 400 zuz, and the schemers are advanced to the stoning house. If she is fatherless [so there is no father to pay the fine to]—he is lashed, her ketubah remains, he pays 400 zuz, and the schemers are advanced to the stoning house. If he didn't tell the witnesses to testify but rather they came and testified of their own accord—he is not lashed and he does not pay 400 zuz, but the schemers are advanced to the stoning house. If she whored when she was a youth, but once she became an adult he sent out a bad rumour, he is not lashed and he does not pay 400 zuz, but she and her scheming witnesses are advanced to the stoning house.",
            "If she were pregnant and they said to her: \"What is the nature of this foetus?\", [and she said:] \"It is from Ploni the kohen\"—Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Eliezer say: She is believed since this is testimony that a woman is fit for. Rabbi Yehoshua says: She is not believed. Rabbi Yehoshua said to them: Do you not agree that, regarding a captive woman who was captured among the Gentiles, who has witnesses that she were captured, and she says \"I am pure\" that she is not believed!? They said to him: No! You would say this with a captive woman who has witnesses [that she was captured], can you say it about this one who has no witnesses [that she had a child with this man]!? He said to them: But what greater testimony is there than this, that her womb is between her teeth!? He said to them: There is no guardian for illicit sexual relations [i.e. women aren't expected to check the lineage of their sexual partners, so we have no idea if the father of the foetus is in fact pasul]. When does this apply [that a woman's testimony can be believed]? For testimony about her body [i.e. whether she can go onto marry a kohen or not], but with the child everyone agrees that he is a shetuki [a genealogical blemish belonging to someone whose father is unknown]."

If after their testimony was investigated in court they said \"We are liars\", they are not believed. This is the rule of the matter: Witnesses that testify to declare something impure, pure, to distance, to bring closer, to forbid, to permit, to exempt, to obligate—if, before their testimony was examined in court they said \"We are liars\", they are believed; [but] if after their testimony was investigated in court they said \"We are liars\", they are not believed.",
            "The legal power of a contract is stronger than that of witnesses [in some respects], and the legal power of witnesses is stronger than that of a contract [in other respects]. The power of a contract is stronger: a contract can remove a wife from her husband, which is not true of witnesses. The power of witnesses is stronger: witnesses that said \"Ploni is dead\", his wife can remarry; if \"Ploni is dead\" were written in a contract, his wife cannot remarry; if they said \"What is written in this contract we heard but then forgot\", his wife can remarry—a man who writes his testimony in a contract and testifies about it can continue to do so even after 100 years!",

For a contract can [enable one to] collect from mortgaged property, which is not true of money. But the power of money is stronger: money can redeem arakhin (an item whose value is dedicated to the Temple), haramin (items dedicated to the Temple and/or doomed to destruction), sanctified items and second tithe, which is not true of a contract. The legal power of a contract and money is stronger than that of usucaption (hazakah, presumption of ownership) [in some respects], and the legl power of usucaption is stronger than that of contract and money [in other respects]. Usucaption is stronger: if he sold him 10 fields, when he possesses any one of them, he has acquired them all; but, if he payed him only the amount of one of them, or only wrote for him one of them [in the contract], he acquires only that field.",
            "The 200 zuz for a virgin, 100 for a widow, nezek (damages for injury), half nezek, double payments (for stealing some kinds of property), four- and fivefold payments (for stealing other kinds of property)—all of them, even though they are not written in a contract, they are collected [even] from mortgaged property.",
            "The wife who said, \"I am married\", but came back and said, \"I am not married\" is believed, since the mouth that forbade is the mouth that permitted. If she said: \"I was captured but I am pure [i.e. did not have sex with her captives], and I have witnesses that I am pure!\", they don't say: \"Let's wait until the witnesses come and permit her\", but rather permit her [to return to her husband or subsequently marry a kohen] immediately. If, after they permitted her, witnesses came and said, \"She was captured\", then she cannot remarry. (The next section is not in good manuscripts). If [the witnesses said] \"She was captured and is impure\", even if she had children, she has to leave the marriage. If one witness says \"She was captured and is impure\", [or] one witness says \"She was captured and is pure\", [or] a woman says \"She was captured and is impure\", [or] a woman says \"She was captured and is pure\"—all of these she should not be remarried; but if she does remarry, she shouldn't leave the marriage.",

[If she says:] \"I am pure but my fellow is impure\" is not believed. \"I and my fellow are impure\" is believed about herself but not believed about her fellow. \"I and my fellow are pure\" is believed about her fellow but not believed about herself.",
            "And similarly with two men—this one says, \"My fellow is a kohen\" and the other one says, \"My fellow is a kohen\"—they give to them [the priestly gifts]; but for priestly pedigree [i.e. to pass onto their children] they are not believed until there are 3 men, in order that 2 of them testify about the 3rd and the other 2 testify about the other 3rd. Rabbi Yehudah says: They don't even give them [the priestly gifts] until there are 2 to testify about this one and 2 to testify about this one. They raise someone to the priesthood, to being a Levite or an Israelite on the basis of one witness; but they do not lower someone except on the basis of 2 witnesses. Rabbi Yehudah says: Just as they don't lower someone except on the basis of 2, they don't raise except on the basis of 2.",
            "Rabbi Lazar said: When [does this apply]? When there is a legal complaint in court [about the guy's status], but when there is no legal complaint in court, they raise to the priesthood on the basis of 1 witness. What constitutes a legal complaint? If they said: \"How did Ploni jump into the priesthood?\", \"He never did the priestly blessing in shul\", \"He never took his priestly portion\"—this is not a legal complaint. [If they said:] \"He is son of a divorcée\", \"son of a halutzah\", \"a natin\" or \"a bastard\"—this is a legal complaint. Rabbi raised [someone] to the priesthood based on 1 witness. Rabbi Yose raised [someone] to the priesthood based on 1 witness.",
            "If rumour was spreading in town—Rabbi Yose says: Rumour is not evidence, rather anyone who has a valid legal complaint should come [to court] and say it. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Ha-Sgan: They raise [someone] to the priesthood based on 1 witness, and not even just 1 witness but even on the basis of a woman['s testimony]. And the woman doesn't even have to come to court, just when she said \"They gave to him\" [his priestly gifts, this off-hand comment is enough to raise someone to the priesthood]."

            "There are 2 grounds for presumption of being a priest in Eretz Yisrael: doing the priestly blessing and taking one's portion from the threshing floor. But in Suria and until the place that the Rosh Hodesh heralds arrive, doing the priestly blessing [is a ground for presumption] but not taking one's portion from the threshing floor. Bavel is like Suria. Rabbi Shimon ben Lazar says: Also in Alexandria originally, since there was a court there. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Just as terumah is a ground for presumption for being a priest when one takes it from the threshing floor, so too is first tithe a ground for presumption for being a Levite when one takes it from the threshing floor. One who takes his portion in a court does not have grounds for presumption to being a priest.",
            "Everyone is believed to testify about her [see Lieberman: the wife of a priest in a captured city, who is presumed to have been raped, becomes forbidden to her husband; but if she has witnesses that she was not raped, she is believed and permitted to her husband]—even her son, even her daughter—except for her and her husband, for a person can't testify about themselves. Said Rabbi Zecharyah ben Ha-Katzav: By the Temple! [My wife's] hand did not leave from mine from the moment the Gentiles entered Jerusalem until they left—but even so, he designated for her a house for herself, she was sustained from his property, and she is not secluded with him except with her children.",

But [if they testified] \"Others used to bring to him [his portion]\", they are not believed (although, Ehrfurt: they are believed). If [they testified] \"He was a Gentile and converted\", \"A slave and he was freed\"—then these are not believed. They are not believed to say, \"I remember that Ploni owed Plonit (Ehrfurt: Ploni) a maneh\"; or \"Ploni's path went through Ploni's field\" since this is like monetary cases. Rabbi Yohanan ben Berokah says: They are believed.",
            "Said Rabbi Yohanan ben Berokah: A wife or minor is believed to say \"From here the bee swarm left\". When does this apply? When they are testifying right there. But if they go out and come back, they are not believed, since they only say this because of persuasion and fear [that people with power over them have instilled in them]. Men, wives, slaves and minors are believed to say \"This place is impure\" or \"This place is pure\".",

A man who has sex with a deaf-mute woman, with an insane woman, with an adult woman and with a woman who lost her virginity not through sex (mukkat etz)—they do not have the fine [proscribed by the Torah]. A blind woman and a woman incapable of having children—they have the fine.",

And so too Rabbi Nehunya ben Ha-Kanah used to say: Yom Kippur is like Shabbat for monetary fines [on both, for many transgressions, he is exempt from monetary fines because he is liable for death or karet].",

Rabbi Shimon says: Neither of them pay the pain payment because in the end she wants it. They said to him: One who has sex willingly is not similar to one who has sex unwillingly.",
            "Even though they said a rapist pays immediately, when he takes [her] out [of the marriage after they got married as part of his punishment and he decided to divorce her], he pays nothing [for the ketubah]. Rabbi Yose bar Rabbi Yehudah says: He gives a ketubah of 100 zuz. Even though they said a seducer pays when he takes [her] out, he pays her shame and blemish payments immediately. What is the difference between paying immediately (for the rapist) and paying later (for the seducer)? If he pays immediately, if she dies, her father inherits it; if he pays later, if she dies, her husband inherits it [in other words, he sometimes won't have to pay since he could get the money back].",

If they are priests [and so can't get remarried to someone they divorced], they are lashed with 40 lashes. Whether its the rapist or the seducer, either she or her father can prevent [the marriage], as it is said, \"If objecting her father objects\" (Shemot 22:16) [proving her father's consent is required] and it is said, \"She will be for him a wife\" (Shemot 22:19)—i.e. with her consent [as well].

If she gave him a receipt for some of her ketubah, she has given him a receipt for all of it, for thus she writes to him [in the receipt]: \"My responsibility for you is upon me from now\" [the derash being that all responsibilities have to cease, there is no giving a receipt for some of the ketubah and maintaining the rest].",

Anywhere they double the ketubah, she can only collect half.

            "The adult woman is like (sic!) one claimed—they give her 12 months. If she were a minor, either she or her father is able to delay [the marriage until she is of majority age]. Rabbi Tarfon says: They give her everything terumah [if she is claimed by a priest and the time limit of 12 months is up and they are still not married, she eats entirely terumah]. When does this apply? From betrothal [i.e. when the claiming 12 months is up, she is betrothed but still not married], but from marriage, Rabbi Tarfon agrees that they give her half hullin and half terumah. When does this apply? With a kohen's daughter [married to a] kohen, but an Israelite's daughter to a kohen, everyone agrees they raise all of her food from hullin. Rabbi Yehudah ben Betera says: Two parts terumah and one hullin. Rabbi Yehudah says: She should sell the terumah and buy with its value hullin. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Any place where they [the sages] mention \"terumah\", he gives double hullin. This was the original mishnah. Our rabbis said: A wife who is an Israelite's daughter doesn't eat terumah until she enters the bridal chamber, and a yevamah doesn't [eat terumah] until she has sex [with her levir]. If her husband dies [after the time of claiming has passed], he inherits her. Said Rabbi Menahem ben Nafah in the name of Rabbi Liezer Ha-Kappar: A case, that Rabbi Tarfon who betrothed 300 wives for them to eat terumah, for they were years of famine. But Yohanan ben Bagbag already sent to Rabbi Yehudah ben Beterah to Netzivin, he said to him: I heard about you that you say a betrothed Israelite's daughter betrothed to a kohen can eat terumah. He replied to him and said to him: I had assumed that you were an expert in the chambers of Torah, but you don't know how to do a kal va-homer! Just as a Canaanite slavegirl, whose sex [with a kohen] does not acquire her to allow her to eat terumah, isn't it logical that money would acquire her to eat terumah!? But what can I do? For the Hakhamim said: A betrothed Israelite's daughter can't eat terumah until she enters the bridal chamber. If she dies, her father inherits her.",

Her inheritance and her finding (sic!, inserted based on Ehrfurt manuscript) a lost object—whether [she is supported by the levirs] or not, they belong to her.

If he left his brothers money, or the yevamah had money in a debt to her husband, he shouldn't say \"Since I inherit, I will seize [them]\"—rather, they take [them] away from him and buy with them land [i.e. property] and he eats the fruit [i.e. gets the profits from it].",

Rather, she should write them in a gift [contract with the words:] \"From today until the moment that I want [to take the property back]\".",

How so? He can sell the fruit and buy with [that money] land, and he can eat the fruit. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and Rabbi Yohanan ben Berokah say: If she dies, he inherits it [the fruit, even if he said he wouldn't have access to it in the ketubah], for she made a stipulation against what was written in the Torah and anyone who stipulates against what is written in the Torah, his stipulation is null and void.",
            "One who dies and leaves moveable property, and there is upon him [the responsibility for] his wife's ketubah and [for] a creditor—anyone who comes first [to claim their money] wins out [even to the extent that there is nothing left in his property such that] he is buried from charity funds.",

If he wrote for her [in the ketubah]: \"I will have no vow or oath upon you\", the inheritors are not able to cause her to swear on things that were used after the death of her husband [that she didn't use them and therefore owes no money]. When does this apply? When she went from her husband's grave to her father's house. But, if she went from her husband's grave to her father-in-law's house, even if he wrote for her \"I will have no vow or oath upon you\", the inheritors are able to make her swear about property she used after her husband's death.",

One who gets a loan from [his fellow] on the 6th or 7th year, and in the 8th year is made for him a business partner or a tenant, is exempt [from being made to swear an oath related to his loan, but still can be made to swear an oath on his partnership or tenancy, because the 7th year annulled the loan and anything related to it]. But, if he is made for him a partner or tenant on the 6th or 7th year, and in the 8th year returns and takes a loan from him, they roll over him everything [i.e. he can be made to swear both oaths].",

He said to her: \"You received your ketubah\", and she says, \"I didn't receive it but it was only 100 zuz\"—she can collect without an oath. [She can't collect her ketubah from] mortgaged property [without an oath]—one doesn't even need to say this for after her husband's death, but even during her husbands life.

[If she has] a ketubah but she doesn't have a get—she can't collect anything, because if she says \"I lost my get\", he can say \"I lost my receipt\". Originally, they used to say (compare to Mishnah Ketubot 9:9): One who divorces her [with] her ketubah, she needs to go out with a get—words of Rabbi Meir.

A get, a ketubah and a death—if the get is from before the ketubah, she can collect two ketubot; if the ketubah is from before the get, she can only collect one ketubah, for [it must be that] the one who divorced her took her back and took her back with the understanding that the first ketubah [remained in place]. (The following omitted in the printed edition, supplied from Ehrfurt manuscript:) If she wrote a receipt for him [for her whole ketubah] while they were married, he divorced her, took her back and died—she takes her ketubah of 100 zuz [the minimum for a non-virgin from the 2nd marriage].

If she sold her ketubah, used her ketubah as a pledge [for a loan that goes to the creditor in the meantime], used her ketubah as a security [on a loan but that remains with her]—she loses her financial support.

One doesn't need to say [that this applies] after her husband's death, but even during her husband's lifetime [if she did these things to her ketubah, she would lose her right to financial support after his death]. But [her losing her financial support only applies if] she writes [in the contract dealing with her ketubah] \"These I sold for my ketubah, these I sold for my financial support\"—words of Rabbi Yehudah.

One says \"It's worth 100 zuz\", one says \"80 zuz (= 20 selaim)\", one says \"120 zuz (= 30 selaim)\"—it is evaluated at 100 zuz (the average of all 3).
