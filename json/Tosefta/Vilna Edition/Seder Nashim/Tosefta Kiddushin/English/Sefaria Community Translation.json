            "A wife is acquired in 3 ways and can acquire herself in 2 ways. She can be acquired with money, contract or sex. How so with money? He gave her money or something worth money, he said to her: \"Behold you are betrothed to me\", \"Behold you are engaged to me\", \"Behold you are my wife\", \"Behold this one is betrothed\". But if she gave him money or something worth money and said to him \"Behold I am engaged to you\", \"Behold I am betrothed to you\", \"Behold I am your wife\"—she is not betrothed. Contract? One needs to say that the contract has to be worth a perutah—even if he wrote it on clay or bad paper, she is betrothed. With sex? All sex that is for the sake of betrothal—she is betrothed; if it is not for the sake of betrothal—she is not betrothed.",
            "A man shouldn't marry a wife until his niece is grown up or until he finds someone appropriate for him, as it is said, \"The land was full of lust\" (Vayikra 19:29). \"It is lust\" (Vayikra 20:14). Rabbi Eliezer says: This is a single man who has sex with a single woman not for the sake of marriage. Rabbi Eliezer said: From where do we know that he [the single man from the previous statement] is punished before God like the one who has sex with a woman and her mother? It is said here \"Lust\" and it is said there \"A man who marries a woman and her mother—it is lust\" (Vayikra 20:14). Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya'akov says: Because he has sex with many women and it is not known with which he has had sex; and she receives it from many men and it is not known from which of them she received it—it turns out that this man marries his daughter, this one marries his sister, and all of the world will be bastards. That's why it is said, \"The earth will be full of lust\" (zimah)—this one, what is he (zeh mah hu)? He is not a kohen, levi or Yisrael (sic! placement of this line based on Ehrfurt manuscript and the derash of זימה = זה מה). Rabbi Yehudah (sic! based on Ehrfurt manuscript) says: Behold it says \"Do not prostitute the land\" (Vayikra 19:29)—the produce degenerates. The Hakhamim decided by majority to support Rabbi Yehudah (sic!): \"Lift your eyes to the lowlands and see where you have not been ravished... and the rains have been withheld\" (Yirmiyahu 3:2-3) [i.e. your sexual immorality directly causes the rains to stop and the produce to degenerate].",
            "Which is \"deduction of price\" [through which a Hebrew slave can go free according to Mishnah Kiddushin 1:2]? He wanted to redeem himself within those [6] years [that he is a slave], he calculated the coins and the years [remaining] and payed them to his master, and the slave has the upper hand [he can calculate based on how much his price was worth when he sold himself originally or how much that would be worth now, whichever is better for him]. Which is presumption [of ownership] of land? A lock, fence or opening of any size [that belongs to him]—this is a presumption [of ownership]. Which is presumption [of ownership] of [Canaanite] slaves? If [the slave] ties [the owner's] shoe, undoes his shoe, brings vessels after him to the bathhouse—this is a presumption. If he lifted him up [e.g. to help him get on a horse]—Rabbi Shimon said: There is no greater presumption than this.",
            "[The Hebrew slave] acquires himself with [loss of] major limbs (see Shemot 21:26). He acquires himself with money via others and a contract via himself, [and he can't acquire with his own money] because he is like one who gives from the left hand to his right [i.e. whatever is his is his master's, so the money needs to come from elsewhere]—words of Rabbi Meir. But Hakhamim say: [Even] money via himself or a contract via others, as long as the money belongs to others and he says to him [when he gives him the money], \"[This is] with the understanding that you can only redeem [yourself] with this money\". Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said in the name of Rabbi Meir: Even a contract via others, but not one via himself.",
            "A ship is acquired with drawing (meshikhah). Rabbi Natan says: A ship and documents are acquired with drawing and with a contract. Which is drawing? Whether he drew [the animal], whether he drove [it], whether he called to it and it came after him—this is drawing. Which is handing over (mesirah)? Anyone who handed over to him the halter and he took it—this is handing over. In what cases did they say that moveable property is acquired with drawing? In the public road or in a courtyard which doesn't belong to either [party in the transaction]. On the property of the buyer, whenever he accepts it, he acquires.  On the property of the seller, when he lifts it or until he takes it out of the owner's property. On the property of the one with whom he deposited [the animal], until he [the bailee] accepts it [the responsibility of looking after the item for the buyer] or until he [the buyer] rents the place [where the item is stored with the bailee].",
            "One can exchange land for land, moveables for moveables, land for moveables, moveables for land—when this one takes ownership, the other one becomes liable for its exchange (see Mishnah Kiddushin 1:6).",
            "[The process of something being transferred to the] ownership of the Temple with money, how so? If the treasurer gave coins for hekdesh moveable property, he acquires the hekdesh wherever he is; but a layperson [not empowered by the authority of the Temple] doesn't acquire until the moment he draws [it]. Speech [by a Temple treasurer or another official is as effective in transferring property] to the Temple as the handing over of a layperson. How so? \"This ox is hekdesh\", \"This house is hekdesh\"—even from where to the end of the world, he acquires the hekdesh wherever he is; but a layperson only acquires when he takes possession [of it].",
            "Which is a positive time-caused mitzvah [for which women/wives are exempt]? Sukkah, lulav and tefilin. Which is a positive non-time-caused mitzvah? [Returning a] lost object, sending away the mother bird [in order to take the eggs], [setting up] a railing [on your roof] and tzitzit. Rabbi Shimon exempts wives from tzitzit because it is a positive time-caused mitzvah. Which is a mitzvah of the son about [his] father? Feeding, giving drink, clothing, anointing, taking out and bringing in, washing his face, hands and legs. [This applies to anyone] whether a man or wife, except that a man has the opportunity to do it, but a wife does not have the opportunity to do it because others [her husband] have authority over her. What is a mitzvah of the father about [his] son? To circumcise him, redeem him [with 5 selaim if he is a firstborn], to teach him Torah, to teah him a trade and to marry him to a wife. Some say: Also to swim in the river. Rabbi Yehudah says: Anyone who doesn't teach his son a trade teaches him banditry.",
            "(Translated from Ehrfurt manuscript:) Rabban Gamliel says: Anyone who has a trade, to what is he similar? To a vineyard that is surrounded by its fence, to a furrow that is surrounded by a hedge. Rabbi Yoseh says in the name of Rabban Gamliel: Anyone who has a trade, to what is he similar? To a woman that has a husband—whether she is adorned or not, everybody doesn't gaze at her, but if she is not adorned then she will have a curse [since she isn't trying to dress up for her husband]. Anyone who does not have a trade, to what is he similar? To a woman without a husband—whether she is adorned or not, everyone gazes at her, but if she is adorned she will have a curse [since she is dressing up for random men]. Rabbi Yoseh bar Rabbi Lazar said in the name of Rabban Gamliel: Anyone who has a trade, to what is he similar? To a fenced vineyard where cattle and wild animals can't enter into it, passersby can't enter into it and can't see what is in it. Anyone without a trade, to what is he similar? To an open vineyard, for cattle and wild animals enter into it, passersby enter into it and can see what is in it.",
            "Rabbi Elazar bar Rabbi Shimon says: Any mitzvah that Yisrael was obligated in before they came to the Land is practised in the Land and ouside the Land; [any mitzvah] that [Yisrael] was not obligated in before they came to the Land is only practised in the Land, except for remission of loans, redemption of sales and sending away the Hebrew slave, for even though they were not obligated in them until they came to the Land, they are practised in the Land and outside the Land.",
            "One who does 1 mitzvah, it causes good for him, it lengthens his days and his years and he inherits the soil. Anyone who does one averah, it causes bad for him, it plucks off his days and he does not inherit the land. About this one it is said, \"One sinner can destroy much good\" (Kohelet 9:18)—with a single sin, this one destroyed for him many good things. A person should always see himself as if he is half innocent and half guilty. If he does one mitzvah, he is happy that he tipped his scale to the side of innocence. If he does one averah, woe to him! he tipped his scale to the side of guilt. About this one it is said, \"One sinner can destroy much good\"—with a single sin, this one destroyed for him many good things. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says in the name of Rabbi Meir: Because an individual is judged according to the majority [of his deeds] and the world is judged according to the majority [of the deeds performed in it], one who does one mitzvah is happy that he has tipped his scales and the scales of the world to the side of innocence; if he does one averah, woe to him! he tips his scale and the scale of the world to the side of guilt. About this one it is said, \"One sinner can destroy much good\"—with a single sin, this one destroyed for him many good things. Rabbi Shimon says: If someone was righteous their entire life, but in the end rebelled, he lost everything, as it is said, \"The righteousness of the righteous will not save him on the day of his wickedness\" (Yehezkel 33:12). If someone were wicked all their life and did teshuvah at the end, God receives him, as it is said, \"He will not trip on the wickedness of the wicked on the day he returns from his wickedness\" (Yehezkel 33:12). Anyone who is engaged in all three of them—in Scripture, Mishnah and an occupation—about this person it is said, \"The threefold cord will not be quickly broken\" (Kohelet 4:12)."

            "A man who betroths a woman with idolatrous wine, with an idol, with [something belonging to] an idolatrous city [that was destroyed and everything in it turned to herem] or one of its inhabitants, with idolatrous skins, with an ashera [tree] or with its fruit, with the base [of an idolatrous altar] or what is upon it, with a markulis [stone altar to Mercury outside of houses or on roads] or what is upon it, or with anything upon which falls [the law of] forbidden [benefit from] idols—all of them, even if he sould them and betrothed [a wife] with their value—she is not betrothed. With the purifying waters or with purifying dust [from the red heifer ritual]—she is betrothed. (Rabbi Yehudah says:) If there is in the profits something worth a perutah [if you can generate incidental value from them, e.g. getting paid to move them from one place to another]—she is betrothed; but if not—she is not betrothed.",

After [that happened and] she was married, another came and said, \"I betrothed her!\"—he does not have the power to forbid her [to her current husband, even if he were telling the truth]. (Translated from the Ehrfurt manuscript:) [A man who says] \"I arranged the betrothal of my daughter\"—[we assume that this] includes minor daughters but doesn't include major daughters. \"My daughter was betrothed\"—doesn't include minor daughters. \"I [arranged the] divorce of my daughter\"—includes minor daughters, but doesn't include major daughters. \"My daughter was divorced\"—includes neither major nor minor daughters. [If a man said about his daughter:] \"She was captured and I redeemed her\", or \"She had sex with someone who would disqualify her\"—he does not have the power to make her forbidden [to subsequently marry a priest]. \"I arranged the betrothal of my daughter\" and he has 10 daughters—they are all forbidden [to marry other men until the kiddushin is broken] because of doubt. If he said \"major daughter\"—only the eldest daughter is betrothed. If he said \"minor\"—only the youngest daughter is betrothed.",

If they were planning on the eldest sister for the eldest brother and the youngest sister for the youngest brother, she says \"I am the elder sister\"—she is betrothed to the elder brother, and the younger sister is betrothed to the younger brother.",

A Gentile or slave that had sex with a daughter of Israel and she bore a son—the child is a bastard (mamzer).

Rabbi Yehudah says: There are 4 congregations [that are all permitted to marry each other]—kohanim, levi'im, yisrael, converts, and anyone else [not in any of those 4 congregations] is allowed to marry each other. But Hakhamim say: There are 3 congregations—kohanim, levi'im, yisrael. Rabbi Eliezer says: Anyone who is forbidden to marry into the congregation—two people who each have certain status are permitted [to marry each other]; one person with certain status with one person with doubtful status, doubtful with certain and doubtful with doubtful are forbidden [to marry each other].",

A male convert, freed slave and disqualified priest are permitted [to marry] a female priest. Which is [a person whose lineage is mixed like] dough (isah, see Mishnah Eduyot 8:3)? Anyone [with mixed lineage but] who doesn't have [any suspicion of having ancestors with] netinut, mamzerut or kings' slaves. Said Rabbi Meir: Anyone who doesn't have netinut, mamzerut or kings' slaves [in their heritage]—they can marry [the person] into the priesthood. Rabbi Shimon ben Lazar says in the name of Rabbi Meir, and so too Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya used to say the same: Why did they say that an isah is unfit [to marry] into the priesthood? Because of the possibility of disqualified priests [in his lineage] that they would become impure through—Jews know the netinim and mamzerim among them, but they don't know the disqualified priests among them.",
            "A daughter of a male disqualified priest (halal) is disqualified from [marrying into] the priesthood forever. Rabbi (sic!, based on Ehrfurt manuscript) says: A daughter of a male convert is like the daughter of a male halal and disqualified from the priesthood. An isah is disqualified from the priesthood (see previous halakhah); if she [the isah] got married to a Yisrael, her daughter is fit [to marry into] the priesthood. A captive woman is disqualified from the priesthood; if she got married to a Yisrael, her daughter is fit for the priesthood. A freed handmaid is disqualified from the priesthood; if she is married to a Yisrael, her daughter is fit for the priesthood. It turns out that Yisrael is a mikveh for priests [since the daughter of a pesulah with a male Yisrael is no longer pesulah] and a handmaid is a mikveh for all disqualifications.",

Rabbi Meir said to him: \"From all your impurities and all of your abominations\" (Yehezkel 36:25) [but not from your genealogical blemishes]. Rabi Yoseh said to him: What does the verse mean when it says \"I will purify you\"?

Said Rabbi Yehudah: Minyamin (sic! name in Ehrfurt manuscript) the Egyptian convert was havruta with one of the students of Rabbi Akiva. He said: \"I am an Egyptian convert and I married an Egyptian convert. Behold I will go marry off my son to an Egyptian convert woman in order that my grandson should be fit to marry into the congregation, in order to fulfil what it says: \"The third generation let them enter the congregation of God\" (Devarim 23:9).\" Rabbi Akiva said to him: \"Minyamin you have erred in halakhah—Sanacherib, king of Assyria, came already and mixed up all of the nations; Ammonites and Moabites are not in their place, neither are Egyptians or Edomites in their place. Rather, a male Ammonite can marry a female Egyptian, a male Egyptian can marry a female Ammonite, and any one of these can marry anyone from any of the families of the earth, and any one of the families of the earth can marry any of these. It all depends on the child [whether he is able to marry into the community or not, since any of these people if they converted would be kosher Jews].\"",

If he investigated the adults, he does not need to investigate the minors. When does this apply? When [investigating a family that has] one wife. But when [the family has] 2 wives—if he investigated the mother, he needs to investigate the children; and if he investigated the adults, he needs to investigate the minors [because they might be born from different women].",

A woman/wife is believed when she says, \"These are my children\". (The following translated from the Ehrfurt manuscript:) A man is believed when he says: \"The wife that I married in the land beyond the sea—this is her and these are her children\"—he needs to bring evidence neither about the wife, nor about the children. \"[I married a wife there but] she died, and these are her children\"—he needs to bring evidence on both the wife and the children.

But she should not be secluded with any Gentiles, even 100 [of them]. His sister, his mother-in-law and any other person with whom sex would be forbidden—he should not be secluded with them except on the basis of two [witnesses].

Rabbi Yehudah says: A single man shouldn't shepherd small cattle, and two single men shouldn't sleep in one cloak. They said: Yisrael is not suspected of such [bestiality].",

Their master converts, he converts the slaves and they have a son—he is a mamzer. The female slave is freed and that slave has sex with her and they have a son—the child is a slave. They are both freed and have a son—the child is a freedman. It is possible for a man to sell to his father and pay his mother her ketubah. How so? A man who has a male and female slave and they have a son. He frees his female slave and marries her and writes his property to her son. He sells it to his father and pays his mother her ketubah.",

Rabbi says: A man should strive to teach his son a clean and easy trade, and pray to the One to Whom wealth belongs, for there is no trade that doesn't have in it poverty and wealth; this is to tell you that wealth and poverty doesn't come from trade [but from God].",

They were only created to serve me, but I was created to serve my Creator. This is a kal va-homer: Just as they who were created only to serve me are supported without pain, I who was created to serve my Creator, isn't it logical that I should be supported without pain? Rather, I impair my deeds and I ruin my support.",
            "(Translated from the Ehrfurt manuscript:) Rabbi Nehorai says: I abandoned every trade in the world and taught my children only Torah, for they eat the reward of its labour in this world but the principal remains for them in the world to come, because every trade in the world only stands for a man in his youth when his strength is upon him, but if he becomes sick, old or has troubles, he will not be able to do work and in the end will die in famine. But Torah keeps him from all evil in his youth and gives him a future and hope in his old age. In his youth, what does it say? \"Those who hope in God, He will exchange for him strength, make his limbs rise like eagles\" (Yeshayahu 40:31). In his old age, what does it say? \"In old age they produce fruit\" (Tehilim 92:15). And so too you find regarding Avraham our father, who God blessed in his old age more than in his youth, as it is said, \"The time came when Avraham was old, and God blessed Avraham with everything (ba-kol)\" (Bereishit 24:1). Rabbi Meir says: [The blessing was] that he didn't have a daughter. Rabbi Yehudah says: That he had a daughter. Rabbi Elazar ha-Moda'i says: This is the large sangenon (a kind of magical precious stone) that was in the hand of Avraham our father. Rabbi Shimon ben Yohai says: This is the beautiful jewel that hung around the neck of Avraham our father, that any sick person who saw it would immediately be healed. When Avraham our father died, God took it and hung it in the daytime. A second thing [that was his reward]: that Esav didn't rebel during his [grandfather's] lifetime. A third thing: that Yishmael did teshuvah during his [father's] lifetime. Others say: Avraham had a daughter and her name was Bakol. God blessed him in his old age more than in his youth because he did the Torah before it came, as it is said, \"Because Avraham heard My voice and kept My charge, My commands, My laws, My instructions (torot)\" (Bereishit 26:5)—it doesn't say \"My Torah\" (in singular) but \"My instructions\" (in plural), this teaches that the words of Torah and the words of scribes were revealed to him."
