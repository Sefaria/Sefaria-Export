            "Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer, he (i.e., the jealous husband) warns [his wife regarding associating with a certain man] on the testimony of one witness or on his own testimony, and she drinks [the bitter waters] on the testimony of two (se Sot. 1:1). They responded to the words of Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Yehuda, there is no end to the matter. § What is the first testimony? That is the testimony of seclusion. The second? That is the testimony of defilement. And how much time [is required] for defilement [to occur]? As much time as it takes for intercourse. And how much time does intercourse take? As much time as the first stage of intercourse. And how much time does the first stage of intercourse take? Rabbi Eliezer says, the time it takes to circle a palm tree. Rabbi Yehoshua says, the time it takes to mix a cup of wine. Ben Azzai says, the time it takes to drink it. Rabbi Akiva says, the time it takes for a weaver to tie a knot. Chanan ben Pinchas says, the time it takes her to stick a finger in her mouth. Peleimo says, the time it takes her to stick her hand into a basket and take out a loaf of bread. And even though there is no proof of the matter, there is a hint to the matter, as it says (Prov. 6:26, JPS tr.), \"The last loaf of bread will go for a harlot.\"",
            "Rabbi Yehuda says: Her husband is trusted regarding her (i.e., not to have had relations with his wife on the journey to the Temple to perform the Sotah ceremony (see Sot. 1:3)). [This is learned out] from a <i>kal v'chomer</i>: Just as [the husband of a] menstruant, who is liable for excision if he has relations with her, is believed regarding her, [then with respect to the husband of a] suspected adulteress, who is not liable for excision if he has relations with her, is it not logical that her husband should be believed regarding her? They said to him: All the more so, since he is not liable for excision for having relations with her, should he not be believed regarding her<sup>*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., since his punishment is light, he would have less incentive to lie than one faced with excision</i>? Another version: [They said to him,] Not so. If you say that regarding a menstruant, who has permissible factors after the prohibition started<sup>*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., there will be a time when her menstrual flow ceases and she is permitted to her husband</i>, would you say the same regarding a suspected adulteress, who has no permissible factors after the prohibition started? And thus it says (Prov. 9:17, JPS tr.), \"Stolen waters are sweet[, And bread eaten furtively is tasty].\" Rabbi Yosei says, Scripture itself believes him regarding her, as it is said (Num. 5:15), \"And the man shall bring his wife to the Kohen.\"",
            "[If the suspected adulteress says that she is pure,] they bring her up to the Eastern Gate, to the Gate of Nicanor, which is where they give the suspected adulteress [the bitter waters] to drink, and [where] they purify women after childbirth, and purify lepers, as it is said (1 Kings 8:31-32), \"Whenever a man sins against his neighbor [... and he brings it before Your Altar in this House], You shall hear, O Heavens, and take action and judge Your servants, condemning the wicked to bring down his conduct upon his head\" -- [this refers to] (Num. 5:27): \"Her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall fall.\" \"And to vindicate the righteous, to bestow upon him according to his righteousness\" (1 Kings 8:32) -- [this refers to] (Num. 5:27): \"But if the woman did not defile herself and she is pure, she is to be held innocent and she shall bear seed.\" § She stands within and the Kohen stands without, as it is said (Num. 5:18), \"And the Kohen shall stand the woman before Hashem,\" and there is no Kohen who is \"before\" Hashem. § Just as they believe [the husband] regarding her so that she will retract [her innocence and confess her guilt (see Sot. 14a:15)], they believe him regarding her so that she will <i>not</i> retract. They say to her, \"My daughter, if it is clear to you that you are pure, stand on your clarity and drink, for these waters are similar only to dry poison that is placed on living flesh, which does no damage [as long as the skin is intact], but which if a wound is found there, it penetrates and goes down [into the bloodstream].\" (See Sot. 7b:4, Steinsaltz.)",
            "They do not give [the bitter waters] to two suspected adulteresses to drink at one time, so that the heart of one will not be strengthened by the other. Rabbi Yehuda says, it is not for that reason. Rather, it is because of what it says (Num. 5:16), \"The Kohen shall bring her close [and stand her before Hashem].\" He brings <i>her</i> close, and he does not bring two close.",
            "The Kohanim draw lots among themselves [to determine who will participate in the Sotah ceremony]. Whoever's lot is drawn, even [if it is the lot of] the Kohen Gadol, he goes out and stands next to the Sotah, and he grabs ahold of her clothes (Sot. 1:5). If they are torn, so be it, and if they are rent apart (i.e., exposing her flesh), so be it, even until her chest (lit., \"her heart\") is bared, and he [also] loosens her hair. Rabbi Yehuda says, if her chest was attractive, he would not bare it, and if her hair was attractive, he would not loosen it, because of the young Kohanim (whose desire would be aroused).",
            "[The Mishnah (Sot. 2:2) states that when the dust from the floor of the Temple is placed in the earthenware vessel, it \"must be seen\" floating on top of the bitter waters. The Tosefta comments:] Three [things] must be seen on top of water: The ashes of the [red] heifer, and the dust of the Sotah, and the blood of the bird [offering used to purify a leper (see Lev. 14:4-7)]. The ashes of the [red] heifer must be of sufficient quantity that they can be seen on top of the waters [of purification] (Par. 3:3). The dust of the Sotah must be of sufficient quantity that it can be seen on top of the [bitter] waters (Sot. 2:2). The blood of the bird [offering] of the leper must be of sufficient quantity that it can be seen on top of the [living] water (see Sot. 16b:6-8). [Relatedly,] the spittle of a Yevama (Deut. 25:9) must be of sufficient quantity that it can be seen by the eyes of the Elders.",
            "The Kohanim are permitted to pour wine, oil, and honey onto the remainders of the [Sotah's] meal offering (see Sot. 2:1), but they are forbidden to cause it to become leavened. All meal offerings that are [prescribed] in the Torah require oil and frankincense except for the meal offering of the sinner and the meal offering of jealousy, as it is said (Num. 5:15), \"He shall not pour oil onto it, nor place frankincense on it, etc.\" Rabbi Shimon says, all the sin offerings that are in the Torah do not require a libation except for the sin offering and the guilt offering of the leper, in order that a sin offering will not be of superior quality. Rabbi Tarfon says, all the remembrances that are in the Torah are [recorded] for good except for that which says (Num. 5:15), \"[the meal offering of jealousy] is meal offering of remembrance, recalling iniquity.\" Rabbi Akiva says, even this is for good, as it is said (Num. 5:28), \"And if the woman has not defiled herself, and she is pure, she will be cleansed and will be able to bear seed.\""

            "He (i.e., the Kohen) would take her scroll [on which the Sotah's oath would be written] and bring it into the <i>Ulam</i>. A golden tablet [containing the fixed language of the oath  (Num. 5:19-22)] was lodged within the wall of the <i>Heichal</i>, and it was visible from the <i>Ulam</i>. From that he looks and he writes [onto the scroll]. He neither shortens nor lengthens. He goes out and stands at the side of the Sotah. He reads and expounds and is punctilious on all the details of the <i>parashah</i>. And [the oath] may be pronounced in any language that she can hear (i.e., understand), in order that she knows on what account she would be drinking [the bitter waters], and about what (במה not כמה) she would be drinking, on what account she became defiled, and about what she became defiled. And he says to her, \"I adjure you and it will befall you.\" \"And this will befall you\" -- this is the curse. \"I adjure you\" -- this is the oath. § Rabbi Meir says, [when she responds <i>amen</i>, <i> amen</i> (see Sot. 2:5), she is responding] \"<i>amen</i> that I was not defiled,\" and \"<i>amen</i> that I will not become defiled.\" It is not that the [bitter] waters [necessarily] inspect her immediately (see Sot. 5:1); rather, even if she becomes corrupted twenty years later, the waters will expose her [corruption], as it is said (Num. 5:15), \"[the meal offering of jealousy] is a meal offering of remembrance, recalling iniquity.\" § [Returning to the order of the ritual,] [the Kohen] enters and writes [the oath], [then] goes out and erases it.  ",
            "[If] before the scroll is erased, she said, \"I will not drink,\" or she said, \"I am defiled,\" or if witnesses came [and testified] that she is defiled, the [bitter] waters are poured out and they possess no holiness, and her scroll is hidden away beneath the hinges of [an entrance to] the <i>Heichal</i>, and her meal offering is scattered around. [Similarly, if] the scroll is erased [and then] she said, \"I am defiled,\" the waters are poured out and they possess no holiness, and her scroll is hidden away beneath the hinges of the <i>Heichal</i>, and her meal offering is scattered on the ash heap, and her scroll is not valid to be drunk by another Sotah. ",
            "[If] the scroll is erased  and [then] she said, \"I will not drink,\" they pour it into her and make her drink it against her will. Rabbi Yehuda says, with iron tongs they open the mouth of that one and pour it into her and make her drink it against her will. Rabbi Akiva said to him, and if so, why would they make that one drink it, if not to check her? For behold, she [already] has been checked and been disgraced [by virtue of her refusal]. Rather, she is actually permitted to repent up until when her meal offering is offered up. [But once] her meal offering is offered up, and she said \"I will not drink,\" they pour it into her and make her drink it against her will.",
            "Rabbi Elazar says says, two jealousies are spoken of in the <i>parashah</i> of jealousy: One jealousy is the jealousy that she arouses in husband, and one is the jealousy that she arouses in the Place (i.e., God). Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says in the name of Rabbi Meir, what does the verse come to teach (Num. 5:22), \"And the woman says, <i>amen</i>, <i>amen</i>.\" [It teaches that] she was fit to have Divine retribution befall her in abundance from that which she brought upon herself from these [alleged transgressions], which caused her to be brought to an uncertain [status].  But rather, [if she has spoken truly (\"amen\"),] then she shall be released from her disgrace (שניקתה בניוולה, see Jastrow), as it is said (Num. 5:28), \"And she will be cleansed\" -- cleansed from all Divine punishments that would have been fit to befall her. Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer ben Teima, what does the verse come to teach (<i>ibid.</i>), \"And if she was not defiled\"? That if she had [previously] given birth in pain, she will [now] give birth with ease; [if she had given birth] to females, she will give birth to males; [if] to ugly children, she will give birth to beautiful children; [if to] short children, she will give birth to tall children; [if] one at a time, she will give birth two at a time.",
            "[The Mishnah (Sot. 3:4) states, Rabbi Yehoshua used to say, a foolish pious man, a sly wicked man, a female <i>perusha</i>, and the blows of the <i>perushim</i>, behold, they destroy the world. The Tosefta adds:] A child that outgrows his months (i.e., is younger than he appears) -- behold, he destroys the world. § For each and every act of intercourse in which her husband engaged with her [after he had warned her], behold, he is liable for it.",
            "If her meal-offering contracted impurity before it was consecrated in the [earthenware] vessel (Num. 5:18), behold, it is like any meal-offering [that became defiled]: It can be redeemed and eaten. [But if it contracted impurity] after it was consecrated in the vessel, its form is allowed to decay and it is taken out to the place of burning.<sup>*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. Sot. 3:6, omitting \"its form is allowed to decay,\" a phrase typically associated with disqualified animal sacrifices (see, e.g.,  Pes. 7:9, Shek. 7:3, Tos. Pesachim 4:1, Tos. Pesachim 6:6).</i> [If] she consecrated her meal-offering but there was not enough time [for the Kohen] to consecrate the handful [of the meal-offering] (Num. 5:26) before her husband dies, or before she herself dies, the remainders are forbidden, because from the beginning it came from a matter of doubt (i.e., whether adultery had occurred), and it atoned for its doubt and left.<sup>*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Sot. 9:7, using identical language in connection with the heifer whose neck is broken.</i> [If] witnesses came [and testified] that she was defiled, whether in this case or in that case, her meal-offering is forbidden. [If] it turns out that they were conspiring witnesses, whether in this case or in that case, her meal-offering [reverts to being] unconsecrated.",
            "[The Mishnah, Sot. 3:6, states, \"And [as to] all those married to Kohanim, their meal-offerings are burnt.\" The Tosefta comments:] [As to] all those married to a Kohen, whether she is a Kohen, whether she is a Levite, whether she is an Israelite, her meal-offering is not eaten, because there is a \"partnership\" in it (i.e., her husband, the Kohen, has a share in it, and a Kohen's meal-offering is never eaten (Lev. 6:16)). But [by the same token,] the entire [meal-offering] is not offered upon the fire [at once] because there is a partnership in it. <i>How so?</i> He consecrates the handful by itself, and he consecrates the remainders by themselves. Rabbi Elazar son of Rabbi Shimon says, he consecrates the handful by itself, and the remainders he scatters.",
            "A [male] Kohen stands and sacrifices on the Altar, which is not the case with a female Kohen. A man has authority over his daughter [with regard to] her betrothal, with money, with a document, or with relations, and [also] has authority over things she has found, and to the work of her hands (i.e., her earnings), and to the nullification of her vows (see Ket. 4:4), which is not the case with a woman. A man is liable for transgressing time-bound positive commandments, which is not the case with a woman. A man is liable  for transgressing the prohibitions against rounding [the corners of the head] and destroying [the corners of the beard] (Lev. 19:27), and against [a Kohen] contracting ritual impurity from a corpse (Lev. 21:1), which is not the case with a woman. A man is subject to the laws of the \"wayward and rebellious son\" (Deut. 21:18), but a woman is not subject to the laws of the wayward and rebellious son. A man [experiencing signs of leprosy] is subject to the laws of covering (Lev. 13:45) and shaving (Lev. 13:33), while a woman is subject to the laws of covering but not shaving. A man may be sold [as a slave] a second time, but a woman may not be sold a second time. A man may be sold a Hebrew slave, but a woman may not be sold a Hebrew slave. A man may have his ear bored (Ex. 21:6), but a woman may not have her ear bored. A man may acquire a Hebrew slave, but a woman may not acquire a Hebrew slave."

            "Rabbi Meir would say, from where is it derived that can you say that, \"With the [same] measure that a person measures others, they measure him\"? As it is said (Is. 27:8), \"In full measure (<i>b'sa'seah</i>) when You send her away do You contend with her\" (Steinsaltz tr.). [From this] I only have that one who measures with a seah (<i>b'seah</i>) [is also measured by a seah].<sup>*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It would thus seem that only the greatest transgressions (i.e., those compared to a \"seah,\" a very large quantity) are punished in equal measure.</i> From where is it derived that [the same applies to] one who measures with [smaller measures, such as] a half-kav<sup>*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">there are four kavs to a seah</i>, two kavs (<i>tarkav</i>), a quarter-kav, and half of a quarter-kav, an eighth-kav (<i>toman</i>), and one thirty-second of a kav (<i>ukla</i>)? The verse states (Is. 9:4), \"For all <i>se'on</i> He tramples with fierceness\"<sup>*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">literally, \"For all the boots that trample loudly\"; the word for \"boots\" (<i>so'en</i>) may be midrashically rendered as \"a small fraction of a seah,\" see Sot. 8b:16</i> -- behold, here there are many measures and many calculations. [From this] I only have things that come with a set measure. From where is it derived that even small droplets (<i>perutot</i>; alt., \"small coins\") can combine into a large calculation? The verse states (Ecc. 7:27, Steinsaltz tr.), \"[Behold, this have I found, says Koheleth, adding] one thing to another, to find out the account.” And thus you find with a Sotah that with the [same] measurement that she measured, she is measured with it. She stood in front of him in order that she appear pleasing before him; therefore, the Kohen stands her before everyone to display herself in disgrace, as it is said (Num. 5:18), \"And the Kohen stands the woman before God [and lets loose (the hair of) the woman's head], etc.\" [Similarly,] she spread out her shawl before him; therefore, the Kohen removes the scarf from her head and places it under her feet.  She plaited her hair to please him; therefore, the Kohen loosens [her hair]. She adorned her face for him; therefore, her face turns green [after drinking the bitter waters]. She painted her eyelids for him; therefore, her eyes bulge out [after drinking]. She beckoned to him with her finger; therefore, her fingernails fall off. She exposed her flesh for him; therefore, the Kohen rends her cloak and exposes her disgrace to the masses. She girded herself inside [her clothes]; therefore, the Kohen brings an Egyptian rope and ties it above her breasts, and anyone who wants to see comes and sees. She opened her thighs for him; therefore, her thigh wastes away [after drinking]. She received him on her stomach; therefore, her stomach distends. She fed him delicacies; therefore, her grain offering (i.e., barley, see Num. 5:15) is animal fodder. She gave him wine to drink in the finest cups; therefore, the Kohen makes her drink the bitter waters from a broken fragment (<i>makida</i>) of an earthenware vessel. She acted in secret (<i>seter</i>), as it is said (Job 24:15), \"The eye of the adulterer awaits the evening twilight, saying ['No one will cast an eye on me'...],\" [but] she was not aware that He Who sits in His concealment of eternity was turning His face toward her, as it is said (ibid.), \"and He places a mask (<i>seter</i>) on His face.\" Another version: It teaches that the Place exposes her concealment to the public, as it is said (Prov. 26:26), \"He covers his hatred with deceit, [and thus] his wickedness shall be exposed in public.\"",
            "The people of the [generation of] the Flood became haughty in front of the Place only due to the goodness that He showered upon them, as it says (Job 21:9-11): \"Their homes are secure, without fear [and they do not feel the rod of God]. Their bull breeds and does not fail ... They let their infants run loose like sheep, etc.\"  This was the cause of their [downfall]. And they said to God (Job 21:14-15): \"Leave us alone ... What is Shaddai that we should serve Him?\" They said, \"Why does He trouble Himself with us? All we need are two drops of water. Behold, ours are the rivers and the springs with which we supply ourselves on hot summer days and on rainy days, as it is said (Gen 2:6), \"But a surge would well up from the earth [and water all the face of the ground].\" The Place said to them, \"It was with goodness that I bestowed [all this] on you, and you come with haughtiness before me? I am coming to destroy you,\" as it is said (Gen. 6:17), \"As for me, here, I am about to bring on the Deluge, water upon the earth, etc.\" Rabbi Yosei ben Dormaskit says, the people of the [generation of] the Flood became haughty in front of the Place only with the sphere (<i>galgal</i>) of the eye, which resembles water, as it says (Gen. 6:2), \"And the <i>b'nei ha'elohim</i> (\"the sons of the judges/nobles\"; alt., \"the sons of the divine beings\")   saw how beautiful the daughters of men were, etc.\" In the same way, the Holy One Blessed be He did not destroy them with anything but a gathering (<i>galgal</i>) of waters, which resembles the eye, as it is is said (Gen. 7:11), \"On that day, all the fountains of the great deep burst apart [and the floodgates of the sky broke open].\" (Note: Tanakh translations generally follow JPS.)",
            "The people of the Tower [of Babel] became haughty in front of the Place only due to the goodness He showered upon them, as it says (Gen. 10:1-2, JPS Tr.), \"Everyone on earth had the same language and the same words, and as they migrated from the east [they came upon a valley in the land of Shinar and settled (lit., 'sat') there].\" And there is no \"sitting\" that does not involve eating and drinking, as it says (Ex. 32:6), \"And the people sat to eat and drink etc.\" This was the cause of their [downfall]. And they said (Gen. 11:4), \"Come let us build a city and a tower, etc.\" What does it say, but that \"The Lord scattered them [over the face of the whole earth]\" (Gen. 11:7).  The people of Sodom became haughty in front of the Place only due to the goodness He showered upon them, as it says: \"A land from which bread had issued forth — its place was overturned, as if (consumed by) fire. A place of sapphire were its stones, and dusts of gold were there. (And now it is) a path unknown (i.e., unfrequented) by brigands, and unseen by the falcon's eye, untrodden by the haughty (beasts) and not crossed by the lion (Job 28:5-8). The people of Sodom [said]: \"Since food comes out of our land, and silver and gold, and precious stones and pearls [all come] from our land, we have no need that other people will come to us to diminish [our valuables]. Let us rise and prevent the wayfarers to enter our cities [banot]!\" The Holy One of Blessing said to them: \"I gave goodness to you, and you seek to forget the wayfarers from your cities?! I will forget the wayfarers in your midst [beinechem] and I will forget you from the world!\" What does it say? \"He breaks open a shaft away from where men sojourn; they are forgotten of the foot that pass by; they hang afar from men, they swing to and fro.\" (Job 28:4) and \"The tents of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure, in whatsoever God brings into their hand.\" (Job 12:6) and so it says \"As I live—declares the Lord GOD—your sister Sodom and her daughters did not do what you and your daughters did.Only this was the sin of your sister Sodom: arrogance! She and her daughters had plenty of bread\"(Ezekiel 16:48-49). Egypt became haughty in front of the Place Blessed be He only due to water, as it says (Ex. 1:22, JPS Tr.), \"Then Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, “Every boy that is born [you shall throw into the Nile, but let every girl live].\" In the same way, the Place Blessed e He only destroyed them with water, as it says (Ex. 15:4, JPS Tr.), \"Pharaoh's chariots and his army He has cast into the sea.\" Sisera became haughty in front of the Place only due to legionnaires who did not receive wages (Judges 5:19, JPS Tr.), \"Then the kings came, they fought [... and they got no spoil of silver].\" And [when Yael entered the tent to kill him, the legionnaires] did not move from their places and they paid him no mind because he himself was merely a common soldier (see Jastrow, סָפַן).",
            "Samson transgressed with his eyes (Sot. 1:8), as it is said (Jud. 14:3), \"And Samson said to his father, 'Take her (i.e., the Philistine woman of Timnah) for me because she is pleasing to my eyes,'\" and thus he was punished with his eyes, as it is said (Jud. 16:21), \"And the Philistines seized him and gouged out his eyes, etc.\" Rebbi says, he started going astray in Gaza, and thus his punishment happened nowhere but Gaza itself. Absalom transgressed with his hair, as it is said (2 Sam. 14:25), \"And there was no man so beautiful as Absalom [in all of Israel; from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head, he had no defect].\" Therefore, he was punished with his hair (2 Sam. 18:9). Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi says, Absalom was an eternal nazirite, yet every twelve months he would shave his head (2 Sam. 14:26). [From where is it derived that he was an \"eternal nazirite\"<sup>*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., and thus forbidden from cutting his hair even once every twelve months</i>?] As it is said (2 Sam. 15:7-8): \"After 40 years had passed, Absalom said to the king, 'Let me go [and I will fulfill my vow, which I vowed to the Lord in Hebron]. For your servant made a vow  [when I lived in Geshur of Aram, saying, 'If the Lord ever returns me to Jerusalem, I will worship the Lord.'].\"<sup>*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The implication is that the \"vow\" Absalom referred to was a nazirite vow.</i> Rabbi Nehorai says, he would shave his head once ever thirty days, as it is said (2 Sam. 14:26), \"And it was at the end of <i>each period of days</i> (יָמִ֤ים לַיָּמִים֙), etc., and the weight of [Absalom's] hair of his head was two hundred shekels by the king's weight.\"<sup>*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rebbi and Rabbi Nehorai interpret the ambiguous phrase \"each period of days\" differently; Rebbi as denoting a year, and Rabbi Nehorai as a month. Note that the following passage, from \"Rabbi Yosei says\" to \"Sabbath Eve,\" does not appear in the present text but appears in printed editions, supported by Lieberman.</i> Rabbi Yosei says, he would shave every Sabbath Eve, for it is the custom of the sons of kings to shave from Sabbath Eve to Sabbath Eve. [Rabbi Shimon says<sup>*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Per GR\"A</i>,] like it says about kohanim (Ez. 44:20), \"Their heads they shall not shave, and their locks they shall not grow out; [rather,] they shall trim their heads.\"  [On the subject of shaving from Sabbath Eve to Sabbath Eve (see Lieberman),] it is not the custom of the people of Tiberius and the people of Tzipporin to shave in this way. [Returning to the discussion of Absalom,] he engaged in relations with ten concubines of his father, and therefore ten spears were thrust into him, as it is said (2 Sam. 18:15), \"And ten young men [who carried Joab's armor circled around and struck Absalom, and killed him].\" And because he engaged in three acts of theft -- [stealing] the heart of his father, and the heart of the Beit Din, and the heart of all of Israel -- therefore three spears were driven into his heart, as it is said (2 Sam. 18:14), \"And [Joab] took three spears in his hand [and drove them into the heart of Absalom].\"",
            "Sennacherib became haughty in front of the Place only due to an emissary<sup>*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew word <b>מלאך</b> (emissary) can refer to either an emissary of man (a messenger) or an emissary of God (an angel); both senses are employed below.</i>, as it is said (2 Kings 19:23-24), \"Through your emissaries (מַלְאָכֶ֘יךָ֮) you taunted the Lord, etc., [saying,] 'I have bore (i.e., dug for water) and I have drunk strange waters [and the soles of my feet have dried up all the canals of Metzor].\" Therefore the Holy One, Blessed be He, did not destroy him with anything but an emissary, as it is said (2 Kings 19:35), \"And it happened on that night, that an emissary (מַלְאַ֣ךְ) of the Lord went out and slew the Assyrian camp, etc.\" And all of them (i.e., the slain) were kings with crowns affixed to their heads. ",
            "Nebuchadnezzar said, the inhabitants of the earth are unworthy of my dwelling among them. I will make myself a little cloud and I will dwell within it, as it is said (Is. 14:14, Koren tr.), \"I will ascend above the heights of the cloud[, I will be like the Most High].\" The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to him (Is. 14:13), \"And you said in your heart, 'I will ascend to Heaven; higher than the stars of God I will raise up my throne, etc.'\" [Therefore] I am coming to bring you down to the pit of destruction (cf. Ps. 55:24). What does it say, but (Is. 14:15), \"Even unto the underworld (She'ol) will you descend[, to the bottom of the pit].\" You said, the inhabitants of the earth are unworthy of my dwelling among them; [therefore it is stated] (Dan. 4:25-30), \"You shall be driven from men[, and with the beasts of the field shall you dwell, etc.],\" \"That very hour [His] word was fulfilled as to Nebuchadnezzar, and he was driven from men,\" [and] \"All this came upon Nebuchadnezzar the king / At the end of twelve months...\""

            "[Thus far,] I have only derived that Divine punishment is meted out measure-for-measure, such that a person is measured (i.e., punished) according to the same measure that the person himself measures (i.e., sins). From where can you derive that the measure of Divine beneficence is five hundred times greater than the measure of Divine punishment (i.e., a good deed is rewarded five hundredfold)? [As to Divine punishment,] As it is written (Ex. 20:5), \"[calling into account] the sins of the father upon the sons until the third and until the fourth of those who hate me.\" As to the measure of Divine beneficence, it is written (ibid.) \"showing lovingkindness to thousands \"<sup>*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The traditional vowel markers for the word <b>אלפים</b> yields <i>alaphim</i> (\"thousands\"); however, the same letters can also yield <i>alpayim</i> (\"two thousand), i.e., five hundred times four.</i> You must say [therefore] that the measurement of Devine beneficence is greater than the measure of Divine punishment by [a factor of] one to five hundred. And similarly you find regarding Abraham, that with the measurement that he measured, he was measured. Abraham \"ran\" (i.e., acted with alacrity) before the ministering angels on three occasions, as it is said (Gen. 18:2), \"And he saw [them] and he ran to meet them, etc.\"; and (Gen 18:6) \"And Abraham hastened into his tent, to Sarah, etc.\"; and (Gen. 18:7), \"And to the flocks ran Abraham [and he took a young ox], etc.\" Thus, so too the Holy One, Blessed be He, \"ran\" before his descendants on three occasions, as it is said (Deut. 33:2), \"Hashem <i>came</i> from Sinai and He <i>shone forth</i> from Sei'r for them; He <i>sent out beams</i> from Mount Paran, etc.\" Regarding Abraham it says, \"he bowed down to the earth,\" so too the Holy One, Blessed be He, [did so] with Israel his descendants in the future, as it is said (Is. 49:23), \"And kings will tend to your children, and their queens shall serve you as nurses; [They shall bow to you, face to the ground], etc.\" Regarding Abraham it says (Gen. 18:4, Fox tr.), \"Pray let a little water be fetched,\" so too the Holy One, Blessed be He, [did so] with Israel, and he gave to [Abraham's] descendants a well in the desert [whose water] flowed in abundance for the entire camp, as it is said (Num. 21:17-18, Fox tr.), \"[And Israel sang this song: Spring up, O well ...] The well that was dug out by princes! That was excavated by people's nobles!\" It comes to teach that [the water] traveled over the entire face of the south, and irrigated the entire face of the wasteland, as it is said (Num. 21:20), \"It overlooks the face of the wasteland.\" Regarding Abraham, it says (Gen. 18:4), \"... and recline under the tree,\" so too the Holy One, Blessed be He gave to his descendants seven clouds of glory in the desert: One on their right, and one on their left, and one in front of them, and one behind them, and one above their heads, and one to the <i>Shekhinah</i> that was among them, and a pillar of cloud that was [placed] as an advance guard before them, killing snakes and scorpions and burning thorns and thistles and brambles [in their path]. He lowered for them the high places, and raised for them the low places, and made for them a straight pathway, and continually drew for them a marked pathway, as it is said (Num. 10:33), \"And Hashem travels with the Ark of the Covenant before you, etc., \" And it was in [that cloud] that they would serve Him all forty years that they were in the desert, as it is said (Num. 10:34), \"And the cloud of Hashem was over them by day [in their journey from the camp].\" What does it come to teach (Ex. 13:22), \"The column of cloud would not depart by day[, nor the column of fire by night]\"? That the column of the day would overlap with the column of night, and the column of night would overlap with the column of the day. Regarding Abraham, it says (Gen. 18:5), \"And I will bring you a loaf of bread so that your hearts may be strengthened, etc.\" So too the Holy One, Blessed be He gave manna to his descendants in the desert, as it is said (Num. 11:8), \"The people would go to and fro and collect it, etc., [and its taste was that of] a dainty (<i>lashad</i>) prepared with oil.\" The manna can be likened to a breast (<i>dad</i>):<sup>*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It appears that <b>דד</b> (<i>dad</i>), as used here, is a euphemistic alteration of <b>שד</b> (<i>shad</i>), both meaning \"breast,\" the word <b>שד</b> contained within <b>לשד</b> (<i>lashad</i>, i.e., \"dainty\"), and thus midrashically expounded with the former meaning.</i> Just as a breast is the most important thing for a baby, and everything [else] is secondary, so too the manna was the most important thing for Israel, and everything [else] was secondary to them. Another version: Just as a breast is such that even if a baby suckles from it the entire day it does not harm him, so too the manna was made such that even if [the Children of] Israel and of it the whole day, it would not harm them. But [unlike milk], whoever directed his thoughts toward [the manna], it would change itself inside his mouth to whatever taste that he desired, as it is said (Ps. 106:15), \"He gave them what they asked for,\" [and] (Ps. 78:29), \"He gave them what they craved.\" And not only that, but two thousand years' [worth] of food descended upon them in a single day. Regarding Abraham, it says (Gen. 18:7), \"And to the flocks ran Abraham [and he took a young ox], etc.\" So too, the Holy One, Blessed be He swept in quail for his descendants from the sea, as it is said (Num. 11:31), \"And a wind blew out from Hashem, and swept in quail from the sea, etc.\" [The quail were stacked] two cubits above the ground, the words of Rabbi Akiva (see ibid.). Rabbi Elazar the son of Rabbi Yosei HaGalili says [regarding the verse (ibid., Fox tr.)], \"they spread out over the camp as far as a day's journey here [and a day's journey here],\" what does it come to teach by repeating \"and a day's journey here\"? It teaches that [the quail] would ascend from the ground up until the firmament, and cover up the orb of the sun. And what does it mean (ibid.), \"about two cubits on the face of the earth\"? Two cubits were removed from the earth, so that one would not [even] need to trouble oneself to stoop down [in order to] take them away. Regarding Abraham, what does it say, but (Gen. 18:17), \"And he stood over them [under the tree, and they ate].\" So too the Holy One, Blessed be He, protected his descendants in Egypt, as it is said (Ex. 12:23), \"And Hashem passed over the entrances, etc.\" With Abraham, what does it say, but (Gen. 18:17), \"And Abraham went with them, to escort them.\" So too, the Holy One, Blessed be He, attached himself to his descendants for forty years, as it is said, \"These forty years, Hashem your God is with you, etc.\"",
            "Joseph merited the bones of his father (Gen. 50:7); so too, none other than Moses occupied himself with [Joseph's bones], as it is said (Ex. 13:19), \"And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him.\" It teaches that the entire nation was occupying itself with [gathering] spoils, and he was occupying himself with [fulfilling] a mitzvah, as it is said (Prov. 10:8), \"The wise-hearted accepts mitzvot, etc.\" [But] if Moses had not occupied himself with with it, would [the Children of] Israel not have occupied themselves with it? What does it say, but (Josh. 24:32), \"And the bones of Joseph that the <i>Children of Israel</i> had brought up from Egypt, were buried in Shechem.\" Rather, as soon as as Israel saw Moses occupying himself with it, they said, \"Leave it, for the honor of the great ones is more than that of the small ones\" (i.e., it is a greater honor for Joseph's bones to be carried by Moses than by us; see Sot. 13a:11). And if Moses and [the Children of] Israel had not occupied themselves with it, would his own children not have occupied themselves with it? What does the verse say, but (Josh. 24:32),  \"and [the bones of Joseph] became a heritage for the <i>children of Joseph</i>.\" Rather, as soon as his children saw that Moses and Israel were occupying themselves with it, they said, \"Leave it, for the honor of the multitudes is more than that of the few.\"",
            "How did Moses know where Joseph had been buried? They said: Serakh daughter, of Asher was of the same generation, and she went and said to Moses: \"In the Nile River, Joseph is buried. And the Egyptians made for him metal skewers and affixed them with wood.\" Moses went and stood at the Nile River and said, \"Joseph, the time has come for the Holy Blessed One to redeem Israel. Behold, the Shekhina is delayed for you, and the Israelites are delayed for you, and the clouds of glory are delayed for you. If you reveal yourself, good (okay!), and if not, we are cleansed of the oath which you have sworn upon our fathers.\" Then the coffin of Joseph floated to the surface and Moses took hold of it and went. And you should not wonder at this, for behold, it says (2 Kings  6:5), \"And as one of [the disciples of the prophets accompanying Elisha] was chopping down a tree-trunk, the iron [axe head] fell into the water, etc., and the man of God said, 'Where did it fall?' and he showed him the place, and he cut off a stick and threw it there, and the iron [axe head] floated up.\" And behold, these matters are a <i>kal v'chomer</i> (a logical deduction): If Elisha, who was a disciple of Elijah, who was a disciple of Moses, could make iron float, then how much more so could Moses, who was the master of Elijah, who was the master of Elisha, [bring up the coffin of Joseph]! There are those who say that Joseph was buried in the crypt of the kings, and Moses went and stood above the crypt and said, \"Joseph! Joseph! The time has arrived for the Holy One, Blessed be He, to redeem Israel. Behold, the <i>Shekhinah</i> awaits you, and Israel awaits you, and the Clouds of Glory awaits you. If you reveal yourself it would be well, and if not, we will be free (lit., \"clean\") of the vow that our fathers vowed.\" Immediately, the coffin (<i>aron</i>) of Joseph stirred, and Moses took it and carried it off. And there were two <i>aronot</i><sup>*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word <i>aron</i> (<b>ארון</b>) means both \"coffin/casket\" and \"ark/chest\"; both senses will be employed here.</i> traveling together: The <i>aron kodesh</i> (the Holy Ark), and the <i>aron shel met</i> (the \"ark\" of the dead). And all the passersby would say, What is the nature of these two <i>aronot</i>? They said to them, one is the Holy Ark and one is the ark of the dead. They said to them, And how is it possible for the Holy Ark to travel alongside an ark of the dead? They said to them, the dead who is in this ark fulfills what is written in that which rests in that Holy Ark.",
            "Moses merited the bones [of Joseph]; so too, none other than the Holy One, Blessed be He occupied himself with [Moses's bones], as it is said (Deut. 34:6), \"And He buried him the the valley, etc.\" It teaches that he was carried by the body of the <i>Shekhinah</i> approximately four <i>mils</i>, from the portion of Reuben to the portion of Gad. [From where is it derived] that he died within the field of Reuben? As it is said (Num. 32:37), \"And the children of Reuben built [Cheshbon<sup>*</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>חֶשְׁבּוֹן</b> (Cheshbon) can also mean \"a reckoning,\" as in the legal phrase <b>\"דִּין וְחֶשְׁבּוֹן\"</b> (<i>din v'cheshbon</i>), \"an account and a reckoning,\" and thus may be midrashically associated with Moses the lawgiver; see also Bekh. 5a:12 (\"Moses our teacher was ... an expert in reckoning (<b>חשבונות</b>). Alternatively, per the expanded text of MS Erfurt, the derivation is from the fact that Moses is recorded as dying on Mount Nebo (Deut. 34:1), which is then associated with Num. 32:38, \"And the children of Reuben built ... Nebo, etc.,\" accord. Lieberman, Minchat Yitzchak.</i>], etc.\" And from where is it derived that he was buried within the field of the inheritance of Gad? As it is said (Deut. 33:20-21), \"And to Gad he said, Blessed is he that enlarges Gad... And he selected the first part for himself, because there the portion of a lawgiver (i.e., Moses) was reserved.\" And the ministering angels eulogized and said before him (Deut. 33:21), \"The justice of Hashem did he perform, and His laws with Israel.\" And thus it says regarding a suspected adulteress (Num. 5:22), \"And may these bitter waters enter [into your intestines, to cause the belly to swell and the thigh to fall, etc.].\" The thigh is the place where the transgression was initiated, [and thus] the Divine retribution begins there, and afterwards the belly, as it is said (Num. 5:27), \"And when he gives her the waters to drink... [her belly shall swell and her thigh shall fall].\"<sup>*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Note that Num. 5:21, in which \"thigh\" precedes \"belly,\" may be the intended reference (see Bam. Rabbah 9:23, Sifrei Zuta 5:21:5).</i> And so too you find with the people of [the generation of] the Flood: Man was the initiator of transgression, as it is said (Gen. 6:5), \"And God saw how great was the wickedness of Man on earth, etc.,\" and thus Man was stricken first, but the remainder did not escape, as it is said (Gen. 7:23), \"And everything in existence was blotted out, [from Man, to cattle, to creeping things, and to the flying creatures, etc.]\" [Similarly,] the residents of Sodom were the initiators of the transgression, as it is said (Gen. 19:4), \"They (i.e., Lot and the two Divine emissaries) had not yet laid down when the men of the city [... encircled the house, etc.],\" and thus they were stricken first, but the remainder did not escape, as it is said (Gen. 19:11 (Fox tr.)), \"while the men who were at the entrance to the house[, they struck with dazzling-light—[all men] <i>great and small</i>].\" The most powerful of Egypt -- they were the initiators of the transgression, as it is said (Ex. 1:22), \"And Pharaoh commanded all his people saying, 'Every son [that is born shall be thrown into the River].'\" [And as a result,] they were stricken first, but the remainder did not escape, as it is said (Ex. 7:29), \"Onto you, and onto your people[, and onto all your servants will the frogs rise up].\" The spies -- they were the initiators of the transgression, as it is said (Num. 13:32), \"And they delivered an evil report of the Land that they had spied out, etc.\" [And as a result,] they were stricken first, but the remainder did not escape, as it is said (Num. 14:37), \"And those men who delivered an evil report of the Land died,\" but the remainder did not escape, as it is said (Num. 14:35), \"I am God, I have spoken if I will not do thusly [to the whole evil congregation].\" The dwellers of the Land of Israel were the initiators of the transgression, as it is said (Jer. 12:14), \"Thus says the Lord of Host regarding all the evil dwellers who lay a hand on the inheritance [of My people Israel], etc.\" Thus, so too they were stricken first, but the remainder did not escape, as it is said (<i>ibid.</i>), \"I will uproot them from their lands, etc.\" The prophets of Jerusalem -- they were the initiators of the transgression, as it is said (Jer. 23:15, JPS tr.), \"For from the prophets of Jerusalem, Godlessness has gone forth to the whole land.\" Thus, so too were they stricken first, but the remainder did not escape, as it is said (Jer. 29:22), \"And there will be taken from [the false prophets Ahab and Zedekiah] a curse [extending] to all the exiles of Judah that are in Babylon, etc.\"",
            "Just as she is forbidden to her husband, so too is she forbidden to her paramour (Sot. 5:1). Therefore, it is said regarding a suspected adulteress, that she cast her eyes on what was not fit for her, [and as a result] that which she sought was not given to her, and that which was in her hands was taken from her. And so too you find with the primeval snake, that it was craftier than all the animals and all the beasts of the field, as it is said (Gen. 3:1), \"And the snake was craftier than all [the beasts], etc.\" It sought to kill Adam and marry Eve. The Place said to it, I said, you will be the king of all the animals and beasts, and now, since you did not desire that, you will be more accursed than all the animals and all the beasts of the field. I said, you will walk tall and upright, like a man. Now, since you did not desire that, \"on your belly you will crawl\" (Gen. 3:14). I said, you will eat from the food of man, and drink from the drink of man. Now, since you did not desire that, \"and dust you shall eat all the days of your life\" (ibid.). You sought to kill Adam and marry Eve. Now, \"and enmity I will place between you and the woman\" (Gen. 3:15). Thus, that which it sought was not given to it, and that which was in its hand was taken from it, and so too you find with Cain, Korach, and Bilaam, and Doeg, and Ahitophel, and Gahazi, and Absalom, and Adonijah, and Haman, that they cast their eyes on what was not fit for them. That which they sought was not given to them, and that which was in their hands was taken from them. "

            "Rabbi Meir would say: Just as there are different attitudes in consumption of food, so are there different attitudes with regards to women. Some men, if a fly [merely] passes over his cup, he sets it aside and does not taste it. That [fly in the cup refers to] corrupted women, when he wishes to divorce his wife [but has not done it yet]. Some men, if a fly falls into his cup, he throws it out and does not drink it. And this is the trait of Papus ben Yehuda, who would lock [the door of the house] before his wife, and would leave. And there is a man where, if a fly falls in his cup, he throws [the fly] out and then drinks it. This is the trait of any man who sees her speak to her neighbors and relatives, and leaves her be. And there is a man where, if a fly falls into the plate, he crushes it and eats it. And this is the trait of a corrupted man who sees his wife go out with her head uncovered, her heart warmed for her servants and maidservants, and spins cloth in the marketplace, and [whose shirt is] open on both sides, and bathes and plays around with the men. This is the command from the Torah to divorce her, for it is stated [Deuteronomy 24:1-2] \"[When a man takes a wife, and marries her, then it comes to pass, if she find no favor in his eyes,] because he hath found some unseemly thing in her, [that he writes her a bill of divorce, and gives it in her hand,] and sends her out of his house... [and she departs out of his house, and goes and becomes another man's wife.]\" The text calls him 'another', implying that he is not of similar constitution to the first, [for] the first one sent her away because of sin, and the second came and was lenient toward her. If he merits, the heavens will cause him to send her away from his possession, and if not, she will ultimately bury him, as it says [Deuteronomy 24:2] \"or if the latter man dies.\" It is appropriate for this [type of] man dies, because of the woman he brought into his household.

She said, \"Lest he teach Isaac my son to do thus, and he will go and worship thus, thereby desecrating the Name of Heaven by such things.\" He said to her, \"After one bestows a benefit on a person, may he then disadvantage him (i.e., remove the benefit)? Thus, after we made her a queen, after we made her a lady, and brought her close to such greatness, shall we banish her from within our house? What will people say about us?

And why then does the verse say \"everything\"? It teaches that [God] was deciding a second time [between them], and [thus already] had decided a first time.

And it teaches about the second loaf of bread that it may impart impurity on the third loaf of bread. <i>How so?</i> An oven (תנור not תגור) of first-degree impurity [renders] a loaf of bread [inside it] with second-degree impurity, [and if that loaf] touches a loaf, [it imparts] third-degree impurity.

And why does it say \"one thousand cubits\" [in one verse], and why does it say \"two thousand <i>with a</i> cubit\" [in the next verse]? Rather, [it comes to teach], one thousand cubits for pastureland, and two thousand cubits for the Sabbath boundary. Rabbi Eliezer, the son of Rabbi Yosei HaGalili says, two thousand cubits is the boundary of the Levitical cities.

            "...Drashed Rabbi Akiva: At the time that Israel went up from the sea, they wanted to sing, and the Divine Spirit came to them and they sang.How?   They sang it like the Hallel HaGadol (Psalm 136) is sung in synagogues- the leader sings, and everyone else responds.  Moshe said \"I will sing to Adonai!\", and Israel responded \"I will sing to Adonai!\".  Moses said \"God is my strength and my salvation!\" and Israel responded, \"I will sing to Adonai!\".  Moses said \"Adonai is a Warrior!\" and Israel said \"I will sing to Adonai!\".   Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yosi HaGalili said: It's like a kid who reads the Hallel in a school- the leader says it, and the child responds afterwards with each and every word.  Moses said, \"I will sing to Adonai!\", and Israel said \"I will sing to Adonai!\".   Moses said \"God is my strength and my salvation!\" and Israel responded, \"God is my strength and my salvation!\", etc.   Rabbi Nechemiah said: It was like the way people read Sh'ma in synagogues, as it says, \"Thus sang Moshe and the Children of Israel, etc.\"- [It was that] Moshe opened with a phrase, and Israel answered after him and completed it with him.  Moshe said \"Thus sang...\" and Israel responded \"I will sing to Adonai, for God has triumphed gloriously!\".  Moshe said \"God is my strength and my salvation\" and Israel responded \"This is my God, Whom I will glorify!\" Moshe said, \"Adonai is a Warrior!\" and Israel said \"Adonai is God's Name!\" etc.",
            "Said Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai: There were four matters that Rabbi Akiva expounded upon [midrashically], but I prefer my own words to his. Rabbi Akiva expounded (Gen 21:9), \"And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian that she bore to Abraham <i>m'tzachek</i> (lit., 'laughing' or 'sporting').\" <i>Laughter</i> is not what is being spoken of here; rather, idol worship, as it is said [during the sin of the golden calf] (Ex. 32:6), \"And the people sat down to eat and drink, and [then] they arose to sport (<i>l'tzachek</i>).\" It teaches that our Matriarch Sarah saw Ishmael building high places and hunting for locusts, and offering it up and turning it into smoke for idol worship. Rabbi Eliezer, the son of Rabbi Yosei HaGalili says, laughter (<i>tzachok</i>) is not spoken of here; rather sexual immorality, as it is said [in the matter of Potiphar's wife] (Gen 39:17), \"The [Hebrew] servant came to me, etc., to sport (<i>l'tzachek</i>) with me.\" It teaches that our Matriarch Sarah saw Ishmael trampling the gardens and afflicting the women. Rabbi Yishmael says, the word <i>tzachok</i> means nothing other than the spilling of blood, as it is said (2 Sam. 2:14-16), \"And Abner said to Joab, 'Let the young men arise and sport (<i>visachaku</i>) before us', etc. And they got up and they were counted by number, etc. And each man grabbed his neighbor by the head and [stuck] his sword into his neighbor's side, and they fell together.\" It teaches that our Matriarch Sarah was seeing Ishmael taking a bow and arrow and shooting them toward Isaac [as though in sport], as it is said (Prov. 26:19-20, JPS tr.), \"Like a madman scattering deadly firebrands, arrows, is one who cheats his fellow and says, 'I was only joking.'\" And I say, God forbid that there would be such things occurring in the house of this same tzaddik (i.e., Abraham)! Is it possible that the one for whom it is said (Gen. 18:19), \"For I have known him in order that he command [his sons and his household after him, that they shall heed the path of God, to perform righteousness and justice],\" that there would be idol worship, sexual immorality, and the spilling of blood in his household?! Rather, \"<i>tzachok</i>\" is only mentioned here in connection with inheritance, for from the time that our Patriarch Isaac was born to our Father Abraham, everyone was joyous, and they said, \"A son is born to Abraham! A son is born to Abraham!\" He had waited for so long, and he was given two portions. And Ishmael laughed to himself, and he said, \"Don't be foolish! Don't be foolish! I am the first-born and I will take both portions.\" Then, at the conclusion of the matter, you learn, as it is said (Gen. 21:10), \"for the son of this maidservant [shall not inherit with my son, with Isaac].\" And I prefer my words to the words of Rabbi Akiva."

That the Holy One Blessed be He fulfills that which he gives to the righteous with goodwill and with happiness, as it is said (Ex. 23:26), \"The number of your days I will complete.\" And from where is it derived that Moses died on the 7th of Adar?

If Saul was in Gibeah, then how could he be in Ramah, and if he was in Ramah, how could he be in Gibeah? Rather, it was the court of Samuel the Ramathite that made Saul's throne stable in Gibeah. Similarly, it says (Psalm 122:2), 'Our feet are standing in your gates, Jerusalem.' Can it really be said that our feet are only standing in the gates of Jerusalem? Rather, it is the courts of David that stand in the gates of Jerusalem. Similarly, it says (Zechariah 14:10), 'The whole land, from Geba to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem, will become like the Arabah.'

Rabbi Yehoshua ben Karcha says, [the reason is that] their betrothal was not fully valid, as it is said (2 Sam. 3:14), \"[And David sent messengers to Ish-boshet son of Saul, saying,] 'Give me my wife, Michal, for whom I paid the marriage-price [of one hundred Philistine foreskins].'\" Just as their betrothal was not fully valid, so too their marriage was not fully valid.

For was Jehoshaphat not king after him for five years (see 2 Kings 8:16)? Rather, as soon as Jehoshaphat king of Judah went with Ahab king of Israel to Ramot Gilead, a decree was instituted against Jehoshaphat to be killed, as it is said (1 Kings 22:32, JPS Tr.), \" And when the chariot officers saw Jehoshaphat [whom they took for the king of Israel, they turned upon him to attack him, and Jehoshaphat cried out].\" He was fit to be killed at that very moment; rather, it teaches that due to the merit of the cry that he cried out, the sentence was suspended for him seven years, and they were counted toward his son.",
            "[It is stated]: \"Jehoram was thirty-two years old in [the beginning of] his reign, and for eight years he was king in Jerusalem\" (2 Chr. 21:5). And regarding Ahaziah his son, what does it say, but (2 Chr. 22:2), \"Ahaziah was forty-two years old in [the beginning of] his reign, and for one year he was king in Jerusalem.\" And in another place it says (2 Kings 8:26), \"Ahaziah was twenty-two years old in [the beginning of] his reign.\" Said Rabbi Yosei: And how is it possible for a son to be two years (שתי שנים, see MS Vienna) older than his father? Rather, as soon as Asa king of Judah married the daughter of Omri king of Israel to Jehoshaphat his son, it was decreed on the kingship of [the House of] David, that it would terminated with the House of Ahab, as it is said (2 Chr. 22:7): \"And God brought about the downfall of Ahaziah [for visiting Joram, and during his visit, he went out with Jehoram to Jehu son of Nimsi, who God had anointed to cut off the House of Ahab.]\" And the two of them fell that same day -- the one with the other.",
            "And similarly [it says], \"All adduced their genealogies in the days of Yotham, king of Judah, and in the days of Yeravam, king of Israel\" (1 Chr. 5:17, JPS Tr.). Is it possible to say this? Did not Uzziah bury Yeravam, and another three kings after him? Rather, all of these twenty-five years that Uzziah ruled he was a leper (2 Chr. 26:21), \"and Yotham his son [ruled] over the house of the king [and] judged the people of the land.\"",
            "Before Elijah was taken away, the Holy Spirit was abundant among Israel, as it is said (2 Kings 2:2, JPS Tr.), \"Elijah said to Elisha, 'Stay here, for the Lord has sent me on to Bethel.'\" What does it say (2 Kings 2:3), \"The sons of the prophets at Bethel came out to Elisha, etc.\" [Then] what does it say (2 Kings 2:5-6), \"And the sons of the prophets who were in Jericho approached [Elisha], etc.\" [and Elijah said to Elisha], \"Because the Lord has sent me to the Jordan.\"  [Then] what does it say (2 Kings 2:7), \"And fifty men from the sons of the prophets went and stood across from him from afar and the two of them (Elijah and Elisha) stood by the Jordan.\" One might think that this was because they were few, and thus it comes to teach, \"And fifty men, etc.\" One might think that they were small (i.e., insignificant), and thus it comes to teach (2 Kings 2:5), \"And they said to him, 'Did you know that today Hashem is taking your master [from you]?'\" It does not say \"<i>our</i> master\"; rather, it says \"<i>your</i> master.\" It teaches that they were all friends of Elijah, and all of them had the same worth as Elijah. And from where is it derived that the Holy Spirit was removed from them? As it is said (2 Kings 2:16), \"And they said to him, 'Now, if you please, your servant has fifty valiant men. [They will go and search for your master, lest the Spirit of God has taken him away, and cast him onto one of the mountains, or into one of the valleys.]'\" Is it possible for a human being, the night before, to say \"Did you know that today Hashem is taking your master,\" and now they say, \"They will go and search for your master\"? Rather, it teaches that the Holy Spirit was hidden from them. \"And they pressed him until he was ashamed\" (2 Kings 2:17) -- what does \"until he was ashamed\" come to teach? It is as if to say that he was ashamed on account of them, lest they say that he did not wish to go and meet his master. As long as Elisha lived, the bands of Aramean raiders did not [cross] the border of Israel, as it says (2 Kings 6:23, JPS Tr.), \"And the Aramean bands stopped invading the land of Israel.\" Once Elisha died and they had buried him, the bands of Moabite [and Aramean] raiders invaded the land of Israel (see 2 Kings 24:2)."

            "Once the First Temple was built, the Tent of Meeting was hidden away, and hidden along with it were its boards, its clasps, and its bars, and its pillars, and its sockets. And nevertheless, they would only use the table [for the showbread] that Moses made, and the candelabra that Moses made. [The candelabra] did not require anointing oil, for the inaugural sanctification sanctified it for that [first] time, and also sanctified it for future eras.",
            "Once the Ark was hidden away, hidden with it was the jar of manna, and the flask of anointing oil, and the staff of Aaron [and] its almonds and its blossoms, and the chest that the Philistines sent as a gift to the God of Israel. All of these had been in the Holy of Holies in the Temple. And once the Ark was hidden away, its vessels were hidden [along] with it. And who hid it away? Josiah the king hid it away. What did he see [that caused him to hide it]? It was because he saw written in the Torah (Deut. 28:36), \"Hashem will drive away you and your king, etc.\" He appointed Levites and they hid it, as it is said (2 Chron. 35:3), \"He said to the Levites, who taught all of Israel, who were holy to Hashem: 'Put the Holy Ark in the Temple that Solomon, king of Israel, built. You need not carry it on your shoulders any longer.'\" He said to them, \"Hide it away, so that it not be taken up to Babylonia like the rest of the vessels, so that it may be restored to its place [in the future],\" as it is said (ibid.), \"Now serve Hashem your God, and His people Israel,\" [and thus] they immediately hid it away. Rabbi Eliezer says, [rather,] the Ark was exiled to Babylonia, as it is said (2 Kings 20:17), \"[Behold, days are coming when all that is in your house, and all the treasures that your fathers have stored up until today, will be carried away to Babylonia]; not a thing (<i>davar</i>) will remain, said Hashem.\" And there is no <i>davar</i> but the <i>dibrot</i> (i.e., the Commandments, see Avot D'Rabbi Natan 41:12) that are in it. Rabbi Shimon says, behold, it says (2 Chron. 36:10, JPS tr.), \"At the turn of the year, King Nebuchadnezzar sent to have him brought to Babylonia with the precious vessels of the House of the Lord [etc.]\" -- that is the Ark. Rabbi Yehudah ben Lakish says, the Ark was hidden in its place, as it is said (1 Kings 8:8), \"And the poles [of the Ark] projected out, [and the ends of the poles] were seen [from the sanctuary in front of the Holy, but they were not seen from the outside]; and they remain there until this day.\"",
            "Once the Holy Temple was destroyed, the kingship of the House of David ceased and the the Urim and Tummim ceased, and the [Levitical] cities with fields ceased to exist. As it is said (Ezra 2:63), \"And the Tisharta (i.e., the Persian governor of Judea) told them not to partake of the most holy things until a Kohen with the Urim and Tummim was installed.\" This can be likened to a person who says to his fellow, \"Until the dead are resurrected or until Elijah comes.\"",
            "From the time that the last prophets -- Chaggai, Zechariah, and Malachi -- died, the Holy Spirit ceased to exist among Israel. And nevertheless, they would avail themselves of the Divine Voice (<i>bat kol</i>, lit. \"Daughter of the Voice\"). It so happened that the Sages entered the upper chamber of Ben Guriya in Jericho, and a Divine Voice issued, and it said to them, \"There is a man here among you who is worthy of the Holy Spirit, only that his generation does not merit it.\" They cast their eyes on Hillel the Elder. And at the time of his death, they would say, \"Alas, humble one, alas, righteous one, disciple of Ezra.\"",
            "It once happened that the Sages had arrived in Yavneh and a Divine Voice went out and it said to them, \"There is here a man who is worthy of the Holy Spirit, but his generation does not merit it.\" They cast their eyes on Hillel the Elder. And when he died, they said, \"Alas, humble one, alas, righteous one, disciple of Ezra.\" Another time they were reclining in Yavneh, and they heard a Divine Voice saying, \"There is here a man who is worthy of the Holy Spirit being upon him, but his generation does not merit it,\" and they cast their eyes on Shmuel HaKatan. And when he died, they would say, \"Alas, humble one, alas, righteous one, disciple of Hillel the Elder.\" And even he (i.e., Shmuel HaKatan) said at the time of his death, \"Shimon [the Righteous] and Yishmael [the High Priest] are destined to die, and the rest of their colleagues [are destined] for the sword, and the rest of the people to plunder, and great strife will ensue.\" And afterwards a judgment [was announced] in the Aramaic language, saying, \"Even regarding Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava it is decreed that they will say of him, 'Alas, humble one, alas, righteous one, disciple of Shmuel HaKatan,'\" but the opportunity was torn from them (since Yehuda ben Bava was executed by the government, see San. 11a:9).",

And the people wrote down the exact hour and the exact day [that the voice was heard], and it matched the exact hour that they were victorious. And Shimon the Righteous heard a voice from the Holy of Holies (in Aramaic): \"The decree that the enemy intended to bring against the Temple is annulled, and Gaskalgas (i.e., Caligula), has been killed and his decrees have been voided\" (ibid.). And in the Aramaic language was it heard.",
            "As long as Shimon the Righteous was alive, the western lamp was constant (i.e., continuously burning), [but] when he died, they went and found that it was extinguished. From then on, sometimes they found it extinguished, and sometimes they found it burning. As long as Shimon the Righteous was alive, the pile of wood [on the Altar] was constant. After they had arranged it in the morning, it kept going strongly the entire day, and they would offer up their daily offerings, and their additional offerings, and their libations, and they would not need to add [wood] to it except for the two logs of wood of the daily afternoon offering, in order to fulfill the mitzva of the wood, as it is said (Lev. 6:5), \"And the Kohen shall kindle [logs on it every morning].\" Once Shimon the Righteous died, the strength of the pile of wood grew weaker, such that after they had arranged it in the morning, they could not avoid replenishing wood on it the entire day. As long as Shimon the Righteous was alive, a blessing accompanied the two loaves [of the Omer] and the showbread. The two loaves were divided on Shavuot for the Kohanim, and the showbread on the Festival to all the men of the watch. And there were those of them who would eat and be satisfied, and there were those who would eat and leave some over, and only an olive's-bulk would come up into each of their hands. Once Shimon the Righteous died, a blessing no longer accompanied the two loaves or the showbread. The modest ones would withdraw their hands, and the gluttons would split it amongst themselves, yet only a bean's-bulk would come up into each of their hands. It so happened with one Kohen from Tzippori (Sepphoris) that he took his portion as well as his fellow's portion, and even though only a bean's bulk came up into his head, they would call him Ben Chamtzan (\"Son of Violence\"), until today.",
            "The year in which Shimon the Righteous died [he said to them] \"in this year I will die\" \"how do you know this?\" they responded. He (Shimon the Righteous) responded: \"all of the Yom Kippur days there was an old man dressed in all white who would go with me into the holy of holies and leave with me, on this year he went in with me but did not come out with me.\" Seven days passed after the holiday and he died. From the time of the death of Rebbi Shimon the Righteous they ceased blessing in the name of Hashem."

            "From the time that the Temple was destroyed, the <i>shamir</i> ceased to exist, as well as the \"sweetness of the honeycomb\" (Ps. 19:11). Said Rabbi Yehuda, what was this \"<i>shamir</i>\"? It was created on the sixth day of creation. When it is placed on top of stones, [or] on top of beams, cuts them opens as though they are two boards of a writing tablet, and not only that, but when it is placed on top of iron, it would split it open from top to bottom (בוקע ויורד), and there was nothing that could withstand it. How did they do it (i.e., restrain it)? They would bind it up in a soft woolen cloth, and place it inside a lead cylinder filled with bran flour. And with it Solomon built the Holy Temple, as it is said (1 Kings 6:7, JPS Tr.), \"When the House was built, only finished stones cut at the quarry were used, so that no hammer or ax or any iron tool was heard in the House while it was being built.\" [These are] the words of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Nehemiah says, they were sawed with saws from the outside, as it is said, (1 Kings 7:9, see Steinsaltz tr.), \"All these were costly stones, according to the measures of hewn stones, sawed with saws, from inside (מבית) to outside.\" What does \"from inside to outside\" come to teach? That in the Temple they were not heard; rather, they prepared it from the outside and they brought it inside. Said Rebbi, the words of Rabbi Yehuda are preferable to me as to the stones of the Temple, and the words of Rabbi Nehemiah as to the stones of his, (i.e., Solomon's) house (בית).",
