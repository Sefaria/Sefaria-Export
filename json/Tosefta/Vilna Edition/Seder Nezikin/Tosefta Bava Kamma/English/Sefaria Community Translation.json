            "1. The one who steals needs to pay double the value [of the animal.] If the thief cooked or sold, s/he pays four and five times.",
            "2. Rabbi Yochana ben Zakai used to say five things.",
            "3. There are seven thieveries. First - one who misrepresents [geneivat daat] themselves to others, one who insincerely invites another to their home, one who plies another with gifts they know they will not accept, one who impresses their guest by opening a barrel of wine already sold to a vendor, one who has improper measures, one who lies regarding weights, one who adulterates their merchandise... How do we know misrepresentation is theft? Because it says 'So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel' (II Samuel 15:6) ",
            "4. One who stole and afterwards cooked, one who stole and afterwards sold, one who stole and afterwards exchanged, one who stole and afterwards made sacred, one who stole and afterwards gave as a gift, one who stole and afterwards gave as credit, one who stole and afterwards paid one's debt, one who stole and afterwards gave as engagement gifts to the house of one's in-laws - [all those cases] pay four and five times."

            "... One who steals from a gentile is obligated to return the stolen material to the gentile. Theft from a gentile is more serious than theft from a Jew, because of the desecration of God's name. One who steals from a gentile or swears to him and then dies—he cannot be forgiven because of the desecration of God's name."
