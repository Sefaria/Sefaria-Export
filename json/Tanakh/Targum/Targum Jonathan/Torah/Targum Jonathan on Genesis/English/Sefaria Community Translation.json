For why was your offering accepted and my offering from me was not accepted [by God] with pleasure?\" Abel answered Cain and said, \"The world was created in compassion, and it is conducted based on the fruits (i.e. offerings) of good servants [of God], and there is no favor exercised in [God's] judgement. And because the fruits of my labor were better than yours, and [that my offering] preceded yours, my offering was accepted [by God] with pleasure.\" Cain answered and said to Abel, \"There is no judgement, and there is no judge, there is no next world, and good rewards will not be given to the righteous, and punishment will not be exacted on the wicked.\" Abel answered and said to Cain, \"There is judgement, and there is a judge, and there is a next world, and good rewards will be given to the righteous, and punishment will be exacted from the wicked.\" And in dealing with these matters they argued on the face of the field, and Cain arose onto Abel his brother and sank a stone into his forehead and killed him."
