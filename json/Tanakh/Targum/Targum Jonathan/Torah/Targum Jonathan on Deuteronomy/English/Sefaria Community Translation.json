            "These are the words of rebuke which Moshe spoke to all of Israel gathered before him; when they were on the other side of the Jordan river, Moshe said: \"In the wilderness of Sinai the Torah was given to you, and in the plains of Moab it was explained to you. The Holy One Blessed be He performed many miracles for you from the time that you passed at the seashore of the Sea of Reeds, He created a separate pathway for each of the tribes, yet you went astray from his words. You angered him in Paran with wailing, you pronounced lies and words of complaint for the portion that he rained upon you, white, from the heavens; You requested meat in Hatzeroth, and you became worthy of being destroyed from existence, if not for the remembrance of the merits of your righteous ancestors, the Tent of Meeting, and the Ark of the Covenant, and the holy vestments that you saw, of shining gold, which atoned for your sin of the golden calf."

They all replied in unison: Hear, O Israel: Hashem is our God, Hashem is one. Jacob replied: Praised be the splendor of God's kingdom for all eternity."
