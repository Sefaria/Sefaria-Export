            "Get up, go down to Nineveh, the great city, and prophecy upon them, for their evil has risen before Me.",
            "And Jonah got up to flee to the sea, from before prophesying in the name of the LORD, and went down to Joppa and found a ship that was leaving to the sea, and he gave the toll and went down in it to go with them on the sea from before prophesying in the name of the LORD.",
            "And the LORD rose up a great wind on the sea, and there was a great cyclone in the sea, and the boat would be breaking up.",
            "And the sailors were afraid, and each man pleaded from object of reverence, and they saw that there was no benefit to it, and they threw the weights that were on the ship into the sea to lighten it, and Jonah had gone down to the bottom of the corner of the ship and lay down and slept.",
            "And the captain of the sailors got to him and said to him, “What, are you sleeping? Get up, pray before your God! Perhaps there will be mercy from before your God on us, and we will not be lost!”",
            "And they said, one man to another, “Come on, let’s cast lots, and we’ll know on whose account this evil is ours.” And they cast lots and the lot fell on Jonah.",
            "And they said to him, “Tell us, now, you on whose account this evil is ours. What is your labor? And where do you come from? Which is your country, and of which people are you?”",
            "And he said to them, “A Jew am I, and before the LORD God of Heaven, who made the sea and the land, I revere.”",
            "And the men were afraid with a great fear, and said to him, “What did you do!?” because the men know that from before the LORD he had fled, since he told them.",
            "And they said to him, “What should we do to you to calm the sea from us!” For the sea was going and its cyclone was strengthening.",
            "And he said to them, “Hoist me and throw me into the sea, and the sea will calm from upon you. For I know that it is on my account that this great cyclone is upon you.",
            "And the men sailed about to come to dry land, but they could not, because the sea was going and its cyclone was strengthening upon them.",
            "And they prayed before the LORD and said: “Receive our pleas, LORD! Let us not now be lost for the guilt of the soul of this man, and do not put upon us the guilt of righteous blood! For You are the LORD; what is desired before You, You do!”",
            "And they lifted up Jonah and threw him into the sea, and the sea calmed from its cyclone.",
            "And the men revered with great reverence before the LORD, and they said they would sacrifice sacrifices before the LORD and pledge pledges."

            "And he said: I prayed, since in narrow straits was I, before the LORD, and He received my prayer from the lowest depths; I pleaded, You acted on my plea.",
            "And You threw me in the depths of the heart of the sea, and the river all around me, all the sea’s cyclones and waves passed over me.",
            "And I had said: “I am driven out from before Your Word; will I again gaze upon the palace of Your Holiness?”",
            "Water encircled me to death; depths surrounded me; the reedy sea rose over my head.",
            "To the roots of mountains You brought me down; earth drawing against me in strength to over all existence, and You — near before You to come up from the damage alive, LORD my God.",
            "In weariness my soul is upon me; of worshipping the LORD I am reminded, and entering before You is my prayer to the palace of Your Holiness.  ",

This is why I hurried to flee to the sea, since I know that You, God, are merciful and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in doing good, and You turn Your word back from bringing about evil.",
