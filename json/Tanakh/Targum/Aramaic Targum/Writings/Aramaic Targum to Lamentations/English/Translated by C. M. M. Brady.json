            "Jeremiah the Prophet and High Priest said, “<b>How</b> was it decreed that Jerusalem and her people should be punished with banishment and that they should be mourned with 'ekah. Just as when Adam and Eve were punished and expelled from the Garden of Eden and the Master of the Universe mourned them with 'ekah?” The Attribute of Justice replied and said, “Because of the greatness of her rebellious sin that was within her, thus she will <b>dwell alone</b> as a man plagued with leprosy upon his skin who sits alone. And <b>the city that was full</b> of crowds and many <b>peoples</b> has been emptied of them and <b>she has become like a widow. She who was great among the nations and a ruler over provinces </b>that<b> had</b> brought her <b>tribute</b> has become lowly again and gives head tax to them from thereafter.”",
            "When Moses the Prophet sent messengers to spy out the land, the messengers returned and gave forth a bad report concerning the land of Israel. This was the night of the ninth of Ab. When the people of the House of Israel heard this bad report which they had received concerning the land of Israel, the people lifted up their voice and <b>the people</b> of the House of Israel <b>wept that night.</b> Immediately the anger of the LORD was kindled against them and he decreed that it should be so in that night throughout their generations over the destruction of the Temple. When it was told through prophecy to Jeremiah the High Priest that Jerusalem would be destroyed at the hand of the wicked Nebuchadnezzar unless they repented, he immediately entered and rebuked the people of the House of Israel, but they refused to accept it. Therefore the wicked Nebuchadnezzar came and razed Jerusalem and set fire to the Temple on the ninth day in the month of Ab. On that night, the Congregation of Israel <b>wept bitterly and her tears flowed down her cheeks. There was no one to speak comfortingly to her</b> heart <b>from among all</b> her idols after whom <b>she loved</b> to follow. As a result, <b>all her friends</b> were wicked to her; they <b>turned against her and became her enemies.</b>",
            "The House of <b>Judah went into exile because they were oppressing</b> the orphans and the widows and because of <b>the great servitude</b> to which they were subjecting their brothers, the sons of Israel, who had been sold to them. And they did not declare freedom to their servants and handmaids who were of the seed of Israel. As a result they themselves were delivered into the hand of the nations. And the Congregation of the House of Judah <b>dwells among the nations and finds no rest</b> from the hard labor to which they subject her. <b>All who pursued her overtook her </b>as she was hiding<b> in the border regions</b> and they persecuted her.",
            "All the while that Jerusalem was built, the sons of Israel refused to go up to be seen before the LORD three times a year. Because of Israel’s sins Jerusalem was destroyed and <b>the roads to Zion are made mournful, for there is no one entering her at the time of the festivals. All the gates are desolate and her priests groan</b> because the sacrifices have ceased. <b>Her virgins mourn</b> because they have stopped going out on the fifteenth of Ab and on the Day of Atonement (which is on the tenth day of Tishri) to dance the dances. <b>Therefore she too is very bitter in her heart.</b>",
            "<b>Those who oppress her</b> were appointed over her <b>as leaders and her enemies </b>were dwelling at ease<b> since the LORD had broken her due to her great rebelliousness. Her children go before the oppressor into captivity.</b>",
            "<b>All the glory of the Congregation of Zion has gone out from her. Her nobles</b> were wandering for food, <b>like stags who </b>wander in the desert and <b>find no</b> suitable place for their <b>pasture. They went out</b> in great weakness and <b>they had no strength</b> to flee to safety (from) <b>before the pursuer.</b>",
            "Jerusalem remembered the days of old, when she was surrounded by walled cities and strong open towns, <b>rebelling </b>and reigning over all the earth, and <b>all her lovely things which she had in earlier times. </b>But because of her sins, <b>her people fell into the hands </b>of the wicked Nebuchadnezzar and he oppressed them and <b>there was no one to save her. The persecutors watched </b>her go into captivity <b>and they laughed because </b>her good fortune had<b> ceased from her.</b>",
            "Jerusalem sinned a great sin, therefore she has become a wanderer. All the nations that <b>had honored her </b>in earlier times <b>treat her with contempt for they have seen her nakedness. But she groans and shrinks back.</b>",
            "The impurity of the menstrual blood <b>in her skirts</b> has not been cleansed from her. And she did not regret her sins, nor <b>did she think of </b>what would befall her in <b>the end</b> of days. <b>And she went down </b>and fell and<b> was set aside. </b>And <b>there was no one to speak comfortingly to her. Look, O Lord </b>and see <b>for my enemies have exalted themselves over me.</b>",
            "The wicked <b>Nebuchadnezzar stretched out his hand</b> and drew forth his sword and <b>cut off all her lovely things.</b> Indeed, the Congregation of Israel began to howl for <b>she saw foreign nations go into her Temple; those about whom you commanded</b> by Moses the prophet concerning Ammon and Moab, <b>that they were not</b> worthy <b>to enter your assembly.</b>",
            "All the people of Jerusalem <b>groan</b> from hunger <b>and search for bread</b> to eat. <b>They gave their precious things for</b> the sustenance of <b>bread in order to stay alive. Look O Lord and see for I have become voracious.</b>",
            "I adjure you, all who pass by on the road, turn around here.<b> Look and see. Is there any pain like my pain, that which has been visited upon me because the Lord shattered me in the day of his great anger?</b>",
            "From heaven he sent fire into my strong cities and conquered them. He spread a net for my feet. He caused me to shrink back before my enemies.<b> He caused me to be desolate all day, unclean and </b>weak.",
            "<b>The yoke of my rebellion</b> was heavy <b>in his hand. Intertwined</b> like the tendrils of a vine, <b>they climbed upon my neck. My strength is weakened. The Lord has given me into the hands of one whom I cannot withstand.</b>",
            "The Lord has crushed all my mighty ones within me; he has established a time against me to shatter the strength of<b> my young men. </b>The nations entered by the decree of the Memra of <b>the Lord</b> and defiled <b>the virgins of the House of Judah</b> until their blood of their virginity was caused to flow like wine from a wine <b>press</b> when a man is <b>treading</b> grapes and the wine of his grapes flows.",
            "<b>Because</b> of the infants who were smashed and the pregnant mothers whose bellies were ripped open, the Congregation of Israel said, <b>“I weep</b> and <b>my eyes flow with</b> tears, a spring of <b>water, for far from me is any comforter to revive </b>me and speak words of comfort for<b> my soul. My sons are desolate for the enemy has become master</b> over them.”",
            "<b>Zion spreads out her hands</b> from anguish like a woman spread upon the birth stool. She screams but <b>there is no one to speak comfortingly to her</b> heart. <b>The Lord commanded</b> the House of <b>Jacob</b> to keep the commandments and Torah, but they transgressed the decree of his Memra. Therefore <b>his oppressors</b> completely <b>encircle</b> Jacob. <b>Jerusalem is</b> like an <b>unclean</b> woman <b>amongst them.</b>",
            "The Lord told the people of the House of Israel that they should not allow those who kill by the sword to pass through their land. Josiah the king went forth and drew his sword against Pharaoh the Lame on the plain of Megiddo, which he had not been commanded [to do] and he had not sought instruction from before the Lord. Therefore archers shot arrows at King Josiah and he died there. Before his spirit left him he moved his lips and said, <b>“The Lord is blameless for I have transgressed against his</b> Memra.” <b>Hear now all peoples,</b> the lamentations that Jeremiah made over Josiah <b>and see my affliction</b> that has come upon me after his death. <b>My virgins and young men have gone into exile.</b>",
            "Jerusalem said, when she was delivered into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, <b>“I called to my friends,</b> the sons of the nations, with whom I had made treaties to come to my aid. <b>But they deceived me</b> and turned to destroy me. (These are the Romans who entered with Titus and the wicked Vespasian and they built siege works against Jerusalem.) <b>My priests and my elders within the city</b> perish from hunger, <b>because they searched for</b> the sustenance <b>of bread</b> for themselves to eat, in order to <b>preserve their souls.</b>",
            "“Look, O Lord, for I am in anguish. Therefore my bowels are piled up and my heart turns within me, for I have surely transgressed the decree of the Memra of the Lord. Consequently, <b>outside the sword bereaves and inside</b> the agony of starvation, <b>like</b> the Destroying Angel who is appointed over <b>death.</b>",
            "“The nations heard that I am groaning and there is no one to comfort me. All my enemies heard of the evil that overcame me and <b>were glad. For you Lord</b> are the one who <b>has done</b> it. <b>You have</b> caused them to <b>bring upon me a day of retribution.</b> You have summoned against me a coalition to destroy me. May you summon against them that <b>they may be</b> made desolate <b>like me.</b>",
            "“May there enter before you on the great judgment day <b>all their evil deeds</b> which they have done to me. <b>May you turn against them as you have turned against me because of my many rebellions, for my groans are many and my heart is weak.”</b>"

            "<b>The Lord destroyed and did not spare any of the choice dwellings of the House of <b>Jacob. In his anger he destroyed the Congregation of the House of Judah and brought them to the ground. He broke the kingdom, crushed her leaders.</b></b>",
