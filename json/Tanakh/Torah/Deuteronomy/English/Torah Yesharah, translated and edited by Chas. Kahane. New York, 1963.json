            "These are the exhortations which Moses addressed to the entire young generation of Israel along the eastern side of the Jordan River. He told them of the sin of their fathers in the wilderness and their provoking the Eternal on the plain of Moab by worshipping the idol Peor; their murmuring against the Eternal at the Red Sea, and their transgression in Paran when they followed the discouraging words of the spies sent to explore the land of Canaan. He further reminded them of the disgraceful words they spoke against the Manna in Libnah and how they angered Him by demanding flesh in Hazeroth and by making the golden calf.<br>(יונתן.)",
            "The entire distance of the wildernes from Mount Horeb (Sinai) along the road from Mount Seir to Kadesh Barnea, the end of the wilderness, could have been crossed in eleven days; but because they provoked the Eternal, it took them forty years.<br>(רש\"י, א\"ע.)",

            "After he had defeated Sihon, the King of the Amorites, who had made his capital in the Moabite city of Heshbon, and Og, the king of Bashan, who had made his capital at Edrei, which was situated at the foot of Ashtaroth,<br>(רש\"י, א\"ע.)",
            "when Israel had gained some territory on the eastern side of the Jordan near the land of Moab and thereby could have a more settled life, Moses then began to expound this Torah to those who were born in the wilderness.

Go by the plain, in the mountains, in the lowland and the Negev, by the seashore until you reach the land of the Canaanites and Lebanon which is as far as the great river, the river Euphrates.<br>(רש\"י, א\"ע.)",
            "Mark! I am giving over the inhabitants of the land to you. You are commanded to occupy the land, for the Eternal promised your forefathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that He would give it to them and to their descendants after them.”<br>(רש\"י, א\"ע.)",

            "I cautioned your judges at that time, thusly: Listen not only in part, but to the entire cause of both parties of your fellow men, and execute justice between a man and his neighbor, and between landlord and tenant.<br>(רש\"י, א\"ע.)",
            "You must not show any partiality to any person in court cases; to minor cases must you give the same earnest attention as to major cases; you must not fear any personality, for the Eternal requires that justice be executed; but the case that is top difficult for you to handle, you will bring to me, and I will hear it.<br>(רש\"י, א\"ע.)",
