            "And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moshe spoke to the children of Yisra᾽el, according to all that the Lord had given him in commandment to them;",

            "Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the Lord swore to your fathers, Avraham, Yiżĥaq, and Ya῾aqov, to give to them and to their seed after them.",
            "And I spoke to you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:",

            "So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.",
            "And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.",
            "Do not respect persons in judgment; but hear the small as well as the great; do not be afraid of the face of any man; for the judgment is God’s: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it to me, and I will hear it.",
            "And I commanded you at that time all the things which you should do.",

            "And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one for a tribe:",

            "And you returned and wept before the Lord; but the Lord would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear to you.",

            "And the Lord said to me, Do not\n\t\t\t\tharass Mo᾽av, nor contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land for a possession; because I have given ῾Ar to the children of Lot for a possession.",
