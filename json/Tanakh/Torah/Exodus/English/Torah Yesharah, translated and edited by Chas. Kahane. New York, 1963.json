            "Joseph continued to hold high office throughout his lifetime and all his brothers were held in high esteem, until the time that they and all that generation of Egyptians died.<br>(א\"ע.)",
            "The children of Israel were fruitful — their wives gave birth to sextuplets — and they increased, and became exceedingly mighty; the land was filled with them in every branch of business and entertainment; but a large portion of them forgot the religious traditions of their ancestors.<br>(רש\"י, מדרש.)",

            "Be ready; let us deal craftily with them, lest they continue to increase; and when the hardships of war befall us, they also will join our enemies, fight against us, and we shall then have a pretext to drive them out of the land.\"<br>(רש\"י, ספורנו, רשב\"ם, ד\"ע.)",

So she took for him a box made of long reeds and lined it with slime and pitch to make it water-tight. Into this box she put the child and placed it among the reeds by the banks of the river, to obey the king’s decree.<br>(א\"ע, רשב\"ם, ספורנו.)",

            "Providence had ordained that the child should be brought up in the tyrant’s palace. Thus it came about that Pharaoh’s daughter went down to bathe in the public river, instead of in her private bath. And as her ladies-in-waiting walked by the river-side, she saw the box among the reeds, and sent her personal attendant for it, and she took it.<br>(מלבי\"ם, ספורנו.)",
            "When she opened it, she perceived the Divine Presence with the child, and the boy was weeping like a grown-up lad. She had compassion on him and said: “He is circumcised, therefore he must be one of the Hebrew children.”<br>(רש\"י, תלמוד, סוטה יא.)",
            "When his sister noted that the child refused the milk of other women, she joined the attendants and said to Pharaoh’s daughter: “Shall I go and call for you a wet nurse from among the Hebrews so that she may nurse the child for you?”<br>(רש\"י.)",

            "And the child grew up under his mother’s care. She instilled into him the belief in the Eternal and imparted to him the sacred traditions of his people. Then she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter, who reared him as her son. The Almighty had ordained it so that the child should not have the humble disposition of a slave, so that he would be able to help his people. And she called his name Moshe — Moses: meaning “drawn from the waters.\" She said: “Because I drew him out of the water.\"",
            "In those days, when Moses had become„great in the nobility, but nevertheless remembered his mother's teachings of mercy, he went out from the royal palace to his brethren and he saw the difficulties they were experiencing. He beheld an Egyptian taskmaster beating a Hebrew man, one of his kinsmen.<br>(רש\"י, מלבי\"ם.)",
            "He turned to all sides to see whether anyone would come to the aid of the Hebrew. When he saw that there was no man of courage to come to the Hebrew's aid, he fought with the Egyptian, slew him, and hid him in the sand.<br>(מפרשים.)",
            "When he went out the next day, and saw two Hebrew men quarreling, Moses said to the aggressor: “Why should you want to fight your brother Israelite?\"<br>(רש\"י, א\"ע.)",
            "And the aggressor replied: “Who appointed you a ruler or a judge over us? Do you look for an excuse to kill me, just as you killed the Egyptian?\" And Moses was distressed that such wicked men should be found among his brethren, and he said: “Now I know the reason why the Israelites suffer more than all others in Egypt; it is because there is no harmony among them.\"<br>(רש\"י בשם מדרש.)",
            "When Pharaoh learned of this thing, he wanted to kill Moses. But Moses fled from before Pharaoh, and he settled in the land of Midian, and he stayed by a well.<br>(ספורנו.)",
            "Now the Chieftain of Midian had seven daughters, and they would come and draw water, and fill the troughs to water their father's flocks.<br>(אונקלוס.)",
            "But the shepherds who wanted to water their sheep first came and drove them away. So Moses stood up, helped them, and watered their flocks.<br>(עפ\"י רמב\"ן.)",
            "When they came to their father, Reuel, whose title was Jethro, (meaning: “His Excellency\") he said: “How is it that you came so soon today?\"<br>(מפרשי אחרונים, הירץ.)",
            "They said: “A man, whose garb and speech are Egyptian, rescued us from the hands of shepherds, and he even drew water for us, and watered the flock.\"<br>(מדרש.)",

The Children of Israel sighed, for their hope that the new king would relieve them from their hard work had been in vain. They cried, and their cry of agony came up to the Almighty though it was not the voice of prayer to Him but the cry of bondage.<br>(א\"ע, רמב\"ן, ספורנו.)",

The thorn-bush was symbolic of the state of the Children of Israel — lowly and humiliated yet indestructible, for the Eternal dwells within them.<br>(רש\"י, א\"ע, מלבי\"ם.)",
