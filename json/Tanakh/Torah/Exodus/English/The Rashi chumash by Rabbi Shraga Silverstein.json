            "And Pharaoh heard this thing [through Dathan and Aviram], and he sought to kill Moses [He handed him over to the executioner, but the sword did not prevail against him (see 18:4)], and Moses fled from Pharaoh, and he abode in the land of Midian, and he sat at the well, [patterning himself after Jacob, who found his match thereby].",
