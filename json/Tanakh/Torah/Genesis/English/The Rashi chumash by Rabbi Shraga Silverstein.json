            "In the beginning of the creation by G-d [Elokim, the attribute of justice,] of the heavens and the earth, [G-d first intending to create the world with the attribute of justice but then granting precedence to the attribute of mercy (Yod-Key-Vav-Key), seeing that the world could not otherwise endure],",
            "the earth was vacuous and void, and there was darkness upon the face of the deep [i.e., the waters], and the \"wind of G-d\" [the Throne of Glory, impelled by His utterance] hovered over the face of the waters.",
            "And G-d said: Let there be light! And there was light.",
            "And G-d saw that the light was good, [and that it was not appropriate for light and darkness to serve in combination] and G-d separated between the light and the darkness, [making the day the domain of the first and the night the domain of the second].",
            "And G-d called the light day, and the darkness He called night. And it was evening and it was morning, the day of the One, [the angels not being created until the second day].",
            "And G-d said: Let there be a firmament [i.e., let the firmament be hardened] in the midst of the waters, [the upper waters being at a distance from the firmament just as the lower waters are], and let it divide between waters and waters.",
            "And G-d made [i.e., fixed in place] the firmament, and He divided between the waters below the firmament and the waters above the firmament; and it was so.",
            "And G-d called the firmament shamayim [sa mayim - it \"carries\" water (the upper waters); sham mayim - water is there; esh umayim - fire and water (the firmament being a combination of the two)]. And it was evening, and it was morning, the second day.",
            "And G-d said: Let the waters below the heavens, [which were spread over the entire earth], be gathered into one place [the ocean], and let the dry land be seen; and it was so.",
            "And G-d called the dry land \"earth,\" and the gathering of the waters He called \"seas\" [(plural, fish from different regions of the sea having distinctive tastes)], and G-d saw that it was good, [the \"work of the waters\" being completed on that day].",
            "And G-d said: Let the earth put forth [a blanket of] herbage, grass yielding seed, fruit-tree, [the tree tasting like the fruit], giving fruit of its kind, whose seed is in it [to grow a tree of the same kind] upon the earth; and it was so.",
            "And the earth put forth herbage, grass yielding seed according to its kind [though not having been commanded to do so], and tree giving fruit [(but not \"fruit-tree\" as commanded (11), for which the earth was subsequently punished, together with Adam)], whose seed is in it according to its kind. And G-d saw that it was good.",

            "And let them [in addition] be luminaries in the firmament of the heaven to illuminate the earth; and it was so.",
            "And G-d made the two great luminaries [(They were created of equal size, but when the moon protested \"two kings reigning with one crown,\" it was diminished)], the great luminary for governance of the day, and the small luminary for governance of the night, and the stars, [(G-d multiplying the moon's hosts to \"appease\" it for its diminution)].",

            "And G-d said: Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed upon the face of the earth and every tree which has in it fruit of a tree, bearing seed. To you shall it be for food, [man not being permitted to kill animals for food until after the flood].",
            "And to all the animals of the earth and to all the birds of heaven, and to all that creeps upon the earth, which has a living soul, (I have given) every green herb for food. And it was so.",

            "And G-d blessed the seventh day [through the manna (a presage of the future), double the normal amount being provided on the sixth day], and He sanctified it, [through the manna, none falling on the Sabbath], for on it He rested from all of His work which the L-rd had created to do. [i.e., What was to have been done on the Sabbath was done on the sixth day, the work of that day being doubled.]",
            "These [the above-mentioned] are the engenderings of the heaven and the earth, when they were created, on the day the L-rd G-d made earth and heaven [(whence it is derived that they were all created on the first day (see 1:14)].",
            "And every plant of the field was not yet in the earth, and every grass of the field had not yet sprouted [above the ground (the third-day sprouting (12) remaining beneath the surface)], for the L-rd G-d [(the first, Yod-Key-Vav-Key, being His name; the second, Elokim, connoting Ruler and Judge)] had not yet caused it to rain upon the earth, for there was no man to work the ground [and to appreciate the rain, until Adam was created, who recognized that rain was needed for the world, prayed for it, and \"secured\" it].",
            "And [for the creation of man (1:27)] a vapor rose from the earth and watered the entire face of the ground, [water, as it were, being added to the \"dough\" for the \"kneading\" of man].",
            "And the L-rd G-d formed (vayitzer) [two yods for two \"formings,\" one for this world, one for the resurrection (as opposed to the creation of the beasts (19), where only one yod is written)] the man, dust from the [four corners of the] earth. And He blew into his nostrils a soul of life, and man became a vital soul, [having speech and understanding (as opposed to the beasts)].",
            "And the L-rd G-d planted a garden in Eden from the east, and He placed there the man that He had formed.",
            "And the L-rd G-d caused to sprout from the ground [in the garden of Eden] every tree desirable to the sight and good for eating, and the tree of life in the very midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.",
            "And a river goes out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it parts and becomes four heads.",

[(see 2:20)]",
            "And the L-rd G-d formed from the earth all of the animals of the field [(same as 1:25)] and [also] all of the birds of the heavens, [forming them from slime (a combination of water (1:20) and earth)], and He brought (them) [on the very same day] to the man to see what he would call them. And every living creature that the man named — that is its name [forever].",

            "And the man said: This time [(Adam having lived with every beast and not having found gratification)], bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh. This shall be called ishah (woman), for from ish (man) was this taken [(whence it is derived that the world was created with the holy tongue)].",

            "And both of them were naked, the man and his wife, and they were not ashamed, [for they did not know the way of modesty, to distinguish between good and evil, until they had eaten of the tree of knowledge (of good and evil)]."

[speaking thus though seeing them eating from all the other trees, in order to turn the subject to that tree].",
