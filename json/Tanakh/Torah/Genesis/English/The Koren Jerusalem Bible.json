            "And they sent word urgently to Yosef, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,",
            "So shall you say to Yosef, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brothers, and their sin; for they did evil to thee: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Yosef wept when they spoke to him.",
            "And his brothers even went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we are thy servants.",
            "And Yosef said to them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?",
            "But as for you, you thought evil against me; but God meant it for good, to bring it to pass at this day that much people should be saved alive.",
            "Now therefore fear not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spoke kindly to them.",
            "And Yosef dwelt in Miżrayim, he, and his father’s house: and Yosef lived a hundred and ten years.",
            "And Yosef saw Efrayim’s children of the third generation: the children also of Makhir the son of Menashshe were born on Yosef’s knees.",
            "And Yosef said to his brothers, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you up out of this land to the land of which He swore to Avraham, to Yiżĥaq, and to Ya῾aqov.",
            "And Yosef took an oath of the children of Yisra᾽el, saying, God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here.",
            "So Yosef died, being a hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Miżrayim.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBereshit"
