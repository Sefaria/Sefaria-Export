            "The Torah has the nature and qualities of poetry, which is speech in flowery language. Everyone familiar with learning knows that flowery language differs from prose narrative in two  features of its nature and qualities. A.) In poetry, the idea is not laid out clearly the way it is in a prose narrative, and it requires marginal notes explaining to what narrative each stanza refers. This is not “derush”; this is just the nature of poetry… B.) Poetry is uniquely capable of alluding to things outside the conceptual scope of the poem, such as when the first letters of each stanza follow the order of the alphabet or the name of the author. This capability belongs to poetry, but not to prose narrative, as it famously requires distorting the language in order to achieve… and this feature can be found in the entirety of the Torah."

        "Introduction to Genesis": [
            "Rabbi Yochanan (Avoda Zara 25a) says that the book known as Bereshit is called The Book of the Upright (yashar) by the prophets, basing himself on Joshua 10:13 \"Is this not written in the Book of Yashar?” and II Samuel 1:18 \"Behold it is written in the Book of Yashar\". He explains that the reference is to Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yaakov who are called upright (yesharim) by Balaam in Numbers 23:10 \" May my soul die the death of the upright\".",
            " We need to understand why Balaam called our forefathers specifically yesharim (upright) and not tzadikim (righteous) or chasidim (pious), why Bereshit in particular is called The Book of the Upright, and why Balaam prayed that his end be like the yesharim.  ",
            "The answer is found in the verse of the Song of Haazinu (Devarim 32:4) \"The deeds of the [Mighty] Rock are perfect, for all His ways are just; a faithful God, without injustice He is righteous and upright.\" The word of praise \"upright\" (yashar) comes to justify God's judgment in destroying the second temple because the people were a \"crooked and twisted generation\" (Devarim 32:5). We have explained that the people were righteous and pious and studied Torah and yet were not upright in their social dealings. Due to the baseless hatred they felt for one another, they suspected anyone they saw acting differently from them in religious matters of being a Sadducee and a heretic. This led in extreme cases to bloodshed and every other evil in the world until finally the temple was destroyed. This justifies God's judgment because He is yashar and tolerates only tzadikim who are also yashar in their social dealings and do not act crookedly, even if motivated by fear of God. Such behavior leads to the destruction of creation and brings civilization to ruin. ",
            "And this was the distinction of the forefathers, who besides being righteous and pious lovers of God in every possible way were also yashar. That is, they behaved lovingly even towards the most despicable pagans and showed concern for their well-being, because that is how creation is preserved. We see this in our father Avraham. Even though he felt extreme hatred for the evil people of Sodom and their king, as we learn from his words to the king of Sodom (Bereshit 14:22-24), yet he desired their survival and prayed intensely for them. In Bereshit Rabbah (49:9) we find that God said to Avraham \"You loved justice and hated evil\" (Tehilim 45:8), meaning \"You loved to justify the actions of my creations and hated to accuse them of evil\". And this is exactly the quality of Avraham \"the father of a multitude of nations\" (Bereshit 17:4) because even if a son does not behave properly, his father still seeks only the best for him. Also Avraham's speech to Lot (Bereshit 13:8) is full of grace and courtesy. And we also see how just a few words of appeasement from Avimelech led Yitzchak to make peace with his enemy on terms even easier than Avimelech proposed (Bereshit 26:26-31). And our father Yaakov spoke softly to Lavan even though he knew that Lavan would have uprooted him completely if not for God's intervention.  The medrash (Bereshit Rabbah 74:10) says about this: Rather the strictness of the fathers and not the modesty of the sons. Even after Lavan angered him so, Yaakov made up with him quickly. We have learned much from the forefathers about derech eretz (proper behavior) which enables the world to survive, especially in Bereshit, the Book of Creation.  And that is why Bereshit is called Book of Yashar; because it tells the story of the fathers who acted decently. Balaam, when inspired by ruach hakodesh (prophetic spirit), did not wonder why he was not righteous and pious like Avraham, Yitzchak and Yaakov. He was after all a gentile prophet whose origins were from the source of tumaa (impurity). ",
            " He did, however, wonder why his social dealings were also evil. It was natural for him to profoundly hate the Jewish people for being the children of Avraham, Yitzchak and Yaakov whose origins were from the source of tahara (purity). But yet, it was not proper for him to seek to uproot an entire nation because that is not yashar behavior which sustains the world. And so he called out: \"May my soul die the death of the upright\". That is: \"May I be among those who sustain creation\".",
            "This explanation accounts well for the fact that the Book of Creation is called the Book of Yashar.       "

                    "<b>In the beginning <i>Elohim</i> [God] created:</b> <i>Elohim</i> means judge. Indeed, just like the statutes of the Torah are called judgement [or laws]. Similarly, the properties of nature that the Holy One, blessed be He, ingrained in His world are called judgement [or laws]. As is explained in [Tractate] Shabbat 155,  \"'The righteous One knows the judgement of the poor ones' (Proverbs 29:7); the Holy One, blessed be He, knows that that the dog's food [supply] is sparse, etc.;\" and the matter is not in the category of punishment, but rather this is [its] nature, and that is called judgement. And behold [regarding] the name, God/Judge, even though its simple understanding is the One who runs His world in judgement, nonetheless, here, its understanding is the One who creates His world with judgement. And this is its understanding in the Sifri, at the beginning of Parshat Ve'etchanan concerning the prayer of Moshe, \"Lord, God/Judge, in judgement have you created the world.\" And there, we explained with His help, may He be blessed, why the Sages, of blessed memory, explained the intention of Moshe in this way. And also see, what I have written further, Genesis 9:16, and in the Book of Exodus 6:2. ",
                    "<b>The heavens and the earth:</b> The clear simple explanation is that which was written by Ramban on verse 8, that [the Torah] is not speaking in this verse about the firmament that would on the second day be called, heavens; and about the dry land that would be called land on the third day. It [follows] from this that the firmament is not intrinsically and inevitably heavens, and so [too] dry land is not inevitably earth; rather [it is only that] the Holy One, blessed be He, called the firmament, heavens, and the dry land, earth; which is not the case in this verse - [instead, here] it is implied that, in essence and to begin with, their qualities are evident; which is that their names are heavens and earth, [even] without being given [these names.] Just like the name, dry land, is not [dependent on its] being given a name, but rather it is self-evident that dry dirt and soil is called dry land, based on its characteristics [and so will be explained about man, later.] And the explanation is that in the beginning of the creation, [it was] His will, may He be blessed, that all the workings of the world should be [by way of] emanator and recipient. An example is the sun and the seven planets that emanate to us. Nonetheless, they receive from what is higher than them. And about what is higher than them, we say in the prayer text, \"who takes out the sun from its place and the moon from its  dwelling place.\" And it is known that the movement of the sun and the moon is not in this fashion, but the intent  is [regarding] the causes of motion of the sun and the moon. And they are called according to their action, as per the explanation of Rambam, of blessed memory, on the Tractate Avodah Zarah - the form of the sun is the 'constellation' of the sun. And behold, all of the emanators [together] are referred to by the name, heavens [<i>shamayim</i>,] because of the letters [that form the combinations], <i>shem, yim</i>: the meaning of <i>shem</i> [name] is the latent potential to emanate; and <i>yim</i> is an even number [to indicate] the plural [form] as with <i>yadayim</i> [hands] and <i>raglayim</i> [feet]; and <i>eretz</i> [earth] indicates the recipient, the nature of which is to run [<i>ratz</i>] to receive the emanation. [And see what I have written in the book of Deuteronomy in Parshat Ha'azinu Hashamayim and in Parshat Berakha on the verse (Deuteronomy 33:28), \"even His heavens drop down dew.\"] And the verse did not explain anything about the highest emanators, since they cannot be fathomed, except by those of great intelligence. And whoever's mind is sharp will find a hint about it all, as it is with everything. And the earth begins from the higher waters, in the midst of which, afterwards God made the firmament. And the potential of the water above the firmament, and its form, was made different than the lower waters, as will be explained.  "

Even though it wasn't considered a doubt for him before he saw it; but this is the nature [of things], that seeing with the eyes is more effective than intellectual processes.

                    "<b>The light:</b> And it is not written like in every [other] section, \"and God saw that it was good.\" Since there are two understandings of the phrase, \"that it was good:\" A) That the thing was good for the goal for which it was needed. Even though its main purpose is not for a good goal, nonetheless according to what is needed, the thing is good; B) It is really good. And behold, in all of the creation, there are several things that are not good, like types of pests, but the Holy One, blessed be He,  saw that for the sake of the creation, it was necessary that it be this way. But light is definitively good. So much, that [it is said about] any good thing that it is light, as it is found (in Ta'anit 7  and Bereshit Rabbah 26), every [time the word,] light is mentioned with Eliyahu, the verse is speaking about rain. And that is because [rain] brings good to the world. (And Ramban in the beginning of Parshat Miketz gives a forced explanation of the matter.) And so, all success is referred to as a 'bright day' and the lack of success, darkness of night.' To the point where the poet made [it] a metaphor and said (Psalms 121:6), At day, the sun does not dim and the moon at night. And later (Genesis 28:15), we explained that the intention is about the time of success and its lack. And this is the expression of Scripture [that tells us] that the Omnipresent saw that light was intrinsically good.",
                    "<b>And God separated between the light and the darkness:</b> The meaning of separation has two understandings: A) A partition that separates between two things that are the same or different; B) A spiritual separation between two things - that appear to the human eye to be the same - like the separation between a day that is holy and [one that is] profane, since according to how it appears, what is the difference between one day and the next? Or the separation between [something] pure and impure, and many others. And here it should not be explained in the second way. Since light and darkness are anyway different to our sight, and are the opposite of each other. But rather [it should be explained] in the first [way], that he made a screen to separate. Which means [that this screen is found] in the time that is not light and not darkness. And so the Omnipresent, may He be blessed, implanted that the darkness should not come immediately after the light; but rather that the light should diminish continuously until it becomes dark. And behold, we find in Scripture that sometimes it is written \"that separates this from that,\" and sometimes it is written that \"separates between this and that.\" Meaning that where there is not, in the matter of the separation, an attenuated version of this and that, it is written, \"from.\" And where there is an attenuated version of this and that, in the matter of the separation, it is written, \"between this and that.\" (And see Exodus 8:19 and Exodus 26:33 and in several places, and so is it in every place, by the will of the Highest, may He be blessed.) And here it is according to our words; that the hour that separates them is sometimes closer to the light and sometimes closer to the darkness. And so is the nature of creation in all things that are deemed light and darkness, that there is a [gradual] distinction between them. And in this way man is able to tolerate the difference, according to the way of nature. "

                    "<b>And to the darkness, He called night:</b> The Sages, of blessed memory, explained in the beginning of Tractate Pesachim, that the Holy One, blessed be He, called to darkness and appointed it over the night. [By this,] our Rabbis taught us that we should not say that darkness is only the absence of light, like when - in the middle of the day - we close the windows, it becomes dark. For, if so, it would not be a creation. But in truth, darkness is a creation, on its own as well, as it is written (Isaiah 45:7), \"and created the darkness.\" And it is great distortion to say that darkness is only the absence of light. But rather, God makes both of them, just as He concerns Himself over holiness and impurity. (And see what I have written later, Genesis 27:9.) And to the question, \"what does this creation help, behold, even without [its] creation, there would be darkness in the absence of light?,\" the Sages, of blessed memory, have taught us (in the chapter \"<i>Chelek</i>\" and in Bereshit Rabbah, Parshat Noach and in the Talmud Yerushalmi in the first chapter) that the light of a fire does not shine during the day in a dark place, [with the same brightness] as it does at night when darkness reigns. And from this, lofty people were able to know while they were sitting in the dark, when it was day and when it was night - in which darkness rules. And as it is with the light and darkness of day and night, so too is it thus with all things that are compared to light and darkness; since there are many bounties that man does not feel so much when he is successful, until he becomes poor and he sees the bounty [that he once had].

                    "<b>And God made the firmament and He separated, etc.:</b> This verse says, 'explain me according to the simple meaning.' Since behold, this verse ends \"and it was so,\" and [so] what is the verse missing? And also, why is it written, \"and He separated, etc.\" - behold the firmament separates automatically? And also the difference [is noteworthy,] that [here] it is written, \"between the waters, etc and the waters etc. and not, \"the waters, etc. from the water,\" as in the previous verse. And also here it should have written, \"between the waters that are above the firmament and the waters that are below the firmament.\"  But to begin with, we must understand - is the screen between the waters according to its simple understanding not essentially needed for that day [alone]? Since behold, on the morrow, God said, \"let the waters gather, etc.\" and the lower waters were submerged very much; and if so there was no need for a screen that would separate between them and this is a wonder. But even more difficult is that which is found in Chagigah 15, that Ben Zoma peeked and saw that there is only two or three finger breadths between the higher waters and the lower waters, as it states, \"And the spirit of God was hovering over the waters.\" And [this is] surprising, since, behold they are far from each other like the sky is [far] from the earth. But all of this is explained according to the Midrash Kohelet, that [states] that the firmament is not the lower skies, that are upon the earth, but rather it is a second firmament, within which the luminaries were placed later and [which] is called the firmament of the skies and not just skies, and the Sages, of blessed memory, brought an explicit verse [to prove this] (Nehemiah 9:6), \"The skies [and] the skies of the skies and all of their hosts.\" And according to this, the explanation of, \"let there be a firmament in the waters and it will separate the waters from the waters\" is understood.  Meaning [that it is] between the waters that are above the lower ones and the waters that are above the higher skies which [comprise] the [actual] firmament. (And similar to this is found in the Guide for the Perplexed 2:30.) (And this is as is found in Shemot Rabbah 33: Above - \"let there be a firmament in the waters;\" Below - \"and the curtain will separate for you between the holy and the holy of holies\" (Exodus 26:33). Behold, the separation between the two waters is compared to the separation between the holy and the holy of holies, and this is as I have written.] From this, [we see that] the understanding of the separation of this verse is not a screen that separates, but rather an unusual entity between these waters. And the matter is clear that both of them are not in the form of waters that are visible to us in the lower world. Rather, the waters are purified and provide good and kindness in a different from, that is referred to here with the name, 'water;' and that is [God's] running [of the world]  which emanates great goodness and kindness. And about this [concept of 'water'], it is written (Psalms 42:8), \"The depths call to the depths [for the voice of Your water channels].\" And it is written (Psalms 65:10), \"the stream of God is full of water;\" and many [other] verses and midrashim [relate to this], and [this] is called by us, 'the upper waters.' And in truth, everything that is under the second firmament is exactly the running of the world through nature, and the luminaries and the 'constellations' control it and [they] are called 'lower.' And the verse [here] informs us that God separated between running the world through kindness and emanation - which is above the firmament, meaning above the running of the 'constellations;' and the waters that are below the firmament - which is  the running [of the world] exactly by the 'constellations.' And for this reason, it is written \"from on top of the firmament,\" the meaning of which is [to convey] not on top of on top; as is found in in the Chapter <i>Mitsvat Chalitza</i> about the wording of the verse (Deuteronomy 25:9), \"from on top of his foot.\" And so [too] is the understanding of \"from on top of the firmament,\" close to the firmament and not far [from it]. And it comes to make us understand that the intention is not that the upper waters are kindness that appears through complete and absolute miracles. For, if so, there would be no need for a separation from the kindness that is in nature, since it is automatically separated. And so [too], there would be no need to say that the waters that are under the firmament, means the physical waters and the ones that we see; for, if so, they are certainly not comparable to the upper waters. But rather, it is necessary to separate between the running [of the world] through providence and 'through hiding it from nature;' and between the running [of the world] through the 'constellations,' exactly according to nature. And this is what Ben Zoma peeked at and said that there is not more than two or three finger breadths between them; and it is hinted to in the earlier verse \"and the spirit of God,\" meaning His providence, may He be blessed, \"was hovering upon the face of the waters,\" which is the network of kindness in nature. And the meaning of \"and God made the firmament\" is that He refined and set it up on its essential foundations, (as I have written in Parshat Ha'azinu on the verse [Deuteronomy 32:6], \"He is your maker,\" and in several places), which means that the bottom face of the firmament would extend more towards the lower waters - which is exactly natural - and the upper face would extend more to the higher waters, like any thing that separates between two items. And [the reason that] it is written [here] \"between\" and \"between\" is as I have written earlier on verse 4. And this firmament is from the wonders of the Perfect Knowledges, may He be blessed, such that His providence, may He be blessed, is mixed together with nature, for each person according to his deeds. And about this, it is written (Psalms, 19:2), \"and the work of His hands is spoken by the firmament;\" that the Holy One, blessed be He, always does wonder [and] supervises his creatures and, nonetheless, gives nature dominion together [with His providence].

Firstly, we must explain the meaning of, “according to its specie,” or [what it means] when “according to its specie,” is written concerning what grows on the ground or the creations with living souls. And  [the Torah need to say this] because there is almost no species, within which are not included several sub-species. As with wheat, we find in Eichah Rabbah, …................?. And so [too,] there are many in each species. And at the time of the creation, only one wheat plant came, which was the best of that strain, but within it was the potential for several types. And about this, [the Sages] said in (Tractate Rosh Hashanah 11), “all creatures were created with their varieties.” And the main [meaning] here is, as written in Tosefot, that “varieties” [<i>tsivionan</i>] is related to the phrase [<i>tsvi ha'arets,</i>], which means with the greatest possible beauty. But it is not like the Tosefot wrote - that 'they are completely finished' is the meaning of the phrase [that is also] there: “they were [all] created in their stature;” but rather, 'in the most praiseworthy manner,' is its correct meaning. And also included in the meaning of “in  their varieties,” is that every fruit has different times as to when its beauty is most apparent. And with the fruit of the ground, the main beauty is at the time where it has not finished its growth and [at which time] the leaf appears green; which is not the case, when it is completely finished, behold [at that time] the herb withers and is not in its [greatest] beauty. But with a tree, it is not like this – even when the tree is completely finished [for that year], the leaf stays in its beauty; and is included in the understanding of 'varieties' at the time when they appear most beautiful. From here, it follows that it is not relevant to say, “according to its species” then, since, behold in the first coming forth, there was nothing but leaves. And [so] all of the types were the same in [any particular] strain. For this reason, “according to its species”  is not written in the proclamation. Which is not the case with the trees, about which it is written, “according to its species;” since at the time that it first came out, many types were included in it, and all of them were one specie; and for this reason [with trees,] there is no [prohibition] of mixing species (<i>kelayim</i>), as is known [from] the Chapter, “<i>Elu Terefot</i>,”  ",

But the phrase, \"let Us make man,\" means that there is no need to <i>give</i> [man] this name; rather his character shows that he is man. But, if so, it is difficult: why is it written afterwards that the Holy One, blessed be He, called their name, man; which implies that there was a need to give a name, and as I wrote regarding the name, sky and earth (<i>shamayim ve'aretz</i>). But rather the matter is like this - that man is different from all the species; since all the species were created in such a way that the species was unitary in its purpose and character; which is not the case for man, who rose in [God's] thought to be of two [types of] character. The one would be cleaving to his God, ready and serving in the world like an angel [does] in the heavens. And the second is [such] that he would be political and [take care of] his [own] needs; even though he would nonetheless do the will of God, it would not be on the level of the first. And behold, according to the first characteristic, he is automatically man (<i>adam</i>) based on the phrase 'I will be similar to the most High' (<i>edmee le'elyon</i>) - meaning that within him are included all the powers of the creation and he rules over everything. And behold, he is like the firstborn son of a king, who rules like the king. And because of this, everyone understands that he is the son of the king, in that they see him ruling over every detail. Which is not the case with a son of the king, who is not the firstborn; and the king [merely] makes him rule over some detail and his fellow over another detail, and so [too] with all those that govern the kingdom. It comes out that all of them together are similar to the king; but each one by himself is only similar to the king when he is given the name [of ruler] over that detail that he governs. And thus is man: the individual of spiritual stature is different then the simple individual. And in the Talmud, Shabbat 112b, they hinted to these two types of men. And it stated in the first version [of a particular statement], \"this is not a man;\" and in a second version, \"this is an example of a man,\" the explanation [of this being] a man of spiritual stature.

This stage is the true \"creation\" of something because without its purpose it cannot be said to exist. (See also Bereshit 39:22 and 41:34.) Now the purpose of Creation is God's glory as Isaiah (43:7) says: \"Everyone that is called by My name, and whom I created for My glory, I formed him, yea I made him.\" I have explained in Bamidbar (14:21) on the verse \"However, as surely as I live, and as the glory of the Lord fills the earth\" that God truly lives when Creation achieves its purpose and the world is filled with His glory. This goal is reached, however, only when God makes changes in Creation, either temporarily or permanently, which reveal Him as the Creator and Sustainer of the world. God causes those changes which are needed in each hour of need.  All this is included in the words \"His work that God created to do.\" God's personal Providence continues to create changes which bring the world to its ultimate perfection-  being filled with His glory.

God sits in heaven, as it were, and judges every person according to his actions. All this is due to man because everything depends on his actions. Now we have already explained (H.D. Bereshit 1:26) that there are two distinct types of man. One is elevated man who acts on the earth like the angels act in heaven and the second is practical, worldly man. Both types are needed to make Creation complete. If all men were of the elevated type like Adam before the sin there could be no reward and punishment and God's glory and kindness would never be revealed. So man of the second type is the principle source of God's glory. Even so, the existence of elevated man among the multitude of practical men is also a source of God's glory. Since the two types of man are like different species, they both needed to be created during the sixth day. If Adam had not sinned on the sixth day there would have been no possibility of creating practical man later and the world would not have achieved its purpose. And if only practical man had been created, there would be no possibility of the new species \"elevated man\" ever coming into existence. If Adam had not been enticed to sin, God would have created a second man of the practical type. As it happened both species were created in the same person- first elevated man and after the sin, Adam himself was transformed into practical man. In this way an ideal world was achieved. All this is implied by the words \"These are the results of the heavens and earth at the time of their creation.\"",

Earth appears here before heaven because the change which occurred on earth led to the change in heaven where God's Providence is determined by man's actions. The story continues by telling how it came to be that elevated man, who, like the angels in heaven, was not supposed to work the land, was banished from Eden and became practical man who works the land. This change achieved the purpose of creation- revelation of God's glory by His conduct of the world according to man's actions and His attributes. \"The heavens are My throne and the earth is My footstool.\" (Yishayahu 66:1)"

As it says in Kohelet (5:8) \"Even the King is subservient to the field,\" meaning even the king worries about the produce of the field. According to this explanation, we don't understand the message of the verse. But there is a deeper meaning to the word siach (bushes) based on the gemara Avoda Zara(7b), \"Siach means prayer as the Torah says (Bereshit 24:63) 'And Isaac went forth to pray (lasuach) in the field'\". Tosafot adds that it means fixed prayer also known as avoda shebalev (service of the heart). From the very start of creation God established that earning one's livelihood in the normal way of the world is involved with entreating God for His Providence by prayer or by sacrifices where possible. Both of these are called avoda (service), more than other mitzvot (commandments) of the Torah. Based on the verse (Mishlei 12:11) \"He who tills (oved) his soil will be sated with bread\" we may explain that all of man's activities can be performed to earn a livelihood or for some other purpose, but tilling the soil is done only to earn one's livelihood. And such is the difference between the avoda of performing other mitzvot and the avoda of prayer or sacrifices. The reward for observing other mitzvot is given in olam haba (the world to come) and also in olam haze (this world) one may receive rewards of wealth or honor, measure-for-measure. The reward for prayer and sacrifices, however, is primarily livelihood, as seen in gemara Ketubot (10b) which interprets the word mizbeach  (altar) as being related to nourishment (see also H.D. Bamidbar xx:xx) and also in gemara Shabat (10a) which states that fixed prayer sustains life. (See also Harchev Davar Bereshit 48:22.) The blessings recited over each type food also promote the abundance of that type as seen in gemara Berachot (35b) which considers someone who eats without reciting the blessing to be stealing from God and from the people of Israel and to be as evil as Yeravam ben Navat .(Based on Mishlei 28:24 \" He who robs his father or his mother and says, \"This is not a sin,\" is the companion of a destroyer.\") The explanation is that by not reciting the blessing one denies God the pleasure of providing an abundance of that food, in effect stealing from Him and from the people of Israel. And such a person is a companion of Yeravam who prevented the people from bringing sacrifices, thus denying them livelihood. (See Melachim I chapter 12.) ",
                    "Based on this introduction we may explain this verse to mean that prayer had not yet been introduced on earth because there was as yet no man to pray.               ",
                    "Rav Assi in the gemara (Hulin 60) cited by Rashi, resolves the contradiction between this verse and Bereshit 1:12 \"And the earth gave forth vegetation\" by saying that the vegetation was created on the third day but waited below the surface of the earth until man was created and prayed for rain. He learns from this that God yearns for the prayers of the righteous. The gemara continues with the story of Rabbi Hanina Bar-Papa who planted his garden with all kinds of seeds but nothing grew. Then he prayed for mercy and the rains came and the seeds grew, proving the statement of Rav Assi. According to this gemara, vegetation and fruits appeared on the earth only on the sixth day, after man sinned, was banished from Gan Eden, began to work the land and prayed for rain. Rav Assi's statement, attributing special qualities to the prayers of the righteous for sustenance, seems to be disputed by Medrash Rabbah (Vayikra 31) which says the prayers of all men are accepted by God equally in matters of livelihood and only in other cases of misfortune, God forbid, are the prayers of the righteous more effective. The medrash cites the examples of Sarah, Rivka, and Rachel whom God made barren so that their righteous husbands would pray for them. The answer is that Rav Assi's statement relates to a special case of livelihood, one in which sustenance is provided by a miraculous change in nature. The story of Rabbi Hanina Bar-Papa must be understood to refer to a situation in which all the other gardens grew normally and only Rabbi Hanina's did not, against the laws of nature, until he prayed.  Rav Assi applied this lesson to our verse as well, since God Himself created the vegetation so it certainly should have grown. God changed nature so the vegetation would not grow because He yearned to hear the prayers of the righteous.    All this is the opinion of Rav Assi, but that is not the plain meaning of the verse. The Ramban writes that all the vegetation appeared on the earth on the third day, but did not begin to produce new plants until man was created and began to pray. One may add also that the vegetation was created on the third day in its full height and beauty, and only after man prayed did it begin to grow gradually larger.  ",

                    "<b>And the serpent was more cunning, etc.:</b> Rashi explained in the name of Midrash Rabbah that it was jealous of them, in that it saw them copulating together and desired her. But this is a wonder! As behold, every creature only desires its species, as it is found in Tractate Bava Metzia 91b: \"Its species - it is drawn after its species.\" And behold the serpent was not lacking its female. And if it was on account of their having intercourse before the eyes of all, the serpent also did not know shame. Rather the matter is that it sensed that the clinging of the women to her husband was not like its female to it, which only occurred at the time of arousal for copulation. And that is only by happenstance and preparation for the thing. Which was not the case with the woman, who constantly clung to him: Given that she was the bone of his bones, the clinging was even more than a brother and sister. For they too are one flesh. However they are nevertheless not truly so like the first woman to Adam, who was like a limb to the head. And it was jealous of this. <b>And behold the matter is understood</b> that the serpent never spoke. For if it had originally spoken but was cursed to be dumb and silent, why is this curse not mentioned? Moreover, speech depends on intelligence, and as per Rashi's explanation of, \"and so man became a living soul\" Genesis 2:7) - with speech and intelligence. And likewise did Onkelos translate, \"With a speaking spirit.\" Behold man was unique in this virtue. However it was the constellation of the serpent that clothed himself with jealousy and spoke at that time from the throat of the serpent. As every species from all that was created - even the botanic - has a constellation; and that is the angel that is appointed upon that species to protect it and grow it, so that it not cease from the world. And this is like the Sages, may their memory be blessed, said, \"You have no [blade of] grass below without its constellation above striking it and saying to it, 'Grow!'\"  And the constellation of the serpent was like [the serpent]; as it was jealous of man's clinging to his Creator, may He be blessed. And it is just as we explained in the previous section, that Adam clung so greatly to God, like a portion that always yearns for its source; which is not the case with an angel. It is just separated and it is not clinging and yearning for His light, may He be blessed, except for at the time designated for song and that which is similar. And the angel was jealous about Adam; and the physical serpent about his wife. And [about] that which all of this is not explained in Scripture, the Ramban has already written, in Parashat Bechukotai - and we brought it earlier (Haamek Davar on Bereishit 1:1) - that regarding things that are not grasped by everyone, the Torah only spoke about it by hinting.",

                    "<b>You will not eat from all the trees of the Garden:</b> And the intent is that, in truth, Adam and Chavah had still not eaten anything. And that is because Adam - even though he was at that time in a place that it was necessary to use his senses for eating and for sex, according to the need of the creation which was created to be settled - nevertheless, they were like Moshe, our teacher, after he descended from the mountain. As he also had use of his senses for eating like all of Israel. And even regarding sex, had the Holy One, blessed be He, not warned him, \"and you, stand with Me,\" he would not have separated himself from [his wife]. But he was nevertheless very close, to be clinging to the Divine Presence anytime he wanted. And at the time that he was clinging to the Divine Presence, he did not desire to eat at all. And likewise was it with Adam, so he no longer desired to eat. And so too was the woman clinging to Adam, the life of her spirit. So they were satiated from love. Hence the serpent came with a temptation: That, behold, the world and its fullness was not created for nothing; and it is not the will of God that they not need the pleasures of the world. And if so, it is not fitting that they be engrossed in the love of God and in clinging. As it reduces and disturbs all the physical pleasures and it is against God's will. As behold, He said, \"You shall surely eat from every tree of the Garden.\" And the temptation of the evil impulse is like this in every generation, as is well known. At first, it removes the clinging to the Torah through [the fulfillment] of some commandment or something else which is truly correct for other people.

And at that time that the serpent spoke with her, Adam had gone away from her. So she felt a desire to eat, and said that she would eat. And regarding the clinging of Adam to his Maker, she did not feel it. Therefore she said, \"'Certainly 'we shall eat.'\" And she said, \"From the fruit of the tree of the Garden\"; and not like the language of God, \"from every tree of the Garden\" (Genesis 2:16) - which implies even the benefit from the wood, as I wrote above (Haamek Davar on Genesis 2:16).

As he was concerned, lest she pine to eat it. For only Adam, who clung to God with love, did not desire to do good for itself, since God's will was that he not know good and evil. But Adam had to concern himself about revealing the cause and the reason to the woman, who did not know about the love of God. Hence he simply said to her, \"of the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the Garden.\" And do not ask, \"If so, the tree of life is also included in this.\" As, in truth, with this, we can understand that which Onkelos translated above (Onkelos Genesis on Genesis 2:9), \"and the tree of life was in the middle of the Garden; and the tree from which the fruit, if eaten, gives knowledge (to differentiate) between good and evil\"; and he did not explain about eating the fruit of the tree of life.

[This is] like the way of [the true] purpose, which is not pleasurable to the palate, but is rather pleasure and enjoyment of God. That is not the case with the tree of knowledge of good and evil - the purpose brings physical enjoyment. Because of that, when Adam said, \"But from the fruit of the tree,\" she understood through it, that she was only prohibited from the tree that had fruit in it. But it appears to me that Adam was not concerned about this - that she not also eat from the tree of life. However it was worthwhile to distance her from that place. And because of that, he also said, \"and do not touch it.\" And we have already explained that this is hinted to in the word of God, that He forbade [the tree] also for benefit. But [Adam] explicitly warned about this, and said, \"lest you die.\" As he could not say, \"since you will die\" certainly, as they would not die for the touching alone, but rather lest they would come from this to eating. And all the more so [is this the case] according to our words - that he warned her about the two trees, lest she eat from the tree of knowledge and die.

However, one need not to resort to this explanation, it is possible to understand the word in both senses.  “Comfort” only applies to ongoing permanent tragedies, and not ones that arise from human activity and evil that arose during the days of Noah.  Similarly, “rest” does not apply to the land, which was permanently cursed by God (since the land remained in this state even after the flood.)  The name “Noah” includes both roots – “comfort” and “rest.” This is why the word is spelled nun-chet without a third letter, so that it can be considered a cognate of both roots.  “This one will console us” can be understood in both senses, similar to Rashi’s explanation.\n"

Though the manner of the relationship is explained in Rashi's commentary according to the aggadah in Sanhedrin (89) - if it is so, they are distant in time from one another, according to the tradition that Yitzchak was thirty-seven at the time of the binding. And there are some that explain that it is a punishment for the covenant he made with Avimelekh. But this is also not proximate in time - for behold that the matter of the covenant was at that [same] time, of Yitzchak and the expulsion of Yishmael. In truth, there is an argument in the Midrash if, \"after (<i>achar</i>)\" is proximate, and \"following (<i>achrei</i>)\" is remote, or the opposite. However it appears that the explanation of, \"after these events\" [here], is after all the utterances and statements that there were between the Holy One, blessed be He, and Avraham. And He had raised him - little by little - higher and higher: From the beginning of His blessing him with the Land of Israel and with seed like the dust of the earth; and afterwards with the increase of children like the stars of the sky - meaning people of great worth - and afterwards, He blessed him at the time of the circumcision that the would be a father to many nations. That is that he would have the ability to have even the nations of the world - who would be called by the name, nations, and would not completely convert - recognize the God of the world. However there was still a particular that was missing, as will be explained. And the matter of the binding was after all of these things. For with this, the greatness of Avraham, our father, and his seed was completed, such that nothing more was needed. So from then on, the Holy One, blessed be He, did not speak with him; and there was no more content and addition to the goal that had been desired. And because of that. it is written, \"<b>and God tested (<i>nissa</i>) Avraham</b>.\" As even though the text does not depart from its straightforward understanding, which is the matter of a test - according to its straightforward understanding alone, it is superfluous. As we surely see that it is a test. And this is even though we should not ask why God, who knows everything from the beginning, needs a test - as it is a question of [divine] knowledge and [human] choice, which is loftier than human knowledge. So we should [just] know that the ways of God are above our ways, as are His thoughts [above] our thoughts. However there is another meaning to this, as it is found in Rabbah (Bereishit Rabbah 55:1) on this: <i>Nissa</i> is from the usage, \"You have given a banner (<i>nes</i>) to those who fear You, that it may be displayed (<i>lehitnosess</i>)\" (Psalms 60:6) - meaning He raised him upon a banner. The Sages, may their memory be blessed, explained that with this test, He extended the power of Avraham, our father, and raised him to the purpose of the Israelite nation, as will be explained. And the Sages, may their memory be blessed, in Rabbah there, have already drawn a metaphor about the content of the test with three analogies: 1) To a good jug that a buyer knocks, as opposed to a bad one. 2) To good flax that he hits much; so that the more he hits it, the more it improves, as opposed to bad flax. 3) He adds much to the load of a good donkey, and examines it [to determine whether] it can carry more. And the matter of the three analogies is to teach us that a test comes for three aspects. On one occasion, it comes like the analogy of the good jug, about which the knocking is not in order to improve it, but rather to know how strong the jug is. And on [another] occasion, it comes like the analogy of the flax, about which the knocking does not come in order to know [its] strength, but rather to improve [it]. And on [a third] occasion, it comes like the analogy of a donkey, about which it does not come in order to know [it] or in order to improve [it]; rather when its owner has a large load, he is testing his donkey [whether] it can carry more, which will be good for him. And the owner will add to its nourishment afterwards according to the additional load that his donkey carries. Likewise on one occasion, a test comes to know the power of a person's righteousness, and that is considered an examination. On [another] occasion, a test comes in order to add to his righteousness. As even though this action rests in a person's potential, so long as the action has not come to him and he has not actualized the potential, this potential has nevertheless not become rooted within him. Therefore, the Holy One, blessed be He, brings him to this test; and he [then] strengthens himself to actualize his potential and roots this potential inside himself. And on [a third] occasion, a test will come for the iniquity of the generation. So He will place them - a load of afflictions - upon the righteous one, and he will receive his full reward afterwards. From here, the midrash on this section teaches us that we should not think that this test came about only like the first analogy of the jug, as an examination. For if so, Avraham, our father, did not become elevated with this. It is not so. Rather the Holy One, blessed be He, raised the power of our father Avraham's holy being with this action. And that is the meaning of, \"[God] <i>nisa</i> Avraham, from the usage, \"You have given a banner (<i>nes</i>) to those who fear You, that it may be displayed (<i>lehitnosess</i>).\" And with that which this potential was rooted into Avraham's being, this action remained rooted in the Israelite nation for [all] generations - as will be further explained on verse 17 (Haamek Davar on Genesis 22:17). And see Exodus 16:4 and Deuteronomy 8:2 and 9:7. Furthermore, it should be explained that which, \"test,\" is not also written about Yitzchak - as behold, he was already thirty-seven years old! However it shall be explained below that the purpose of this act upon Yitzchak was on account of the settlement of Israel upon their land, [such that] their bread was fixed by way of the daily sacrifices. So it was particularly fit that it would be so through Yitzchak, since this principle came out to the world with his birth, as I wrote earlier [on] 21:3 (Haamek Davar on Genesis 21:3). So it was not for the purpose of a test; and it was then like the other tests through which Avraham was tested, and about which it was [also] not written that it was a test. However, that which the Holy One, blessed be He, hid the intent from Avraham, our father - that was only in order to be a test. ",

Rather this multiplication is largeness of the soul, like above 17:2. So here the seed of Avraham was blessed with the commandment of the sanctification of [God's] name - as it is found in Sanhedrin [in the] chapter [entitled] Ben Sorer ouMoreh, that Israel is commanded about the sanctification of [God's] name, but the nations of the world are not. And it is understood that this only glorifies Israel. For behold, a civilized person will not request from his fellow to cut off his hand for the sake of his [own] life. But that is not the case from his son, whom he loves like his [own] soul, and whom he knows about himself that he would do the same for the sake of his son's life. It is [hence] no wonder that it is likewise fitting that the son should do so for the sake of his father. It comes out that this desire shows [their] soulful love, since they are both like one body, and [that] he would give everything he has for his life. And so did the Holy One, blessed be He, command His children - who are His portion, may He be blessed and the bearers of His Kingship - to give over their lives on account of His name and His glory, which is, as it were, His life. It is as it is written (Numbers 14:21), \"However, just as I live and the Glory of the Lord fills the entire land,\" and as I have written in explantion of that verse there (Haamek Davar on Numbers 14:21) and in several places. [But] this is not the case with the nations of the world, as they are removed from Him, may He be blessed. And Avraham merited this deed so that his children would attain largeness of the soul to willingly give themselves over on account of the sanctification of [God's] name, may He be blessed. And God said that this multiplication would be in two aspects: The first is <b>as the stars of the sky</b> - these are the greats in knowledge, who shine in their generations like the stars of the sky. And they also give merit to the masses, in that which they give themselves over and are killed for  the sanctification of [God's] name. And the second is <b>and like the sand on the seashore</b> - these are the masses of the people. When they come to the sanctification of [God's] name, they give themselves over with a good heart. And this is such that the idolaters are compared to the seas, as it is written in the book of Isaiah (17:12), \"they roar like the raging seas.\" And it is written in the Song of Songs (8:7), \"Great waters will not quench the love,\" which is referring to the idolaters. And the waves of the sea futilely appear as if they are flooding the sand around it. And in fact, [the sea] sometimes floods over many grains of sand surrounding it without number. Yet they are nevertheless broken on account of the sand. Likewise are the nations of the world not able to flood the largeness of their souls and their inner strength. And see Bava Batra 8 (7b) - as they explained the statement of David, \"I count them; they exceed the sand\" (Psalms 139:18), like this: \"Just like the sand [...] protects from the sea [etc.].\"",

Hence his children merited that a thread of grace would be extended over them [when giving these sacrifices], like the principle of the one who occupies himself with Torah. As it is found in Avodah Zarah 3b, \"Anyone who occupies himself with Torah at night, a thread of kindness, etc.\" And we have already explained several times that the meaning of listening to the voice, is understanding and precise inference about [the speaker's] words.

Rather, this is simply referring to the question that Pharaoh asks Joseph. Joseph was wondering why Pharaoh hadn't consulted with his sorcerers, and Pharaoh responds that he had but they couldn't answer him. And from there, there's no cause to wonder about [why] the Sages (חכמים) [were not mentioned] because their wisdom wasn't sufficient enough to understand the deep details of such a dream. But the sorcerers who made magic needed such details in order to interpret the dream, and if so, it is obvious that [he didn't need to mention the Sages]. [summary - the Sages and the sorcerers needed each other to properly interpret the dream, and thus the fact that one of them couldn't do anything logically implies the other couldn't as well]."

                    "He guided his hands for Menashe was the firstborn. It is extra for we known from the parsha that Menashe was the firstborn. But this has depth and intension for truthfully, Yaakov shouldn't have guided (crossed) his hands, rather switched the positions of the boys. But since Menashe was the firstborn, he intended that Menashe should stand by Yaakov's right leg and Efrayim by his left leg. Only his hands did he guide that they should be crossed. The reason is that even though Yaakov put Efrayim before Menashe and therefore in the wilderness he was the head of his flag group (which Menashe was also a part of) still, in the counting of Parshas Pinchas, it was the opposite. Not only that, but even in the counting of Parshas Bamidbar it is written by all the (other) flags \"and those that camp upon him\" as opposed to with Menashe it is written, \"and upon him the tribe of Menashe.\" All this comes to teach us that Efrayim only came before Menashe in matters of spirituality, that which is higher than the natural happenings of the world. In matters of the world, however, Menashe came before Efrayim. Therefore in the first counting at Mt. Chorev, where the Divine precence was upon their heads and the conduct was beyond nature, Efrayim came first. But in the counting in the Plains of Moav, when they were entering the Land, which was basically in a natural way (as is explained later in Bamidbar and Devarim) therefore Menashe came first. (And check out what I write in Bamidbar regarding the change of \"and upon him the tribe of Menashe.\" The occurred because with regards to natural occurrences, the advantage of the firstborn is very impactful as I wrote earlier (27:19). Now, the hand services the head and the mind and the foot services the goings of the body according to its nature. That's why the Sages said in their way: The son is the foot of the father. Meaning: the natural mannerisms of the father that goes on its own without thought and wisdom. Therefore, Jacob desired that Menashe stand by his right leg and guided his hands so that Efrayim would be on his right hand. See more in Verse 20. That is why the verse specified \"because Menashe was the firstborn.\""

However, others have claimed that the expression אביר יעקב actually is a name for the Holy One of Blessing as we find in other places.... and making an oath by Avr Yaakov can be explained by the verse in Devarim 32:9 \"Yaakov His allotment\" (allotment = chevel = rope) we explained there that the Jewish people are compared to a rope which is twisted together from many strands, and at the top it is thick and at the bottom, it is separated into different strands.  So too the Holy One of Blessing is the ultimate soul of all souls which comprise the Jewish people, as we find in Sanhedrin 64a: \"if a Jewish person is suffering, what does the Shechinah say? My head hurts, etc.\". If a thread is pulled at the bottom of the rope, the top of the thick rope feels it as well. This is the great strength of Joseph.  It is because of this that it is forbidden to take revenge against one another, as it is written in Vayikra 19:18, and this is the reason of Yosef."
