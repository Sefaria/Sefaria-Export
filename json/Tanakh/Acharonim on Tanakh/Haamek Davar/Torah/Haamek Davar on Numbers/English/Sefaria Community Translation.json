And the earlier count was 605,550 and the [requirement for] the dwelling of the Divine Presence was fixed at that amount, and it was known that it was necessary for there to be this amount in the desert. And from then on, even if there were many that turned twenty, they did not enter the army to fill this amount with [these] others who turned twenty. And since they stood in one place [since that count], the Holy One, blessed be He, did not concern Himself to command that they fill the army [for those that had died in between], until the twentieth day of the second month approached. As they were then prepared to leave on the journey with God at their head, like a king at the head of his armies. Hence the command came to count again and to fill this amount... [just like] every king knows how many are going out in the army in his force and how many units, and the amount in each unit..."

And the phrase \"however, to the family, etc.\" is only advice, as mentioned in the tractate Yesh Nochalin. It has been clarified earlier that due to their significance, the divine authority allowed for the passing of inheritance. They are like women who have already given birth from another tribe, and they inherit and pass on the inheritance, as explained shortly after. And because of this minor distinction, it does not harm the establishment of the sanctity of the land. However, it is advised that they should not appear more important than any other daughters of their tribe. Therefore, they should conduct themselves like all of them, as it is prohibited to pass on inheritance in that generation.
