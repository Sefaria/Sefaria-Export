For example, the ephod atones for idolatry, the pants atone for illicit relations, and the tunic for bloodshed (Zevachim 88). Chazal said that one punished even for his thoughts about transgressing only by idolatry. Therefore, the Kohein Godol’s sash, which atones for idolatry, must atone for thoughts as well, and thus it is a mixture of wool and linen like the ephod. However, an ordinary <i>kohein</i>’s garments atone for illicit relations and bloodshed, in which thoughts are not considered like deeds, and therefore their sashes are not a mixture of wool and linen.  ",
            "The reason thoughts are considered like deeds regarding idolatry is because in general transgression occurs through a person’s physical action, but the essence of idolatry is in the mind. Therefore, if he intended to worship idolatry the thought is combined to the deed. Now, there are three roots of transgression: Idolatry, illicit relations, and bloodshed. All the others branch out from these: The transgressions that stem from physical desires and envy are rooted in illicit relations, those that are caused by jealousy and harm another are included in bloodshed, and those between man and his Creator are rooted in idolatry. A person has no physical desire for idolatry; it is an error of the intellect. On Yom Kippur, when we are fasting, and thereby removed from physical desires, our souls are connected to their spiritual source: the Holy One, blessed be He. As a result, we are not prone to sin in idolatry. Therefore, at that time the Kohein Godol does not wear the ephod, and his sash is made of linen, for there is no need for an atonement for idolatry, since the Jewish people’s attachment to Hashem is the purification from any errors of the intellect."

            "<b>And you reap its harvest.</b> Here, Hashem’s will is revealed that Bnei Yisroel should not become materialistic in working the land. The Creator gave many commandments relating to each activity in the field, in every step, to unite all of a human being’s activities to Hashem. All the materialistic activities become illuminating and radiant ways to reach true perfection and closeness with Hashem … And so, at the beginning of the harvest the Torah commands to bring the <i>omer</i> and the “two breads” to Hashem, and then they will be permitted to eat from the new crop. Similarly, at the end of the harvest you may not harvest completely, rather you must give to the poor, and in the middle of the harvest you must not gather the gleaning … The principle is that the beginning, middle, and end of the harvest is sanctified to Hashem, and sanctified to the matters by which mercy and kindness will be implanted within them. These are the very means by which a Jew reaches the fulfillment of completeness and the purpose acceptable to Hashem. Therefore, the section on appointed times concludes (v. 22), “When you reap the harvest …” Although these commandments were previously written in Parshas Kedoshim, it was repeated to arouse our hearts to this realization."

            "<b>I will not despise them.</b> This matter can be explained as follows: Let us examine something about the ways of the Heavenly Hashgachah, at least what is comprehendible to us. When the Heavenly Wisdom decreed that the people of Israel would have to wander in foreign lands for very many years, many methods and strategies were considered so that Israel would remain in existence as a nation and not assimilate into the gentile nations. The nation’s spiritual giants were well aware of this, and made fences and restrictions with which the nation could exist in the crash of the ocean’s waves and not sink into the stormy, torrential abyss. Therefore, Yaakov commanded in no uncertain terms to be buried in the land of Canaan, so that Israel would know who their nation’s forefathers are, and that their lineage is in the land of Canaan. In this way a natural connection was embedded in his descendants’ soul to yearn for their forefather’s land and to consider themselves as strangers in foreign lands. The nation’s Torah giants learned from this, and led by Ezra and the men of the Great Assembly, they restricted the nation in eighteen matters to separate them from the ways of the gentile nations. The people of Israel would know they are guests and strangers in a strange land; they are like shoots of the olive tree that cannot be grafted unto any other tree.  ",
            "Israel has been among the non-Jews many, many years — none of the world’s inhabitants could believe the Jewish nation would exist for such a long time in such a miraculous fashion; it is incomprehensible to any intelligent person. For the thousands of years that swept over the diminutive nation, so weak and helpless, it was the way of Hashgachah that they would rest for close to a hundred or two hundred years. Afterwards, a storm wind would emerge and give rise to many waves; it would destroy, decimate, wear them out, demolish, and sweep away without mercy. The Jews would flee to a distant place and there they would reunite into a nation. They would grow, rise up, their wisdom would lead them to success, until they would forget they were strangers in a strange land. They would think this is the place from which they originated, and lose hope for Hashem’s spiritual salvation at the appointed time. There, an even stronger storm wind would come and it would remind them with a raging sound and an earthquake: “You are a Jew. Who made you into a man? Go for yourself to a land you do not know.” When we use our intellect to examine history, we see the alternating pattern of the Jew’s situation and his existence among the nations. This is for two reasons: To keep the true religion and its purity, and for the nation’s continued existence. For when the Jewish people rest among the gentile nations they will prosper, Torah and its discussion will increase. Their sons will be successful, but they will disagree with their parents. For this is man’s desire; the new generation has novel ideas, and more nerve to delve into what was hidden from the previous generation. This relates to human sciences, which originate in the human intellect. But it does not apply to the Divine religion that was given from Heaven … The Divine spiritual manifestation was always continuous. In the First Temple period the Divine Spirit dwelled, there were prophets and the sons of prophets, and there were the Urim and Tumim. Even during the Second Temple period they said: From there one can draw Divine Inspiration … But all this is absent in the exile, in which the gathering and the assembly for Torah study has decreased, and for this reason no rabbinic court may make any new decrees … This is the nation’s pattern: When they enter a foreign land they will not be Bnei Torah, for they are diminished from all the troubles, evil decrees, and expulsion. Afterwards the Divine Spirit awakens in them, and it aspires them to return to their origins, the quarry of holiness. They will study Torah, teach it, and have great successes until the Torah’s prestige is uplifted to the pinnacle. Now, the sons of the generation have nothing more to add to disagree with their fathers. What will be with man’s desire to be distinguished and create novel ideas? They will find fault with conceptions, deny what was passed on to them by their fathers, and conjecture new ideas whilst forgetting what their nation experienced — the endless wandering in a sea of troubles. Inevitably, they will soon retort: “Our fathers passed on to us falsehood.” The nation will abandon religious study and study foreign languages; they will think that Berlin is Jerusalem. “You have done like the worst of them, but like the best of them you haven’t done.” Then a storm wind will come and a tempest will uproot the nation from its main root, and put it in a distant nation whose language they never learnt. They will know they are strangers; they will realize that their language is the Holy Tongue and they simply change foreign languages like suits of clothing … In their wandering they will forget His Torah, its depth and sharp discussions. There, they will rest somewhat, and be awakened with holy feelings. Their sons will have courage and the young men will be successful in Torah study. This is the meaning of, “I will not despise them.” Despising refers to the low level of the nation in Torah and spiritual enlightenment influenced from our Torah, the Written and the Oral Tradition. “And I will not loathe them” refers to being repulsed and expelled from place to place. “To annihilate them” is the exile; “to break My covenant with them” is forgetting the Torah."

Such a thing has no time limit. Each person needs to appraise himself as to the amount of time he needs to reign in his urges, whether 30 or 100 days, according to his nature. The test of whether he has reached completion, and his urges will not hold sway over him, is when he looks at his own affairs like someone looking at someone else’s actions, and he is not preoccupied with self-love. At such a level, one can be assured that he will only benefit from worldly pleasures in the proper amount and he will not be drawn after luxuries. On the contrary, he will have pleasure in this world and will have positive interactions with other people. Therefore, the Torah uses a language of “he shall bring himself” as if he were bringing another man. One should view his own affairs with the same perspective he views another man’s virtues and weighs him on the scales of justice."

And there is a stronger trust, like the trust of a son in his father, the king that he will look after him and provide for everything that he needs. All of these concepts apply to Hashem, for He is our King and He is our Father… He knows everything that happens to us and what is in our hearts, and the actions of every person. Therefore he is more concerned with our wellbeing than we are ourselves. If so, a person can sit securely, at peace and tranquility, and not take any more precautions than those that Hashem decreed on us to take… This is the meaning of the verse, “Cling to Him.” When a person understands that he is clinging to Hashem, and attached to the Higher Providence from Hashem, and Hashem is aware of everything he does more than he himself is aware, and Hashem wants each of us to succeed more than we do ourselves… This is called “attachment.” This is a general <i>mitzvah</i> which has different aspects to each member of the nation without exception… With this a person will not be afraid of any person or enemy or any event other than Hashem, since he trusts in Hashem alone.

The husband stated that the father gave his daughter over to turpitude, and educated her in an inappropriate lifestyle such that she had behaved promiscuously in her father’s house. Therefore the verse states: “He has promulgated libelous words.” Therefore he pays for the embarrassment of her father, one hundred silver coins to her father, and he is flogged for the fact that he attempted to have her killed. Therefore this is like a case of payment for one crime and lashes for another."
