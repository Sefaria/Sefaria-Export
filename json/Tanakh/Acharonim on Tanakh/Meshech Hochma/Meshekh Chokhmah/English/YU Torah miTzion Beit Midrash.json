            "‎“Now, Pharaoh should find an‎‏ ‏understanding and wise man”‎ ... <br> Pharaoh was holy to the Egyptians. As‏ ‏such, it wasn’t his role to look into‏ ‏human affairs and the ‎matters of his‏ ‏land. And because “the highest over the‏ ‏high waits, and there are higher ones‏ ‏over ‎them,” theft and robbery were‏ ‏rampant. Woe to the land whose leaders‏ ‏are many! Therefore, in ‎Egypt there was‏ ‏a tremendous distortion of justice as‏ ‏was seen when a person from a far land‏ ‏was ‎thrown in prison for life over a‏ ‏personal matter, imprisoned‏ ‏without justice. Every bureaucrat did as he‏ ‏pleased. Therefore, Pharaoh was shown‏ ‏the dreams ‎about the cows first, to‏ ‏demonstrate that Hashem wasn’t going‏ ‏to have the famine impact ‎Pharaoh, for‏ ‏the sake of the animals, “Hashem saves‏ ‏for the sake of animals.” For this reason‏ ‏Yosef stated, “As to the repetition of the‏ ‏dreams.”‎ ‎“Now, Pharaoh should find an‏ ‏understanding and wise man”‎‏ ‏‎-‎‏ ‏‎“man”‎‏ ‏and not “godly” or “holy”, for his‏ ‏greatness [in leadership] should be that‏ ‏he knows the ways of civility and‏ ‏organization. [Therefore,] ‎‎“He should be‎‏ ‏placed over all of Egypt”‎‏ ‏‎– that‏ ‏everything should be in his hands. If a‏ ‏bureaucrat were ‎to twist the law, his eye‏ ‏would be above him watching. No one‏ ‏would be able to decide law on their ‎own‏ ‏without first consulting the leader of‏ ‏Egypt. And therefore the cows were‏ ‏mentioned first, to ‎point out the‏ ‏corruption of justice in the land of‏ ‏Egypt. And when [Pharaoh] appointed‏ ‏him, he stated ‎‎- look and oversee all the‏ ‏affairs of the land, for “I’ve given you all‏ ‏of Egypt.” If there is a twisting of ‎the‏ ‏law, it will be dealt with by you‏ ‏alone. Therefore, when Yosef wanted to‏ ‏imprison his brothers ‎without a trial‏ ‏and consensus of the community, he‏ ‏said, “You are spies!”‎‏ ‏‎- something that‏ ‏would ‎involve the monarchy and would‏ ‏not need to be publicized amongst the‏ ‏populace [in order to be ‎acted upon].‎‏ ‏Similarly, Yosef stated, “I am Pharaoh,”‎‏ ‏referring to the divine monarchy in the‏ ‏Egyptian ‎language. [This communicates‏ ‏that] it is below my honour to supervise‏ ‏the iniquity and tricks of ‎people.‎‏ ‏‎“Without you...” for you will supervise all‎‏ ‏that occurs in the land of Egypt.‎‏ ‏Understand this.”‎"

            "For the prophecy of all of [the  prophets] was via signs and wonders, and anyone who believes [solely] based on signs has a flaw in his faith, unless [the prophet who performs the   sign]   is   endorsed   by   a prophet  who  is  known  to  be  a  valid prophet,  as  in  the  case  of  Elisha,  who was   endorsed   by   Eliyahu.   The   only reason [to believe a sign at all] is that the Torah   said   to   believe   a   prophet   who presents  a  sign  or  wonder,  just  as  it instructed   to   believe   witnesses   even though  there  is  no  guarantee  that  they always testify truthfully... Moshe was not like this, for all Israel heard G-d speak with Moshe face-to-face, and all of them attained the level of prophecy and saw how G-d spoke with him.  Therefore  Shemot 19:9 said, “Behold, I am going to come to you in the thick of the cloud, so that (the nation will hear  when  I  speak with you),  and  they will also believe in you forever”... ",
            "But if so, how could G-d command that they always believe in Moshe? “All is in the hands of Heaven, except reverence for Heaven” (Berachot  33b), and  how could [Moshe’s prophetic] knowledge compel his choice?Perhaps Moshe could later choose, G-d forbid, to add to Torah on his own! It must be that G-d removed from Moshe freedom of choice in entirety, and he remained compelled, like angels ... But all Israel, who were not worthy  of such a level and a prophetic encounter, but only experienced it in order to uphold the religion – lest some sower of confusion come contradict one  point  via sign  or  wonder – they needed to ascend to that high level to hear the voice of G-d speaking from within the  fire ... But afterward, they  returned to free choice, without which their existence would have no purpose ...",
