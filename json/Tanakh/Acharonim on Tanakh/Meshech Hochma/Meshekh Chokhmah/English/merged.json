            "Let us make man in our image:  The image of G-d is free will, without any natural external inclination, only from free will and intellect.   G-d's knowledge does not impinge on free will, because his knowledge stems not (in the same way as the) knowledge of man which comes from his senses, rather it is He alone who perceives, as is explained in the Rambam. Behold it is not in our ability to understand how this works...rather this we know:  Free will is a condensation of G-dliness, because G-d provides place for his creations to do as they choose, and removed from their actions, the decree and the decision on an individual level...The torah speaks in the way that people speak - let us leave a place for man's personal choice, that he won't be forced in any of his actions, and in the obligation of his thoughts, to be free to do good or evil as he desires.  He will be able to do things against his more natural state, and against those things which are straight in the eyes of G-d....."

            "<b>...And you shall be fruitful and multiply:</b> The superficial reading of the verses is according to the baraita at the end of [the chapter entitled] Chezkat HaBatim ... Hence it states that even at a time when there is much [destruction by the] sword and spilling of blood, you should not look at that; as I will require the soul of the man - \"and one who spills the blood of a man, ...his blood will be spilled. Rather \"You should be fruitful and multiply,\" and not say, \"Why should we give birth for panic and failure? It is better that [life] cease on its own!\" You should not look at [it that way].",
            "\"Be fruitful and multiply, etc.\" It is not far fetched to say that the reason the Torah exempted women from the mitzvah of Pru U'Rvu and obligated only men is because the laws of Hashem and His ways \"... are pleasant and all of his paths peaceful\" [Mishlei 3:17] and he did not amass on a Jewish person what the body can not tolerate.  Everything that is prohibited by the Torah there is a permitted alternative as detailed in [Tractate Hullin 8th chapter] \"Kal Habasar\". Due to this principle there is only one day in the calendar th at we are [biblically]  obligated to not eat [Yom Kippur] and the preceding day [the 9th] we are warned and obligated TO eat. Similarly the Torah does not prevent marital relations from any creature besides for Moshe Rabenu because there was no one else as exalted and required such carefulness with his body as Moshe. Similarly, the during wartime when the [Jewish] army is successful and the passions run high  Hashem realized there is no way to stop the [soldiers wild] spirit as he desires the beautiful [captive] women [Deuteronomy 21:11] and the Torah allowed this women to the soldier [as outlined by Deuteronomy 21:11]. The Torah is only bending in response to evil inclinations and passions. This principle [of the Torahs ways are pleasant] became a corner stone of legal policy to our predecessors who established laws and exempted a Yibum who's children died after her husband died. Women endanger themselves in pregnancy and childbirth, that has been established as a legal principle that death is prevalent [see Tosfos Ketubot 83b]. As a result women are not commanded with the mitzvah of Pru U'Rvu. For the same reason a woman is allowed to drink a potion that makes her sterile [from having children] as Yehudit the wife of Rav Hiya [Yevamot 65b]. Women desire to have children is much stronger than men, as we see with Rachel who demanded from Jacob children \"or its as if I'm dead\". This explains what Rav Yosef said in Tractate Yevamot [65b] that women are exempt from Pru U'Rvu. The verse states \"I am El-Shadai, Pre Urve\" [singular form] and it doesn't use the plural form Pru U'Rvu. Adam and Even who were commanded together with Pru U'Rvu were commanded before the first sin and at that time there was no pain associated with childbirth. Therefore it was a mitzvah for both Adam and Eve to Pru U'Rvu. After the sin when there is pain in childbirth and frequently can be dangerous and life threatening [its not longer a mitzvah for women]. We see that women are known to swear never to become pregnant again while in labor. Noah [after he left the arc] was commanded with Pru U'Rru [in the plural form, and this was after the first sin], however the Torah in the verses preceding the command its written in the Torah that G-d blessed Noah and his sons, whereas their wives are not mentioned, since they are not obligated in the command of Pru U'Rvu. By Jacob its written \"Pre Urve\" [Genesis 25:1] [in the singular form] which is accurate [way the command should have been addressed]. The Maharsha in his commentary to Tractate Sanhedrin 55..."

            "<b>But rather go to my land and to my birthplace:</b> And it is likely that Abraham did not say that he should go to [Abraham's] family, but just to the city in which he was born. And he should take a wife from there [for Issac], even if she is not from his family, as long as she is from that city. And hence he said that the maiden in whom he will see generosity to toil and water his camels is fit to get married to the son of Abraham. And it would certainly find favor in the eyes of the maiden and her father to marry into [the family of] Abraham. So there was no divination.

But in truth, Abraham only commanded him about the city in which he was born. And hence he gave [the bracelets] before he asked, \"Whose daughter are you?\" As whoever she was, she should marry the son of Abraham...

As‏ ‏such, it wasn’t his role to look into‏ ‏human affairs and the ‎matters of his‏ ‏land. And because “the highest over the‏ ‏high waits, and there are higher ones‏ ‏over ‎them,” theft and robbery were‏ ‏rampant. Woe to the land whose leaders‏ ‏are many! Therefore, in ‎Egypt there was‏ ‏a tremendous distortion of justice as‏ ‏was seen when a person from a far land‏ ‏was ‎thrown in prison for life over a‏ ‏personal matter, imprisoned‏ ‏without justice. Every bureaucrat did as he‏ ‏pleased. Therefore, Pharaoh was shown‏ ‏the dreams ‎about the cows first, to‏ ‏demonstrate that Hashem wasn’t going‏ ‏to have the famine impact ‎Pharaoh, for‏ ‏the sake of the animals, “Hashem saves‏ ‏for the sake of animals.” For this reason‏ ‏Yosef stated, “As to the repetition of the‏ ‏dreams.”‎ ‎“Now, Pharaoh should find an‏ ‏understanding and wise man”‎‏ ‏‎-‎‏ ‏‎“man”‎‏ ‏and not “godly” or “holy”, for his‏ ‏greatness [in leadership] should be that‏ ‏he knows the ways of civility and‏ ‏organization. [Therefore,] ‎‎“He should be‎‏ ‏placed over all of Egypt”‎‏ ‏‎– that‏ ‏everything should be in his hands. If a‏ ‏bureaucrat were ‎to twist the law, his eye‏ ‏would be above him watching. No one‏ ‏would be able to decide law on their ‎own‏ ‏without first consulting the leader of‏ ‏Egypt. And therefore the cows were‏ ‏mentioned first, to ‎point out the‏ ‏corruption of justice in the land of‏ ‏Egypt. And when [Pharaoh] appointed‏ ‏him, he stated ‎‎- look and oversee all the‏ ‏affairs of the land, for “I’ve given you all‏ ‏of Egypt.” If there is a twisting of ‎the‏ ‏law, it will be dealt with by you‏ ‏alone. Therefore, when Yosef wanted to‏ ‏imprison his brothers ‎without a trial‏ ‏and consensus of the community, he‏ ‏said, “You are spies!”‎‏ ‏‎- something that‏ ‏would ‎involve the monarchy and would‏ ‏not need to be publicized amongst the‏ ‏populace [in order to be ‎acted upon].‎‏ ‏Similarly, Yosef stated, “I am Pharaoh,”‎‏ ‏referring to the divine monarchy in the‏ ‏Egyptian ‎language. [This communicates‏ ‏that] it is below my honour to supervise‏ ‏the iniquity and tricks of ‎people.‎‏ ‏‎“Without you...” for you will supervise all‎‏ ‏that occurs in the land of Egypt.‎‏ ‏Understand this.”‎"

            "For the prophecy of all of [the  prophets] was via signs and wonders, and anyone who believes [solely] based on signs has a flaw in his faith, unless [the prophet who performs the   sign]   is   endorsed   by   a prophet  who  is  known  to  be  a  valid prophet,  as  in  the  case  of  Elisha,  who was   endorsed   by   Eliyahu.   The   only reason [to believe a sign at all] is that the Torah   said   to   believe   a   prophet   who presents  a  sign  or  wonder,  just  as  it instructed   to   believe   witnesses   even though  there  is  no  guarantee  that  they always testify truthfully... Moshe was not like this, for all Israel heard G-d speak with Moshe face-to-face, and all of them attained the level of prophecy and saw how G-d spoke with him.  Therefore  Shemot 19:9 said, “Behold, I am going to come to you in the thick of the cloud, so that (the nation will hear  when  I  speak with you),  and  they will also believe in you forever”... ",
            "But if so, how could G-d command that they always believe in Moshe? “All is in the hands of Heaven, except reverence for Heaven” (Berachot  33b), and  how could [Moshe’s prophetic] knowledge compel his choice?Perhaps Moshe could later choose, G-d forbid, to add to Torah on his own! It must be that G-d removed from Moshe freedom of choice in entirety, and he remained compelled, like angels ... But all Israel, who were not worthy  of such a level and a prophetic encounter, but only experienced it in order to uphold the religion – lest some sower of confusion come contradict one  point  via sign  or  wonder – they needed to ascend to that high level to hear the voice of G-d speaking from within the  fire ...

            "<b>Girded him with the sash.</b> The garments of the kohanim atone for sin. For example, the ephod atones for idolatry, the pants atone for illicit relations, and the tunic for bloodshed (Zevachim 88). Chazal said that one punished even for his thoughts about transgressing only by idolatry. Therefore, the Kohein Godol’s sash, which atones for idolatry, must atone for thoughts as well, and thus it is a mixture of wool and linen like the ephod. However, an ordinary <i>kohein</i>’s garments atone for illicit relations and bloodshed, in which thoughts are not considered like deeds, and therefore their sashes are not a mixture of wool and linen.  ",
            "The reason thoughts are considered like deeds regarding idolatry is because in general transgression occurs through a person’s physical action, but the essence of idolatry is in the mind. Therefore, if he intended to worship idolatry the thought is combined to the deed. Now, there are three roots of transgression: Idolatry, illicit relations, and bloodshed. All the others branch out from these: The transgressions that stem from physical desires and envy are rooted in illicit relations, those that are caused by jealousy and harm another are included in bloodshed, and those between man and his Creator are rooted in idolatry. A person has no physical desire for idolatry; it is an error of the intellect. On Yom Kippur, when we are fasting, and thereby removed from physical desires, our souls are connected to their spiritual source: the Holy One, blessed be He. As a result, we are not prone to sin in idolatry. Therefore, at that time the Kohein Godol does not wear the ephod, and his sash is made of linen, for there is no need for an atonement for idolatry, since the Jewish people’s attachment to Hashem is the purification from any errors of the intellect."

            "<b>And you reap its harvest.</b> Here, Hashem’s will is revealed that Bnei Yisroel should not become materialistic in working the land. The Creator gave many commandments relating to each activity in the field, in every step, to unite all of a human being’s activities to Hashem. All the materialistic activities become illuminating and radiant ways to reach true perfection and closeness with Hashem … And so, at the beginning of the harvest the Torah commands to bring the <i>omer</i> and the “two breads” to Hashem, and then they will be permitted to eat from the new crop. Similarly, at the end of the harvest you may not harvest completely, rather you must give to the poor, and in the middle of the harvest you must not gather the gleaning … The principle is that the beginning, middle, and end of the harvest is sanctified to Hashem, and sanctified to the matters by which mercy and kindness will be implanted within them. These are the very means by which a Jew reaches the fulfillment of completeness and the purpose acceptable to Hashem. Therefore, the section on appointed times concludes (v. 22), “When you reap the harvest …” Although these commandments were previously written in Parshas Kedoshim, it was repeated to arouse our hearts to this realization."

            "<b>I will not despise them.</b> This matter can be explained as follows: Let us examine something about the ways of the Heavenly Hashgachah, at least what is comprehendible to us. When the Heavenly Wisdom decreed that the people of Israel would have to wander in foreign lands for very many years, many methods and strategies were considered so that Israel would remain in existence as a nation and not assimilate into the gentile nations. The nation’s spiritual giants were well aware of this, and made fences and restrictions with which the nation could exist in the crash of the ocean’s waves and not sink into the stormy, torrential abyss. Therefore, Yaakov commanded in no uncertain terms to be buried in the land of Canaan, so that Israel would know who their nation’s forefathers are, and that their lineage is in the land of Canaan. In this way a natural connection was embedded in his descendants’ soul to yearn for their forefather’s land and to consider themselves as strangers in foreign lands. The nation’s Torah giants learned from this, and led by Ezra and the men of the Great Assembly, they restricted the nation in eighteen matters to separate them from the ways of the gentile nations. The people of Israel would know they are guests and strangers in a strange land; they are like shoots of the olive tree that cannot be grafted unto any other tree.  ",
            "Israel has been among the non-Jews many, many years — none of the world’s inhabitants could believe the Jewish nation would exist for such a long time in such a miraculous fashion; it is incomprehensible to any intelligent person. For the thousands of years that swept over the diminutive nation, so weak and helpless, it was the way of Hashgachah that they would rest for close to a hundred or two hundred years. Afterwards, a storm wind would emerge and give rise to many waves; it would destroy, decimate, wear them out, demolish, and sweep away without mercy. The Jews would flee to a distant place and there they would reunite into a nation. They would grow, rise up, their wisdom would lead them to success, until they would forget they were strangers in a strange land. They would think this is the place from which they originated, and lose hope for Hashem’s spiritual salvation at the appointed time. There, an even stronger storm wind would come and it would remind them with a raging sound and an earthquake: “You are a Jew. Who made you into a man? Go for yourself to a land you do not know.” When we use our intellect to examine history, we see the alternating pattern of the Jew’s situation and his existence among the nations. This is for two reasons: To keep the true religion and its purity, and for the nation’s continued existence. For when the Jewish people rest among the gentile nations they will prosper, Torah and its discussion will increase. Their sons will be successful, but they will disagree with their parents. For this is man’s desire; the new generation has novel ideas, and more nerve to delve into what was hidden from the previous generation. This relates to human sciences, which originate in the human intellect. But it does not apply to the Divine religion that was given from Heaven … The Divine spiritual manifestation was always continuous. In the First Temple period the Divine Spirit dwelled, there were prophets and the sons of prophets, and there were the Urim and Tumim. Even during the Second Temple period they said: From there one can draw Divine Inspiration … But all this is absent in the exile, in which the gathering and the assembly for Torah study has decreased, and for this reason no rabbinic court may make any new decrees … This is the nation’s pattern: When they enter a foreign land they will not be Bnei Torah, for they are diminished from all the troubles, evil decrees, and expulsion. Afterwards the Divine Spirit awakens in them, and it aspires them to return to their origins, the quarry of holiness. They will study Torah, teach it, and have great successes until the Torah’s prestige is uplifted to the pinnacle. Now, the sons of the generation have nothing more to add to disagree with their fathers. What will be with man’s desire to be distinguished and create novel ideas? They will find fault with conceptions, deny what was passed on to them by their fathers, and conjecture new ideas whilst forgetting what their nation experienced — the endless wandering in a sea of troubles. Inevitably, they will soon retort: “Our fathers passed on to us falsehood.” The nation will abandon religious study and study foreign languages; they will think that Berlin is Jerusalem. “You have done like the worst of them, but like the best of them you haven’t done.” Then a storm wind will come and a tempest will uproot the nation from its main root, and put it in a distant nation whose language they never learnt. They will know they are strangers; they will realize that their language is the Holy Tongue and they simply change foreign languages like suits of clothing … In their wandering they will forget His Torah, its depth and sharp discussions. There, they will rest somewhat, and be awakened with holy feelings. Their sons will have courage and the young men will be successful in Torah study. This is the meaning of, “I will not despise them.” Despising refers to the low level of the nation in Torah and spiritual enlightenment influenced from our Torah, the Written and the Oral Tradition. “And I will not loathe them” refers to being repulsed and expelled from place to place. “To annihilate them” is the exile; “to break My covenant with them” is forgetting the Torah."

Such a thing has no time limit. Each person needs to appraise himself as to the amount of time he needs to reign in his urges, whether 30 or 100 days, according to his nature. The test of whether he has reached completion, and his urges will not hold sway over him, is when he looks at his own affairs like someone looking at someone else’s actions, and he is not preoccupied with self-love. At such a level, one can be assured that he will only benefit from worldly pleasures in the proper amount and he will not be drawn after luxuries. On the contrary, he will have pleasure in this world and will have positive interactions with other people. Therefore, the Torah uses a language of “he shall bring himself” as if he were bringing another man. One should view his own affairs with the same perspective he views another man’s virtues and weighs him on the scales of justice."

In the Sifei, the Sages derived that the enemy should not be surrounded on four sides from, “as Adonoy had commanded Moshe.” Ramban held the view that just as it is a commandment to seek peace, so too, it is a commandment to leave them a side to flee so they can save their lives. Rambam, however, does not count this as a positive commandment, because he held the view that this is a strategy of warfare. If Bnei Yisroel were to surround their enemy on all sides, this would cause them to despair that they will fall captive to their enemy, and they will be fortified with all their strength to fight valiantly. Therefore, this was not relevant to be counted as a positive commandment."

And furthermore a murderer in exile always hopes that perhaps the anointed Cohen will die and he will be free with his death. But Hashem had said that Elazar [the kohen gadol] would be present for the dividing of the land. Consequently, the murderer has no hope of returning until the land will be settled. Therefore in such a situation where he has no hope of returning immediately the Torah did not require exile.",

However, the truth is that the blessing is not only for this purpose … When a person eats and is full, he is more likely to rebel against Hashem … therefore Hashem commanded that when a person eats and is satisfied he should mentions Hashem and offer Him thanks by blessing Him. In this way the person will remember who gave him the strength to act, and from whose Hand he takes the food to ease his hunger.

Despite the exile the nation continues to exist in its unique way, with its glory and splendor. After the destruction of the Second Temple they thought that it would be impossible to continue to exist, and that they would be destroyed in the future, wandering like gypsies without dignity. This belief was strengthened when they saw what happened at Beitar, when only a few survived the Bar Kochba revolt. However, when they saw that a later king arose, filled with compassion, who decreed that they could bury their dead, they understood that Yisroel is a sheep amongst the seventy wolves, but with the kindness of Hashem and through the kindness of kings, they would be able to continue and strengthen and gain wisdom. When the waves of the sea come to drown them, the wind will come after and quiet the waves, through rulers and advisors whose hearts are in the hand of Hashem, who act as agents of kindness. Therefore they established the blessing of “Who is good and Who does good” as a blessing of the continued existence of the nation.",

            "<b>Cling to Him.</b> In my opinion this is a separate mitzvah that includes every person in the nation, each according to his ability. For this reason we only find allusions and hints to it in the Torah. It refers to trust … the concept is that there is moral trust, like the trust of a nation in their king that he will be concerned with their needs, and there is natural trust, like a woman who trusts that her husband will provide for her needs. And there is a stronger trust, like the trust of a son in his father, the king that he will look after him and provide for everything that he needs. All of these concepts apply to Hashem, for He is our King and He is our Father… He knows everything that happens to us and what is in our hearts, and the actions of every person. Therefore he is more concerned with our wellbeing than we are ourselves. If so, a person can sit securely, at peace and tranquility, and not take any more precautions than those that Hashem decreed on us to take… This is the meaning of the verse, “Cling to Him.” When a person understands that he is clinging to Hashem, and attached to the Higher Providence from Hashem, and Hashem is aware of everything he does more than he himself is aware, and Hashem wants each of us to succeed more than we do ourselves… This is called “attachment.” This is a general <i>mitzvah</i> which has different aspects to each member of the nation without exception… With this a person will not be afraid of any person or enemy or any event other than Hashem, since he trusts in Hashem alone. Due to our many sins, this trust has been lost and caused the people of our generation to distance themselves from Torah scholars, and to distance their children from learning Torah. When we look to the future what will become of them?"
