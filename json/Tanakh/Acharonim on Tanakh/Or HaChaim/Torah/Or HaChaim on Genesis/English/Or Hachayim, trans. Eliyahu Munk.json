                    "The heavens opened and I beheld visions of the Lord, the Creator of the universe from one end to the other, and I was endowed to understand as much as it was deemed appropriate to reveal to me at the beginning of my sacred words. I feel that I have been awakened by the advent of Torah from the East. The first word of the Torah <span class=\"font1\">בראשית</span>, is in the genitive, meaning <span class=\"font1\">ראשית דבר</span>, the beginning of some matter. (Had the Torah written <span class=\"font1\">בראשונה</span>, \"at the beginning,\" this would have been normal). The possessive form, however, poses a problem. What if anything could this word be related to, seeing nothing existed as yet? The \"<span class=\"font1\">דבר</span>,\" the something, which this <span class=\"font1\">ראשית</span> is supposed to belong to is absent. Nobody is better aware of this than G'd Himself; after all everything emanates from Him.",
                    "A second problem is the fact that the Torah appears to describe the <span class=\"font1\">שמים</span>, heavens, as being the first entity created. Our sages (<i>Chagigah</i> 12) explained the word <span class=\"font1\">שמים</span> as a combination of <span class=\"font1\">אש ומים</span>, \"fire and water.\" This appears as a very daring explanation; it is apt to strenghten the view of those who believe that the beginning of the creative process was the heaven and the earth, but that fire and water had already existed, and that G'd Himself had not created these two elements. If G'd had indeed created the waters, this fact should have been mentioned at the beginning of the items listed as having been created. Our sages were very careful and explained the first verse in the Torah to mean: \"At the beginning of the process of creation of heaven and earth there was a kind of earth which was <i>Tohu Vavohu</i>,\" i.e. in a totally confused state. They did not say that the beginning of the creative process was heaven and earth. I do not believe that their words are sufficiently clear to remove possible errors; why did the Torah afterwards not <b>also</b> mention the creation of water, fire, earth, and wind (the four basic elements of the physical universe)? This in spite of the fact that later on (1,9) the text speaks of G'd commanding the waters to congregate in order that the dry land should become visible. This still is not proof that the waters had been created by G'd. It is much more reasonable to understand that verse as referring to G'd giving instructions to matter, such as earth, which had long been in existence already but which G'd made visible only at that time.",
                    "A third difficulty in the first verse of the Torah is the word <span class=\"font1\">את</span> which precedes both the word <span class=\"font1\">השמים</span>, and the word <span class=\"font1\">הארץ</span>. Why did the Torah need to add these two words?",
                    "Before explaining the meaning of the verse, let me first provide you with a small glimpse of the greatness of the Creator which has been revealed to us. He is able to express in words things which none of His creatures are able to understand. Our sages (<i>Midrash Hagadol</i>) have stated this when they explained Exodus 20,1, the verse preceding the Ten Commandments. The Torah writes: \"G'd spoke all these words saying:\" This refers to words which the mouth (human) is unable to utter and the ear is unable to hear. G'd uttered the entire Ten Commandments in a single utterance, not a single word either preceding or following the adjoining one.",
                    "This brings us to the explanation of what the Torah has written in its first verse. When G'd created the universe and all that is contained therein He did so with a single utterance. This is the meaning of <span class=\"font1\">בראשית ברא אלוקים את השמים ואת הארץ</span>. The reason the Torah added the word <span class=\"font1\">את</span> before the word for \"heaven\" and the word for \"earth,\" was to tell us that all that is contained in either heaven or earth was included in that utterance. The Torah alluded to this so that we should not think that G'd created <b>only</b> the ten items which our sages (<i>Chagigah</i> 12) have enumerated as having been created on the first day and which are discernible by a careful analysis of the first verse. In addition there are many other forces which were created and concealed within basic forces of the universe. Some of these forces we become aware of only through realisation that certain materials are in reality a combination of several elements such as alloys; others we become aware of through the study of climate, astronomy, and other disciplines, i.e. changes that occur in our world as a result of the passage of time, etc. etc. They are far too numerous to list. This is why the Creator has subsumed them all under the two words <span class=\"font1\">את</span> which precede the definition of \"heaven\" and \"earth\" respectively in our verse. You will find that our sages said that the verse commencing with the word <span class=\"font1\">בראשית</span> is to be understood as one of the ten directives by which G'd created the universe (<i>Avot</i> 5,1). If this were not so you would encounter the word <span class=\"font1\">ויאמר</span> only nine times in the story of creation which concludes with Genesis 1,31. As it is G'd created the entire universe with a single utterance; however, the universe lacked order. After having created the universe, G'd proceeded to put order in His universe. This is the meaning of the nine verses each of which commences with the words: <span class=\"font1\">ויאמר אלוקים</span>. These verses introduce the directives which produced order in the universe. On the first day G'd proceeded to separate light from darkness, the first step of creating order in His universe. On the second day He established a division between different kinds of waters.",
                    "You will find proof for the correctness of our interpretation if you look at how the Torah describes the completion of the process in 2,3 where the wording is: \"<span class=\"font1\">כי בו שבת מכל מלאכתו אשר <b>ברא</b> אלוקים <b>לעשות</b></span>,\" \"for on it (the Sabbath) He rested from all His work which <b>He had created</b>, in order <b>to complete it.</b>\" In view of what the Torah had already reported in 2,2, these words would have been quite superfluous unless they wanted to draw our attention to the fact that the act of <b>creation</b> was a comprehensive one all carried out at the very beginning of the first day. The wording of the verse clearly indicates that what occurred during the six days was merely the establishment of order in an existing universe. Perhaps the following example clarifies the matter. An architect wants to build a palace. In order to do so, he first arranges for the various materials such as timber, stone, mortar, cement, etc. to be at hand. Once he has assembled all the components required for his project, he begins the actual construction. When G'd created His universe, He proceeded along similar lines. He prepared all the materials He knew He would require. However, they were all in a confused heap. He then proceeded to put all those various materials in order. ",
                    "When He wanted to create the heavens, for example, He would proclaim: \"Let the sky remain between the waters, etc.\" In other words, G'd assigned a place to the heavens in His universe. The heavens themselves, however, already existed previously. The same holds true for the earth. It too had existed but was only now put in its place.",
                    "There is a reason that the Torah does not specifically <b>mention</b> that G'd assigned a certain place in the universe to fire such as He did to the heavens and to the earth. He did not want to make fire such a powerful source (presence). Had He allowed for fire to be as powerful a presence in the universe as, say the oceans or the earth, the universe could not have been able to endure. This is why G'd left fire in the place it was when He had originally created it, i.e. concealed in the heavens until such time as it is needed by man. At such a time G'd strikes the clouds releasing the required amount of fire from them. Our sages have said that this is the reason we recite the benediction <span class=\"font1\">בורא מאורי האש</span>, \"the One who has created the radiant flames of fire\" at the end of the Sabbath over a candle (<i>Pessachim</i> 54) This is another instance in which G'd demonstrated that basic elements existed in a state of confusion at the time they were created, before G'd had assigned their proper place and function to each one. Had G'd not proceeded in such a fashion the human mind could never have comprehended how different elements could exist within a single mixture, especially such elements as earth and fire which seem to have nothing in common with each other.",
                    "While it is certainly true that had G'd but wanted to, He could not only have created the whole universe at one stroke but could also have established it in the desired order, He had many reasons for not doing so. Our sages have revealed one of these reasons to us when they comment on the above quoted <i>Mishnah</i> in <i>Avot</i> 5,1 that though G'd could have created the universe with a single directive, He wanted to provide additional reward for the righteous who by their deeds maintain a universe G'd had laboured hard to create, or, alternatively, to impose commensurate punishment for the wicked who set out to destroy a universe G'd created with so much effort.",
                    "Do not ask why our sages in the <i>Mishnah</i> use the term <span class=\"font1\">נברא</span>, \"was created,\" (a term normally reserved for creation ex nihilo) when they describe the ten directives used by G'd to \"create\" the world. The fact is that anything which is incomplete in the sense that it lacks something essential is considered as if it did not exist at all. Consider, for example, the earth. As long as G'd had not assigned to earth a place wherein to function so that it was not even visible to other creatures, the term <span class=\"font1\">נברא</span> is justified. The same applies to all other creatures which had not yet been assigned their function by G'd such as the mixture of light and darkness, for instance.",
                    "Do not wonder either why the Torah described the creative process in the manner we have explained instead of saying outright: \"G'd created the waters, the dust the fire and the wind,\" and that would have precluded anyone from misunderstanding the process of creation. Remember that it is the Torah's purpose to inform and reveal all that is hidden in such a way that the power residing in G'd's deeds is revealed thereby to His people.",
                    "He has informed us of the order of creation and its manner as well as the fact that He is mighty and has girded Himself with might and has created the entire universe and every existing thing with a single utterance. This is something that G'd wanted His friends to know; He was not willing to deny us this knowledge because of a few fools who misinterpret what is written in the Torah.",
                    "In addition to this consideration there is another reason that obligated the Torah to report the creation in the order it did. Had the Torah chosen to report the sequence in the manner the fools would have liked, namely that He created the earth and He created the waters, etc., the impression would have been created that He created each element separately, something which does not correspond to the truth. We know that G'd does not like those who utter lies, and that such people cannot endure in His presence. How could He Himself then begin His Torah by telling something that is not so? This is why He spoke the truth about the manner in which the creation took place, and relied on the principle: <span class=\"font1\">כי ישרים דרכי השם צדיקים ילכו בם ורשעים יכשלו בם</span>, \"for the paths of the Lord are smooth, the righteous can walk on them while the sinners stumble on them\" (Hoseah 14,10).",
                    "The Torah's report of creation is designed to overawe us and to induce us to give thanks and recognition to the Creator. If the Torah used the word <span class=\"font1\">בראשית</span> instead of <span class=\"font1\">בראשונה</span>, this is precisely what the psalmist (Psalms 111,6) meant when he said about G'd: <span class=\"font1\">כח מעשיו הגיד לעמו</span>, \"He revealed to His people His powerful works.\" The foregoing teaches that He who is able to call into existence simultaneously a whole universe with a single utterance, without <b>one word</b> having to <b>follow</b> another, also did not require the letters in a word to <b>follow</b> one another. He uttered the letters <span class=\"font1\">ש־מ־י־ם</span> in the word <span class=\"font1\">שמים</span> simultaneously. The same applied to all other words in the directives that G'd issued.",
                    "After G'd has informed us of all this it emerges that these are the things that G'd wished to teach us by means of the word <span class=\"font1\">בראשית</span>. Everything is <span class=\"font1\">ראשית</span>, a beginning; there was not a single thing which came into existence earlier or later than others.",
                    "We must understand that the reason the Lord decided to do things in this fashion -apart from the reasons we have already cited- is that He wanted to reveal to us part of His Omnipotence, something which is embodied in the very name <span class=\"font1\">אלהים</span>. His ability to create the universe in the manner He did, is related to the attribute represented by the name <span class=\"font1\">אלהים</span>. Our sages (<i>Makkot</i> 24) have referred to this aspect of G'd when they told us about the first two of the Ten Commandments, namely the verses commencing with the words <span class=\"font1\">אנכי</span> and <span class=\"font1\">לא יהיה לך</span> respectively. They said: \"We heard these words from the attribute of <i>gevurah</i>, and these lines were spoken as a single utterance.\" What our sages meant was that by employing this attribute G'd can utter many words simultaneously, not only the first two of the Ten Commandments. There are other sources which claim that G'd uttered the entire Ten Commandments as a single utterance. It so happened that there was a special significance for the Jewish people at that time in the first two of the Ten Commandments having been uttered in this way. I have dealt with this subject in greater detail in my commentary on <span class=\"font1\">פרשת יתרו</span>. The important fact is that the Torah uses the name <span class=\"font1\">אלוקים</span> exclusively in its report of the creation. There are powerful reasons why the Torah writes: \"<span class=\"font1\">ברא אלוקים</span>\" as we have outlined.",
                    "<b>2</b>) Let us now approach the word <span class=\"font1\">בראשית</span> from a homiletical (<span class=\"font1\">דרוש</span>) point of view. According to Psalms 33,6: <span class=\"font1\"><b>בדבר</b> ה׳ שמים נעשו, <b>וברוח</b> פיו כל צבאם</span>, \"By the <b>word</b> of the Lord the heavens were made, by the <b>breath</b> of His mouth, all their hosts.\" We must remember that according to our tradition G'd did not create the angels until the second day (<i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 3,11) in order that people should not make the mistake of believing that the angels assisted G'd in the works of creation. We are now faced with the task of reconciling the tradition that the angels were created later than the heavens in view of the fact that the psalmist ascribes the creation of the angels to the \"breath\" of G'd whereas he describes the heavens as having been created by the \"word\" of G'd. Does not the breath of the mouth precede the word that issues forth from the mouth? If so, we are forced to assume that the creation of the angels preceded the creation of the heavens and the earth! In order to resolve this apparent contradiction the Torah wrote: <span class=\"font1\">בראשית ברא</span>, i.e. that G'd reversed the usual order of breath and word by creating with the word although no breath had emanated from His mouth as yet. Thus it was possible to create the heavens first. All of this in order that people should not claim that the angels assisted G'd in His work of creation by stretching the sky over the earth.Since no creature which has been created in accordance with certain rules applying in our universe can act contrary to those rules, <b>only</b> G'd was able to reverse natural processes such as the word of the mouth preceding the breath which helps formulate it. No creature, not even angels, could have assisted G'd in that work. Only G'd is totally free, totally independent of the rules of nature which He has established. This is what the psalmist wishes us to appreciate when he has the <span class=\"font1\">דבור</span> create the heavens though he speaks about \"G'd's breath\" only afterwards.",
                    "In view of the foregoing we must understand the word <span class=\"font1\">בראשית</span> as giving us a clue to the two parts which form a word, <span class=\"font1\">דבור</span>. We have the word itself and the breath which helps the word (formulation of a thought) to be articulated as a word. G'd employed both the word and the breath in order to create. We would not have known with which G'd created the heavens and the earth and with which He created the hosts, i.e. the angels. The Torah tells us that the act of creating heaven and earth came first and from the result you know that the word preceded the breath which emanated from G'd's mouth.",
                    "<b>3</b>) We must appreciate another important difference between the report of creation in Psalms 33,4, and that in the first verse of the Torah. Throughout the whole report of creation in the first chapter of the Torah the word used for G'd is only the word <span class=\"font1\">אלוקים</span>. We encounter the name <span class=\"font1\">י־ה־ו־ה אלוקים</span> only in Genesis 2,4 where the Torah suddenly writes: \"it was on the day the Lord G'd put the finishing touches to earth and heaven.\" You note that in this latter case the Torah mentions the earth first and the heavens afterwards, in contrast to Genesis 1,1, where we were told about the creation of heaven and earth in that order. The other change is that a new attribute of G'd is introduced, the name <span class=\"font1\">י־ה־ו־ה</span>.",
                    "I believe that the answer to the questions raised by this apparent contradiction is found when we view the one verse as providing the answer to a question raised by the other verse and vice versa. First of all, we must look at the source for the system of reward for the righteous and how our sages interpreted this. Concerning this we read in the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20,5): \"He performs kindness to <b>thousands of generations</b>.\" We also read (Deut. 7,9): \"He keeps His covenant faithfully to the <b>thousandth generation</b> of those who love Him and keep His commandments.\" Our sages comment on the fact that in Deuteronomy the Torah limits G'd's reward to one thousand generations, whereas in Exodus the Torah speaks about at least two thousand generations; they also point to the fact that the expression \"to those who keep His commandments\" is not part of the continuation of the thought in the Ten Commandments in the Book of Exodus. [The tone signs on the latter words \"and to those who keep His commadments\" indicate that this is a separate statement. Ed.] In <i>Sotah</i> 31 Rabbi Shimon ben Eleazar points out that though the Torah mentions the words: \"to those who love Me and perform My commandments\" also in the Ten Commandments in Exodus, there is a subtle difference. The words <span class=\"font1\">לאלפים</span> are placed adjacent to the words \"to those who love Me.\" In the case where the Torah promises the reward as extending to \"thousands\" of generations, it refers to the righteous who keep the commandments out of their love for G'd. In the case where the Torah limits that reward to one thousand generations, the Torah speaks about people who observed G'd's laws due to fear of punishment for non-performance. The words: \"to those who love Him,\" are not repeated in the text in Deuteronomy.",
                    "We shall adopt a similar approach in interpreting the apparently contradictory verses in Genesis 1,1 and in Genesis 2,4. As long as the Torah employs G'd's name <span class=\"font1\">אלוקים</span> exclusively, this means that only the attribute of Justice was employed in the work of creation which the Torah reports. All that is reported there took place before G'd \"co-opted\" the attribute of Mercy. This attribute was applicable as far as the creation of the heavens were concerned because the heavens are not inhabited by anyone requiring the attribute of Mercy. This is why the Torah does not again refer to the heavens as it does to the earth in 1,2. In the second report in 2,4, the Torah deals with an earth inhabited by man, a creature composed also of physical matter who therefore cannot endure without the presence of the attribute of Mercy. The word <span class=\"font1\">ושמים</span> at the end of that verse does not belong to the preceding word <span class=\"font1\">ארץ</span> as far as the presence of the attribute <span class=\"font1\">י־ה־ו־ה</span> mentioned in the earlier part of the verse is concerned. Concerning the matter of what preceded which, we have stated earlier that G'd in His omnipotence created the entire universe simultaneously. ",
                    "You, the reader, should not be troubled by Psalms 89,7 in which we read: \"For who in the heavens can equal the Lord, can compare with the Lord <b>among the divine beings.</b>\" Although when looked at superficially, this verse gives the impression that the heavens are inhabited by beings justifiably described as \"gods,\" the Talmud (<i>Baba Metzia</i> 85) reports that Elijah was smitten with 60 firebrands for having revealed some secrets of what goes on in heaven without being authorised to do do. <i>Yuma</i> 77 reports that the archangel Gabriel was similarly punished for an offence. <i>Chagigah</i> 15 tells about Elisha ben Nevuyah (who became a heretic) having observed the angel Mattatron (in the heavens) granting permission for the merits of Israel to be recorded. Elisha assumed that the angel was an independent power, a fact which led to his becoming a heretic. As a result, the angel Mattatron was also smitten with 60 firebrands [to teach us that he too was subject to a higher authority. Ed.] These instances all prove that when the psalmist speaks about the inhabitants of the heaven he does not have in mind \"gods.\" Although angels are not equipped with an evil urge, and we would therefore assume that they cannot sin and become subject to punishment, they still err on occasion -perhaps by not sufficiently concentrating on the task allotted to them- and are held responsible for their errors.",
                    "We have demonstrated that our sages were well aware of the nuances of the text and that the reason the word <span class=\"font1\">שמים</span> sometimes appears after the word <span class=\"font1\">ארץ</span>, whereas other times it appears before the word <span class=\"font1\">ארץ</span>, is in order to show that heaven and earth were created simultaneously. We have also explained why G'd's name <span class=\"font1\">י־ה־ו־ה</span> did not appear until there was a human being. Nonetheless, <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 12,15 states that originally G'd planned to create the entire universe using only His attribute <span class=\"font1\">אלוקים</span>, i.e. the attribute of Justice. According to that tradition He did not co-opt the attribute of Mercy until <b>after</b> He saw that the universe would not endure otherwise. At that time, according to the <i>Midrash</i>, He gave precedence to the attribute of Mercy over the attribute of Justice. [This appears to contradict the notion that the <b>entire</b> universe was created simultaneously. Ed.]",
                    "You should know therefore that G'd has granted permission to interpret the meaning of the verses by our using our intelligence in order to do research, even if, on occasion, the conclusions we arrive at seem to contradict the traditional interpretations of the mental giants of earlier generations. This is the meaning of the rule that <span class=\"font1\">שבעים פנים לתורה</span>, that there are 70 ways to interpret the Torah. As long as our interpretations do not result in halachic rulings which run counter to our traditions we are perfectly within our rights to pursue our own path. This is the reason that the teachers of the Talmud were not at liberty to interpret the Torah in such a way that their halachic rulings would conflict with those of the teachers of the <i>Mishnah</i>. When it comes to the interpretations of the meaning of the written text of the Torah you find that the <i>Amo-ra-im</i> frequently disagree with the <i>Tanna-im</i>, the teachers of the <i>Mishnah</i>.",
                    "After having taken another look at the verses we have discussed I have come to the conclusion that the traditional interpretation and my own conclusions are perfectly compatible. Before explaining how this is possible, we must first explain how the terms \"before\" i.e. what He thought first, and \"after\" i.e. what He thought afterwards, can be used altogether in connection with G'd. G'd's comprehension of things is not comparable to ours, after all. Whereas we need <b>time</b> in order to add to our previous understanding of things, the same surely cannot be said of G'd! It is quite inconceivable that G'd's \"original\" thought would have been incorrect so that He had to re-think His plans for the universe!",
                    "However, you should know that when the sages speak about G'd having \"co-opted\" the attribute of Mercy, such a statement comprises two separate aspects of mercy. One aspect of mercy is that on occasion G'd will apply the attribute of Mercy to someone without even first legally examining any accusation levelled against such a person. This is the true kind of mercy, namely to forgive and to pardon unreservedly. However, the name <span class=\"font1\">אלוקים</span>, i.e. the attribute of Justice, is applicable in instances when He does not want to forgive a person. In such cases He judges him. This is what the sages meant when they asked (rhetorically): \"Is there a human being who does not (legally) have to stand trial?\" A second way of understanding the statement that G'd co-opted the attribute of Mercy after He had created the universe is quite different. We have a tradition that G'd never really <b>waives</b>, <span class=\"font1\">מוותר</span>, any wrong a person has committed. Everyone on earth is being judged, there is no escape from that. Our sages have made this crystal clear when they said (<i>Baba Kama</i> 50) that \"anyone who claims that G'd is a <span class=\"font1\">וותרן</span> will find that his own life will be \"waived.\" The verse quoted to support this is Deut. 32,4: \"The Rock,- His deeds are perfect, Yea, all His ways are <b>just</b>.\" I have chosen to accept the second of these views.",
                    "Accordingly, the manner in which creation proceeded was that intially G'd, i.e. <span class=\"font1\">אלוקים</span>, the attribute of Justice, created. It was G'd's objective that the universe should be able to endure on that basis. When He saw that this would not work, He co-opted the attribute of Mercy. This does <b>not mean</b> that G'd reversed Himself and retreated from His original intention. It means merely that whenever G'd would employ the attribute of Justice to judge man He would temper application of that attribute by using the attribute of Mercy also. Examples of such an application of mercy are that when G'd would find man or mankind guilty of some punishment, the punishment would not be exacted all at once, or would not be levied against all the guilty parties simultaneously, for instance. However, ultimately, no one would escape getting what he deserves. It is this idea the sages had in mind when explaining the attribute of <span class=\"font1\">ארך אפים</span>, that G'd exercises a great deal of patience. ",
                    "As a result of these considerations we understand that had the Torah commenced by writing: <span class=\"font1\">בראשית ברא ה׳ אלוקים</span>, we would have thought that G'd sometimes employs the attribute of Mercy and other times He employs the attribute of Justice. ",
                    "Having explained the meaning of our sages that no one escapes the principle of Justice, but that the application of that principle is <i>often</i> tempered with the attribute of Mercy, we must remind the reader that this tempering applies only in our terrestrial world. In the heavens the application of the attribute of Justice is absolute. When an inhabitant of the Celestial Regions becomes guilty of a misdemeanour, he is not only judged immediately and the judgment is carried out in full, but there is no such thing as remorse, confession, or repentance. Neither is there a plea of having committed the wrong unintentionally. This is part of the point of the story the Talmud recounts in connection with the experiences of Elisha ben Avuya who had entered the <span class=\"font1\">פרדס</span>, i.e. \"preoccupation with esoterics.\" The rabbis had a tradition that there are no favorites in the Celestial Regions, that no one is allowed to sit; everyone must stand, and inasmuch as there is no such thing as fatigue in those regions this is no hardship. When Elisha ben Avuya saw the angel Mattatron seated he arrived at the conclusion that that angel must be a law unto himself. The angel was immediately punished for having caused Elisha to make the kind of error that turned him into a heretic. The angel's failure to rise when he saw Elisha ben Avuya was an unintentionally committed error; he had never been warned about that matter. If a human being had become guilty of such an error G'd would not have punished him in such a fashion.",
                    "<b>4</b>) The fact that the Torah mentions the creation of the heavens first also contains a hint that when G'd builds, He does not do so in the same manner as do human beings. A human builder first lays a foundation before he proceeds to build the upper story of a house. G'd can build the upper stories without having to lay the foundation.",
                    "<b>5</b>) Our sages (<i>Pessikta Zutra</i> ) have also explained the letter <span class=\"font1\">ב</span> in the word <span class=\"font1\">בראשית</span> as meaning \"on account of.\" The word <span class=\"font1\">ראשית</span> stands for the Torah which is referred to as <span class=\"font1\">ראשית</span>. According to that approach the universe was created for the sake of the Torah. This means that anyone who acquires some Torah knowledge acquires the right to enjoy what the universe has to offer, whereas anyone who fails to acquire Torah knowledge does not have the right to derive any enjoyment in this world. Our sages (<i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>) also said that the Torah starts with the word <span class=\"font1\">ראשית</span>, because of Israel who are called <span class=\"font1\">ראשית</span>, as we know from Jeremiah 2,3 where Israel is referred to as <span class=\"font1\">ראשית תבואתה</span>, \"the first of G'd's harvest.\" This statement does not contradict the statement that G'd used the Torah to create the universe, seeing that it is Israel who have to observe the Torah. This is the reason that Israel is also called <span class=\"font1\">ראשית</span>. They distinguish themselves from other nations because of their attachment to Torah. For this reason we have statements that the universe was created for the sake of Abraham, or for the sake of Jacob. The Torah lauds Abraham for having obeyed G'd's voice (Genesis 26,5). Jacob's name was changed to <span class=\"font1\">ישראל</span> which indicated that his very being was a justification for the earth's creation. There are other Midrashic statements according to which the universe was created for the sake of <span class=\"font1\">יראה</span>, fear of the Lord, seeing that David said <span class=\"font1\">ראשית חכמה יראת השם</span> that \"the beginning of all wisdom is a measure of reverence for G'd\" (Psalms 111,10). Since Torah contains the epitome of all wisdom, Israel, Torah, reverence, etc., are really all different sides of the same coin.",
                    "<b>6</b>) Another meaning of the word <span class=\"font1\">בראשית</span> is based on Proverbs 8,30: <span class=\"font1\">ואהיה אצלו <b>אמון</b></span>, which our sages understand as if it said: <span class=\"font1\">ואהיה אצלו <b>אומן</b></span>, \"I will be as a male nurse for him\" (<i>Zohar Terumah</i>). This is again no contradiction to previous explanations. G'd used the Torah much as a mother uses a nurse in order to train the child correctly. This only reinforces the stature of Torah-studying individuals who have been allocated such an outstanding <span class=\"font1\">אומן</span>, trainer or tutor. It is the reason why Torah scholars are called <span class=\"font1\">בונים</span>, builders, in <i>Berachot</i> 64 seeing that what is in their hearts and what emanates from their mouths contributes to the building of a universe such as G'd intended it to be.",
                    "<b>7</b>) The letter <span class=\"font1\">ב</span> in the word <span class=\"font1\">בראשית</span> has also been explained by our sages as an allusion to the two kinds of <span class=\"font1\">יראה</span>, reverence, or fear of punishment. Fear of G'd may be due to fear of being punished for misdeeds, or it maybe due to a feeling of awe and reverence for the grandeur of G'd, something our sages call <span class=\"font1\">יראת הרוממות</span>. This latter <span class=\"font1\">יראה</span> is a morally much higher category than mere fear of punishment. Both these fears are alluded to in the latter <span class=\"font1\">ב</span>. G'd had to create both these kinds of fear in order to assure the universe of continued existence. The first kind of fear is alluded to in the use of the word <span class=\"font1\">אלוקים</span>, the attribute of Justice, the second by the use of the name <span class=\"font1\">י־ה־ו־ה</span> in the verse where <span class=\"font1\">שמים</span> is mentioned last. This corresponds to the commentary on Psalms 8,4: \"when I behold Your heavens, the work of Your fingers\" (I become awe struck with <span class=\"font1\">יראת הרוממות</span> as mentioned in verse 2 in that chapter).",
                    "Alternatively, the word <span class=\"font1\">ארץ</span> with its connotation of the here and now inspires fear, whereas the word <span class=\"font1\">שמים</span> which makes one think of something supernatural evokes feelings of reverent admiration for its creator.",
                    "<b>8</b>) An allusion of a more esoteric nature may be found in the word <span class=\"font1\">בראשית</span> when we understand the letter <span class=\"font1\">ב</span> as an allusion to <span class=\"font1\">בית</span>, house. According to this, <span class=\"font1\">יראת השם</span> is the home of the <span class=\"font1\">שכינה</span>, presence of G'd. When someone possesses the appropriate awe and reverence for the creator of Heaven he is fit to harbour the <span class=\"font1\">שכינה</span> within his person. This is the deeper meaning of Isaiah 33,6: <span class=\"font1\">יראת ה׳ היא אוצרו</span>, \"Reverence for the Lord is His treasure-chamber.\" This is also the meaning of Psalms 78,60: <span class=\"font1\">אהל שכן באדם</span>, \"He set a tent amongst men.\"",
                    "<b>9</b>) The word <span class=\"font1\">בראשית</span> may also be understood in the same vein as the statement in <i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 35,5 that \"the sword and the book (Torah) descended to earth one wound around the other.\" This is another way of saying that \"with <span class=\"font1\">בראשית</span>, i.e. the Torah, G'd created, i.e. brought the attribute of Justice into the universe.\"",
                    "<b>10</b>) In Kings I 18 39 the Jewish people exclaimed <span class=\"font1\">השם הוא האלוקים</span>, i.e. they understood that G'd comprises these two attributes. This meant that they were aware that the attribute of Justice is complemented by the attribute of Mercy. Not only that, but they realised that all G'd's attributes comprise also the attribute of Mercy as an integral, though minor part. [Rabbi Isaiah Horowitz in his <span class=\"font1\">שני לוחות הברית</span> elaborates on that theme. Ed.] After having given due consideration to the guilt or otherwise of a person, the judgment is administered by the attribute called <span class=\"font1\">מדת הדין</span>. This aspect apart however, the name <span class=\"font1\">אלוקים</span> suggests that G'd's intention when creating the universe was to bestow blessing on His creatures. When Isaac blessed Jacob (believing that Esau stood in front of him) he invoked the attribute of <span class=\"font1\">אלוקים</span> when calling down the blessings of \"the dew of the skies and the fat parts of the earth.\" He had been well aware of the attribute <span class=\"font1\">י־ה־ו־ה</span> when he referred to it just one verse prior to the blessing we have just mentioned (Genesis 27,27-28). The difference between using these two attributes lies in the fact that the attribute <span class=\"font1\">אלוקים</span> bestows G'd's kindness on those who deserve it, whereas the attribute of <span class=\"font1\">י־ה־ו־ה</span> bestows such blessings even on those who do not deserve it.",
                    "<b>11</b>) We find a further meaning of the word <span class=\"font1\">בראשית</span> in the aggadah (<i>Bet Hamidrash</i> Yalinek 3,50) which depicts the various letters of the alphabet approaching G'd, each one asking to be accorded the privilege that the Torah should begin with it. Each letter presented a cogent argument, all of which were examined by G'd. All the claims were rejected by G'd in favour of the letter <span class=\"font1\">ב</span>. The only letter which had not made a claim was the <span class=\"font1\">א</span>. G'd promised the <span class=\"font1\">א</span> to become the first letter of the alphabet because it had not pressed its claim. We can deduce from this that the letter <span class=\"font1\">א</span> possessed a valid claim to superiority, and if it had pressed its claim the Torah would indeed have commenced with that letter. It is also peculiar that in that aggadah the letters are described as having pressed their claim starting with the last letter, i.e. <span class=\"font1\">ת</span>. Why did the aggadah not list the letters as pressing their claims in their normal order, starting with the letter <span class=\"font1\">א</span>? If that had been the case G'd would not have accepted the claim of the letter <span class=\"font1\">ב</span> before the letter <span class=\"font1\">א</span> had even had a chance to present its argument. You must appreciate that when the letters in the alphabet appear in their normal order, i.e. <span class=\"font1\">א־ב־ג</span>, this is an allusion to the attribute of Mercy, whereas when they appear in the reverse order such as <span class=\"font1\">ת־ש־ר</span>, this is indicative of the attribute of Justice. To remind you that this is indeed so, look at the letters in the name <span class=\"font1\">תשרי</span>, the first month of the year. The early part of that month is reserved for the attribute of Justice, hence the letters in the name of that month allude to that. It is only because G'd always complements the attribute of Justice with the attribute of Mercy, that He added the letter <span class=\"font1\">י</span> to the name of that month. Having explained this, you will understand that the appearance of the letter <span class=\"font1\">ב</span> in front of the letter <span class=\"font1\">א</span> in the word <span class=\"font1\">בראשית</span> hints at the fact that the world was created primarily by the attribute of Justice. The letter <span class=\"font1\">ב</span> is in its appropriate place then.",
                    "<b>12</b>) Another meaning of the word <span class=\"font1\">בראשית</span> is related to the tradition that G'd created 1000 worlds corresponding to the meaning of the letter <span class=\"font1\">א</span>. These worlds, however, remain hidden. They are usually referred to as <span class=\"font1\">עלמין דכיסופין</span>. These worlds are alluded to in the verse <span class=\"font1\">האלף לך שלמה</span>, \"You can have your Thousand, Solomon\" (Song of Songs 8,12). Since the letter <span class=\"font1\">אלף</span> therefore had already been allocated its place (in those 1000 worlds), it is quite in order for the report of the creation of <b>this visible world</b> to commence with the second letter, i.e. the letter <span class=\"font1\">ב</span>. Since this world consists of two parts, i.e. heaven and earth, this is alluded to in a report which commences with the letter <span class=\"font1\">ב</span> which has a numerical value of 2. The reason the word is not <span class=\"font1\">בראשונה</span>, is to avoid the impression that the heavens preceded the earth during the creative process.",
                    "<b>13</b>) Another meaning contained in the words commencing with <span class=\"font1\">בראשית</span> is an allusion to the four kinds of world G'd created, i.e. the <span class=\"font1\">עולם האצילות, עולם הבריאה, עולם היצירה</span>, and the <span class=\"font1\">עולם העשיה</span>. The fact that there are 4 such worlds is alluded to in Isaiah 43,7: <span class=\"font1\">כל הנקרא <b>בשמי ולכבודי, בראתיו, יצרתיו, אף עשיתיו</b></span>. \"Everything that has been called forth for the sake of My Name, (1) in My honour, (2) I have created it, (3) I have fashioned it, (4) and I have completed it.\" The world of <span class=\"font1\">כבוד</span> is an allusion to <span class=\"font1\">עולם האצילות</span>, whereas the other three expressions for G'd's creative acitvity in that verse are self-explanatory. In our verse (Genesis 1,1) the four worlds are represented by 1) <span class=\"font1\">ראשית</span>, 2) <span class=\"font1\">ברא</span>, 3) <span class=\"font1\">אלוקים</span>, <b>4</b>) <span class=\"font1\">את השמים ואת הארץ</span>.",
                    "<b>14</b>) Yet another meaning of the word <span class=\"font1\">בראשית</span> is that it alludes to the tradition (<i>Pessachim</i> 54) that (the concept of) Paradise and Hell, i.e. <span class=\"font1\">גן עדן וגהנם</span> were created prior to the creation of the physical universe. This means that G'd had to establish the idea of reward and punishment in advance of the creative process. These two concepts are referred to in the word <span class=\"font1\">ב־ראשית</span>, i.e. \"two beginnings.\" The reason for the emphasis on the \"2\" is that 2 places are reserved for each human being, one in Paradise and one in Hell. It depends on him which place he will ultimately occupy. In either event, if he occupies a place in either domain he will also be accorded the second place, i.e. the one left vacant by a fellow human being who has forfeited it. The reason that the <span class=\"font1\">ב</span> is appended may also be to teach us that these two concepts came into existence simultaneously.",
                    "<b>15</b>) Another reason for the letter <span class=\"font1\">ב</span> (meaning 2) preceded the word <span class=\"font1\">ראשית</span> is the fact that G'd created two worlds, i.e. the <span class=\"font1\">עולם הזה</span> and the <span class=\"font1\">עולם הבא</span>. When man preoccupies himself with the study of Torah and the performance of good deeds (to his fellow human beings) he will attain the ultimate good, i.e. eternal life in the <span class=\"font1\">עולם הבא</span>. The Torah therefore alludes already at its very outset to the fact that the reward for proper conduct in this world is stored up for enjoyment in the second world, the <span class=\"font1\">עולם הבא</span>. In that world most of the reward will be paid to the <span class=\"font1\">נשמה</span>, the soul. If man has qualified for additional reward he will receive that in this world. The reason the Torah mentions the heavens first is to teach us that G'd is concerned with assuring us of our share in the \"higher\" world first.",
                    "<b>16</b>) Another reason for the word <span class=\"font1\">בראשית</span> as the opening word of the Torah may be connected with the well known dispute between Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua about whether the universe was created in Tishrey or in Nissan (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 10-11). I believe that both sages were correct. Our sages are on record that G'd first conceived of a plan to create the world, whereas He carried out His plan sometime later. We may therefore assume that G'd conceived of the plan in Nissan, whereas He executed it in Tishrey, or vice versa. The term <span class=\"font1\">ברא</span>, He created, would be appropriate for both stages of creation, the planning stage as well as the stage of execution. When G'd conceives of a plan it is equivalent to executing it. The letter <span class=\"font1\">ב</span> in the word <span class=\"font1\">בראשית</span> then indicates that the process of creation had two beginnings, 1) its planning, 2) its execution. The only thing the sages debated was whether the planning stage or the executive stage occurred in Nissan or Tishrey respectively.",
                    "<b>17</b>) Our sages (<i>Berachot</i> 6) state that anyone who possesses <span class=\"font1\">יראת שמים</span>, reverence for G'd, will have his requests heard (answered) by G'd (based on an inverted reading of Kohelet 12,23). The reason is that such a person speaks from the depth of his soul when he addresses G'd. The same is not the case when prayer emanates from the body, i.e. some of the physical attributes of man such as his lips, his tongue, etc. We have previously mentioned (8) that the word <span class=\"font1\">ראשית</span> alludes to fear of the Lord. Once one has acquired this, G'd listens to one's words and teaches man understanding, i.e. how to lead the proper life on earth, i.e. <span class=\"font1\">ואת הארץ</span>.",
                    "<b>18</b>) G'd has commanded man to cultivate numerous kinds of \"fear,\" <span class=\"font1\">יראה</span>. He is to fear father and mother (Leviticus 19,3). He is to fear the king as well as the Rabbinic authorities. He is to be afraid not to create the impressions amongst his peers that he is sinful. In short, there is hardly an aspect of life when man does not have to be in awe of someone or something. This makes it almost impossible not to become guilty at one point or another of slighting G'd's command by failing to properly respect the king, the parents etc..In order to warn us to be very careful about this, the Torah starts with a word alluding to <span class=\"font1\">יראה</span>. We are to first practice <span class=\"font1\">יראת שמים</span>, reverence for G'd Himself, in order to train ourselves to develop the appropriate reverence for earthly creatures. When the Torah says in Numbers 32,22: \"<span class=\"font1\">והייתם נקיים מה׳ ומישראל</span>,\" the meaning is that you first have to practice reverence vis-a-vis G'd in order to also practice it successfully vis-a-vis human beings where appropriate. Unless one does not transgress the commandment to relate to G'd with due reverence it is impossible to fulfil the subordinate command to relate to human beings with the proper degree of respect.",
                    "<b>19</b>) Another allusion found in the word <span class=\"font1\">ראשית</span> with the prefix <span class=\"font1\">ב</span> is the fact that G'd created two distinct spiritual levels in human beings by means of the Torah. Man can achieve a spiritual level approximating that of Heaven as we know from Psalms 82,6: <span class=\"font1\">אני אמרתי אלוקים אתם</span>, \"I said: you are divine beings,\" or, in the event man does not maintain his spiritual level he descends to earth. Both possibilities are alluded to in our verse.",
                    "<b>20</b>) The entire paragraph dealing with the creation of the human species alludes to the fact that man was the principal objective of the entire universe. The word <span class=\"font1\">בראשית</span> then means that when G'd started to create man He began with his divine qualities, his Heavenly source <span class=\"font1\">השמים</span> as well as with his physical source <span class=\"font1\">הארץ</span>. Our sages understand Psalms 50,4: <span class=\"font1\">יקרא אל השמים מעל</span> as a reference to man's spirit, whereas they understand the subsequent words <span class=\"font1\">ואל הארץ</span> in the same verse as a reference to the earth that man's body is made of. The message of the verse is that by means of man's deeds it is possible for him to transform the material he is made of to such a high spiritual level that it will be considered as a <span class=\"font1\">צורה</span>, an idealised form, a symbol rather than mere matter.",
                    "We have a tradition that bodies of truly righteous people do not turn into dust upon their deaths since the materials their bodies are made of have already been refined to such an extent that they have become spiritualised (based on Rabbi Yitzchak Arama who explained in chapter 32 why the term <span class=\"font1\">מיתה</span> is not used by the Torah in relation to Jacob). This is why our sages say that the righteous are called <span class=\"font1\">חיים</span>, alive, even when they have departed this earth. This is so because even their physical parts have become spiritualised, maintaining contact with eternal life. The wicked, on the other hand, are considered as already dead even while they are still alive within their bodies. Even the spiritual part of their beings is reduced to being merely physical, i.e. mortal, inert. ",
                    "Both of these possibilities are alluded to in the very first words of the Torah when the Torah speaks of G'd having created \"<span class=\"font1\">את השמים ואת הארץ</span>.\" The Torah means that man has the choice of belonging to either part of the universe.",
                    "When the Torah describes the earth as having been <span class=\"font1\">תהו ובוהו</span>, this is also a description of what happens when the spiritual part of man declines and mixes with the merely physical part. When Onkelos translated these words as meaning \"empty and dark,\" he referred to earth being devoid of any spiritual input. It is a reference to a situation where only the evil urge holds sway. Our sages describe the evil urge as \"darkening the face of the open places.\" In that context the body is called <span class=\"font1\">תהום</span>, \"the deep,\" meaning that it swallows up everything. The body itself is also compared to the <span class=\"font1\">תהום</span>, due to the evil urge consuming all that is light. The spirit of G'd, i.e. the source of spiritual input, was described as merely \"hovering\" above this expanse of the deep waters as it had not yet found a suitable resting place, the evil urge resisting its attempts to do so. ",
                    "This state of affairs continued until G'd issued the directive: \"Let there be light.\" When man is born a similar situation exists in the relationship between body and spirit until, at the beginning of his fourteenth year, G'd equips him with the <span class=\"font1\">יצר הטוב</span>, the spiritual force that can counter his evil urge. He receives an infusion of a holy soul. Another way of understanding the simile intended by our verse is that the light that the Torah describes as having been created on the first day is the Torah itself which was added to the existing mass. It is called <span class=\"font1\">אור</span>, just as Solomon has called the Torah <span class=\"font1\">אור</span> (Proverbs 6,23). G'd dispatches the soul which is hewn from beneath His throne in the Heavens, and which represents some part of the Divinity to provide spiritual light for man so that he will not drown in the muck of the evil urge. Alternatively, you may view this as the Torah which provides spiritual illumination for the soul of man. Once G'd created that illumination He saw that the light He had provided for man was good because by means of that light man chose to walk the path of goodness and uprightness. [The foregoing must be understood against the author's remarks that man was the objective of the creation; hence every part of the creative process was designed to prepare the way for man's existence. Ed.]",
                    "Do not believe that the provision of such a pure and holy soul or even preoccupation with Torah is an automatic recipe for a life undisturbed by the machinations of the evil urge to tempt you to engage in sin. If this were so the whole concept of reward and punishment would be meaningless. This is why the Torah mentions that the light notwithstanding there is still (spiritual) darkness in the world. The function of the light is to assist man in his struggle against the forces of the <span class=\"font1\">יצר הרע</span>, Satan. It is designed to establish lines of demarcation, to enable one to recognise when one is being seduced, to identify what precisely is sinful and wicked. This is why the Torah continues (1,4) that G'd made a division between light (the soul) and darkness (the forces of evil). This is what Solomon meant when he stated (Kohelet 10,2): \"The heart of a wise man is on his right,\" i.e. the site illuminated by the light of the soul, whereas \"the heart of the fool is on the left,\" the site of the evil urge. \"G'd called the light 'day', whereas He called the darkness 'night;'\" this is why David prayed that G'd should save him from the terror of the \"nights,\" i.e. the evil urge.",
                    "The Torah goes on to say: \"it was evening, it was morning, one day,\" to teach us that it is impossible to distinguish the light represented by the holy soul except when contrasted with the darkness of the evil urge. Were this not so there would be no substantive difference between human beings and the ministering angels, just as there would be no room for such concepts as reward and punishment. This is the reason the Torah speaks about <span class=\"font1\">יום אחד</span>, \"one day.\" ",
                    "This is in line with the explanation of the sages <i>Shabbat</i> 30 on Song of Songs 1,3: <span class=\"font1\">על כן עלמות אהבוך</span>, \"this is why the young maidens love you.\" They understand the verse as a metaphor describing Torah scholars and dividing the word <span class=\"font1\">עלמות</span> into two words <span class=\"font1\">על מות</span>, \"even unto death,\" forcing even the angel of death to acknowledge their purity through their martyrdom. When applied to our verse, the meaning is that even the <span class=\"font1\">ערב</span>, the attribute of almost-darkness as much as the attribute of light itself will become part of the overall light called \"day.\"",
                    "Another meaning of the statement \"It was evening, etc,\" could be that it is an allusion to the power of the presence of the holy soul which enables man at the time of \"evening,\" i.e. a time when there is confusion between the forces of light and the forces of darkness to emerge successfully to the higher world, the world identified with the word <span class=\"font1\">בקר</span>, \"morning.\" Our sages have said that the condition of the soul upon its return to Heaven at the end of man's life on earth should should be <span class=\"font1\"><b>כיום</b> בואה</span>, as on the <b>day</b> it entered the body. The simile is presumably based on Kohelet 12,7: <span class=\"font1\">והרוח תשוב אל האלוקים</span>, \"And the spirit returns to the Lord.\"",
                    "<b>21</b>) The first verse of the Torah may have yet another meaning. It is to inform us that at the beginning G'd established earth as equal to heaven in spite of the fact that the heavens are the \"upper\" parts of the universe. Nonetheless, the earth started out by being pure. We need no other proof for this than that man was created from earthly materials. Once he had been created the angels even mistook him for a divine being until they realised that man required sleep (<i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 8,9). Not only that, G'd chose to have His residence on earth, sharing it with His creatures, preparing a house on earth for His \"rest,\" so to speak. It is obvious that G'd's \"home\" must be perfect and sacred. Prior to Adam's sin G'd was as much at home on earth as He is in Heaven nowadays. All of this is part of the meaning of the words: \"At the beginning G'd created heaven and earth.\" They shared many of the same properties as far as purity is concerned, etc. Isaiah 66,1 alluded to this when he said: \"The heaven is My throne and the earth My footstool.\" Evidently earth was an abode fit for G'd Himself. It is only the deeds performed by people on this \"lower\" part of the universe that caused Tohu Vavohu to become an integral part of earth. [The author understands the word <span class=\"font1\">היתה</span> (1,2) as a development which followed creation of heaven and earth instead of as a condition which preceded the creative process. Ed.] The earth then became something tangible and opaque, hence dark. Once G'd directed that light should come into existence, i.e. that Torah should be given to its inhabitants, earth returned to its pristine state, capable of dispensing spiritual light, a place fit for G'd to dwell in together with His people.",
                    "<b>22</b>) There is a further dimension to this first verse of the Torah. We have it on the authority of Solomon in Kings I 8,12 that G'd chooses to dwell in a thick cloud. We also have a tradition (<i>Taanit</i> 5) according to which G'd swore an oath that He would not make Himself at home in the celestial Jerusalem until He was able to make His home in the terrestrial Jerusalem. This is convincing evidence that G'd's love for earth is even greater than His love for heaven.",
                    "When we examine the reason for the creation of the entire universe we must conclude that our part of the universe is its very core. Israel are G'd's people and His \"inheritance\" (Deut. 32,9). The style of our verse then is what the sages call <span class=\"font1\">לא זו אף זו קתני</span>, \"that the less important item is mentioned first, the author proceeding towards the most important part in an ascending order.\" This is why the word <span class=\"font1\">השמים</span> precedes the word <span class=\"font1\">הארץ</span> in our verse. The heavens, so to speak, were only a necessary prerequisite for the earth. Earth, of course, attains its importance due to becoming the home of the Jewish people. The Jewish people are the key to the continued existence not only of earth but of the heavens as well. Students of kabbalah are well acquainted with this interdependence of heaven and earth. ",
                    "Once we appreciate this concept we can understand the Tohu Vavohu as an allusion to the periods when Israel are in exile, and when due to that fact they prevent G'd from occcupying His residence on earth. Israel's first exile was in Egypt where they spent a period of 430 years (Exodus 12,40). This number corresponds to the numerical value of the letters in the words <span class=\"font1\">תהו ובהו</span>, Tohu Vavohu. The meaning of the word <span class=\"font1\">ובהו</span> also contains an allusion to another exile, the Babylonian exile. The very word <span class=\"font1\">בבל</span>, Babel, means \"empty\" i.e. <span class=\"font1\">בהו</span>. Jeremiah describes the exile in Babylonia (Jeremiah 51,34) by depicting king Nebuchadnezzar as devouring Israel and setting it down like an <b>empty</b> dish. When the Torah continues <span class=\"font1\">וחשך על פני תהום</span>, this is an allusion to the present exile which is as endless as the \"deep.\" Not only is this exile of such long duration but the word <span class=\"font1\">חשך</span>, darkness, alludes to two dimensions. 1) Our subservience to the nations of the world, the discriminatory burden of taxation which leads one to having the feeling that one is surrounded by darkness. 2) The burden of the evil urge which has darkened the universe, and through our many sins many members of our people have become loose tongued, spreading gossip, sins which are obstacles to one's becoming a <span class=\"font1\">בעל תשובה</span>, a truly penitent person. We must not allow ourselves to blame the \"times,\" i.e. our circumstances and resultant despair for this deterioration in our own spiritual standards. They are not the <b>cause</b> of all this for G'd has said: <span class=\"font1\">יהי אור</span>, \"let there be light.\" ",
                    "The author of <i>Tikkuney Ha-Zohar</i> has pointed out that the numerical value of the word <span class=\"font1\">רז</span>, secret, is the same as the numerical value of the word <span class=\"font1\">אור</span>, light. The light referred to in our verse is the light of redemption. G'd decreed that this light shall remain hidden until it will be revealed by the Messiah. In the interval until then it will remain hidden like a treasure. Concerning the time when this light will be revealed G'd has said: \"I have revealed it to My heart but My heart has not revealed it to My mouth.\" The Torah continues: \"He saw the light that it was good. The light itself is good, not just the function it performs. Hail to the eye who has set eyes on that light. [the words <span class=\"font1\">את האור</span> were unnecessary, the Torah could have simply written: <span class=\"font1\">וירא אותו</span>, \"He saw it.\" Ed.]The repetition of the word also confirms that G'd saw that He had done well to conceal this light for the time being. According to the <i>Midrash</i> the words \"and the spirit of G'd hovered over the expanse of the water,\" refer to the spirit of the Messiah waiting until the waters i.e. Torah have performed their task. Israel will not be redeemed except through the merit of Torah study (and performance) (<i>Pessikta Zutra Va-etchanan</i> 4 32). The Torah has been compared to water (<i>Shir Hashirim Rabbah</i> 1,19).",
                    "Students of the kabbalah are well aware that in this terrestrial world many sparks of holiness are drowned in the <span class=\"font1\">קליפות</span>, secular, impurity infested matter. At the same time a great deal of <span class=\"font1\">ערב רב</span>, opportunists masquerading as holy men, have infiltrated the circle of truly saintly people, as has been pointed out by the <i>Tikkuney Ha-Zohar</i>. In our times the division between the holy and the profane has become blurred. This is why G'd will have to make a clear separation of good from evil and light from darkness all of which have become mixed up with one another. It is also well known that the ability of the <span class=\"font1\">קליפה</span> to remain \"alive\" is totally dependent on its ability to be nurtured by a holy source. The moment such a holy source dries up the <span class=\"font1\">קליפה</span> has nothing to sustain it and to keep it alive. Therefore, when G'd separates the light, i.e. holiness, and evil remains totally isolated, it will have no source whence to sustain itself and will disintegrate of its own accord. This is what the prophet (Zecharyah 13,2) referred to when he said: \"I will remove the spirit of impurity from the earth.\" The process is similar to the cutting off of a tree's trunk from the source from which it derives its sap, from its roots. It will wither and not bloom again. The only thing that will be left at that time will be the light which is good. When the Torah said: <span class=\"font1\"><b>ויקרא</b> אלוקים לאור יום</span>, we must understand the word <span class=\"font1\">ויקרא</span> as if it were derived from <b><span class=\"font1\">יקר</span></b>, precious. The superiority of holiness over profanity is recognisable only when that which is profane, i.e. the <span class=\"font1\">קליפה</span>, otherwise known as darkness, is demolished. The prophet said that on that day, a day known only to G'd, G'd will declare the light truly precious and great. This will be the day of which it has been said (<i>Zecharyah</i> 14,9) that \"G'd and His Name will be One.\"",
                    "When the Torah says: <span class=\"font1\">ולחשך <b>קרא לילה</b></span>, \"He called the darkness night,\" the word <span class=\"font1\">קרא</span> is reminiscent of the expression <span class=\"font1\"><b>מקרה</b> לילה</span>, a nocturnal seminal emission (Deut. 23,11), something which confers ritual impurity both on the person himself and those in contact with him. The reason that word is not connected to what was written previously, [it would have been more appropriate for the Torah to continue <span class=\"font1\">וקרא לחשך לילה</span>, \"<b>and</b> He called the darkness night.\" Ed.] is to alert us to the fact that darkness no longer has any value in itself and exists only incidentally, i.e. <span class=\"font1\">מקרהו</span>. Once the night, i.e. the period of exile, has passed -as alluded to in Isaiah 21,11 <span class=\"font1\">משא דומה</span>, \"an apparent burden\"-as soon as the morning dawns there will be no more darkness and no more night. At such a time the message inherent in the words: <span class=\"font1\">ויהי ערב ויהי בוקר יום אחד</span>, that the period previously known as almost-dark will have become part of the light, part of the \"day,\" will be fulfilled. This is the allusion contained in the verse from Zecharyah we quoted earlier \"<b>on that day</b> G'd and His name will be One.\"<br>[I suspect that the reason the author divided his commentary on the Torah's report of the first day of creation into 22 separate sections is to allude to the Hebrew alphabet which contains 22 letters. It is his way of showing that all these letters had their part in the opening of the story of creation. Ed.]"

The Torah should have concluded that utterance with the usual \"it was so.\" Furthermore, it appears to me that once the Torah reported G'd as having made the sky, i.e. <span class=\"font1\">ויעש אלוקים</span>, there was certainly no need for the Torah to end the verse with <span class=\"font1\">ויהי בן</span>.",
                    "I believe therefore that there were three separate activities performed all of which involved the sky. First of all, the sky itself as a distinct entity had to be formed; this occurred on the first day as part of the creation of the universe by G'd's first utterance. ",
                    "Secondly, the sky had to stretch itself in response to G'd's command for it to effect a separation between the \"upper\" and the \"lower\" waters. Our sages call this the <span class=\"font1\">וילון</span>, curtain. G'd intructed the sky as to exactly what dimensions it was to consist of. This is the instruction given in verse six.",
                    "The third activity became necessary due to the heavens being spherical. They are shaped in such a way that they are curved downwards. While it is true that the directive to separate the \"upper\" from the \"lower\" waters included that the sky was to perform the function of a curtain, this did not specify whether that curtain was to be horizontal or otherwise. This is why the Torah reported that G'd completed the installation of that curtain in the manner familiar to us as an upside down bowl. The Torah had to report again that G'd separated the sky because He had installed the sky in an inverted manner. If the sky was to prevent the \"upper\" waters from descending and joining the \"lower\" waters, we would have expected the shape of the sky to be the regular bowl with its edges turned upwards. The fact that our eyes perceive a (sky) horizon which turns down at the edges is so remarkable that the Torah had to allude to the fact that G'd arranged it in this way. ",
                    "The miraculous part of this stage of the creation then was that it demonstrates forces at work which are the very opposite of what we perceive to be natural law. When the Torah added the words <span class=\"font1\">ויהי כן</span>, this was confirmation that the plan worked, that the sky stayed in place and achieved its function of separating between the \"upper\" and the \"lower\" waters. An alternative reason for the words <span class=\"font1\">ויהי כן</span> at the very end of the paragraph may simply be that the Torah wanted to wait with reporting this till the process had been completed.",
                    "After having written this commentary, I have come across an explicit verse in Isaiah 42,5 which confirms that my understanding of the creation of heaven and earth is accurate. The prophet describes the work of the Creator in these words: \"He creates the heavens and stretches them out, He spreads out the earth and what it brings forth.\" The act of creation and the act of stretching out the heavens are described as <b>separate</b> activities. This corresponds to our statement that whereas on the first day G'd created the universe, He put it in place on a subsequent occasion, i.e. the second day. This \"stretching out\" again consisted of two separate stages.",

Why did the Torah have to report an activity, i.e. <span class=\"font1\">ויעש</span> in this instance, why was a mere directive such as <span class=\"font1\">ויאמר</span> not adequate for the occasion? Do we not have a verse (Psalms 33,6) which states that the heavens and all their hosts were created by an utterance of G'd? If Ben Zoma had been aware of our interpretation he could have remained perfectly calm about this problem.",
                    "There is another approach to this problem in line with my commentary about the next verse i.e. \"let the waters gather together, etc.\" There are two kinds of waters, male and female waters. In view of the fact that these waters were in a complete state of confusion much like the confusion which existed between light and darkness, a little light here, a little darkness there, G'd had to separate the male waters from the female waters just as He had to separate light from darkness. As a result, the \"upper\" waters are the ones we consider the male waters, whereas the ones described as the \"lower\" waters are the female variety. G'd is therefore reported as having instructed the sky to make two separations. The sky's initial task was to make the waters identifiable. The second task of the sky was to ensure a permanent separation between the male \"upper\" waters and the female \"lower\" waters by interposing itself between these waters. This is evident from the words: \"between the waters\" in verse six. The Torah reports <span class=\"font1\">ויהי כן</span> to indicate that both purposes had been achieved."

On the third day G'd told the \"lower\" waters to be gathered into one area in order for the dry land to become visible so that the inhabitants of earth would have where to live. This concept does not contradict those sages who claim that the \"upper\" waters are only held in place by a miracle, because even though the sky carries those waters it still required a miracle to arrange and organise the heavens and everything connected with it. We explained this in connection with verse seven."

                    "<b> <span class=\"font1\">ויאמר אלוקים יקוו המים</span>. G'd said: \"Let the waters congregate to one area, etc.\"</b> We must first determine whether the Torah refers to the waters which had previously been described as <span class=\"font1\">תהום</span>, \"the deep.\" Once G'd said that the waters should gather into \"one\" place we must assume that no other area remained for these waters. This however, would contradict Exodus 20,4 where the Torah speaks about <span class=\"font1\">המים אשר מתחת לארץ</span>, \"the waters which are beneath the earth.\" If the waters in our verse are other waters, not the ones described previously as <span class=\"font1\">תהום</span>, we must understand in which way they were separate and different from the waters of the <span class=\"font1\">תהום</span> to justify the fact that G'd addressed them separately. Besides, there is no reference to G'd having addressed some specific water; G'd simply gave a general directive for the waters to gather to one place. This applied to all existing waters. Another problem is why visibility of the dry land was made dependent on the waters gathering to one place? The word <span class=\"font1\">ותראה</span>, it shall become visible, is itself difficult. Why did the Torah not simply say: \"and as a result there will be dry land?\" ",
                    "We can explain all these details by falling back on what we said at the outset, namely that G'd had already created the entire universe on the very first day and had only assigned each part of the universe its proper place and function by means of the various directives mentioned in the Torah. Accordingly, we know that \"the dry land\" extended within the waters all across the universe. It was covered by water above and water beneath. The sky separated those waters which had covered the dry land from above, \"carrying\" half on its \"wings\" so to speak. This is why the Torah spoke about the sky being <span class=\"font1\">בתוך המים</span>, \"inside\" the waters. Ordinarily, the meaning of the word <span class=\"font1\">תוך</span> is <span class=\"font1\">אמצע</span>, in the middle. G'd then addressed the other \"half\" of the waters which still covered the dry land telling it to gather in one place, i.e. the oceans, in order for the dry land to become visible in the very place it had been since it had been created. It had acquired its proper place there already at the time of creation. All G'd did at this stage was to decree that it should become visible.",
                    "Perhaps the meaning of the word <span class=\"font1\">תראה</span>, become visible, also contains a reference to colouration. One of the reasons the dry land had not been visible may have been that it was of the same colour as the water, making the boundaries between water and dry land difficult to discern. The word <span class=\"font1\">תראה</span> may also include a connotation of suitability, i.e. <span class=\"font1\">ראוי</span>, suggesting that the dry land was suitable for and indispensable to the inhabitants of the earth.",
                    "Yet another meaning of the word <span class=\"font1\">תראה</span> may be that as long as the dry land was surrounded by water both above and beneath it had no assurance that it would endure as a separate entity. The waters threatened to make it disintegrate. Maimonides writes at the beginning of <span class=\"font1\">הלכות דעות</span> [in our editions chapter 4 of <span class=\"font1\">הלכות יסודי התורה</span> Ed.] that water is apt to make the element of dust disintegrate. In order to prevent this from happening G'd directed that the waters be contained in one place, i.e. that the power of water be limited. The purpose of the directive then was to assure the continued existence of the dry land and to enable it to perform the function intended for it. We may also deduce from the wording of the directive that <b>not all</b> the waters in the universe gathered to become part of the oceans. There remain areas called <span class=\"font1\">תהום</span> beneath the earth.",
                    "It is possible that there is no basic difference between the waters which congregated, i.e. followed G'd's directive, and those that remain beneath the earth. The statement of our sages that G'd said <span class=\"font1\">די</span> to earth means it should not extend from one end of the universe to the other, but that the waters beneath the earth should remain in contact with the waters in the oceans.",
                    "After I had written all this I found a <i>Midrash</i> in <i>Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer</i> which states: \"On the third day the earth was completely flat. The waters covered the whole expanse of the earth. When G'd uttered His command that the waters should congregate in one area, hills and mountains made separate appearances all over the earth. This caused the waters to retreat and to gather in one mass. This <i>Midrash</i> proves again that at the time G'd gave the directive the earth, i.e. the dry land already existed as a body. The only difference, according to the comment of <i>Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer</i> and mine is, that according to the former the word <span class=\"font1\">תראה</span> means that it was earth, i.e. the dry land, which established boundaries for the waters. It was the waters which were assigned their place. This corresponds to Jeremiah 5,22 which speaks about G'd using the sand to hem in the oceans. According to this view the word <span class=\"font1\">תראה</span> is derived from <span class=\"font1\">ירא</span>, to fear, and the meaning of G'd's directive was to inspire fear in the waters. The whole verse in Jeremiah reads as follows: <span class=\"font1\">האותי לא תיראו נאום השם, אם מפני לא תחילו אשר שמתי חול גבול לים, חק עולם ולא יעברנהו</span>. \"Should you not revere Me,- says the Lord; should you not tremble before Me Who set the sand as a boundary to the sea, as a limit for all time, not to be transgressed? This interpretation is different from my own. It is homiletical, whereas my interpretation is <span class=\"font1\">פשט</span>, based on the plain meaning of the text.",
                    "Nachmanides understood the word <span class=\"font1\">תראה</span> to mean that whereas previously water and earth were mixed up, i.e. the waters had been murky, G'd decreed at that time that they should separate and that the earth (dust) should rise so that it should become visible above the waters. His commentary is not <span class=\"font1\">פשט</span>, seeing one has to presuppose that until that time the waters had been inextricably mixed with the earth, something which is not supported by the text. Besides, according to Nachmanides there would have been no need for the waters to congregate in one area, it would have sufficed for the Torah to state that the dry land should become visible. The earth should have been addressed, not the water. If the dry land would have \"flooded\" the water, the water would simply have remained in its place. Besides, it is quite clear from the text that all those waters under the sky which were adjoining the earth were to assemble together, something that did not occur according to the interpretation of Nachmanides. Furthermore, the use of the word <span class=\"font1\">ותראה</span> would be quite inappropriate according to his approach. I therefore prefer my own interpretation.",
                    "It appears to me that all the categories of water on earth, both those that are are called the \"upper\" waters, i.e. the ones above the sky, as well as the waters which gathered to one place in response to G'd's directive are all of the male kind. This is why you find that the waters of the oceans actively promote growth of plants as our sages have said when they defined rain as vapour rising from the oceans, forming into clouds and descending on earth to impregnate it to produce plants. According to these same sages, the subterranean waters rise up to meet the waters from above and between them \"fertilisation\" takes place. Our sages (<i>Taanit</i> 28) phrased it thus: \"Every single drop of rain that descends from above is met by two drops of subterreanean water which rise towards it. The whole process of water contributing to growth is equated with the mating of living creatures. This teaches that when the waters from above the earth or the waters from below the earth act alone they are unable to achieve their role of promoting growth. This is what the sages meant when they said that there are two kinds of water, the male and the female. When the Torah describes how the waters became more and more turbulent during the deluge it appears they became stronger as soon as the \"male\" waters from above joined the \"female\" waters below (compare Genesis 7,19: <span class=\"font1\">והמים גברו <b>מאד מאד</b></span>)."

Prior to the development on the third day the waters which had now congregated had also been part of the <span class=\"font1\">תהום</span> as long as \"earth\" had not become visible.

Is it not an <i>a fortiori</i> that if concerning the trees which are not normally growing a motley growth this instruction is applicable, the same must apply even more so to us. They went ahead and came forth each according to its own kind. When the angel heard this he recited the verse in Psalm 104 quoted above. This statement in the Talmud attributed to Rabbi Chanina is difficult seeing that according to the sequence mentioned in our verse G'd gave His directives to the herbs <b>before</b> He gave directives to the earth concerning trees. Surely the herbs did not delay carrying out G'd's directive until the trees had grown? If one accepts our thesis that G'd created the entire universe at one and the same time on the first day, the question we just posed does not need to trouble us. We stated there that <b>all</b> the directives were uttered as a <b>single</b> utterance. The problem of a \"before\" and \"after\" therefore does not concern us."

The earth brought forth herbs, etc.</b> Since the Torah had told us already at the end of the previous verse <span class=\"font1\">ויהי כן</span>, that the earth had carried out G'd's directive, what need was there for this entire verse? The Torah wanted to inform us of two new phenomena, one concerning the herbs and one concerning the trees. We already mentioned the <i>a fortiori</i> of the herbs, that they emerged each according to its kind without having been specifically commanded to do so. The reason the Torah considered this information important for us may be to teach us not to crossbreed different kinds of herbs in accordance with the opinion of Ravina in <i>Chulin</i> 60. The following is the text of the Talmud there: \"What is the law concerning someone who has crossbred herbs according to the view of Rabbi Chanina? Will he not be considered guilty because G'd never instructed earth to produce the herbs according to their kinds, or, is the fact that G'd agreed with the reasoning of the herbs, evidence that such a person should be held culpable? The Talmud leaves the question open. Rashi comments on that passage that the reason the question is posed only according to the view of Rabbi Chanina is that the Rabbi held that the herbs did what they did of their own volition, not because they had been so commanded. If Rashi is correct, it follows that the sages thought that all other rabbis considered that G'd had commanded the herbs to come forth only in accordance with their respective species even if the Torah did not specifically spell this out. Those rabbis draw the conclusion that what the Torah stated in verse 12, namely that the herbs came forth according to their species is proof that already in verse 11 the <b>intention</b> had been for this rule to apply also to the herbs. According to Rabbi Chanina, however, verse 12 was the reason the herbs reasoned as they did, realising that G'd had indeed wanted them also to adhere to the rule of not growing in a motley fashion. If the Torah had not written verse 12, we would not have known anything about this and how the herbs arrived at their decision, even though verse 11 concluded with the statement <span class=\"font1\">ויהי כן</span>. This verse may serve us as a model for other verses in which the Torah appears at first glance to repeat what appears to have been stated previously.",
                    "Verse 12 also informs us that the earth did not carry out G'd's directive to produce fruit-bearing trees whose trunk would also be edible. Earth did not fully comply with G'd's instructions but only produced fruit-bearing trees, not edible trunks.",

Our sages have not proven anywhere that earth has an evil urge! At best, the sages attributed such urges to animals when they are found kicking. I have dealt with that subject in its appropriate place. At any event, we have no evidence that earth possesses such an urge which would seduce it to carry out acts of rebellion against G'd.",
                    "Another matter which we need to investigate is where the ordinary trees come from. The Torah does not report instructions that earth should produce <span class=\"font1\">אילני סרק</span>, non fruit-bearing trees, trees whose function is merely to provide wood. Nonetheless, we find far more such trees on earth than fruit-bearing trees. We are forced to conclude that prior to the earth being cursed all trees were of the fruit-bearing variety, and that the capacity of the earth to produce fruit-bearing trees diminished after the earth was cursed. It could no longer produce only fruit-bearing trees, but produced thorns and thistles in their place.",
                    "We know from Proverbs 3,19 that \"G'd founded the earth with wisdom and the heavens with insight,\" that the earth is intelligent. Earth understood G'd's directive to produce fruit-bearing trees that continue to produce fruit as meaning one of two things. 1) The taste of the trunk itself should equal that of the fruit, in which case the tree itself had to be edible. 2) The absence of a connecting letter <span class=\"font1\">ו</span> i.e. <span class=\"font1\">עץ פרי ועשה פרי</span> in the wording could mean that G'd wanted trees that could be eaten and that these trees should in addition produce another kind of fruit. The earth reasoned that if G'd had wanted the tree itself to taste like its fruit the letter <span class=\"font1\">ו</span> would have been necessary to connect the two statements. The expression <span class=\"font1\">עץ פרי</span> could also mean one of two things. 1) A tree which itself is a fruit. 2) A tree which is capable of producing fruit without being a fruit itself. In its eagerness to respond to G'd's directive earth produced all the three categories that it deemed G'd could have had in mind. Firstly, it produced trees that produce fruit, but whose trunk is not edible. Secondly, it produced fruit whose taste is similar to that of their trunks. The tree of knowledge was one such tree. Our sages are on record [based on the wording of Genesis 3,6 that \"the woman saw that <b>the tree was good as food</b>\" Ed.] that the taste of that tree itself was like that of its fruit. Thirdly, the earth produced trees which resembled fruit-bearing trees. These are the ones known as <span class=\"font1\">אילני סרק</span>, trees that bear no fruit. The manner in which verse 12 describes the earth's response reflects the earth's speed in complying with G'd's directive. There was no element of insubordination at all. The addition of the letter <span class=\"font1\">ו</span> in front of the words <span class=\"font1\">עץ עשה פרי</span>, a letter which was quite unnecessary, is a hint that in addition to the other trees the earth also produced a tree whose trunk tasted like its fruit. That letter <span class=\"font1\">ו</span> may also allude to the other non fruit-bearing trees that the earth produced. According to this interpretation the curse of the earth at a later stage was not due to its having ignored part of G'd's directive at this stage. I will come back to that curse in due course."

G'd said: \"Let there be luminaries.\"</b> The reason that the Torah employs the singular <span class=\"font1\">יהי</span> instead of <span class=\"font1\">יהיו</span> when speaking about a number of luminaries is that the Torah already alludes to the fact that one of the luminaries would have a separate function, namely to \"shine\" by day, whereas all the others illuminate the night. Had G'd employed the plural at that stage when the sun and moon were still of equal size He could not have changed the size of the moon afterwards without reversing Himself. G'd's directives must endure forever.",
                    "The Torah speaks about the function of the luminaries being to distinguish between day and night. If the luminaries were equal in power how could that objective be achieved? The luminary by day would provide just as much brilliance by day as the luminary designed to function at night would provide. How then could we distinguish night from day? The wording of the Torah proves that the moon had to be a far weaker luminary than its counterpart by day and that this had been the plan at the outset..",
                    "Clearly, the wording is based on the fact that the luminaries along with everything else had come into existence already on the first day. The report of G'd's activities on that first day includes the mention of <span class=\"font1\">אור</span>, light, five times. Our sages said that this is an allusion to five different kinds of light which G'd created on that day. He separated them for the sake of His inheritance (Jewish people) for the righteous in the future. Now, on the fourth day, He took enough from this light to illuminate the universe and suspended it in the sky of the heavens. The meaning of the words <span class=\"font1\">יהי מארות ברקיע השמים</span> then is \"Let <b>some of</b> the luminaries be in the sky of the heavens.\" The letter <span class=\"font1\">מ</span> is understood as \"part of.\" G'd added the condition that these luminaries should not remain stationary but should revolve around the universe in order that by means of their movements people could distinguish day from night.. He did this in order to ensure that the Jewish people would know which days are Holy Days, i.e. <span class=\"font1\">לאותות ולמועדים</span>. When G'd provided this illumination He separated two units from one another, each of which was intended to serve by day. This is the deeper meaning of the argument of the moon (reported in <i>Chulin</i> 60) that it is impossible for two kings to wear the same crown. The moon referred to the fact that both were to \"rule\" at one and the same time. Had the moon originally been intended to illuminate by night, how could the aggadah have used the simile of \"two kings and one crown, i.e. simultaneously?\" We must therefore understand this aggadah as assuming that each luminary was assigned a different part of the day. The Torah's wording which refers to these luminaries as <span class=\"font1\">והיו למארות ברקיע השמים להאיר על הארץ</span>, without the addition of specific times when this function is to be performed supports our theory."

Their light is to penetrate as far as the earth itself down below. An additional meaning of the text seems to be that the power of the light be such that it illuminate the sky and that the light which spreads along the horizon will illuminate earth. Earth itself is unable to tolerate the power of direct illumination from the luminaries. We derive this by carefully looking at the words <span class=\"font1\">למארות ברקיע השמים</span> \"(they will be) as luminaries in the sky of the heavens,\" which describe the region where these luminaries are to function. The Torah then goes on to say: <span class=\"font1\">להאיר על הארץ</span>, \"to spread light on the earth.\" This is a reference to the bright light already provided by the above-mentioned luminaries in the heavens.",

The statement in <i>Yuma</i> 28 that on a cloudy day the sun (its light) is diffused throughout the universe does not contradict our words. Even though the sun may be forced to emit its rays \"sidewards,\" there is still a difference between the sun being in its regular place from which it emits more powerful rays of light than when said rays have to make a detour sideways. The part of the sun which would normally shine directly on earth and whose path is blocked by the clouds will instead be deflected heavenwards. This is the meaning of a \"cloudy day is all sun\" which is how the Talmud <i>Yuma</i> 28 phrases its conclusion."

By day the moon does not enjoy any rule at all in the presence of the sun's light. G'd assigned the stars to serve as satellites to the moon. This does not represent a reversal of the previous order, as the Torah had already provided allusions concerning the ultimate scheme of things at the outset."

What they meant was that these luminaries do not illuminate the world because the world is entitled to their light. If that were the case, the luminaries would withdraw their light anytime people on earth do not conduct themselves as worthy of it. Our sages illustrated this point when they quoted Moses himself (in the Hereafter) after the destruction of the Temple as rebuking the sun for not withholding its light as a protest at the time the enemy entered the Holy of Holies. G'd therefore told us that ever since the luminaries were presented as a gift to the world they were no longer independent creatures, and were forced to act in accordance with the tasks allocated to them. This also explains why the Torah once again repeats the words <span class=\"font1\">למשול ביום</span>, to rule by day (1,18), something that was already stated as an objective in 1,16 above. They (<i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 6,9) therefore understood this verse to refer to the righteous who in the future will rule in the domain that the light has been removed to, in order to shine as effectively by day as by night. The plain meaning of the verse is that there was a need for the Torah to again state that the luminaries were <b>to rule</b> by day and by night to tell us that their function was to be permanent and not subject to withdrawal for any reason because they are required to give of their light.

The Torah here adds the words <span class=\"font1\">ואת כל נפש שרץ חיה</span>, \"and all the crawling living beings that the waters spawned,\" instead of just reporting that \"the waters produced according to their kinds,\"- as in the case of the earth producing herbs. The words <span class=\"font1\">למיניהם</span> were restrictive. Neither the earth which was charged to produce vegetation, nor the waters which were charged to produce swarms of crawling living creatures and birds which could fly were able to produce anything which was not part of their own constitution, the potential they had been equipped with. Since neither the waters nor the earth contain the element <span class=\"font1\">רוח</span>, wind, spirit, breath, for instance, how could they possibly bring forth a creature that possessed <span class=\"font1\">רוח</span> as an essential element? Although both earth and water possess some minute life-giving ability, this would never be enough to produce living organisms such as fish and birds. This is why G'd is reported in our verse as having supplied this additional life-force. This is why the Torah here has to once again use the term <span class=\"font1\">ויברא אלוקים</span>, G'd created. This involvement of G'd extended to <span class=\"font1\">כל נפש חיה</span>, every living creature. Although G'd had previously directed the waters to produce swarms of crawling living creatures, the meaning of that directive was to produce a swarm of bodies which was capable of being animated through the infusion of a life-force to be supplied by G'd. This was something that was well within the capacity of the waters to produce.",

When G'd gives a directive merely by word of mouth, the Torah has to report that G'd's directive was carried out.

Also, why did G'd allow a spirit of jealousy to develop <b>even</b> amongst the various creatures produced from the waters such as the flying insects which are not reported as having been blessed? I believe this was part of the very nature of the creatures that came into existence as \"swarms.\" The command to produce \"swarms\" called for a one time act of creation not an ongoing process. G'd ordered these creatures to be fruitful and to multiply in order to ensure the survival of the respective species. Had G'd not blessed them they would have perished. The ability to procreate is linked to the element fire, warmth. Cold, on the other hand, is liable to destroy that reproductive ability of the species. Fish, which live in a cold environment, therefore needed an additional blessing to protect their reproductive organs against damage by the cold that is part of their habitat. We can learn about this both from the scientists as well as from what our sages have told us about Abraham's dialogue with G'd, reported in <i>Shabbat</i> 156. Abraham had assumed that his fortunes had been guided by the planet Jupiter, i.e. <span class=\"font1\">צדק</span>. <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 43, discusses this in detail in connection with Isaiah 41,2. According to the Talmud, G'd remonstrated with Abraham when the latter said that he knew from his astrological observations that he was not slated to have children. G'd challenged this when He told Abraham that such horoscopes do not control the destinies of Jews. He demonstrated His power over the planets by switching Jupiter from a position in the Western sky to one in the Eastern sky. This is the deeper meaning of Isaiah 41,2 asking rhetorically: \"Who has enlightened him from the East, He (G'd) called <i>Tzedek</i> to be at his (Abraham's) feet?\" This incident illustrates that sometimes G'd has to interfere- in this case by directing a blessing- in order for nature not to be counterproductive. Without this blessing the fish would have died out because they would have tried to escape the inhospitable climate they found themselves in by coming ashore where it is warmer.",

Teaching mankind this concept was so important to G'd that He did not mind that some heretics might use this wording as a pretext to claim that there were partners who helped G'd create either man or the universe. G'd's humility consisted also of the fact that He, personally, took the dust, formed it into clay, and blew the breath of life into Adam.

Even though the Torah does not specifically mention man's dominion as extending over \"the waters\" [but only to the seas Ed.], this may be because it is already alluded to in the words <span class=\"font1\">בדגת הים</span>, i.e. that man's dominion extends over the oceans.",

The Torah lists the various categories of creatures man has dominion over to warn us that he would be punished by his soul eventually being reincarnated in the body of one of these lesser creatures if he were not morally fit to exercise this advantage he has been granted. At the same time, the awareness of the potential loss of such powers should act as an incentive to man to regain his former stature in the event he has sinned. The Torah begins with describing the potential descent of man's soul to being reincarnated as a fish. This is why the fish are mentioned first in the list of creatures over which man has dominion. Inasmuch as fish may be killed in any fashion and do not require ritual slaughter to make them fit for consumption by Jews, anyone who has the misfortune to be reincarnated as a fish at least does not have to undergo the pain involved when said fish is killed. A more painful loss of human dignity is to be reincarnated as a bird. Birds have to undergo partial ritual slaughter before they become fit for consumption by Jews. The next and still more serious loss of human dignity is to be reincarnated as a mammal which cannot become fit for consumption by Jews unless it has both the windpipe and the gullet severed. When the verse continues and speaks about <span class=\"font1\">כל הארץ</span>, this is a reference to the vegetation on earth, or even to inert parts of nature itself. Here the Torah alludes to the path of man's return to his former stature by mentioning parts of nature which may be consumed by Jews without their having to undergo a painful experience such as violent death. There is, however, an even greater descent of man into the abyss, i.e. utter destruction beyond a chance of rehabilitation. This occurs if man is reduced to the category of <span class=\"font1\">שקצים ורמשים</span>, insects and reptiles.

They believe that when there are three or four brothers in a family that only one or two of the brothers need to practice procreation in the mistaken belief that this comprises fulfilment of the commandment to be fruitful. Sometimes even when there is only one son in the family, he ceases to perform this commandent after he has fathered a number of children. In order to prevent such faulty thinking, the Torah lists the duty to procreate as the very first commandment and also adds the word <span class=\"font1\">רבו</span>, multiply, to disabuse us of the idea that the commandment is limited to siring a certain number of children.

We must therefore understand the word <span class=\"font1\">את</span> in the line <span class=\"font1\"><b>ואח</b> כל העץ</span> as a restrictive clause. Another meaning could be that even the tree of knowledge was included. If man had waited till the onset of the Sabbath, he could have eaten from that tree also as he would have used its grapes to recite the benediction over the Sabbath. The prohibition to eat from that tree which the Torah mentions later was not meant to be a permanent prohibition, it meant only that use of its fruit was to be for a holy purpose only."

The word <span class=\"font1\">לאכלה</span>, \"as food\" is repeated next to the words <span class=\"font1\">כל ירק עשב</span>, all the green plants, which appears to indicate that the mammals and the birds were to eat only grass.

Should you say that in the absence of grass the animals would die, the Torah says <span class=\"font1\">לכם יהיה לאכלה <b>ולכל</b> חית הארץ</span>, \"it will be as food for you <b>and</b> for all the beasts of the earth.\" As a result we find that man was to sustain himself from all the fruit of the earth and from the fruit of the trees, whereas the animals were to feed on the grass and the vegetables. Should there be a dearth of the latter, the animals too could feed on the food intended for man. There is an allusion to this in Deut. 11,15: \"I shall give grass in your fields for your animals and <b>you</b> will eat and be satisfied.\" Unless there are exceptional circumstances, you the human being will not experience satiation from the food intended primarily for your animals; neither will the animals find your kind of food satisfying."

Without the presence of the human species what pupose would the whole universe have served? The goodness of all G'd's work would not have been evident to anyone. Man alone is able to evaluate that something is good and to acknowledge it as such. The Torah here adds the word <span class=\"font1\">והנה</span>, an expression which has not been used previously when G'd's review of a day's work was described as good. The reason that the Torah restricts the \"good,\" or \"very good\" respectively by the addition of the restrictive <span class=\"font1\">והנה</span>, \"as of the present\" is, that now that there existed a human being there also existed the chance that this human being would disturb the harmony of the universe by his actions.

It appears that we must understand it in the context of the saying of our sages that G'd is the <span class=\"font1\">מקומו של עולם</span>, G'd is the place of His universe (and not vice versa). We also find statements to the effect that G'd fills the universe, such as Isaiah 6,3: \"The whole earth if full of His glory.\" G'd's light surrounds the entire globe and it fills the globe itself. We need to understand why G'd has arranged things in this manner. I have heard from Torah scholars (who were my teachers) that the reason G'd made the earth spherical is to enable its various parts to endure with equal ease. The rabbis meant that of all the desires, urges and feelings of love in the universe nothing matches in intensity the urge of the spirit which has recognised the light of G'd and its desire to cleave to G'd's light. Every living soul which has been fortunate enough to recognise even a small amount of that light longs to behold visions of the pleasantness that is G'd. Know that G'd has endowed each category of His creatures with a two-tiered intelligence. One tier is the power to perceive, the other tier is the power to analyse. Human beings, i.e. creatures who are endowed with the power of speech, as well as all lower forms of life or even the inert part of nature, all received a degree of intelligence commensurate with their status in the universe which enables them to recognise their Creator. By means of this intelligence we know that the globe continues to exist without faltering. G'd has revealed some of this secret to those who revere Him and by means of these explanations these facts became translated to our senses [as opposed to merely abstract intelligence. Ed.] The force holding up the globe is G'd's beautiful and all-embracing light which surrounds the globe in equal measure. Every section of the revolving earth derives additional strength from the power of the fiery urge that burns within it urging it to cling to the manifestations of G'd's spirit. This is why the globe remains in its position in the universe. [I have abbreviated the author's treatise on what he terms spiritual motivations for keeping \"earth on track.\" I have no way of knowing if the author was familiar with Newton's theories about centrifugal forces, gravitation, etc. Even assuming that he had heard of them, the chances are he would have preferred to account for these movements as having been inspired at least also by spiritual considerations rather than as being <b>merely</b> laws of physics. According to the author the reason for the Torah telling us something at this stage which seemed obvious is to explain the fact that spherical earth which is not propped up by a visible force could remain in place throughout the millenia.

It also means that G'd did not only desist from work on that Sabbath, but that He did not resume activity on the following six days.",

Our sages already felt the need to correct the impression that G'd had still performed creational work on the seventh day. Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, quoted by Rashi and <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 10,9, says that human beings who do not know time accurately commence their Sabbath a few minutes early in order not to desecrate it. G'd who is aware of precisely when the Sabbath starts, can afford to do His work until the last second. Even allowing for Rabbi Shimon's comment, the word <span class=\"font1\">ביום</span> in that verse is not adequately explained. This word creates the impression that G'd ceased work on the seventh day. Actually, according to our sages the word <span class=\"font1\">ביום</span> is justified. ",

On the seventh day G'd gave the earth <span class=\"font1\">מנוחה</span>, tranquillity (compare Rashi's second comment on our verse). On the Sabbath G'd created the \"soul\" of the world, and that is the deeper meaning of the words <span class=\"font1\">וביום השביעי שבת וינפש</span>, and on the seventh day He rested and retreated to His Essence. Although our sages have interpreted the word <span class=\"font1\">וינפש</span> as a lament about the withdrawal of the additional soul G'd grants to the Jewish people on each Sabbath (<i>Beytzah</i> 17) this is merely homiletics. They base that on the unusual construction <span class=\"font1\">וינפש</span> (passive or reflexive) instead of merely, <span class=\"font1\">ונפש</span> (ordinary intransitive). The plain meaning is undoubtedly that <span class=\"font1\">שבת וינפש</span>, because He rested on the Sabbath and with it the soul arrived. This means that all creatures were granted an abundance of vitality, something they had lacked previously.",

The word <span class=\"font1\">ויכל</span> therefore refers to activity carried out previously. All that had been lacking was something that would give permanence to this universe of ours. The seventh day, i.e. the Sabbath, completed the cycle that provides this permanence. We are therefore entitled to view the Sabbath as one of the <b>seven</b> days of creation. The proof that we are correct may be the very fact that we do not find the usual: \"it was evening it was morning the seventh day,\" meaning there was no <span class=\"font1\">בריאה</span> on that day.",

                    "Perhaps we have to explain these words in connection with <i>Pessachim</i> 54 according to which there were phenomena which were created at dusk on Friday afternoon but which could not be completed before the arrival of the Sabbath. According to our sages some of these phenomena became destructive agents in the universe as a result. This is an amazig statement in view of the tradition that G'd is able to create whole worlds in the time it takes to blink an eyelid! How can one suggest that the Creator ran out of time and was unable to complete His work?! We have explained already at the beginning of the <span class=\"font1\">פרשה</span> that G'd created every part of the universe simultaneously. The words <span class=\"font1\">מכל מלאכתו</span> suggest that G'd did not complete even such work as was already in progress.",
                    "What our sages had in mind when they told us about these phenomena and the time they were created is that G'd wanted us to know something about the importance of the Sabbath and the way it is to be observed. Halachah distinguishes between the rules of what is allowed on Friday afternoon close to the Sabbath and what is not. If work has been under way and it awaits only completion there are certain categories of work which may be completed under such circumstances, especially if they are performed in honour of the Sabbath or if financial loss is suffered if one does not complete the work before the Sabbath. If such work has not even been commenced it may not be undertaken until after the Sabbath. In the example in <i>Pessachim</i> the sages taught us that G'd desisted from completing even work He had already begun while it was still the sixth day. This in spite of the fact that non-completion would result in grievous loss to the universe, a loss which was beyond retrieving. This is what the word <span class=\"font1\">וישבות</span> alludes to after we had already heard <span class=\"font1\">ויכל</span>, that G'd completed creating. Not only did G'd not undertake something new, He did not even complete something that was in the process of coming into being. The reason this word is repeated is also to tell us that it was not G'd's inability to complete an undertaking on time. One of the reasons G'd's activities on each day during the days of creation are always followed by the statement \"it was evening, it was morning, etc.,\" is to mark the contrast with the Sabbath concerning which no such statement is recorded."

Our sages (<i>Mechilta</i> Exodus 20,3) suggested that the blessing was the fact that while the Jewish people were in the desert an extra portion of manna descended on Fridays and they did not have to pick it up on the Sabbath. Such allusions are, of course, not the plain meaning of the verse. The plain meaning of the verse has nothing to do with isolated events two and half millenia in the future. ",

Although the amenities of this \"lower\" world are not normally attained through asceticism, withdrawal into the four walls of the Torah academy, etc., but through preocccupation with the profane and the mundane, G'd provided His blessing so that not only would there be no lack of the physical comforts but an abundance. This abundance is expressed by the halachah requiring us to have two whole loaves of bread when reciting the benediction over the Sabbath meal, to eat at least three meals on that day, and to enjoy delicacies not eaten on the days of the week. One might have expected the blessing to be of a purely spiritual nature. By not mentioning a spiritual kind of blessing, the Torah alludes to the Sabbath having been endowed by G'd with blessings of a physical nature.

                    "<b><span class=\"font1\">כי בו שבת</span>, for on it He rested, etc.</b> Here too we must explore exactly what the Torah had in mind. We fall back on what we wrote earlier, that the world had lacked the ingredients which assured it of permanence until the Sabbath came into existence. Assuming that this was so, we must ask what had enabled the world to continue up until the Sabbath? Since the world obviously was able to carry on without the <span class=\"font1\">נפש</span> it received on the Sabbath, why would its continued existence have been endangered only then?",
                    "We find that G'd has revealed the answer to this question in the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20,11) where the Torah writes: <span class=\"font1\">כי ששת ימים עשה השם את השמים ואת הארץ</span> This means that at the time G'd created the universe He invested it with only enough power to endure six days for reasons known only to Himself and some kabbalists. G'd created one day which would be able to invest the world with staying power for another six days. If G'd had not created the Sabbath, the Tohu Vavohu preceding those six days would have returned and G'd would have had to start the process of creation ex nihilo all over again. Due to the infusion of the \"soul\" of the Sabbath the universe was placed on a more permanent basis, enabled to renew its batteries, so to speak. The words <span class=\"font1\">ובו שבת</span>, mean that by means of this special day, the Sabbath, He was able to rest from all <b>His work</b>. The work referred to is that which only G'd could perform namely to create ex nihilo, something out of nothing. Had it not been for the Sabbath and its <span class=\"font1\">נפש</span>, G'd would have had to repeat the process of <span class=\"font1\">בריאה</span>, creation. The word <span class=\"font1\">עשה</span> refers only to <span class=\"font1\">תיקון</span>, improvement, repair. G'd rested from both aspects of creative activity.",
                    "When viewed in this light we can understand the statement of our sages that by reciting the benediction over wine on the Sabbath one becomes a partner to G'd in His creation of the universe (<i>Shabbat</i> 119). At first glance these words appear very forced. Who has ever heard of man becoming a retroactive partner in G'd's handiwork, something that He had long since completed? Besides, the act of reciting this paragraph from the Torah does not appear to be such a world-shaking effort that it would qualify us to become G'd's \"partners!\" What is the source of the statement in the Talmud? If the sages meant that the reward for reciting Kiddush is so great, should it not be awarded in public such as longevity, wealth, and physical prowess being granted to Sabbath-observers?",
                    "When we keep in mind my explanation thus far, it will be seen that the Talmud's statement is indeed most appropriate. In view of the fact that the Sabbath provides a secure existence for the six days following it after which another Sabbath repeats the same function, it follows that the very existence of the Sabbath equates with the existence of the universe. Unless there are people who observe the Sabbath there is no Sabbath, i.e. its existence has lost its meaning. Our rabbis have legislated that when one's life is in danger unless one desecrates a law of the Sabbath, one should desecrate a single Sabbath in order to remain alive and observe many subsequent Sabbaths. Assuming that there were no other Sabbath-observers at the time, what good would it do for the person whose life was in to skip the one Sabbath? The world would disintegrate before he would have a chance to observe another Sabbath! It follows that only Sabbath-observers keep the universe going. Therefore the Sabbath-observers have become G'd's \"partners\" by ensuring that G'd's universe survives for another six days. Observing the Sabbath means to preserve its holiness according to all its laws and customs. Ever since the creation of man the world did not lack at least one person who observed the Sabbath. Adam did so, his son Sheth, and many righteous people after him. Whenever one righteous person died, G'd had already arranged for another righteous person to be born. This chain of individual Sabbath-observers continued through Methusela, Noach, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, etc., until the Jewish people introduced collective Sabbath-observance. According to our sages, The Israelites observed the Sabbath even while in exile in Egypt (<i>Shemot Rabbah</i> 1,32). The word <span class=\"font1\">בהבראם</span>, when they were created, is the reminder that whatever the earth or the waters produced was possible only due to the act of creation G'd performed on the day they were created themselves.",

Were it not for the Sabbath, no creature would have had sufficient intelligence and desire to want to cleave to the Creator. On that day they were provided with the potential to produce what they produced subsequently."

The verse also tells us that the living creatures on earth were G'd's creation as indicated by 2,19, that \"G'd formed all the beasts of the field.\" Earth's contribution was to provide the golem-like body pending G'd's infusing these bodies with a breath of life. The same applied to the swarms of \"living\" creatures produced by the waters as well as the birds. Our sages have already stated that the birds are the result of co-operation by water and earth, i.e. swamps (<i>Eyruvin</i> 28).

If the Torah only wanted to inform us that the raw material man is made of was the dust of the earth, it could have done so in 1,27 where man's creation by G'd is reported instead of repeating the whole story about man being created.",

Our sages therefore believed that just as the principle of donating the first of the dough to the priest in his capacity of G'd's representative on earth is a duty, creation itself is morally bound to \"donate\" to its Creator something similiar. We find the following passage in the tractate <span class=\"font1\">חלה</span> 2,5: \"If someone sets aside the quantity of <span class=\"font1\">חלה</span> that he is obliged to set aside in the form of flour (instead of as part of the dough), it (this quantity of flour) is not considered sacred.\" In 3,1 of the same tractate we are told that until the dough (of wheat) has developed so that the meal and the water form one body, a non-priest may still eat of it on an ad hoc basis, even if <span class=\"font1\">חלה</span> has not yet been set aside from it. If one eats from such dough subsequently (knowingly) one is guilty of the death penalty. The descent of rain on the vegetation of the earth is akin to the mixing (kneading) of a dough from which to make bread. This is why consumption of the proceeds of grain i.e. bread or cake, is prohibited until <span class=\"font1\">חלה</span> has been set aside. It is equivalent to what the <i>Mishnah Challah</i> 3,1 called <span class=\"font1\">גלגול העיסה</span>. Earth was unable to produce viable vegetation without G'd contributing the rain. It follows that it is prohibited to eat or otherwise enjoy any of earth's fruit until an appropriate gift to G'd has been set aside. The creation of man [from raw material made of all parts of the earth Ed.] was that gift, i.e. that <span class=\"font1\">חלה</span>. Prior to man's creation the earth was <span class=\"font1\">טבל</span>, untithed produce, forbidden, out of bounds to man. This is what our verse wanted to convey. Although earth produced the plants on the third day, G'd had not provided the rain at that time, not until immediately before He formed the human being. Creation of man, i.e. the <span class=\"font1\">חלה</span> of the universe, enabled all the creatures to enjoy it henceforth. The Torah mentions that the entire surface of the earth was irrigated because if G'd had irrigated only parts of the earth, such an incomplete \"dough\" would not have freed the remainder from the requirement to contribute further amounts of <span class=\"font1\">חלה</span>.",

After having given us this information the Torah continues and tells us that G'd made all kinds of trees grow from the soil, that these trees looked attractive and were good as food, that G'd made rivers and the function of those rivers which emanated from <span class=\"font1\">גן עדן</span>.

The Torah therefore is at pains to make us understand that the garden was planted exclusively for man's sake and awaits man's return at a suitable time in the future and that no other creature inhabits it in the meantime."

G'd took man…to work it and to guard it.</b> The plain meaning of the verse appears to be that the garden was in need of someone to work it and to guard it, whereas the truth is that this was not the case. Why would it need a guard? Who was there to steal from it? Also, if the garden needed someone to work it, who has done this chore during the almost 6000 years that the garden has been unattended? What exactly was the nature of the work which had to be performed?",
                    "Know therefore that the entire description of the <span class=\"font1\">גן עדן</span> is to serve as an example of a spiritual environment. The Torah wanted to illustrate that just as a physical environment such as earth requires a) toil, planting, irrigation, etc. in order to produce man's food supply, and b) protection against harmful substances that damage the plants, the same applies to an environment described as <span class=\"font1\">גן עדן</span>. Nowadays <span class=\"font1\">גן עדן</span> is the \"soil,\" i.e. the environment for disembodied souls, seeing the bodies have been expelled. Even as such it requires both work and protection against negative influences. The specific work required in <span class=\"font1\">גן עדן</span> consists of Torah study. The Torah demonstrates the validity of such illustrative figures of speech when Moses described his speech in Deut. 32,2 in these words: \"May my discourse come down as the rain, my speech distil as the dew, like showers on young growth and like droplets on the grass.\" The \"young growth\" is a simile for the positive commandments. The author cites a number of examples where G'd is described as \"planting\" man's good deeds. The protective activity the Torah describes as <span class=\"font1\">לשמרה</span>, refers to the observance of the negative commandments. Non-observance of the negative commandments of the Torah is apt to destroy the fabric of the spiritual environment represented by <span class=\"font1\">גן עדן</span>. Our sages in <i>Sotah</i> 2 already tell us that sin, i.e. transgression of a negative commandment, extinguishes <span class=\"font1\">מצות</span> though it does not extinguish the Torah. This latter statement does not mean that it is not within the power of such a sin to harm Torah at all, it only means that a single <span class=\"font1\">עבירה</span> cannot accomplish that. Sustained sinful activity could certainly undermine the Torah absolutely.",
                    "At any rate the use of such terms as \"to work it and to protect it\" in connection with <span class=\"font1\">גן עדן</span> is perfectly justified. At the time when G'd placed Adam in <span class=\"font1\">גן עדן</span>, Adam was able to see how his positive actions contributed to the well-being of the garden. Once he had been expelled he was denied the ability to see the results of his activities. His spiritual part, however, was not denied the chance to accumulate good deeds and to eventually \"see\" the results in the Hereafter."

The Torah also repeated that violating the command would result in death by saying: i.e. <span class=\"font1\">מות תמות</span>, instead of merely <span class=\"font1\">תמות</span>. The reason is 1) that Adam should command Eve not to eat from the tree of knowledge either; b) that the penalty would apply to her just as much as to Adam himself (who had heard the commandment from G'd directly). The repetition of these words also constitutes both a warning and a spelling out of the penalty, something that halachah demands when capital punishment is involved.",

The Lord G'd said: \"It is not good for man to be alone, etc.\"</b> This is difficult since G'd had mentioned already on the day He created man that the species had been created male and female (1,27). Another problem in the text is the expression <span class=\"font1\">אעשה</span>, \"I shall make for him a helpmate.\" The Torah then immediately proceeds to describe that the mammals and the birds were formed, i.e. <span class=\"font1\">ויצר השם אלוקים</span> (2,19). This gives the impression that G'd intended one of these animals to be man's helpmate. Such a thought is not only extremely strange, but if true it would also result in one of those animals being deprived of its own mate! Besides, why did G'd have to put Adam to sleep and to remove part of his body? Could He not have formed woman as dust from the earth as He had formed man himself, especially since He formed Eve on the very same day He formed Adam (5,2) <span class=\"font1\">זכר ונקבה בראם</span>? Our sages have given many homiletical explanations in answer to these questions, but they have not provided us with <span class=\"font1\">פשט</span>, straightforward answers that justify the text as it stands. ",
                    "We may have to fall back on the opinions expressed in <i>Berachot</i> 61 that originally man was created with two faces in one body. The Talmud there offers two opinions as to what was removed from Adam, a tail or a face, respectively. This is a reasonable explanation because it justifies G'd's blessing or command to Adam to be fruitful and to multiply (1,28) at a time when woman had not yet been reported as a separate entity. ",
                    "It is in keeping with G'd's propensity for preparing everything good ahead of time, and providing many more opportunities for man to do good than evil. However, we must ask why He separated the two bodies enabling Eve to fall victim to the temptation by the serpent? This leads us to examine the cause of Adam's (Eve) sin, what happened to him and all of mankind as a result. We have found that woman became the cause of all that the world lost because the serpent prevailed over her in a match of wits. This occurred because Adam was not at her side at the time of Eve's encounter with the serpent. He was asleep as a result of having had marital relations with his wife (<i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 19,3). Another version in the <i>Midrash</i> there suggests that G'd had taken him on a tour of the earth. As a result the serpent encountered Eve on her own and succeeded in seducing her. If the Torah had reported man's creation and the subsequent separation of Eve's body sequentially, without interposing Adam's experiences on earth in the interval, many people would have argued that what happened was all G'd's fault. They would have said that if G'd had not separated her body from that of her husband, thereby making a drastic change in what He had created originally, the serpent would never have had a chance to seduce Eve. In order to forestall such an argument the Torah tells us first the reason that G'd separated Eve's body from Adam's, i.e. in answer to Adam's own request. His observations of how the animals lived, male and female as separate bodies, had made him desirous of a similar arrangement. G'd had only the best of intentions, as usual. This is also the reason the Torah told us already at the outset that man was equipped to procreate from the moment he was created. Being one and the same body obviously had some of the same disadvantages as being a Siamese twin. G'd therefore decided it would be better for man's helpmate to be <span class=\"font1\">כנגדו</span>, an appropriate complement, rather than the other half of his body. In this way she could be a help to him at all times instead of being a hindrance on occasion. Eve's being a <b>separate</b> body was not dictated by Adam's need to procreate. Seeing that the separation of her body served only to please Adam we must ask why none of the other creatures could have been trained to perform that task for Adam while leaving Eve in the state she had been created. The Torah therefore describes in verses 19 and 20 that Adam did indeed search for a suitable helpmate amongst all the other creatures but did not find one that was acceptable to him. Naming the animals, i.e. identifying their essence, was part of that search for a suitable helpmate. Eve's existence as a separate body from Adam had therefore become mandatory from Adam's point of view. It is totally incorrect to blame G'd for subsequent developments, such as Eve finding herself temporarily alone, facing an evil influence whose existence she had been quite unaware of. The Torah's report about both Adam's and Eve's innocence, i.e. their lack of shame at being nude, are all facts the Torah supplies to enable us to better understand the causes that led to the sin. Human relationships are based on people facing each other, i.e. <span class=\"font1\">כנגדו</span>. The Torah describes Adam's profound joy when he finally beheld the partner who up until then had been hidden from him, i.e. had faced backwards. From G'd's point of view the original arrangement was perfectly acceptable, He had not created an imperfect human species. Any change was entirely in response to Adam's frame of mind, to accomodate him. Our sages have supplied us with numerous reasons why G'd did not <b>create</b> an entirely new human being to serve as Adam's helpmate. When Solomon told us in Kohelet (4,9) <span class=\"font1\">טובים השנים מן האחד</span>, that two are better than one, that they can help each other, this has nothing to do with G'd having created man's form in such a way that he could have impregnated the wife which was part of him but facing backwards.",
                    "Perhaps the objective reason G'd had created the human species as a pair in a single body was to distinguish between the functions of the bodies of the animals and the functions of the human body. Animals mate indiscriminately, i.e. a male will mate with any female available to him, the act of mating being merely a response to biological urges. The fact that the Torah on occasion stresses the <span class=\"font1\">זכר ונקבה</span> element when mentioning animals as pairs such as when they entered Noach's ark, does not mean that they have exclusive partners. The average animal does not recognise a female of its species as specifically \"his\" female. This is not the way G'd wanted man to relate to the subject of mating. It would have been impossible for Adam to describe his wife as <span class=\"font1\">בשר מבשרי</span>, flesh of my own, were it not for the fact that Eve had been part of his own body previously. The whole idea that man's <span class=\"font1\">זווג</span> is arranged in heaven would have been impossible to understand but for the fact that the female of the species is considered man's \"other half.\" This consideration may also be the reason that when the Torah legislated forbidden sexual relations (Leviticus 18) the subject is always the male. It is forbidden to engage in sexual intercourse with certain women as they could not possibly be your missing \"half.\""

Man and his wife were both nude and did not experience a feeling of shame.</b> Before the sin the upper \"face\" and the lower \"face\" were equally holy. The element of evil which attached itself to man after the sin concentrates on the lower part of his body. This is the reason that the holy covenant between man and G'd, i.e. circumcision, has to be performed on his sexual organ. The foreskin, <span class=\"font1\">ערלה</span>, is the symbol of what kabbalists call the <span class=\"font1\">קליפה</span>, the shell or peel which makes penetration to the holy essence difficult. This is why G'd commanded its removal. Inasmuch as all adulterers are victims of the sexual urges burning within them, G'd ordered that this part of man, the source of these abominations, be hidden from view, be covered. Our sages have added the prohibition not to touch that part of one's body (unnecessarily). <span class=\"font1\">אורח חיים ,ב,א</span> even tells us to avoid having to look at these parts of our body when we get up and get dressed. The Talmud <i>Shabbat</i> 108 coined the phrase <span class=\"font1\">יד לאמה תיקצץ</span>, that the hand which touches the male organ deserves to be cut off. This is because the touch of the hand on the male organ causes sexual arousal, or <span class=\"font1\">אש זרה</span> in the language of our sages, something that was not the case before the sin. Henceforth man would expose himself to the danger of that alien fire consuming him if he touched those parts. Let us look for a moment at what Abraham commanded Eliezer before he sent him on the mission to find a wife for Isaac (Genesis 24,2). He instructed his servant: <span class=\"font1\">שים נא ידך תחת ירכי</span>, \"place your hand under my thigh.\" At first glance the instruction for Eliezer to place his hand on Abraham's male organ seems incompatible with what we have just explained. Our sages explain that Abraham was not comparable to his peers in this respect. The touch of a hand on this part of his body did not cause arousal. The act of circumcision he had performed on himself on that organ at an advanced age had made him far more resistant to the evil urge than others. His whole body could be considered as almost pure. The same applies to our verse, that prior to the sin the body was not subject to this <span class=\"font1\">אש זרה</span>, the burning passion of sexual arousal. Another meaning is based on the use of the future tense by the Torah. We would have expected <span class=\"font1\">ולא נתביישו</span>, \"they were not ashamed,\" instead of \"they will not be ashamed.\" The Torah teaches us then that notwithstanding the fact that Adam and Eve were both nude they had no reason to become ashamed as a result. The Torah mentioned this so that we would know who caused the subsequent division between man's upper and lower body respectively."

The Torah therefore has to preface the account by pointing out that these words were carefully calculated, that the serpent was exceedingly sly. Any creature which is not exceedingly sly would most certainly not have succeeded in seducing a G'd-fearing woman such as Eve.",

                    "1) The serpent told Eve that by not eating from the tree of knowledge she would remain for all intents and purposes as if she had not eaten either from any of the other trees. The serpent indicated that the fruits of the other trees were totally inferior when compared to the fruit of the tree of knowledge. The word <span class=\"font1\">אף</span> was to indicate that Eve was to view the situation as if G'd had also forbidden all the other trees. The serpent's intent was to heighten Eve's desire to taste the fruit of the tree of knowledge. The more its virtues were extolled, the more intense the curiosity to test that statement. At the same time the serpent hoped to diminish Eve's interest in the other trees. It is characteristic of the workings of the evil urge to exaggerate one's expectations of the forbidden and to denigrate the value of that which is permitted.",
                    "2) The serpent pretended to teach Eve a halachah, thus creating the impression that it was very knowledgeable and on G'd's wavelength. It told Eve that G'd had first planted the tree of knowledge and had then used its shoots to plant all the other trees in the garden. This was part of the seduction. Once the original tree is out of bounds the other trees are automatically forbidden inasmuch as they are \"earthed\" branches of the original tree (compare <i>Orlah</i> chapter 1,5 where it is taught that such a branch is considered as a new plant for the purpose of calculating the three years of the <span class=\"font1\">ערלה</span> prohibition). The serpent's argument therefore was that though G'd had <b>specifically</b> prohibited only the fruit of the tree of knowledge, the fruit of the other trees were out of bounds by reason of the laws governing \"earthed\" branches. [The author supplies additional halachic sources, which I do not feel are relevant. Ed.] At any rate the meaning of <span class=\"font1\">אף כי אמר אלוקים</span> would have to be translated as though G'd said: \"if you accept that commandment\" you must automatically also accept its extension as far as the other trees are concerned because the three years required until the new trees are considered as no longer drawing on the original tree have not yet expired.",
                    "3) The word <span class=\"font1\">אף</span> referred to the fact that G'd had not commanded Eve anything directly, He had only commanded her husband. The serpent said that it was a witness to the fact that G'd had indeed forbidden the eating of the fruit of any of the trees. The serpent had two things in mind by making that statement. A) If Eve were to believe it, the serpent could then point to the illogical nature of such a prohibition which would deny man everything to be found in the garden. The way for rebellion against G'd would then have been paved. B) To provoke a confrontation with Adam who had told Eve that G'd had only forbidden the fruit of the tree of knowledge. The serpent wanted that Adam's testimony be considered as having been refuted. We find an interesting statement by the school of Shammai in <i>Ediyot</i> 4,11. When two pairs of witnesses testify against an individual, the first pair claiming he had made a vow comprising two periods of abstention from wine, etc, whereas the other pair testfied that the vow involved five such periods, the school of Shammai considers this as an example of conflicting testimony. As a result the individual would not be held liable for anything on the basis of this testimony. The school of Hillel holds that inasmuch as both pairs of witnesses are agreed concerning at least two periods of <span class=\"font1\">נזירות</span>, abstention from wine, etc., the person testified against is guilty if he failed to honour that part of his vow. A similar disagreement is discussed in the Talmud <i>Sanhedrin</i> except that there only one pair of witnesses testified, one of them testifying to a vow concerning two periods, the other claiming that the vow comprised five periods. The serpent reasoned that since there were only two witnesses, i.e. Adam and the serpent, Adam having testified to a single tree being forbidden whereas the serpent testified that all trees were forbidden the halachah should be based on the school of Shammai, i.e. the testimony was void, and as a result Eve could not be held culpable for eating from the tree of knowledge. After having written this down, I found that the author of <i>Tikkuney HaZohar</i> section 59 agrees with me. The author states that the serpent violated the commandment not to testify falsely by saying that G'd had forbidden all the fruit of all the trees in the garden. It is characteristic of Satan to plant lies in the minds of people, thus creating false images and beliefs in their hearts. Sometimes Satan convinces man that the sin he is planning is inevitable so that he might as well not feel badly about committing it. This is the slyest way of all to seduce people into committing a sin.",
                    "The reason that G'd created such a seducer in this world seeing He has our best interests at heart is to increase the reward we will qualify for if we made a successful effort to resist all forms of temptation.",
                    "<b><span class=\"font1\">ויאמר אל האשה</span>, he said to Eve, etc.</b> The serpent spoke in the kind of hissing that is characteristic of its species. The Torah does not mean to give the impression that the serpent was able to speak like humans do. Prior to the sin, man was able to comprehend the language of the animals, even the conversation carried on by the inert parts of nature. Every creature G'd created was equipped with a means of expressing itself to enable it to praise its Creator. Our sages base this on Proverbs 16,6: <span class=\"font1\">כל פעל השם למענהו</span>, \"G'd has made everything for His sake.\" Some of our sages have composed books in which they translate the songs of the animals and birds. Some of our greatest scholars were able to to understand the various sounds made by the animals, especially a man such as Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai. If the latter was able to understand the parables of the foxes (compare <i>Sukkah</i> 25), Adam, who was a direct creation of G'd, was certainly able to."

Concerning the first argument that all the trees were forbidden, Eve said that this was not so, that only the tree in the centre of the garden was prohibited. Concerning the argument that all the other trees were really earthed branches of the tree of knowledge she argued that this was quite irrelevant. It might have been relevant if G'd had not specifically permitted the fruit of all the other trees. There was therefore absolutely no sense in denying oneself something G'd had specifically permitted. She refused to accept the testimony of the serpent because it contradicted the testimony of her own husband. She argued along the lines of the school of Hillel, i.e. the common denominator between what the serpent had declared as out of bounds and what her husband had declared as out of bounds was only the tree of knowledge. Therefore, that tree and its fruit was forbidden; the other trees were permitted since no valid testimony existed that would deny them to her.",
                    "As to the argument that the tree was so far superior to all the other trees etc., Eve said she thought differently. The tree was inferior; G'd had forbidden it because eating from it would bring on death, the clearest proof that it was inferior to the other trees. Eve told the serpent that all of G'd's commandments were intended for man's benefit, not in order to cause him harm or damage. All the many fruit trees in the garden were proof that G'd had laboured to present man with a beautiful and enjoyable universe. As far as the forbidden tree of knowledge was concerned, G'd had <b>only</b> forbidden its harmful part, i.e. its fruit. Eve argued correctly. This is the meaning of her words: \"from the trees of the garden we may eat. She claimed that this was proof that G'd has our best interests at heart. She reasoned that this in turn proved that G'd was concerned to protect man against harmful influences. Eve added that G'd said: \"do not touch it,\" although G'd is not on record as having said this. She considered the prohibition to touch the tree a logical extension of G'd's concern that His creatures should not come to any harm. It is also possible that at the time Adam had told her not to eat from that tree he had added the warning not to touch it as an additional safeguard because he realised that its fruit contained a deadly poison.",
                    "She told the serpent further that even if it were true that the tree of knowledge was the most superior of all the trees, the fact remained that G'd had said not to eat from it on pain of death. How could one ignore such a warning?! Perhaps she added that the tree was not to be touched for fear that some oil on the outside of the fruit would serve as nutrient for her skin if it came into contact with it. Such bodily contact might be just as forbidden as oiling one's skin is prohibited on the Day of Atonement as part of denying oneself food and drink (based on <i>Pessachim</i> 21). Eve tried to point out that the advantages the tree seemed to offer were outweighed by its disadvantages. As a result the tree was actually the most inferior of all the trees in the garden. ",
                    "At this point Eve completely rejected the serpent's attempt to convince her to eat from the fruit of that tree. She decided that it was her and her husband's duty to keep their distance from that tree."

The serpent said: \"You will most certainly not die.\"</b> The reason the serpent repeated the reference to death was to counter Eve's fears that the tree itself was lethal, or that even if it were not harmful at all, G'd would punish them with death for disobeyimg Him. The serpent claimed that neither natural nor judicial death would result from contact with the tree or its fruit. Assuming that the serpent was right, this in turn raises the question of <b>why</b> G'd had forbidden the fruit of that tree? The serpent had to make such a prohibition sound plausible. This is why it continued that G'd was aware that as soon as man ate from that tree he would become a real competitor to G'd, i.e. knowing what is good and what is harmful. This argument was pure blasphemy. The only reason that the wicked serpent was able to employ such an argument was that its creation had preceded that of man. The serpent was able to use its senior status in the history of creation to claim that it was privy to matters that Adam and Eve could not have been privy to. He also argued that the reason he (the serpent) had been denied entry to <span class=\"font1\">גן עדן</span> was that entry had been permitted only to those who were not privy to the secret of the tree of knowledge and what it represented. It claimed that by preventing the serpent from entering the garden G'd had wanted to preserve the secret of the power that tree would impart to those who ate from it. According to the serpent, once Eve would eat from that tree she would no longer be afraid of G'd, and G'd would no longer exercise any control over her. The use of such an argument was idolatrous. According to our halachah idolatry is punishable even when it is merely an intellectual conviction (<i>Berachot</i> 12).",
                    "According to <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 19,3 there is another reason that the serpent used the expression <span class=\"font1\">מות תמות</span>. The serpent pushed Eve against the tree and \"proved\" that touching the tree was not lethal- as Eve had claimed. It argued that just as touching the tree had not resulted in death, neither would eating from its fruit. We must examine this so-called \"proof.\" If we accept that Eve had convinced herself that contact with the tree would have fatal consequences because of its very nature, the fact that her contact with the tree had proved harmless should have convinced her of the tree's harmlessness. There was therefore no reason to be afraid to eat from it. Alternatively, if Eve's fear of touching the tree were based on her belief that G'd had outlawed both eating from the tree and touching it, she now had \"proof\" that this was not so because nothing had happened to her after she had touched the tree. We do not consider this in the nature of any \"proof,\" seeing that G'd's punishment did not have to be meted out immediately. We therefore prefer the explanation we offered previously that the serpent wanted to \"prove\" to Eve that the tree itself was quite harmless.",
                    "If you were to ask why G'd would have created a tree that was poisonous at all, the answer is -as in many such instances- that the greater the physical and spiritual effort to overcome such potential impediments to our faith, the greater the reward which is stored up in heaven for such acts of faith, a reward to be consumed by us in the Hereafter. This concept is phrased in <i>Avot</i> 5,26: <span class=\"font1\">לפום צערא אגרא</span>, as \"the reward is commensurate with the effort expended.\" Had G'd imposed strict limits on the power of the seducer to entice us, overcoming him would not have amounted to much. The <i>Zohar</i> illustrates this principle by the example of a father who wanted to test his son's moral fibre and who instructed a beautiful harlot to use all her wiles to seduce him. At the same time he had instructed the son to keep his distance from the harlot in question."

                    "<b> <span class=\"font1\">ותרא האשה כי טוב העץ</span>. Eve saw that the tree was good.</b> The first problem is how could one judge what is good to eat by merely looking at it? Another question is why the Torah describes a feeling of the mouth before describing the effect on the eye? The verse should have read: \"she saw that the tree was a beautiful sight and that it was good as food,\" in that order. Furthermore, whence did Eve know that the tree was apt to add to her perceptive powers, i.e. <span class=\"font1\">להשכיל</span>? If the Torah merely intended to tell us that the serpents's description of the tree had been accurate, why describe the woman as seeing something that she did not see? Also why did the Torah add two superfluous words <span class=\"font1\">הוא</span>, and <span class=\"font1\">העץ</span> a second time? If the repetition of the word is justified, why did the Torah not also write the word <span class=\"font1\">העץ</span> after the word <span class=\"font1\">תאוה</span>?",
                    "The verse describes the way in which Eve was snared, and how she eventually became willing to listen to her seducer. When you examine Eve's earlier words, you will find that she said: \"and from the <b>fruit</b> of the tree in the center of the garden, G'd' said \"do not eat.\" She had expressed her conviction that only the fruit of the tree was forbidden, that the trunk, the branches, etc., were permitted. She may have arrived at that conviction for one of two reasons. 1) Adam had commanded her in those very words. 2) Though Adam had mentioned only the tree without specifying its fruit, etc., she reasoned that there would have been no point in forbidding something that anyways was not food, such as the trunk, the branches, and the leaves. We have pointed out earlier that whereas the other trees did not taste similar to their fruit, the tree of knowledge was the exception, its trunk, etc. being just as edible as its fruit. We must therefore assume that Eve had already tasted the tree itself, not having considered it as forbidden. She also applied the prohibition to touch it as applicable only to its fruit, not to the trunk, etc. At any rate, Eve had already experienced the taste of the tree's trunk and nothing had happened. Alternatively, she may have discounted the prohibition to touch the tree knowing that this was not a direct command from G'd Himself and would not lead to death. ",
                    "Having tasted from the tree itself, and having experienced that its nature was different from all the other trees, she decided to take a closer look at the fruit of that tree. It was then that she discovered that the fruit exerted a powerful visual attraction; the word <span class=\"font1\">הוא</span> refers back to the word <span class=\"font1\">פרי</span>, fruit. It could not refer to the word <span class=\"font1\">העץ</span>, the tree, as this would be unnecessary. It would have sufficed to say <span class=\"font1\">וכי תאוה לעינים</span>, if it were merely a reference to the tree. The word <b><span class=\"font1\">העץ</span></b> is needed in the sequence <span class=\"font1\">ונחמד <b>העץ</b> לעינים</span> because the subject matter had changed from the fruit to the tree. The knowledge of the nature of the tree had been based on her sense of taste, whereas her perception of the nature of the fruit was based only on her sense of sight. The Torah explains that Eve's purpose in eating of the fruit was to broaden her powers of perception. At this point Eve believed that the serpent had spoken truthfully when it claimed that as a result of eating from the fruit of that tree she would gain greater insights, and that G'd had forbidden the fruit only in order to prevent her from gaining the insight which would make her equal to G'd. The Torah emphasises that \"she took from its fruit,\" as she had already tasted the trunk. We have now completed answering the various questions we raised about this verse. Eve gave to her husband from this fruit out of her love for him; she wanted him to share her new insights so that he too would become G'd-like.",
                    "I have seen it said in defence of Eve that her sin was not so serious as she could not imagine that G'd had created a being whose sole purpose it was to test man's love for G'd by having Satan masquerade within it to try and mislead man. If such a thought had even occurred to Eve she would never have engaged in a dialogue with the serpent. She would have acted just like the righteous nowadays who do not listen to or engage in disputes with tempters however slick-tongued they may be in making something sinful look desirable. The righteous of our time are not so naive; this is why they can withstand the wiles of Satan. Poor innocent Eve did not have their advantage and that is why she fell victim to the seductive tactics of the serpent (Satan). She had furthermore been mislead by the taste of the tree itself, something she thought of as permitted. She also did not possess as analytical a mind as that of a man, else she would have been able to resist the lure to eat from the fruit of that tree. Had she not first erred in believing that the tree itself was pemitted to eat from, she never would have considered eating from the fruit as well.",
                    "Another reason that may have accounted for Eve falling an easy victim to Satan's lure was that she considered it to have been a mistake to accept the prohibition not to eat from the tree. When she accepted the commandment she had not thought that it would be so difficult to observe. Originally the tree had not appeared to her as sufficiently desirable to pose a threat to her obedience to G'd's command. We find a parallel to such considerations when we consider how many covenants G'd concluded with the Jewish people to ensure that they would not go back on their commitment to observe the Torah. G'd did not consider it sufficient to just give the commandments to the Jewish people without creating a legal device to make the commitment irrevocable. Our sages (<i>Shabbat</i> 85 based on Exodus 19,17) tell us that at Mount Sinai G'd had threatened to kill the Jewish people unless they embraced the Torah. He subsequently reinforced the validity of their acceptance by making them swear an oath. Our rabbis go so far as to describe the renewed acceptance by the Jewish people of the Torah at the time of Mordechai as the <b>only</b> free acceptance of G'd's laws, describing the original acceptance as having occcurred under conditions of duress and therefore legally not valid (<i>Shabbat</i> 88). Inasmuch as Eve had not been sworn to observe the commandment not to eat from the tree she was not really obligated to do so. Even though she had orally accepted the commandment and such acceptance is comparable to the uttering of a vow, it is in the category of a vow erroneously entered into, something that can be annulled retroactively (compare <i>Nedarim</i> 66). The exact text in the Talmud is as follows: If someone undertakes not to drink wine because the wine is bad for his digestion, and he is informed that aged wine is good for his digestion, his vow is annulled and he may drink any kind of wine. We face a similar situation here. When Eve had accepted G'd's commandment prior to having become conscious of the powerful attraction exerted on her by this tree she had been quite sincere. However, once she noticed the powerful pull which the fruit of that tree exerted on her she regretted having undertaken to honour the commandment not to eat from it.",
                    "We therefore have two causes that helped to mislead Eve. The reason she may have thought that only the fruit of the tree was forbidden was because her husband had not given her precise instructions. Had her husband told her that G'd had said: \"You may eat from all <b>the trees</b> of the garden, but from <b>the tree of knowledge</b> in the centre of the garden you must not eat,\" she would never have considered the trunk as permissible, and the fact that neither eating from it nor touching it had resulted in any harm to her would not have served as a verification of the serpent's argument. Eve's not having been aware of the attractive nature of the tree was also Adam's fault. He had not told her that G'd had described the tree as the tree <b>of knowledge of good and evil.</b> He had only told her not to eat from the tree <b>in the middle of the garden</b>, without a reference to its special nature. Had Eve been aware that the tree was of such special significance the serpent could not have tricked her, and she herself would have been unable to invoke her lack of knowledge as a reason to revoke her acceptance of G'd's command not to eat from it. ",
                    "None of the causes of the sin can be attributed to G'd, all were due to man's inadequacy, i.e. both Adam's and Eve's.",
                    "For all we know, Adam may not have been aware that the trunk of the tree of knowledge was edible. He had only tasted the other trees and found invariably that their trunks were not edible. He did not realise that the earth had conformed with G'd's instructions to the letter when it produced the tree of knowledge. The manner in which the Torah describes Eve's realisation of the tree's properties suggests that she did not have an inkling previously that this tree had such special features."

This is what this verse is all about. Each of them was ashamed, one of the other. The use of the words <span class=\"font1\">ותפקחנה עיני</span>…reflects the teaching of our sages that \"one does not commit a sin unless one's mental eyes had first been blinded.\" Isaiah 42, 18 speaks about <span class=\"font1\">והעורים הביטו לראות</span>, \"blind ones, look up and see!\" Surely the prophet must have referred to the wicked whose mental eyes had been blinded. Once the temporary mental blindness caused by the decision to sin had passed and the seducer had departed, they became aware of their nudity. Satan is also referred to as personifying darkness, someone who blinds people's eyes. The nudity referred to here is not merely lack of ordinary clothing, but the removal of an aura of holiness which had served them thus far in lieu of clothing in the accepted sense of the word. It is characteristic of a wicked person that after he has committed an abominable act he becomes aware that what he did was an abomination."

He added \"which You put with me\" in justification for not having enquired where the fruit had come from.

It was only <b>after</b> he had tasted the fruit that he became aware that this fruit must have been from the tree of knowledge.

                    "Another peculiarity in our verse is the word <span class=\"font1\">היה</span>. G'd was afraid that Adam might live forever, not that he had <b>already</b> achieved that status. The word therefore should have been <span class=\"font1\">עוד לא היה</span>, or something to that effect. Furthermore, why would the ability to distinguish between good and evil elevate man to the status of G'd? How can we justify the expression <span class=\"font1\">ממנו</span>, \"like one of Us?\" This would give the impression that there are physical beings in the heavens!",
                    "In view of the fact that G'd had warned man not to eat from the tree of knowledge He was not worried about his eating from the tree of life. He did not think man would be motivated to do so either of his own volition or as a result of seduction by the serpent. The seducer only urges man to taste what is forbidden; Satan never urges you to do what is perfectly permissible. Man on his own had no desire to eat from that tree in order to secure permanent life, something that was his birthright anyways. It was only after he had forfeited his birthright that he would seek to find an alternative for what he had lost. If G'd had forbidden the tree of life immediately, the serpent might have succeeded to entice even Adam himself into eating from it. Therefore G'd was wise in not including the tree of life in the prohibition immediately. After having eaten from the tree of knowledge with its fateful consequences, Adam's priorities had changed, and G'd now had to be concerned lest man eat from that tree in order to neutralize the mortality that had been decreed on him. ",
                    "The meaning of the word <b><span class=\"font1\">היה</span></b> then is: \"up until now man <b>was</b> alone unto himself,\" i.e. he was immortal,\" however, now that he has lost his immortality, he might want to eat from the tree of life. The word <span class=\"font1\">אחד ממנו</span>, would refer to the uniqueness of man on earth. He alone of all the creatures <b>on earth</b> was immortal. The knowledge man acquired due to having eaten from the tree of knowledge might prompt him to want to eat from the tree of life to recapture the uniqueness of his former stature of ruling over the creatures of earth. I have found a proof for my interpretation of the word <span class=\"font1\">ממנו</span> in Onkelos. Onkelos translates the word as <span class=\"font1\">מניה</span>, \"from him,\" i.e. <span class=\"font1\">כאחד ממנו</span>, \"like the only one of its kind\"",
                    "There is another way to solve the problems we have raised. On the day G'd commanded Adam not to eat from the tree of knowledge He gave two commandments. G'd actually allowed for the possibility that Adam would violate His command by saying: \"should you eat from it, your only way to rehabilitate yourself will be through death, through mortality of the body.\" In halachah we would consider the second commandment, i.e. the need to die as a <span class=\"font1\">לאו הניתק לעשה</span>, a negative commandment tied to a positive commandment. The positive commandment is viewed as the <span class=\"font1\">תיקון</span>, reparation of the negative commandment that has been violated. We have mentioned earlier that had it not been for the sin, Adam would have become so refined that he would have been considered as at home in the world of the permanent beings, just as the prophet Elijah who departed this world, body intact. It was only due to the sin that Adam's body forfeited the chance to rise with him to such lofty heights. Once deprived of the opportunity to refine his body in the manner described, the very act of separation of the soul from the body becomes the symbol of the inability to achieve the elevation of the body to eternal life. Under such circumstances man would not eat from the tree of life of his own accord. He would be afraid that as a result of eating from it he would forever forfeit potential rehabilitation should he violate the command not to eat from the tree of knowledge. Only death could afford him that chance, and once he had eaten from the tree of life he would not die. The matter was different, however, once he had eaten from the tree of knowledge without having eaten as yet from the tree of life. If he had eaten deliberately from the tree of knowledge, man would certainly be careful not to eat from the tree of life as that would condemn him eternally to a physical existence only. However, as we explained, man's sin had been inadvertent, meaning that he thought he was not bound to die in order to rehabilitate himself. If so, there was no powerful incentive for him to stay clear of the tree of life. Actually, Adam erred; even though his sin was inadvertent it could only be completely atoned for through death of his body at some stage. The principal reason that G'd had commanded man not to eat from the tree of knowledge was to prevent knowledge of evil becoming an integral part of his perceptions. His perceptions were meant to concentrate only on what is good. This is what Solomon meant (Kohelet 7,29) when he said that <span class=\"font1\">ישר עשה האלוקים את האדם</span>, that \"G'd made man perfectly upright.\" Evil did not figure as part of man's imagination and fantasies. All of this changed after he ate from the tree of knowledge. The fact that man felt naked and ashamed is proof that his fantasies now included things that were evil. Once man had undergone such a drastic change and the purpose of the prohibition to eat from the tree of knowledge had been irreversibly thwarted, he would no longer consider not eating from the tree of life as his insurance should he need to recapture his original status. He had already lost that status irretrievably. With the incentive not to eat from the tree of life gone, G'd had to forbid man to eat from that tree. In view of the fact that man had ignored a previous command, G'd deemed it safer to place the tree of life out of Adam's reach by expelling him from the garden.",
                    "Having said all this we can now understand a difficult passage in <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 21,6. Commenting on the words: \"<b>and now</b>, lest he reach out and take also from the tree of life and eat thereof and live forever,\" Rabbi Aba bar Kahane says that the word <span class=\"font1\">ועתה</span>, \"<b>and now</b>\" in this verse teaches that G'd encouraged Adam to repent. This word is used by the Torah to introduce the process of repentance. For instance, we have Deut. 10 where Moses described the sin of the golden calf and his endeavours to obtain forgiveness for the Jewish people. Verse 12 there commences with the words: <span class=\"font1\">ועתה ישראל</span>, and goes on to describe what it is that G'd asks of the Jewish people so that they can rehabilitate themselves. The expression <b><span class=\"font1\">פן</span></b>, always means \"not or no.\" G'd said: \"lest he stretch out his hand and take also from the tree of life and and eat of it and live forever.\" Thus far Rabbi Aba bar Kahane. This <i>Midrash</i> is extremely puzzling. How could G'd justify encouraging man to do repentance by saying to him \"NO!?\" Why did G'd only start to worry that Adam would eat from the tree of life after He had said to him \"No?\" It appears as if G'd would not have been concerned about Adam living forever if he had done <span class=\"font1\">תשובה</span>! This cannot be since man had already become mortal on the day he ate from the tree of knowledge!",
                    "Actually, keeping in mind our exegesis, the words of Rabbi Ada bar Kahane make sense. G'd wanted Adam to realise that he had sinned by eating from the tree of knowledge. He did this by telling him to repent. Adam answered this invitation to do <span class=\"font1\">תשובה</span> by saying that he had not sinned in a manner that required him to repent. He argued that he had been unaware of committing a sin when he ate from the tree. When G'd heard that Adam thought that an inadvertently committed sin does not require repentance, He began to worry that now there was no impediment to Adam eating from the tree of life. This is why G'd had to expel him from the garden to prevent this from happening. Later on Adam did repent and spent 130 years immersing himself in the waters of the river <span class=\"font1\">גיחון</span> to atone for his sin [compare <i>Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer</i> 20. Ed.].",
                    "Although G'd had said that Adam would die \"on the day\" he would eat from the tree of knowledge, the word \"day\" could have one of two connotations. It could mean a period of 24 hours, i.e. a day in human terms, or it could refer to a day in G'd's terms, i.e. 1000 years. If it is the latter, the meaning of the warning was that Adam would die before he reached the age of 1000 years. The respective connotation of the word depends on the severity of the sin and the feeling the sinner had at the time he committed the sin. If the sinner intended to anger G'd at the time he sinned, the meaning of the word \"day\" would be the minimum. The sinner would have to die before that period of 24 hours expired. If, however, the sin was not committed intentionally and the sinner had made it plain that he had not intended to sin, he would be given the maximum period possible, i.e. he would live up to but not including 1000 years."

Abel's soul is supposed to have been reincarnated in the body of Moses (compare <i>Zohar</i> 1,54 on this passage). Abel suffered multiple injuries at the hands of Cain because Cain did not know where to inflict a lethal injury. The pains suffered by Abel in the process removed any vestige of evil that may have been in him so that when Moses was born he was totally good.

Cain exploited this pity of his brother Abel to attack him and kill him (<i>Tanchuma Bereshit</i> 9).

By placing the word <span class=\"font1\">את</span> in front of the word <span class=\"font1\">הבל</span>, the Torah alluded to the lack of brotherliness with which Cain related to Abel. Another reason for the word <span class=\"font1\">את</span> both times before the name Cain and the name Abel is to indicate that twin sisters were born together with these brothers (<i>Yevamot</i> 62)."

Why was Cain foolish enough to tell the One who knows everything that he did not know where his brother was? After all, who would be aware of G'd's supervising everything that occurs on earth if not the people with whom G'd had communicated directly such as Adam, Eve, Cain, etc.? Why did Cain add the gratuitous and provocative remark: \"Am I my brother's keeper?\" Why did G'd have to mention (verse 10) that Abel's blood cried out to Him \"from the earth?\" Besides, what was the nature of that outcry? Why did G'd curse the earth in addition to the murderer? What harm did it do for the earth to have swallowed Abel's blood? The alternative would have been for the dogs to lick it up.

                    "Cain was jealous of Abel because he thought that Abel's existence was the cause that he himself had been degraded. He thought that his own shortcomings had come to light only by comparing him to his brother. Once his brother would be out of the way G'd would have to turn to him seeing there was no one else to turn to. This is why he planned to kill Abel. He realised that the stench of Abel's decaying body would rise heavenwards. Inasmuch as man had been forbidden to murder, Cain sought a way of killing Abel without laying a hand on him. We have heard that Cain was a man of the earth; he was familiar with how the earth functioned. Our sages (compare <i>Nedarim</i> 39) say that earth has limbs just like a human being, i.e. the equivalent of hands, feet, etc. Cain knew which part of the earth served as its mouth, its eyes, etc. As a result of this familiarity with the earth he found a way to kill Abel with guile without actually laying a hand on him. The Torah describes that while Cain and Abel walked in the field Cain found a suitable spot to carry out his evil plan. The word <span class=\"font1\">ויקם</span> is not part of the act of murder. It means he simply stood over him in a spot where the earth would swallow him. The earth actually did the killing. While the Torah does not spell out the exact nature of Abel's death in <b>our</b> verse, it does so in verse 11.",
                    "When G'd asked Cain where his brother was, He did so to find out if Cain was aware of his sin. When Cain answered that he did not know Abel's whereabouts, G'd told him that he should have made it his business to know. To this Cain replied: \"Have You made me his keeper?\" He did not confess his evil deed. He either thought that G'd would not punish him for an indirect act, a cause, or he thought that G'd did not exercise this kind of supervision over man. When G'd persisted by asking: \"What did you do?\" He informed Cain that his wicked deed was the cause that the earth had swallowed Abel. The words: \"the voice of your brother Abel's blood cries out to me <b>from the earth</b>,\" mean that Abel thought it was the earth that killed him, not Cain. This is why he complained to G'd. G'd cursed Cain even more severely than the earth because he was the cause of what the earth had done. Henceforth the earth was no longer permitted to open its mouth (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 37). Isaiah 24,16 describes the songs of the earth as originating in its \"wings,\" i.e. its periphery. Had the earth not been forbidden to open its mouth, no doubt its songs would have originated from its mouth. When the earth was to swallow all the Egyptians who had drowned, it was worried about opening its mouth until G'd gave it special permission as alluded to in Exodus 15,12: \"You inclined Your right hand and the earth swallowed them.\" Perhaps this is the problem the sages referred to when they claimed that Cain killed Abel with a stone. As a result Abel suffered many injuries which would account for the Torah writing <span class=\"font1\">דמי אחיך צועקים</span> instead of <span class=\"font1\">דם אחיך צועק</span>, i.e. the plural for the word blood. Death would not have been due to any single injury as in the case of someone who is slain by the sword.

When the Torah recorded some history for both obvious and hidden reasons, it became necessary to mention the death of Adam and his descendants. G'd began the report by stressing that as far as He was concerned none of this tragedy needed to have happened. People should not accuse G'd as having toyed with creating living beings only in order to destroy them whenever He felt like it. After all, why would G'd bother to create at all if not for the benefit of His creatures? This being the case, why would He destroy the very finest of His products? G'd therefore wanted to go on record that if the descendants of Adam were mostly doomed it was because of their <span class=\"font1\">תולדות</span> their own developments, i.e. their own inadequacies, not G'd's. The word <span class=\"font1\">תולדות</span> then predominantly refers to man's deeds. Rashi has already told us in connection with Genesis 6,9: <span class=\"font1\">אלה תולדות נח</span>, <span class=\"font1\">נח</span>, that the principal descendants of the righteous are their good deeds. In our verse the Torah stresses the reverse. When G'd created man He created him in G'd's likeness. His <span class=\"font1\">תולדות</span>, developments, however, all tended to run counter to G'd's will. Ever since the day he was created man developed away from G'd's likeness.

At the same time the Torah wanted to stress an essential difference between G'd and man. Whereas G'd does not procreate, man and woman, though G'd-like in some respects, were meant to procreate. The Torah continues to repeat that G'd had blessed mankind and called their combined name ADAM, to show that He had equipped man with all the advantages possible.

Whereas G'd frequently cancels an evil decree due to considerations of His attribute of Mercy, in this case G'd announced that the decree was irrevocable. Normally, G'd applies the attribute of Mercy because He keeps in mind that man is a mixture of flesh and spirit. In this particular case G'd gave notice <span class=\"font1\">בשגם הוא בשר</span>, that the decree was final although man is also flesh.",
                    "Still another meaning addresses G'd's practice of paying the reward or punishment in the Hereafter, the righteous receiving his share in that world and the wicked descending to Gehinom. In this case, G'd gave notice to the wicked that they would not be judged <b>after</b> death but that since they had tainted their spirit as much as their flesh their spirit would also undergo the afflictions normally reserved only for the flesh. The 120 years G'd speaks about is the period needed to allow the righteous of that generation such as Methuselah to live out their allotted lifespan in full. The <i>Zohar</i> on Genesis 7,22 explained: \"all that had a soul of living spirit in its nostrils, of all that were on dry land died,\" as a reference to the righteous who died <b>on dry land,</b> before the onset of the deluge.",
                    "Another message contained in our verse is that henceforth G'd would never again apply the attribute of Mercy <b>exclusively.</b> The verse is introduced with G'd speaking in His capacity of the attribute of Mercy, <span class=\"font1\">ויאמר השם</span>. It switches immediately to tell us that His spirit, i.e. that of mercy would not anymore abide in this world completely. G'd attributed part of the corruption in His world to His having exercised too much mercy. He had allowed man to indulge his greed too much. From now on G'd reserved more of His mercy for the Hereafter. As a result of this change of emphasis, even such a righteous man as our patriarch Jacob was not allowed to enjoy the benefits of this world in tranquillity. As soon as Jacob set out to so so, he experienced all the trouble with his favourite son Joseph (compare Rashi on Genesis 37,2)."

G'd regretted that He had made man on earth.</b> Why was the evil man did connected to \"the earth?\" The wording of the Torah gives the impression that man perpetrated evil deeds on the body of the earth, whereas their wickedness consisted primarily of violence and sexual perversions as per 6,11-12. While it is justified to describe the theft of land as violence and evil perpetrated on the earth, this is a mere technicality, a minor detail. Why did the Torah not simply say: \"G'd regretted having made man,\" instead of saying that \"G'd regretted having made man <b>on earth</b>?\" This leads us to believe that if only G'd had made man elsewhere He would not now have had reason to regret it. Surely this is not what the Torah meant to tell us!",
                    "How do we understand G'd's \"regretting\" anything? Did not Bileam describe G'd (Numbers 23,19) as not ever regretting anything! Besides, what is the point of describing G'd as \"saddened?\" If this feeling had to be mentioned at all, it should have been mentioned <b>after</b> G'd had carried out His revenge on all the rebellious human beings and had wiped them out. The Torah addresses itself to the four elements man is composed of, fire, air, water and dust. These elements differ in importance and value, the lowliest one being dust seeing it is murky, opaque. The next higher category is water, followed by fire, followed by air or spirit which is the highest ranking of these elements. Although all creatures contain all four elements, different elements predominate in different creatures. The fish are made mostly of water, the birds mostly of air; this is why they can fly and hardly need to rest on earth. The salamander is a creature in which the element of fire predominates. Man is the only creature in which the lowest of the element, dust, predominates. The Torah reported G'd as having fashioned man \"dust from the earth\" (2,7). This accounts for man's primary habitat being earth. Man cannot live permanently either in the air, the water, or in fire. G'd had numerous reasons for arranging things in this way, one of them being the concept of <span class=\"font1\">מדרגות וסולם</span>, that the universe consists of different levels and a ladder. In order for man to rise from one level to another it is important that the ladder which is the means for that spiritual ascent be firmly planted on earth. ",
                    "When G'd observed that man's wickedness kept increasing, He realised that the fact that man was based on the lowest of the four elements was one of the causes. Also, his habitat was on earth which consists largely of the element of dust. This is the meaning of G'd saying that He saw that man's wickedness <b>on earth</b> had increased greatly. This is why G'd \"regretted\" not having made man primarily of a more refined element. The Torah prefaced G'd's \"regret\" by stating that man's thoughts were only concerned with evil all day long, and He attributed this to the fact that man was not made predominantly of one of the more refined elements. G'd's \"sadness\" refers to the impediments that man's raw material posed to his attaining the objectives His Creator had planned for him. This is why the Torah did not say <span class=\"font1\">ויתעצב <b>בלבו</b></span>, but <span class=\"font1\">ויתעצב <b>אל לבו</b></span>. The word <span class=\"font1\"><b>אל</b></span> alludes to the ambitions G'd had harboured for man when He created him  G'd did not want to change the ambitions He had entertained for man for reasons best known to Him; this is why He did not redesign man from one of the other three elements but rather allowed almost the whole species to perish in order to persevere with His original plan. Man's corruption did cause a severe setback to G'd's hopes and timetable. While it is perfectly true that the term \"He regretted\" is not appropriate for the Creator who has foreseen everything, the Torah is entitled to use the term because of the twin attribute of Mercy and Justice that G'd manifests. When man acts in accordance with the wishes of His Creator the attribute of Justice agrees to G'd giving predominance to His attribute of Mercy. When man rebels, the reverse is the case. Our verse describes that the attribute of Mercy preferred that man had never been made instead of agreeing that man should now be judged by the attribute of Justice. G'd was \"saddened\" as this was not sufficient reason to consider the whole universe as a failure, a wasted effort.",
                    "We may also understand the passage in connection with what Maimonides wrote in chapter 5 of his <span class=\"font1\">הלכות תשובה</span>. \"G'd and His knowledge are one and the same [not like man whose perceptive powers are outside his essence. Ed.]. We are unable to understand this properly, just as we lack comprehension of how G'd can know every detail of the future without such knowledge robbing man of his freedom of decision. All we know as a certainty is that G'd does not interfere with man's free choice. The <span class=\"font1\">ראב\"ד</span>, with characteristic lack of deference, adds that Maimonides is incorrect, that G'd's perceptions are similar to someone foretelling the future by means of a horoscope. Maimonides is surely closer to the truth as G'd's perceptions cannot be compared to man's. Who would dare suggest that G'd obtains knowledge from outside sources, through trial and error and all the other methods used by us to define the character of what we see, hear, or touch. G'd is able to deny, i.e. totally ignore and remain unaffected by knowledge He had previously acquired. It is this the <span class=\"font1\">רמב\"ם</span> had in mind when he wrote that man cannot comprehend the manner in which G'd perceives. When Bileam declared (Numbers 23,21) that G'd had not seen any iniquity in Jacob, he referred to exactly this ability of G'd to <b>totally</b> ignore something that He knew was going to occur in the future.",
                    "We can therefore say that at the time G'd created man He totally excluded from His conscious mind all and any sins that man would ever commit. He did so for two reasons. 1) G'd is good and does not dwell on evil. This reason does not suffice, however, because G'd needs to know what will happen and what will be the ultimate outcome of what happens now. 2) G'd excludes such future events from His consciousness so that the wicked cannot claim they had been programmed by G'd due to His omniscience, and that therefore they are not culpable for their evil deeds. The wicked believe in what we call \"self-fulfilling prophecies,\" and they consider G'd's foreknowledge as belonging to that category. This concept is part of the verse (1,31): \"G'd looked at all He had done and here it was very good.\" G'd \"saw\" i.e. foresaw, <b>only</b> what was good, i.e. the deeds of the righteous. Of course you will ask: \"if so how could G'd punish someone for a deed that He had not seen?\" The Torah tells us that at at this point in time G'd chose to look at the deeds of the wicked; what He saw caused Him to regret that He had for so long ignored these deeds in order that His knowledge would not become a self-fulfilling prophecy."

This would comprise all the people under twenty years of age. If the decree was due to G'd's regret at having made man at all, everybody would be included in the decree. In view of the fact that the Torah tells us through the repeated use of the word <span class=\"font1\">נחמתי</span> that every human being was included in the decree, the Torah had to continue immediately and tell us that there was one single exception, namely Noach. The Torah tells us that Noach \"found favour in the eyes of G'd,\" i.e. <b>not</b> on account of his deeds. Once G'd had decided that He \"regretted\" having made man Noach's good deeds would have had no impact on his fate. He needed an act of grace by G'd to save him. The fact that G'd granted Noach grace does not mean that he did not deserve to survive based on his good deeds. There are certain categories of <span class=\"font1\">מצות</span>, good deeds, which secure a person grace in the eyes of G'd. G'd has deliberately refrained from telling us which <span class=\"font1\">מצות</span> fall into that category because otherwise everybody would merely concentrate on performing those commandments."

                    "<b> <span class=\"font1\">אלה תולדת נח</span>, Theses are the generations of Noach.</b> When the Torah uses the term \"these,\" it usually intends to exclude something, i.e. \"these generations and not any others.\" In this instance there was no need for the Torah to use the term \"these,\" as we already know that all the generations were doomed. For this reason the sages understand the word to teach us that the <b>principal</b> \"generations,\" i.e. descendants of a person, are man's good deeds. They therefore read the verse as if there were no comma between the words <span class=\"font1\">נח, נח</span> to indicate that Noach's descendants were his good deeds (<i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 30,6). The <i>Midrash</i> was careful to say that the \"principal\" descendants of the righteous are their good deeds; naturally they also have <b>other</b> descendants. When the good deeds of Noach are described by the word <span class=\"font1\">אלה</span>, this is only in contrast with those of the word <span class=\"font1\">תולדת</span> at the beginning of chapter 5.",
                    "Another meaning of the sequence <span class=\"font1\">נח נח</span>, is illustrated in an imaginary conversation between Moses and Noach reported in <i>Devarim Rabbah</i> 11,3. In that conversation Noach claimed to have been greater than Moses because he was saved during the deluge. Moses retorted that Noach had not been able to save anyone other than himself, whereas he had saved his generation after the sin of the golden calf. The word <span class=\"font1\">אלה</span> accordingly describes the limited value of Noach's good deeds. They sufficed only to save himself. The additional word <span class=\"font1\">בדורתיו</span> further underlines that Noach did not succeed to make penitents out of his peers. His sons who were considered as his \"branches\" are therefore included in the name Noach. The Torah accords Noach a compliment which it did not accord to righteous people who had lived before his time. Noach's righteous predecessors all had other righteous people to model themselves after, something that did not apply to Noach. He grew up surrounded only by wicked people. The word <span class=\"font1\">אלה</span> therefore also has a positive connotation in that it sets Noach's pious conduct apart from all those who had preceded him.",
                    "There is another message contained in this verse which is commented upon in <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 25,2. The Midrash discusses whether Noach's name was in itself blissful, or whether in view of Noach's righteous way of life the blessings he conferred on earth were subsequently reflected in his name. Here is some of the discussion: \"When G'd created Adam He invested him with a full range of authority. The cow obeyed the ploughman, the furrow co-operated with the plough. As soon as Adam sinned, the cow no longer responded to its owner, nor did the earth respond to the plough. This situation continued until the time of Noach. Once Noach appeared on earth the situation changed in man's favour. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish added that until Noach the waters would flood the earth, something that stopped during Noach's time. At any rate, the name Noach is repeated in our verse to indicate the beneficial effect his existence had on the well being of his peers. The repetition of the word <span class=\"font1\">תולדת</span> and the use of the word <span class=\"font1\">איש</span> are an allusion to the fact that Noach was <span class=\"font1\">איש האדמה</span>, an outstanding farmer (as is stated explicitly after the deluge (9,20). Our sages (<i>Tanchuma Bereshit</i> 11) find Noach's successful impact on farming alluded to in 5,29 where his father Lemech predicts that his son Noach will provide relief for <span class=\"font1\">עצבון ידינו</span>, \"the painful labour of our hands.\" The fact that Noach was born without a foreskin gave rise to these hopes. Apparently Noach invented a usable plough. The word <span class=\"font1\"><b>צדיק</b></span> hints that the righteous is the foundation of the universe, that without a righteous person the universe would forfeit its reason for existence. But for Noach the earth would have perished at the time of the deluge. The word <b><span class=\"font1\">חמים</span></b> should be understood in the same vein as the Talmud <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 10 explains it. The Talmud understands the word <span class=\"font1\">צדיק</span> as a reference to Noach's deeds, whereas the word <span class=\"font1\">תמים</span> is a reference to Noach's lifestyle, his attitudes [as opposed to understanding the word as an adjective describing his righteousness. Ed.] All of this is additional praise for Noach who was able to perfect his personality in the face of such wicked contemporaries. Noach did far more than could have been expected of him. Our sages call such conduct <span class=\"font1\">לפנים משורת הדין</span>. According to Samuel II, 22,27 G'd acts loyally with the loyal, whereas He uses wile in dealing with the perverse. According to this yardstick Noach would have been free to do likewise, but he chose to be more considerate than required by law. When the Torah describes Noach's perfection as <span class=\"font1\">בדורותיו</span> this means that his goodness was recognised even by the people of his time. The plural in the expression <span class=\"font1\">בדורותיו</span> reminds us that the average person's lifespan involves three generations. He lives during part of his father's generation, his contemporaries, and during part of his children's generation. Noach was unique during all these three generations; the only righteous member of a former generation that he shared time on earth with was his grandfather Methuselah. When the Torah tells us <span class=\"font1\">את האלוקים התהלך נח</span>, that Noach walked with G'd, this means that even vis a vis G'd Noach's conduct was very constructive. Our sages tell us in connection with Noach's offering after the deluge (8,21) <span class=\"font1\">וירח השם את ריח ה<b>ניחוח</b></span>, that Noach's name is alluded to in the word <span class=\"font1\">ניחוח</span>. The reason the Torah repeats the name Noach at the beginning is to refer to this second dimension of Noach's beneficial effect on mankind, when G'd decided not to bring another deluge ever, due to Noach's gratitude. The reason the Torah uses the verb <span class=\"font1\">הלך</span> when describing Noach's conduct vis-a-vis G'd is because G'd describes a desirable conduct by man in those terms in Deut. 28,9. When the Torah here employs the reflexive <span class=\"font1\">התהלך</span>, this merely emphasises that Noach <b>kept</b> walking with G'd. He provided pleasure to His Creator all the time, something which found its ultimate expression in his sacrifice after the deluge."

                    "<b> <span class=\"font1\">ויולד נח שלשה בנים</span>. Noach fathered three sons.</b> Why did the Torah have to repeat here that Noach fathered three sons when we have been told this already in 5,32? The mention of the number \"three\" seems quite superfluous in view of the fact that the Torah tells us the name of each son. Surely we can count up to three! Why did Noach's name have to be repeated? No one else is the subject here! The word <span class=\"font1\">בנים</span>, sons, also seems superfluous. All the Torah had to write was: \"Noach fathered Shem, Cham, and Yephet.\" Why did the Torah add the word <span class=\"font1\">את</span> in front of each of the names?",
                    "In view of our explanation that the Torah considered Noach's good deeds his principal descendants, and that it was on that account that Noach had found favour in the eyes of G'd, our verse is necessary. Had the Torah failed to repeat the information contained in 5,32, we would not have considered his three sons as a positive accomplishment on Noach's part. The Torah does not report anything positive or negative about these sons. We would have thought these three sons as unfit either on account of their own poor characters or because Noach had not fathered them in order to fulfil G'd's commandment. The Torah therefore lists the birth of these three sons immediately after the list of Noach's good deeds so as to include them in that list. I have found in the <i>Midrash</i> that Noach foresaw that his sons would anger G'd and as a result he decided there was no point in siring children during the first five hundred years of his life. At that point G'd commanded Noach to marry and to have children. He had children in order to keep alive the human species. I believe that this Midrash interpreted the words <span class=\"font1\">את האלוקים התהלך נח</span> to mean that Noach thought he was approaching death; therefore he sired children before it was too late. Another meaning of these words could be that Noach realised he would soon be judged by the attribute of Justice for failing to have sired children. This is why he hastened to get married and to sire children to rectify his sin of omission. Another reason for Noach's tardiness in marrying and raising a family (according to several <i>Midrashim</i>) is that G'd commanded Noach to build the ark when he was 480 years old. The deluge would occur in another 120 years. In those days children were not held accountable for their sins until they were one hundred years old. Noach wanted to insure that when the deluge came his children deserved to be saved because they had not reached the age when G'd held them responsible for their deeds. Hence he waited until he was 500 years old before he sired any children (Compare <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 26,2 based on Isaiah 65,20). Accordingly, Noach's eldest son would be under 100 years old at the beginning of the deluge.",
                    "The reason Noach's name is mentioned once more a) is to demonstrate again that he brought a new-found <span class=\"font1\">מנוחה</span> rest or satisfaction to life on earth, b) to remind us that were it not for their father, these sons would not have been saved. Surely there were many youngsters below the age of one hundred at the time the deluge started and none of those were spared. I refer the reader to my comment on the words: \"I have seen you to be a righteous person in this generation (7,1).\" The three times <span class=\"font1\">את</span> which appeared at first glance as superfluous refer to the wives of Noach's sons who were also saved only on account of Noach. If the sons of Noach per se did not warrant saving, why did G'd consider it necessary to repeat the report of the three sons that were born to Noach prior to the deluge?",
                    "We have to fall back on <i>Sanhedrin</i> 69 where the Talmud proves that the list of Noach's sons presented by the Torah is not according to their seniority but is based on the sons' relative intelligence. Shem is mentioned first as he was the most intelligent. If this were not so he could not have been described as one hundred years old when he sired Arpachshad two years after the deluge (11,10). If the Torah had not mentioned the extra word <span class=\"font1\">בנים</span>, but had merely given their names, we would have concluded that the list of their names was according to the order of their births."

If the Torah only wanted to spell out details of man's sins, this too had been spelled out in greater detail in the previous passage. If the Torah wanted to add the element of violence perpetrated by man on earth, that is all that needed mentioning here. Besides, why did the Torah switch to the use of the name <span class=\"font1\">אלוקים</span>, the attribute of Justice, whereas in 6,5 G'd's attribute of Mercy is used? What do the words <span class=\"font1\">לפני האלוקים</span> in our verse add to our understanding? Why does the Torah repeat once more in 6,12 that \"G'd saw, etc.?\" The Torah certainly did not need to tell us that G'd had become aware of man's sins, as we all know that He is aware of all this?",
                    "We must understand the passage along the lines of the <i>Mishnah Avot</i> 4,11 that when a person violates a single commandment he acquires one accuser for himself. The \"accuser\" is to be understood as a destructive power (angel). This destructive power is not unleashed until the Supreme Judge of the whole universe has given a verdict concerning the person guilty of a misdemeanour. This is the deeper meaning of every time the Torah speaks about a sinner \"<b>carrying</b> his guilt\" (Leviticus 5,17 et al). Once G'd has pronounced judgment, He unleashes these accumulated destructive forces. When the prophet Jeremiah 2,19 says: <span class=\"font1\">תיסרך רעתך</span>, \"your wickedness will discipline you,\" he refers to these destructive forces which our sins have created and which G'd unleashes after having judged us. We have to appreciate that although G'd holds the accuser in check so that he cannot yet harm us, this applies only as long as our sins are relatively few or minor. If our sins keep accumulating, they exert pressure on the Heavenly Court so that the perpetrator of the sin may find himself the victim of some of these accusers even before final judgment has been decreed upon him. When the Torah speaks of \"the earth had become corrupted before G'd,\" this means that <b>before</b> G'd had completed judging everyone individually, the collective total of the destructive powers created by man's sins was such that the destructive forces already dominated the earth. The reason the Torah speaks about <span class=\"font1\">הארץ</span> is to tell us that the corruption had penetrated earth itself.",
                    "The Torah said in the previous verse: \"the earth had become full of this corruption in the form of violence.\" Why did the Torah reverse this sequence? It should first have stated what G'd saw, and afterwards the extent of the corruption. As it is, the Torah tells us of the effect before telling us of the cause! The inverted method of reporting is to emphasise that even after the earth had already become full of corruption, all of which is subsumed under the heading \"violence,\" man added further abominations to those already perpetrated. Although it is G'd's virtue to forgive or suspend punishment (<span class=\"font1\">נושא עון</span>) until the time He sits in judgment, the sins of this generation were such that G'd could no longer practice this virtue. It was somewhat similar to when Cain had said to G'd that he found his penalty too hard to bear. He had used the term <span class=\"font1\">גדול עוני מנשוא</span>, \"is my guilt too great to forgive (4,13)?\" Alternatively, the words <span class=\"font1\">ותשחת הארץ</span> refer to the actual deeds, which caused the earth to become full of destructive agents all of which are described as <span class=\"font1\">חמס</span>. G'd informed Noach (6,13) of this when He told him that <span class=\"font1\">קץ כל בשר בא לפני</span>, that \"the end for all flesh is approaching.\" According to the <i>Zohar</i> this means that the destructive forces created by man's sins which are called <span class=\"font1\">קץ</span> have appeared before G'd demanding the speedy destruction of the perpetrators of all this evil. The Torah tells us for how long G'd restrained the attribute of Justice. This is why we have <b>repeated</b> references to G'd's awareness of man's wickedness ever since 6,5. When the Torah here finally uses the word <span class=\"font1\">אלוקים</span> to describe G'd, it is to give notice that the attribute of Mercy itself had turned into one demanding that justice be done.",
                    "<b><span class=\"font1\">ותמלא הארץ חמס</span>.</b> The earth was filled with violence. There is a <i>Midrash</i> which illustrates the violence perpetrated by describing how people each helped themselves to a lupine out of a bowl that was set on the table. The Rabbis could not understand why the example mentioned shows that mankind was exterminated for a robbery involving such a minute amount. According to halachah theft of an amount worth less than a <span class=\"font1\">פרוטה</span>, a certain small coin, is not subject to prosecution! I believe that the <i>Midrash</i> wanted to demonstrate that not only were the people of that generation guilty of violating all the seven Noachide commandments, but of something additional. They were sophisticated enough to engage in the kind of theft that was not subject to prosecution because the stolen goods came into their possession indirectly. According to Maimonides chapter nine of <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> even merely withholding wages from a labourer was subject to the death penalty in those days. Nonetheless the people of that generation were astute enough to borrow, i.e. to secure themselves credit and to draw on these credits in amounts of less than the value of the coin mentioned. This did not make them subject to prosecution if they failed to repay the credits. According to others it did not constitute robbery as long as the object was given to them willingly by its owner.

If however, the word <span class=\"font1\">חמס</span> refers to robbery with violence (compare Rashi based on <i>Sanhedrin</i> 108), why would the victims of the robbery suffer the same fate as the perpetrators of the crime?",
                    "Although one might answer that everybody indulged in robbery, each one according to what he thought he could get away with, our sages (<i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 23,9) have explained the matter differently when they said that in any society in which sexual licentiousness abounds retribution will strike both the wicked and the good people. Therefore we must understand our verse as saying that though the decree to destroy mankind was <b>sealed</b> because of the prevalence of robbery with violence, the fact that amongst all the sins there were many instances of sexual licentiousness and promiscuity resulted in the retribution including also those who were innocent of robbery. You may ask that all these people could have saved themselves from Divine retribution by each one forgiving the other? As a result of this G'd would not have sealed the evil decree! Perhaps G'd did not want to reveal the effectiveness of mutual forgiveness to anyone but Noach. Noach in turn was not able to reveal this secret to his contemporaries seeing that unless G'd tells a person to communicate revelations made to him to others, such revelations are confidential communications from G'd. One of the reasons G'd did not want this secret revealed to Noach's contemporaries may have been that they all remained guilty of having committed robbery. The sin of robbery cannot be atoned for by simply offering the sinner your forgiveness without making restitution. Although the <i>Midrash</i> mentioned types of robbery which are not subject to prosecution, these types of robbery were not the only ones perpetrated by the people of Noach's time. The people of that generation indulged in every form of robbery. Whenever they confronted someone stronger than themselves they resorted to the kind of trickery described by the <i>Midrash.</i> Otherwise they had no qualms about simply grabbing what they fancied.",
                    "The reason G'd explained to Noach exactly what sins prompted Him to decree destruction of the species was to motivate him to build the ark so that all living creatures could be preserved until after the deluge.",
                    "Next we must explain what prompted Noach not to ask G'd to have mercy on the people of his time (as did Abraham when G'd told him He would destroy Sodom). It appears that Abraham learned from Noach not to bother to ask that G'd spare a city when there were fewer than ten good people in it. Unless he had learned this from Noach, who told Abraham that it would be futile to pray for the survival of a city which contained fewer than ten righteous people?",
                    "Noach became convinced from what G'd told him that any prayer of his would be futile, that the fate of these people had been sealed beyond reprieve. All of this is contained in the words: \"the end of all flesh has come before Me, here I am about to destroy them.\" When G'd told Abraham (Genesis 18,20-21) about the sinful nature of the people of Sodom He did not use such kind of language at all. On the contrary, He told Abraham that He was going to examine if what had come to His attention was indeed so, etc. While it is true that in the case of Sodom G'd carried out His decree as soon as He had <i>confirmed</i> the true state of affairs, G'd wanted to demonstrate to Abraham that He does not exercise His power arbitrarily. We have explained in that connection that G'd spoke to Abraham in a manner that invited him to pray on behalf of the doomed cities. Something similar occurred during the episode of the golden calf when G'd proclaimed His intent to wipe out the Jewish people in such a way that Moses saw an opening for his prayer. None of these openings were provided for Noach.",
                    "One cannot argue that if G'd did not want Noach to pray for his contemporaries, He did not have to tell Noach what He was going to do and why. G'd needed to tell Noach in order that the latter build the ark. This commandment alone convinced Noach that it would be useless to pray on behalf of the people. Abraham concluded from the fact that Noach and his family were not enough to save the earth from the deluge that fewer than ten good people could not save a town from destruction."

                    "<b> <span class=\"font1\">עשה לך תבת עצי גפר</span>. Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood.</b> In order to understand this verse fully we must refer to Ezekiel 14,14 where the prophet speaks of three men, i.e. Noach, Daniel, and Job who managed to save their own lives due to their personal piety. The prophet there claims that G'd had told him that even if all these three pious men were alive in Jerusalem at that time they could not save the city from disaster though they personally would be saved. The reason all three of these pious men are mentioned is to teach us that even two of them together would not suffice to save themselves at that time in Jerusalem. Some of the earlier commentators wondered that in view of the many pious people who perished during the destruction of the Temple (compare Psalms 79,2 \"they have left Your servants' corpses etc.\"), how was it that if three pious people could have saved <b>themselves</b> that the far more numerous number of pious people who died during the destruction of the city did not manage to save themselves? One of the answers given is that each pious person may have been scattered amongst many sinners, whereas if three pious persons had stuck together they would certainly have been saved by their merits. This may have been the reason that Noach could only be saved after building the ark, i.e. providing a separate environment for himself. As long as he had been surrounded by his compatriots without a <span class=\"font1\">מחיצה</span>, dividing wall, he would have been swept away together with them. If Noach had had a few more pious people with him, he and they would have been saved without the need to construct their own environment. Under such circumstances the verse in Psalms 94,15 <span class=\"font1\">עד צדק ישוב משפט</span>, that under certain circumstances righteousness could have reversed judgment, would have been applicable. From the fact that Noach was required to build an ark we learn that his sons did not match him in piety. Had they done so, Noach would not have needed to construct the ark but would have been saved in his own habitat. We need to reconcile this with the words of our sages which I have quoted earlier, and according to which Abraham learned from Noach that it was futile to pray for a city with fewer than ten righteous people to be saved. If Noach was the <b>only</b> righteous man in his generation what could Abraham have learned from this? We must therefore assume that though Noach's sons were righteous they were not perfectly righteous people such as their father. When Abraham prayed about righteous people being able to save a town he meant perfectly righteous people, not those whose good deeds barely outweighed their sins. This is the reason that Ezekiel listed the names of outstandingly righteous men such as Noach, Daniel, and Job. He did not refer to three average type <span class=\"font1\">צדיקים</span>. We learn from Ezekiel that once the destructive agents have been given permission by G'd to carry out their function, who and under what circumstances someone can restrain them."

After this G'd commanded Noach to enter the ark under the protection of this covenant. Although the covenant is not mentioned again in connection with 7,1, G'd relied on His previous assurance to Noach in this regard. The covenant is alluded to again in 8,1 where G'd is reported as \"remembering\" all those in the ark.

Why does the Torah use this peculiar order? Perhaps the birds enjoy a certain distinction over the mammals because they multiply so profusely. It is interesting that only the \"pure\" birds multiply so profusely; the 24 categories of \"impure\" birds which are not fit for consumption by Jews do not multiply as profusely. We have a tradition (<i>Chulin</i> 63?) according to which 120 varieties of birds were found on the Temple Mount, all of which are sub-categories of the <span class=\"font1\">איה</span>, the falcon.

He referred to man dying ahead of the animals during the deluge. Who needed Rabbi Ami to tell us something that the Torah has already spelled out in 7,23? Actually, when you look at verse 21 you notice that the death of the creatures is reported in the reverse order, i.e. first the animals, then the human beings. According to our interpretation there is no contradiction here. Whereas verse 21 discusses the timing of the deaths, verse 23 discusses the dissolution of the remains of the dead creatures.

What exactly is the meaning of: \"it went to and fro until the water on the earth dried out?\" If the meaning is that the raven could not find a place to rest outside the ark and that therefore it kept re-entering the ark and leaving anew, why was there a need to send out a dove altogether? Did not the raven's behaviour indicate that the waters had not yet eased sufficiently? What exactly does the Torah mean by the words <span class=\"font1\">עד יבשת המים</span>? Furthermore, did Noach not have sufficient information once he sent out the dove? Why does the Torah not mention that Noach extended his hand to bring the raven back, just as it does in connection with the dove in verse 9?",

This is why he expelled the raven from the ark as soon as he opened its window. This is why the Torah does not mention that the raven was despatched in order to examine the extent to which the waters had receded. The raven was forced to remain outside the ark though it tried to return to it. This situation continued until the waters on the earth had dried out. When Noach wanted to know how far the waters had receded he sent out the dove. He had not been able to find this out from the raven which he had expelled. The dove was willing to undertake the mission of relaying information to Noach. Initially, the dove reported that it had not been able to find a place to rest. As soon as Noach heard this he took the dove back into the ark with him. The detailed wording of verse 9 suggests that Noach made a special place in the ark for the dove. Later on Noach sent out the same dove a second time.",
                    "Our sages derived another lesson from the wording of this verse when they stated (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 108) that the raven used an ironclad argument when it accused both G'd and Noach of hating it. It said: \"G'd hates me because only a single pair of my species has been allowed into the ark whereas the \"pure\" birds are represented by seven pairs. You hate me because you endangered me instead of one of the birds of which there are seven pairs.\" The raven went on to suspect Noach of personal motives in sending it on a mission so that Noach could have relations with its mate. Noach was very angry, telling the raven that since he refrained from having inter-course with is own wife in the ark he most certainly would not dream of mating with a species that was forbidden to him. According to this aggadah the raven refused to undertake the mission Noach wanted to assign to it for fear of its species becoming extinct should anything happen to it outside the ark. As a result, Noach had to send the dove on the mission originally planned for the raven. The raven's very fear and constant circling of the ark told Noach that the waters were still covering most of the earth. What Noach did not know was whether the water level on earth was already substantially lower. He sent out the dove to find out this information.",
                    "The deeper meaning of the aggadah depicting the raven's confrontation with Noach can be understood in terms of Psalms 69,27: \"For they persecute those whom You have struck.\" Normally, those who have been persecuted can expect to encounter mercy and pity. The people who persecute Jews in exile heap more suffering on those already in unfortunate circumstances. This was basically the raven's argument against Noach when it said: \"is it not enough that Your Master hates me, must you hate me also?\" The raven continued: \"if you are not motivated by hatred of me, do you have designs on my mate and wish me out of the way?\" The raven implied that precisely because Noach was not allowed to have sexual relations with his wife in the ark, he might have reasoned that he could have relations with other species. There is no reason to question why the raven's mate should be different from any other female animal. The raven's argument applied to all female animals, but seeing the others remained under their mates' supervision Noach would not be able to carry out such a design unseen. Only the female raven would be unprotected during its mate's absence from the ark.",
                    "The raven may also have extrapolated from the very fact that it had been guilty of mating in the ark. It reasoned that the fact that Noach had seen this take place had aroused his instincts. Our sages have always claimed that watching something arouses one's greed and lust to possess the object one has watched. This is why the sages have been so careful to forbid looking at parts of the body. Noach was angry at the raven for having referred to G'd only as Noach's \"Master,\" not it's own. This is why he called the raven \"wicked.\" Concerning the suspicion that Noach had designs on the raven's mate, Noach retorted that seeing he had been able to restrain himself from sleeping with his own wife, something which was only a simple prohibition, he could certainly restrain himself from sleeping with the raven's mate, something that involved violating two prohibitions.",
                    "Another reason that prompted Noach to call the raven \"wicked\" in that aggadah is that Noach applied the principle <span class=\"font1\">כל הפוסל במומו פוסל</span>, that \"when someone accuses others of moral shortcomings, he usually accuses the outsider of a moral defect that he himself is guilty of\" (<i>Kidushin</i> 70). Noach told the raven it could never have suspected him of what it did unless it was guilty of such misdemeanours itself. The reason the Talmud describes the raven's argument as <span class=\"font1\">ניצחת</span>, ironclad, is that Noach could not answer why he had picked for this mission a bird of which there was only a single pair.",
                    "Another reason why Noach called the raven wicked could be that seeing it had impregnated its mate already, the species would not die out even if some accident were to befall the male raven on its mission. Its very wickedness therefore had made the raven the only expendable bird."

He bases himself on <i>Shavuot</i> 36. This poses a problem, seeing that the sages do not really say this. This is the text of the Talmud: Rabbi Eliezer said the word <span class=\"font1\">לא</span> is a term used as an oath; the word <span class=\"font1\">הן</span> is also a term used as an oath; Rabbi Eliezer quotes some verse as proof. Rava corrects his statement by saying that only when these words are used twice do they constitute an oath. Rava quotes Genesis 9,11 <span class=\"font1\"><b>ולא</b> יכרת כל בשר עוד ממי המבול <b>ולא</b> יהיה עוד מבול</span>, all flesh will <b>not again be annihilated by the waters of the deluge, nor will there ever be another flood,</b> as proof for his rule. The fact that Rava quotes this verse and not 8,21 shows that he means two separate verses or statements are needed. The single verse in 8,21 does not constitute an oath according to the Talmud.",
                    "The Talmud is quite correct in not using the repeated words <span class=\"font1\">לא אוסיף</span> as an oath where G'd is reported as saying this \"to His heart.\" In that verse the words <span class=\"font1\">לא אוסיף</span> were applied to two different undertakings by G'd. He promised not to curse the earth, and He promised not to curse all the living creatures. It would not be proper to speak of a repetition then. What G'd undertook in this verse was not to punish the earth again on account of man's deeds as He had done when Adam sinned and when Cain sinned. Not even a part of the earth would henceforth be cursed on account of man's actions or inactions. In addition G'd expressed His satisfaction with Noach's sacrifice and promised not to smite whole categories of creatures even when this did not involve destroying their habitat. It is clear then that there is no oath here since G'd did not repeat anything. That is why Rava in the Talmud uses the verse in 9,11 as an example of an oath. We will explain that verse in detail in its proper place. Perhaps Rashi had a different version of the Talmud as suggested by the commentary of the <span class=\"font1\">רא׳ש</span> on that folio.",
                    "We still need to supply a reason why the verse once mentions the curse before the word <span class=\"font1\">עוד</span>, i.e. <span class=\"font1\">לא אוסיף לקלל <b>עוד</b></span>, whereas in the second half of the verse the sequence is <span class=\"font1\">ולא אוסיף <b>עוד</b> להכות</span>, the word <span class=\"font1\">עוד</span> already appearing before the predicate of the sentence. The reason is that a curse directed at the earth already has a past history, i.e. earth has been cursed before and the effects of that curse still existed. When G'd curses living creatures there is no noticeable effect of any previous curse as any living creatures that had been cursed or smitten prior to the present curse were already dead and as if they had never existed. Our verse incorporates this nuance. It reminds us that the earth was still suffering from the effect of previous curses.",
                    "<b><span class=\"font1\">כי יצר לב האדם רע מנעוריו</span>, for the inclination of man's heart is evil from its youth.</b> This statement is best understood as similar to the Talmud <i>Baba Kama</i> 39. The Talmud discusses an incidence in which a bull trained to perform in an arena has gored someone. Such an animal is not subject to the death penalty as it only did what it was expected to do. The reason cited in that <i>Mishnah</i> is that the Torah uses the future tense <span class=\"font1\">יגח</span> in Exodus 21,28 when providing the death penalty for oxen which gore a human being. Animals which have been trained to do just that are not culpable for doing what comes naturally. Similarly, man, equipped as he is with an evil instinct from birth, is not culpable until he has learned to distinguish right from wrong. This rule applies to minors not being subject to the judiciary process. They are, however, punishable by G'd for not having heeded His call. In that respect man is not like the bull we mentioned. Man's advantage over the beasts is his knowledge of good and evil. He is charged with despising evil and choosing what is good. The fact that man was born with the <span class=\"font1\">יצר הרע</span> only, acts like an extenuating circumstance protecting him against G'd's anger."

There may have been three reasons why Noach was permitted to eat meat. 1) His care for the animals during a whole year in the ark kept the whole species alive. 2) He expended a great deal of tender care on these animals. It is with regard to this that the Psalmist 128,2 says: <span class=\"font1\">יגיע כפיך כי תאכל אשריך וטוב לך</span>. \"When you eat what you have laboured for with your hands, you will be happy and well off.\" 3) G'd was in a favourable frame of mind having promised not to destroy all flesh.

We can now understand the statement in <i>Shabbat</i> 41 that if someone takes hold of his member and ejaculates, this is tantamount to his bringing a deluge on the world.

They ignored 8,21 in that context. I have explained all that in connection with 8,21.",
                    "Perhaps we need to understand this verse in light of what the Talmud says in <i>Sotah</i> 11. The Talmud there questions why the Torah used the singular when speaking of the Jewish nation in Exodus 1,10. Why did the Torah say <span class=\"font1\">הבה נתחכמה <b>לו</b></span>, \"let us outsmart <b>it</b>,\" instead of <span class=\"font1\">הבה נתחכמה <b>להם</b></span>, \"let us outsmart <b>them</b>.\" Rabbi Chamah says there that the pronoun <span class=\"font1\">לו</span> refers to the saviour of the Jewish people, i.e. to G'd. The Egyptians wanted to kill the Jewish babies by drowning because G'd had sworn not to bring another deluge. The Egyptians were aware that G'd makes the punishment fit the crime and that therefore G'd's retribution would have to be by water. They were confident they could escape G'd's wrath because He had sworn not to bring on another deluge. They did not realise that G'd had only promised not to flood the <b>whole</b> earth at one time; G'd remained free to flood parts of the earth at any time. Besides, G'd's promise extended to the waters not \"descending\" upon man; if man decided to walk into the waters, as did the Egyptians in Exodus 14,27, this was not part of the oath at all. Thus far the Talmud in <i>Sotah.</i> According to the first statement in the verse <span class=\"font1\">לא יכרת כל בשר עוד ממי המבול</span>, G'd undertook not to bring on a flood which would engulf everybody; He was free to kill <b>part</b> of mankind by means of a flood; according to the second half of the verse G'd undertook not to destroy the earth itself even if He were forced to bring on a partial flood. The second half of the verse is a promise to earth, not to man. It would not have sufficed to write merely: \"there will not be another deluge.\" This is why the Torah adds: \"all flesh will not again be cut off by the waters of a deluge.\" According to this explanation the repeated \"<span class=\"font1\">לא</span>\" mentioned in our verse, which, according to Rava in <i>Shavuot</i> constitutes an oath, are the words <span class=\"font1\">לא יכרת</span> and <span class=\"font1\">לא יהיה</span>; it does not matter that the two \"<span class=\"font1\">לא</span>\" are followed by different verbs (<span class=\"font1\">יכרת</span> or <span class=\"font1\">יהיה</span>), as long as the oath applies to the same facts, i.e. no total deluge.

We must not worry as much about the exact parameters of G'd's oath, and whether destruction of earth by fire is included in the oath or not. What matters is that G'd reassured His creatures that the effort to procreate was not futile. Never again would a species or its habitat the earth, be subject to total annihilation. If G'd's oath would refer <b>only</b> to using water as the agent to destroy earth or mankind, the whole oath would not be worth very much.

                    "<b> <span class=\"font1\">ויהי כל הארץ שפה אחת</span>. The whole earth had a single language.</b> We must give some thought to the intent of the generation that built the Tower. What exactly did they mean to achieve by means of a city and a tower? If all they had in mind was to give expression to some aspect of heresy, how was that expressed by their building plans? If indeed their heresy was of a serious nature, their punishment, i.e. scattering them over the globe, seems an inadequate punishment. How would that punishment cure them of their heresy? The words <span class=\"font1\">ועתה לא יבצר מהם כל אשר יזמו לעשות</span>, \"Must not everything they are planning to do be withheld from them now?,\" are difficult. This line poses severe problems for a believer. Why did they say: \"we will build a city for <b>ourselves</b>?\" Who else was there to build a city for? Besides, did not G'd want mankind to construct a civilised universe? Surely He did not want a bunch of cave-dwellers?",
                    "If we accept the view of the sages that G'd intended one third of the earth to be under cultivation and civilisation, one third desert, and one third water, if you were to line up all the cities side by side even now several thousand years later, they would not cover one hundredth of a third of the available land mass! Most of the earth would remain desert, or at least uninhabited! It seems therefore that the roads linking one town or village to another are all considered as part of the \"built up\" areas that are to form approximately one third of the earth's surface. When the Torah reports that the people spoke one language and <span class=\"font1\">דברים אחדים</span>, were of one mind about all important issues, the meaning is that they literally congregated together without spreading out at all. To prevent becoming scattered they built a single city. They built the tower as a landmark so that if anyone of them strayed too far from home he would be able to orient himself by seeing the tower from a distance. The \"name\" the Torah speaks of is the \"name\" of the tower, i.e. its visibility from afar, its significance. It was this very reluctance to comply with G'd's intention to populate various parts of the earth which annoyed G'd. Had they not been endowed with free choice, they never could have defied G'd's plan for an evenly populated earth in this manner. G'd therefore had to resort to some stratagem to frustrate their plan without interfering with their basic freedom of choice. G'd achieved this by confusing their uniform language. Henceforth people who had a language in common would tend to congregate together, and as a result of a common language they would choose to live together. This could only be accomplished through their migrating from what used to be a central location, or what we are fond of calling \"the cradle of civilisation.\" G'd's whole purpose was to fill the earth with people. The sin of wanting to remain together in one location was almost as serious as outright heresy, being <span class=\"font1\">מקצץ הנטיעות</span>. While it is true that there are numerous mystical angles to this episode, and our sages elaborate on many of them, none of these explanations represent the plain meaning of the text."

Sarai remained barren, she had no child.</b> Why did the Torah have to add \"she had no child?\" Our sages (<i>Yevamot</i> 64) comment that she had no womb. The Talmud there elaborates that both Abraham and Sarah were congenital <span class=\"font1\">טומטמאים</span>, people with undeveloped genitals. The Talmud bases this on Isaiah 51,1: \"Look to the rock you were hewn from, to the quarry you were dug from. Look back to Abraham your father and to Sarah who brought you forth.\" Rashi comments there that \"hewn from\" and \"dug from\" refer to G'd having supplied male and female genitals to Abraham and Sarah (after they were adults). The Talmud also states there that when someone marries a woman and lives with her for ten years and she bears no children during that time, he should divorce her and pay her <span class=\"font1\">כתובה</span>, her marriage settlement. This is based on Genesis 16,3 where Sarah gave Hagar to Abraham to have children with after she had failed to bear children after ten years in the land of Israel. The Talmud questions why we do not rather take Isaac as an example. He lived with Rebeccah for at least twenty years and did not take another wife but prayed and as a result had children from Rebeccah. The Talmud answers that actually the reason the Torah mentions the number of years Abraham lived in the land of Israel before he married Hagar was to enable us to compute Ishmael's age in comparison to Isaac's. This also enables us to calculate Jacob's age during different periods of his life. Tossaphot comment that actually Isaac too waited only for ten years before he prayed, seeing that Rebeccah was three years old when he married her and her normal child-bearing years did not commence until after Isaac was married to her for ten years. Tossaphot concludes that a) not all <i>Midrashim</i> agree on the subject; b) in those days girls were able to bear children at a much younger age than nowadays. They also say that even assuming that Abraham had been born without visible genitals, by the time he married he had obviously developed in this respect. However, we must accept the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah who holds that once a <span class=\"font1\">טומטום</span>, such a person is unable to sire children even after his genitals have become visible. Of course, one must assume that Sarai's genitals too, had become visible by the time Abraham married her. [there is no good reason that Abraham a) would have married while suffering such a crucial physical blemish; b) that Sarah would have been given in marriage to anyone while she was similarly afflicted. Ed.] Even according to the view that once the genitals of a <span class=\"font1\">טומטום</span> have become visible he is no longer totally sterile, it is <b>unlikely</b> that such people will be capable of siring or bearing children. The Torah therefore adds the words <span class=\"font1\">אין לה ולד</span> in the case of Sarah to tell us that though she was no longer a <span class=\"font1\">טומטום</span>, her condition had not changed materially, and she still did not conceive.",
                    "Furthermore, Rabbi Yehudah is of the opinion that the rule that a <span class=\"font1\">טומטום</span> remains sterile even after his genitals become visible, applies only to the male. A female is quite likely to conceive once her genitals have been laid bare. According to this view our verse means that a) first Sarah was barren, i.e. her inability to conceive was not due to her genitals not being visible, a defect suffered by her husband but not by her. In her case it was simple barrenness that prevented her from giving birth. The Torah had to add the words <span class=\"font1\">אין לה ולד</span>, to teach us that this was not due to a visible deformity.",
                    "According to the view that she did not have a womb, we must understand the verse as follows: It turned out she was barren due to an invisible deformity, i.e. the lack of a womb. This deformity only came to light after her genitals had become visible, i.e. after her visible deformity had been cured. The expression <span class=\"font1\">ותהי</span> is not appropriate except for a new development, not for a condition which existed already, [many commentators do not share that view of the meaning of <span class=\"font1\">ותהי</span>.

When Terach realised that his son Abram did not beget children in Ur Casdim he left in the direction of the land of Canaan to see if his luck would improve. The Torah shows us that Abraham was so important in the eyes of the other members of his father's household that they all joined in the migration in order to stay close to him.

It can either mean that Terach lived longer than the years originally allocated to him, or it can mean that he did not live all the years that had originally been allocated to him. Here the absence of the words \"<b>all</b> the days of his life\" most likely mean that he lived longer than the years originally allocated to him. He accumulated merit because of his extraordinary concern for the welfare of his son Abraham. One proof may be seen when we compare Terach's lifespan with that of his father Nachor. The latter had only lived for a total of 148 years (11,24-25). Terach lived 57 years longer than his father. Our sages (<i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 65,12) have said that when a man approaches to within 5 years (either side) of the age at which his parents died he should begin to be concerned about his own death approaching.

                    "Inasmuch as Terach lived many years longer than his father, the Torah reports his death in conjunction with his migration to Charan to indicate which merit added the extra years to his life. Had the Torah merely stated the usual \"<span class=\"font1\">ויהיו כל ימי תרח</span>, all the years of Terach were, etc., we would have assumed that G'd had originally allocated to him a lifespan of 205 years although this would have been quite wrong. There is also support from the text for the view that Terach lived fewer years than had been allocated to him originally. The Torah reports that he set out on his way to Canaan. However, the Torah also reports that he died in Charan which is on the way. Terach had failed to make good on his vow to move to Canaan and settled in Charan. G'd shortened Terach's lifespan because he did not make good on his vow.",
                    "I have had an inspiration which enables me to explain why Abraham left his father in Charan though the latter had migrated for his sake all the way from Ur Casdim. When Abraham moved to Canaan Terach was 143 years old. He was 68 years old when Abraham was born and Abraham was 75 when he moved to the land of Canaan. [I presume that verse 26 which describes Terach as 70 years old when his three sons were born must refer to his age when the youngest was born. Ed.] It seems difficult to understand that Abraham abandoned his father for so many (62) years, even though G'd had told him <span class=\"font1\">לך לך</span>.",
                    "I believe the answer is simply that Abraham had good reason to expect that his father would die soon after his departure for Canaan, seeing that he was within 5 years of the age at which his grandfather Nachor had died. G'd may even have given Abraham a subtle hint when He told him <span class=\"font1\">לך לך</span>, go on \"your acccount.\" The words \"on your account,\" were to indicate that even if Abraham's father were to live additional years he had only Abraham's merit to thank for those years.

                    "<b> <span class=\"font1\">ויאמר ה׳ אל אברם</span>, G'd said to Abram, etc.</b> There are two reasons for the most unusual phenomenon of G'd speaking to Abraham without having first appeared to him in some kind of vision. 1) Abraham's constant endeavour to get to know his Creator, something no one had ever done before him. According to our tradition Abraham already recognised his Creator at the age of five without having received any guidance from a teacher. G'd therefore did not have to prove His existence to Abraham by appearing to him in a vision. He could take it for granted that Abraham was aware of who was speaking to him.",
                    "2) During the ten generations since Noach that preceded Abraham not a single human being had recognised his G'd so that G'd had found him worthy to speak to. G'd therefore decided to test Abraham before speaking to him. He did this by demanding of Abraham that he leave his home, etc. Only after he had successfully passed that test did G'd decide to reveal Himself to Abraham in a vision as we find in 12,7. G'd did not relate in this manner to later generations because those generations had already absorbed a measure of faith in G'd through the example of their patriarch Abraham. They were born into an environment of some sanctity, an advantage not enjoyed by Abraham. As a result, G'd was able to commence His communications with such people by granting them a vision before He spoke to them. In Psalms 45,11 the Psalmist refers to Abraham's experience when he says: \"Take heed, lass, and note, incline your ear; forget your people and your father's house.\" Our sages declared that the first half of that verse <b><span class=\"font1\">שמעי</span>,</b> listen, applied to our patriarch Abraham, i.e. when G'd spoke to him in 12,1. The second half of the verse where the Psalmist speaks about <b><span class=\"font1\">דאי</span></b>, i.e. a visual experience, refers to 12,7 when G'd is reported to have appeared to Abraham in a vision. The sound and the vision did not occur simultaneously. To signify this the Psalmist did not say <span class=\"font1\">שמעי וראי בת</span>, but placed the word <span class=\"font1\">בת</span> in the middle. The best proof for the correctness of our view is the comparison with Moses' experience at the burning bush (Exodus 3,2-4) when a visual phenomenon preceded G'd speaking to him.",
                    "<b><span class=\"font1\">לך לך מארצך</span>. \"Go forth for yourself from your country.\"</b> Why did G'd tell Abraham to leave his birthplace after He had already told him to leave his country? Surely, leaving one's country includes leaving one's birthplace?",
                    "The Torah lists the departures according to the pain of leave-taking involved. It is less painful to leave one's country than to leave one's birthplace, and it is even more painful to leave one's family. Abraham is commanded to leave in an ascending order of the nostalgia involved. He complied with the most difficult part of the test by leaving his parental home. The manner in which the Torah describes the process indicates that Abraham received an additional reward for each stage. We have a similar description of the gradually increasing difficulty of complying with G'd's command when G'd told Abraham to take: \"your son, your only one, the one you love,\" as an introduction to the <span class=\"font1\">עקדה</span> in Genesis 21,2.",
                    "It is also possible that whereas Abraham's departure from Ur Casdim had included a migration of his whole family, now G'd demanded that he leave his family behind. Abraham did not understand this correctly; this is why he took Lot with him. Alternatively, Abraham did understand that he was not supposed to <b>take</b> Lot with him, but the latter was so attached to him that he insisted on coming along on his own. When the Torah says in 12,5 that he did \"take\" Lot with him, the meaning is merely that he did not push him away until he found a suitable pretext as he did not want to shame his nephew. As soon as Abraham found a minor pretext to separate from Lot, such as when the shepherds of Lot and those of Abraham began to feud, he used that incident as an excuse to separate from Lot (13,8). It sounds quite uncharacteristic for Abraham, the model of making people welcome in his environment, to push someone away with both hands by saying: \"if you want to go to the right, I will move to the left; if you want to move to the left, I will move to the right.\" The fact that G'd had not communicated with Abraham for a while until immediately after he separated from Lot (13,14), indicates that G'd had been waiting for the moment when Lot would finally separate from him. Only then did G'd show Abraham the extent of the land that would eventually belong to his descendants. G'd delayed fulfilling the last part of the promise contained in our verse until Abraham had rid himself of Lot.",
                    "An additional meaning of the instruction to Abraham to \"go for yourself,\" is not so much that he was to be alone but that he was to benefit spiritually by this migration. Although man's success in this world does not depend on the amount of effort he invests in his material progress as we know from Psalms 75,7: \"for what lifts a man comes not from the east or the west or the wilderness of hills;\" our sages say that every time the word <b><span class=\"font1\">הרים</span>,</b> mountains appears in the Bible it means mountains except in this instance. In Psalms 75,7 the word describes a spiritual uplift. This comment of our sages notwithstanding, the fact that a change of one's physical environment brings in its wake an improvement in one's fortune is not to be ignored. This was why G'd commanded Abraham specifically to leave <b>his country.</b> Our sages (<i>Chulin</i> 95) say that there are three things, which do not actually constitute forbidden superstition even if one does pay attention to them. However, such attention borders on superstition. They are: <span class=\"font1\">בית, תינוק, ואשה</span>. [If the enterprise one undertakes after building himself a house, after a baby is born to one, or after one has married, turns out well, it may be taken as a good omen. If not, it may be a sign that one should not persevere with that particular endeavour. Rabbi Eleazar adds that one should not be influenced by such failure unless it occurred three times in succession. Ed.] <i>Baba Metzia</i> 75 also said that if one experiences bad luck in one place without moving to another place one has oneself to blame if one's fortunes do not improve.",

                    "<b><span class=\"font1\">אל הארץ אשר אראך</span>, to the land which I will show you.</b> G'd did not tell Abraham if he was meant to set out on his journey immediately or if he should wait till He would specify the exact location He wanted Abraham to move to. This ambiguity was part of the test to which G'd subjected Abraham. G'd also hinted that He would show Abraham the whole of the land of Israel by broadening his field of vision, etc, as we know from 13,14: \"lift your eyes from where you are and look northward, southward, eastward, and westward.\"",
                    "G'd also hinted that Abraham should move to <span class=\"font1\">ארץ ישראל</span>, a land suitable for the Presence of G'd to become manifest, and for people who are worthy to experience such a manifestation. The <i>Sifri</i> on Numbers 35,34 states that (full) manifestation of G'd's presence depends on the Jewish people being in the land of Israel. Accordingly, the meaning of the word <span class=\"font1\">אראך</span> is both: \"I will show <b>it</b> (the land) to you,\" and: \"I will show <b>you</b> to it (the land).\" One will not achieve its full potential without the other."

These three promises were compensations for things people normally enjoy when they are in familiar surroundings. 1) They have many friends and acquaintances. 2) They enjoy a degree of honour and respect within their family. 3) Inasmuch as they are part of a family their economic needs are taken care of should they fall on hard times.

After all, G'd did not even tell Abraham which country to head for! It was a tremendous test for Abraham to just leave his home, etc., without having the slightest idea where he was to make his new home. The fact that Abraham did not query G'd in his mind or by prayer is considered as extremely praiseworthy. As a result of this blind faith in G'd, Abraham encountered success wherever he went. His spiritual stature grew constantly.",
                    "We are entitled to ask why the wording of the Torah is different in respect to those who bless Abraham from that to those who curse him. In the former case G'd mentions that <b>He will bless</b> such people even before they have actually blessed Abraham. In the case of people who curse Abraham, G'd is not described as cursing such people until <b>after</b> they have actually cursed him. If G'd were to curse the potential curser prior to his cursing Abraham, that person would never become aware of the reason G'd cursed him. On the other hand, G'd does not cause any harm by blessing those who intended to bless Abraham already in anticipation of their good deed.",
                    "It is also noteworthy that the Torah speaks about the people who will bless Abraham in the plural, whereas the reference to anyone who might curse Abraham is phrased in the singular.",
                    "Perhaps this is best explained in connection with what the rabbis said to the son of Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai in <i>Moed Katan</i> 9. They wished him: <span class=\"font1\">תזרע ולא תחצד</span>, \"may you sow and not harvest,\" and a few more such strange sounding wishes. The Talmud describes how Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai explained to his son that though these wishes sounded like curses they were actually blessings. The reference to sowing and not harvesting was a blessing i.e. that he should father children but not have to bury them. It is not the actual phraseology that matters but the intent. G'd told Abraham that there are some people who clothe their curses in words that sound like blessings. He told him that He would also bless the individual who blessed Abraham in such an unusual manner as did the rabbis who blessed the son of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. The word <span class=\"font1\">מקללך</span> applies both to what preceded it and to what follows it. Accordingly there are two kinds of people who might curse Abraham; the ones who dress up the curse to sound like a blessing, and the ones who curse outright. The first category is alluded to when you read the word <span class=\"font1\">ומקללך</span> as if it belonged to the word <span class=\"font1\">מברכיך</span> which preceded it. The other kind of curser is the one who curses without provocation and without hypocrisy. When the Torah says of G'd <span class=\"font1\">אאר</span>, this refers to both categories of people cursing Abraham.",
                    "An alternate way of explaining this is based on the statement in <i>Taanit</i> 20: \"better the curse of an Achiyah Hashiloni (a prophet, compare Kings I 14,15) than the blessing conferred upon the Jewish people by Bileam.\" The former used words of a curse to give the Jewish people an incentive to overcome the curse, the latter praised them excessively, hoping to lull them into a kind of spiritual nirvana that would make them easy prey for the evil urge. Concerning the person who bestows the kind of Achiyah Hashiloni's curse on Abraham, G'd says that He will bless a person who curses with such good intentions, whereas concerning the one who does the reverse, G'd will curse him though he couched his curse in words which seemed to convey a blessing.",

The letter <span class=\"font1\">כ</span> at the beginning of the word <span class=\"font1\">כאשר</span>, describes the time, i.e. how Abraham acted immediately G'd finished speaking to him, how he left his father and his birthplace without further ado. The Torah adds that though Lot was so closely attached to Abraham that he insisted on accompanying Abraham, he did not do so for the same reason, i.e. a divine command. Abraham had tried to leave Lot behind in an elegant way but had not succeeded.

Inasmuch as G'd had promised Abraham a number of rewards if he would fulfil His command, the average reader might assume that Abraham was primarily motivated by the promises G'd had made to him. The Torah wants us to know that the reason Abraham left his home and his father was because <b>G'd had said so to him,</b> not because of any secondary considerations such as the promise of becoming a man of great prominence. The Torah chose the words <span class=\"font1\">כאשר <b>דבר</b></span>, as G'd had told him <b>firmly,</b> not <span class=\"font1\">כאשר <b>אמר</b></span>, which would have corresponded to the opening statement of our <span class=\"font1\">פרשה</span> where it said: <span class=\"font1\"><b>ויאמר</b> השם</span>. When G'd uses the word <span class=\"font1\">דבר</span>, this always implies that it is not easy to comply with G'd's command; when G'd uses the word <span class=\"font1\">אמר</span> the implication is that it is relatively easy to comply.",

The reason that the Torah mentions the presence of the Caaanite in the land only in this verse, and not in verse 5 where we would have expected it, is to indicate exactly when the land of Israel passed into the hands of the Canaanites (having previously belonged to the descendants of Shem). The fact that the expression <span class=\"font1\">ארצה כנען</span> is used already in verse 5 means only that the Torah refers to the name the country would be known by subsequently.",

The Canaanite taking over the land from the Semites eventually opened the way for the Israelites to dispossess, them. The Semites, who had come by the land legally, would have presented G'd with a legal problem He had to solve before He could have disposessed them. Our sages have said that inasmuch as Abraham was a Semite, expelling the Canaanites and having the Israelites take over the land was only a return of the land to its rightful owners. Accordingly, the Torah phrases its description of the Canaanite presence in the land in such a way that the world understands that such a presence was never legal (compare Rashi and <i>Nedarim</i> 32).",

Abraham considered the mere fact that G'd appeared to him as sufficient reason to build an altar for G'd. The feeling that G'd had deemed him worthy to appear to him was so overpowering that Abraham considered the promise of children and of the land as secondary. This is why the Torah stresses that he built the altar \"to the G'd who appeared to him.\" This is what David said in Psalms 16,11: \"In Your presence is perfect joy.\" Perhaps we find an echo of these sentiments when Ben Azzai declined to marry, saying that he was so in love with Torah that he could not do justice to the demands made upon him by marriage ( <i>Yevamot</i> 63)."

We need to understand why Abraham spoke to Sarah about her beauty. ",
                    "If it was merely because he planned to have her describe him as her brother instead of as her husband, this would not diminish the danger they found themselves in. Sarah would be in danger of being killed if she resisted rape, or else would have to submit voluntarily to someone who fancied her. Abraham wanted to forestall Sarah's argument that he should never have brought her to Egypt in the first place and have endangered them both. While it is true that righteous people have to place their trust in G'd, this rule applies when one does not deliberately place oneself in a dangerous situation. No one has the right to make his survival depend on a miracle. We know this from the prophet Samuel who took along an animal to sacrifice when he set out to anoint David as king. He did this even though G'd Himself told him to go on that mission. When he remonstrated with G'd that the mission could be fatal for him if Saul would hear about it, G'd Himself told Samuel to camouflage it (Samuel I 16,1-5). Abraham therefore told Sarah that had he but known earlier how beautiful she was he would indeed not have undertaken such a dangerous journey. He would have taken her elsewhere. Now that they had already come close to Egypt he had found out more about the Egyptians' lack of sexual mores and the fact that they had ugly faces (or were black-skinned). He therefore had reason to fear for his life if he were to be known as Sarah's husband. He examined Sarah's beauty critically in order to understand the degree of danger that this could pose for him. Abraham did not describe Sarah as merely <span class=\"font1\">יפת מראה</span>; he described her as <span class=\"font1\">אשה יפת מראה</span>. There is a subtle difference here. He realised that her beauty was unique. Her beauty was bound to arouse the carnal instincts of the Egyptians. ",

Whereas the Egyptians had ugly faces, this did not apply to the Philistines. Sarah's beauty therefore did not represent such a contrast to what the Philistines were used to. This is why Abraham never ordered Sarah herself to say that he was her brother. He contented himself with describing Sarah as his sister (20,2)."

He wanted her to make it plain even before they entered the land of Egypt that they were travelling together as brother and sister. In the event that Sarah would object to telling lies when none had as yet been called for, he told her that if they merely awaited developments it would be too late. The Egyptians would automatically assume that Abraham was Sarah's husband and they would get rid of him. They would not even bother to ask about her status."

In order that I will receive benefit on your account.</b> Abraham explained why he asked Sarah to describe him as her brother and not as some more distant relative or a total stranger. If Abraham's status were anything less than Sarah's brother the Egyptians would not have any interest in securing his goodwill. Abraham may have had yet another motivation for insisting that Sarah describe their relationship to each other instead of he himself. His own words would not convince the Egyptians as they might construe them as a stratagem to be wooed with gifts. The plain reason is no doubt that he was afraid that if he were to say he was her brother and she would say nothing, sooner or later Sarah might make a comment which would reveal that there was a husband-wife relationship between her and Abraham. When Abraham added that <span class=\"font1\">וחיתה <b>נפשי</b></span>, that his soul would remain alive due to the stratagem of Sarah describing him as her brother, he did not have in mind his mere physical survival. If that had been his intention he would have said <span class=\"font1\">ואחיה</span>, \"so that I will survive.\" The word <span class=\"font1\">וחיתה נפשי</span> is an allusion to <b>Sarah's</b> remaining spiritually uncontaminated. We have a tradition (Proverbs 13,25) that <span class=\"font1\">צדיק אוכל לשובע נפשו</span>, that the reason a righteous person consumes physical food is not to indulge his senses but to satisfy the needs of his soul to carry on his task in life. Abraham was motivated by similar considerations.",
                    "The reason Abraham appears to repeat himself when he said 1) <span class=\"font1\">בעבורך</span>, and 2) <span class=\"font1\">בגללך</span>, is that he hoped he would exprience physical wellbeing as well as spiritual wellbeing due to Sarah's describing herself as his sister. Our sages (<i>Berachot</i> 31) explain Samuel I 1,11 <span class=\"font1\">אם ראה תראה בעני אמתך</span>, to mean that if <span class=\"font1\">ראה</span>, G'd would see Channah (pay attention to her prayer) and would grant her a child, all well and good; if not <span class=\"font1\">תראה</span>, she would place herself in a compromising situation which would force her husband to treat her as a <span class=\"font1\">סוטה</span>, a woman suspected of marital infidelity. Once she would drink the waters prescribed for such a woman (Numbers 5,24) her innocence would be established and G'd <b>would have to</b> grant her a child as per verse 28 in that chapter. Abraham hoped that as a result of Sarah's chastity under circumstances resembling the compromising situation a <span class=\"font1\">סוטה</span> finds herself in, he and she would have a child thus assuring Abraham of his future, <span class=\"font1\">וחיתה נפשי</span>, \"my soul will live on.\" There are numerous instances where our sages have explained the word <span class=\"font1\">בגלל</span> as having metaphysical significance, such as in Deuteronomy 15,10 where G'd promises that blessings will devolve upon people already if they merely promise to do charity, <span class=\"font1\">דבר</span> (<i>Tossephta Peah</i> 4). The letter <span class=\"font1\">ו</span> in <span class=\"font1\">וחיתה</span> also has a special significance. Abraham did not mean that the fact that his soul would remain alive would be part of the benefit he would experience through Sarah's lie. Whereas the survival of his body would be an extension of <span class=\"font1\">ייטב לי</span>, the direct benefit he would derive from Sarah's lie, the spiritual dimension, i.e. the survival of his soul would be an independent benefit, something that he would achieve later on when Sarah would be alone in the palace of Avimelech, the king of the Philistines. On that occasion he did not face expulsion from the land of the Philistines on account of having been found out as a liar (20,15). It is even possible that the fact that Sarah twice found herself in the position of a <span class=\"font1\">סוטה</span>, a woman unjustly suspected of marital infidelity, once in the palace of Pharaoh, and then again in the palace of Avimelech, resulted in her ability to conceive and bear a child. Rabbi Yitzchok, (a teacher of Rashi?) suggests that when the Torah appears to repeat itself in Numbers 5,28, i.e. \"if the woman has not become defiled and has remained pure,\" this refers to her neither having been unfaithful with the man with whom she is suspected to have been unfaithful now, nor with any other man. In such a case she will be unharmed by the waters she has drunk and able to retain seed. Accordingly, Sarah became pregnant and bore Isaac to prove that she had been faithful to her husband each time she found herself in the situation of a <span class=\"font1\">סוטה</span>. The expression <span class=\"font1\">חיתה נפשי</span> would refer to Abraham having children due to the chaste conduct of Sarah."

                    "One reason why Pharaoh and Avimelech reacted differently to Abraham's deception may have to do with the ugliness of the Egyptians. Pharaoh expelled Abraham (12,20), whereas Avimelech put the whole country at his disposal (20,15). Pharaoh could not be sure that some other member of his people would not rape Sarah even after he had released her since Sarah's beauty was in such contrast to that of his own people and his people were steeped in sexual permissiveness. Avimelech had no such concerns. This is why he asked Abraham: \"what did you see, etc?\" He meant \"why did you have reason to be worried?\" Pharaoh understood very well that Abraham would never feel safe once the people knew Sarah was his wife. He had to be given safe conduct out of the country. The Torah tells us of the hypocrisy of Pharaoh by adding his second question. Pharaoh was entitled to the first question. He could claim that Abraham should have told him at least privately that Sarah was his wife. He claimed to have been insulted by Abraham's lie since he would have provided Abraham with security once he knew that he was Sarah's husband. Abraham had made it plain by his lie that he even suspected Pharaoh himself of being unable to restrain his lust. He wanted Abraham to believe that either a) he would have provided him with a security escort, or b) he would have sent him out of the country immediately. We might well ask why every husband who comes to a foreign country has to identify his entourage and point out to the king who is his wife. ",
                    "Pharaoh asked why Abraham told a lie though normally there had not been a need for him to say anything regarding this woman. Nonetheless Sarah's extraordinary beauty should have prompted him to come forward and tell the truth in order to ensure his and her safety. The moment Abraham misrepresented the facts, he only had himself to blame if Pharaoh decided to take Sarah for himself. Abraham could not answer Pharaoh without insulting him further by telling him that he placed no trust in his assurances, that he thought Pharaoh perfectly capable of doing what he did even had he known that Sarah was married to him. Pharaoh may well have got the hint; this may be why he hastened to expel Abraham and entourage from Egypt."

After all, he respected his uncle too highly as the senior member of the family. The substance of the shepherds' arguments concerned the fact that Lot allowed his shepherds to graze on privately owned land, counting on G'd's promise that the land would belong to Abraham's family in the future. Seeing that Abraham had no children and was genetically unable to father children, Lot viewed himself as Abraham's heir. Abraham alluded to this by the superfluous comment that they were brothers.",

He could not allow this to happen.",

Ed.] Rabbi Eliezer, basing himself on our verse, claims that merely traversing the land assures one of one's rights to the area one has traversed; the other rabbis hold that one has to go through the regular legal procedure for acquiring title. The rabbis say that our verse is not to be taken as a general rule, but that an exception was made in the case of Abraham who was especially beloved of G'd. G'd intended to facilitate Abraham's descendants taking possession of the land when the time came. According to these rabbis, Abraham's title to the land stems from verse 15 where G'd had promised it to Abraham. The reason G'd rolled the land up so as to bring it close to Abraham was in order that the act of moving it would demonstrate ownership by the person on whose behalf it was moved."

This did not deter them from taking Lot captive. The Torah stresses that these kings deliberately ignored the fact that they were provoking a man of international repute when they took his nephew into captivity. None of this would have happened to Lot had he not chosen to live in Sodom. The matter can be compared to Israel capturing a substantial part of Moab though G'd had forbidden Israel to provoke war with Moab or to attack it (Deut. 2,9). Once the Emorite king Sichon had defeated Moab in war, the lands captured by Sichon were no longer considered as Moabite territory, and Israel took possession of them. Here too, once Lot had chosen to throw in his lot with the Sodomites he was no longer considered as part of Abraham's entourage, and was not entitled to the protection Abraham could have afforded him. This also explains why Abraham did not try to secure Lot's release by peaceful means. He knew that the 4 kings knew very well whom they had taken prisoner. If Lot's relationship with Abraham had not stopped them, there was no point for Abraham to warn those kings before attacking them. Lot's capture was a hostile act against Abraham. ",
                    "Should you argue that the four kings had merely reacted against the insubordination of the five kings associated with the king of Sodom, and that Lot was their legitimate booty, as per the comparison we have drawn with Sichon and the Moabites, this is not an accurate comparison after all. That comparison was valid when there existed neither a state of peace nor a state of war between two parties. Abraham and the four kings were at peace, and the four kings should have warned Lot to leave Sodom before making war just as did King Saul with the Kenites before he attacked the Amalekites (Samuel I 15,6)."

The reason that the Torah interrupts the report of Lot's rescue by reporting Malki Tzedek's arrival is to contrast his behaviour with that of the king of Sodom. Whereas Malki Tzedek came with gifts and a blessing though Abraham had done nothing for him, the king of Sodom came empty-handed although he owed Abraham a great debt of gratitude for having saved both his life and his kingdom.

In view of Abraham's personal piety the king of Sodom was well aware that he would not eat food or drink wine presented to him by an idolator.

He himself had captured it, including all the people who had been kept prisoner. How could the king say on the one hand: \"<b>give me the persons</b>,\" and \"take yourself the loot,\" when Abraham possessed both at the time? What did the king offer? Was he not in fact merely <b>asking for something</b> instead of offering something? Why did he make it seem like a trade off?",
                    "Perhaps we can best understand all this in light of what the Talmud teaches in <i>Baba Kama</i> 116. A caravan of travellers is attacked by robbers. One of the travellers succeeds in saving the belongings of all the travellers; he is considered as having done so on behalf of all the travellers; each one picks up his original belongings. If the person who undertook the risk of saving all these belongings had declared that he risked his life only in order that the spoils should be his in the event that he would succeed, then he may keep all the chattels he has saved. Rav Ashi elaborates that this is so when the other travellers could have saved their chattels had they only tried hard enough. Rashi explains there that if none of the other travellers offered any comment when the one who set out to recover the goods announced that he would do so but on his own account, they are all considered as having renounced their hope of recovering their belongings. As a result they cannot reclaim their belongings. The king of Sodom did not consider himself as having abandoned hope of escaping his situation. He argued that had it not been for Abraham's intervention, he could have recovered his belongings himself. ",

After all, the king of Sodom had not overheard Abraham's declaration that he acted on his own behalf. How could he therefore be accused of having remained silent at the crucial moment? This is why he claimed that the spoils should be shared between Abraham and himself. Evidently, the king thought very highly of himself and his abilities. This is why the Torah describes him as: <span class=\"font1\">ויצא מלך סדום</span>, \"the king of Sodom came forth,\" he gave himself airs. According to the <i>Midrash</i> he compared his own experience when he fell into the clay pits (14,10) and was saved, with Abraham's having been saved from the furnace of Nimrod. The fact was, of course, that the situation of the king of Sodom who had already fought and lost, was entirely diferent from the situation described in the Talmud by Rav Ashi. When Rav Ashi said that the person rescuing the caravan's property has to declare beforehand that he does so on the understanding that if successful the property will be his, this is only in a situation where the other travellers are able to assist. Since the king of Sodom had certainly not been in a position to assist Abraham, his claim was totally spurious. Rambam and Rosh both rule like this. ",

When Abraham stressed the <span class=\"font1\"><b>לי</b></span> aspect of his future descendants, he referred to the fact that G'd had not promised him children or grandchildren of any stature. This is why G'd told him \"to count the stars.\" The stars were meant to be symbols. G'd wanted Abraham to know that his descendants would all be important in their own right. They would be righteous people who could overcome the stars, i.e. their fates would not be subject to zodiac constellations, to <span class=\"font1\">מזל</span>. <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 69,5 explains the simile of the \"dust of the earth\" to mean that just as dust cannot prosper without water, so Jacob's (Abraham's) descendants would not prosper without Torah which is for the spirit what water if for the body. The <i>Midrash</i> there lists other qualities of dust which make it seem as something valuable and important. Examination of various <i>Midrashim</i> on the subject of <span class=\"font1\">עפר</span>, dust, shows that we never find dust treated as something valuable until after Abraham's descendants were compared to stars for the first time. This is the reason that the quotation from the <i>Midrash</i> we have cited was from <span class=\"font1\">פרשת ויצא</span> and not from here.

He referred to his trusted disciple Eliezer. Such a one would be more suited than an unworthy biological descendant. A typical example would be a grandson such as Esau.",

The Talmud (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 6) says that when one makes a promise to give charity to a sacred cause it is considered as binding or as effective as if one had already actually <b>handed over</b> the object of a vow to an ordinary person. Abraham qualified for a reward by merely expressing his belief in G'd's promise. You may well ask what practical benefit Abraham received by this reward seeing that neither Ishmael nor Isaac had been born as yet?

The Torah therefore gives Abraham credit for not worrying how G'd could guarantee his children would be worthy. Another way of looking at Abraham's act of faith is based on the tradition (<i>Pessikta Zutra Lech Lecha</i> 15,5) that the world will not lack a minimum of 30 (or 36) righteous men by whose merit it continues to exist. This tradition is based on the numerical value of the word <span class=\"font1\">יהיה</span> in the previous verse.

Will Abraham's descendants experience all these stages of unpleasantness for the whole of the 400 years, or will some experience some of the afflictions and others only being strangers such as history has taught us?",
                    "I believe the Torah repeated the words <span class=\"font1\">ידע תדע</span> for three separate reasons. 1) Our sages said: \"our forefathers descended to Egypt on account of a relatively minor sin, i.e. Abraham having asked: 'How will I know that I will inherit'\" (Genesis 15,8)? G'd answered him; <span class=\"font1\">ידוע</span>, \"know! that because you asked, <span class=\"font1\">תדע</span> you should be aware that your descendants will first be strangers, etc.\" 2) Seeing that G'd's response to Abraham's question contained both a pleasant and an unpleasent message, i.e. enslavement and subsequent redemption, G'd told Abraham that just as surely as there would first be enslavement, this would be followed by redemption. 3) Our sages (<i>Berachot</i> 18) commented on Deut. 34,4: <span class=\"font1\">זאת הארץ אשר נשבעתי לאברהם, ליצחק וליעקב <b>לאמד</b> לזרעך אתננה</span>, that G'd told Moses <b><span class=\"font1\">לאמר</span>, to tell</b> the patriarchs that He had fulfilled the oath He had sworn to all of them regarding the land of Israel. In view of this the repeated use of the expression <span class=\"font1\">ידע תדע</span> refers to both the present and the eventual status of that land.",
                    "The reason that the word <span class=\"font1\">גר</span> is stressed by being placed ahead of what is going to happen, is to inform us that the status of being an alien commenced already at this time. Abraham's life <b>from here on in</b> was part of the decree. Abraham should not think that his descendants' history would parallel his own experience to the extent that they would be aliens only part of these 400 years. Abraham was not to misunderstand the meaning of the words <span class=\"font1\">כי גר יהיה זרעך</span> as applying only at some time in the future. That period would commence the day he would have descendants, i.e. with the birth of Isaac. This was also a pleasant aspect of the decree in that all the years Isaac and Jacob lived either in the land of Canaan or at Laban's were counted as part of the 400 years.",
                    "Should you argue that this could have been expressed equally well by use of the normal syntax <span class=\"font1\">כי זרעך גר יהיה</span>, know that G'd wisely phrased it differently in order to reveal that He had not decreed slavery and oppression for all of Abraham's descendants. G'd wanted that Abraham should have the satisfaction of knowing that some of his descendants would only have to suffer being aliens, nothing worse. It is as if G'd had said to Abraham: \"you will have a share in your descendants,\" i.e. they will only suffer being strangers without suffering anything worse. Had G'd used the word <span class=\"font1\">זרעך</span> first, this would have created the wrong impression. By inserting the word <span class=\"font1\">יהיה</span> between the words <span class=\"font1\">גר</span> and <span class=\"font1\">זרעך</span> the Torah makes clear that some of Abraham's descendants would experience only <span class=\"font1\">גרות</span>. The descendants referred to were Isaac, Jacob, and all of Jacob's sons. As a result what sounded like 400 years of enslavement and oppression actually was reduced to 210 years, the years remaining before the Exodus after the last of Joseph's brothers had died. Even the tribe of Levi who, according to our sages never performed slave labour, did not completely escape the aspects of enslavement and oppression seeing that its babies too were subject to drowning. Moses' own experience when his basket stood in the bulrushes at the banks of the Nile, is the best proof for the anxieties suffered by even the most prominent families of the Levites."

                    "<b> <span class=\"font1\">וגם את הגוי אשר יעבודו דן אנכי</span>, \"I will also judge the nation for whom they perform slave labour.\"</b> What justification is there for the word \"also\" in this verse? The last subject the Torah spoke about was enslavement and oppression. How can the retribution be linked to the former by the word <span class=\"font1\">וגם</span>, \"and also?\" Besides, as we are all aware that G'd is the judge, why does G'd have to say <span class=\"font1\">דן <b>אנכי</b></span>, \"I will judge?\" Who else could possibly judge? Why does the Torah write <span class=\"font1\">את הגוי</span> instead of merely <span class=\"font1\">הגוי</span>, \"the nation?\" Why does the Torah not mention the conclusion of the Jewish people's exile experience at the end of verse 13 by adding: \"after that they will depart with great possessions,\" and then add the part about G'd's retribution to the Egyptians in verse 14? Why was the part about the retribution inserted in the middle of the sequence? The last question is probably best answered by recalling that events actually happened in precisely the order the Torah describes. First the Jews were enslaved and oppressed, then G'd smote the Egyptians with the ten plagues; finally the Jews left Egypt having \"borrowed\" all of the Egyptians' gold and silver.",
                    "An equally valid explanation of the sequence of the verse will become clear when we keep in mind what our sages had to say on Exodus 13,18. We read there that <span class=\"font1\">וחמושים עלו בני ישראל מארץ מצרים</span>. According to the <i>Mechilta</i> the meaning is that only one out of five Israelites left Egypt, the remainder having died in Egypt during the plague of darkness so as not to afford the Egyptians the satisfaction to observe that they had not been worthy of redemption. The judgments that verse 14 speaks about then would be G'd judging the Israelites who did not merit to participate in the Exodus. The verse also alludes to the opportunity the Israelites had to examine where the Egyptians kept their valuables during the days of darkness, and to subsequently demand to borrow those. The expression <span class=\"font1\">וגם</span> is used to demonstrate that G'd kept the promise made to Abraham here. This was recorded in Exodus 12,35-36. The word <span class=\"font1\">וגם</span> means that G'd referred to something in addition to the decree of enslavement, namely that the redemption would be accompanied by a windfall of silver and gold, a compensation for some of the suffering to be endured. The word <span class=\"font1\">את</span> refers to the death of 80% of the Israelites, whereas the word <span class=\"font1\">אנכי</span> refers to the fact that this was something only G'd himself would know about; the Egyptians would not have any idea that some Jews died during the plague of darkness. ",
                    "The question arises why G'd punished the Egyptians altogether when they had actually carried out the decree G'd had announced long previously.",
                    "Maimonides already answered this in his <span class=\"font1\">ספר המדע</span>, explaining that G'd had never appointed a specific nation to carry out His decree. Whenever Gentile nations abuse Jews and this appears to be a fulfilment of a divine decree, none of the Gentiles had ever been specifically charged to be G'd's agents in the matter. Nachmanides and Rabbi Avraham ben David both take issue with Maimonides on this. They feel that inasmuch as those Gentiles had carried out G'd's wishes they had actually performed a <span class=\"font1\">מצוה</span>. Nachmanides explains that the reason that G'd punished those nations was that they carried out the commandment with excessive enthusiasm. They demonstrated that they were intent on inflicting maximum discomfort on the Jews rather than to carry out G'd's will by what they did. When we keep this in mind, the word <span class=\"font1\">וגם</span> refers to the excessive zeal displayed by the nations who persecute us which is the reason that G'd judges them. The word <span class=\"font1\">את</span> then means that while G'd is busy punishing the Gentiles, He punishes the Jews who deserve it at one and the same time.",
                    "The Gentile nations persecute us because we separated ourselves from them by rejecting their religion. Had the Jewish people worshiped the lamb (Egyptian deity) in Egypt, the chances are the Egyptians would not have seen in us a foreign element and they would not have persecuted us. The same holds true throughout our history. Our persecution by the nations (at least from their point of view) has always been due to our refusal to accept their religious yardsticks, and to our describing ourselves as G'd's chosen people. The Gentile nations never viewed themselves as performing G'd's decree to punish us for our sins. There is therefore no question that they deserve retribution for what they did to us on their own initiative. G'd decreed that we be punished because we <b>did not observe all</b> of His commandments, whereas they persecuted us for <b>not disregarding all</b> of His commandments. This is what the prophet Zecharyah 1,15 had in mind when he quoted G'd as saying: <span class=\"font1\">אני קצפתי מעט והמה עזרו לרעה</span>, \"I was angry a little (because of a few sins Israel committed), and they overdid the punishment.\" In fact the Gentile nations contributed to our transgressing more of G'd's commandments because they maltreated us so much. ",
                    "G'd goes on record here that He knows the true motivations of our oppressors and that is why He will punish the Egyptians. The Torah continues by linking Israel's redemption to the degree of abuse they would experience at the hands of the Egyptians by saying: <span class=\"font1\">ואחרי כן יצאו</span>, \"and as a result of this (exaggerated maltreatment) they will depart with great belongings;\" Israel's redemption would be due in large measure to the excessive cruelty of its oppressors rather than to its accumulated merits. <i>Sanhedrin</i> 104 tells about the delegation the Egyptians sent to Alexander the Great demanding that the Jews return the silver and gold they had taken with them from Egypt at the time of the Exodus. Israel's representative countered by demanding back-pay with interest for several hundred years of slave labour by over a half a million of its people for over 200 years.",
                    "Our verse also contains a hint that when the Israelites went down to Egypt G'd's presence accompanied them (<i>Megillah</i> 29). Psalms 91,15: \"I will be with him (Israel) in distress,\" is also proof that the <span class=\"font1\">שכינה</span> accompanies the Jewish people into exile. Another indication that our verse speaks about the enslavement of the Israelites in Egypt is Exodus 24,10 where the nobles of Israel had a vision of a sapphire brick underneath the throne of G'd. This is an allusion to G'd having been present when the Israelites were engaged in brick-making in Egypt."

Why did the Torah interrupt the promises made to Abraham's descendants with a promise to Abraham personally? Even though G'd wanted to reassure Abraham that he personally would not experience the part of the decree connected with enslavement and oppression, this could have been stated after G'd had concluded telling him which generation would experience the redemption! The meaning would have been clear since the promise was adjoining the promise that Israel would experience redemption! Besides, why did the Torah have to repeat itself, stressing: a) \"in peace,\" and b) \"in a ripe old age?\" Would it not have sufficed to promise Abraham that he would die in a ripe old age before the enslavement of his descendants would commence? The promise of death in a ripe old age would have implied that Ishmael would become a penitent, as pointed out by <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 38,12.",
                    "Righteous people, and especially our patriarchs, were always concerned with losing part of the reward they had stored up for use in the Hereafter through some act of kindness G'd would perform for them in this world. According to <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 44,4 Abraham worried that he might have caused the death of an innocent person in his war against the four kings and that as a result he had forfeited some of his eternal reward. G'd therefore reassured him by saying in 15,1: \"Do not worry, your reward will be great.\" In view of the concern that Abraham displayed then it is reasonable to assume that he was similarly worried whether the eventual redemption from Egypt would not use up too many merits if it were accompanied by extraneous perks such as the <span class=\"font1\">רכוש גדול</span>, acquisition of material wealth that would accompany it. What troubled Abraham was that clearly G'd would have to perform miracles in order to free his enslaved descendants when the time came. G'd wanted to put his mind at rest immediately; this is why He interrupted the prediction of what was going to happen by promising Abraham that his peace of mind would not be disturbed. The promise of <span class=\"font1\">שלום</span>, refers to Abraham's peace of mind in the Hereafter, whereas the <span class=\"font1\">שיבה טובה</span>, ripe old age, refers to his concerns about life on earth."

                    "<b> <span class=\"font1\">ודור רביעי ישובו הנה</span>, \"And the fourth generation will return here, etc.\"</b> We must examine why the extent of the sins of the Emorite has a bearing on the timing of Israel's return to its homeland. Rashi and Nachmanides disagree on what the words \"the fourth generation\" refer to. Rashi understands them as a reference to the fourth generation from Yehudah (who descended to Egypt). His son was Peretz, his grandson was Chetzron; great grandson Caleb returned to the land of Israel. Nachmanides rejects Rashi's explanation preferring to understand the words as referring to a fourth generation of Emorites. He bases himself on G'd waiting up to four generations before visiting the sins of the fathers on their descendants (Exodus 34,7). Even if we accept the words of Nachmanides, why did G'd mention this fact to Abraham? Besides, it appears that no provision was made for the possible penitence of the Emorite, which, according to Nachmanides, would have delayed a return of the Jewish people to their homeland still further? Furthermore, assuming that Nachmanides is correct, why did G'd mention the sin of the Emorite altogether once He had told Abraham that the Jewish people would return to their homeland in the fourth generation?",
                    "Actually, G'd told Abraham of two possible timetables according to which the return of his descendants to the land of Canaan could occur. One is the end of the exile in Egypt and the oppression there. This would occur when the combination of the years of being a stranger, being enslaved, and finally being oppressed (<span class=\"font1\">עינוי</span>), would total 400 years. At that point G'd's decree would have been completed and He could lead the Jewish people forth from Egypt on the very day that those years came to an end. The second time factor which would enable the Jewish people to return to their homeland would be determined by the measure of guilt the Emorites had accumulated by that time. This would occur in the fourth generation, a generation later than the Exodus. For the purpose of this calculation the generation of Caleb is considered the third generation inasmuch as Caleb left Egypt as an adult. Even though Caleb personally entered the Holy Land (Numbers 14,30), the entry of a single Jew certainly does not constitute the return of a people to their homeland. When the Torah speaks about a generation it refers to the majority of the members of that generation. Caleb's sons constituted part of the fourth generation, as did all those who had not attained the age of 20 prior to the Exodus. The four generations are not to be counted as commencing with Yehudah, as does Rashi. If we were to count in Rashi's fashion i.e. from the time G'd's decree became effective, there is no reason why Isaac himself should not be considered as a generation either, seeing that the 400 years commenced with his birth. If, on the other hand, we are to count the generations as commencing with the first Jew who descended to Egypt, the count should commence with Jacob. If we did this, Caleb himself would already be the fifth generation. It is clear then that the count was meant to commence with the period the Israelites experienced enslavement. <i>Shemot Rabbah</i> 1,5 states that as long as any of Joseph's brothers was alive none of the Israelites were enslaved. The calculation of the fourth generation the Torah speaks about here therefore commences with Yehudah's sons Peretz and Chetzron.",
                    "The fact that the Torah uses the plural when speaking about the return of the Jewish people is a hint that the Torah speaks about people who have been forcibly prevented from returning up until that time. They would return after four generations have been completed. The first generation of Israelites who were forcibly prevented from returning to the land of Canaan were the children of Joseph and his brothers.",
                    "We now need to understand why the guilt of the Emorite plays any role in all this when the Torah elsewhere told us in Numbers 14 that the sin of the spies and the generation who believed the ten spies was the cause that re-entry to the land of Israel was delayed by an additional generation. The 400 years G'd had decreed were completed at the time the Jewish people asked that the spies be sent out. Had they not done so, they would have entered the land of Israel at the end of the 400 years G'd speaks about in our <span class=\"font1\">פרשה</span>. This would have coincided with the 3rd generation of the Jews who had experienced servitude. The additional generation was due to the sin of the spies. Assuming this tragic delay had not occurred, how could G'd have squared entry of the Jewish people to the land of Canaan with the measure of guilt of the Emorites the Torah speaks about here?",
                    "We must understand the Torah in terms of how the Talmud <i>Berachot 7</i> explains Chabakuk 1,13: <span class=\"font1\">למה תביט בוגדים, תחריש בבלע רשע צדיק ממנו</span>, \"Why do You countenance treachery, and stand by idly when the one in the wrong devours the one in the right?\" The Talmud says that while it is possible that the wicked triumphs over someone relatively more righteous than he, he will never triumph over someone truly righteous. This means that the wicked are not totally devoid of merits, and we find on occasion that by using their merit they can overcome someone else who is generally more pious than they (while on this earth). The reason is that the wicked at that time can point at the imperfections of the person who thinks of himself as righteous. When the wicked is absolutely wicked however, it is not only permissible to destroy him but whichever righteous person does so first deserves credit. One need not be a totally righteous person in order to be entitled to wipe out such a wicked person.",
                    "At the time of the Exodus as well as at the time when they despatched the spies about 15 months later, the Israelites were on the level of perfectly righteous people. Although they had sinned during the episode of the golden calf, they had been punished for that sin and had regained their status as <span class=\"font1\">צדיקים גמורים</span>, as perfectly righteous people. The \"echo\" of that sin was not strong enough to deprive them of that title especially vis-a-vis the Emorites. In <i>Sanhedrin</i> 110 Rabbi Eliezer describes the people at that time as pious, quoting Psalms 50,5: \"bring in My devotees, who made a covenant with Me over sacrifice\" as his support. After the episode with the spies, Israel lost this status. From that moment on their moral superiority over the Emorites was marginal. As long as they had been considered <span class=\"font1\">חסידים</span> their merit was enough to overcome the Emorites immediately. If the Emorites had refused to vacate the land in order to allow Israel to return there, they could have easily overcome them in battle. Now they had to wait until the Emorites accumulated a further measure of sin before their own moral superiority would suffice to overcome the Emorites in their homeland. Proof of our contention is found in Numbers 14,44 when the Israelites had realised that they had sinned grievously in fearing the Canaanites, and volunteered to fight them. Moses warned them against such an enterprise. They insisted and were defeated. Had they been considered as righteous they certainly would not have been defeated. All of this is an elaboration of what the prophet Chabakuk spoke about.",
                    "The point is underscored by Moses in Deut. 9.5, where Moses credits Israel's conquest of the land of the Canaanites not to their piety but to the wickedness of the inhabitants of that land at that time. Moses meant that the measure of their sins had become full by that time. Moses told the Israelites at that time that though they were not totally righteous, their merit was sufficient to overcome the complete lack of it in their opponents. He emphasised this lack of righteousness by the Israelites three times! However, the Emorites had absolutely <b>no merits left</b> that they could have used to help them triumph against Israel's various moral shortcomings.",
                    "We now understand the need for mentioning the \"fourth generation\" in G'd's promise in our verse. G'd stated that the latest possible date for Israel taking over its inheritance would be at the end of four generations since the onset of slavery. By that time the Emorites would not have any merit left they could use to deny Israel their return to the land of their forefathers. This part of the prophecy would become relevant only if Israel did not maintain sufficient moral superiority over the Canaanites, if they did not qualify for the appellation <span class=\"font1\">צדיק גמור</span>."

If, on the other hand, she really targeted Hagar with her complaint, she did not seem to address the right target. After all, it was Sarah who had been slighted, her honour had been impugned not Avraham's.  Furthermore, we must understand Avraham's reply. He appeared to have accepted Sarah's complaint when he said: \"do what you will with Hagar!\" If Avraham had not felt that he had a share of guilt in what happened he should have denied wrongdoing and not simply told Sarah what she could do.",
                    "In order to understand what transpired we must refer to <i>Bereshit Rabbah 45,1</i> where it is explained that the status of the servant Hagar was one which obligated Avraham to look after her economic needs, whereas he was not entitled to sell her. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish explains there that in return for supplying Hagar's needs, Avraham was entitled to consume (use, or own) the produce of her hands. This meant that wile Hagar was a bodily slave of Sarah, the proceeds of her labour belonged to Avraham. There is an argument in <i>Ketuvot</i> 79 whether the children born by women of such status belong to the mistress or to the husband. Those who hold that the infant belongs to the mistress base themselves on the principle that only one generation of \"labour\" belongs to the husband; when such \"labours\" have produced dividends in the form of children or animals, they certainly do not belong to the husband of the woman owning the slave. We have also learned in the name of Rav Ashi in <i>Gittin 39</i> that when a male slave has married a free woman in the presence of his master, the master must free him. The Talmud explains that this is so when the master has arranged the marriage. The commentators there are at pains to explain that the master had presumably freed the male salve in question first, as it is unlikely that he would use force to marry somebody forbidden to him in Jewish law. The same ruling applies when the woman was the slave and the husband was a free man. In that case the master has to free the woman (first). Concerning this ruling the <i>Maharik</i> writes in <i>Yoreh Deah</i> item 246 in laws dealing with slaves, that if a master engages in sexual intercourse with his slave intending to marry her, this is equivalent to setting her free. If his intention was purely; carnal, however, this has no legal consequences, i.e. she is not freed. There is a disagreement between Rav Alfassi and Maimonides concerning the result of a master sleeping with his slave without declaring any intention either way. According to Rav Alfassi on <i>Yevamot</i> 82. such an encounter also brings in its wake the freeing of the slave, whereas Maimonides disagrees in chapter 9 of the laws about slaves. After having explained all this, we can now return to the issue at hand.",

There is every reason to believe that Abraham could not have been unaware of Hagar's conduct. Our verse need not be understood as if Sarah had only now brought this to her husband's attention. Our verse reflects Sarah's anger that her husband had not reacted sooner to the slights she experienced at the hands of Hagar. When Abraham slept with Hagar in order to establish a man-wife relationship, Hagar in effect had become a free woman legally, as we have demonstrated from the rulings quoted. When Hagar assumed haughty airs it was because she no longer viewed herself as a slave. Sarah blamed her husband for enabling Hagar to have attained the status of a free person. She did not express anger at Hagar, seeing that Hagar was correct in no longer viewing herself as subservient to Sarah.",
                    "Sarah now challenged Hagar's new found legal status. She did this by emphasising that it was <b>she</b> who had initiated the union between Hagar and Abraham, not Abraham. She had given Hagar to Abraham inasmuch as she could dispose of the activities of her slave Hagar. Why would the Torah repeat (\"<b>I</b> have given <b>my slave</b> to your bosom\") something we knew already, except to stress the conditions under which Hagar had been given to Abraham? According to what we have explained earlier Abraham had no claim to the fruit of Hagar's womb. Any child of Hagar's would belong to Sarah, her mistress. Hagar had never been Abraham's slave so that he could have freed her. Hagar could only have been freed if her mistress had not given her to Abraham as a slave, or even specifically as a wife and we would fall back on the argument that Abraham would not consort with a harlot and that therefore even if he had not promised freedom to Hagar it was implied by his sleeping with her. All of this would apply only if Hagar had at that time been Abraham's slave, not when she was Sarah's slave. Sarah claimed that she had been very careful at the time she suggested that Abraham sleep with Hagar. She said (verse 2): \"please sleep <b>with my slave</b>.\" She had given Abraham notice that Hagar would remain her slave also after he had slept with her. Had Sarah not had such an intention, she would simply have said to Abraham: \"sleep with Hagar!\"",

Did we not know that Abraham was Sarah's husband? They say the word is an exclusion, i.e. Sarah insisted that in spite of Hagar sleeping with Abraham, he would remain a husband only to her! These words make excellent sense in the context of our approach to the whole episode. The Torah had to add this word so that we would understand that Hagar's status as a slave did not change as a result of her sleeping with Abraham. Abraham could neither release Hagar to someone else nor even free her.",
                    "Hearing Sarah's words, Abraham concurred with her. This can be understood on two levels. 1) Abraham had never intended that Hagar's status should change as a result of the new arrangements; nonetheless he did not consider himself as a <span class=\"font1\">קדש</span>, male prostitute, when he slept with her. 2) Originally, Abraham thought that Hagar became free as a result of his sleeping with her as a legal arrangement. He had not paid attention to the finer nuances of Sarah's words when she offered, or pressed, Hagar on him as a sleeping partner. Had he understood Sarah correctly he might not have agreed to sleep with Hagar at all, worrying that his sleeping with her would stamp him as a <span class=\"font1\">קדש</span>, male prostitute. This may well be the reason why during the fourteen years that elapsed between the birth of Ishmael and that of Isaac we never hear that Abraham slept with Hagar again.",
                    "The simplest approach to the whole problem is, of course, that as the Torah had not been given as yet, the various halachic wrinkles we have discussed did not enter the picture. The fact that Abraham and Sarah already observed the Torah's commandments of their own free will did not mean that on occasion, and in order to help fulfil some prophecy, they would not transgress laws temporarily. [Did not Jacob marry two sisters during their lifetime? Ed.] Maimonides already stated in chapter nine of <i>Yesodey Torah in Sefer Hamada</i> that when a properly accredited prophet asks the Jews to violate one of the 613 commandments on a temporary basis that one should obey him. He cites the example of the prophet Elijah who rebuilt a private altar at a time when such altars were prohibited (Kings 1 18). Seeing that Sarah was a greater prophetess than he (<i>Shemot Rabbah</i> 1, based on Genesis 21,12), Abraham complied with her suggestion. It was necessary for matters to develop in this manner so that the residue of the original serpent's poison, some of which was still lodged within Abraham, could be expelled with the sperm which impregnated Hagar. When Abraham would eventually father Isaac, this would be from sperm that was no longer contaminated by the <span class=\"font1\">זוהמה</span>, spiritual poison, of the original serpent. Had Hagar become a free woman, not only would she not have absorbed the entire spiritual contamination that was still lodged within Abraham, but the fact that Isaac would have been born with some of it could have caused untold harm to the future of the Jewish people. Sarah insisted that Hagar remain a slave because of such considerations. How else could we explain that Sarah would allow Abraham to make a <span class=\"font1\">קדש</span>, male prostitute, of himself by sleeping with her slave? The reason she invited G'd to judge between them was because only G'd knew her true motives.",
                    "As soon as Sarah heard that Abraham did not doubt her pure motives and that he did not say anything when she not only treated Hagar as a slave, but more demonstratively than previously, Hagar took the hint and fled that household. Hagar did not accept the decision that reduced her again to the status of a slave. She had never heard the condition Sarah made at the time she gave her to Abraham to cohabit with. When the angel called to Hagar (16,8), he addressed her as <span class=\"font1\">שפחת שרה</span>, \"the slave-woman of Sarah,\" to make it clear that she had not been entitled to leave Sarah and Abraham's household in what she thought of as her new status as a free woman. Hagar immediately accepted the angel's rebuke by saying \"I flee from <b>my mistress Sarah.</b>\"",
                    "We must explore the legal status of Hagar's son Ishmael. Is he (and his offspring) subservient to us inasmuch as he was the son of a Jewish owned slave? There is a <i>Beraitha in Torat Kohanim</i> 87 on <span class=\"font1\">פרשת בהר</span> on the subject: Whence do we know that if a Jewish male fathered a son with a Gentile slave that this son is a slave of his? The words <span class=\"font1\"><b>אשר יהיו לך</b> מאת הגוים אשר סביבותיכם</span> in Leviticus 25,44 are considered as the source of this ruling. This verse only ruled out slaves who lived in the land of Canaan at the time the Jewish people conquered that land. The words \"who will be yours\" were quite unnecessary. Normally, the Torah would have used an expression such as \"whom you will purchase,\" or something similar. For this reason the author of the Beraitha understands the words as referring to as yet unborn children of a Gentile slave sired by a Jewish male. The law that remaining Canaanites had to be killed applied only to those who were already alive and in the land of Canaan at the time the Torah was given (Deut. 20,17). As a result of this ruling it emerges that Ishmael and all his offspring are truly slaves of the Jewsih people (legally speaking). There is no need to enter into the discussion we have described on page 149. Regardless of whether we view ourselves as Sarah's or as Abraham's heirs, Ishmael and offspring are included in our inheritance. Abraham inherited Sarah upon her death. He made Isaac his sole heir. G'd renewed the covenant with us the Jewish people to give us the lands He promised to Abraham. That land includes all the parts inhabited by Edom as well as the part of Esau shared with Ishmael's offspring.",
                    "The most convincing proof that we are correct is found in Genesis 21,13 where G'd promises that the son of the slave-woman (Hagar) will develop into a nation. It is important to note that the Torah does not refer to Ishmael as Abraham's son but as Hagar's son. Thus the Torah emphasises that Ishmael remains a slave, seeing that he is the son of a slave. If you wanted to see further proof of this look at the way the Torah describes the sons of Zilpah i.e. Leah's slave-woman, and the sons of Bilhah, i.e. Rachel's slave-woman. You will observe that when the Torah described those women giving birth (Genesis 30,5) that the sons are attributed to Jacob, not to their respective mothers. This means that because Jacob slept with them in order to establish a legal bond they became free women. In the reports of the births of all the four sons of Zilpah and Bilhah the Torah was careful to emphasise this point, (compare 30,7; 30,10; 30,12) In our case the Torah empahasises the difference in status between Ishmael and Isaac once more when we read: \"for through Isaac your seed will be known\" (Genesis 21,12) i.e. not through Ishmael. ",
                    "There was no need <b>to promise to give us</b> the lands of Ishmael since a slave does not own land and whatever land he lived on belonged to the Jewish people, his owner."

Abraham \"borrowed\" a phrase from Deut. 4,11 where the Torah describes the fact that the Jewish people were \"alive\" at that time as due to their having cleaved to G'd. Abraham saw the need to pray for this as he had observed negative character tendencies in Ishmael (who was still a minor). Had Ishmael been truly wicked at that time, Abraham, though prejudiced as his father, would have been aware of such wickedness, just as any other righteous person could perceive such things. We have explained in connection with 15,2-3 that Abraham had worried about a son of his not being worthy because G'd described his seeds as comparable to dust.

Rabbi Chama son of Chanina stated that this vision occurred on the third day after the circumcision. G'd came and enquired after Abraham's wellbeing. How did Rabbi Chama know that it was the third day? If we were to deduce this from Genesis 34,25, where we are told that the third day after the people of Shechem had circumsised themselves was a day they experienced additional pains, this cannot be, because we have a definitive statement in <i>Shabbat</i> 134 that the first and second day after the circumcision are <b>more</b> dangerous to the patient! True, the Talmud there distinguishes between the pain and the relative healing process experienced by adults (pain lasts longer, healing occurs more slowly), compared to that experienced by minors. However, such a distinction applies <b>only</b> to the third day, not to the first two days. On the first two days everyone experiences the most pain.",

The third day is definitely the day such patients feel weakest. Regarding the danger of infection from the wound and danger to life, etc., the first two days are far more dangerous than the third day. Why should we assume then that G'd did not come and visit Abraham on the first or second day after the circumcision? I have found an interesting comment in the <i>Tur Yore Deah</i> item 335 in which he quotes this folio in the Talmud without mentioning that it was on the third day. According to that version the simple message of Rabbi Chama is that G'd came to pay a visit to the sick. [The discussion in <i>Shabbat</i> 134 concerns washing a baby with hot water on the third day after the circumcision if the third day is on the Sabbath; permission to do this indicates that on that day the baby's life is in danger. Ed.]",
                    "According to the opinion of <i>Ran</i> that the first and the third days are the most dangerous to the patient, whereas the second day is not sufficiently dangerous to desecrate the Sabbath, we can understand the matter better. When you do not feel in danger, G'd applies the general rule of not visiting the sick during the first three hours of the morning. On the first day one also does not visit the sick as we know from <i>Nedarim</i> 40. When Rava was sick, he told his household not to tell anyone on the first day about his being sick in order not to influence his horoscope negatively. Rashi explains this to mean \"that one should not talk about the sick person.\" [As long as the matter is not public knowledge an immediate cure may result without the debits and merits of the sick person being reviewed in heaven because of people talking about him. Ed.] However Rava did want the fact that he was sick publicised from the second day on, so that all those who hated him should rejoice over his being sick. This would help diminish his debits [in the accounts kept in the celestial ledger. Ed.]. Rabbi Chama did not think G'd visited on the first day, as such a visit would certainly not have gone unnoticed, and as a result tongues would have been set wagging. <i>Yerushalmi Peah</i> third chapter states that the relatives of a sick person may visit him immediately; this is because such visits do not contribute to the sickness of the patient becoming public knowledge. There is certainly no doubt that G'd Himself must be viewed as a very close relative of the sick person. However, a visit by G'd would most certainly attract attention. According to the opinion that there is no difference in the degree of danger on either of the respective three days, this would leave the question of why Rabbi Chama had to mention the third day as the day G'd visited Abraham. We may have to assume that these people had the version of the <i>Tur</i> which did not mention the third day at all."

Ed.] The reason he did not merely say <span class=\"font1\">פת</span> but <span class=\"font1\">פת לחם</span>, was a hint that this bread had inner properties, i.e. its numerical value being 78, or three times the numerical value (26) of the four-lettered Holy Name.

According to the rules of etiquette then, all three angels enquired.",
                    "<b><span class=\"font1\">שוב אשוב</span>. \"I will certainly return.\"</b> The reason the angel repeated the words <span class=\"font1\">שוב אשוב</span> and added the word <span class=\"font1\">והנה</span>, may be better understood on the basis of a tradition that when Isaac was born he suffered from a congenital defect; he was sterile. It was only after agreeing to be the sacrifice at the <span class=\"font1\">עקדה</span>, that he was cured of that defect. The angel hinted that he would have to return twice <span class=\"font1\">כעת חיה</span>, at a time when he would \"give life,\" in order that Sarah's son would be a true son, able to procreate. The words <span class=\"font1\">והנה בן לשרה</span> indicate that Sarah's son emanated from the left side of the emanations, the female, weaker side. The word <span class=\"font1\">והנה</span> emphasises this origin of Isaac in Sarah's domain. Only when the angel would return once more would the male component, i.e. Abraham's input, become dominant within Isaac. This occurred in Genesis 22,11 where the Torah reports that an angel called out to Abraham not to harm Isaac. The angel therefore had two tasks to perform, 1) to announce that there would be an Isaac, 2) that he would possess a soul that could procreate. The reason that G'd had to do this was related to Abraham's prayer on behalf of Ishmael in 17,19. I have written about that subject at the time.",
                    "Another meaning of the words <span class=\"font1\">ולשרה בן</span>, that Sarah would by then have a son, is to tell us that a son i.e. male issue, is dependent on the female element being predominant whereas daughters are the result of a preponderant male element during marital union. We know this from <i>Nidah</i> 31 based on Leviticus 12,2. The angel prophesied that the physical union of Abraham and Sarah which would result in her impregnation would correspond to the rules laid down, or hinted at, in Leviticus 12,2. [compare <i>Midrash Hagadol</i> in the name of Rabbi Yitzchak that the sex of the embryo is determined in accordance with whose orgasm occurs first. If the male completes his orgasm first, the result is a daughter, if the female is first, the result is a son. Ed.] Scripture alludes to who was first by the way the birth is described. Chronicles I 4 18, states: \"and his wife, the Jewess, gave birth to Yered, etc.\" [Every other issue mentioned in that chapter is described in terms of the husband fathering instead of as the wife giving birth. Ed.] In Genesis 22,24 the repetition of \"and his concubine <b>whose name was</b> Re-umah, etc.,\" is another example of the principle we described. The words \"whose name was\" were quite unnecessary otherwise. Accordingly, the angels attributed the forthcoming son to the predominance of the female, i.e. Sarah's input.",

Nonetheless I have seen a <i>Midrash</i> according to which the angel was disciplined for not addressing Sarah directly with the message, preferring to deliver it to Abraham. Angels are punished for inadvertently committed disobedience or minor deviations from the instructions they receive."

Furthermore, why did G'd say <span class=\"font1\">לאמר</span>, \"to say?\" In fact most of the verse is superfluous; all the Torah had to write was: \"Why did she laugh?\"",
                    "We must consider that the Torah reported Abraham as laughing at a similar message in 17,17 when G'd promised him children. We do not find that G'd reacted to Abraham's laughter in that instance. The ordinary reader would want to know why Abraham could laugh at the same kind of message and not arouse G'd's anger whereas when Sarah did the same, it evoked criticism from G'd. Onkelos was aware of this when he used different words to describe Abraham's and Sarah's laughter respectively (<span class=\"font1\">חדי</span> for Abraham's laughter, and <span class=\"font1\">חיכה</span> to describe Sarah's laughter in our verse here). Why did G'd react differently to the <b>same</b> word, <span class=\"font1\">צחק</span> when used by two different people?",
                    "Actually G'd's very reaction includes a hint of why He took exception to Sarah's laughter whereas He had not reacted at the time to Abraham's laughter. A close examination of the text will reveal that Abraham had reacted with (derisive) laughter at the time he received the message. Sarah, on the other hand, did not laugh until she had menstruated again, a clear sign that her youth had returned. She herself referred to her rejuvenation. This proves that she did not believe G'd's promise until <b>after</b> she experienced <b>proof</b> on her own body. It was this that G'd objected to. When G'd said: <span class=\"font1\">למה <b>זה</b> צחקה שרה</span>, He emphasised to Abraham that <b>this</b> laughter of Sarah was objectionable, whereas Abraham's at the time had not bothered Him. By her comment <b>after</b> the event that she now realised she would indeed bear a child, <span class=\"font1\">האף אמנם אלד, ואני זקנתי</span>, that now she was convinced she would bear a child despite her husband's age, Sarah showed that up until that time she had not believed <b>G'd capable</b> of arranging this.",

While we are aware of our sages' statement in <i>Baba Metzia</i> 87 that we learn from this verse that a lie is acceptable when it serves to preserve domestic peace between man and wife, why would we have to learn this from an <b>untrue</b> utterance of G'd? In view of our explanation of G'd's reaction to the finer nuances of Sarah's laughter we see that G'd had indeed spoken the truth concerning what Sarah had said. Until Sarah had menstruated she had thought of herself as too old to conceive and bear a child (hence derisive laughter). <b>After</b> she had menstruated, her laughter was no longer one of derision or disbelief but one of joy. She was doubly grateful to G'd that although Abraham had not yet demonstrated signs of rejuvenation, he surely would do so now."

As to the reason why she was not truthful, the Torah adds that this was because she was afraid. The Torah affords us an insight into the psychology of a trusted servant who is reprimanded by his master after having inadvertently committed an offense. When said servant reflects on the enormity of his mistake by contrasting it with the exalted stature of his master, he denies his mistake. This very denial is equivalent to an admission but said servant lacks the moral courage to say so. It was <b>Abraham</b> who challenged Sarah by saying: \"No, but you did laugh.\" He wanted her to make a confession of having laughed. Abraham was aware that what G'd wanted in such a situation was a specific confession. Our prophets have always urged us to confess, as per Proverbs 28,13: \"he who confesses and abandons sin will find mercy.\""

Abraham accompanied those two angels to see them off. He realised that these angels still had a mission to perform on earth, something which had been concealed from him. Abraham would become aware of those angels' mission after the event. G'd was concerned lest he would feel badly in retrospect if He would not now take him into His confidence. Our sages (<i>Tanchuma</i> item 5 on our portion) state that the reason G'd decided to take Abraham into His confidence was because Abraham entertained doubts about the justice of G'd having brought on the deluge.

Fairness would require that punishment takes into consideration the relative stature of the person who has been sinned against and that of the sinner. When a human being transgresses any commandment of his Creator, the Supreme Being, he and all his entourage deserves to be destroyed because of the stature of the One whom he sinned against. If G'd proceeds simply on the basis of the enormity of the crime because of the stature of the <span class=\"font1\">מתביש</span>, the one who has been slighted, the outcome of such proceedings is a foregone conclusion. If, on the other hand, G'd considers the relative insignificance of the <span class=\"font1\">מביש</span>, the human being who committed the crime, and He bases the judgment on arguments presented by both litigants, things might appear in a different light. In such a case even the people of the generation of the deluge might not have been found guilty of extinction. This is why G'd explains here to Abraham <span class=\"font1\">ארדה נא</span>, \"I will descend, i.e. I will not judge on the basis of My superior stature.\" I will keep in mind the inadequacies of the sinners themselves. We find something of this nature in Isaiah 43,26 where G'd offers: <span class=\"font1\">נשפטה יחד</span>, \"let Us judge on an <b>equal</b> basis,\" keeping in mind the inadequacies of the creatures. G'd says: \"If, after making full allowance for the inadequacies of any creature and ignoring My superior stature, the defendant still emerges as guilty, <span class=\"font1\">כלה</span>, there is no escape for him. If not, I will know if they deserve to be judged by this or any other yardstick. G'd does not literally descend to earth to gain knowledge He did not have, but G'd lowers His profile in order to give the defendant an additional chance to downgrade his sin.",

Because Lot realised this he was prepared to take risks for their sake against the inhabitants of his town. He told them to wash their feet, a custom he had learned from the way Abraham conducted himself with his guests. The Torah reports the details to show the difference between Abraham and Lot. Abraham commenced with his guests washing their feet, Lot suggested they sleep first. Lot did not mind if people who were idolators entered his home without first removing the traces of idolatry, something that Abraham was very particular about."

This was because Lot did not observe the commandments of the Torah as did Abraham. At Abraham's home the angels had no compunction about eating meat. The angels either knew that Lot had tithed the flour he used for baking the matzot, or they reasoned that in the absence of priests to give the tithe (<span class=\"font1\">תרומה</span>) to, they assumed that function themselves and ate the part which could be considered <i>terumah</i> whereas they did not eat the regular matzah. According to our sages (<i>Midrash Hagadol</i>), the date was the 16th of Nissan and Lot had baked matzah in anticipation of the eventual Passover holiday some 400 years hence."

Our sages in <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 50,5 mention that when questioned about the townspeople by the angels Lot said that whereas all over the world there are both good and wicked people in a town, in Sodom the people were mostly wicked. We have previously explained why the angels did not immediately destroy the town when they heard this. Besides, according to the <i>Midrash</i>, Lot asked them to spare the city and they accepted his plea. It was only after they were about to add further sins (verse 5) to their already full register that the angels told Lot to save himself and his relatives (verse 12) prior to their destroying the city. There was an additional reason why the angels did not immediately destroy the town. They waited till morning, a period when the attribute of Mercy is in the ascendancy; at that time they would succeed in saving Lot. They could not have done this during the night. Our sages add that since the Sodomites worshipped both sun and moon they were smitten at a time when the moon is full (middle of the month) and the sun shone, to show that neither force protected them."

By the same token Avimelech felt that if he personally was righteous this reflected on his entire people; it follows that if G'd were to kill him for a crime he had not committed, G'd would, in effect, kill a whole nation that was innocent.

The reason the Torah underlines <span class=\"font1\">לאברהם</span> is to make it clear that only this son is to be viewed as an extension of Abraham, not Ishmael, as we read later in 21,12. Even though the Torah described Hagar as bearing a son \"for Abraham\" (16,15), the fact is that at that time Abraham was still called Abram.

Concerning love with one's soul, the Torah mentions <span class=\"font1\">יחידך</span>; when a person has no children he is alone and considered as dead. Love with one's soul is therefore love with the only thing one has left to love with. The words <span class=\"font1\">אשר אהבת</span> refer to one's possessions; G'd meant that Abraham loved Isaac more than all his other possessions.

In view of G'd having addressed Abraham by day, perhaps he should not have waited until the following day; it is possible that he received the instructions in the late afternoon or that Isaac was not at home at the time.

                    "<i>Midrash Hagadol 23,2</i> claims that the reason Sarah died was that she was unable to make peace with the fact that Isaac was spared at the last moment.

As to my second explanation that she \"lost\" a number of years of the life that had been intended for her, you need to understand the kindness that G'd does with the righteous. When such a righteous person dies \"prematurely,\" for reasons such as in Sarah's case, G'd does not deduct from the sum total of their achievements what such a person would have achieved had he not died before his allotted time.

The reason the town was mentioned and was so named is to tell us that it was built on the four basic elements. Death normally implies a departure from, or disintegration of, the four basic elements that a body is composed of. When the Torah adds that \"Kiryat Arba\" is also known as <span class=\"font1\">חברון</span>, this is an allusion to the word <span class=\"font1\">חבור</span>, something that is joined together. The message is that when the righteous \"die,\" this is not to be viewed as a process of disintegration. The righteous are still called \"alive\" even when they have ceased to function in regular bodies on this earth. The story in <i>Shabbat</i> 152 about how the grave of Rabbi Achai bar Yoshiah was disturbed by diggers on a property of Rav Nachman and how Rabbi Achai reacted illustrates this concept. What all this means is that while the righteous are alive in this world, the four basic <b>material</b> elements that every human being is composed of become transformed into something spiritual and attach themselves to their souls by means of the good deeds that such persons perform during their sojourn on earth. Maimonides illustrates this somewhat in the fourth chapter of <i>Hilchot Yesodey Torah</i> where he describes that one element is capable of becoming transformed into another element which was similar to it, i.e. earth can be transformed into water. When man cleaves to G'd all his elements become transformed into the element fire which forms the basis of the soul. Kabbalists are familiar with this.",

We need to appreciate that our holy Torah applies reason, and especially so in our conduct on this earth. Just as we Jews are commanded to deal with resident strangers in a humane manner, so reason dictates that people all over the earth should conduct themselves with one another in a like manner. It is a universal obligation to enable resident strangers to live undisturbed and to be able to receive gifts. It is this principle Abraham alluded to when he said: <span class=\"font1\">גר ותושב אנכי תנו לי</span>, \"since I am a resident stranger, give me, etc.\" He made a point of using the word <span class=\"font1\">גר</span>, alien, not just <span class=\"font1\">תושב</span>, resident, in order to emphasise that though he was an alien, the fact that he resided amongst them entitled him to what he requested.

They indicated that Abraham was aware that no one would dare protest what he set out to do. Just because he was a man of such calibre the usual practice of acquiring land by occupying it and no one protesting did not apply to him. As soon as they would feel powerful enough they would feel free to remove the body Abraham had buried on that land. What they conveyed was that their approval was only due to Abraham representing superior force. 2) A second way of interpreting the Hittites' response is as follows: Inasmuch as you are \"a prince of G'd,\" you need not fear that we look upon you as a person who throws his weight around such as in the example quoted from the Talmud. Whereas the people in the household of the exilarch were suspected of robbery, no such motive would ever be attributed to Abraham. Abraham's righteousness was beyond question. Perhaps they used the word <span class=\"font1\">שמענו</span>, \"listen to us,\" in order to underline that they considered Abraham beyond reproof. Hearing this, Abraham responded: \"if you truly wish me to bury my dead, etc.\" please act as brokers between me and Efron. Had it not been for the latter words of Abraham we would have been forced to conclude that the Hittites' offer was something based on duress."

He was also careful to add the words: \"in your midst.\" The <i>Zohar</i> 1,128 points out that Efron never saw anything in that cave except darkness and calamity. This being so, Efron could have claimed later that in view of his having been unaware of the true value of the cave, his consent to sell it was based on a false premise, and he could have reversed the sale. This in spite of the rule that there is no validity to a claim of land having been over or underpriced at the time of sale. Abraham still worried about an idea expressed in the Jerusalem Talmud (compare <i>Tossaphot Kidushin</i> 42) that if the undercharge was 50% or more the sale is reversible although it is not reversible when the amount of the undercharge was between 15% and 50%.",
                    "There was also the concern that landowners of the adjoining property could claim that the land should have been sold to them in preference to an outsider, something known in Jewish law as <span class=\"font1\">דין המצר</span>. Another consideration of Abraham was that after the transfer of the cave someone might present a lien dated prior to the transaction which would require him to give up his claim. For all these reasons Abraham used both the expression of \"gift\" and \"sale\" when referring to the way he wanted to acquire the cave. This would protect his claim also under the heading of what is known in Jewish law as <span class=\"font1\">דין חליפין</span>, i.e. acquisition by means of a symbolic transfer. Under this heading there is no such law as <span class=\"font1\">אונאה</span>, reversal of the sale due to unfair pricing. This <span class=\"font1\">דין חליפין</span> applies to transactions involving either real estate or chattels whereas such acquisition by a symbol representing the ultimate object does not apply to money, i.e. coins. Hence Abraham's reference to receiving the land as a gift. Our sages in <i>Bechorot</i> 50 phrased it thus: Rabbi Chaninah stated that every time the word \"<span class=\"font1\">כסף</span>\" i.e. silver or money appears in the Torah, the meaning is \"<span class=\"font1\">סלעים</span>\", <span>25</span> silver coins of a standard denomination; the exception is the use of the word \"shekel\" in connection with the transaction involving Abraham and Efron. In that instance the meaning is <span class=\"font1\">קנטרין</span>, a coin weighing four times the usual weight of the \"shekel.\" This is the meaning of the Torah (Genesis 23,15) defining the \"shekel\" as being \"four hundred shekel acceptable at any merchant.\" The fact that Efron arbitrarily changed the usual definition of the value of the \"shekel,\" made the transaction unassailable in the future seeing he himself had set the terms of the sale. Concerning Abraham's fear that the <span class=\"font1\">דין מצר</span> might be invoked by a neighbour in the future, Abraham ensured the presence and consent of all the local populace who would jointly act as his broker in the transaction.

                    "<b><span class=\"font1\">ואחרי כן…ויקם השדה</span>. Afterwards the field stood as burial plot, etc.</b> We need to understand why the Torah had to write the words: \"afterwards,\" something that is obvious. What could be more natural than Abraham burying Sarah at the end of these negotiations? Besides, why did the Torah repeat the words: <span class=\"font1\">ויקם השדה</span>, something we read already in verse 17? ",
                    "The Torah wanted to confirm that the transaction complied with all and every legal form of acquisition. The words \"afterwards\" mean that once Abraham had weighed the money for Efron the latter had foregone all claim to that property in perpetuity. Maimonides explains it thus in chapter one of <i>Hilchot Zechiyah Umatanah:</i> \"A Gentile loses his right to formerly owned property the moment he accepts the money as compensation for it. A Jew, on the other hand, does not acquire title to his new property until he has a written document. Once this has occurred the property in question is like land in the desert which anyone can stake a claim to.\" In other words, once the Gentile has accepted the money he loses all former claims. Had Abraham buried Sarah <b>before</b> giving the money to Efron, the fact that he gave the money to Efron afterwards would not have made a full acquisition, seeing that the act of possession expressed by his burying Sarah would not have been performed on land <b>owned by him at the time.</b> ",
                    "We need to examine if the act of <span class=\"font1\">חזקה</span>, i.e. using the land for one's own purpose, is actually legally valid when the act of such <span class=\"font1\">חזקה</span> is performed on land previously owned by a Gentile. In chapter two of the above-mentioned tractate of Maimonides, he writes as follows: \"In the case of formerly ownerless property, or property formerly owned by a proselyte, the fact that the squatter (Jewish) has eaten the proceeds of such land for a number of years does not constitute an act of acquisition of either tree or the land itself until such time as the squatter has performed an act on the body of the land itself. What kind of activity would qualify in such an event? In the case of a Jew having taken over the house of a proselyte or an abandoned house, if he whitewashed it or added a moulding about 60 centimeters high this would constitute a valid act of acquisition. If he took earth from high ground and transferred it to fill lower ground in the same piece of land this would be considered as an improvement of the earth and would qualify as an act of acquisition.\" It is clear therefore that if the squatter merely shifted some earth without specific intent to effect an improvement on that soil- even though he thereby levelled the ground,- this would not be enough to qualify under the heading of <span class=\"font1\">קנין</span>, acquisition. <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> (a commentator on Maimonides) writes that if the squatter spread mats on the ground in order to be able to sit on it in comfort and to enjoy this, this would count as a valid act of <span class=\"font1\">קנין</span>, acquisition. An alternative cited by the above commentator suggests that even spreading the mats merely in order to improve the appearance of the ground in question suffices. Rabbi <i>lbn Migosh</i> concurs with the latter example. Thus far the quotation from <i>Hilchot Zechiyah Umatanah.</i> Granted that according to the first example cited by the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> anyone who benefits from an act performed on the land he squats on performs a valid act of <span class=\"font1\">חזקה</span>, Abraham benefited by having buried Sarah on that land and thereby performed an act of acquisition; however, according to the opinion of Rabbi <i>lbn Migosh</i> that an actual <b>improvement</b> of the land has to take place, Sarah's burial would not have constituted such an improvement. How then did Abraham acquire that land (even though Efron had forfeited it)?",
                    "Perhaps the superstructure erected around the grave, and especially the sepulchral chambers dug within the earth which was customary at the time, constituted such an improvement in the field under discussion. These sepulchral chambers were probably white-washed with lime to prevent the earth around them from crumbling. Now we can understand the reason the Torah repeated the words <span class=\"font1\">ויקם השדה</span>. It means that after Abraham had buried Sarah the acquisition of that field by Abraham became complete."

                    "<b> <span class=\"font1\">ואלה תולדת</span>, And these are the developments, etc.</b> Why did the Torah mention the birth of Isaac instead of the birth of his children at this point? Why did the Torah need to tell us here that Abraham fathered Isaac?",
                    "The intent of the Torah may be understood thus. \"And these are Isaac's developments,\" refers to events that are mentioned later on in this <span class=\"font1\">פרשה</span>. Seeing the Torah will speak about the sons of Isaac, and Isaac himself was not originally capable of siring children since his own existence had been rooted in the \"left\" side of the emanations [until the fact that he submitted to the binding on the altar resulted in his \"graduating\" to the status of someone born under the aegis of the \"right\" side of the emanations (kabbalistic concept) compare 22,2 Ed.], the reader might have asked how Isaac could sire children at all? The Torah therefore hints in this way that the fact that <b>Abraham</b> had fathered Isaac enabled him to bestow upon Isaac the ability to beget children.",
                    "Alternately, the Torah may refer to <i>Yevamot</i> 64, where we learn that when two righteous people offer a prayer simultaneously, if one of them is also the son of a righteous person G'd will listen to his prayer first. This is why the Torah described G'd as listening to Isaac's prayer in 25,22. Accordingly, the words: <span class=\"font1\">אברהם הוליד את יצחק</span> means that Abraham's righteousness was a factor in G'd enabling Isaac to have children.",
                    "A further meaning may be connected to <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 63,2 which explains Isaiah 29,22, where the prophet describes the as yet unborn Jacob as having redeemed Abraham, i.e. saved him from Nimrod's furnace. Had it not been for Jacob's merit Abraham might not have survived that experience. Our verse then would hint that it was only the combined merit of Jacob and Isaac that enabled Abraham to live long enough to beget Isaac.",
                    "The wording of our verse contains an additional meaning of the word <span class=\"font1\">תולדת</span>, \"developments, offspring, generations.\" The true \"offspring\" of the righteous are their good deeds. The various trials Isaac underwent during his life are not specifically described as such by the Torah, although it was he who offered his life to G'd on the altar at Moriah. There are even commentators (such as <i>lbn Ezra</i> 22,4) who claim that Isaac submitted only against his will. In order to prevent us from arriving at such a conclusion the Torah describes Isaac once more as a true offspring of Abraham, someone who was in no way inferior to his father in his love for and obedience to G'd. This is stressed both by the word <span class=\"font1\"><b>בן</b> אברהם</span> and the conjunctive letter <span class=\"font1\">ו</span> before the word <span class=\"font1\">אלה</span>. Isaac continued to accumulate meritorious deeds just as Abraham had done before him.",
                    "The Torah may also simply hint that Isaac had only one son who followed in the footsteps of Abraham, i.e. \"and these are the generations of Isaac, the one who was a true son of Abraham.\"",
                    "Still another meaning may be gleaned from the wording \"Abraham begat Isaac.\" Whereas Isaac did indeed match Abraham in good deeds, he could not receive the same credit since he had his father as an example and could model himself accordingly. Abraham was unique. He was \"self-made,\" did not have a father who served as his role model. This was the reason that the prophet Isaiah (Isaiah 41,8) quotes G'd as describing Abraham as \"the one who loved Him.\" Abraham had had to initiate this love towards his Creator without the Creator having served as a guiding light for him first.",
                    "Another reason that Isaac is described as the son of Abraham here once again is to teach us that a <span class=\"font1\">צדיק</span> who is himself the son of a <span class=\"font1\">צדיק</span> is in class by himself, not to be compared to a <span class=\"font1\">צדיק</span> who is the son of a <span class=\"font1\">רשע</span>. Even though <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 38,12 states that Abraham's father Terach became a penitent before he died, he had been wicked for most of his life. The activities of a sinful father cast a pall over the spiritual light spread by the son. When looked at from that vantage point Isaac was better prepared for a pious life than his father. All this is included in the wording <span class=\"font1\">ואלה תולדת יצחק בך אברהם</span>.",
                    "Isaac did not experience all the painful experiences that Abraham endured. The Torah explains the reason why by writing that he was the son of Abraham. He was the first beneficiary of his father Abraham's great and cumulative merit. If Abraham experienced far more turbulence in his life this was because it could not be said of him that a great man fathered him."

The words <span class=\"font1\">בקחתו את רבקה</span>, explain that he had to wait that long in order to marry this particular girl. The words: \"<span class=\"font1\">לו לאשה</span>\" \"for him as a wife,\" spell out that only this woman could have fulfilled the role of becoming Isaac's wife. Prior to Rebeccah's birth no <span class=\"font1\">בת זוג</span>, suitable potential wife, had existed for Isaac. We have explained in the last <span class=\"font1\">פרשה</span> that Rebeccah was very young, having only been born when Isaac lay bound on the altar (at the age of 37) and thus became capable of fathering issue.

Inasmuch as the Torah tells us in the next verse that G'd responded to Isaac's prayer (though both of them prayed simultaneously), someone might have concluded that Rebeccah did not merit that her prayer should be answered by G'd; the Torah explains therefore that the <b>only</b> reason G'd did not respond to her prayer at the time was the fact that her father was the wicked Bethuel. Repeating the information that this Bethuel was an <span class=\"font1\">ארמי</span>, is an allusion to the other way of spelling these letters, i.e. <span class=\"font1\">רמאי</span>, swindler. The Torah deliberately did not mention the town Bethuel lived in in order to have a chance to allude to the fact that the man was a swindler.",
                    "The reason that the Torah again mentions that Rebeccah was a sister of Laban, something we already knew from the encounter of Eliezer and Laban at the well, is in order explain why such a fine woman gave birth to the wicked Esau. Having both a father who was a swindler and a brother who was a master swindler in her background, the marvel was Rebeccah's innocence, not the fact that one of her sons might turn out to be wicked. <i>Baba Batra</i> 110 already remarks that most sons turn out to have a character resembling that of their mother's brothers. The Torah attests that Rebeccah herself was an absolutely righteous woman when Isaac her husband is described as praying in the presence of his wife. Should you ask why Isaac did not examine Rebeccah's brother's character before he decided to marry her, we have already answered that she was the <b>only</b> woman who was his <span class=\"font1\">בת זוג</span>, divinely appointed to become his wife. Had this not been so Isaac would never have married the sister of a wicked person such as Laban.",
                    "The words <span class=\"font1\">אחות לבן</span> also allude to the reason that Rebeccah was barren for so many years. According to <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 60,13 this was in order that her fertility could not be credited to the blessings bestowed upon her by her brother Laban in 24,60. The Torah therefore alludes to the cause of barrenness <b>before</b> mentioning the fact that she could not conceive. It was because she was Laban's sister that she needed to wait to conceive until her husband's prayer."

Their prayer was that the semen should not go to waste (compare <i>Berachot</i> 60 on the subject of semen turning unfit for conception)."

Rashi explains that \"if the pain involved in giving birth is so intense, why did I bother to pray to become pregnant?\" It is difficult to reconcile our image of the pious and righteous Rebeccah with Rashi's comment, i.e. that she did not think the pain worth her while in order to become a mother. Also, if that had been her real concern, how did G'd's response alleviate her problem? Our rabbis have offered many and various explanations none of which are acceptable as the plain meaning of the verse. The plain meaning of the word <span class=\"font1\">ויתרצצו</span> is based on the root <span class=\"font1\">רצץ</span>, to crush. Since there were two fetuses in her womb she felt as if her womb was being crushed. She was afraid that she could not complete her pregnancy and would have a miscarriage as a result. Her question then was rhetorical, i.e. \"what good was my becoming pregnant if this pregnancy will not be completed successfully?\" The words: \"she went to ask G'd,\" mean that she prayed to G'd to let her complete her pregnancy without mishap. She felt that the miracle of her becoming pregnant after all these years surely should not be wasted by her not giving birth to a healthy child."

                    "<b> <span class=\"font1\">ויאמר ה׳ לה</span>, G'd said to her, etc.</b> Although this verse has been explained by many there is still no truly satisfactory answer. G'd responded to her fear that she would miscarry by explaining to her that there was nothing medically wrong in her womb but that she was carrying two instead of merely one fetus. Whereas normally, when a mother expects twins, the two fetuses get along inside the womb (compare Song of Songs 7,4), in Rebeccah's case they did not. Hence her feeling of being crushed. She did not merely carry twins but each one was destined to become a nation with very different characteristics from one another. Not only would each one be a king in his own right, but these respective nations would endure for thousands of years. All of this would not have resulted in her having a feeling of being crushed were it not for the fact that these twins did not conform to the usual pattern of twins. When G'd explained that <span class=\"font1\">ממעיך יפרדו</span>, \"they will be totally separate already while still inside of you,\" this meant that they would not only be separate inside of Rebeccah but their being separate would continue after they were born. At any rate, G'd reassured Rebeccah that there was nothing wrong with her womb.",

We find an example of this concept in a statement in <i>Megillah</i> 6 that the city of Tzor attained its true prominence only through the fall of Jerusalem. Seeing that each nation therefore anxiously awaits the downfall of the other, there is no hope that they will live together in brotherly harmony.",
                    "<b><span class=\"font1\">ורב יעבד צעיר</span>, \"and the senior one will serve the younger.\"</b> None of the many commentaries on this expression seem to do justice to the words. Our approach will solve the problem. Not only will one of these two nations attain its respective grandeur at the expense of the other, but the nation which is defeated will wind up in servitude to the respective victor. The victor will not content himself with having vanquished his antagonist and deprived him of his assets, but he will oppress him to boot. This will further inhibit any chance of reconciliation and will increase the degree of mutual hatred. This is what the Talmud (<i>Ketuvot</i> 72) had in mind when it stated that a human being and a snake cannot live together in cramped quarters. The words do not mean that Esau and Jacob respectively will live in such a dependence on each other; the meaning is that whoever will be the senior one of these two nations during different periods of history will relate to the other as a tyrannical overlord."

He did not bother to engage in such trickery except when dealing with his father. This was because he was not concerned about the performance of good deeds but only wanted to ensure his father would have no reason to curse him. He also hoped to obtain blessings. His mother could not dispense either, therefore he made no effort to camouflage his true self when in his mother's presence. This is why we find later on (27,41) that Esau waited for the death of his father before killing Jacob, whereas he did not wait for his mother to die before committing murder. The reason Rebeccah did not inform Isaac of Esau's wickedness may have been that Esau was careful never to put on such a charade in her presence so as not to give his mother an excuse to challenge Isaac's love for him. According to Onkelos who renders the words <span class=\"font1\">כי ציד בפיו</span> as <span class=\"font1\">ארי מצידה הוי אכיל</span>, \"that Isaac ate from the game Esau hunted,\" we must ask why this reason did not also cause Rebeccah to love Esau, for surely they took most of their meals together or at least Esau did not discriminate against her? Perhaps the reason is that in accordance with the commentary of the <i>Maharik on Even Ha-ezer</i> 70,1 Isaac was under an obligation to feed his wife a meat diet. When a wife comes from a family who is used to such a diet the husband must keep her in the style she was accustomed to. Bethuel was a wealthy and influential man in his town, and no doubt Rebeccah had been used to a high standard of living prior to her marriage. She would not therefore be particularly grateful for the venison, considering it merely as her due."

There are aspects to the birthright which do not become effective until after the death of the father, and as such they are legally considered as <span class=\"font1\">דבר שלא בא לעולם</span>, something the eventual existence of which is still subject to doubt. The claim to such things cannot legally be established on an \"if and when\" basis. Jacob added the words \"as of this day\" in order to make the sale legal <b>at this time.</b> This is in accordance with <i>Baba Metzia</i> 16 and <i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 211,2. When someone who is poor and does not have what to eat goes hunting and offers the proceeds of his hunt for sale adding that such sale be effective \"today,\" the sale is valid. The reason for this is that the poor man desperately needs the proceeds from such a sale. The Geonim write that the word \"today\" is not critical to the effectiveness of such a sale. Even if the sale was to be effective the day after it would still be valid. The decisive criterion is the critical need for the proceeds of the sale. The only reason the Talmud mentions the word \"today\" is to exclude dates such as \"after thirty days or longer.\" As long as the time stipulated for the sale to take effect is within one day so that the seller can assure his survival during this space of time he has met the important criterion. When Jacob said \"<span class=\"font1\">כיום</span>,\" he did not mean \"today\" but \"in accordance with the rule applying to sales that take effect within a day. He saw Esau was very tired and weak and providing this food for him at that time was a matter of survival. Had Esau not been in a temporarily desperate situation the sale would not have been legal."

He said: \"swear it to me on an oath.\"</b> The reason that Jacob requested an oath from Esau was because the whole institution of the birthright contains many intangibles, such as the honour and dignity conferred on the firstborn. Jacob was particularly interested in the privilege of performing duties in the Temple, something which was the duty of the firstborn at that time. We are conversant with the rule that a person cannot transfer the right to intangibles either by sale or by gift (<i>Maimonides Hilchot Mechirah</i> chapter 22). This is why Jacob insisted on making such acquisition by means of an oath. <i>Yoreh Deah</i> 239 rules that both tangibles and intangibles may be acquired by means of an oath.",
                    "Jacob used the words \"swear it to me.\" Actually the oath is not sufficient to acquire an intangible which does not even exist yet such as becoming heir to one's father if the latter dies before the heir. The reason is that the purchaser cannot truly have convinced himself that he will ever obtain what he has purchased (<i>Baba Metzia</i> 16). If, however, the purchaser was absolutely certain in his mind, the object has indeed been acquired and the oath is quite irrelevant. This is why Jacob had to add the words <span class=\"font1\">כיום</span>, as I have explained already. In the meantime I have found a book of the <i>Rivash</i> in which he writes as follows in the course of item number 328. \"You have written that you have seen that the son of the <i>Rosh</i> wrote in the name of his father that if someone tried to acquire a \"future\" by means of an oath such an acquisition is legally valid. He proves the thesis from the sale of the birthright from Esau to Jacob and the fact that the latter insisted on an oath. Since we have neither the signature of the <i>Rosh</i> or his son Rabbi Yaakov to confirm such a theory, it is not admissible to place such theories in the mouths of great men [in order to lend them weight Ed.] seeing that the theory has absolutely no merit. The \"so-called\" proof from our story is no proof at all seeing that all this occurred before the Torah was given to the Jewish people. It is quite possible that in those days people did not distinguish between selling \"futures\" and selling \"actuals.\" The oath then would merely have served to reinforce the sale, to protect oneself against the seller changing his mind at a later date. Esau was, after all, a man of violence.\" Thus far the <i>Rivash.</i> This is exactly in agreement with what we have written, the only difference being that the <i>Rivash</i> did not see fit to provide a reason <b>why</b> Jacob insisted on an oath.",
                    "The reason Jacob said: \"swear an oath on it <b>to me,</b>\" instead of merely \"swear an oath on it,\" is so that it would be understood that the sale was for the benefit of Jacob (not for someone else). The oath had to be acceptable to Jacob else Esau could have annulled it in his heart. The essential element of an oath is the heart, i.e. what a person has in mind at the time of the oath (compare Rabbi Akiva in <i>Torat Kohanim</i> 12). Rabbi Akiva insists that at the time an oath is sworn the person undertaking it must have no reservations about the declaration he makes on oath. When Jacob said \"swear it to me,\" he meant: \"make your oath correspond to my will.\"",
                    "Another reason Jacob was careful to add the word <span class=\"font1\">לי</span> \"to me,\" was that only he was able to acquire the birthright. Inasmuch as the benefits of the birthright include such intangibles as the duty to perform sacrificial service in the sanctuary, this was something that devolved from Isaac to his son. This privilege could not be sold to anyone who was not a son of Isaac. The dignity of the office of the priesthood (in those days equivalent to the birthright) could also not be transferred to an outsider.",
                    "<b><span class=\"font1\">וימכור את בכרתו</span>, He sold his birthright, etc.</b> The Torah here had to state the validity of the sale a) because of the reasons we have explained, b) because Esau acted under some kind of duress, c) that Esau sold something for a mere fraction of its real worth. In his commentary on <i>Choshen Mishpat</i> item 227, the <i>Maharik</i> writes as follows: \"if someone sold something due to pressing need even at a price significantly below its accepted market value, he cannot retract because he was aware of what he was doing and forgave the difference in value to the purchaser.\" In view of this ruling the fact that Esau sold the valuable birthright for a single swallow of Jacob's potage did not invalidate the sale. Esau had described his state of exhaustion as: \"here I am about to die;\" there is no greater emergency than a person selling something in order to save his life. We know from Job 2,4 that a person will give up all that he has for his life. Had Esau not been in such a state, Jacob could not have acquired the birthright from him. When Solomon said in Proverbs 5,22 that the wicked will be entrapped by their iniquities, he had Esau in mind. According to <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 63,14 Esau had committed a number of sins on that fateful day and this was the reason that he forfeited the birthright which was transferred to someone more deserving than he."

The validity of that covenant extended for three generations into the future. Nachmanides attempts to answer this problem claiming that Avimelech was simply afraid that Isaac would not honour a covenant made by his father seeing that Avimelech on his part had violated the agreement by expelling Isaac. I have not seen anywhere that part of the agreement between Abraham and Avimelech included the right of Abraham or his descendants to reside in the land of the Philistines. There was therefore no breach of the agreement when Avimelech asked Isaac to leave Gerar, and the problem we have raised remains unanswered. ",
                    "We have learned in <i>Nedarim</i> 65 that if someone has denied himself (by a vow) the benefit of anything owned by a second party such a vow can be annulled only in the presence of the other affected party. The Talmud understood the words of the Torah in which Moses agreed to stay with Yitro as a vow not to return to Pharaoh in Egypt. When G'd told Moses to return to Egypt the Torah says: \"G'd said to Moses <b>in Midian</b> 'go return to Egypt\" (Exodus 4,19). There too the words \"in Midian\" appear superfluous at first glance, except for the fact that G'd told Moses that seeing he had made his vow in Midian that was the place he had to annul it. Concerning the rule that the annulment has to take place where the vow was made originally, we find the following glossary in <i>Haga-ot Maimoniyot</i> chapter six of <i>Hilchot Shevuot: Ri</i> states that this ruling applies in that form only as a desirable (<span class=\"font1\">לחתחילה</span>) form of annulment. If, however, the vow was revoked by the person who made it in the absence of the person affected by it, such an annulment is valid. Even the rule that it is desirable that the person who was the subject of the vow be present at the annulment applies only when the person who denied himself any benefits of that party had originally been the recipient of a favour by that party, such as Moses to whom Yitro had given his daughter, or King Zedekiah who had been set free by King Nebuchdnezzar. When no such benefit had been received by the person who has made the vow there is no need for the subject of the annulment to be present at all, as we know from <i>Sotah</i> 36. Thus far the quote from <i>Haga-ot Maimoniyot.</i> From the above it is clear that the person who uttered the oath denying himself benefits from a second party can proceed to have this oath annulled without bothering about the presence of the second party involved. The question of whether Abraham had obtained benefits from Avimelech prior to having sworn an oath to him is therefore irrelevant. As a matter of record, Abraham received absolutely no benefit from Avimelech. The gifts that Avimelech gave him were only in expiation for the humiliation he had caused Sarah. The report in the Torah shows clearly that Abraham departed from Gerar immediately after that episode and settled in Beer Sheva. Abraham did not accept Avimelech's gifts in order to remain in Gerar but moved to Beer Sheva where Isaac also lived after his expulsion from Gerar. I have found a statement recorded in <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 54,2 on Genesis 21,23 where Avimelech refers to the kindness he showed Abraham and requests a kindness in return. The \"kindness\" was Avimelech's <b>offer</b> to Abraham to reside in the land of the Philistines, an offer which Abraham declined. The request to conclude a treaty was meant to be Abraham's quid pro quo for that offer. When the Torah quotes Avimelech as having <b>performed</b> acts of kindness towards Abraham, the Torah reports Avimelech's own version, not an historical fact. Isaac, on the other hand, did remain in the land of the Philistines, prospering greatly during his sojourn there. When the Torah reports Avimelech as going to Isaac <b>from Gerar</b> this means \"on account of the legal situation deriving from Isaac's stay in Gerar.\" Abraham had not accepted Avimelech's offer at the time, and could therefore annul his oath without the presence (agreement) of Avimelech. The fact that Isaac did accept Avimelech's offer, made it impossible for him to annul Abraham's covenant without the presence (agreement) of Avimelech.",
                    "We may assume that Abraham did not agree with the approach of the <i>Ri</i> when Avimelech made Abraham swear the covenant but agreed with the approach of Maimonides. The latter writes in <i>Hilchot Shevuot</i> chapter 6 that whoever makes his fellow man render an oath cannot annul such an undertaking unless the other party is present even though he had not received any benefit from the party requesting the oath. Maimonides does agree, however, that if this provision was ignored the annulment is still valid precisely because the party who swore never received any benefit from his opposite number. Later halachic authorities such as the <i>Raa'vad, Rashba</i> and others feel that such an annulment is not valid even ipso facto, i.e. <span class=\"font1\">בדיעבד</span>. Avimelech wanted to cover all his bases and therefore went to Isaac and took with him Phichol and Achuzat to lend added strength to the agreement to be forged, as we shall explain.",

                    "We may understand this with the help of a comment by <i>Ran</i> in <i>Nedarim</i> 65. He expresses doubt as to the ruling about the affected party having to be present when the vow is revoked unless the vow was designed originally to be of benefit to the party becoming its subject. [King Zedekiah (Chronicles II 36,13 as interpreted by the Talmud <i>Nedarim</i> 65), had vowed not to reveal the fact that he had observed king Nebuchadnezzar eat a raw hare. Had this fact become common knowledge, Nebuchadnezzar's image would have suffered amongst his subjects. Zedekiah therefore should not have had his vow annulled without the presence (consent) of Nebuchadnezzar, seeing such annulment was to his detriment. Ed.] <i>Ran</i> quotes unnamed sources who hold that the whole rule of requiring the consent (presence) of the second party is valid only if the second party would suffer embarassment if the party who made the vow originally now wants to annul it. Other authorities hold, however, that the reason for the rule is to ensure that the second party does not inadvertently commit a sin by not being aware that the vow had been annulled. According to the latter view, when the vow had not conferred a benefit upon the second party, it suffices <b>to inform</b> the second party, his presence or consent is not required. According to the former view the affected party's presence (consent) would be required as a condition for such annulment to become valid.",
                    "Avimelech may have been astute enough to try and prevent Isaac from annulling his (or his father's) vow by converting the covenant made with Abraham (in private) into a covenant made in public. We have learned in <i>Gittin</i> 46 that according to the view of Rabbi Yehudah a vow made in public can never be annulled. On folio 36 the Talmud quotes the opinion of Amemar that even according to the view that vows made in public are subject to annulment this is so only when the vow was not made with the consent of the people present at the time such vow was made. <i>Tossaphot</i> explain that Amemar does not necessarily disagree with the view of Rabbi Yehudah that publicly made vows are not subject to annulment. It emerges from the opinion expressed by Rav Yoseph in <i>Pessachim</i> 107 that the discussion is resolved in favour of the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah, whereas at the end of the discussion the other rabbis rule in favour of the opinion expressed by the <i>Rabbanan.</i> Later authorities, i.e. the Geonim, again rule in favour of Rabbi Yehudah. At any rate, Avimelech took along an entourage, i.e. Achuzat and others in order to make the vow they wanted Isaac to undertake qualify as an oath made in public and therefore not subject to annulment at any future time. Our rabbis in <i>Gittin</i> disagree on how many people must be present in order for such a vow to be considered \"public.\" Rabbi Nachman holds that the presence of three people suffices, whereas Rabbi Yitzchok holds that there has to be a quorum of ten people. After perusing what our sages have written on this subject in <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 64,2 concerning the meaning of <span class=\"font1\">ואחוזת מרעהו</span>, I found that Rabbi Yehudah defines the meaning as simply the name of the person, whereas Rabbi Nechemyah understands it as a procession of wellwishers. Perhaps the disagreement mentioned in that <i>Midrash</i> is parallel to the disagreement whether three or ten people are required in order to qualify a vow as having been made in public. At any rate we may view Avimelech as having made sure that sufficient people were present to make Isaac's vow irrevocable.",
                    "Perhaps Avimelech was so astute that he wanted to ensure that the presence of his army commander Phichol, who represented all the military, would make the vow one that had been made <b><span class=\"font1\">על דעת רבים</span></b>, \"with the consent of many,\" not merely \"in the presence of many.\"",
                    "The same two rabbis who disagreed in <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 64,9 on the meaning of <span class=\"font1\">ואחוזת מרעהו</span> also disagree on the meaning of the word <span class=\"font1\">פיכל</span>. Rabbi Yehudah considers the word as merely his name, whereas Rabbi Nechemyah sees in it a description of his function, i.e. that <span class=\"font1\">פי כל</span>, he was the authority to whom all the soldiers owed obeisance. The argument between the two rabbis may have the same root, i.e. whether in order to make a vow into a public vow one requires the presence of three or ten people respectively. The plain meaning of the Torah seems to be that three people suffice; this is why if we accept the meaning of Rabbi Yehudah, Avimelech took two people along for the ceremony. According to the view that a quorum of ten is required to make the vow a public oath we would have to interpret the verse according to the opinion of Rabbi Nechemyah in which case Avimelech took along quite a number of people, i.e. a minimum of ten. At the same time Avimelech may have wanted the oath to qualify as <b>approved</b> by a quorum of at least ten people, as we described earlier."

                    "<b> <span class=\"font1\">ויאמר אליהם יצחק</span>, Issac said to them, etc.</b> We have to understand why Isaac spoke to the king and his entourage in such a hostile manner. It seems incompatible with our image of Isaac. Besides, seeing that in the end he did make a covenant with them, what was the point of the hostile attitude Isaac displayed initially? Furthermore, once Isaac had told Avimelech and company that they hated him, why did he spell out how this hatred had expressed itself, i.e. by his being expelled from Gerar? If the latter sentence was meant to prove the Philistines' hatred of him, he should have said <span class=\"font1\">כישלחתם אותי</span>, <b>when</b> you expelled me instead of <span class=\"font1\">ותשלחוני מאתכם</span>, suggesting that they let him go unmolested?",
                    "We must understand Isaac's words as reflecting his awareness that the <b>only reason</b> Avimelech displayed any interest in making an agreement with Isaac was his concern that possibly his own inheritance would be in jeopardy due to G'd's promise to Abraham of the whole land of Canaan. Abraham had already reassured Avimelech about those concerns and Isaac his son would certainly not be able to annul a promise made by his father. There was therefore no reason for Avimelech to approach Isaac in this matter. Isaac reasoned as Maimonides rules that vows undertaken with the consent of the other party cannot be revoked except with that party's consent. Since Abraham had not done so during his lifetime it was too late for Isaac to make any changes, anyways (based on Job 37,18). Under the circumstances Avimelech had no need of Isaac at all. When Isaac said: \"why did you come?\" this is not to be understood as a hostile statement, but as pointing out that there was no need for them to come all the way in order to request what they were about to ask. Seeing this was so, he could only assume that they had come for his sake, presumably in order to lure him back to Gerar. He alluded to this by using the word <span class=\"font1\">אלי</span>, to me. This was hard to believe, however, in view of past hostility shown him. He added the word <span class=\"font1\">ואתם</span>, <b>and you,</b> referring to Avimelech and his ministers personally; he meant that it was not just the population at large which had displayed hatred towards him. By using the word <span class=\"font1\">ותשלחוני</span>, Isaac meant that their hatred of him was based on jealousy. It is a well known fact that hatred may evaporate unless it is caused by jealousy. Hatred based on jealousy will not abate until the cause (Isaac) of the jealousy has disappeared. Isaac challenged Avimelech that their hatred of him would not disappear as it was based on jealousy."

As to the covenant concluded between Abraham and Avimelech they said: \"we have seen,seen.\" They claimed that there were two reasons why they could not rely on Abraham's vow. One was, as we stated, that Abraham's vow was made in private, the other that Abraham had not been a beneficiary of Avimelech and thus was at liberty to annul his vow even without Avimelech's presence or consent. Furthermore, they said that they did realise that only when they renewed said covenant with Isaac would he consider his father's vow as binding and ironclad. Avimelech added that when he concluded his covenant with Abraham he had not been careful to do it in such a way that it would remain irrevocable.",

Although Isaac had pointed out that the fact they had expelled him was a sign of their hatred for him, they had convinced themselves that if he was worthy of G'd's blessing there was no cause to hate him.",
                    "Concerning Isaac's complaint that they had not been honest with him and that it was an effrontery therefore to ask him for favours, <span class=\"font1\">ראו ראינו</span>, they felt intellectually that the permanent validity of the covenant with Abraham would be guaranteed only if they renewed it at this time. I shall forthwith explain how we can read all this out of their carefully chosen words.",
                    "<b><span class=\"font1\">ונאמר תהי נא אלה בינינו</span>, we said: \"let there be an oath between us, etc.\"</b> The word <span class=\"font1\">ונאמר</span> is past tense. They now began to explain the reason they had expelled Isaac from Gerar; as long as Isaac remained with them in Gerar it was legally impossible for the oath they had in mind to become irrevocable. We learn in <i>Nedarim</i> 27 that it is permissible to revoke certain vows without the need to appear before a tribunal. Examples are vows which were made under pressure from people who are reputed to commit murder in order to enrich themselves, or when facing robbers intent merely on confiscating one's property, or when facing tax collectors who exceed their authority. The school of Hillel taught that even when such vows were phrased as an oath, no legal mechanism is required to revoke them (when the danger is over). Concerning the above <i>Mishnah, Maha'rik</i> writes in <i>Yore De-ah</i> 232, that \"anyone who swears an oath or makes a vow under duresss, such oath or vow is not legally binding.\" It suffices to annul such vows or oaths in one's heart; Joseph, however, did not annul his vow concerning his promise to Pharaoh not to reveal that the latter did not understand the Hebrew language, nor did Zedekiah annul his promise to Nebuchadnezzar in his heart. This ruling is valid even if the person who made the vow had been compensated in some form for the vow he was about to make. Avimelech and his company were afraid that Isaac might invoke this ruling to free himself of any vow if such an undertaking were to be made while he was in Avimelech's territory, i.e. under his rule, and therefore under some kind of duress. Therefore they came to a place over which Avimelech had no authority so that any undertaking by Isaac would be completely voluntary and therefore binding upon him. This is also clear from the writings of Nachmanides on the subject. The words <span class=\"font1\">תהי נא</span> were meant to emphasise that the covenant to be undertaken now was to be different from the one previous in that it would <b>remain</b> valid, i.e. <b><span class=\"font1\">תהי</span></b>. When they claimed at the time they expelled Isaac that he had become too powerful, this had only been a pretext to make him leave; their true reason had been to create a situation in which Isaac's oath would be binding upon him. They may also have used that pretext so that Isaac could not try to dissuade them by telling them that their fears that he would not honour his commitment were unfounded. There were some other considerations which I will come back to later.",
                    "<b><span class=\"font1\">בינותינו בינינו ובינך</span>, \"between us, i.e. between us and you.\"</b> The reason they added the apparently unnecessary word <span class=\"font1\">בינותינו</span> was to reinforce the existing agreement concluded with Abraham, and to add a new covenant with Isaac. They wanted to examine whether Isaac considered the agreement with Abraham as valid for him. Perhaps Avimelech was afraid that G'd would renew His promise to give the land of Palestine to Isaac and the latter would give part of his inheritance to Esau. Avimelech did not consider Esau as the seed of Abraham seeing that G'd had specificaly said to Abraham that <span class=\"font1\">כי ביצחק יקרא לך זרע</span>, that <b>only part</b> of Isaac's seed would be considered Abraham's seed (21,12). Should Isaac then decide to give the land of the Philistines to Esau, he, Avimelech, would not have a legal leg to stand on in a dispute with Isaac, seeing that the covenant with Abraham which covered Abraham's descendants down to his great-grandchildren would not have been breached thereby. Esau would argue that his inheritance was due to a promise made by G'd to his father Isaac, not through a promise made by G'd to Abraham who had delayed it from becoming effective for four generations. These were the considerations which prompted Avimelech to make Isaac swear a separate oath. According to Rashi the word <span class=\"font1\">בינותינו</span> alluded to the validity of the agreement for several generations.",
                    "This word may also allude to the fact that Avimelech wanted the undertaking to be a public one. The repetition of the word <span class=\"font1\">בינינו</span> was meant to emphasise the mutual agreement that prevailed at the time of the new covenant and which would make any future attempt to revoke it subject to mutual agreement."

                    "<b> <span class=\"font1\">אם תעשה עמנו</span>, \"if you will do with us, etc.\"</b> They were careful to include in the wording of the covenant that it was in recognition of favours they had done to Isaac, whereas they referred to the eventuality that Isaac might reciprocate by doing harm to them. This is the reason that the whole verse is worded so unusually, as if it had been interrupted in the middle. The words \"if you will do evil with us\" should by rights have been part of the previous verse, providing the rationale for Avimelech seeking this agreement.",
                    "When you keep in mind what we have said, it becomes clear that the words are in their proper place, however. Avimelech and company stressed that just as they had not done any harm to Isaac in the past they now expected him to swear that he in turn would not do something that would harm them in the future. Isaac could not be expected to understand what they meant by the <span class=\"font1\">טוב</span>, the good they had done for him, until they explained that the very fact that they let him depart whole in body and assets was in itself an act of kindness. Kings, i.e. governments, sometimes pass legislation to extend financial aid to some of their subjects. They do so for one of two reasons. 1) If the day would come when the government is in need of financial aid they would have wealthy citizens to call upon to provide loans to the government. 2) In order to enhance the economic standing of their countries. A country which contains many wealthy people thereby adds to the glory of its rulers. As a result one could have argued that any favours Avimelech had done for Isaac were not of an altruistic nature but were designed to enhance the king's personal reputation as a ruler over a successful country. Avimelech denied such an interpretation of his motives by saying: \"just as we never harmed you,\" meaning that there were <b>no</b> selfish motives in <b>that</b> part of the <span class=\"font1\">טוב</span> they had done for Isaac. The very fact they had let Isaac depart with all his assets intact [and had not imposed an emigration tax Ed.] had made Avimelech's country poorer. According to their reasoning this proved that every kindness they had shown Isaac had been genuine, not self-interest. All of this was alluded to in the words <span class=\"font1\">ראו ראינו</span>.",

Previously it could have been argued that he was the beneficiary of the help of G'd extended by means of intermediaries such as the local government in Gerar, i.e. Avimelech himself. Now that he lived in no-man's land it was clear that his success was due entirely to G'd's <b>direct</b> help. ",
                    "Avimelech also wanted to deny the argument that <b>they</b> had caused Isaac's good fortune to be interrupted by their expulsion; this could not have been the case seeing that G'd had been its author. The fact that he was still better off today than when he resided amongst them was the proof; <span class=\"font1\">עתה ברוך ה'</span>, \"now that they had already done all that was in their power with the means at their disposal, it was clear that he was blessed by the Lord\" since he had found the real source of such blessing. All these arguments were designed to elicit an oath the legality of which would be unassailable under any circumstances. There is a discussion in <i>Gittin</i> 46 why the Jewish people did not make war against the Gibeonites when they found out that the latter had tricked them into a promise to treat them as allies instead of as Canaanites (Joshua 9,18). Rabbi Yehudah holds that since the oath was sworn by the leaders of the Jewish people, Israel could not take action denying the validity of that oath. The other rabbis disagree, claiming that the Israelites' undertaking was never valid as it had been based on the Gibeonites' declaration that they were a people who lived far from the land of Canaan. Clearly, Rabbi Yehudah was concerned with the image of Jewish leaders who by defaulting on an undertaking denigrate the reputation of G'd whom they represent. Rashi explains that Rabbi Yehudah's point <b>is not</b> that the oath was valid, but that the Gentiles must not be allowed to say that Jewish leaders were guilty of perjury. We must remember that Rabbi Yehudah's point is not a legal one, i.e. a Mosaic law, but an act of piety that Jewish leaders have to impose upon themselves. Besides, even according to Rabbi Yehudah, such a consideration is in place only when the oath was as public as that of the Jewish people to the Gibeonites. Oaths between a relatively small group of people such as Isaac and Avimelech's entourage would certainly not fall under that heading.",
                    "Furthermore, an additional reason why the other rabbis disagreed with Rabbi Yehudah is that the Gentiles are well aware of the mechanics and the conditions when oaths are subject to annulment. This being so, the question of <span class=\"font1\">חלול השם</span>, public desecration of G'd's name which troubled Rabbi Yehudah did not even arise."

Rebeccah testified that this rule did not apply in her case, that her deeds proved that she had no affinity for Esau. Her womb was indeed blessed, and the good part (Jacob) represented that which was normal, hence her love for Jacob. The Torah teaches us this by repeatedly describing Jacob as Rebeccah's son even in instances where these additional words are otherwise quite superfluous (compare verses 6,8,11,13,15,17,42).

Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai is quoted in the Zohar (Sullam edition <i>Chayey Sarah</i> 251) as explaining that the reason the Torah describes Isaac as loving his wife Rebeccah, something that is natural and does not require special mention, is that the love of the male for the female is rooted in the \"left\" side of the emanations. in Isaac's case it was the fire of the <span class=\"font1\">גבורה</span>, his predominant characteristic which stems from the \"left side\" of the emanations.. If the holiness of the two was tainted in any way this was due more to Isaac than to Rebeccah.

                    "Actually, the Torah found it necessary to explain why Isaac would send a pious son to a person such as Laban, seeing the latter was known to be wicked. True, Abraham had despatched Eliezer to take a wife for Isaac from the house of Bethuel; however, Bethuel was not a well known <span class=\"font1\">רשע</span>, an evil person such as Laban. Besides, Abraham had never told Eliezer in so many words to go to the house of Bethuel whereas he had named Laban specifically as Jacob's destination. He instructed him to marry a daughter of the wicked Laban. By repeating that Laban was after all a brother of the pious Rebeccah the Torah alerts us to the probability that one or both of Laban's daughters could be just as pious as Rebeccah who stemmed from the house of Bethuel. One must not assume that the children and grandchildren of a wicked father or grandfather will automatically turn out to be of evil character. The Torah hints at this by reminding us that even Rebeccah was the mother of both a pious person such as Jacob and an evil person such as Esau.",
                    "You have to appreciate that in the period under discussion [prior to the revelation at Mount Sinai in which all the holy souls participated Ed.] the holy souls had not yet been separated from the regions in which they were imprisoned. Seeing that Abraham's family was recognised as a region where holiness had found a foothold, both he and Sarah being the first proselytes, anyone who would subsequently convert to Judaism would be called either Abraham if a male or Sarah if a female. It is a fact that holy members of a holy species look for other members of the same species. Abraham was still incomplete in this regard as neither he nor his son Isaac had as yet produced female offspring, i.e. holy female souls. Perhaps this is even the reason that we are told in Genesis 25,19: \"Abraham begat Isaac,\" to remind us that he had succeeded only in producing a holy male soul. This situation still existed when Isaac sent out Jacob to secure a wife. The holy female souls had not yet been separated from their place of imprisonment. Isaac therefore had to send Jacob to search for his lost mate, i.e. the girl in whose body such a holy soul was imprisoned.",
                    "It was only during subsequent generations that Jews were no longer forced to roam the world to find their mates amongst the Gentiles. If nonetheless some \"sparks\" of holiness (holy souls in captivity) still exist amongst the Gentiles they will eventually convert and then be recognised as holy souls returning to their home (the Jewish people).",
                    "This raises the question of Abraham's insistence that Isaac not marry someone of Canaanite descent. Isaac also instructed Jacob not to marry a Canaanite. <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> explains this prohibition to marry girls of Canaanite descent as being due to that tribe being cursed whereas Abraham's seed was blessed. Actually the words of the <i>Midrash</i> are somewhat obscure. In light of what we have written Abraham may have meant that Canaan [Noach's grandson] had been denied holy female souls amongst his seed as a result of Noach's curse. Hence there was no chance of finding the girl who possessed a holy soul amongst that tribe. This is the deeper meaning of Noach's curse, i.e. that Canaan would be denied access to holiness.",
                    "Whereas it is a fact that even nowadays we still experience conversions to Judaism amongst the Gentiles, it is remarkable that we have no record of members of the Canaanites ever converting to Judaism as did some Romans and other nationals, for instance. This proves our theory. This may also have been the real reason that the Torah commanded the Jewish people not to allow a single Canaanite soul to survive [in the campaign to capture the land of Israel] as we know from Deuteronomy 20,16. The Torah may have stressed the word \"soul\" in that verse to indicate that none of these people had a holy soul worth preserving. This was the difference between the Canaanites and nations such as Ammon and Moab.",
                    "Since G'd has revealed all this to us we must try and understand what purpose our subjugation by Canaanite tribes served (compare Judges 4,2), seeing that the purpose of exile is to extract the sparks of holiness that are scattered amongst the Gentiles, and there are no such \"sparks\" amongst the Canaanites. Our sages have told us in <i>Pessachim</i> 119 that \"our forefathers did not depart from Egypt until they had turned Egypt into a trap that did not contain any bait and into a deep pool of water devoid of fish.\" The scriptural proof cited is Exodus 12,36: \"they emptied Egypt.\" The <i>Ari zal</i> in his <span class=\"font1\">שער הגלגולים</span> explains that it was necessary to empty Egypt of any such stray holy souls to make a return by the Jewish people in the future pointless.  In view of all this, what purpose could subjugation of the Jewish people by the Canaanites have served if there was not even a chance to save some stray holy soul through all our suffering?",
                    "We find in <span class=\"font1\">לקוטי תורה פרשת מקץ</span> that there are two different \"sparks\" of holy souls which are imprisoned in the <span class=\"font1\">קליפה</span>. One is the type of soul which is freed through being \"born,\" i.e. through entering a human body at birth. Examples of such souls are: Abraham, Sarah, Rebeccah, Rachel, as well as the soul of Rabbi Chaninah ben Tradyon which emanated from Shechem's having slept with Jacob's daughter Dinah. Ruth the Moabite and Naamon the Ammonite are also examples of such souls. The other type of holy soul imprisoned in the <span class=\"font1\">קליפה</span> is one that is firmly attached to its <span class=\"font1\">קליפה</span> and is not capable of exiting from its source unless its <span class=\"font1\">קליפה</span> causes anguish to Israel. When that happens the holy soul trapped within the <span class=\"font1\">קליפה</span> is released and able to return to its origin. Now we understand why there is a purpose to Israel being subjected to exile at the hands of such people [representatives of such <span class=\"font1\">קליפות</span> Ed.]. The prophet Ovadiah said concerning such an exile: \"This sickening exile for the children of Israel under the Canaanites as far as Tzorfat (Ovadiah 1,20).\" This verse which uses the term <span class=\"font1\">החל</span> must then be understood similarly to Daniel 8,27: <span class=\"font1\">נהייתי ונחליתי</span>, \"I was broken up and I was sick.\" Such an exile achieves its objective in a manner different from all other exiles of the Jewish people. When Ovadiah speaks of <span class=\"font1\">כנענים</span> instead of <span class=\"font1\">בכנענים</span> when describing that exile, as well as describing Canaan in the plural instead of in the singular as is the case with other nations where Israel was exiled, this may be a veiled reference to the \"sparks\" of holiness still hidden within the <span class=\"font1\">קליפה</span> of Canaan which are known as <span class=\"font1\">כנענים</span>. In short, Ovadiah describes the purpose of that exile as being the chance of \"rescuing\" holy souls that were still identified with <span class=\"font1\">כנענים</span> prior to the ultimate redemption, thus enabling those souls to participate in that redemption."

This scenario may have been re-enacted when the descendants of Esau (Amalek) attacked the Israelites after the latter had crossed the sea of reeds.

I have already explained in chapter 16,21 that there was never a question of Ishmael sharing in Abraham's inheritance since Ishmael was legally a slave and as such could not inherit anything from anybody.

Although the expression <span class=\"font1\">זרע</span> does not imply that such seed must be morally fit in order to qualify for that description and therefore for the right to inherit, the fact that all the blessings of Abraham were transferred to Jacob excludes Esau as an heir.

The proof of all this is that when man sleeps he subsequently awakens by moving his sleeping body; if the entire soul had previously departed from him he would not be able to experience these motions of his body. The picture drawn for us by the Torah therefore is that of a sleeping person who is not detached from either heaven or earth but remains in contact with both.

Acording to <i>Shemot Rabbah</i> 1,33 Yitro made a similar condition when he gave his daughter Tzipporah to Moses. Laban had no need to make Jacob take an oath since the matters he and Laban had discussed could be acquired legally by an exchange of words.

The above mentioned thoughts all crossed Laban's mind to be used in the event that he would later on have a disagreement with Jacob. This is why G'd warned him in Genesis 31,24 not to speak to Jacob.

If someone declares to his bride to-be: \"you are betrothed to me in exchange for certain work I shall perform for you and he performs this work, this is not a valid form of betrothal since the compensation the bride receives (the work) is considered as a loan only, and one cannot acquire a bride by means of a loan.\" This is why Jacob said: <span class=\"font1\">הבה</span>, \"hand over!\" Up until he had completed the work contracted for, Rachel had not even been his betrothed. Jacob was aware that he had not acquired Rachel by means of the value of the work he performed for Laban. As a result he could acquire her only by means of having physical relations with her. He therefore had to ask Laban to make this possible by handing her over, i.e. <span class=\"font1\">ואבא אליה</span>.",

Concerning the laws of purchase of properties or slaves Maimonides writes in <i>Hilchot Mechirah</i> chapter 7 that if one acquires either slaves or real estate by means of a loan such a purchase is valid even if no money changes hand at the time. When Jacob said to Laban <span class=\"font1\">הבה את אשתי</span> he meant that inasmuch as Rachel had already become his wife at the beginning of his servitude because he thought that he had \"bought\" her (in accordance with Maimonides), there was no need for actual money to change hands. The words <span class=\"font1\">הבה לי</span> were not to be understood as the final act in the acquisition of Rachel as a wife, but were to be the prelude to his fulfilling his marital duties with a woman already his wife.

You are well advised to study what the <i>Zohar <span class=\"font1\">סתרי תורה</span> on Parshat Vayetze</i> item 176 has to say on the subject. According to the <i>Zohar</i>, Laban's having switched Leah for Rachel was the cause that the sanctity of the birthright became downgraded. Originally both monarchy and priesthood would have been the share of the firstborn just as the firstborn receives a double portion of the inheritance from his father. When Jacob slept with Leah he intended to impregnate Rachel (since he was not aware of his partner's real identity). This meant that his marital relations with Leah at the time were not totally pure.

He loved both equally and treated them both equally. To prove this, he would not ask a higher price for Rachel than he had been willing to accept for Leah.

From the following verse it appears, however, that Laban also took the ankle-striped ones for himself. Why did he do this?",
                    "It appears that according to the agreement Jacob made he did not want Laban to take the ankle-striped animals. If Laban were to take those Jacob would also have to separate them from the white sheep and he, Jacob, would not be left with white animals which could respond to the stratagem he employed later when the animals were in heat. All his efforts would then have been in vain. It had not occurred to Jacob to deceive Laban in any way whatsoever. He thought that the sight of ankle-striped ones would cause the flocks to become heated and to cause also the speckled and spotted animals to give birth. When you read verse 40 you will find confirmation of what I have said. Crafty Laban was aware of all these implications and took every type, i.e. the <span class=\"font1\">עקוד, נקוד וטלוא</span>. In addition he removed every animal that had some white on its pelt. In this way Jacob's potential wages were reduced to almost nothing. This is why Jacob had to resort to the stratagem with the rods; he therefore also took some of the ankle-striped ones for himself. When Laban removed the mother animals he had thereby proved that he considered them as basically Jacob's (the new generation). Proverbs 5,22: \"he will be caught in the ropes of his sin\" is applicable to what Laban tried to do in this paragraph."

Unless that category was also part of the original agreement between Laban and Jacob, why did the angel show Jacob that category in his dream?",
                    "I have seen an explanation by Ibn Ezra (30,39) who identifies the <span class=\"font1\">ברודים</span> with the <span class=\"font1\">טלואים</span>. He does not offer any proof for his contention. Furthermore, from a close look at Jacob citing such examples as: <span class=\"font1\">אם כה יאמר עקודים יהיה שכרך</span>, it is clear that Jacob took for himself only either <span class=\"font1\">עקודים</span> or <span class=\"font1\">נקודים</span>. Why would he have the ewes mounted by categories of rams which were not his share at all?",
                    "The reason therefore appears to be that Laban was not only a swindler but he also had <span class=\"font1\">תרפים</span>, charms that supposedly revealed to him many hidden things. <i>Midrash Tanchuma</i> describes Laban as consulting these charms which would reveal to him what developed inside the animals' wombs and the appearance of the fetuses [much like what we learn nowadays through the ultrasound examinations Ed.]. In view of this Jacob was stymied every which way through these <span class=\"font1\">תרפים</span>. This is why G'd had to interfere on Jacob's behalf. It is important to appreciate that the skin patterns of the animals to be born was determined at the time they were in heat; these skin patterns were not subject to change afterwards except through miraculous intervention by G'd. Such a miracle was one of upsetting natural laws in a very basic manner. G'd does not ligthly engage in the performance of this kind of miracle. We know this from statements of our sages in <i>Sotah</i> 2 and <i>Shabbat</i> 23. G'd therefore acted with particular adroitness so as not to have to upset the laws of nature unduly. He did this by causing three categories of rams to mount the ewes when they were in heat. As a result each of the female animals contained the sperm of three different types of rams, each potentially fertilising the ewes they had mounted and causing them to have its particular skin pattern. This stymied the power of the charms. The charms could not then reveal to Laban which skin pattern would ultimately result at the time these ewes gave birth. Since Laban and Jacob had agreed that the skin pattern of the animals <b>to be born</b> would determine which belonged to Jacob, Laban did not know in advance what skin pattern would emerge. This matter is not as far-fetched as you may think since we know of certain birds that can change colour in order to adapt themselves to their environment so that it helps camouflage them against predators. G'd simply employed a natural process such as the birds employ for themselves and made it operate with these sheep and goats. When the Torah speaks about <span class=\"font1\">ברודים</span>, it refers to a kind of <span class=\"font1\">טלוא</span> as stated by Rabbi Eleazar ben Azaryah. Perhaps this particular variety of <span class=\"font1\">טלוא</span> contained more white speckles, similar to white pellets of hail (<span class=\"font1\">ברד</span>).",

Perhaps the failure of the earth to \"fold\" was a way of G'd telling Jacob that he did not need to flee, that even if Laban were to catch up with him he would not even be able to speak to him offensively or threateningly.

We have written earlier that villains have a tendency of suspecting others of being guilty of the same crimes they themselves are guilty of.

Ed.], the original owners not being able to reclaim the same animal as compensation. This rule applies even when the owners had not given up hope of retrieving the same animal. Jacob told Laban that even when the circumstances would have been such that he could have legally kept an animal for himself, he did not avail himself of the legality of the matter but acted strictly according to what his conscience dictated to him as being correct moral behaviour. He could have returned lambs to Laban instead of fully grown animals; however he returned fully grown ones if perchance an accident had happened to one of the young animals under his care.

Also, why did he repeat: \"They were <b>my</b> loss, you collected from <b>me</b>?\"",
                    "Jacob pointed out to Laban that he took compensation from him for something that he was legally liable for as well as for losses for which Jacob was not legally liable at all. He spelled out <span class=\"font1\">טרפה</span> as an example of losses due to wolves, and: \"I did not bring you,\" as examples of losses due to attacks by a lion. We find the following statement in <i>Baba Metzia</i> 93: \"When a shepherd or trustee abandons the animals under his care by making a trip to the city, and a lion came and trampled an animal to death, or a wolf came and tore an animal, etc.\" We see that different animals cause death by different methods. A wolf leaves the scene of where he caused harm immediately, whereas the lion kills his prey and remains at that site until he has devoured it. He leaves only the skin and the dung. Similarly, Jacob alluded to these two kinds of predators. He added: <span class=\"font1\">אנכי אחטנה</span>, concerning the fence for which he was responsible. Had there been a single wolf, proper fencing in of the animals would have prevented such an attack; therefore the paid keeper is responsible for such damage (<i>Baba Metzia</i> 72). Jacob referred to the other kind of fence, i.e. one that is trampled on by the lion, something for which the shepherd is not responsible. Laban took no notice of these distinctions and insisted on compensation from Jacob regardless of the cause of the damage he suffered. Rashi must been inspired by the Holy Spirit when he gave this explanation. He had the same thing in mind as we have have just elaborated on.",
                    "When Jacob added: <span class=\"font1\">גנובתי יום וגנובתי לילה</span>, \"regardless of whether it was stolen from me by day or by night,\" he referred to damage incurred through hostile humans; in either case Jacob paid, whether he was legally responsible or not, such as when it was stolen at night."

When Jacob said: <span class=\"font1\">אלוקי אברהם</span>, he meant that it had been Abraham who had spread the fame of that G'd and acquainted mankind with His truth.

In the case of his father Isaac it was the virtue of justice referred to by Jacob as <span class=\"font1\">פחד יצחק</span>, \"the One whom Isaac stood in awe of.\" Jacob refrained from saying <span class=\"font1\">אלוקי יצחק</span> in order to be able to allude to his father's outstanding virtue. We find G'd Himself referring to <span class=\"font1\">אלוקי יצחק</span> in Genesis 28,14.

Although the Torah puts these words in the mouth of the wicked Laban, the Torah teaches us something of legal significance at the same time. This is the lesson that in Jewish law the term \"family\" is determined by the father and not by the mother. We find a similar lesson that the Torah teaches by using Laban as an illustration when the latter espoused the principle of <span class=\"font1\">אין מערבים שמחה בשמחה</span>, that one does not celebrate two joyful events simultaneoulsy. Laban had used this rule when he delayed Jacob's and Rachel's wedding by a week so that Leah could have a full week of wedding celebrations with her husband (compare Jerusalem Talmud <i>Moed Katan</i> chapter 1)."

Although <i>Yevamot</i> 13 states that wherever the letter <span class=\"font1\">ל</span> is required at the beginning it can be substituted for by the letter <span class=\"font1\">ה</span> at the end, this does not explain when the Torah chooses one method rather than another.",
                    "The verse wants to justify the expression \"he sent angels.\" Why did Jacob employ heavenly beings without a pressing need? He could have accomplished the same thing by employing human messengers! The Torah says <span class=\"font1\">לפניו</span>, to tell us that since Jacob had already met with these angels and they had obviously come to help him, he was permitted to use them as messengers for a task that human messengers might prove inadequate for. Jacob reasoned that seeing that these messengers would meet an important man such as Esau, he might not consider messengers of a lower order as appropriate to his stature (compare <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 75). Esau might not have responded to any other messengers at all. It is also possible that Esau would immediately pounce on Jacob's human messengers as the eagle does when he swoops out of the skies, thus not giving him any warning before attacking him. For all these reasons Jacob was justified in employing celestial beings to act as his messengers. Perhaps he also hoped that when Esau became aware that he, Jacob, had celestial beings do his bidding he would desist from his planned attack on Jacob altogether. The <i>Midrash</i> we quoted above refers to those angels as being garbed in \"fiery garments, riding horses of fire, etc.\"",
                    "The reason the Torah mentions the word \"his brother,\" is to emphasize that Jacob despatched the messengers in a spirit of brotherliness and that he accorded Esau the honour due to an older brother. He was afraid of engaging Esau in warfare in case the latter should invoke his father's merits.",
                    "Another approach is also possible. The Torah emphasizes: <span class=\"font1\">אל עשו</span> in order to tell us that on the one hand Esau hated him; on the other hand, the Torah wrote <span class=\"font1\">אל אחיו</span>, to tell us that he did not hate him, that he was his brother. The messengers should be guided in their approach to Esau according to the frame of mind they would find him in. Since only celestial beings could divine Esau's frame of mind with any certainty, Jacob had to send celestial messengers to accomplish this task.",
                    "Still another possibility is that Jacob's strategy was to send messengers to Esau before Esau had a chance to hear about his approach from another source. This is in line with the various <i>Midrashim</i> in which Jacob is criticised severely for not letting sleeping dogs lie, for demeaning himself by repeating so many times \"your servant Jacob,\" etc. He chose to send angels who would not have to exert themselves by excessive travel. To the angels the whole universe appeared no greater than four cubits do to us mortal human beings. When the Torah reports that Jacob sent messengers <b>ahead of him</b> to Esau, the word <span class=\"font1\">לפניו</span>, before him, is an allusion that the angels were still literally in his presence although they performed their mission to Esau who was quite a distance away. The reason that the Torah wrote <span class=\"font1\">ארצה שעיר</span> instead of <span class=\"font1\">לארץ שעיר</span>, is to emphasize that the angels did not actually have to go anywhere. All they had to do was to face in a different direction. The reason that the field is called \"Edom\" is that they would arrive at Esau's, i.e. the field of Edom, before the latter had a chance to even to get under way towards Jacob.",
                    "This verse may also be understood as alluding to three different historical periods during each of which Esau's conduct would be different. One period finds Jacob and Esau in a brotherly relationship. This is alluded to by the words: \"to Esau his brother.\" This period would extend until the destruction of the Holy Temple. Even though there were times prior to that when the Edomites were subjugated by Israel, such periods were relatively brief. During a different period in history, after the destruction of the Holy Temple until the end of the present era (before the advent of the Messiah), Esau would occupy a lofty position on earth and Israel would not even be considered by it as of any importance at all. This is the period which is alluded to here by the words <span class=\"font1\">ארצה שעיר</span>, with the vowel <i>patach</i> under the letter <span class=\"font1\">א</span>. This vowel underlines the superior position of Esau. The third period is the one we are hoping for when Edom will become an inheritance (for the Jewish people).

Otherwise, Esau might form the impression that the messengers related to him with deference and called him \"his master,\" being aware that he was the senior brother and that it was only common courtesy to address him in that fashion, but that Jacob himself had never uttered the word <span class=\"font1\">אדון</span> in relation to his brother.

He did so in order to remove any vestige of hatred and jealousy Esau might still, harbour against him in his heart.

You must appreciate that there are occasions when G'd does show a person kindness whereas that person is subsequently deprived of his gains by outsiders exercising their free will. G'd in turn compensates the person who has suffered such a robbery. In such instances the person in question has experienced partial comfort only. He would have felt much better if he had not been robbed of what G'd had granted him in the first place. He will never forget that he had once become the victim of a robbery. He will imagine that if he had not been robbed he would now be still better off, not realising that G'd had only compensated him for what he had been robbed of. Secondly, the fact that G'd did not interfere with the robber will continue to bother such a person. He would have felt completely at ease had G'd restored to him the very goods the robber had taken. Jacob had experienced this latter kind of personal supervision by G'd as we know from 31,9, where Jacob described how G'd had saved his cattle from Laban and restored them to him.

There were three reasons for this. 1) Dinah was Leah's daughter. Had she been Rachel's daughter she would never have made such an unchaperoned excursion. Her mother Leah had \"gone out\" to meet her husband (30,15), something that was uncharacteristic of Jewish women. <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 80,1 claims that at the time Leah adorned herself with all her jewelry. Her daughter copied her mother, giving the impression that she was a harlot. 2) A second cause for Dinah's excursion was the fact that as an only daughter she had no female playmates; she went in search of suitable company. Inasmuch as she was a daughter of Jacob she had already acquired the reputation of being a distinguished person, something that provoked Shechem as we shall explain later. 3) <span class=\"font1\">לראות בבנות הארץ</span>, \"she went to take a look at the daughters of the land.\" According to <i>Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer</i> chapter 38 Shechem had brought the girls of the neighbourhood to play music around the tent of Jacob.

This shows that they all shared equally in the guilt of kidnapping. The reason the Torah does not speak about these people having \"stolen\" their sister is that the principal sin they were guilty of was that it was the kind of robbery which could not be made good. [If you kidnap a virgin and you give back a woman who has been defiled by sexual intercourse out of wedlock this is not a proper restoration. Ed.] The Torah makes it plain by using the term \"they had defiled,\" that if the sin had not been one that could not be reversed the brothers would not have killed all the males in the town. While it is certainly true that the people of Shechem were not the only ones in the world guilty of such crimes, and Noachides who have committed robbery are all guilty of the death penalty, the brothers could certainly not be expected to play executioners in all such instances. They lacked the power to do so. Jacob himself alluded to this when he accused Shimon and Levi as \"distressing\" him, especially in view of the fact that his family was \"numerically weak\" (verse 30).",
                    "Another reason why the Torah speaks of \"who had defiled\" is to justify the brothers looting the belongings of the inhabitants of Shechem. Their property served as <span class=\"font1\">דמי בושת</span>, compensation for the humiliation Dinah had suffered at the hands of these people. The amount of such compensation is determined in accordance with the relative stature of the victim as well as the perpetrator of the crime. In this instance both Shechem and Dinah were of very elevated stature so that the compensation due was of the highest category. The entire possessions of the townspeople may not have sufficed to provide adequate compensation for the shame Dinah had suffered. She was a person who was unique in the whole world. When I mentioned earlier that a self-confessed sinner is free from financial penalties, this does not apply to the money paid as compensation for shaming someone (<i>Ketuvot</i> 41).",
                    "In his <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> chapter 9,14, Maimonides explains that the reason all the inhabitants of Shechem were guilty of death was that they had failed to establish a judiciary which would deal with the robbery committed by Shechem. Whence does Maimonides know that the common people had to judge their king or crown prince? Is it not a fact that even amongst the Israelites individuals do not have to testify against the King, and one does not sit in judgment of him (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 16)? Accordingly, we are forced to conclude that the guilt of the people of Shechem consisted in their being <b>active</b> accessories to the crime. They may even have advised Shechem how to successfully rape Dinah. Nachmanides refutes Maimonides' argument claiming that the Noachides were not commanded to establish a permanent judiciary but to settle matters that come up for litigation. He claims that the death of the people of Shechem was primarily for the sin of idolatry which all of them had been guilty of for a long time. His words require proof, and they do not account for the brothers looting the town."

Once the idol has become the possession of a Jew, the only way it can be neutralised is by utterly destroying it. The Talmud distinguishes between adult Gentiles and children, however. The reason Jacob or the brothers did not force the surviving women of Shechem to neutralise these gods may have been that those women were halachically in the same category as children, i.e. that their actions had no validity in law. It is also possible that the sons of Jacob had simply not been careful to differentiate between different kinds of the loot. When they examined it at home it was already too late to do anything about neutralising these objects and making them usable for a Jew. Some of these idols may even have been hidden within other larger vessels which the sons of Jacob had captured. Another possibility is that the gods which had been neutralised in time somehow became mixed with others which had not. ",
                    "Jacob instructed the members of his household to purify themselves because contact with idols defiles a person. Maimonides writes in <i>Hilchot Avot Ha-Tumah</i> chapter six that any <span class=\"font1\">אב הטומאה</span>, source of serious impurity, which confers impurity through touch or through carrying same, not only confers impurity on any person who touches same but also on anyone touching or carrying objects that have been in touch with the person who is <span class=\"font1\">אב הטומאה</span>. Accordingly, Jacob was quite right when he instructed his people to purify themselves and their clothing even if not they personally, but only their clothing had been in contact with the idolatrous trinket. Jacob was also very precise in referring to <span class=\"font1\">שמלותיכם</span>, your garments. He meant that the garments worn by the people of Shechem at the time they were slain had to be purified also. ",
                    "You may ask that there should have been no need to change clothing seeing that clothing could have become defiled only through direct contact with the idolatrous object, an <span class=\"font1\">אב הטומאה</span>, and even if these garments had been in direct contact with the idolatrous object they could not have conferred impurity on a human being seeing they themselves were not primary sources of impurity. When we read in Psalms 106,28: <span class=\"font1\">ויאכלו מזבחי מתים</span>, \"they ate sacrifices offered to the dead,\" the word \"dead\" is understood to be a reference to idolatry. Idolatry and the dead are equated halachically for the purpose of the transference of impurity. <i>Chulin</i> 3 states that the sword of a slain person is of the <b>same</b> degree of impurity as the person who has been slain with it. [normally it would be of a lesser degree, seeing it is not the original source of that impurity, Ed.] According to Maimonides <i>Hilchot Tum-at met</i> chapter chapter 5 the example of \"sword\" is applicable to any of the objects that were attached to the slain person at the time he died, including his garments. According to the foregoing the garments of the people of Shechem then were capable of transferring impurity to human beings just as the sword which kills a person."

Although our rabbis in the Talmud there point out that the Torah itself refers to Israel as Jacob after G'd renamed him, in view of the fact that we ignore the words <span class=\"font1\">לא יקרא</span> when it comes to Jacob, why should the same rule not apply to Abraham and we should have the choice of calling him by either name?

                    "Perhaps the very fact that G'd limited the good news when He renamed Jacob by saying: \"your name is Jacob,\" made this change of name qualitatively different from that of Abraham at the time. There had been no need for G'd to repeat \"your name is Jacob.\" Who did not know this? Surely what G'd meant by this was that Jacob's permanent name would remain Jacob, but that on some occasions he would be referred to by an additional name, i.e. Israel. Why would it bother G'd that we should not refer to Abraham's original name? I believe there is a very good reason. We have to remember that names describe the nature of its bearers' souls, their essence. The Talmud <i>Berachot</i> 7 illustrates this point. Jacob's essence then is described by the name Jacob. Whenever he enjoyed a large measure of Holy Spirit he was referred to as \"Israel.\" There is certainly no reason why Jacob should be deprived of his original name on account of an occasional infusion of <span class=\"font1\">רוח הקודש</span>. It was quite different in the case of Abraham who retained all the letters of his original name in his expanded name also. This is why G'd commanded to call him only by his new and expanded name Abraham. By doing so one did not deny his original name at all. Perhaps Chronicles I,1 26 refers to this when it states: \"Abram is Abraham.\" When the Torah said: \"your name shall not be called, etc,\" the meaning is that it should not be called exclusively Jacob but also Israel. This is exactly parallel to Genesis 17,5 where Abraham's name was changed."

Had we not been informed here that Joseph was seventeen at the time he had these dreams we would not have known that rule.",

The evil urge is not as strong in a person who is sixteen as it is in a person who is seventeen years of age. By telling us Joseph's age when the sale occurred we know that his evil urge was very active within him at that time. This may have accounted for his provocative conduct towards his brothers and the fact that he engaged in tale-bearing.",

We would have expected: <span class=\"font1\">היה רעה הצאן את אחיו</span>. Besides, why did the Torah add the words: \"he was a lad,\" when we are told his age in the same breath? <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 84,7 explains this by saying that Joseph indulged in childish activities. If that were true why would he do so only with the children of Bilhah? Rashi explains that he felt at home in the environment of Bilhah who had been the handmaid of his mother. This is even more far-fetched; why did the Torah mention <span class=\"font1\">נשי אביו</span>, \"his father's <b>wives</b>? We must also know what precisely the <span class=\"font1\">רבתם רעה</span>, the evil reports about the brothers which Joseph brought to his father consisted of? The Torah is not intended to complicate an issue by speaking in riddles but to help us understand it! We believe therefore that the Torah wanted us to know that this is what happened. ",
                    "The words <span class=\"font1\">היה רעה את אחיו בצאן</span> refer to the sheep the brothers were accused of eating. The words <span class=\"font1\">והוא נער</span> refer to Joseph's earlier childhood during which he had spent much time with the sons of Bilhah. The reason the Torah mentions <span class=\"font1\">נשי אביו</span> is to tell us that Joseph did not discriminate against the sons of the handmaidens but related to their mothers as \"his father's <b>wives</b>.\" This is especially mentioned as only Joseph treated Bilhah and Zilpah as wives of Jacob in the full sense of the word. According to the <i>Midrash</i> there Joseph suspected his brothers of eating parts of the sheep while the animal was still alive. The Torah disproved this suspicion later when it reported that the brothers even <b>slaughtered</b> an animal, which they were presumably not going to eat, before they dipped Joseph's tunic in its blood. [I suppose the author feels that the word <span class=\"font1\">רעה</span>, tending, could also be read as <span class=\"font1\">רעה</span>, evil, to account for this allusion to Joseph's suspicions of his brothers. Ed.] Joseph's suspecting his brothers of immoral behaviour may have stemmed from their viewing the handmaidens as merely slaves and their belittling the sons of the handmaidens. When Joseph observed how the brothers belittled their half-brothers this may have caused him to begin to belittle the sons of Leah instead. The author discusses the halachic aspects of the issue of someone who sleeps with a handmaid, concluding that at any rate someone of the stature of Jacob would certainly do so only in order to raise the woman in question to a higher status, and the children would automatically be free men.",
                    "The problem with all the above speculations in the <i>Midrash</i> is why, if four of the brothers were treated as inferior, all of them voted against Joseph and agreed to sell him? Perhaps it was because Joseph had included them in the suspicions about their eating habits which he had related to his father. Alternatively, these four brothers exploited that opportunity to gain favour with the sons of Leah although they themselves harboured no ill feelings against Joseph."

It was the additional element of their father displaying distinct favoritism which poisoned the atmosphere between Joseph and his brothers. Not only did Jacob love Joseph better than all his other sons <b>combined</b>, but he even made a public display of this. Once this hatred of Joseph had become a factor in their mutual relations nothing could correct the situation.

The reader is referred to an excellent analysis of this statement by Rabbi Yitzchak Arama in chapter 29 of his <i>Akeydat Yitzchak,</i> see my translation page 247, second edition. Ed.] The rabbis also say that one should enquire from someone who is well disposed towards him when searching for the meaning of one's dream (<i>Rosh</i> on that paragraph). Joseph hoped that by telling the brothers of his dreams they would themselves find an acceptable and plausible explanation which would put their minds at ease. At least they would realise that Joseph had no ambition to become king over them. Why else would he be silly enough to provoke their hatred by telling them about his dreams?

If the latter, why mention the existence of such a dream? If to tell us that the brothers hated him even more, this too has already been adequately explained.

Any delay might result in the dream not being fulfilled. He may also have wanted to prove to them that he had not told any of his friends about this dream expecting them to give him a positive interpretation, but had instead come to his brothers first. Had he first told his friends of his dream the brothers would not have believed that he wanted to convince them that he wanted to be on good terms with them. According to <i>Berachot</i> 55 Rabbi Banah once told his dream to 24 different interpreters and received 24 different interpretations, each one of which proved correct. It is possible that this was so because none contradicted any of the other interpretations. When contradictory interpretations are received the more recent interpretation cannot cancel out a previous one. Joseph may have wanted to convince the brothers of his <span class=\"font1\">תמימות</span>, his sincerity, by offering them a chance to come up with a negative interpretation of his dream which his friends could not later on nullify.

When these conditions are met, he may consider the dream as a prophetic revelation. Dreams that young people dream are often blurred or contain unlikely and exaggerated occurrences.

This dream could have been interpreted in two ways. 1) It could presage that Joseph would become an actual physical ruler i.e. <span class=\"font1\">מלך</span>; 2) it could presage merely <span class=\"font1\">ממשלה</span>. The interpretation that Joseph would become an actual ruler was an interpretation that allowed for some doubt, whereas the interpretation that he would become a <span class=\"font1\">משל</span>, a highly placed administrator, seemed absolutely certain. This is why they answered him in accordance with either of these possibilities. Concerning the possibility of his becoming an actual ruler they asked: <span class=\"font1\">המלך תמלך עלינו</span>? \"Are you really considering the possibility of becoming king over us?\" Concerning the definite prediction that he would become a highly placed administrator, they asked <span class=\"font1\">אם משל תמשל בנו</span>, \"are you going to be administrator over us? Onkelos has referred to this distinction when he rendered the first <span class=\"font1\">המלך</span> as <span class=\"font1\">את מדמי</span> \"do you imagine, etc?\" whereas he renders the word <span class=\"font1\">אם משל</span> as <span class=\"font1\">את סביר</span>, do you think, etc?\" The brothers repeated the words because they were amazed at two aspects of the interpretation. 1) Do you think you will become king at all? 2) Do you think your authority as king will also extend over us? The reason for their incredulity was the fact that they had a tradition that Yehudah would become king over all of them. How could Joseph's vision uproot such a tradition?",

He based himself on the following discussion in <i>Pesachim</i> 8. We are taught in a Baraita: When there is a hole in a wall dividing the property of a Jew from that of a Gentile, one needs to search for possible <i>chametz</i> as far as one's arm can reach. Plymo says that one does not have to endanger oneself in order to locate such <i>chametz.</i> The Talmud counters that Rabbi Eleazar has said that when one is engaged in the performance of a <span class=\"font1\">מצוה</span> one is not liable to suffer harm. So why should considerations of danger prevent someone from searching for <i>chametz?</i> The Talmud answers that the rule of Rabbi Eleazar holds true only where danger is not likely to be encountered. The other rabbis who disagree with Plymo hold that the two situations are not alike. When danger is apparent, such as certain hornets having their lairs inside the holes of a wall, one endangers one's life frivolously by putting in one's arm searching for <i>chametz.</i> When the danger consists of the Gentile possibly accusing the Jew of engaging in sorcery because he performs an act such as looking for <i>chametz,</i> something that seems non-sensical to the Gentile this is no reason to desist and to rely on miracles instead. The Talmud cites the incident of Samuel enquiring of G'd how he could endanger himself carying out his command to anoint David when there was a price on David's head? G'd told him to pretend to go to Hebron to slaughter an animal for G'd (Samuel I 16,2). Samuel was in very real danger, as the chances that king Saul would hear about his trip to Hebron were close to 100% and he would be very suspect. Such danger could not be compared with that of searching for <i>chametz</i> in a wall and the Gentile neighbour jumping to the wrong conclusion. Joseph's brothers had never been suspected of planning to actually harm him physically. Plymo might also not have considered Joseph's danger at the hands of his brothers as real enough for him not to rely on Rabbi Eleazar's dictum that the performance of the <span class=\"font1\">מצוה</span> would act as his shield.",

When Joseph went to Shechem and failed to find the brothers his mission was completed. If he decided nonetheless to go to Dothan to locate them there he was no longer his father's messenger. This is why he was no longer protected by performing a commandment of his father. Jacob was convinced that no harm would befall Joseph at Shechem.

He merely understood that his brothers had not only left Shechem but the whole district. The reason the \"man\" added \"I have heard the brothers say: 'let us go to Dothan,' was to explain what he meant by \"they have moved from here.'\" He could not say with certainty that the brothers had actually arrived at Dothan.

It did not occur to Joseph that the man with whom he talked was an angel; therefore he did not try to read any more into the man's words than appeared obvious.

Joseph had accused his brothers of eating <span class=\"font1\">אבר מן החי</span>, tissue from a living animal. A fitting penalty would be for Joseph himself to be consumed by wild animals before he was dead. Joseph had also claimed that the brothers engaged in sex with partners forbidden to them. All these accusations, if true, carry the death penalty when committed by Gentiles. Moreover, a Gentile may be convicted by the testimony of a single witness without corroboration and without the victim having been warned of the consequences of his behaviour. Even next of kin may testify against the accused (Maimonides <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> chapter 9). Accordingly, the brothers applied to Joseph the law of an <span class=\"font1\">עד זומם</span> thus exonerating themselves in the eyes of heaven. However, if so, they would not be considered innocent before a human tribunal because they had no <span class=\"font1\">הזמה</span>, evidence of an alibi placing the witness Joseph in a different location at the time that he claimed that the brothers had committed the crimes he had accused them of. This is why they had to resort to the ruse of ganging up on him simultaneously. No human court could then prove that either one of them had administered a lethal blow. They felt quite at ease vis-a-vis heaven, being convinced that Joseph wanted to kill them. All of these considerations helped G'd carry out what He had planned without interfering with the freedom of will of the brothers or of Joseph. Perhaps the brothers even alluded to the fact that they would eventually repent what they were about to do and this is why they said <span class=\"font1\">ועתה</span>, i.e. \"for now this is what we are going to do.\" <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 21,6 claims that whenever the expression <span class=\"font1\">ועתה</span> is used it refers to repentance.",

The brothers sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites using the Midianites as middlemen. The Ishmaelites would have refused to buy a human being (who presumably had been a free man) from the brothers directly.

The Torah emphasises <span class=\"font1\"><b>מיד</b> הישמעלים</span>, to make certain that we understand that Joseph was in the physical possession of the Ishmaelites who handed him over to Potiphar.

Once he had become a slave there were no known ways in which Joseph could rise to a higher status, much less to that of king.

This would have been appropriate if Jacob had lost an only son, or even one of relatively few children. Since Jacob had many children, he should have remembered what he had left instead of only harping on what he had lost. His children brought this to Jacob's attention without uttering a word by surrounding him with their combined presence. This was supposed to provide some comfort. Jacob, however, refused to accept comfort, saying that the reason he would mourn Joseph until his own death was that Joseph was one of a kind and there was no substitute for him.

The reason was that as of then they were both in jail, normal distinctions between their standing in society did not apply. He may also have thought that their distress had something to do with him personally. The reason the Torah underlined: \"in the house of his master,\" is that Joseph wondered if the distress of the ministers was directed against Joseph's superior, the chief warden.

This is why Joseph was anxious that they should tell their dreams to him rather than to someone else in order that his interpretation would be fulfilled. He said: <span class=\"font1\">ספרו נא</span>, \"please tell now!\" Although we have mentioned that there were twenty four interpreters in Jersualem each one of whom was able to give a different yet true interpretation to the same dream, I maintain that this was so only because none of the twenty four interpretations contradicted one another.

His body was kidnapped, and the people who bought him were fooled because they thought they had bought a slave, whereas in fact they paid for a free man. As a result the people who had paid for Joseph did not really own him. Perhaps Joseph wanted to explode the myth that no slave could ever rule nor wear royal robes in Egypt by explaining that this did not apply to him seeing he had never been a slave (compare <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 89,7). Since Joseph realised that the chief butler's dream indicated that he, Joseph, would rise to greatness, he was insistent that the chief butler be aware that he had been born free, that his present status as a slave was due only to his having been kidnapped from his homeland.

Even though this exile had been decreed almost two hundred years previously, it had not been decreed anywhere that this exile had to be in Egypt. Moreover, the exile turned out to be more cruel than necessary in order to satisfy G'd's decree as we know from <i>Tossaphot on Shabbat</i> 10 and as the <span class=\"font1\">ראב׳ד</span> has written in a glossary on Maimonides's <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> chapter six. He explains that the Egyptians behaved in an abnormally cruel manner as indicated by Genesis 15,13.",
                    "An additional reason for introducing this paragraph with the word <span class=\"font1\">ויהי</span> is that G'd announced that there would be a famine and G'd always shares the pain He inflicts on His world (compare <i>Megillah</i> 10 on Exodus 14,20).",

Originally, it had been intended that Joseph should be released at that time (<i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 89,2). He had to endure two additional years in jail because he had put his trust in a human being. The <i>Midrash</i> there understands the words <span class=\"font1\">ויהי מקץ</span> as indicating an end to darkness. <span class=\"font1\">קץ</span> is also a word which describes the evil urge, i.e. <span class=\"font1\">קץ כל בשר</span>. Accordingly, the Torah uses this word to allude to the reason that Joseph had to stay in jail another two years. These two years during which Joseph experienced mental anguish are counted as part of the Jewish people's exile experience because the chief butler had neglected to remember Joseph favourably. The reason that not one but two additional years were decreed was because Joseph said both <b><span class=\"font1\">כי אם זכרתני</span></b> and <b><span class=\"font1\">והזכרתני</span>.</b> He wanted to be remembered <b>and</b> to be mentioned favourably.",

                    "<b><span class=\"font1\">ופרעה חולם</span>, and Pharaoh had a dream.</b> Inasmuch as the Torah here begins with the introduction of a new episode, we would have expected either the word <span class=\"font1\">חלם</span>, or <span class=\"font1\">ויחלום</span>, <b>he dreamt,</b> not <span class=\"font1\">חולם</span>, <b>he was dreaming</b>. The latter word would only be appropriate if the Torah told us about the continuation of something that we knew had begun previously. Actually, the Torah uses this present tense in this case to show that Pharaoh's dream was a direct continuation of events which had begun when the chief butler and the chief of the bakers had had their dreams. The Torah wanted to show us that even though the chief butler did not want to help Joseph get out of jail, G'd had other means at His disposal to help Joseph get out of jail. It is therefore best to imagine the last verse of the previous chapter and the first verse in this chapter as being continuous, thus: \"since the chief butler did not remember Joseph and forgot him Pharaoh had a dream at the end of two years.\" This eventually forced the chief butler to speak up and mention Joseph as a successful interpreter of dreams.",

The reason he felt that way was that the events that occurred during the dream were so totally unlikely. The Torah wishes to teach us a lesson here about how to determine if a dream has meaning as a message to the person who dreams it. When a person feels during his dream that he must explore the meaning of what has appeared to him in the dream, this is a clear sign that the dream cannot be dismissed as being of no consequence but that it presages something that will occur in the future."

                    "Actually, the Torah described that Pharaoh was very clever, trying to commit Joseph to interpret the dream by not giving him any excuses not to do so. He told him that he had been told that Joseph himself had described himself as an interpreter of dreams. Now he either had to interpret Pharaoh's dream or admit that he was a swindler and had interpreted dreams incorrectly. When Pharaoh said to Joseph: \"I have heard it said about you that you listen to a dream and interpret it,\" he meant that this was what Joseph himself had claimed. Pharaoh was partially correct; Joseph had indeed invited the chief butler and the chief of the bakers to \"tell\" him their dreams so that he could interpret them (40,7). It may be assumed that the chief butler reported the events to Pharaoh faithfully. It is also possible that Pharaoh surmised that his senior ministers would not have volunteered to tell a Hebrew slave their dreams unless they had been invited to do so. Now Joseph had to interpret Pharaoh's dream in order to justify his reputation."

He explains that G'd knows the interpretations of dreams and informs certain human beings of this. The same had taken place when Joseph had told the chief butler and the chief of the bakers that the interpretations were G'd's, not his. He had invited those men to tell him their dreams in the hope that an interpretation could be found. He had never claimed an exclusive on that knowledge. This is also why he added: <span class=\"font1\">אלוקים יענה</span>, \"G'd may provide the answer.\" He added the word <span class=\"font1\">שלום</span> in order to warn Pharaoh not to take offence if perchance the interpretation would not be to his liking and would presage something unpleasant. He should not accuse Joseph on the basis of \"the dreams follow the interpretation chosen by the mouth\" (of the interpreter). Even if he were to come up with an interpretation that forecast trouble, he was only G'd's mouthpiece, the source was G'd.",
                    "Joseph may also have had something quite different in mind when he said: \"may G'd answer the peace of Pharaoh.\" He emphasised that in contrast with ordinary interpreters who are able to bend the meaning of the dream according to their choice, he, Joseph, could not do so. He could only relate the objective meaning of what Pharaoh had seen in his dream. [<i>Berachot</i> 56 lists a variety of dreams and how the interpretation which seemed to contradict the impression left on the dreamer came true, thus proving that much depends on the person who interprets the dream.

There would be a period of abundance of agricultural products; there would come a famine; Pharaoh was given a chance to appoint a leader who could head off the impact of the famine. Even though Joseph did not mention who that person should be, the fact that G'd had withheld the interpretation of the dream from all other potential candidates for such leadership and had brought Joseph to Pharaoh's attention through the chief butler who had told him what happened to him, made Joseph a natural choice for this appointment.

Were it not so the words \"in the land of Egypt\" would be misleading. Joseph realised all this by the appearance of the cows. When the lean cows were described as so exceptionally thin and poorly, this could not have been so if the whole earth had experienced abundance in the years preceding the famine. Egypt could then have imported food which the other countries had accumulated during the years of plenty. It was therefore clear to Joseph that the famine would be world wide whereas the plentiful years would be restricted to the land of Egypt."

Not only would they not build silos, they might even decide to plant less in order to maintain the prices. As a result they would not bother to plough. When they would see another year of bumper crops their negligent attitude would only be further reinforced. This is why G'd explained in Pharaoh's dream that the surplus during the coming seven years was only meant to compensate in advance for the absence of crops during the following seven years.

Joseph had already fulfilled that commandment, ergo he could not have marital relations during the famine.

This appears unacceptable seeing the whole rule is based on scripture. Besides, the Torah testifies to Levi's piety in Deut. 33,8, suggesting that of all the sons of Jacob he was the most pious. Even though the statement in Deuteronomy refers to the descendants of Levi, i.e. the branches, it is most certainly applicable also to the root, i.e. to Levi himself.

Inasmuch as Jacob was known to have a sufficient supply of food (compare <i>Taanit</i> 10) and he only sent his sons to Egypt for appearances' sake (so as not to arouse the envy of his neighbours) as we know from Rashi on Genesis 42,1 <span class=\"font1\">למה תתראו</span>, Levi had acted one hundred percent within accepted Jewish norms. While it is true that there is a statement in <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 91, that Jacob's family did not even have any barley left, that statement refers to the second year of the famine. During the first year they certainly had enough grain left and Levi had every right to sleep with his wife. They did not have to refrain from conjugal relations on account of Joseph. Joseph was only an individual and the rule applies only to when a community is in economic straits. It is possible that Joseph refrained from conjugal relations with his wife during the famine because he knew that his family in the land of Canaan was suffering from the famine (the first year before they came to him)."

We read there as follows: \"If a group of people travel together and they encounter Gentiles who demand that one of them be handed over to be killed, the alternative being that they would all be killed, it is forbidden to hand over anyone belonging to the group. The whole group must face death rather than make the decision whom to hand over. If, however, the person to be handed over had been named by the killers, the others may save their lives by handing over that person.\" When Joseph said: \"if you are honest, etc.,\" he meant that the brothers knew full well if they were telling the truth; <span class=\"font1\">אחיכם אחד</span>, your one brother will be imprisoned. There was <b>no death threat</b> to the brothers, hence they were allowed to choose whom to hand over for incarceration. Joseph implied that if, on the other hand, they were dishonest, i.e. spies, (which made all of them guilty of the death penalty) then, of course, they would not be allowed to hand over one of their number who had not been specified. Handing over their brother would then be tantamount to killing him. This would also be illegal as they would all have to be prepared to die. The brothers were agreeable, thus indicating that they had spoken truthfully all along. We may presume that the brothers <b>themselves</b> elected that Shimon be imprisoned; Joseph did not single him out.",
                    "It is also possible that the brothers had agreed between themselves to leave one of their number behind as a guarantee but before they could agree on who it should be Joseph decided to keep Shimon as he considered Shimon and Levi together as very dangerous."

Moreover, it would be forbidden to hand over an unnamed individual if there was a likelihood he was guilty of the death penalty. Another possible meaning of these words is simply that by bringing Benjamin down to Egypt Joseph would make sure their families would not die of starvation.

Onkelos translates it as \"truthfully;\" I do not agree with this translation either. There was no need for the brothers to say: \"truthfully,\" as if they had so far not spoken truthfully.

The common denominator up to that point had been the fact that they had sold Joseph. Since Reuben had been innocent of that crime, not having been present when both the suggestion and the implementation of selling Joseph had been made, they had to search for something that both they and Reuben were guilty of. They concluded therefore that it must have been their heartlessness. Reuben too had not responded to Joseph's pleas as he had suggested that the brothers throw him in the pit instead of killing him outright. No doubt Joseph had pleaded with <b>all</b> the brothers not to do that to him. In fact, slow death in the pit was a more frightening prospect to Joseph than a relatively swift death. The words <span class=\"font1\">על כן באה אלינו</span> are an acknowledgement that they all, Reuben included, were guilty of a lack of compassion. Presumably, the brothers must have said these things as soon as they were being led to prison, whereas the Torah reports them as if they had been said after they had all been in prison for three days. Why does the Torah make it appear as if the brothers had only come to this realisation after three days in prison? Presumably, the Torah did not want to diminish the impact Joseph's words and deeds are to make upon the reader. Any diversion would detract us from the clever way Joseph set about creating the scenario he had planned.",

                    "Perhaps up to the time when Joseph had said that one of their number had to remain in prison as hostage, they had not related their present experience to the sale of Joseph at all. They had thought that inasmuch as man is a free agent that whatever had happened to them was in retribution for freely committed wrongs. They had not considered what they had done to Joseph as a wrong at all. When Joseph pointedly said: \"one of your <b>brothers</b> has to stay here,\" they suddenly realised that their situation was connected to what they had done to another one of their brothers. The words <span class=\"font1\">ויעשו כן</span> then mean that <b>they</b> singled out Shimon. They suddenly realised that the painful experience they now underwent of leaving one of their brothers with a stranger was tit for tat for having abandoned Joseph to a fate with strangers at the time of the sale. I have frequently alluded to the fact that guilt somehow creates situations in which the retribution experienced reminds one of the nature of one's sin. David has mentioned this in Psalms 62,13: <span class=\"font1\">כי אתה תשלם לאיש כמעשהו</span>, \"for You repay each man according to his deeds.\" The brothers saying <span class=\"font1\">אבל</span> may therefore be understood thus: \"If our present experience had been even slightly different we would not have realised why we are now being punished; but the very fact that our punishment corresponds to the nature of our sin convinces us of our guilt. Now we are absolutely certain that we are guilty of lack of compassion.\"",

Reuben retorted that he did not consider himself included in that sin as he had warned: \"do not commit a sin against the boy!\" Even though at that time he had only warned them not to lay a hand upon Joseph and to throw him into the pit, his intention had been as if he had said: \"do not commit a sin.\" The Torah itself exonerated Reuben independently by revealing Reuben's intention to restore Joseph to his father.",

                    "The fact is that Reuben's principal complaint against the brothers was that he told them not to lay a hand upon Joseph. \"Selling him into slavery was certainly laying a hand upon him!\" Reuben's argument was certainly valid; moreover, by selling Joseph to other human beings the brothers had made his fate dependent on people with a free will who could act arbitrarily. Reuben's intention had been not to allow Joseph's fate to be in the hands of people who could make arbitrary decisions. Selling Joseph did not reduce the danger to Joseph's life or wellbeing any more than throwing him into the pit. We only need to read the <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 86,3 according to which Potiphar bought Joseph to commit acts of sodomy with him. G'd Himself made Potiphar impotent to protect Joseph against such abuse. When Reuben had advised throwing Joseph into the pit he felt that if Joseph was not guilty nothing would happen to him. He had been most concerned to remove Joseph from the hands of people who could arbitrarily decide his fate.

Reuben resented being considered a partner of that part of the brothers' crime. He was not willing to share their responsibility seeing he had not taken part in the sale. As of that moment Reuben only agreed to remain with them, but not to share their guilt. At the end of the examination it would become clear who was legally guilty and who was innocent.

Compare <span class=\"font1\">ובאהרון התאנף</span> Deut. 9,20. <i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 7,1 makes this point. Reuben made it clear that he did not want to risk losing more than two of his sons if he failed to honour his guarantee of Benjamin's safe return. His reason was that if he risked more he would nullify the merit of having fulfilled the commandment to be fruitful. He therefore risked only something that would not impair his standing in the Hereafter. Yehudah understood Reuben very well; this is why he undertook to risk even his life in the Hereafter in order to secure Jacob's consent to take Benjamin to Egypt and to secure their lives in the present world first (compare 43,9).",

The Talmud cites Yehudah's statement \"if I do not bring him back to you\" as proof. We have a tradition quoted by Rabbi Shemuel bar Nachmeni in the name of Rabbi Yochanan that the reason Yehudah and Reuben are linked in Moses' blessing in Deuteronomy 33,6 \"may Reuben live and not die\" followed by the statement \"<span class=\"font1\">וזאת ליהודה</span>,\" is that during all the forty years the Jewish people travelled through the desert with the coffin of Yehudah, the bones in his coffin still kept turning over. If you were to say that perhaps Yehudah's fault had been that he had not spelled out what would happen if he fulfilled his guarantee as did the tribe of Gad and Reuben in Numbers 32,29-30 [something known as <span class=\"font1\">תנאי כפול</span> in halachah, Ed.], the fact remains that he did deliver on his promise, so why should he be guilty of anything?

In the case of Yehudah, he had no control over what Joseph would or would not do. As a result the conditional excommunication that Yehudah was prepared to endure never became effective legally.",
                    "It is no more than reasonable that when someone makes an undertaking to endure excommunication in the event that he will not fulfil his undertaking (such as that of Yehudah, who was unable to know if he would be able to make good on it), he would require that such an undertaking be cancelled by the appropriate religious authority. It does not matter whether one phrased such an undertaking as a <span class=\"font1\">תנאי כפול</span>, spelling out the alternative, or not. The very fact that one ties one's fate to something over which one has no control is frivolous. Yehudah's bones rattling in his coffin is quite plausible then, seeing he did not have his undertaking voided by his father or some other religious authority.",

According to <i>Midrash Tanchuma</i> on this verse Joseph's adjutant was his son Menashe, and we have an example here of the power of the son exceeding that of his father. Menashe was certain that his father would concur with his remarks. The reason Menashe added: \"do not fear\" was because he could see fear expressed on the brothers' faces. The Torah confirms this (verse 18) when it wrote: <span class=\"font1\">וייראו האנשים</span>, \"The men were afraid.\"",

Apparently they were interrupted before they entered Joseph's home when they stopped in front of the house. The reason was that the brothers first wanted to explain that they had found their money in their bags when they had arrived back in Canaan. They wanted to know why they were being brought to Joseph's home. They were not sure whether this bode them good or ill. After Shimon had been released they realised that they were to be made welcome. This is why the Torah had to repeat the fact that they were brought to Joseph's palace, i.e. as guests not as prisoners."

If the enquiry after their father's wellbeing meant if he was still alive , why did Joseph ask about this twice? The brothers' reply is difficult also. They too first answered that their father was well and then added that he was alive. What news did they add by confirming that their father was still alive?",
                    "Perhaps Joseph wanted to know if Jacob's wellbeing had been affected by his aging or whether he was as spry as ever. Perhaps this is why he added the word <span class=\"font1\">עודנו</span>, i.e. is he as well as when you came here the last time? This is why Joseph was clever in asking first about their father's welfare before asking if he was still alive. The question then was not whether Jacob was actually alive, but whether he was as alive as the last time. An aging father could have been described as being well even if his mental and physical alertness had declined somewhat with age."

We can hardly assume that he wanted to cause his brothers anguish after he had invited them to his palace and had wined and dined them. Perhaps Joseph had three separate motivations. 1) He wanted that they should be able to atone for having stolen him at the time. By accusing them of theft they would feel the embarassment a thief feels when he has been found out. Once they experienced this feeling they could atone for the sale of Joseph. 2) He wanted to find out if the brothers would risk their lives for the freedom of Benjamin. This would enable him to gauge the degree of brotherliness they felt towards Benjamin. This in turn would enable Joseph to forgive them their sin against him. 3) He sent them a signal that there was somebody in the viceroy's palace who was thoroughly familiar with their past history. He had already made them curious about this on the previous day when he had seated them according to their respective ages at lunch (43,33)."

After all, the adjutant was the very person whom they had told that they had found that money and had brought it back with them. As a result, logic should convince him that the brothers had already established their honesty beyond doubt. In fact the brothers were going to use that argument presently. The words: \"you have done something bad,\" were designed to demolish their argument even before they could present it. Henceforth the adjutant would not allow his suspicions against them to be influenced by invoking their past actions. The brothers having returned the money had been motivated by something other than their honesty.",

This is why they introduced their argument with the words <span class=\"font1\">הן כסף, וגו</span>. They agreed that a thief might indeed act in the manner suggested by the adjutant, i.e. establish his credentials by a spurious act such as claiming to return money which he had never stolen in the first place. However, no person who had legally acquired what he had found and had discovered this only after having travelled a long distance as had the brothers, would go to so much trouble merely in order to establish such a point. Besides, they had long ago disposed of the actual money they had discovered. It was totally unbecoming to suspect them of having returned the money for any ulterior motive. Only meticulously honest people would do what they had done. As to the adjutant's argument that the goblet was so valuable because of its properties connected with sorcery, this was meaningless to them. It might be of value to the adjutant's master, but as far as they were concerned the goblet was a mere silver trinket, not worth more than hundreds like it. After all, they were not sorcerers; what good would possession of this goblet be to them?"

Shimon had been in jail and Benjamin had not been in Egypt previously. The adjutant therefore reduced his suspicion from a collective one to one addressed to either Shimon or Benjamin.

He was only authorised to deal with guilt which was obvious to him. He was entitled to judge the person in whose possession the goblet had been found. The brothers were free to go home, however. Joseph thought that by allowing them all to go and by keeping only Benjamin as a slave he had appeased Yehudah. He felt certain that Yehudah had accepted the verdict. How was he to know that Yehudah would immediately begin to lambast him as is evident in the following verses. According to our view Yehudah reasoned with Joseph as long as he felt that they were all being punished for something they had done in the past. When he realised that innocent Benjamin was being singled out for punishment whereas they, the guilty ones, were allowed to go free, he realised that he did not confront divine judgment in the person of Joseph, but that Joseph was a capricious ruler who had framed Benjamin for reasons of his own.

Our sages in <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 93,6 explained that the word <span class=\"font1\">ויגש</span> refers to Yehudah girding himself for war. This is a homiletical commentary.

The circle of advisers separates the petitioner from the king who presides on the throne. Up until this point Yehudah had stood outside the circle.

This was the reason Yehudah emphasised that he was Joseph's servant. The reason that Yehudah said: \"for you are just like Pharaoh\" is explained in <i>A vodah Zarah</i> 10 in a story involving a certain Ketiah bar Shalum. A certain Roman Emperor disliked the Jews and consulted his advisers what he should do about them. He asked whether if one has a painful fibroid in one's foot one should cut it off and be at ease or whether one should allow it to remain and suffer pain? The advice of all the other ministers was that the Emperor should have the fibroid removed. Ketiah- also one of the officers of the Emperor- said to him: \"first of all you cannot get rid of <b>all</b> the Jews, quoting a verse in Zachariah 2,10. Secondly, if you do this your empire will henceforth be known as one that kills its own subjects.\" The king replied that Ketiah's advice was sound but that there was a law which stipulated that anyone who obstructed the wishes of the emperor must be thrown into the furnace. He had Ketiah executed. As soon as Ketiah was burned to death a heavenly voice was heard proclaiming that Ketiah had acquired his life in the Hereafter in the time it had taken for him to suggest the Jews be saved. Yehudah was careful not to create a situation which would make his words boomerang on himself as had the words of Ketiah. This is why he wanted no one to hear what he had to say to Joseph.",
                    "The words: \"for you are just like Pharaoh\" may also be understood in a sense similar to Proverbs 21,1: \"the king's heart is in the Lord's hands.\" This means that the king is privileged to receive divine assistance before pronouncing judgment. If Yehudah were to speak publicly, his advisers would pressure Joseph not to follow his heart's inclination so that ultimately he would not decide according to the will of heaven. By speaking in this way Yehudah indicated to Joseph that he considered him a fair ruler, and that his closest advisers were the ones who were in danger of committing a travesty of justice.",
                    "A homiletical approach to the words <span class=\"font1\">ויגש אליו</span> may be similar to what Solomon tells us in Proverbs 27,19: \"as face to face is reflected in water, so man's heart will be reflected by his counter-part.\" Yehudah endeavoured to turn Joseph's heart towards himself. Yehudah had to make a special effort in this regard as there is a natural dislike between idol worhippers and the servants of the one and only G'd as we know from Psalms 125,3. In this instance, keeping in mind his immediate concern, Yehudah had to overcome his natural dislike for people who worshipped idols.",
                    "The word may simply reflect the fact that now that Yehudah was convinced that what had happened was at the initiative of Joseph and not that of G'd, he \"approached\" the whole subject differently.",

                    "Yehudah said: \"please my lord\" for three reasons. 1) He had to explain to Joseph why he alone kept speaking. This was especially so seeing Joseph had already demonstrated that he knew that Reuben was the oldest brother when he had seated the brothers according to their age (43,33). Joseph was liable to interrupt him at any moment demanding to know why Reuben was not acting as the spokesman. Yehudah therefore wanted to explain this before Joseph could become angry. He explained that Benjamin's detention concerned him most because of the guarantee he had given to his father. 2) He used a stratagem designed to free Benjamin by claiming that he himself had stolen the goblet but had hidden it in Benjamin's pouch, deflecting any suspicion from himself in the event that the goblet would be found. It was only proper then that he and not Benjamin should pay the penalty. Now the situation was that Benjamin denied being a thief whereas Yehudah confessed. 3) The word <span class=\"font1\">בי</span> may be an allusion by the Torah to the present time when Joseph was the ruler; ultimately, however, authority would pass to Yehudah, i.e. the kingdom of David who was a descendant of Yehudah.",

The woman from Tekoah presented a ficticious case and asked for David's judgment. The judgment involved bringing to justice the remaining son of that woman who reportedly had slain her other son. Yehudah argued that once he would return to his father without Benjamin having explained that he was quite innocent in the matter, his father, having already lost his favourite son, would certainly not bereave himself a second time by consigning Yehudah to exile; this is the reason Yehudah presented a second argument, i.e. that his father would die from heartbreak."

Why did he not at least write his father a letter to temper his father's pain and to stop him from mourning him? Not only this, why did he not at least send a message to his father during the year of famine when there was a constant stream of travellers between Egypt and Canaan?

On the other hand, he considered a statement by our sages in <i>Baba Metzia</i> 59 that it is preferable to be burned in a fiery oven than to cause a fellow human being to go pale with shame. Joseph was concerned for his brothers' dignity as human beings, something they would lose if their father would find out at that point what the brothers had done to his favourite child. He decided therefore that the anguish of one man, i.e. his father, was preferable to discrediting his brothers.",

When <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 91 described the brothers as taking a great deal of money to Egypt in order to ransom Joseph, this merely means that they hoped to succeed in order to demonstrate that they were sorry for what they had done. Only then would they no longer feel threatened by him and plan to dispose of him. ",

Only after that experience did Joseph realise that he was no longer in danger from his brothers. Until all the pieces of the puzzle came together at the time Joseph decided to reveal himself to his brothers it would have been premature to risk identifying himself. Until Joseph was able to put the brothers at ease by attributing all that had happened to G'd's planning, he would have been risking his life by revealing himself. You will recall that Yehudah had resorted to a confrontational stance when he found out that Joseph had included innocent Reuben in his treatment of the brothers. <i>Tanchuma</i> item 5 on our <i>Parshah</i> even reports the brothers as planning to kill Joseph [not in his capacity as Joseph, of course, but in his capacity of a ruler who had framed Benjamin, Ed.], and that it had taken an angel to save Joseph from their hands.

If it was the fear of ushering in exile for his family, how did G'd's assurance alleviate that fear? If, on the other hand, G'd meant to console him that there would be no exile there, history teaches that Jacob's family became enslaved and suffered persecution and hard labour in Egypt! Besides, how did the announcement that Jacob would become a great nation while in Egypt console him over what he was afraid of?

No doubt Abraham had informed his son and grandson of this decree. When Jacob saw that food was for sale in Egypt, he immediately associated this with the fact that his descendants would endure exile there. He was afraid that this exile would commence the moment he arrived in Egypt.. He was also worried that he would be buried there, in a land which was totally impure. G'd therefore appeared to him in a dream describing Himself as the G'd of his father; He meant that just as the exile had not commenced during Isaac's life and Isaac had not experienced persecution, so it would not commence during Jacob's lifetime either. Concerning Jacob's intention to return to the land of Canaan as soon as the famine was over, G'd told Jacob that he would develop into a great nation in Egypt; in other words, G'd had a good reason why Jacob would not return to the land of Canaan soon. G'd alluded to this by saying <span class=\"font1\">כי לגוי גדול אשימך שם</span>, i.e. in order for this to be accomplished you have to stay there for some considerable time.",
                    "In order to understand the whole concept I must preface by quoting a tradition we have in the name of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his colleagues (recorded in <i>Likutey Torah, Miketz).</i> The purpose of the various exiles is to isolate segments of sanctity which are scattered Within various branches of the <span class=\"font1\">קליפה</span>, the \"peel\" surrounding the kernel which is all sanctity. Inasmuch as Egypt was full of abominations [manifestations of such a <span class=\"font1\">קליפה</span>, Ed.] and impurity had its \"headquarters\" in that country, it was no more than natural that many such segments of sanctity were scattered throughout that country. In fact the amounts of such scattered segments of sanctity are usually proportionate to the amount of impurity and defilement that abound in a certain area or environment. The phenomenon we have just described originated as soon as Adam sinned. It has been Israel's task to \"rescue\" all those splinters of sanctity and to make them part of a whole. Our sages (quoted in <i>Likutey Torah</i> on <i>Parshat Vayeshev)</i> have said that the nation that left Egypt and experienced the revelation at Mount Sinai was previously captive within this <span class=\"font1\">קליפה</span> called Egypt. It is to such a nation that Moses said in Deut. 4,8: \"who is a <b>great</b> nation possessing such righteous statutes, etc.\" G'd told Jacob that the purpose of Israel spending time in exile in Egypt was to enable it to develop into this great nation. \"The great nation\" [all the fragments of sanctity, Ed.] at that time was \"lost\" amongst all the Egyptians and it had to be isolated and then led out from there. Unless Jacob descended to Egypt at this time, there would be no hope of accomplishing this. It was because Jacob represented sanctity in a powerful and concentrated form that he could become the \"magnet\" which would attract the various scattered segments of sanctity that still abounded in Egypt in an ineffectual form. This is the meaning of the statement in <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 79,1 that Jacob did not depart from this world until he had seen 600.000 descendants. These 600.000 were the ones who endured persecution there and were ultimately refined in what our sages are fond of calling the \"iron crucible\" which welded the Jewish people into a nation and enabled them to leave Egypt after having been refined. Jacob understood then that is was necessary for him to settle in Egypt for the rest of his life and he was no longer filled with dismay at that prospect, especially so since G'd assured him that he personally, would not experience oppression and persecution. As to Jacob's final concern, that he would not want to be buried amidst the impurities that Egypt was full of, G'd assured him that He would see to it that Jacob would be buried in the land of Israel."

                    "Perhaps what G'd had in mind when He told Jacob that He would descend with him to Egypt was that whenever he or the Jewish people would experience problems, G'd would share their suffering (compare Psalms 91,15 \"I am with him in distress\"). <b><span class=\"font1\">אנכי ארד עמך מצרימה</span></b>, the word <span class=\"font1\"><b>מצר</b>ימה</span>, may be derived from the word <span class=\"font1\">מצר</span>, \"a narrow, confined area.\" G'd hinted that whenever Jacob (the Jewish people) would find themselves hemmed in, He would share their misery. G'd demonstrated this to Moses when He appeared to him out of the burning bush, certainly not a dwelling fit for G'd. G'd's message was that as long as the Jewish people are in distress in Egypt, He Himself would reside in such locations as the lowly thornbush. The <span class=\"font1\">שכינה</span> never descended to the part of Egypt which was full of impurity. There are numerous instances (such as in <i>Megillah</i> 29) where the descent of the <span class=\"font1\">שכינה</span> to Egypt is understood to mean that G'd shared the exile experience of the Jewish people with them. When Israel (Jacob) is described as prostrating himself at the head of the bed in Genesis 47,31, <i>Tanchuma</i> understands this as Jacob bowing down to the presence of the <span class=\"font1\">שכינה</span>. [Evidently the presence of the <span class=\"font1\">שכינה</span> was felt in Egypt then. Ed.] Moreover, <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 94,9 understands that the <span class=\"font1\">שכינה</span> made up the number 70 in the list of descendants coming down to Egypt with Jacob, seeing that you will find only 69 names listed there. All of this proves that the <span class=\"font1\">שכינה</span> did descend to Egypt (though not to areas infested with impurity).",

We are taught in <i>Avot</i> 3,6 that when ten people sit together and are preoccupied with Torah, the <span class=\"font1\">שכינה</span> rests amongst them. The rabbis in the <i>Mishnah</i> there are at pains to prove from scriptural quotations that even a single individual studying Torah is accompanied by the <span class=\"font1\">שכינה</span>. On the other hand, we find that the <span class=\"font1\">שכינה</span> did not descend from heaven to take up residence amongst the Jewish people until the latter had established the Tabernacle (compare Exodus 40,35) and had made numerous preparations to qualify for hosting the <span class=\"font1\">שכינה</span>. How is it possible that no such preparations appear to be required for an individual who studies Torah and qualifies for G'd's Presence as stated in <i>Avot?</i> Clearly, when one speaks of the presence of the <span class=\"font1\">שכינה</span> one must distinguish between different levels of such a Divine Presence. The amount of enlightenment one experiences depends on the level of Divine Presence one is privileged to experience. If we were to describe such different levels of a Divine Presence, we could categorise the revelation at Mount Sinai as the highest level of such a Divine Presence. The next lower level may be the Divine Presence in the Holy of Holies in the Temple. A slightly lesser level of G'd's Presence may be experienced by the \"average\" prophet at the time he receives a message from G'd. Progressively lower levels of such a Divine Presence may be found in synagogues or houses of study. A group of ten people discussing matters related to Torah-study may qualify for an even lesser degree of such a Divine Presence, etc. When we keep this in mind we can better understand the statement of our sages that the Divine Presence, i.e. the enlightenment provided to a prophet never descended to certain levels. As a result, Moses had to leave the city in order to qualify for the degree of Divine Presence that could respond to his prayer. The degree of Divine Presence found amongst a group of people studying Torah is of a lower level, however, and it was that level of the <span class=\"font1\">שכינה</span> which descended to Egypt with Jacob and remained there until the Exodus.",
                    "While it may sound presumptuous to differentiate between different degrees of Divine light, this is true as long as we speak of G'd Himself. Light which radiates from G'd, however, is subject to different \"filters\" in order to ensure that the recipient receives the amount which is beneficial to him and does not harm him through over-exposure. The same principle applies even to different souls, all of which may be perceived as parts of G'd's \"light\" emanating from G'd's throne of glory.",
                    "The considerations we have just mentioned may also explain why G'd referred to Himself <b>twice</b> as <span class=\"font1\">אנכי</span> when telling Jacob that He would descend with him to Egypt and would go up with him again when Jacob would be buried. G'd meant that the level of <span class=\"font1\">שכינה</span> that would accompany him on his return would be a higher level than that which accompanied him at the time he journeyed to Egypt. It was the latter level of <span class=\"font1\">אנכי</span> which the Jewish people experienced at Mount Sinai, and it is that level of <span class=\"font1\">אנכי</span> which is experienced at the end of the forty nine years of the Jubilee cycle. This is the mystical dimension of the fact that the Exodus from Egypt is mentioned in the Torah a total of forty nine times.",
                    "The repetition by G'd of the word <span class=\"font1\">ואנכי</span> may also be an allusion that the redemption when it would occur would be orchestrated by G'd personally, not merely by one of His agents (compare Deut. 6,21 and Exodus 13,16).",
                    "The reason G'd repeated the words <span class=\"font1\">אעלך גם עלה</span>, \"I will also bring you up from there\" is, that G'd will 1) see to it that Jacob will be buried in Canaan; 2) that the Jewish people will be led out of exile by G'd. G'd added the word <span class=\"font1\">גם</span>, also, as an allusion that both the regular Jewish people will be redeemed as well as the lost souls which had been captive amongst all the impurity in that country and about which we have written earlier. All of them would ascend to the land of Israel.",
                    "It is also possible that the word <span class=\"font1\">גם</span> refers to the spirituality which descended to Egypt with Jacob. It will be redeemed.

It was welcome news to Jacob as he had prophesied that he would descend to the grave of his son Joseph (37,36). G'd wanted Jacob to know that he had erred in that forecast.",
                    "The other part of this message was that Jacob would not return to the land of Canaan alive. In fact this statement may be construed as G'd prohibiting Jacob from returning to Canaan as this would frustrate G'd's promise that Joseph would be present at his death. Since Joseph was not allowed to leave Egypt G'd would not be able to keep His promise to Jacob unless he lived out his life in Egypt."

This is why they agreed only at this point to take their mobile possessions with them.

The report could have been considerably condensed without omitting any of the details.",
                    "The Torah tries to tell us that there were ideological differences between the sons of Jacob. Some agreed willingly to migrate to Egypt and to accept the burden of G'd's decree that their children would become slaves in Egypt. Others strove to delay as long as possible the descent to the land which would be known as the \"iron crucible\" of the Jewish people. The Torah tries to describe who was who by mentioning separately <span class=\"font1\">בניו ובני בניו אתו</span> on the one hand, meaning that those did not have to be persuaded to undertake the journey with Jacob. On the other hand, when the verse continues to speak separately about Jacob <b>bringing</b> with him \"his daughters, granddaughters and all his descendants,\" these are the people who did not go down to Egypt voluntarily.",

This is based on the Torah telling us in Exodus 1,6 that \"Joseph and all that generation died.\" The words \"and all that generation\" refer to those who came to Egypt from Canaan. Perhaps the Torah teaches us that the people who had accepted G'd's decree willingly were spared realisation of that decree during their own lifetime. Perhaps the best proof of this is the fact that Yocheved and Serach, daughter of Asher, who both arrived in Egypt with the family of Jacob did experience the enslavement. The reason was that they were not around when a decision had to be made to descend to Egypt. They were still in their mother's wombs (compare <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 94,9). It is worth- while to peruse what the <i>Zohar on Vayakhel 198</i> has to say on the subject. He quotes Psalms 146,5 \"hail to him who has the G'd of Jacob for his help, because his hope was in the Lord.\""

",
                    "Although we have already quoted the <i>Midrash</i> according to which Yocheved was born \"between the walls,\" i.e. at the time Jacob and his family entered Egypt, there is no proof or even hint of this in the Torah. There is no unanimity on that subject amongst our sages seeing that we have the view that the <span class=\"font1\">שכינה</span> should be considered as making up the missing number between 69 and 70. If Yocheved were indeed to be included in the count we would then have a total of 71 instead of seventy. Proof of the accuracy of the statement of our sages is found in verse 27 where the Torah mentions that the total number of persons <b>arriving</b> in Egypt was 70. Why would the <span class=\"font1\">שכינה</span> be considered as making up the missing number 33 in verse eight, instead of applying equally to the whole family, i.e. accounting for the difference between 69 and 70? Moreover, if Yocheved made up the number 33 in verse 8, then the number mentioned in verse 27 ought to have been 67 instead of 66. This would comprise 33 of Leah, 16 of Zilpah, 11 of Rachel -excluding Joseph and his two sons who were already in Egypt,- plus 7 of Bilhah. Why does the Torah appear to contradict itself by writing: \"all the persons were 66,\" when in fact there were 67? ",
                    "Besides, why were Joseph and his sons included in the count in verse 27 when we are told about a total number of 70?",
                    "The plain meaning of these verses is undoubtedly that the Torah informs us about two sets of numbers. One count refers to Jacob plus his family, the other to Jacob's descendants by themselves. When Jacob and his children are added up together we have the number 70. When the numbers exclude Jacob we have a total of 69.",
                    "The Torah is quite accurate by explaining that in the first count Jacob is specifically included in verse 8 where the Torah emphasised <span class=\"font1\">יעקב ובניו</span>, Jacob <b>and</b> his sons. While the Torah reports on a count which included Jacob himself, the report in verse 8 which arrives at a total of 33 persons for Jacob and the family of Leah is absolutely correct (not including Yocheved). We may even speculate that the word <span class=\"font1\">כל</span> was intended to make it clear that Jacob himself is part of that number. The fact that the Torah does not use the word <span class=\"font1\">כל</span> when listing the total of Zilpah's family reinforces our belief that the word <span class=\"font1\">כל</span> in verse eight refers to Jacob. While it is true that the Torah does use the word <span class=\"font1\">כל</span> when listing Rachel's family (verse 22), the reason is that the Torah there wanted to include Joseph's sons who are needed to make up the total listed there and who were in Egypt already. As to the word <span class=\"font1\">כל</span> in verse 25 where Bilhah's family is enumerated, the Torah wanted to emphasise by use of that term that altogether they comprised <b>only</b> seven persons.",
                    "It is interesting to observe that the expression \"birth\" in one form or another appears in connection with the families of Zilpah, Rachel and Bilhah, whereas this expression does not occur in connection with Leah's family. According to our interpretation we can account for this by the fact that not all the persons listed in connection with Leah's family were born to her or to her offspring. Had the Torah mentioned <span class=\"font1\">ותלד לאה</span> as it does when describing Bilhah's family, for instance, then the number 33 would have to puzzle us seeing that she was responsible for the birth of only 32 children at that stage. The number 33 therefore is arrived at only by including Jacob himself. ",
                    "When the Torah gives us the number 66 in verse twenty six, this is exclusive of Jacob himself, something which is emphasised by the words: \"the offspring of Jacob.\" When the Torah speaks about a total of 70 persons in verse 27, Jacob is included in what the Torah describes as <span class=\"font1\">לבית יעקב</span>, Jacob's family.",
                    "The Torah even went to the length of changing its syntax in order to make certain we understand its meaning. In verse 25 we read about <span class=\"font1\">כל הנפש הבאה לבית יעקב</span>, whereas in verse 27 we read about <span class=\"font1\">כל הנפש לבית יעקב הבאה</span>; the difference is clear. In verse 25 the arrival of the family is mentioned before the name Jacob, i.e. it excludes him. In verse 27 the name Jacob appears prior to the statement that the family arrived in Egypt. This means that Jacob himself is included in the count.",
                    "We do not wish to contradict our sages who have said that Yocheved was born between the walls separating Egypt from Canaan. Perhaps the Torah alludes to her birth with the words <span class=\"font1\">כל נפש…ובנותיו</span>. Inasmuch as apart from Dinah we do not know of any other daughters in Leah's family, the Torah's use of the plural \"his daughters\" cannot be justified unless there was at least one additional daughter who arrived in Egypt. This would be Yocheved. The Torah did not include Yocheved in the names of the people who journeyed to Egypt with Jacob since we have already explained that Jacob himself was the one who made up the number 33. There could be an additional reason why Yocheved was not included in the count. Seeing that she was only born when the family arrived in Egypt she would not be a viable human being until thirty days had elapsed. Up until that time she was still in the category of a <span class=\"font1\">נפל</span>, an aborted embryo. Do not be bothered by the fact that our explanation appears to contradict that of our sages. We have explained to you repeatedly that whenever the exegesis of our sages does not imply halachic consequences scholars of established reputations are allowed to disagree.

We find all the other grand-children introduced as: <span class=\"font1\">ובני…וגו</span>. Perhaps it is all connected with the concept of the levirate marriage. <span class=\"font1\">יבום</span> is aimed at re-establishing a presence on earth for the brother who died without leaving children. In our instance Yehudah performed this commandment instead of his son Shelah. It was Yehudah's duty to bring Er and Onan's offspring to Egypt. The Torah tells us by means of an unusual syntax that Yehudah performed this duty by bringing Chetzron and Chamul (his grandchildren) to Egypt. These two were to be considered the replacements of Er and Onan respectively. [If I understand the author correctly, he argues that because Yehudah belonged to a generation prior to that of Shelah the surviving brother of Er and Onan who should have performed the levirate marriage, only the second generation, i.e. Peretz's children, were the reincarnates of Er and Onan. Had Shelah himself performed the rites of <span class=\"font1\">יבום</span>, his first two children would have been considered as the reincarnates of Er and Onan.

                    "Looking at the plain meaning of the verse, the Torah may have explained here that the only reason that Er and Onan committed the sins that caused G'd to kill them was that they lived in the land of Canaan, a country in which sexual perversity had taken root. They had been corrupted by their environment. Apart from this one sin they were not basically bad. G'd killed them so that one should not copy their example, much as the Torah warns the Jewish people not to copy the sexual perversions practiced both in Egypt and the land of Canaan in Leviticus 18,3.",

Besides, why did Jacob not make this statement when the brothers had told him that Joseph was still alive in 45,26?",

He had been satisfied that Joseph was alive, well and powerful; he had not yet been certain that in view of all the experiences Joseph had undergone both as a slave and subsequently as a powerful ruler, that he had been able to preserve his righteousness. Jacob himself had experienced a loss of the presence of Holy Spirit at the time he had mistakenly exclaimed that Joseph had been devoured by a wild beast. He naturally was afraid that Joseph too had been cut off from such Holy Spirit seeing he had lived in close contact with people who represented the <span class=\"font1\">קליפה</span>, the personification of impurity. It is a well known fact that the righteous prefer the disappearance of a son to such a son embarassing them by abandoning his spiritual heritage. It was only when he set eyes on Joseph that he realised that Joseph had not changed. We have numerous examples in the Bible of righteous people being able to tell by merely looking at the faces of people that such people were upright and righteous. This is why Jacob was able to say <span class=\"font1\">אחרי ראותי את פניך</span>, \"after having seen your face.\" Jacob was now able to accept death without regret whenever it would occur. <i>Berachot</i> 18 mentions that the righteous are called <span class=\"font1\">חיים</span>, alive, during their lifetime.

                    "We must refer back to where Pharaoh had instructed Joseph in 45,17 - 18 to command his brothers to take their father and \"come to me.\" These instructions could have either one of two meanings. 1) Joseph should speak to the brothers conveying instructions from Pharaoh. 2) Joseph should speak to them as if he were acting on his own authority. This latter interpretation is more likely to be the correct one. We base this on 45,19 where Joseph is told \"you have been commanded, etc.\" If the instructions for the migration of Joseph's family had all originated with Pharaoh why would Joseph have to refer to permission he obtained from Pharaoh? One obtains permission after making a request for it. You will note that Joseph had spoken to the brothers about their migration in 46,31 when he was about to speak to Pharaoh about their arrival. The fact that he described the brothers as having \"come to me\" as opposed to having come to Pharaoh, seems evidence that they did not come in response to Pharaoh's invitation. In our verse, however, he did not describe the brothers as having \"come <b>to me</b>,\" but simply as \"having arrived.\" This implied that their arrival was at the behest of Pharaoh. He now wanted Pharaoh to make good on his promise. In response Pharaoh said in verse 6: \"your father and your brothers have come to you.\" Pharaoh meant to correct any impression Joseph might have had that what he had said in 45,17 -18 should have been construed as an invitation from himself for the brothers to settle there. All Pharaoh had meant was that Joseph had his <b>permission</b> to extend an invitaion to them in Pharaoh's name to settle in the best part of Egypt.",
                    "There are subtle differences between a migration as the result of Pharaoh's direct invitation and one which resulted from an invitation by Joseph which had Pharaoh's approval. On the one hand, it appears that Pharaoh was now anxious to relieve himself of any responsibility towards Joseph's brothers and clan. When a king grants a certain person an elevated status, this is normally considered a permanent gift. Had the brothers' migration been at the direct invitation of Pharaoh their status in the land of Goshen would have been permanent and irrevocable. Pharaoh was concerned lest his invitation would be perceived as that kind of gift. He preferred to have the brothers believe that the land of Goshen was allocated to them by the authority of Joseph. It was valid as long as Joseph was ruler in the land. Just as Joseph's position was not a hereditary one, so the brothers' tenure in Goshen would not be a hereditary one. Both Joseph's position and the brothers' stay in Goshen continued to depend on Pharaoh's pleasure. Pharaoh wanted to make sure that Joseph or the brothers should not think that he, Pharaoh, needed them in order to strengthen his hold on the throne of Egypt.",
                    "There is, however, also a positive aspect of what Pharaoh had said now. Why would Joseph have to appeal to Pharaoh now as if he himself did not wield any authority in the country? Had not Pharaoh given Joseph blanket authority at the time he had appointed him as the absolute ruler over his kingdom? When Pharaoh now said to Joseph that his brothers had come to him, he merely reiterated that Joseph <b>did not need</b> to ask any kind of permission. Joseph's authority included the area concerning which he had now asked Pharaoh's permission. We find something analogous in <i>Yuma</i> 4 where Rabbi Mussiah son of Rabbi Menassiah teaches that there is scriptural proof for the assumption that when one reveals information received by a second person even when one had not been sworn to secrecy, this is forbidden unless specific permission has been granted. When G'd spoke to Moses in Leviticus 1,1, He added that Moses should communicate His words by adding the word <span class=\"font1\">לאמור</span>. Accordingly, Pharaoh had to tell Joseph to extend the invitation in his name. Although this diminishes the value of Pharaoh's invitation slightly, it is not materially different from what Pharaoh had said in chapter 45.",
                    "We may also see some additional significance in the word <span class=\"font1\">אליך</span> in verse five. The reason Pharaoh did command the brothers to migrate to Egypt was only in order to demonstrate that Joseph had never been a slave and had been born into a very respectable family. While it was true that on the face of it this had been demonstrated at the time when Joseph revealed himself to his brothers, he had not yet freed himself completely from the suspicion that the \"brothers\" were a group of bachelors with whom Joseph had made a deal that they should claim to be his family. We find that <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 100,9 refers to such a possibility in connection with Genesis 50,21 where Joseph is described as: \"he consoled them and put their minds at ease.\" The <i>Midrash</i> describes that Joseph put his brothers' minds at ease by telling them that if he were to take any punitive action against them now the Egyptians would question his claim that they were his family and would argue that at the time that he, Joseph, identified them as his brothers this had been a charade, and that they had only been a group of young men whom he had paid to misrepresent themselves. When Pharaoh said to Joseph \"your brothers have come to you,\" he meant that the brothers' presence in Egypt would buttress Joseph's claim concerning his ancestry."

If Pharaoh were not to confirm this specifically, Joseph might think that he did not want them to reside in Goshen. If, on the other hand, he were to say only that the brothers should reside in Goshen without adding the words \"in the best part of the land,\" Joseph might feel that Pharaoh only assigned the inferior part of the province of Goshen to them. To avoid any misunderstanding, Pharaoh spelled out that the brothers should reside in the best part of the land of Goshen.

This is why Joseph replied that he was willing to accept their cattle in payment <b>only</b> \"if indeed there is no more money.\" Joseph's reason for all this was to impoverish the Egyptians so that his brothers would not be in an economically inferior position vis-a-vis the Egyptians. Joseph was very clever not to accept any payment other than money as long as there was cash around. As long as the Egyptians still had their livestock they would have to provide fodder for their animals; presumably one effect of the famine was the absence of grazing land. The Egyptians therefore had to feed their livestock with barley. This in turn led to the money supply becoming completely exhausted within a year.

Their argument therefore was: \"why should we die since we have the necessary liquid assets and are only unable temporarily to collect that money?\" Accordingly, Joseph told them that if they really did have money in the form of receivables he was willing to accept their livestock as payment for food in the meantime. The livestock served as collateral for the cash the Egyptians would owe him. As soon as they would collect their receivables he expected them to turn over the money to him."

In practice, these Egyptians became hired hands who were not free to leave their employment. As a result Joseph had to acquire the land separately. This is why the Torah wrote in verse 20 that \"Joseph acquired all the lands on behalf of Pharaoh as each of the Egyptians sold his land, etc.\" This would enable Pharaoh to bring in other labourers to work these fields, whereas he was not able to force the Egyptians who had previously owned those fields to farm them as he did not own those farmers bodily.

This principle has been alluded to in the <i>Zohar</i> 210 on <i>Parshat Balak.</i> The reason given there cannot be applied to Jacob the individual, however, inasmuch as he lived a righteous life at all times.",
                    "We must remember that Jacob strove to attain a very high degree of sanctity, one which is reflected in his name Israel. Spiritual highs are attainable only when one simultaneously frees oneself of such human concerns as pain, anguish, anger, etc. The kind of sanctity Jacob strove for needed to be based on the attainment of a degree of serenity in his earthly life, something that we nowadays experience only on the Sabbath, a day that G'd has imbued with the quality of <span class=\"font1\">מנוחה</span>. He gave us an additional soul in order to appreciate that day to the full, and in order to help us to disregard all the depressing phenomena we have to deal with during the 6 days preceding the Sabbath. The reason we are able to do this is because the <span class=\"font1\">מנוחה</span> emanates in the higher spiritual regions. This is why G'd Himself called the Sabbath <span class=\"font1\">עונג</span>, delight. Whenever Jacob experienced the kind of spiritual serenity we are meant to experience every Sabbath, he qualified for the name Israel. The Torah therefore informs us about all these occasions by referring to him by his additional name. Whenever Jacob experienced worries, etc., this serenity departed from him similar to the departure of the <span class=\"font1\">נשמה יתרה</span> from every Jew at the end of the Sabbath. At such times the Torah reverts to referring to our patriarch as being merely \"Jacob.\"",
                    "I shall make a short list of instances where the respective names of Jacob and Israel clearly reflect different frames of mind of Jacob/Israel. In Genesis 35,10 where G'd tells Jacob for the first time that though his name remains Jacob he will henceforth also be entitled to the name Israel, the reason that G'd emphasised that <b>at that time</b> his name was still Jacob is that he had just heard about the death of his mother Rivkah (compare <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 82, which understands the words: \"He (G'd) blessed him\" in 35,9 as the blessing one extends to mourners). This is why the name Jacob continues to appear throughout this paragraph. The time when Rachel died (immediately afterwards according to the report in the Torah) was also a period during which Jacob could not qualify for the additional name Israel. The Torah (35,20) speaks about Jacob erecting a tombstone on the site where Rachel died and was buried. As soon as the thirty days of mourning had passed, we find that G'd called Jacob \"Israel\" in 35,21 where he is described as continuing his journey towards reunion with his father. When we find Jacob's children referred to as \"the sons of Jacob\" instead of as \"the sons of Israel\" in 35,22, this does not contradict what we have written, as the Torah merely wants to inform us that Israel's children were not on the same spiritual level as their father. The fact that Reuben was guilty of a misdemeanour with Israel's concubine at that time, is clear evidence of that. When the reunion between Isaac and his son Jacob is described in 35,27, the reason that Jacob is not called Israel is simply that it would not be good manners for the son to be called by a name which suggests a higher spiritual level than that of his father Isaac. You will find confirmation of this thought in <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> item 875 on Psalms 116,15 \"that the death of His faithful is precious to the Lord,\" where the author writes: \"if Abraham had been alive at that time, how could his son Isaac have exercised any authority?\" The same argument applied to all the other patriarchs. The above teaches that while one's illustrious father or teacher is alive, the son or disciple is not allowed to outshine him. This is why the Torah refers to Jacob as Jacob at that time. When we read about Jacob settling in the land of Canaan in 37,1 he is again called Jacob to remind us that during all the years he remained in the land of Canaan his life was full of mental anguish with very brief exceptions. One such exception was his relationship with Joseph before the latter was sold into slavery. This is why the Torah speaks of that relationship as \"Israel loved Joseph, etc.\" The name Israel is used by the Torah only three times from the time Joseph was sold until 45,28 after Jacob had regained a measure of Holy Spirit as stated in 45,27 <span class=\"font1\">ותחי רוח יעקב אביהם</span>, \"their father Jacob's <b>spirit</b> revived.\" The three instances during the period between the sale of Joseph and Jacob's receiving the news that he was alive and well are 43,6: \"Israel said: 'why did you harm me,'etc,\"--43,8: \"Yehudah said to Israel his father, etc.\" and 43,11: \"Their father Israel said to them, etc.\" In all those instances Jacob spoke to his sons as a person who exercised his position of authority; this is why the Torah describes him with his full title \"Israel.\" In those instances Jacob/lsrael had to assert his authority when he noticed that his sons did not give due consideration to their father's anguish. By acting as \"Israel\" he indicated that he would not forgive them if they did not heed his words. As soon as Jacob heard the news about Joseph he is referred to repeatedly as the \"Israel\" of old. This situation continues until Jacob/lsrael is told that he has to remain in Egypt, i.e. in exile. From then on the Torah called him Israel only at the moment of his reunion with Joseph or when the Torah referred to his sons. During the period Jacob dwelled in Egypt the Torah generally calls him Jacob until shortly before his death. It was important that his sons and family should remember that they had lost not merely a Jacob but an Israel. Besides, as Jacob prepared for death, his mind became filled with other-worldly concerns. It was therefore easy for him to attain the serenity needed to be Israel once more. The <i>Zohar</i> first section, 218 elaborates on the spiritual growth of the human soul shortly before its death in connection with \"Israel prostrating himself at the head of the bed\" during the period described in the Torah as \"the days approached when Israel was to die,\" (47,29 and 47,31). All of this is the plain meaning of these verses. They do have implications of a more profound and mystical nature, however.",
                    "<b><span class=\"font1\">ויחי יעקב בארץ מצרים</span>, Jacob lived in the land of Egypt, etc.</b> Why did the Torah have to tell us once more that Jacob was in Egypt? Besides, all the Torah had to write was: '<span class=\"font1\">ויהי ימי יעקב וגו</span>, \"Jacob lived to be 147 years old.\" This information would have allowed us to calculate that he lived in Egypt for the last 17 years seeing that he had told Pharaoh that he was 130 years old when he came to Egypt (47,9). Furthermore, why did the Torah have to repeat <span class=\"font1\">שני חייו</span>, the years of his life?",
                    "Perhaps all of this is connected to the fact that Jacob's life was never smooth from the moment of his birth when he held on to the heel of his twin brother. His adversary Esau grew up alongside him; thereafter he lived a life of constant tension with his uncle Laban for 20 years. Not much later he experienced the anguish of Dinah's rape to be followed by Joseph's disappearance. For all these reasons the Torah tells us that the only 17 years Jacob lived a relatively serene life were the last 17 years of his life in Egypt. The Torah underlines that these were the only years which Jacob could really be described as having enjoyed by writing <span class=\"font1\">ויהי ימי יעקב שני חייו</span>, \"these years were full of <span class=\"font1\">חיים</span>, life.\" These 17 years were truly <span class=\"font1\">ימי יעקב</span>, \"Jacob's years.\"",
                    "We have a tradition based on <i>Tana de bey Eliyahu Rabbah</i> chapter 5 that when someone concludes his life on earth in a happy frame of mind his entire life may be considered as having been a happy one. This is also the meaning of Job 8,7: <span class=\"font1\">והיה ראשיתך מצער ואחריתך ישגה מאד</span>, \"though your beginning was full of pain, your end will be a great achievement.\" Solomon has expressed a similar thought in Kohelet 7,8 when he said that \"a good ending is better than a good beginning.\" When the Torah speaks of <span class=\"font1\">ויחי יעקב</span>, this means that the last 17 happy years which Jacob lived in Egypt made his entire life, i.e. <span class=\"font1\">שני חייו</span> appear as years during which he had lived to the full. The Torah chose the word <span class=\"font1\">ויהי</span> which always signifies some painful experience to tell us that though there had been many painful experiences in Jacob's life on earth they were all converted to positive experiences in light of his last seventeen years in Egypt.",
                    "We need to consider why the Torah enumerates the years of Jacob's life in a different manner from the way it enumerated the lives of Abraham and the other patriarchs. When the Torah told us about the number of years Abraham lived, it commenced with the larger unit first, i.e. 100 years plus seventy years plus five years (compare Genesis 25,7). We find the same thing in Genesis 35,28 when Isaac's life is described; the same also is the case when the Torah described the number of years Sarah lived (Genesis 23,1). Perhaps the reason that the Torah reversed this in Jacob's case is to drive home the point that Jacob's last 17 good years were the key to his whole life.",
                    "Perhaps the Torah actually wanted to pinpoint 47 years of Jacob's life as the ones during which he experienced what we are in the habit of calling happiness. This is based on the interpretation of the verse in Genesis 37,3 that <span class=\"font1\">וישראל אהב את יוסף מכל בניו</span>. According to the <i>Zohar</i> both Jacob's love for Rachel his true mate and Joseph is lumped together in this verse as indicated by the extra word <span class=\"font1\">את</span>. As long as Joseph had not been born Jacob dressed in sackcloth [a figure of speech denoting he had not yet begun to experience what he perceived to be his true destiny. Ed.] When computing the number of years Jacob was married to Rachel and the 17 years prior to Joseph's disappearance, one must consider that some of these years overlapped as Rachel was alive until the birth of Benjamin 6 years after the birth of Joseph. Jacob was married to Rachel for 13 years during his stay at Laban. He experienced 11 years in the company of Joseph before the latter was sold making a total of 24 years. When you add to this the 17 years he lived in Egypt you get a total of 41 years of happiness in Jacob's adult life. When you add the first 6 years of Jacob's childhood, years that are not yet clouded by the various problems we experience in life, we have a total of 47 years of Jacob's life during which he could be considered as having lived a \"normal\" life. The Torah may have wanted to draw our attention to this fact and therefore it mentions these 47 years before mentioning the numerically bigger number, i.e. the 100 years.",
                    "According to this approach we have to justify the word <span class=\"font1\">ויהי</span> as a hint by the Torah that Jacob did not exploit all the good years of life on earth he could have enjoyed because he had caused Rachel's premature death when he uttered the oath that anyone who had stolen Laban's Teraphim should not live (31,32). <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 74,9 writes that the reason Jacob did not attain the age of his father Isaac (180), was that he lost 33 years of his life, a number corresponding to the numerical value of the word <span class=\"font1\">יחיה</span> when he had said in 31,32 that the person who stole Laban's teraphim <span class=\"font1\">לא יחיה</span>, should not live.",
                    "We are now left with the task of explaining why the Torah reports on the total of Jacob's years long before he was actually about to die, and before he had called in his sons to give them his last blessing. Perhaps the Torah wanted Jacob (and us) to become aware that he did not have the life expectancy of his father or his grandfather. This may have prompted him to call in his son Joseph order to make him swear that he would bury him in the land of Canaan. The patriarchs were all prophets and Jacob may well have been aware that he had forfeited 33 years of his life by his premature curse. As a result of this foreknowledge he called upon his son Joseph to visit him at that time in order to discuss burial arrangements. ",
                    "If we look for some kind of allusion in the fact that Jacob enjoyed precisely 17 years in Egypt at the expense of his son Joseph who had become the provider of the family, it maybe that this number of years corresponded to the number of years Jacob himself had provided for Joseph before the latter had been sold into slavery by his brothers. It is also interesting that the number 17 is equal to the numerical value of the word <span class=\"font1\">טוב</span>, good. Perhaps the Torah hints that Jacob experienced a repayment of the good he had done for Joseph while the latter grew up, when his son now repaid him with an equal number of years."

                    "Jacob may also have had an indication that his death was close at hand because the <i>Zohar</i> section 1,217 states that thirty days prior to one's death a person's <span class=\"font1\">צלם</span>, divine image, is removed from him.

Although such knowledge is withheld from ordinary people, righteous people do become aware of it as they are aware of most spiritual matters.

It means that every day one of these sparks escapes the body when a person goes to sleep. Such a loss of the spark is not clearly noticed by the soul as something absolute, however; the \"spark\" is merely detached from the main body of the soul and becomes intertwined with the lower form of the soul known as <span class=\"font1\">נפש</span>, life-force. It is an act of kindness by G'd that every \"spark\" which acquired a merit on a particular day through the performance of a <span class=\"font1\">מצוה</span> by the person whom it inhabits is further removed from loss of vitality in spite of the fact that said person may commit sins subsequently thereby producing defective \"sparks.\" Moreover, when the errant person repents his sin G'd enables such sparks to be restored to their original level of vitality. All of this is part of the various ways in which G'd demonstrates His kindness towards us.",
                    "Keeping in mind the <i>Ari zal's</i> statement, we can understand why the complaint against G'd for having shortened man's lifespan after the deluge from around nine hundred years to less than one hundred years nowadays is not justified. Let us use the following parable to illustrate what occurred. A king distributed gems which had been mined in a quarry to various craftsmen in order to fashion from these gems intricate golden jewelry. He urged the various craftsmen to use all their skills to produce superior work and to complete it at a certain date. Different craftsmen were given different amounts of gems in accordance with the king's estimate of their ability to complete the task within the time allotted. When the time arrived for these craftsmen to present the result of their labours to the king, the king found to his dismay that not only had most of them not performed work of acceptable standards, but some of them had actually ruined many of the gems in the process. The king grew angry and killed these craftsmen. He showed the children of these craftsmen what happened to their parents and why, and he urged them not to repeat the mistakes of their parents. When the king handed the new generation of craftsmen gemstones to fashion into jewelry, he allocated to each one only approximately one tenth of the amount of gems he had allocated to the craftsmen of the previous generation. He believed that by making the task less demanding the craftsmen would have a better chance to perform excellent workmanship. ",
                    "The souls G'd allocated to people are the gemstones referred to in the parable. This is the mystical dimension of Genesis 49,24: <span class=\"font1\">משם רועה אבן ישראל</span>, that by means of the instruments placed at our disposal by G'd, i.e. the Torah and the commandments, we have been given the insights to conduct our lives in such a manner that the sparks making up the soul can be strengthened. The <i>Zohar,</i> part one section 82 describes that the condition of the soul is improved in proportion to the performance of good deeds and abstention from sins by the personality it inhabits. This is equivalent to the intricate jewelry described in our parable.",
                    "Originally, G'd assigned great tasks to the antediluvian generations and at the same time equipped them with commensurately greater souls, each one of which consisted of many \"sparks.\" He assigned a single day to each \"spark.\" This is alluded to in Exodus 16,4 when the Torah speaks about people collecting the manna on a daily basis, i.e. <span class=\"font1\">דבר יום ביומו</span>. The word <span class=\"font1\">יום</span> may be understood as <span class=\"font1\">ענף</span>, a branch or sprout of each soul. G'd granted each human being a certain number of days, i.e. He allocated to them approximately 300.000 such gemstones as mentioned in the parable. After the failure which resulted in the deluge, all of this was restructured in order to help us achieve what is expected of us in a lifespan averaging seventy years.",
                    "We have benefited by this change in G'd's allocation of a shorter lifespan in additional ways. For instance, we observe that the process of aging results in people becoming progressively more frail, a process which even includes scholars (of secular disciplines). Infirmity in old age results in a person not being able to carry out fully the tasks allocated to him for each day he lives. While it is true -as our sages say at the end of tractate <i>Kinim</i> -that <b>Torah scholars</b> who have attained old age retain clear minds, the sages were careful with their wording. They stated that the minds of non-scholars decline progressively to such an extent that their minds gradually cease to function properly. It is clear that inasmuch as parts of the soul gradually disappear, the remaining parts of the soul are not up to the task of performing as if they were still whole. The same thing happens to the body so that gradually both body and mind deteriorate to the level of that of a minor.",
                    "With the help of Rabbi Luria's analysis we can also better understand <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 62,2 in which the difference between dying as a young man or dying at a ripe old age is described. Rabbi Yehudah explained: \"when this light (soul) is extinguished by a natural process it is beneficial both for the light and the wick. If, however, it is extinguished by an unnatural process this is harmful both for the light and its wick.\" The <i>Midrash</i> compared the death of an aged person to the gradual extinction of a light. As the light gradually loses power, so the aged person's vital systems (<span class=\"font1\">נפש</span>) decline progressively until finally he dies by appearing like a person who is merely asleep and who does not feel what is happening to him when his last remaining vestige of life leaves him.",
                    "Rabbi Luria's comparison also helps us understand Psalms 104,29: <span class=\"font1\">תוסף רוחם יגועון</span>, \"when you take away their breath they perish.\" The meaning of this statement had not been clear. Besides, one would have expected David to say: <span class=\"font1\">תוסף ברוחם</span>. With the help of Rabbi Luria's introduction the meaning of the verse becomes crystal clear. When the end of man's life approaches and G'd gathers in all the remaining parts of the soul which used to commute to heaven nightly only to return to their bodies by morning, G'd will then collect the soul itself (not just the \"sparks\"). We have already explained elsewhere that the departure of the soul from the body at night is not something absolute; the soul continues to illuminate the body below with its \"light;\" we have proof of this in the well known phenomenon that when one awakens a sleeping person (in the middle of the night) the part of the soul which had ascended heavenwards is immediately perceived as present in the body of the person who has been awakened.",
                    "Having read what Rabbi Luria had to say on the subject of the soul we now appreciate that when the Torah described Jacob's life as drawing to its close by saying: \"the days of Jacob's death approached,\" the meaning is the same as that in Psalms 104,29 except that here the Torah uses the expression <span class=\"font1\">למות</span> instead of <span class=\"font1\">יגועון</span>. The various parts of Jacob's soul which used to ascend nightly were now about to be gathered together for a final journey to heaven. Jacob felt that this process was taking place and this is why he called for Joseph to come and see him.",
                    "<b><span class=\"font1\">ויקרא לבנו ליוסף</span>. \"He called for his son, for Joseph.\"</b> The reason Jacob only called upon Joseph is simple. Only Joseph possessed the power to carry out Jacob's wish to be buried in the cave of Machpelah. We do need to understand, however, why the Torah felt the need to add that Joseph was \"his son;\" do we not know this? Was there another person called Joseph so that we might have erred as to whom Jacob called? Furthermore, why did the Torah not merely write <span class=\"font1\">לבנו יוסף</span>, instead of adding the letter <span class=\"font1\">ל</span> by writing <span class=\"font1\">לבנו ליוסף</span>?",
                    "The Torah may have wanted to explain the strange phenomenon of a commoner summoning the king instead of asking the king for an audience at his palace in the capital. We know that the <i>halachah</i> considers the dignity of a king as taking precedence over the dignity of one's teacher. The Talmud <i>Kidushin</i> 33 discusses the problem of how a father has to conduct himself vis-a-vis his son when the latter is his rabbi. Is the son who is also a rabbi obligated to rise in the presence of his father? Rabbi Yoshua ben Levi there opines that he himself does not need to rise in the presence of his son since he was greater than his son in Torah learning; since, however the son occupied a position of great prominence (he was the son-in-law of the prince (<span class=\"font1\">נשיא</span>) he made a practice of rising in the presence of his son. I have already elaborated on this subject in my book <i>Rishon Letzion</i> (glossaries on the <i>Yore De-ah</i> 240, subsection 7). In any event, it is clear from the discussion in the Talmud that the honour due to the temporal power takes precedence over that due to one's father even if the son was not the temporal authority itself but only closely related to it. In view of this, how could Jacob arrogate to himself the right to summon Joseph to his home? In order to answer this question the Torah provides us with two answers. 1) Inasmuch as Joseph was his son, and 2) inasmuch as he was Joseph. One of these two reasons by itself would not have sufficed to give Jacob the right to summon Joseph. Had Joseph not been Jacob's son, the fact that Joseph loved him would not have been an adequate reason for Jacob to ignore etiquette and summon the king to his side. However, since Joseph did not only love Jacob as such but he was also his father and mentor and Joseph was a <b>dutiful son</b>, Jacob was able to ask him to come to him. The Torah writes <b><span class=\"font1\">לבנו</span></b>, to stress that Joseph was known for his extraordinary devotion to his father. This is why his father knew that he would not stand on ceremony and would ignore etiquette. This in spite of the halachic ruling based on <i>Kidushin</i> 32 that when a king is willing to forego the honour due him he is not allowed to do so. The ruling in the Talmud applies only to a Jewish king who rules over Israel. A king of the type of Joseph is permitted to waive the honour due him if he feels the occasion demands it.",
                    "<b><span class=\"font1\">אם נא מצאתי חן</span>, \"If I have found favour in your eyes, etc.\"</b> The word <span class=\"font1\">נא</span> means both \"please\" and \"now\" in this instance. Jacob used the word in the sense of \"now\" to make Joseph realise that he knew he had already previously found favour in his son's eyes, why else would he have provided for him for the past 17 years. However, he now asked for an additional favour. This is why he said: \"please.\" Had he not said \"please,\" it might have sounded as if he had not been grateful for the sustenance Joseph had provided thus far.",
                    "Alternatively, Jacob indicated that although Joseph would no longer have to provide for him seeing he was about to die, there was another matter concerning which he needed Joseph's favour.",
                    "We may also read a more subtle meaning into this request. All the favours Joseph had done for Jacob in the past could have been interpreted in either of two ways. 1) Joseph did so because Jacob had found favour in his eyes and not because he expected any favours from his father in return. This was normal between a father and a son who were extremely fond of each other. 2) Joseph had done what he did merely because it was his duty as a son to look after his aging father something that is customary also amongst the Gentiles. It would simply have been a disgrace for a man in Joseph's position to make his family a charge on outsiders. Inasmuch as the motivation of Joseph's conduct up to this point had been subject to some doubt, the request Jacob was about to make from him now was one by means of which Joseph could demonstrate that he had done everything <b>only</b> because he loved his father not because he was performing a filial duty. If Joseph were to accede to his request he would prove that all he had done in the past had also been motivated solely by love for his father. Inasmuch as what Jacob asked Joseph to do now was something he was not obligated to do, if he were to decline to do so it would reflect on the motivations behind the favours he had done for his father up to now. This is also why Jacob spoke about <span class=\"font1\">מצאתי</span>, \"I have found,\" instead of <span class=\"font1\">אמצא</span> \"I will find.\"",
                    "<b><span class=\"font1\">שים נא ידך</span>, \"please place your hand, etc.\"</b> In this instance the word <span class=\"font1\">נא</span> may mean \"please,\" or it may mean \"now\" in the sense of \"after due consideration.\" Jacob added a second request to the one he had already indicated he was about to make that he be buried in the land of Canaan, namely that Joseph reinforce his promise by swearing an oath. The word also meant that Jacob was not content to wait until his death was imminent for Joseph to make this undertaking. He wanted the undertaking to be made on that very day. The fact that the next paragraph begins with the words: \"it was after these events,\" makes it quite plain that the conversation the Torah reports here took place some considerable time before Jacob took ill (48,1) and Joseph was told about it by a third party (48,2). Jacob also wanted Joseph to render this oath immediately, before he had an opportunity to register a <span class=\"font1\">מודעה</span>, a statement that the oath his father requested from him was to be considered as something he had committed himself to only under duress and should therefore not be binding upon him. <i>Midrash Tanchuma</i> even says that Jacob told Joseph that unless he swore an oath to him concerning this burial, he would die from mere worry that he would not be buried in the cave of Machpelah. If that was so, Joseph had additional reason to register a <span class=\"font1\">מודעה</span>. Jacob therefore had to pre-empt such a possibility by insisting on an immediate and therefore irrevocable oath. All this is implied by the words: <span class=\"font1\">שים נא ידך</span>, \"put your hand <b>now</b>, etc.\"",
                    "<b><span class=\"font1\">ועשית עמדי חסד ואמת</span>, \"and do me a true favour!\"</b> The Torah added the conjunctive letter <span class=\"font1\">ו</span> at the beginning of the word <span class=\"font1\">ועשית</span> to indicate that the request for the oath had preceded the actual request to bury him in the land of Canaan.",
                    "<i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 96,5 teaches that any favour performed for a person after his death is considered a \"true favour.\" This is very difficult to understand as we observe Jacob promising Joseph an extra share in the land of Israel at the time the land would be distributed when he said: \"I am giving you one portion more than your brothers which I took from the Emorites with my sword and my bow (48,22).\" Rashi even explains that Jacob said: \"because you have the bother to organise my burial, etc, I assign to you an extra share in the land of Israel, namely <span class=\"font1\">שכם</span>.\" The fact that Jacob said <span class=\"font1\">נתתי</span>, \"I have given,\" indicates that he did so at the time when he had made Joseph swear the oath which he had categorised as <span class=\"font1\">חסד ואמת</span> in 47,29 at the time Joseph accepted the task to bury his father. We may have to conclude that Jacob meant to reward Joseph already at that time for accepting the task to organise the funeral procession all the way to the land of Canaan and not for the burial in the cave of Machpelah itself. Even if this were correct, Jacob should not have added the word \"<span class=\"font1\">ואמת</span>.\"",
                    "On the other hand, Jacob may have intended that Joseph should arrange matters in such a way that the fact that his father had awarded him an extra piece of territory should not be perceived by him as a payment for such a deed. This could be achieved by one of two means. 1) He asked Joseph not to bury him in a town filled with abominations, i.e. <span class=\"font1\">אל נא תקברני במצרים</span>; <span>2)</span> Joseph should transfer his earthly remains to the Holy Land. The <span class=\"font1\">חסד</span>, kindness, Joseph was to perform was <b>not</b> to bury his father in Egypt; the normal sequence of death and burial is that one dies first and then one is buried. It is significant that Jacob first spoke about where he <b>did not want to be buried,</b> and only afterwards mentioned a word associated with dying when he said: \"I wish to lie with my fathers.\" This indicates clearly that the oath Jacob made Joseph swear referred to where he was going to be buried, not to where he was not to be buried. Joseph would not receive a reward for either of these two requests so that what he did could be described as a true kindness. The extra town Jacob allocated to Joseph's (his tribe's) heritage in the land of Israel was only in respect of the effort and expense involved in transporting the remains of his father to the land of Canaan.",
                    "The verse may also be understood along the following lines: When Jacob said: <span class=\"font1\">ועשית</span>, he meant that what Joseph had already done for him in the past was a <span class=\"font1\">חסד של אמת</span>, a true kindness for which he had not and would not receive compensation. There was, however, another kindness Jacob would now ask of him for which he would receive the city of Shechem as a reward. We would then have to understand the letter <span class=\"font1\">ו</span> in front of the word <span class=\"font1\">ועשית</span> as referring also to what Joseph would do in the future. Once Joseph undertook to carry out his father's wish in return for compensation any oath he swore that he would do so could not be construed as an oath sworn under duress. There would be no legal way Joseph could become free from that oath except by carrying out its provisions (compare Rav Nissim on Nedarim 65). Although the text does not have Jacob mention the gift of Shechem at this point, the Torah does give a broad hint that Jacob had promised Shechem to Joseph already prior to 48,22 when the Torah makes mention of it. Jacob is not reported as saying that he would give that city to Joseph in the future, but the Torah reports him as saying: \"I have already given you one portion more than to your brothers.\" The gift had been bestowed on Joseph at the time Jacob asked Joseph to render an oath concerning Jacob's burial arrangements in 47,30-31. We have explained the legal details about revocable and irrevocable oaths in connection with Isaac and Avimelech; see our commentary on Genesis 26,26. We must also remember <i>Sotah</i> 36 where it is stated that eventually Joseph had to threaten Pharaoh that he would consider himself free of his undertaking not to reveal that Pharaoh did not understand Hebrew unless the latter would let him honour his oath to his father to bury him in the land of Canaan. Joseph's argument there does not imply that he was <b>legally</b> able to renege on the oath to his father, he only used that argument to put the oath to his father on the same legal basis as that which he had rendered to Pharaoh, seeing that in both instances he had received compensation for rendering the oath.",
                    "<b><span class=\"font1\">אל נא תקברני במצרים</span>, \"please do not bury me in Egypt.\"</b> The meaning of the words <span class=\"font1\">אל נא</span> in this case refers to a time-frame. Jacob did not even want to be interred in Egypt temporarily. He wanted that his remains be transferred to the land of Canaan immediately. This is why he added <span class=\"font1\">ושכבתי עם אבותי</span>, \"I wish to lie with my fathers,\" adding <span class=\"font1\">ונשאתני</span> \"and you will transport me, etc.\" I have already explained the reason that Jacob had first said \"do not bury me, etc.\" and only afterwards: \"I wish to lie with my fathers, etc.\" on 47,29: \"perform a favour for me.\" The <i>Zohar</i> Vayeshev 182 explains that Jacob and Joseph were so much part of the same category of souls and that this is why Jacob was afraid that when the time came for him to die, Joseph would not want to be separated from him until he himself would die. Although the Talmud <i>Taanit</i> 4 claims that Jacob did not die and remained alive, Jacob wanted to be sure that Joseph did not misunderstand this and that he realised that his father would \"die.\" When that occurred he would be separated from Joseph and would want to join his fathers. This is why he had to issue all these instructions."

All he had to do was to place his hand where his father had asked and make the promise and that would be his reply to his father's request. This is what Eliezer did when Abraham made him swear an oath concerning his selecting a wife for Isaac (Genesis 24,9).",
                    "Actually, the Torah mentions Joseph's declaration as proof that he said he did not need to swear an oath, that his promise was sufficient.",
                    "Alternatively, he meant that he was legally obligated to comply with his father's request either by dint of being his father's son or by dint of his father's request being that of a man about to die (compare <i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 252,2).

He may have meant simply that he wanted Joseph to humour him and to phrase his promise in the form of an oath, or he may have said so without revealing his true motivation at all but making it clear that he had some reason he did not want to reveal. The reason, of course, was to give Joseph ammunition in case someone would try to prevent him from doing what he had promised.

After all it appears from G'd's promise in 35,11 that Jacob was to produce <b>two</b> more tribes, not just one more tribe? Where do we have an indication that the name Joseph as a tribe would be eliminated or superseded? Besides, who told Jacob that the two additional children G'd promised him in 35,11 were to be the two sons of Joseph rather than two sons of another one of his children? Was it not more likely for Jacob to assume that the two additional children G'd had in mind were Peretz and Zerach, the children of the union of Yehudah and Tamar, truly superior children as we know from the fact that dynasties were descended from them?",
                    "Perhaps Jacob thought G'd that must have referred to Joseph's children as He had already alluded to the role of Yehudah's children when He had told him that kings would be descended from him in the same verse i.e. <span class=\"font1\">ומלכים מחלציך יצאו</span>. However, why do we have to assume that these words referred to the <b>sons</b> of Yehudah rather than that the <span class=\"font1\">גוי וקהל גוים</span> themselves would be the kings? Besides, there was always the possibility that G'd had referred to the sons of another one of Jacob's sons.",

The <i>Zohar</i> section 1 item 180 claims that the <span class=\"font1\">נפש</span> of Jacob and Joseph were closely intertwined and that we have proof of this in Psalms 77,16 where the sons of Jacob and Joseph are almost equated by the use of a conjunctive letter <span class=\"font1\">ו</span> by the psalmist to show how close these two were to one another. Kabbalists describe that letter <span class=\"font1\">ו</span> as <span class=\"font1\">מלוי הוי׳ו</span>, i.e. that the <span class=\"font1\">מלוי</span> is equivalent to the word itself. [In other words, Joseph equals Jacob because the psalmist joined his name to Jacob by means of this letter <span class=\"font1\">ו</span>. Ed.] In this way Joseph became a \"founding father\" (patriarch) of tribes. Once we accept this, it was easy for Jacob to realise that of all his sons only his son Joseph was endowed with the ability to be a founding father of the tribes. When G'd had told Jacob that he would beget still more sons, this promise could therefore just as easily have been meant to apply to Joseph having these sons. As a result, Jacob had no reason at all to consider that prophecy as applicable to any of his other sons.",

It is true that Rashi based on <i>Midrash Lekach Tov</i> explains that Jacob wanted to explain to Joseph why he had imposed upon him the difficult and tedious task of burying him in the land of Canaan while he himself had not buried Rachel in the cave of Machpelah which was much closer to the site of her death than Egypt from Machpelah. If that had been the Torah's purpose in writing this then it should have appeared in conjunction with 47,30 rather than here. Besides, what did Jacob mean when he said <span class=\"font1\">עלי</span>, \"she died on me?\"",
                    "Actually, having told Joseph that G'd had told him that he would have more children himself, Jacob now explained to Joseph that it was his own fault that this did not happen as Rachel had died prematurely because of his negligence by delaying to honour the vow he had made after the dream of the ladder. This is the meaning of <span class=\"font1\">מתה עלי</span>, \"she died on my account.\" The words <span class=\"font1\">ואני בבאי</span> refer to the promised additional children not being physical issue of Jacob but that Joseph's children were the incarnation of that promise. <i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 37,1 tells us that if someone makes a vow and is tardy in keeping it he is punished by having to bury his wife. Jacob's saying <span class=\"font1\">ואני בבאי מפדן מתה עלי רחל</span> is quoted as the source for this statement. Alternatively, Jacob may have referred to his rash curse of \"anyone who has stolen Laban's teraphim shall not live\" which he made without knowing that Rachel had been the thief. In either event, had Rachel remained alive Jacob himself would have sired the additional sons G'd had promised to him in 35,11.",
                    "It is also possible that Jacob intended to placate Joseph for having been instrumental in hastening his mother's death. He told him that the reason he considered Joseph's two sons as if they were equal to Reuben and Shimon was in expiation for having caused Rachel's death at the time. He added that although he buried Rachel <span class=\"font1\">בעוד כברת ארץ</span>, \"a tract of land away, (and had not buried her in the cave of Machpelah),\" he asked Joseph to go to the trouble of burying him there."

This is homiletics, of course. We need to be able to explain the plain meaning of the verse also, and this is why the Torah reveals here that Jacob's eyesight had begun to fail him so that he could not see clearly and recognise people. Hence, although Jacob was aware that in addition to Joseph with whom he was speaking two other human beings were standing in front of him, he had recognised Joseph because he had been told in verse 2 that Joseph had come to visit him. He did not recognise Joseph's sons, however, and this is why he asked who they were.",

Jacob too accorded Joseph's sons greater powers of reproduction when he blessed them by comparing their fruitfulness to that of fish.

This need arose only because Jacob's blessing had been fulfilled and they had multiplied at a faster rate than the other tribes. <i>Berachot</i> 55 sees in Jacob's phraseology a hint that the descendants of Joseph would be immune to the evil eye just as the fish are immune to the evil eye.

Furthermore, why did he appear to repeat himself by describing Reuben as 1) \"my strength,\" and 2) \"the first of my vigor?\" Another difficulty in this verse is the expression <span class=\"font1\">יתר שאת ויתר עז</span>. Whereas the <i>Midrash</i> we have just referred to understands the word <span class=\"font1\">שאת</span> as a reference to the Priesthood whereas the word <span class=\"font1\">עז</span> is a reference to Royalty, we need to know why Jacob did not mention that as a firstborn Reuben was entitled to two portions in the inheritance seeing that he did dwell on details of the birthright. Onkelos does refer to this by saying that Jacob meant that Reuben should have been entitled to three shares of the inheritance. Another enigmatic statement in this verse (4) is the expression <span class=\"font1\">פחז כמים אל־תותר</span>, \"unstable as water, you have lost your advantage;\" Rashi comments that Reuben lost his advantage as a firstborn because of his instability, the instability being that he defiled Jacob's bed in the incident with Bilhah (35,22). This still does not tell us why Jacob could not have merely said <span class=\"font1\">אל תותר</span>, without describing Reuben as <span class=\"font1\">פחז כמים</span>. After all, Reuben's instability was only an additional way of describing his sin. All we needed to know to justify that Reuben was deprived of his privileges as the firstborn was the fact that he had committed a sin against his father. Why did Jacob phrase Reuben's sin in the plural, i.e. \"your father's <b>beds</b>?\" Why did Jacob create the impression that Reuben had committed two wrongs when he said: <span class=\"font1\">אז חללת</span>, \"<b>at that time</b> you defiled,\" as if Reuben had also defiled his bed at a different time? It gives the impression that the defilement Jacob speaks about did not occur at the time Reuben mounted his father's bed. If that is so we are entitled to know what precisely Jacob is talking about. On the other hand, if mounting his father's bed was defiling it he should have said so in unmistakable terms.",
                    "Before commencing to explain these verses we need to understand why Jacob did not honour the Torah's commandment of not showing preference (in terms of inheritance) to the firstborn son of the wife he loved when the true firstborn was the son of the wife he hated (Deut. 21,16)? Jacob treated Joseph the firstborn son of his beloved wife Rachel, as entitled to the privileges that are accorded to the son of the wife he hated when the latter had been born earlier. The question also arises whether the patriarchs were obligated to accept the norms of the Torah, seeing that the Torah did not become the law of Israel until the revelation at Mount Sinai. After all, we find that Jacob married two sisters while both were alive, something that contravenes Torah law. Abraham too did not perform circumcision on himself until he was advanced in years whereas Torah law stipulates circumcision on the eighth day or as soon as possible thereafter. We can find numerous other instances of the patriarchs not acting in accordance with Torah law. In view of the two examples we have quoted about the patriarchs not complying with what became Torah law thereafter, the whole question of why Jacob treated Joseph as his firstborn seems irrelevant. I have found that Nachmanides (Genesis 26,5) explains that the reason Jacob did marry two sisters while both were alive was that he was not in the Holy Land at the time. His words do not sound convincing. Who told Jacob that Torah legislation applied only within the boundaries of <span class=\"font1\">ארץ ישראל</span>? The fact is that the commandments which the patriarchs did not observe apply equally in <span class=\"font1\">ארץ ישראל</span> and outside it.",
                    "I believe that the patriarchs received the Torah from Shem who in turn had received it from Noach; Noach had received it from Chanoch who had received it from Adam himself. Adam, of course, had received the Torah from G'd. This is based on Job 28,27: \"Then He saw and told, etc.,…and He said to Adam.\" <i>Zohar</i> 1,199 attributes the revelation of Torah laws to Adam as the basis of G'd instructing him how to work and preserve the <span class=\"font1\">גן עדן</span>. I have explained this in connection with Genesis 2,15. At that time Adam (and the patriarchs subsequently) were only commanded seven laws on pain of death. These laws are the ones commonly known as the Noachide laws, those applicable to mankind as a whole. All the other commandments which G'd revealed to Adam had only one purpose, namely to enable man to accumulate reward if he observed them. If he failed to observe those laws he was not liable to punishment. This situation continued until G'd revealed Himself to the Jewish people at Mount Sinai.",
                    "The patriarchs made a point of observing all these commandments as an expression of their love for G'd. This is what G'd had told Isaac in Genesis 26,5. <i>Yuma</i> 28 states that Abraham not only observed all the commandments of the Torah but even such Rabbinic ordinances as <i>Eyruv Tavshilim.</i> No doubt Abraham instructed his children in these matters as he wanted them to qualify for the reward in store for those who observed all these commandments. Whenever the patriarchs observed that by not observing one of these commandments they would achieve something important immediately, they decided to opt for the immediate benefit. This is what happened when Jacob decided to marry Rachel in addition to Leah. He wanted to have children by Rachel, i.e. that at least some of the tribes should be her offspring. Jacob was especially entitled to do so since he was a prophet and acted in accordance with instructions received from G'd directly. We can understand this better when comparing what Maimonides wrote in chapter 9 of his <i>Hilchot Yesodey Torah.</i> He states that if a properly accredited prophet instructs the Jewish people to violate one of the Torah's commandments on a temporary basis, he is to be obeyed. Maimonides quotes the incident when Elijah rebuilt a private altar and sacrificed on it on Mount Carmel as a case in point. The same applied to Jacob's having married two sisters. According to <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 85,8, an angel exploited Yehudah's desire to have sexual intercourse by guiding him to Tamar, thereby ensuring that the kings who would come out of him had a matriarch who was both of suitable ancestry and of high moral calibre. At any rate, there are instances when it was obviously preferable not to apply the strictures that would become anchored in law at a later time in Jewish history.",
                    "According to what we have said so far we must assume that the fact that Jacob used Reuben's misdeameanour to deprive him of the privileges which come with the birthright was quite legal, halachically speaking. Alternatively, Jacob had received instructions from G'd directly concerning this. We have all of this spelled out in Chronicles I 5,1 where the fact that Reuben was deprived of his birthright because he had mounted his father's bed is stated clearly, although it also states that though Ephrayim and Menashe became the new firstborns, they did not replace Reuben as the titular first-born. ",
                    "It is still not clear why the birthright was not given to Yehudah instead of to Joseph or any of the other older brothers. The <i>Zohar</i> on Vayishlach page 176 explains this. \"At the time when Jacob slept with Leah (the first night of his marriage), he thought only about Rachel all the time since he was under the impression that he was sleeping with and impregnating Rachel. Restoring the birthright to Joseph was no more than an example of Jacob's original intention being fulfilled.\"",
                    "Whereas this explained why Jacob gave the birthright to Joseph once he took it away from Reuben, why did the Torah have to mention that Reuben had defiled Jacob's bed? The birthright would have belonged to Joseph anyways. [I confess I have great difficulty with this <i>Zohar</i> because Leah was not impregnated on the first night of her marriage; when Reuben was conceived, eventually, Jacob was well aware that he was sleeping with Leah. If he had pined after Rachel knowing that he was sleeping with Leah this would have been most inappropriate. Ed.] In order to answer our problem we must remember that all the manifestations of spirituality in the world are divided into three categories. One category of spirituality is sacred, holy. A second category is secular; the third category of spirituality is evil. Each one of these categories produces \"offsprings\" corresponding to its nature. The category of holy spirituality produces offspring which is good, provides eternal bliss, and it strives for abstract intelligence, etc. The category of secular spirituality is characterised by its interest in the consumption of that which is aestethically pleasing, and that which provides enjoyment for the senses. The third category of spirituality is characterised by its interest in idolising every abomination. Its adherents commit every sin in the book. They steal, cheat, deceive, and consume mostly forbidden foods. They engage in illicit sex and indulge only in gratifying their lust, etc. These three categories between them comprise every human being, the good ones, the secular oriented ones, and the evil ones.",
                    "Inasmuch as the Jewish people belong to the holy category of spirituality, G'd has commanded them not to taste i.e. absorb things which characterise evil, be it in the form of food or drink, speech or thought, or even perceptions that are of a visual, aural or of an olfactory nature. Prohibited foods (i.e. the sense of taste) comprise such things as eating living tissue, eating unclean animals, eating reptiles and insects or diseased animals, or even animals which died a natural death. Forbidden drink includes the consumption of wine designated for idolatrous purposes, wine made from grapes of vines which are less than four years old, etc. Forbidden speech includes lying, slander, coarse language, character assassination, etc. Forbidden thoughts include the study of idolatry with a view to practicing it, fantasies of an erotic nature, considering oneself superior to others, pride, etc. Forbidden use of one's vision include examining a woman's physical beauty, as elaborated on in the <i>Zohar</i> Kedoshim page 83. Forbidden sounds include listening to women sing, etc. Forbidden smells and fragrances include forbidden smells such as the incense offered in pagan rites. In all these matters there are secular as well as sacred elements. G'd decreed that it was mandatory to observe the sacred elements whereas it was permitted to take advantage of the secular elements. Whenever a person associates himself with one of either of these elements by making use of them, his soul forms some kind of attachment with the root underlying such element be it positive or negative.",
                    "Seeing that this is so even a pure soul is subject to some degree of contamination when its owner gets involved in one of the secular elements. As a result, such a person (body as well as soul) will experience a process of afflictions either in this world or by the soul alone in the Hereafter to cleanse him of that contamination. This is the mystical dimension of the \"laundry\" mentioned in <i>Shabbat</i> 152 where the soiled souls are described as being handed over to the \"washer\" after death before they can take their seat at the king's table. During the period the \"clothes\" are being washed their owners are incarcerated. You should appreciate that once a forbidden category of spirituality has made contact with a person, that person's soul in turn develops a yearning for that particular category of the forbidden. The attraction between them is mutual. When a soul (personality) has become infected with the impurity represented by adultery, such a soul will begin to develop a yearning for this kind of impurity. The same holds true of all other categories of the forbidden. A person's desire to partake of evil increases in direct proportion to the quantity of evil he has absorbed and the frequency with which he has done so. On the other hand, a person's path to saintliness is similarly accelerated in proportion to the efforts he makes to distance himself from evil and to embrace only what is sacred and holy. The rule one must remember is that there is nothing in this world which does not contain elements of either negative or positive spirituality. Our only yardstick for knowing what contains negative spirituality is that which is forbidden by the Torah. In his volume <i>Sefer Hayashar</i> chapter 9, Rabbeynu Tam writes that when examining a number of personalities (<span class=\"font1\">נפש</span>) as to their inherent tendencies, one will find that some people have absolutely no inclinations to commit adultery whereas others have. The difference is accounted for by the owners of these respective personalities having absorbed negative spirituality. Once a sufficient amount of such evil has been absorbed it is almost impossible for that personality to hate evil sufficiently for that hatred to be of assistance in combating evil tendencies. This is the mystical dimension of what we are taught in <i>Sukkah</i> 52 that man possesses a relatively small organ (male organ) whose demands grow in proportion to the freedom one grants it to satisfy its desire and which becomes progressively more satiated in proportion to the frequency with which it is denied its desire.",
                    "There are people who display a strong tendency towards evil, a tendency which intensifies as they grow up, whereas others can control their evil urges with ease and are able to repent and find their way back to innocence with relative ease. Such tendencies are the result of the composition of their respective life-force at the time of conception. The holy thoughts and aspirations of the parents at the time of marital intercourse determine to a large degree the natural tendencies which we will observe in their offspring. If a parent concentrated on physical gratification at the time he engaged in procreation, he cannot be surprised if he transmitted tendencies of the desire to fulfil himself sexually to his offspring. If at the time the father indulged in marital relations with his wife he fantasized about some other woman's body, he cannot be surprised if his offspring develops adulterous or promiscuous tendencies. [This concept is not dissimilar to present-day theories about the genetic material injected into the sperm determining the quality of the body. In this case we speak about \"moral\" genetical material. Ed.] We have an interesting story about this in the <i>Eyn Yaakov</i> on <i>Berachot</i> 10. King Chiskiyah had failed to marry having seen with his mental eye that his offspring would not be worthy. He fell sick, and Isaiah told him to make his last will and testament as he was going to die. When he challenged the prophet why death at such an early age had been decreed upon him the prophet accused him of failing to fulfil the first commandment of the Torah, to procreate. He did not accept Chiskiyah's reason for not marrying and told him that the worthiness of his children was G'd's concern, whereas his only concern should have been to keep G'd's commandment. In the course of the conversation Chiskiyah suggested to Isaiah that he should give him his daughter in marriage and that perhaps their combined merits would suffice to produce worthy children. After refusing initially, Isaiah agreed in the end. The result was that Chiskiyah produced two idol-worshipping sons Menashe and Ravshakeh. Menashe and Ravshakeh may have been born with idolatrous tendencies due to thoughts which their father had entertained at the time he begat them. If one observes a person who has always conducted himself in the most pious manner commit an obvious sin, one must assume that he was not aware that he committed such a sin. Our argument that the various manifestations of spirituality we encounter contain both positive and negative elements is best proven by the tree of knowledge. The fact that G'd planted that tree within <span class=\"font1\">גן עדן</span> is proof that it contained positive elements. G'd's garden is certainly not a place in which He had planted evil incarnate. <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 21, claims that if only Adam had waited till nightfall before eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge he could have used the juice to proclaim the sanctification of the Sabbath with it. [I have not found this in the section of the <i>Midrash</i> quoted. I presume this is based on the prohibition applying only \"on the <b>day</b> you eat from it,\" as opposed to \"the <b>night</b> you eat from it,\" etc. Ed.] This is in accordance with the view expressed in <i>Sanhedrin</i> 70 that the tree of knowledge was the grapevine.",
                    "In view of all the above you are bound to ask how it was possible that sainted patriarchs such as Abraham and Isaac could have fathered such sons as Ishmael and Esau respectively? The answer is that they carried within themselves residual evil bequeathed to them by their forefather Terach who was an idol worshiper. When Abraham was born he contained elements of such tendencies. Abraham was able to suppress and isolate such tendencies by dint of his character; the residue of such suppressed tendencies resurfaced in Ishmael, however. Nonetheless Abraham was not yet totally free from the residual evil tendencies bequeathed to him by his father so that even Isaac was born with them. Isaac, in turn, suppressed them and isolated them by means of his enthusiastic pursuit of holiness. He was so successful in this regard that our sages in <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 63,8 state that Esau had to be born first so that by absorbing the residue of negative spiritual input remaining from earlier ancestors, Jacob could emerge free from such taint.",
                    "Let us now examine what happened when Jacob married. Since he was born <b>without</b> negative spiritual residue, why did he produce a Reuben who demonstrated some negative traits? This could only have been due to Jacob's thoughts at the time he conceived Reuben not having been perfect. Jacob's purity of thought and his deed were not perfectly matched at that moment. Our sages in <i>Nedarim</i> 20 list nine categories of children who are spiritually defective from the time of their conception; one of these categories is the child of a man who has two wives and who at the time of marital relations believed that he was in bed with his other wife. Although Jacob's situation was different in that he had every reason to believe that he was in bed with Rachel, the objective fact was that he did not have the correct thoughts at the time. This is proven by the fact that Reuben later became guilty of a misdemeanour involving his father's bed, something that not one of the other eleven sons of Jacob ever became guilty of. Even Joseph who was exposed to sexual harassment of a very intense nature did not succumb. While it is true that the Talmud in <i>Shabbat</i> 55 states that if someone accuses Reuben of having committed a transgression such a person is in error, this referred merely to the legal aspect of the matter, not to its moral implications.",
                    "As to Yehudah sleeping with Tamar- something which suggests something less than 100% chaste behaviour by a son of Jacob- there are two answers. 1) First of all, he had no idea that she was his daughter-in-law; 2) the fact that an angel arranged things in such a way that he was actually acting under some kind of duress as explained by our sages in <i>Makkot</i> 23 on Genesis 38,26. The word <span class=\"font1\">ממני</span> in that verse is understood by our sages as referring to a heavenly voice which claimed that the whole incident had been engineered by heaven. Since we do not have an allusion to such heavenly intervention in the case of Reuben, we are entitled to blame him for his act.",
                    "I have seen a comment by the outstanding scholar Rabbi Yehudah Rosenis in his volume <i>Parshat D'rachim</i> in which he comes to the defence of Reuben claiming that the status of Bilhah was that of a woman who had been seduced by his father Jacob, something he derives from her description as \"his father's concubine.\" This means that Bilhah had never been betrothed to Jacob; l cannot agree with this. I am convinced that Jacob acquired Bilhah by betrothing her to him in the traditional manner as l have explained at the appropriate place (Genesis 30,3). As to the term \"concubine\" used by the Torah in 35,22, perhaps that was what Reuben thought. He was in error, however, and that may have accounted for his conduct. Alternatively, the Torah hinted at the reason that Reuben disturbed his father's bed. He argued that not only had Jacob down-graded his mother Leah during Rachel's lifetime, the fact that he slept primarily in Bilhah's tent now that Rachel was dead was an even greater insult to his mother. Her place had now been usurped by a mere concubine. The facts of the matter are that Bilhah had always been a proper wife of Jacob; this is why the Torah describes Reuben's action as equivalent to having slept with one of Jacob's wives.",
                    "Having said all this we understand the words of the <i>Zohar</i> according to which the cause of the problem was that Jacob had thought of fathering his firstborn son Joseph at the time he was sleeping with Leah. This is precisely what Ezra had in mind when he described Reuben's losing his birthright in the Book of Chronicles I 5,1. Had Jacob been thinking of Leah at the time he slept with her, Reuben would never have been capable of the deed ascribed to him.",
                    "We are now able to explain the various verses beautifully. When Jacob was about to deprive Reuben of his birthright he was poignantly aware that if one of his sons had displayed such a moral weakness he had to look for the source of that weakness in something he himself had been guilty of. The cause was, as we explained, that the father had bequeathed to his son some spiritual values be they positive or negative. Inasmuch as Reuben's sin consisted of a sexual aberration, Jacob was anxious to distance himself from the accusation that he was a contributory cause to Reuben's behaviour. He was afraid that in his heart Reuben would accuse his father of being the cause that he was capable of such a mistake. This is why he said first: \"Reuben you are my firstborn.\" People who are guilty of adulterous behaviour fall into 3 categories. 1) They commit adultery and as a result father children who are morally inferior. 2) They commit adultery but do not cause their partner to become pregnant. Such intercourse can again be subdivided into several categories such as intercourse with a married woman which fortuitously does not result in that woman becoming pregnant. Alternatively, the adulterous male engages in intercourse with another male, or he ejaculates outside his female partner. Finally, he might commit the \"act\" only in an erotic dream at night, accidentally. 3) A person arouses himself by means of erotic thoughts. All of the afore-mentioned are degrees of actions which are abhorrent to G'd. Jacob referred to all three alternatives by saying to Reuben: \"my firstborn,\" \"my strength,\" \"my vigor.\" When he said <b><span class=\"font1\">בכודי אתה</span></b>, \"you are my firstborn,\" he meant that he had not fathered any child prior to Reuben. Neither had he slept with a woman without benefit of betrothal and marriage certificate as this also would not have been appropriate. He then continued to say <span class=\"font1\">כחי</span>, \"my strength,\" meaning that he had not emitted sperm previous to that occasion. When he continued: <b><span class=\"font1\">ראשית אוני</span></b>, \"the first of my strength,\" he meant that he had never done anything that could be subsumed under any of the headings of adulterous behaviour we have listed.",
                    "When Jacob said <span class=\"font1\">כחי וראשית אוני</span>, he also hinted that Reuben was the result of the first drop of semen he had ever ejaculated. This is an indication that Jacob had not slept with a virgin, as a virgin could not have become pregnant from her first intercourse. Instead, Jacob had removed the hymen with his finger in order not to let a single drop of his semen go to waste deliberately. This was a further indication that his physical passion did not dominate him and that he did what he did as a sacred duty only. As a result, Reuben had absolutely no reason to blame Jacob's past conduct for any of his own shortcomings. Jacob told Reuben all this not in order to boast about his piety and self-control but in order to be sure that Reuben did not suspect him of being implicated <b>in any way</b> in his having defiled his father's bed.",
                    "Jacob added the words <span class=\"font1\">יתר שאת ויתר עז</span> as an allusion to the double portion of his father's inheritance that the firstborn is entitled to. Jacob had referred to this when he said: \"you are my firstborn.\" On the other hand, there are other distinctions such as the priesthood and royalty which are not necessarily tied to being the firstborn. There are occasions when such honours are bestowed on people who are not firstborn. Reuben had also forfeited the chance to receive such honours.",
                    "Jacob may also have been telling Reuben that the honours of priesthood and Royalty which he would have been entitled to more than any other firstborn and which far outweighed other hereditary advantages of the firstborn he had also forfeited by his behaviour.",
                    "Up until this point Jacob dealt with the fact that he himself had not been at fault in the matter. From this point on Jacob proceeds to list the reasons that Reuben forfeited the privileges which come with being a firstborn. He deals with the distinctions Reuben has forfeited as well as with the roots of the mistake he committed."

                    "<b> <span class=\"font1\">פחז במים</span>, \"Hasty, like water, etc.\"</b> Jacob accused Reuben of acting with haste, not trying to control his emotions and urges, failing to vanquish the spark of evil which was rooted within him. As a result of that failure he would be deprived of the three distinctions we have described i.e. birthright, priesthood and royalty.",
                    "When Jacob added <span class=\"font1\">אל תותר</span>, he hinted that although Reuben had displayed haste in doing something which held no advantage for him, he had not displayed the same haste when it came to doing something useful, i.e. repenting his mistake. Our sages in <i>Baba Kama</i> 92 say that it was Yehudah who triggered Reuben's eventual repentance. Although <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 84,19 states that G'd complimented Reuben on being the first human being who had repented [without having been accused by anyone as yet, Ed.], Reuben had not uttered a confession of his sin until he had heard about Yehudah doing this during Tamar's trial. Perhaps Reuben's tardiness in confessing his mistake was the reason that royalty was conferred on the descendants of Yehudah instead. It was Yehudah's reward for being the cause that triggered the final stage in Reuben's repentance. Reuben may have lost the priesthood to the descendants of Levi as a result of later developments as mentioned in Deut. 33,8 <span class=\"font1\">לאיש חסידך אשר נסיתו במסה</span>, \"Be with Your faithful one whom You tested at Massah\" (when that tribe did not complain). Regardless of when Levi qualified for the priesthood, Reuben forfeited his claim to it already during Jacob's time. The words <span class=\"font1\">אל תותר</span> mean that Reuben was deprived of all his erstwhile advantages over his brothers. Jacob transferred one of his former distinctions to Joseph, a second one to Yehudah, and he left the third one pending until G'd eventually accorded it to part of the tribe of Levi.",
                    "Jacob said <b><span class=\"font1\">כי עלית</span></b> to explain how it was possible that a son of his could commit such an act. He hinted that at the time (the wedding night) his thoughts had been confused as he had been under the impression that he had married and was sleeping with Rachel. In other words, he had actually slept in two beds, physically he had shared Leah's bed, whereas mentally he had considered himself in bed with Rachel. This is the reason Jacob spoke about Reuben having mounted <span class=\"font1\">משכבי אביך</span>, the beds (pl) of your father. This was the original cause of Reuben eventually becoming guilty of his misdemeanour. When Jacob added the word <span class=\"font1\">אז</span>, then, he indicated that the true defilement took place <b>then</b>; the first time Reuben desecrated his father's bed was at the time he was conceived in the wrong womb, Leah's instead of Rachel's. Jacob's <b><span class=\"font1\">משכבים</span></b> were desecrated at that time, whereas Reuben personally had defiled Jacob's <b><span class=\"font1\">יצוע</span></b> when he mounted the bed in Bilhah's tent."

                    "<b> <span class=\"font1\">שמעון ולוי אחים</span>, Shimon and Levi are brothers, etc.</b> Jacob stressed the fact that Shimon and Levi were <b>brothers</b> as their similarity was natural, they shared many attitudes, something that is not always the case between brothers. It is also possible that Jacob referred to their joint action in Shechem as well as their plan to dispose of Joseph at the time, when he described their brotherliness. Jacob may have meant that these two between them shared the element of fire in an exaggerated manner. Our sages in <i>Yuma</i> 22 describe that Saul committed one sin which cost him the kingdom whereas David committed two serious sins without forfeiting his kingdom. The reason for this was that Saul was even-tempered by nature whereas David was impetuous by nature as we know from Samuel I 16,12 where the prophet describes David as <span class=\"font1\">אדמוני</span>, red cheeked, i.e. hot-blooded. When G'd judges people He makes allowances for their natural tendencies, their genetic mix. Although someone who contains a greater than average share of the element of fire will be most enthusiastic in his service of G'd as a result (as we know from the tribe of Levi), this enthusiasm does not act as a barrier against his committing errors on occasion. Such errors also reflect his genetic composition. The fact that a person such as Saul was of an even temperament usually acted as a barrier against his falling victim to the lures of the evil urge. When Jacob described Shimon and Levi as <b><span class=\"font1\">אחים</span></b> the word is derived from <b><span class=\"font1\">חם</span></b>, heat. Jacob cursed their anger because when it erupted it was apt to prove unusually destructive. Anger is rooted in the element fire.",
                    "Once such anger is kindled it results in excess heat and that is why Jacob compared their anger to <span class=\"font1\">כלי חמס מכרותיהם</span>, the use of weapons to commit violence. By stressing the word <span class=\"font1\">מכרותיהם</span>, (from the root <span class=\"font1\">הכר</span>, something one is conscious of), Jacob indicated that Shimon and Levi's tendencies to commit acts of violence were not something they had inherited from their father, something deeply rooted in their subconscious, but when such sentiments surfaced they became very conscious of them as such. The cause of their excesses was the extra amount of fire in the basic composition of their respective bodies.This genetic imbalance was responsible for such deeds as their act of violence against Joseph.",
                    "The word <span class=\"font1\">מכרותיהם</span> also contains the root <span class=\"font1\">מכר</span>, sale. Jacob referred to the sale of Joseph as an act of violence perpetrated by these two brothers, seeing that Joseph had not been guilty. Although all the brothers had participated in that sale, closer examination of what happened will show you that these two brothers were the instigators of all that violence. They were the ones who said to each other in 37,19: \"let us see what will become of his dreams when we will set out to kill him, etc.\" (compare <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 99,6)."

                    "<b> <span class=\"font1\">בסודם אל תבא נפשי</span>, \"My soul, do not come to their counsel.\"</b> We need to understand what precisely Jacob had in mind. Our sages in <i>Sanhedrin</i> 109 say that Jacob referred to the affair with Zimri in which the tribe of Shimon disgraced itself, and to the uprising of Korach which was a taint on the tribe of Levi. They also state that the words <span class=\"font1\">באפם הרגו איש</span> \"in their anger they slew a man,\" refer to Chamor and the men of Shechem, whereas the words <span class=\"font1\">וברצונם עקרו שור</span>, \"and it was their wish to uproot an ox,\" refer to their violence against Joseph (compare <i>Targum Yerushalmi).</i> These comments are all homiletical. One of the difficulties with this explanation is why Jacob would list events that were far in the future ahead of events which had already taken place, such as the violence against Joseph and Chamor? How could the word <span class=\"font1\">כי</span> be used in this verse when it does not relate to anything which preceded it? Besides, why would Jacob also associate Levi with the affair in which Zimri would disgrace himself by sleeping with a Midianite princess? Why did Jacob choose the expression <span class=\"font1\">ברצונם</span>, \"when it pleased them,\" to describe Shimon and Levi's planned violence against Joseph?",
                    "The plain meaning of the verse is that the entire verse speaks about the incident with Joseph. When Jacob refers to <span class=\"font1\">בסודם</span>, \"their secret,\" he meant that he did not want to be associated with these two brothers from the moment they began to hate Joseph, although they concealed their hatred for a while. When Jacob spoke about <span class=\"font1\">אל תבא נפשי</span>, this was his way of disassociating himself from any guilt concerning the behaviour of Shimon and Levi. Just as he had not transmitted spiritually corrupt genes to Reuben, so he had not burdened Shimon and Levi with spiritually defective genes when he fathered either one of them. Any evil concocted by these two brothers did not originate with him.",
                    "Jacob also wanted to state that he would not be punished for anything these two brothers had done because of his preferential treatment of Joseph being an underlying cause of the brothers' jealousy and hatred of him.",

He did not want these two sons to be known as \"the sons of Jacob\" as of that moment. Jacob considered such a designation of these two as an affront to his honour. <i>Tanchuma</i> in Parshat Vayeshev understands the word <span class=\"font1\">כבוד</span> as a reference to the presence of the <span class=\"font1\">שכינה</span> which had departed from Jacob the moment Joseph had become lost. The word <span class=\"font1\">כי</span> in <span class=\"font1\">בי באפם הרגו איש</span>, is the justification for Jacob not wanting his name associated with these two brothers. He referred to their having killed a man although we know in retrospect that this did not happen. Jacob considered the brothers' willingness to kill Joseph and to throw him into a pit full of reptiles as equivalent to exposing Joseph to many kinds of deaths.",

The Talmud <i>Sotah</i> 56 states that Joseph should have been the progenitor of 12 tribes. His encounter with the wife of Potiphar whose temptations he withstood only with the greatest amount of willpower caused him to forfeit the privilege of founding the other ten tribes.

Jacob realised that he had to find a way to \"cool\" this anger which was liable to flare up from time to time. Inasmuch as both brothers suffered from an excess amount of fire in their genetic mix, Jacob hoped that by separating them from one another he could forestall future outbursts or at least make such outbursts of anger less harmful.

We have confirmation of this in Chronicles I 5,2 where we read: \"for Yehudah became more powerful than his brothers and a leader came from him.\" At the appropriate time, Yehudah's hand would be at the neck of his enemies.

If this was so, why did Jacob have to tell us that there was a time when Yehudah was still only a cub? Besides, what did Jacob mean when he said: <span class=\"font1\">מטרף בני עלית</span> \"you removed yourself from my son, from the kill?\" According to our sages the word <span class=\"font1\">בני</span> may be read both as belonging to what was mentioned before as well as to what follows, i.e. \"you my son have arisen.\" Accordingly, Yehudah had distanced himself from what the brothers had done when Jacob had exclaimed: \"my son has been torn to shreds.\" It is difficult to reconcile this with the facts. Why would Jacob have assumed suddenly that Yehudah had no share in the brothers' plot to deceive him and to make him believe that Joseph had become the victim of wild animals? On the contrary, is it not more likely to believe that Jacob had never suspected <b>any</b> of his sons to have laid a hand on Joseph? We must view the statement of our sages as <span class=\"font1\">דברי קבלה</span>, as reflecting insights to which we are not privy. The words <span class=\"font1\">כרע רבץ מי יקימנו</span>, also present a difficulty. Not only do these words not make sense as part of the blessing, but why did Jacob suddenly switch to indirect speech when up until now he had addressed Yehudah directly?",
                    "In order to understand these verses a short introduction will enable us to gain a deeper insight into the ways of the Torah. We perceive Adam as a tree from which all the <b>holy</b> souls that would ever enter the world were suspended. When Adam sinned, evil assumed a limited rule in our world and captured many of these <b>holy</b> souls. According to our Kabbalists it has been the task of the Jewish people to rescue as many of these holy souls who are kept prisoners within the <span class=\"font1\">קליפה</span> (forces of negative spirituality), using the holy Torah and G'd's commandments all of which G'd has implanted in our midst as our weaponry. On occasion, even a close personal attachment such as the rape of a person containing a holy Jewish soul and the impure soul of a Gentile may result in a new life of a positive kind. Shechem's deep-seated attachment to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob whom he had raped may be an example of such a phenomenon (Genesis 34,33). According to <i>Kohelet Yaakov,</i> Dinah infused Shechem with part of her holy soul, something which eventually resulted in the emergence and liberation of the soul of Rabbi Chanina ben Tradyon. This is alluded to in the word <b><span class=\"font1\">רחבת</span></b> in <span class=\"font1\">רחבת ידים</span> (Genesis 34,21) the letters of which are an acronym of the respective first letters in the name <span class=\"font1\">דבי חנינה בן תרדיון</span>.",
                    "On other occasions a soul which was taken captive at the time Adam sinned may emerge of its own accord at the time when the forces in charge of the <span class=\"font1\">קליפה</span> decide to swamp earth with many new lives (souls). Such formerly captive holy souls who have initiated their own conversion to Judaism will often make every effort to pursue the path of goodness. This explains the phenomenon that converts very often become more meticulous in their observance of Jewish law than natural-born Jews. Ruth the Moabite and Naamah the Ammonite are part of the phenomenon we have just described. Their souls had become captive due to the acts of incest committed by their ancestor when Lot's daughters slept with their father. When their \"captor\" i.e. the force or angel in charge of releasing impure souls into the world, released a quantity of such souls, hoping to contaminate the earth with still more negative spirituality, two of the souls originally held captive escaped and turned out to become Ruth and Naamah. The fact that Ruth became the ancestor of David whereas Naamah became the wife Rechavam indicate the sins of their ancestor who slept with his daughters. Lot's older daughter who had the effrontery to call the name of her son i.e. <span class=\"font1\">מואב</span>, i.e. \"from my father,\" had committed a greater offence than her younger sister who called the child of that union <span class=\"font1\">בן עמי</span>. The fact that Ruth was descended from Moab whereas Naamah was descended from Ammon reflects the phenomenon that the greater the spiritual morass that one has emerged from the greater the effort at one's spiritual rehabilitation. This is why David and a whole dynasty of kings is descended from Ruth, whereas Naamah the offspring of Lot's younger daughter is comparativeley less illustrious (compare <i>Baba Kama</i> 38 where the Talmud even attributes G'd's command to treat Ammon more mildly than Moab to the minor difference between the acts committed by Lot's two daughters). It is important to remember that if a person of lesser stature than Lot had perpetrated these acts he would not have had the good fortune that in the cause of centuries at least two good people came out of him. [I have some problem with the whole premise; according to the seven Noachidic laws it was perfectly permissible for a father to sleep with his daughter, all the more so since Lot was not even aware of it. Ed.] Just as there are different levels of righteousness amongst the observant Jews, i.e. goodness is a relative term, so there are different degrees amongst the people whose souls originate in the pool at the disposal of the forces of the <span class=\"font1\">קליפה</span>. Amongst the many kings and leaders of Gentile society, all of whose souls originate in the pool of souls provided by the forces of the <span class=\"font1\">קליפה</span>, some are models of virtue whereas others are models of debauchery, perfidy, and cruelty. This is the mystical dimension of what we are taught in <i>Sotah</i> 49 that <span class=\"font1\">בעקבות משיחה חוצפה יסגא</span>, that \"in the days preceding the arrival of the Messiah, effrontery will become prevalent.\" The sages meant that as the number of holy souls amongst the pool of souls controlled by the forces of the <span class=\"font1\">קליפה</span> becomes more and more depleted, the tempering influence exercised on the whole pool of spiritually negative souls by the holy souls held captive will cease. This accounts for the fact that in days of old the souls that found their way back to the realm of holy souls produced spiritual giants such as Abraham, Sarah, Ruth and the like. Even in later generations converts such as Shemayah and Avtalyon are examples of souls who became spiritual giants amongst our people. Onkelos is another such example. Present day converts, however, are the souls who had already been greatly impoverished during their prolonged stay as captives amongst the pool of spiritually deficient souls, a pool which had been more and more depleted of such souls as the one of Abraham, Sarah, etc. The Talmud describes the period preceding the arrival of the Messiah by using the term <b><span class=\"font1\">עקבות</span></b>, heels. This is an allusion to the pool of the impure souls which by that time will contain only relatively insignificant souls from the pool of holy souls that the forces of the <span class=\"font1\">קליפה</span> had captured when Adam sinned. These souls are described as no more than \"heels,\" the lower extremity of the human body, i.e. a relatively derogatory term. We can find confirmation of that thought in the <i>Zohar</i> 1, page 258.",
                    "With the help of this introduction we can begin to understand the advice given by G'd to Yehudah when He sent His angel and almost forced him to have intercourse with the woman whom he considered a harlot (as described in <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 85,8). On the one hand, according to Torah law, it was not <b>appropriate</b> for Yehudah to have sexual relations with his daughter-in-law. [I have chosen this expression because Noachide law, which Yehudah was subject to, permits relations between a father-in-law and daughter-in-law. Ed.] Inasmuch as Yehudah was unaware of that woman's identity at the time, he did not know that he committed a forbidden act. Moreover, he acted under heavenly compulsion. The combination of all these factors enabled him to release the souls of Peretz and Zerach who were part of the souls captured by the forces of evil at the time Adam ate from the tree of knowledge. We know that these two souls contained within them great spiritual potential since great people are descended from them. The \"captor\" of such souls, i.e. the forces of the <span class=\"font1\">קליפה</span>, can be presumed to have guarded them especially carefully so that they should not escape from his clutches. No wonder then that a great individual of the calibre of royalty such as Yehudah was needed to become the instrument of their release from that captivity. Unless such a soul had been accused of the morally depraved sin of incest (the appearance of it) it might never have been able to escape its original environment amongst the spiritually inferior pool of souls.",
                    "This is what the Torah had in mind when it states, using indirect speech, i.e. G'd is speaking: <span class=\"font1\">גור אריה יהודה</span>. This means that prior to Yehudah's union with Tamar he had only been a cub. This was also hinted at when his father had said to him previously: <span class=\"font1\">אתה יודוך אחיך</span>, up until now <b>you only</b> merited that your brothers deferred to you by dint of some personal stature you possessed; this stature did not yet have historic significance. Yehudah acquired significance as a historic personality only as a result of his divinely induced union with Tamar. If you want proof of this, just search our records and see which great personalities other than Peretz and Zerach are descended from him. Once Yehudah had united with Tamar he qualified for the title <span class=\"font1\">אריה</span>, a fully grown lion. Jacob then went on to explain the underlying cause of Yehudah's spiritual rise. It was <span class=\"font1\">מטרף בני עלית</span>, \"you my son were able to tear yourself away from the prey\" i.e. from the pool of captive holy souls that had been snatched by the forces of the <span class=\"font1\">קליפה</span> as the result of Adam's sin. Your divinely induced union with Tamar enabled some of these souls to become free once more and join the pool of holy souls. The sons you have acquired for yourself as a result of this union enable you to establish an everlasting dynasty.",
                    "When the Torah continued with <span class=\"font1\">כרע רבץ</span>, this is a reference to the prey which proved to be the source of Yehudah's spiritual ascent, something G'd had referred to when He told Cain in Genesis 4,7: \"sin crouches at its door;\" Yehudah had not had a prior opportunity to rescue the precious souls of Peretz and Zerach.",
                    "When the Torah continues calling Yehudah both <span class=\"font1\">אריה</span> and <span class=\"font1\">לביא</span>, this is a hint that these souls were guarded within the <span class=\"font1\">קליפה</span> by a power comparable to a <span class=\"font1\">לביא</span>, so that only an <span class=\"font1\">אריה</span>, a fully grown lion, had the power to rescue them. Yehudah was that \"lion\" of a holy soul who could perform such a deed successfully. As of that time the sceptre would not depart from Yehudah, i.e. he had laid the foundation for an enduring dynasty. We are still looking forward daily to the resumption of the monarchy by a descendant of Yehudah (the Messiah)."

                    "<b> <span class=\"font1\">אסרי לגפן עירה</span>, \"He ties his ass to a vine, etc.\"</b> There are numerous explanations of this verse; their common denominator is that they are all of a homiletical nature. Perhaps the verse is again speaking about the arrival of the Messiah who has been mentioned at the end of the last verse, i.e. <span class=\"font1\">עד כי יבא שילה</span>. Jacob had described that period as one when all the nations of the world will seek out the Messiah. This verse would then describe the Messiah as tying his donkey to the vine, i.e. Israel. Israel has been compared to the vine in Psalms 80,9: \"You plucked up a vine from Egypt, You expelled nations and planted it.\" The \"donkey\" in this verse refers to the Gentile nations. We have several instances in the Bible in which the Gentile nations are compared to donkeys. The first such instance is in Genesis 22,5 where Abraham compares the Gentiles to the donkey (according to <i>Kidushin</i> 68). We also have a very clear such comparison in Ezekiel 23,20 where the prophet compares Israel's promiscuity with Gentiles as a lust for the flesh of donkeys. When Jacob proceeds to speak of the <span class=\"font1\">שרקה</span> an especially long vine, as a branch to which the Messiah will tie his she-ass's colt, he makes a fine distinction between the male and female souls that originate in the domain of the <span class=\"font1\">קליפה</span>. He calls the male, <span class=\"font1\">עיר</span>, whereas he calls the female <span class=\"font1\">אתון</span>. When speaking of Israel as a whole, i.e. <span class=\"font1\">גפן</span> he describes the Messiah as tying the male Gentiles to the whole vine, whereas when speaking of the female Gentiles he speaks of the Messiah tying them to a single branch of that vine. Not that much restraining power is needed to control the females.",
                    "Alternatively, our verse speaks of two different periods of well known redemptions. The first is the redemption from Egypt, whereas the second refers to the ultimate redemption in the days of the Messiah who is descended from David. Concerning he first redemption, Jacob said: <span class=\"font1\">אסרי לגפן עירה</span>, he ties his donkey to a vine, similar to the verse in Psalms 80,9 a period when G'd humbled a single nation before the Jews, i.e. the Egyptians. Concerning the redemption in the future, Jacob speaks of the <span class=\"font1\">שרקה</span>, the whistle, in the sense that the prophet Zachariah did in Zachariah 10,8: <span class=\"font1\">אשרקה להם ואקבצם כי פדית</span>, \"I will whistle to them and gather them, for I will redeem them.\" Jacob speaks of <span class=\"font1\"><b>בני</b> אתונו</span>, i.e. the plural, since at that time Israel will be redeemed from many different nations. At the time of the Exodus, the redemption comprised the defeat of Egypt and the Canaanites, i.e. seven of the Canaanite nations. The remainder of the seventy nations were not humbled before Israel at that time. When the final redemption will occur all the other nations too will be humbled before Israel. These are the <span class=\"font1\">בני אתונו</span>, the offspring of the original <span class=\"font1\">עירה</span>.",
                    "Perhaps Jacob referred to a concept which we know from the <i>Zohar</i> Pinchas page 231, that in the domain of the <span class=\"font1\">סטרא אחרא</span>, the realm of the spiritually negative manifestations of the ten emanations, the power of female is actually stronger than that of the male. The male just takes the \"left-overs\" of the female and is therefore known as the <span class=\"font1\">יותרת הכבד</span>. [We find two expressions involving the <span class=\"font1\">כבד</span> in Leviticus 9,10 where the Torah speaks of: <span class=\"font1\">ואת היותרת מן הכבד</span>, \"the addition coming out of the <span class=\"font1\">כבד</span>,\" and in Leviticus 3,15 where same is described as: <span class=\"font1\">ואת היותרת על הכבד</span>, \"the addition which is on the <span class=\"font1\">כבד</span>.\" According to the <i>Zohar</i> the word <span class=\"font1\">כבד</span> does not merely mean liver but is a hyperbole for the male with whom Lilith consorts. The spiritually negative forces in this world are sometimes referred to as Samael sometimes as the serpent. Samael is the male part of that team, Lilith, is the female. When adultery is committed, the female partner is released from the <span class=\"font1\">כבד</span>, i.e. <span class=\"font1\">מן הכבד</span>. Having once been released it assumes a dominance over its former partner so that it will qualify for the description <span class=\"font1\">על הכבד</span>, \"on top of the <span class=\"font1\">כבד</span>.\" It follows that in the scheme of the powers of evil described by the <i>Zohar,</i> the female is viewed as stronger than the male. Ed.] Jacob described that in his dreams he found it relatively easy to battle the male forces i.e. Samael, whereas he found it much more exhausting to battle the female forces i.e. Lilith. Even when he finally won a victory against those forces, such a victory was not absolute and his dominance could not be compared to his dominance over the parallel male forces of Satan. In view of Jacob's personal experiences in battling the forces of Satan he referred to the <span class=\"font1\">שרקה</span> as the female of these forces and said: At the time when G'd will whistle, i.e. announce the coming of the final redemption and will gather in the children of the she-ass, i.e. the forces which emanate from the female of the <span class=\"font1\">קליפה</span>, He will also \"tie them up,\" i.e. subdue them, before Israel.",
                    "Do not be concerned at the fact that we divide this verse by applying part to the time of Moses and part to the time of the redemption at the time of the Messiah; you, my reader, are surely familiar with the words of the <i>Zohar</i> section 2, page 120, that Moses is viewed as the redeemer who redeemed our forefathers and as the redeemer who will lead their children back to the land of their ancestors as is written in Kohelet 1,9: \"<span class=\"font1\">מה שהיה הוא שיהיה</span>. The first letters of the first three words of that line form the acronym <span class=\"font1\">משה</span>. Solomon alludes to the fact that he who has been a redeemer in the past will again be a redeemer in the future. Do not counter by saying that the redeemer of the future will be from the tribe of Yehudah and will either be descended from king David or will be king David himself reincarnate (compare <i>Sanhedrin</i> 98 based on Ezekiel 37,24: \"and My servant David will be king over them\"). In view of all these prophecies how could we say that the redeemer of the future will come from the tribe of Levi?",
                    "You must realise that the soul of Moses was composed of all twelve tribes of Israel, all the 600.000 being \"branches\" of it. David's soul therefore was also a branch of Moses' soul. This is also why you find that while in the desert Moses performed the duties of both king, priest, Levite, prophet, scholar and military hero. He was only able to perform all these functions because his soul comprised all branches of holiness. When the redeemer will appear in the future, it will be revealed that Moses was the root of all monarchy in Israel and that David will be perceived as <span class=\"font1\">שילה</span> (numerical value of <span>=345</span><span class=\"font1\">משה</span>).",
                    "<b><span class=\"font1\">כבס ביין לבושו</span>, \"he will launder his garments in wine, etc.</b>\" In order to understand these words we must recall a statement in the <i>Zohar Chadash</i> on Parshat Bereshit that in order to be redeemed from the fourth of the four exiles Israel experiences we must possess the redeeming merit of Torah study and Torah knowledge. In the absence of such merit the redemption may be long delayed. Jacob alluded to this when he said <span class=\"font1\">כבס ביין לבושו</span>. The specific strength of the king who will be the Messiah is his preoccupation with Torah. The Torah knowledge is symbolised by his wearing purple robes (colour of wine). ",
                    "If at the appointed time, G'd forbid, the Jewish people will not be able to provide such a purple mantle for their redeemer because they are devoid of Torah knowledge, then the redemption will be characterised by the advent of a cruel king, someone like Haman, and the \"blood of grapes,\" i.e. real Jewish blood, instead of blood commuted into the wine of Torah learning, will flow in order that G'd will be able to keep to His schedule for the redemption (compare <i>Sanhedrin</i> 97). The \"sparks\" of sanctity remaining amongst the Jews may then be released only through very painful afflictions. In other words, Jacob warns that redemption can come about by means of a dignified mode of life, one that includes Torah study, or, G'd forbid, by means of a demeaning way of life and the resultant loss of dignity. The reason Jacob chose the simile of grapes is that in order to produce wine from grapes they have to be pressed, i.e. they have to be \"tortured\" to release the best that is within them.",
                    "The reason that Jacob speaks only about <span class=\"font1\">דם ענבים</span>, blood from the grapes, and not from a branch of the vine or a whole cluster of grapes for instance, is to console us that even if the redemption will become possible only by means of additional afflictions it will not cause a major dismemberment of the Jewish people. ",
                    "Just as the grapes are a minor part of the whole vine, so the garment of the Messiah described here is not <span class=\"font1\">כסות</span>, something large enough to serve as a total garment, but a diminutive <span class=\"font1\">סותה</span>, a mini-garment. There would not ever be sufficient blood from the grapes to enable a whole garment to be drenched in it, as opposed to a redemption which occurs as a result of the people's Torah's study, the merit of which would suffice to dye the whole mantle of the Messiah purple."

The Egyptians did the crying, the Israelites the singing. <b><span class=\"font1\">חכלילי עינים</span>, \"red-eyed;\"</b> the colour red is reminiscent of judgments, everything connected with redness is an allusion to the power of judgment which involves the blood of one party versus the blood of his adversary. The reason Jacob said: <span class=\"font1\">מיין</span>, from wine, is a reminder that judgment originates in wine, [had Adam not eaten from the tree of knowledge, i.e. the vine, judgment in the sense of retribution would have had no place on earth.

Just as Jacob had not remained in his regular abode that night, so Issachar, the son who had been conceived during that night, would be \"crouching <b>between</b> boundaries.\" Inasmuch as Issachar is the model of a person who devotes his life to Torah study, Jacob alluded to the phenomenon that Yeshivah students have a habit of moving from place to place. Every action which is not proper produces consequences which reflect that impropriety. Leah's action <b>appeared</b> too forward for the conduct associated with the traditional way of life of Jewish women, even though her intention was wholly honourable.

The words <span class=\"font1\">כי טוב</span>, refer to what happens after a person considers that all the pleasures available for the body in this world, such as eating fine food and drinking good wine, are all sensations which are devoid of an inherent value. They are meaningful only because the body, an empty vessel, needs to be filled up with food and drink as the Creator has decreed that it is incapable of existing without input of food and drink. As a result, once the body has absorbed enough food an drink, the very food and drink which provided these pleasurable sensations become revolting. This fact demonstrates that food and drink are not in themselves something desirable. Solomon makes that point in Proverbs 23,8 when he said: \"once you have eaten <b>your</b> bread, you will vomit it;\" he meant that when you have consumed all the bread of this world, the time will come when you vomit it as it will become repugnant for you to fill your mouth with it. The same applies to all the other pleasures this world has to offer, things which man is attracted to by his eyes. Once he examines these phenomena more thoroughly he will realise that they are only make believe, that they lack substance, and eventually he will develop a distaste for everything connected with the human body and its attractions. He will conclude that the real good can be found only in the Hereafter, the world which is all spirit. Jacob blessed Issachar by saying that he has realised that true repose is only in those regions. Issachar correctly evaluates the repose in the Hereafter as well as the relative pleasantness on earth, i.e. <span class=\"font1\">והארץ כי נעמה</span>. ",

If so, the Torah did not include Joseph as more than one tribe, though Jacob had said to him (48,5): \"Ephrayim and Menashe shall be to me like Reuben and Shimon.\" If Levi is not included in the number twelve, as we find for instance when the Israelites were being counted at the beginning of the Book of Numbers when the flags and positions around the Tabernacle were assigned, why was Levi denied his father's blessing? If the reason was that Jacob criticised him and only those who had received blessings were included in the count, why were Reuben and Shimon included seeing they too had been criticised?",

This is why the Torah employs the expression <span class=\"font1\">דבר</span>, an expression reserved for harsh words or a harsh tone. The Torah adds <span class=\"font1\">ויברך אותם</span>, he blessed them, to make certain we do not misunderstand. When we look at the way Jacob censured Reuben, we are reminded of the <i>Sifri in Behaalotcha</i> according to which the privileges of the firstborn will be restored to them in the future. Inasmuch as Jacob called Reuben his firstborn this was an encouragement for all the firstborn to look forward to the future when they would again be allowed to function as priests. It was on account of that future that Jacob was so intent to acquire the birthright from Esau at the time. The idea that there would come a time when Esau would perform the service in the Holy Temple was anathema to Jacob. This does not mean that in the future these privileges will be denied to the Levites. At the time envisaged both the firstborn and the Levites will share equally in those functions that were performed by the Levites when the Temple was standing. Jacob also blessed Simon and Levi when he cursed their anger. His blessing consisted in that he cursed their excess amount of anger. By reducing their natural tendency to anger he bestowed a veritable blessing upon them. The fact that he decreed that when the land of Canaan would be distributed they should be split up and scattered throughout the land was also a blessing as it would help to blunt any harmful results whenever they would have occasion to display their anger.",

On the other hand, if the interim owner had caused damage, he has to compensate the neighbour to whom this field should have been sold in the first place.",
