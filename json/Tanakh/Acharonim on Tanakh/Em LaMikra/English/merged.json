                    "<b>And they shall make for themselves, fringes (<i>tzitzit</i>):</b> It is a sign of their priesthood, of their eternal priesthood, as it is written (Exodus 19:6), \"And you will be to Me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation.\" And just as the Children of Aharon are separated from other Jews by their clothing, because they are priests of our nation; so too is Israel separated from the nations with their clothing. For they are the priests of the entire [human] specie. And I see an amazing similarity: For with the high priest, it states (Exodus 28:36), \"And you shall make a <i>tzitz</i> (diadem) of pure gold\"; and with Israel it states, \"And they shall make for themselves, <i>tzitzit</i> on the corners of their garments.\" With the high priest, it states (Exodus 39:31), \"They put  on it a greenish-blue string (<i>ptil tekhelet</i>)\"; and with Israel, it states \"and they will place with the fringes of each corner a greenish-blue string.\" And you will not find, \"a greenish-blue string\" anywhere besides these two articles. With the high priest, it states (Exodus 28:36), \"and engrave on it, etc., 'Holy unto the Lord'\"; and with Israel, it is stated, \"In order that you shall remember, etc. and you shall be holy to your God.\" With the high priest, it states (Exodus 28:38), \"And it shall be on his forehead always, for favor upon them before the Lord\"; and with Israel, it is stated, \"and you will look upon it and you will remember etc. and you will not search, etc.\" And even though it is written, <i>tzitz</i>, with the high priest; whereas it is written, <i>tzitzit</i>, with the commanded shawl (<i>talit</i>), the derivation of the word [in both cases] is the same. For both of them are from the expression, flower and bud (<i>tzitz</i>). And that is why hair on the head is called, <i>tzitzit</i> - since they are like buds that emerge from a sapling and from a tree. And likewise did Rabbi Abarbanel understand it. As he wrote that the emergence of the flower and the bud from the staff of Aharon was because the high priesthood was fit for him. And [he wrote as follows]: And since it stated (Numbers 17:23), \"<i>vayatzetz tzitz</i> (and it had blossomed a blossom,),\" it taught that Aharon was designated for the high priesthood and would merit the garments of the high priesthood. For the <i>tzitz</i> is the greatest in stature among them. To here [are his words]. Behold he made the <i>tzitz</i> of the high priest to be like the matter of, \"it had put forth a sprouting-flower, it had blossomed a blossom.\" And this is in the fashion that we wrote. And likewise are the children of a person called, <i>tzetzaim</i>; and so too is the expression, <i>tzitz</i> and <i>tzitzit</i>, one of going out and of giving birth. It is true that this is not the opinion of Gesenius about the word, <i>tzitz</i>. For he wrote that it is called this as it emits splendor, since it shines. But, if so, it would have been appropriate to also call the other articles of gold that were on the high priest and the Temple [this], since they [also] shine - especially the breastplate and the stones of the smock (<i>ephod</i>). And do not argue that it is [so described] from the word, <i>urim</i> (associated with lights, <i>orim</i>) and <i>tumim</i>! For the <i>urim</i> and <i>tumim</i> are not the stones themselves. As it is written thus (Exodus 28:30): \"Place in the breastplate the <i>urim</i> and <i>tumim</i>.\" It is [then] a proof from there that the <i>urim</i> are not the stones. But if you want to say that the <i>tzitz</i> of the high priest is from an expression of light, <i>tzitzit</i> is also close to this. As it appears that it can be resolved as being from this idea, and that such is [actually] more acceptable than the [connection to the] <i>tzitz</i> itself. For behold, it is written explicitly about <i>tzitzit</i>, \"and you will look upon it,\" Behold, it was given for seeing. And, if so, it is probable to say it is from the [same] usage as, \"peering (<i>metzitz</i>) [through] the lattice\" (Song of Songs 2:9). But we have not found a proof for the golden <i>tzitz</i>, except that which we have found in the words of our Rabbis that he should not remove his thoughts from it. And behold that is mental sight, similar to, \"and you will look upon it,\" concerning the <i>tzitzit</i>. And now I thought to point out some of the other similarities that are between them, meaning between the commanded <i>talit</i> and the priestly garments. And they are really amazing! For they will show to anyone who speaks truth in his heart that all of the words of our mouth [here] are right: 1] In the making of the strings of the <i>tzitzit</i>, it is learned in the Sifrei, that it needs to be twisted. As it is learned that, \"greenish-blue\" is [also] found about the tabernacle - just like there [the fibers must be] twisted, here too [they must be] twisted. And how pleasant are these words of the Sifrei, and the comparison to the tabernacle, in that it is the place of priestly service, so that the priestly garments are also included. And even though the Rambam did not mention this to be the law, the Raavad (on Mishneh Torah, Laws of Fringes 1:10), may his memory be blessed, nevertheless already objected against this. And even the Kesef Mishneh, whose approach is to defend the Rambam, found almost nothing to say. And the Rambam himself in his answer to the Sages of Lunel, concluded [as follows]: And I do not have any other proof about this. And the Rabbi, Kesef Mishneh, commented well with [these words]: And it appears that because he saw those weaknesses in his words, he wrote, \"And I do not have any other proof about this.\" 2] The four [sets of] fringes impede one another (all of them must be present to be effective, Menachot 28, Mishneh Torah, Laws of Fringes 1). And likewise a high priest who served with less then eight [priestly] garments or a simple priest with less than four, is called lacking garments (and so, is ineffective, Mishneh Torah, Vessels of the Sanctuary and Those Who Serve Therein 10). 3] How do we make fringes, etc. One puts in four strings and doubles them up in the middle. It comes out that there will be eight strands hanging down from the corner (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Fringes 1:6). And with the priestly garments, any place that it states, twisted, the string must be made of eight [strands]. Moreover, Item 1 can be said [here also], that it is learned that the fringes must be twisted from the twisting of the tabernacle. 4] It is permissible to enter a toilet or a bathhouse with fringes. If the white or greenish-blue strings get severed, they can be thrown to the trash heap, since it is a commandment that has no holiness in its substance (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Fringes 3:9). It is [similarly] permissible to derive benefit form priestly garments, even not during the time of service. (Mishneh Torah, Vessels of the Sanctuary and Those Who Serve Therein 8). And while priestly garments do have holiness in their substance, it is the opinion of the Ritva that they are not holy in their substance in the same way as the serving vessels, but their law is rather one of holiness of the value, see there in the Rabbi, Mishneh LeMelekh. And likewise did the Rambam write about fringes: It is forbidden to sell a fringed garment to a non-Jew until he removes the fringes - not because there is holiness in the substance, etc. 5] And more than anything else, that which fringes is an exception to the rule, to push off the prohibition of <i>shatnez</i> (forbidden mixture of wool and linen) - since the greenish-blue [fabric] is wool and the Torah obligates [us] to place it in a garment of wool or of linen, this coming from the juxtaposition of, \"Do not wear a forbidden mixture [...\" and,] \"Make yourself twisted-cords\" (Deuteronomy 22:11-12) - and who will not be amazed when he remembers that forbidden mixtures are not permitted anywhere else in the entire Torah except in only one other topic, and that would be the priestly garments!?!
