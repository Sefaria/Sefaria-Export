This is difficult to understand, for why would one think that they would ask for reward based on the good deeds that they had already performed? A person can never have any claim that Hashem owes him, because all of the mitzvot that a person does can never be sufficient to pay Hashem back for all the goodness that He does…  ",
                "The answer to this question is that when it says that the righteous can claim based on their good deeds it does not refer to those good deeds that they have already performed, but to those good deeds that they will do in the future. For it is understood that no righteous person wants to claim any physical benefit, except in order to be able to fulfill another mitzva… If so, Moshe could have based his request on those good deeds that he would do in the future if Hashem would grant him his request. This is something real."

However they do not do so out of fear of Hashem, but for some other purpose, to achieve a material goal, or out of fear for some person who forces them to act against their will. This causes Hashem’s name to be profaned, for without doubt Hashem examines the hearts and know that they are not acting for the right reason, and He punishes them for their evil thoughts. Those who witness this see them involved in learning Torah and performing mitzvos, and will criticize Hashem’s actions. Therefore our Sages have said: If you see a generation for whom the Torah is not dear to it, gather to yourself (Berachot 63a). The Sages were not speaking about a generation that does not learn Torah at all, but is referring to those who learn but not out of fear of Hashem. Therefore the Torah is not dear to them, as their main goal and priority, but they have some other value and goal… Hashem will find reasons to destroy the wisdom of the wise people of such a generation, because such learning does not create a pleasant spirit before Him."
