                    "<b>I am unworthy, etc.</b> - (Shabbat 32a): [Rabbi Yannai] said, \"A person should never stand in a place of danger saying that they [on High] will perform a miracle for him, lest they do not perform a miracle for him. And [even] if they do perform a miracle for him, they will deduct it from his merits.\" Rabbi Ḥanin said, \"What is the verse [that alludes to this]? When Jacob said, '<i>Katonti</i> (I am not worthy) of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which You have shown unto Your servant'\" (Genesis 32:11). <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> He explains \"<i>katonti</i>,\" as my merits have become small. But ostensibly, this requires [further] study - as note that Ya'akov [only] used this expression out of modesty. So there is no hint here to the diminution of merits. And see Ramban and Maharsha, who have [already] pointed this out. But it appears to me that [its understanding] is according to that which is written in Bava Kamma 50b, \"Anyone who says that the Holy One, blessed be He, is a Relinquisher will have his life relinquished.\" And if so, once Ya'akov said that he was not worthy of all the goodnesses; if so, they could not be done for him for free, but rather his merits [must have been] diminished.</i>"

                    "From where do we derive that we drink four cups of wine at the Pesach [seder]? Rabbi Yohanan said: It  corresponds to the four redemptions: 'I will  take you out;'  'I will save you;' 'I will redeem you;' 'I will take you to me.' Three of these are found in this  verse, and one in the verse immediately following. In all of the decisors and commentators and books of legends that bring this saying, it is brought using the language, \"It corresponds to the four languages of redemption.\" But if we look in the Palestinian Talmud from which the phrase is quoted, the word \"languages\" is missing. Rather it says, \"four redemptions.\" In my view, this is a very significant distinction. For if we understand it according to its plain meaning, the notion of four languages of redemption is not a reason to establish four cups of thanksgiving, since there is but one redemption, whether we speak of it using one word or four.  But if there are four redemptions, then that explains the matter much better, for when we examine it well we find that there are four different ideas expressed in these four terms, and each one  is its own complete idea unto itself and deserving of its own thanksgiving. In the first statement (\"I will take you out\"), we see that the Holy Blessed One took them out from under the labors of the Egyptians, which is to say that God lightened their labors--but they were not freed completely. Then God added to this, \"And I will save you from their servitude,\" which means that they did not serve them at all. But even after these two promises, they were still servants to Pharaoh and had not achieved full redemption.  Thus God added, \"And I will redeem you,\" but even so they were not yet made a special acquisition of the Holy Blessed One, and so God added, \"And I will take you to me to be a people, and I will be God to  you.\" We see that within these sayings are included  separate notions of redemption. The verses continue in a \"not only this, but also this\" fashion--that is to say, not only will I do this, but I will also do this, and not only that, but also this, etc. As such, the simple meaning is revealed: We are obligated to give thanks for each individual act that increased the redemption. And that is why [the Sages] established the four cups of thanksgiving. And why did they not establish a cup for the phrase \"and I will bring you to the land?\" We cannot say that it is because that language is unrelated to the redemption, since they  established a cup for \"and I will take you to me to be a people,\" which is likewise not specifically an aspect of redemption. Rather, the simple answer is that since we are still in exile, and the land is in the hands of foreigners, it is impossible to raise a glass of wine for this. And perhaps, in recognition of this, they established a special cup in the name of Elijah, as a remembrance and hint that we hope for his coming and for the resurrection of the nation and the land speedily in our days."

                    "But the offerings themselves, the women do indeed bring them. The explanation is not that women may not, but rather that they are not obligated, as is explained in Chagiga 15b that women would indeed lay their hands on [Rambam 3:8 Laws of Offerings does not make this point explicit]. But as emissaries of their husbands they indeed would be prohibited, as will be explained in verse 4, on the phrase \"he lays his hand\", and see Tosafot on Mas. Rosh Hashana 33a. Similarly, the gemara exempts women from all of the various actions of the offering - the waving, approaching, kamitza, incense offering, slitting, blood-receing, and springkling - since for all of these the verse states \"the sons of Israel/Aaron\" and the sages extrapolate this to mean, \"and not the daughters of Israel/Aaron.\" Tosafot question this, and ask why the sages needed to exclude women from all of these [based on these verses]; they should already be excluded based on the broad principle of \"positive time-bound commandments\", as these actions only take place during the day, as we learn in the verse at the end of Parshat Tzav. But I do not understand this; what did Tosafot see to ask such a question?! The essential act of bringing an offering itself only happens during the day, and yet once we have seen that the Torah empowers women to bring offerings like men, then clearly the Torah has obligated them in the mitzvah of offerings even though it is a time-bound mitzvah! And therefore, one in fact would've assumed that they are similarly obligated in all of the constituitive elements of the offering, and there would not have been a logical reason to exempt them from the details when they are obligated in the general action....     And as for the general principle that women are obligated in offerings like men: the source is in Torat Cohanim, Parshat Emor (22:18) -  איש איש מבית ישראל ומן הגר בישראל אשר יקריב קרבנו לכל נדריהם וגו', בישראל לרבות נשים ועבדים - And similarly explains the Rambam in Hil. Korbanot, 3:2. \"Men, women, and slaves all bring offerings.\" The Kessef Mishna writes by way of finding a source for the Rambam, \"It is obvious that the Torah equates men and women for every rule of the Torah, and we've already said that women do not lay their hands, nor perform the wave-offerings, etc - only men do these things - this implies that women do, however, bring offerings, and every mitzvah that a women is obligated in, so too are slaves.\" Behold, according to the source in Torah Cohanim that we cited - it is shocking to see the lenghty description [of the Kessef Mishna], who is trying to find a source for the words of the Rambam based on talmudic inferences. But the source is plain, obvious, and well understood! He should have simply noted the citation in the Torat Cohanim, and nothing further."

                    "It was taught: Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel said, \"On the fifteenth of Av, the tribes were permitted to intermarry with each other without concern for the inheritance. This is explained in the portion (Parashat) [of the Torah].\" What is the interpretation of the verse \"This is the thing\"? It means that this practice was applicable only in that specific generation, as the reason for this interpretation is that we find the phrase \"this is the thing\" primarily used in relation to the specific time, as seen in Parashat Beshalach (Exodus 16:16) and in Parashat Tetzaveh (Exodus 30:23), regarding matters that were only relevant for their respective times. However, it is not explicitly stated where they derived the authority and foundation to suspend a commandment from the Torah. Indeed, it is difficult to establish a foundation to suspend an explicit commandment based solely on the precision of the phrase \"this is the thing\" without further clarification in the Torah.It is possible to say that they had received a tradition that the main instruction regarding the inheritance issue was applicable only during the division of the land, in order for each tribe's portion to be known and clarified. But afterwards, in generations where the portions were already determined and assigned, there was no longer a need to be concerned about intermarriage and inheritance issues. In that case, the commandment was not nullified until a known time when they realized that it was impossible to fulfill it without intertribal marriages, and they then permitted it. They found a hint to this in the Torah through the phrase \"this is the thing,\" as explained. This is my opinion, and one should further consult the depths of the Ramban's commentary. (Ta'anit 30b)",
                    "It was taught: There is a difference between fathers and sons. In the case of fathers, it is stated (in Parashat Chelek): \"Every daughter who inherits.\" But in the case of sons, it is not so. This means that the prohibition of intertribal inheritance applies only to that specific generation and is not a commandment for future generations, as explained previously. What does it imply? Rava said, \"This is the thing\" - this matter applies only to this generation. This has already been clarified in the previous interpretation. May it be well understood. (Bava Batra 120a)",
                    "<b>For their own benefit...</b> Rav Yehuda said in the name of Shmuel: The daughters of Tzelafchad were permitted to marry men from any tribe, as it is stated: \"For their own benefit they may marry.\" However, how do I fulfill the phrase \"only within the family of their father's tribe shall they marry\"? It is a good advice that the verse provides, stating that they should marry only within their tribe, but not limiting them to their own family. This principle is not explicitly clarified in the text. Why did Shmuel find it necessary to extract the intention of the verses from their literal meaning? Because the commandment is indeed that they may marry only within the family of their father's tribe. Perhaps the reason it was difficult to state explicitly is that if it were explicitly commanded, it would not have been necessary to say \"for their own benefit they may marry,\" as it is possible that other tribes would be preferable in their eyes. And if the commandment had been stated as \"only within the family of their father's tribe,\" it would have been understood that it is for their own benefit within that tribe, as after the inheritance was given to them, there would be no limitation on whom they could marry.(Bava Batra 121a)",
                    "–",
                    "It can also be said with a necessary reason that this interpretation, that they were permitted to marry men from all the tribes, is based on the opinion of Rabbi, as stated in Bava Batra 109b. In every portion regarding inheritance, it is stated that it shall be given to them, as it is stated: \"And you shall give [the inheritance]\" (Numbers 36:4). In the case of a daughter, it is specifically stated: \"And you shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter\" (Numbers 27:8), because you can transfer inheritance from one tribe to another only through a daughter. This is because when she builds her own family and marries, her sons inherit from her, and her husband also inherits from her. For example, Serach, the daughter of Asher, married Chanoch, the son of Reuben, and he died without male children. Serach, his daughter, inherited from him, and when Serach died, her son or her husband, who were from the tribe of Reuben, inherited her portion. Thus, the inheritance of the tribe that belonged to the tribe of Reuben was transferred. Therefore, in the case of the daughters of Tzelafchad, it is also written using the language of transfer: \"And you shall cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them\" (Numbers 27:7). It is explicitly stated that their inheritance shall be transferred from one tribe to another, according to the meaning and indication of the language of transfer, as explained. Therefore, it is necessary to understand that when it says here \"only within the family of their father's tribe shall they marry,\" it is merely a good advice, as explained, because it is impossible for the inheritance to pass from one tribe to another at all. And the reason why this interpretation relies on the phrase \"for their own benefit they may marry\" and not on the phrase \"and you shall cause to pass,\" is because it intends to clarify the matter and the order of the verses in its place, and its significance in this portion. This needs further analysis. In the Gemara, it explains that even though it is written \"every daughter who possesses an inheritance from the tribe of her father's family shall marry a man from the tribe of her father\" (Numbers 36:8), all this applies to other women and not to the daughters of Tzelafchad. Perhaps the reason is that they were important, as explained in the portion of Pinchas, so they were considered under special circumstances. (Bava Batra 120a)"

                    "Regarding that which we have previously written that the essence of the Mitzvah not to take the mother bird with its offspring is not to be cruel, do not challenge me using the Mishnah from Berachot 33b on which the Gemara says [the prayer leader is to be silenced] because he implied God's commandments come from mercy while they are Ordinances, from which one it would seem that the reason for [the Mitzvah] has nothing to do with \"mercy\".  This conclusion does not present a difficulty because the intent for which are obligated to observe God's Mitzvoth is only as they are \"Royal Ordinances\" and not because of the reason deduced [from them].  Were that the case, it would be [too] possible to stray from the true path by relying on the reasoning and inclination of each individual, as it is written in Tractate Sanhedrin (21b), \"Why are the reason for Mitzvoth of the Torah not revealed? Because the two instances in which the reasons were revealed led the Gadol Haolam (King Solomon) to stumble\". "
