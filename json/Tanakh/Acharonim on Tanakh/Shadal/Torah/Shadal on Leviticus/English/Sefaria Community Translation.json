                "It's not that Nadav and Avihu sinned on account of drunkenness, because they hadn't been taught to drink wine when they woke up on that glorious morning, but they died on account of their having added something that the Lord had not commanded them, the Lord wanted to catalyze Aaron and his sons that they should be careful with matters of the service, that they should not switch even one small thing. And, behold, it was as if he said, \"I knew that from this day forwards, you will not willfully do anything from your own minds, but now I am commanding you to be careful from accidentally going against my commands. And, therefore, you shall drink neither wine nor beer when you come into the Tent of Meeting, lest you come to change something. And not only that are you being warned with the activity of service, but also when you provide guidance to others in matters of holiness-vs.-sanctity, purity-vs.-impurity, or other matters of particular statutes of the Lord, you should be careful to not drink, lest you err in guidance or their sins to the Lord.\""

                "The prohibition to eat [certain foods] is to separate [the Jewish people] from the nations and also to uplift the soul because eating disgusting things leads to a lessening of the soul. And, the reason [for kashrut] is not for health reason because camel meat is good for health and is beloved by people of the east."

                "\"Do not bear a grudge (\"titur\")...\" According to the simplest understanding, the grudge is [a form of] revenge after a period of time, similar to [Nahum 1:2] \"and he bears a grudge for his enemies.\" (R. Naftali Hirz Wessely)",
                "All other transgressions against one's fellow man are objectively immoral, except for revenge, which seems like justice. Therefore, 'love your fellow as yourself.' Just like you don't want others to take revenge on you, so you should not take revenge on your fellow, even though you are in the right to take revenge. And so too in all other ways you should love your fellow as you love yourself. And Moses Mendelssohn interpreted it as \"You shall love your fellow in all the ways of love that you love yourself,\" equal in quality of love and not in its quantity, whenever there is no conflict between two beloved things. However, that's similar to the trait of a Sodomite (what's mine is mine and what's yours is yours [Pirkei Avot 5:10]), for how can I benefit my fellow without causing myself loss or effort, light or heavy? For there will always be a conflict between my benefit and other people's benefit, and there is no way to give a perutah to my friend without losing a perutah from my pocket."

                "LOVE HIM LIKE YOURSELF: The nations of the ancient world would only love their own people, and they would defraud other peoples because they saw them as despicable foreigners. Therefore, it says here, that you need to love him like yourself, and act toward him just as you would want. You  should act towards him as you would want other people to act toward you if you were a foreigner. This is in accord with what is written several verses earlier (Leviticus 19:18): \"Love your neighbor (re'ah) as yourself\""
