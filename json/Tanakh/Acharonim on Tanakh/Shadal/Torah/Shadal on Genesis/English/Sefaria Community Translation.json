                "The enlightened ones will understand that the intent of the Torah is not to inform about the natural sciences; and that the Torah was not given except to straighten the ways of man to righteousness and justice, and to establish in their hearts the belief in [His] unity and providence, since the Torah was not only given to sages but [rather] to the whole people. And just like the matter of providence and reward is not explained (and it would not have been fitting that it be explained) in a philosophical manner, but the Torah [rather] spoke about it like the language of [ordinary] people ([as in] \"the anger of the Lord will flare against you\" [Deuteronomy 7:4]; \"and it grieved His heart [Genesis 6:6]; and there are many [other examples] like this); so too, the matter of creation is not told (and it is not fitting that it would be told) in the Torah in a philosophical manner. And it is as the Rabbis, of blessed memory, have stated (Midrash HaGadol, Genesis 1:1), \"To tell the power of the story of creation to flesh and blood  is not possible.\" Hence it is not fitting for the follower of Torah to uproot the verses from their understanding in order to make them agree with the natural sciences. It is also not fitting for the scientist to deny that the Torah is divine (<i>min hashamayim</i>) if he finds things in its stories that don't agree with natural science. But it is fitting for this one and that one, that they contemplate the inner workings of human hearts and the ways of wisdom that is used by nature in speaking to the heart of every individual: to the youth according to his manner and to the young man in a different manner and to the old man in a different manner [still]; to the strong in a particular manner and to the weak in a particular manner; to the rich man in one manner and to the poor man in another manner; and so [too] with all groups of men, nature speaks to their hearts in a specific way that is fitting to the people of that group. And nature does not reveal the pristine truth - without any mask or cover - to any one of these groups. And so [too] the Giver of the Torah, may He be blessed, (since the God that created nature and the God that gave us the Torah is one God.) in his speaking with people was required to speak according to their levels, and not according to His level, may He be blessed. And behold, God wanted to inform people of the unity of the [universe] and the unity of mankind; since error in both of these matters caused great evils in ancient times: from the lack of awareness of the unity of the [universe], it came out that people would believe in the existence of specific gods, with defects and inferior character traits; and they would do evil acts in order to please [these gods] (see what I have written in Parshat Yitro on the verse, \"There shall not be for you\" [Exodus 20:3]). And from the lack of awareness of the unity of mankind, it came out that the people of one nation would hate and revile the people of another nation and they would act towards them with the force of arms, and not with justice and righteousness. And these two fundamental principles (the unity of the [universe] and the unity of mankind) are the main point of the stories of the creation saga; and details of the book also include other intentions, as will be explained. ",
                "<b>In the beginning, God created:</b> Many have already been disturbed [about] why there is no proclamation for the creation of the heavens and the earth, and why the creation of the angels is not mentioned. And one should also wonder why the first day is different from the other days of the creation; since every one of them is dedicated to a specific thing or to specific things of one type or one category. But the first day includes a specific thing which is the creation of light, and besides this [also] includes something general - and there is nothing more general than it - and that is the creation of the heavens and the earth. This is something very strange, and it would have been fitting to designate one day for the creation of the heavens and the earth, without attaching to them the creation of something specific - which is the light - on one day. And it appears to me that one answer will suffice for [all] three of the questions, and that is that the heavens and the earth were not created on the first day but before then. And this is according to what is said (Berakhot 25b), \"the Torah was not given to the ministering angels\" - and [this means] that the story of creation is only coming to tell the beginning of matters of the lower world - which is the habitation of man -  and a little of the matters of the upper world, from the angle of that which is relevant to people, which is to say from the angle of that which is useful for us [to know]. And it would not have been possible to explain to people all the matters of the heavens; but [at the same time] it was [also] not His will, may He be blessed, to bring people to believe that nothing exists except that which we see and [empirically] know. Therefore, the Torah tells what was created and made on each one of the six days of creation; and it began the story of the details of creation with one verse that includes a different creation that came before the six days - and its details were not explained in the Torah - in its stating, \"In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth,\" and not stating, \"And God said, 'let there be heavens, let there be earth.'\" This is to inform that it is not His intention to tell us the details of that creation and that this is just a vague statement which contains many, many statements. And behold, the heavens and the earth mentioned here are not exactly the heavens and the earth mentioned on the second and third day. Rather the heavens mentioned here includes everything above the earth and the heavens mentioned on the second day includes only the portion from them that is known to people. And the earth that is mentioned here includes the earth that is mixed up with water, and upon which was the wind/spirit, [whereas] the earth mentioned on the third day only includes the dry land. That is, in my opinion, the main simple explanation of this verse. And lest someone say that this contradicts what comes in the Ten Commandments, \"because in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth;\" there is, in fact, no contradiction to my explanation from there, since it does not say, \"because in six days the Lord <i>created</i> the heavens and the earth,\" but rather, \"because in six days the Lord made;\" and the intention [there] is about the making of the firmament and about the separation of the earth from the water. And the words, \"and all that there is in it\" that are said in [the continuation of] the Ten Commandments include the light and the luminaries and the animals that are upon the earth and in the midst of the seas. And in Parshat Ki Tissa (Exodus 31:17), it shortened it and only mentioned the heavens and the earth, and included in them every thing that is in them. Also the Sages, of blessed memory, said (Pesachim 54a) that the Throne of Glory came before the creation of the world. <b><i>Bara</i> (created):</b> The verb, <i>bara</i>, in the simple structure and in the passive structure, is never found in any place  with reference to human action. And we find that a man is called a doer and a former, but we don't find any place where man is called a creator (<i>boreh</i>). And it appears that this root is used to indicate anything that deviates from that which is the way of the world, as per, \"I will make wonders which were not created (<i>nivrau</i>) in all the earth\" (Exodus 34:10); \"and if the Lord creates (<i>yivra</i>) a creation and the ground opens its mouth\" (Numbers 16:30); \"I let you hear new things from now... they were created (<i>nivrau</i>) now and not from before\" (Isaiah 48:6-7); \"because the Lord created (<i>bara</i>) something new on the earth\" (Jeremiah 48:7); and here God created (<i>bara</i>) the heavens and the earth, a Godly act which has nothing like it. We find creation from nothing (<i>ex nihilo</i>) explicitly [mentioned] in the Book of Maccabees, Book II 7:28; and also the Samaritans say that the world was created from nothing in their liturgical poems, and it is also [included in] the faith of the Karaites. And Yechezkel, when speaking about the king of Tyre, used the expression, <i>briah</i> about him: \"on the day you were created (<i>hibaraecha</i>), they were established\" (Ezekiel 28:13); \"from the day you were created (<i>hibaraech</i>)\" (Ibid., 15). He poetically compared him to Adam, whom God created and placed in the Garden of Eden, which is as it is stated [there], \"you were in Eden, the garden of God;\" hence, he used the expression <i>briah</i>, as if [to say] that he was not formed through a father and mother; instead he was a creation that God created. And in the intensive (<i>piel</i>) structure, we find the root, <i>bara</i>, indicating chopping and cutting (Joshua 17:15; Ezekiel 23:47); and in the causative, \"<i>lehavriachem</i> (to feed yourselves)\" (I Samuel 2:29), [to indicate] a matter of health and portliness. And in some [versions] of II Samuel 12:17, we find <i>bara</i> in the simple structure [as follows]: \"and you did not create bread,\" with a [letter,] <i>alef</i> instead of a [letter,] <i>hay</i>. And that was the version [in front of] Rabbi Avraham Ibn Ezra, and it was not the version [in front of] Rabbi David Kimchi.   <b><i>Elohim</i> (God):</b> <i>El</i> and <i>eyal</i> is always an expression of power and strength and <i>elohim</i> is the plural form; and this was [the accepted terminology] of the nations that worshiped idols (Kuzari 4:1). And they would call all of the forces of nature that are the causes of phenomena, [<i>elohim</i>], and they would worship them; and each one of them would be a god for them. However, the Hebrews, who were monotheists, kept this name in the plural to indicate that the God that they were worshiping was not [just] one specific power. As the non-Jews would say, \"the Lord is the god of the hills and not the god of the valleys,\" (I Kings 20:28) but [in fact] He is the collection of all the forces and the Master of every force. (And similar to this is the word, seas [<i>yamim</i>], see below, verse 10). So [too] is He called by the name, 'Hosts,' to say that He, Himself, contains all the powers of all of the hosts of the Heavens which the non-Jews would worship - see my commentary on Isaiah 1:9.  ",
                "<b>The heavens and the earth:</b> The Torah spoke as in the language of men and divided the whole world - and all of the worlds - into two parts; that which is above and that which is below, everything according to the eyes of man that dwells upon the earth. <i>Sama</i> (which is similar to <i>shamayim</i>, the word used here to mean heavens) in Arabic, is like <i>gava</i> (high) in Hebrew; and <i>ara</i> (from which comes  <i>araa</i>, which is the same as <i>arets</i> [earth], when switching the letters, <i>ayin</i> and <i>tsaddi</i>, as in <i>tson</i> [in Hebrew] is <i>aaan</i> [in Aramaic], and <i>ravats</i> [accordingly turns into] <i>rava</i> - and from which comes <i>arbaah</i> [in the Targum to Isaiah 7:25] - and also <i>ir</i>, which is a designation for an angel, is like <i>tsir</i> in the Holy Language - the understanding of which is, messenger) is lowly in the Aramaic language, as in (Daniel 2:39) \"And after you, a king more lowly (<i>ara</i>) than you will arise.\" And according to the opinion of some (Galius and Clericus), <i>sama</i> and <i>ara</i> are derived from [the Hebrew], <i>shamayim</i> and <i>arets</i>. And plausible are the words of Rabbi Yaakov Abendana: that <i>shamayim</i> is from <i>sham</i> (there), which indicates a far place - and it is called <i>shamayim</i> from its being far and high from any direction that one turns. And nonetheless, [it was] from <i>shamayim</i> that the Arabic verb (<i>sama</i>) that refers to height, was afterwards derived. Since, truly, it is not possible that verbs that do not indicate an action, but [rather] the characteristic of something, like the verb <i>sama</i> - the understanding of which is 'being high' (<i>altus fuit</i> in Italian) - exist before the existence of the noun or adjective that refers to that characteristic. For example, first the blood of animals was called <i>dam</i>, and afterwards, [people] called that which appears like the color of blood <i>adom</i> (red), and afterwards [still], they made the verb and said <i>odem</i> (redden), <i>odmu</i> (they redden), and similar to it. But [concerning] <i>ara</i> - which is an adjective [to describe] all low things - it is plausible that they said it, before they called the earth, <i>araa</i>."

And so [too] in Syriac: <i>atbahaba</i> is a matter of stupefaction and <i>bohbaha</i> is wonderment and disorientation.

It is an expression of disorientation and wonderment, except that it is used specifically about the abundance of waters and their depth - as they have no end. And the intention [here] is that the whole earth was <i>tehom</i>, since the waters were covering it and it was not visible. And there was no light on the face of this <i>tehom</i>, but [only] darkness. And behold, this is a frightful image - desolation below and desolation above.",

And [the reason] it did not state, 'blowing' (<i>minashevet</i>) is because it did not blow like that which is the way of the world, [which is] that the wind blows in one direction, but [rather] all of the air was moving in every direction. And some explain <i>ruach Elohim</i> (the wind/spirit of God) as the will of God and His power and His providence. And besides [the fact] that the term, <i>richuf</i> does not sit well with regards to the Upper One, it would be very correct that the entire verse would speak in description of what was at the beginning, and [only] afterwards tell of God's action, which was sudden and in an instant - since it is no more than a statement (\"And God said, 'let there be light'\") - and not say that God or His will or His power was moving on the waters, as if He had been putting forth effort and involved [with this] for a long time. And also this description of the wind that was - at the beginning - blowing in every direction, teaches us of the kindnesses of God on His creations; since now it is ordered according to the laws [of nature] that God imprinted on His world. And had the world remained in chaos - as it was then - the wind would have always blown powerfully in every direction or not moved at all, and the creatures would not have been able to exist. "

                "<b>\"Let there be light:\"</b> It appears to me that it is for [the following] reason that He [started] with the creation of the light: Since most nations worshiped the sun because of its great [effect] on [people], through [its] light and heat; hence, He started [with it] to make known that also before there were luminaries, there was light and there was day and night, as everything [only] existed through the word of God."

And there was already in the time of Rabbi Avraham Ibn Ezra, someone who wanted to explain that the night comes after the day and [subsequently] that Shabbat begins in the morning; and he explained \"and it was morning, one day\" [to mean] that when it was the morning of the second day, then was the first day finished. And against this did Rabbi Avraham Ibn Ezra write <i>The Epistle of Shabbat</i>, to elucidate the character of the year and the month and the day that are mentioned in the Torah (and I have already published this epistle in the fourth volume of <i>Kerem Chemed</i>).

However, according to this, there is no reason for the verse to mention the structure of the day of creation, since it is not the Torah's day.

And this is not a sufficient solution, since, in truth, immediately at the end of the first day, the night began and that is the beginning of the second day, and [so] it would have been possible to call the first [day], first. And behold, the preeminent usage of the word, 'day' is regarding the time of the light. And afterwards they [continued to] call it day, alongside [calling day] the time that includes the night and the day - that is to say, twenty-four hours. And so [too] in the other languages (<i>Dies</i>, <i>jour</i>, <i>Tag</i>), one word, by itself, indicates [both] the light of the day and also the span of twenty-four hours.

                "<b>\"Let there be a firmament:\"</b> The Holy One, blessed be He, wanted to inform Israel that neither the sun nor anything else controls the rain, to bring it down or not to bring it down. Therefore, He told about the existence of the higher waters before the existence of the luminaries. <b>\"Firmament (<i>rakiya</i>):\"</b> [It is] a body that stretches out like a plate, [as in] the expression, \"To the One that stretches out (<i>rokea</i>) the earth over the waters\" (Psalms 136:6);  \"And they flattened (<i>yiraka'au</i>) the gold [into thin plates]\" (Exodus 39:3); and [also] \"And over the heads of the living creatures there was the likeness of a firmament, like the color of the terrible ice\" (Ezekiel 1:22). And here it portrayed the air between the earth and the clouds as a body that extends and separates between the waters on earth and the waters in the clouds, and carries the waters upon it; and by the will of God, the water descends from there to the earth. And it is like it states (Deuteronomy 28:12), \"And God will open for you His good storehouse, the heavens, to give the rain of your land in its time;\" and in the Curse, when it states (Leviticus 26:19), \"And I will give your skies to be like iron,\" to prevent the descent of water upon them; and so [too] below (Genesis 7:11), \"and the windows of the heavens opened.\" But afterwards, in the time of Yishiyahu, it appears that they knew that there are no storehouses of water above, and that rain waters return above; since behold, he says (Isaiah 55:10), \"For just as the rain and the snow come down from the skies, and do not return there except when the earth is satiated;\" [which] implies that after it is satiated, it does return to there, see my commentary there. And so [too], Yirmiyahu said in the way of a question, \"do the heavens give raindrops?\" (Jeremiah 14:22); [which] implies that [the heavens] do not give them by themselves, since they do not have storehouses of water in them. And so [too], they called the vapors that rise up from upon the earth [and become clouds] the name, <i>nissi'im</i> (raised up ones), as [in], \"He raises <i>nissi'im</i> from the end of the earth\" (Psalms 135:7); \"He raised the <i>nissi'im</i> from the end of the earth\" (Jeremiah 10:13; 51:16); and so [too], \"<i>Nissi'im</i> and wind, but no rain\" (Proverbs 25:14). And we do not know from what time this word (<i>nissi'im</i>) became common; as Psalm 135 is not attributed to David and it is not clear that the Book of Proverbs from Chapter 25 is by Shlomo. And in Job, he says (Job 38:22), \"Did you come to the storehouses of snow, did you see the storehouses of hail?\" - and this is a proof of the antiquity of that book. And since the word, <i>rakiya</i>, is based on the belief in higher waters - \"the waters that are above the heavens\" (Psalms 148:4) - that the <i>rakiya</i> supports, and that belief became antiquated and forgotten; the word, <i>rakiya</i>, also became antiquated. And [<i>rakiya</i>] is only used to indicate the skies in three [other] places. Two are in Psalms - \"and the acts of your hands, does the <i>rakiya</i> proclaim\" (Psalms 19:2); \"praise Him in the <i>rakiya</i> of His strength\" (Psalms 150:1) - since the word remained in poetic use; as it is the custom in all languages for the poets to use antiquated words. And the third place is in Daniel 12:3, \"And the enlightened ones will shine like the splendor of the <i>rakiya</i>;\" and there also, it is a poetic expression. And so [likewise], in Malachi 3:10, \"I will open for you the windows of the heavens,\" is by way of poetic expression. And we have also found a variant of <i>rakiya</i> referring to the heavens in Job 37:18, \"<i>Tarkiya</i> (Did you spread out) the skies with Him;\" and this too is a sign of the antiquity of this book. And he finishes [this verse], \"they are as strong as a molten mirror,\" as they carry the weight of many waters. And  so [too] did Shlomo say (Proverbs 8:28), \"And in His strengthening of the skies above.\" And behold, the Torah spoke as in the language of people, and stated, \"let there be a firmament,\" according to their thought (that it actually existed). And nonetheless, what was intended does not deviate from being true and solid, and that is that God implanted in the nature of water to rise upwards and to descend afterwards down to the earth. And in the Greek translation attributed to the seventy elders (the Septuagint), <i>rakiya</i> is translated as <i>strauma</i>, [which] is a matter of strength, and so [too] did they translate it afterwords into Latin [as] <i>firmāmenta</i> and this came to them  from the use of the root, <i>raka</i>, in Syriac, which denotes strength; and so [too], <i>rakiya</i> in Syriac is strong and hard. And Johannes Clericus says that they translated it thus, because it was the opinion of some of the ancient philosophers that the heavens and air that surround the earth on all sides, prevent it and everything on it from getting detached and crumbling apart; and behold, they cause the earth to stay hard and its parts to remain fastened together. And he explains the expression to be one of hitting and trampling, as in \"hit with your hand and stamp (<i>reka</i>) with your foot\" (Ezekiel 6:11); \"because you hit with your hand and you stamped (<i>rakacha</i>) with your foot\" (Ezekiel 25:6); because the heavens are stamping on the earth and stopping its parts from detaching. And all of this is far from the simple meaning of the verses. And  nonetheless, [his] words, that the origin of the root, <i>raka</i>, is from stomping and hitting, are plausible. And because something that is hit [becomes] flat and stretched out, the root, <i>raka</i>, is borrowed to indicate stretching out and flatness.  "

And Rabbi Ovadia Sforno says, that <i>deshe</i> is animal food and <i>esev</i> is food for people. But what the commentator on Netivot Shalom wrote - that <i>deshe</i> also includes trees - is not possible, since behold, we find [this word] in many places adjacent to herbs and vegetables (for example II Kings 19:26; Isaiah 15:6; 37:27) and not even once adjacent to trees. And nonetheless, [when used as a verb here in the phrase], \"Let the earth bring forth (<i>tadshe</i>),\" [it] includes the trees also, since the trees also are small and soft at the beginning of their sprouting (My student, our teacher, Rabbi Avraham Chai Meinster). And behold, \"<i>tadshe</i>\" is like, \"let sprout\" and afterwards [the verse] explains [what should sprout]: the <i>deshe</i> which is the smallest, and afterwards, it adds <i>esev</i> that gives off seed - which is bigger than <i>deshe</i>, and afterwards, it adds fruit trees. And therefore the cantillation sign, <i>ravia</i>, which is on top of the word, grass, is correct, since it creates less of a pause than the sign, <i>zakef</i>, which is on top of the word, seed; as grass and herbs [that bear seed] are one matter and fruit trees are another matter.  And the sign, <i>pashta</i> over the [word,] earth, creates more of a pause than the <i>ravia</i> after it, as is the way of any <i>ravia</i> that comes after a <i>pashta</i> since it is [only there] so as not to repeat the  <i>pashta</i> three times, as [is also the case in] \"Behold, I have made him a lord over you, and all of his brothers have I given to him as slaves\" (Genesis 27:37).

And the error in the first [of these two verses] came about because it is easy to mix up a <i>ravia</i> with a <i>zakef</i>, besides [the fact] that there is a <i>pashta</i> in front of it, and it is its way to come in front of a <i>zakef</i>; while no error in the second verse came about because it is unlikely to mix up a <i>tilsha</i> with a <i>zakef</i>, besides [the fact] that there is no <i>pashta</i> in front of it there.",

I, 70) was in doubt about the creation of man, if the Creator of all created him from divine seed or whether the earth which had then recently been separated from the skies included some heavenly seed [and engendered him]. And the divine Torah informed us that both man and animals were [created] by the command of God and not by chance.  ",

                "<b>\"Beasts\" (<i>behema</i>):</b> It appears to me that he beginning of this word's usage is with reference to four-legged herbivorous animals that do not prey, like the bull and the sheep, the horse and the donkey; and this is its usage in this verse, and in any place it is juxtaposed to <i>chaya</i> (wild animals). And it appears to me that its main connotation is the opposite of the cruelty of wild animals; since in Syriac, its root indicates softness and goodness - the opposite of harshness. And so did I found in the works of Master Ephraim (S. Ephraem the Syrian), Section 3, page 614, \"<i>Tivdi letaiboutach, debah <u>bahemin</u> negdaich</i>\" - the intention [of which] is: Is it not up to us to give thanks to Your attribute of kindness, since within it [even] the afflictions that You afflict us with are <i>softened</i> and sweetened? (And it is translated into Latin as: <i>Gratiâs misericordiae tuae maximas agere debemus, quae justitiae severitatem mitigat</i>.) And sometimes the name, <i>behema</i>, is borrowed to include all animals besides man, as in (Psalms 36:7), \"you save <i>behema</i> and man, O Lord;\" and sometimes it does not include [other] animals, only four legged [ones], whether they be domesticated or wild.",
                "<b>\"And <i>remes</i> (crawling animals):\"</b> \"These are the creeping things, which are low and crawl upon the earth and appear as if they are dragging along, because their movement is not discernible\" (Rashi). And <i>remes</i> is different than <i>sherets</i> (creeping animals), since it does not include flying creatures and fish (Johannes Clericus); since a <i>remes</i> [by definition] must crawl on the earth, as <i>remes</i> is [derived from] <i>remisa</i> (treading). However, the root <i>remes</i> is also used with [reference to] all four-legged animals, as in (Psalms 104:20) \"in it crawls (<i>tirmos</i>) all the animals of the forest;\" and also all the birds [are included], as in (Genesis 7:21) \"And all flesh that crawls (<i>romes</i>) on the earth perished, among the fowl and among the beasts and among the animals and among all the creeping animals that creep on the earth and all men.\" And observe that it does not state [in the verse just quoted], \"among all men,\" but [rather] \"and all men;\" since man is not included in \"all flesh that crawls upon the earth.\" Rather, he is a different specie and separate from them. And the author of the cantillation marks also understood thus and [so] separated [that part of the verse] with an <i>etnach</i> (which denotes a pause) before \"and all men.\" And the reason is that when animals and birds walk, their bodies are flat and laying (horizantal) upon the face of the earth; which is not the case with man, who walks with an erect posture, and his body is straight (vertical) upon the earth. And this is also the opinion of Ramban, who wrote, \"because [animals] tread on the ground with their entire bodies.\"",
                "<b>\"And animals of the (<i>chayeto</i>) earth:\"</b> Animals that eat meat and prey are called <i>chayot</i> due to their liveliness (<i>chiyutam</i>) and their strength, [which] is how [liveliness] is understood in (Exodus 1:19), \"they are lively.\" And they are called\"<i>chayot</i> of the earth\" and \"<i>chayot</i> of the field\" (Genesis 2:20). And the word, <i>chayeto</i>, with the addition of a [letter,] vav [at the end of the word which does nonetheless not change its meaning] is like \"<i>beno</i> (the son of) Be'or\" (Numbers 24:3), and \"<i>lemayano</i> (to a spring of) water\" (Psalms (114:8). And the word, <i>chayeto</i>, is only found in verse [and not prose], and so [too] <i>beno</i> and <i>mayano</i>. And it appears that this is an Aramaic mode of expression [for] the son <i>of</i> Be'or, as in (Song of Songs 3:7), Behold, the bed of Shlomo (<i>mitato shel Shlomo</i>); in the manner of (Daniel 2:20) \"the name of God.\" And even though water (<i>mayim</i>) [in Psalms 114] is not singular, and earth [in our verse] is not masculine, the additional <i>vav</i> [which usually indicates masculine gender and first person] remains due to the poetic style, even when it would have been fitting to change it according to [the word's] standard grammatical form."

                "<b>\"Let us make:\"</b> It appears to me that this is also an ancient mode of expression, in the way of Aramaic. And the intention is not that He should consult with others, like angels; since it states \"in Our image,\" and man is not in the image of the angels. It is also not an expression of honor, like the speech of kings [who refers to themselves as 'we']. Rather, this is the way of Aramaic, as in (Daniel 2:36) \"and its interpretation will we say in front of the king;\" and Daniel would not have used an expression of honor for himself when he was speaking with the big king (as is attested by Rabbi Avraham Ibn Ezra). And this manner [of speaking] is used frequently by the Talmud Yerushalmi and the midrashim: for example, \"[Shimon ben Shetach] said to [Yannai], 'And what should we say [to introduce the Grace over the Meal], \"for the food which we have not eaten?\"'\" (Yerushalmi Berakhot 7:2); \"I too, we will solve it according to the opinion of the rabbis in the graveyard\" (Shir HaShirim Rabbah on the verse \"O, my dove, in the clefts of the rock\" [2:14]); and also, \"Were it only that I had a mother and father that I could honor, so that we would inherit the Garden of Eden\" (Yerushalmi Peah 1:1). And Ros. wrote that this is the way of the Holy Language (Biblical Hebrew), to [use] plural when [speaking] about [one]self, as in (II Samuel 24:14) \"Let us please fall in the hand of the Lord.\" And that is not a proof, since David was not speaking only about himself [in that verse], but [rather] about himself and about his people. And so [too] with Rechavam  when he said (I Kings 12:9), \"What do you advise and we will [respond] to the people\", since he combined himself with his advisers;  and so [too] Avshalom when he said (I Samuel 16:20), \"give your advice, [about] what we shall do.\"",
                "<b>\"Man:\"</b> [This is] the name of the species, as in sheep or cattle, and therefore, He said, \"and let them have dominion,\" in the plural. It appears that the name <i>adam</i> (man) is derived from <i>adom</i> (red), not from <i>adama</i> (ground), since the animals were also formed from the ground. But man is differentiated in his body from animals in that his body is not full of hair and his skin (in moderate climates) is reddish.",
                "<b>\"In our image\" (<i>tsalmeinu</i>):</b> The form of the body and its build is not called <i>tselem</i> but rather <i>toar</i> or <i>tavnit</i> (as Rambam said in the Guide for the Perplexed 1:1). Since they would say  <i>yafat toar</i> (nice appearance), not <i>yafat tselem</i>. And to indicate the construction of the parts of a body, they would say, \"the <i>tavnit</i> of the tabernacle and the <i>tavnit</i> of all its vessels\" (Exodus 28:9). Rather, they would call <i>tselem</i> anything that is made to resemble something else, like a drawing on paper made to resemble a specific person; and so [too] any statue or mask made to resemble a certain body. As it is written (I Samuel 6:5), \"the resemblances of (<i>tsalmei</i>) your hemorrhoids and the resemblances of (<i>tsalmei</i>) your mice;\" and (Ezekiel 16:17) \"and you made resemblances of (<i>tsalmei</i>) males;\" and (Ezekiel 23:14) \"resemblances of (<i>tsalmei</i>) Chaldeans, inscribed with vermilion.\" And the word, <i>tselem</i> is derived from <i>tsel</i> (shadow) (and like Bochart also wrote), since a shadow depicts a form which resembles a body. And from it did men learn to begin the art of drawing. And also in Aramaic, they say a 'golden <i>tslam</i>' [to mean a golden statue] and the like; and the intention is always about something that is made to resemble something else. Only once do we find - in Daniel 3:19, \"and the appearance (<i>tselem</i>) of his face changed\" - [that it refers] to the appearance of a living person, and it is a borrowed expression [there] and not precise. And behold, man is a resemblance of God; meaning that from a certain angle, he resembles the Power that is Master of all the powers. And ostensibly, the letter <i>bet</i> (designating in or according to) in the word <i>betsalmeinu</i> is difficult according to my explanation - and so [too] (Genesis 9:6), \"since <i>betselem</i> (in the image/resemblance) of God did He make man.\" Since according to my explanation, man himself <i>is</i> the resemblance of God, and not [just created to be] in the image of God. However, it is fitting to know that we have found this in a few places - an additional <i>bet</i> in a word that [simply] indicates that it is the predicate of a statement (<i>praedicatum</i>). For example, \"since it is <i>be</i> evil\" (Exodus 32:22);   \"Behold, the Lord will come <i>be</i> strength\" (Isaiah 40:10); \"He is <i>be</i> one\" (Job 23:13); \"<i>be</i> the Lord is His name\" (Pslams 68:5). And this [type of] <i>bet</i> is frequently used in Arabic. And it appears that the expression, <i>be</i> evil, <i>be</i> strength, <i>be</i> one [all] mainly indicates [that it is] as if you would say a certain person has the characteristic that is called evil, strength or [oneness]. Here too, [it is understood as] \"let Us make man [to have] the quality which would justify it being called, resemblance of God.\" And behold, the word, <i>betsalmeinu</i>, and the expression, <i>tselem Elohim</i> (image of God), are not a proof that the Torah teaches that God has a human form (<i>Antropomorphismus</i>). And we cannot deny that some of our forbears attributed a build like the build of a man to God, and so did they say in the blessing for grooms (Ketuvot 8a), \"Who formed man in His resemblance, in the resemblance of the image of <i>tavnito</i> (His build).\" And <i>tavnit</i> is certainly a name that refers to the structure of the parts of a body. And nonetheless, our forbears did not believe that God and the angels had a body and a hull like us. And Rashi explicitly wrote (Makkot 12a, s.v. <i>chamuts begadim</i>) that angels are not flesh and blood. But the truth of the matter is that a completely incorporeal simple intellect that has no form - no breadth and width and height whatsoever - is something that is impossible for a person to imagine and [hence] it will not be [internalized by him.] And if the philosophers speak about Him, at the end of the day, they can only describe Him negatively (what He is not), not positively (what He is). And the Torah was given to the whole people, and the people need to be able to imagine their God with a positive description, not just a negative description. And behold, [therefore] our forbears would attribute to God and to the angels and to souls, a finer spiritual substance than any body known to us, and nonetheless, [that substance] has a form and a build. And see the book <i>Malakhet Machshevet</i>, <i>Parshat Shelach Lecha</i>. ",
                "<b>\"<i>Ke'demuteinu</i>:\"</b> In similarity to Us - that He be similar to Us. However, in what way is man similar to God? It appears to me (like I wrote in <i>Bikkurei HaItim</i> 5588, page 165) that [just] like God is the Master of all powers - and that is the connotation of the word <i>Elohim</i> - so too is man distinguished from all the other animals; in that all of them have an ability and makeup for a specific trait and activity, and only man has the makeup and ability for all of the traits and activities in the world. (See Rabbi N. H. Wessely's <i>Sefer HaMiddot</i>, Section I, Chapters 1 and 2). And from this it comes out that he has dominion over all the animals; and for this reason, He immediately said, \"let them have dominion over the fish of the seas, etc.\" And so [too] did David state (Psalms 8:6-7), \"And You have made him little less than angels, etc. You have made him govern over the works of your hands.\" And behold, with man, it does not state, \"and it was so,\" since it does not state, \"let there be man,\" but [rather], let Us make man. Due to the stature of man, He fashioned him as if it were 'a thought-out work,' and as if he was made with more special supervision and attention than all the other animals. ",

And one of my students answered, that [the crawling animals] are a general category [that can come] after the [listing of] individual parts; as if it said, \"And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the heavens and over the beast and more generally, have dominion over all of the earth and over all that crawls upon it.\" And \"the crawling animals that crawl upon the earth\" will include all of the animals, and [it is] like it says in the verse that is after this, \"and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the heavens and over all of the animals that crawl over the earth.\" And I say that other animals are called \"flesh that crawls on the earth,\" [and] \"animals that crawl upon the earth; but the phrase, \"the crawling animals that crawl upon the earth\" is never found in any place to refer to all animals, but rather only to the crawling animals. And behold, in the verse after this, it is written \"and subdue it\" about the earth itself - therefore, the words of Ramban are plausible, that here also, when it states, \"and over all the earth,\" the intention was about the subduing of the earth itself: to dig, to plant and to build homes and to to do with it according to our will. And afterwards it mentions the crawling animals, because of their being (as per the words of my student, Yosef Yira) close to the ground. Hence, after He said that they should have dominion over the whole earth, He added that they should have dominion also over the crawling animals, which appear as if they are clinging to it and a part of it. And the intention is that in man's working of the earth, he expels and destroys the crawling animals that are in it. "

And behold, He gave to man all seed bearing herbs and all fruit trees; and to the other animals only the green herbs, which grow without planting. And the intention of this is because man has the intelligence to plant, and this is not the case with other animals. And it should not be derived from this that fruit of trees were forbidden to animals, like the opinion of Grotius; or that [here] Moshe did not speak with exactitude like the opinion of Clericus, when, in fact, the language is very exact. Since He did not give control to other [animals] over seeds and the fruit of trees, as He did not give them intelligence to sow and plant in all places that they would want, like He did for man. And behold, one should ask why He didn't mention the eating of meat - not with man and not with animals. And many already believed that the slaughter of animals was not permitted before the flood. And this is very unlikely; since in his nature and the build of his body and the shape of his teeth, man is fashioned for the eating of both [plants] and meat as one; and if it was not the will of the Creator that he should eat meat, He would not have formed his body [in this way]. And it appears to me that the permission to eat meat is included in the expression, \"and have dominion over the fish of the sea, etc.\" Since [in the case of] Noach (Genesis 9:2-3): after He said, \"and your awe and dread will be upon all the animals of the earth, etc... into your hands are they given,\" He explained and said \"every crawling thing that lives on the earth, for you shall it be to eat.\" But to Adam, He did not need to explain further, while with Noach; because it was necessary to warn him about the spilling of man's blood, he preceded [that warning] by saying that He was not forbidding the slaughtering of animals. And one can add that the proclamation, \"have dominion over the fish of the seas,\" is a clear proof that the killing of animals was permitted - since, how is it possible to rule over the fish without their coming out of the water and [so] dying? And one cannot say that the intention is to make fish oil and use their teeth after they die, since dominion and rulership is not the use of something [when it is] dead, but to rule over a living body, whether to subjugate it or to kill it. And that which they said [to answer this question] (Sanhedrin 59b), \"one used a goat and a mullet to lead [his chariot],\" that is not something common [and hence not a good answer]. And my student, Shalom Shimon Modina answered (today, the 23rd of Tammuz, 5625) that there is no absolute proof from here that Adam was permitted to eat meat. Since it is nonetheless possible that the intention of the proclamation, \"have dominion over the fist of the sea, etc.\" is that man should have dominion and rulership over the animals by preventing them from ruling over him and hurting him, and that their killing be permitted to save ourselves - but not to eat them. And even without the fish having to serve man and do his work, behold, that is called dominion over them, since it is in his hand to overpower them that they should not hurt him. And I say that we never find the root, <i>reish dalet hey</i> (have dominion) with this usage, but [rather] to indicate subjugation, and the rulership to force others to [submit] to our will and our pleasure, as in (Leviticus 25:53) \"he shall not subjugate him with hard work in front of your eyes,\" and (Leviticus 26:17) \"and the ones that hate you will subjugate you,\" and so [too] (I Kings 5:4), \"Since he ruled over the entire bank of the river,\" and (Psalms 72:8) \"And may he dominate from the sea to the sea:\" their sense is control [over] them to take taxes. And at this point, it appears to me that the Holy One, blessed be He, did not want to say to Adam explicitly that he had permission to kill living souls, so that he not accustom his hands to spilling blood. Rather, He said to him that he would rule and have dominion over all animals; and the permission to kill them for the sake of eating them 'was not explicitly said, but implicitly said.' But after the flood - after the earth was filled with violence and all flesh had corrupted its way and the spillers of blood proliferated - then did God explain to Noach and his children that they have permission to kill and eat animals, but they do not have permission for 'a man to kill his brother,' though they should kill murderers."

It's also possible that in a state of great emotional excitement one would be too wonderstruck and stunned to kiss the other person; perhaps this was the case with Yosef and Ya'akov. However, regarding Ya'akov and Esav there's no doubt that there was no great affection between them, certainly not the type of excitement that would lead to being wonderstruck and stunned."

                "<b>And they pulled and lifted Joseph from the pit, and they sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites.</b> Most of the world believe that the brothers of Joseph sold him, but the Rashbam writes that this was not so, and the Chizkuni agrees with him. My friend and son of my uncle, my teacher and rabbi R. Shmuel Chaim b. David Lo-Li zt\"l, delved deeply into the topic of this story, and he tended to the understanding of the Rashbam. He wrote about his opinions to be in a letter (28 Kislev 5589), and these are his words in explanation of this story: <br>When Joseph's brothers saw him in the distance, they plotted to kill him: \"And they said... let us go and kill him...\" But Reuven heard and saved him immediately, and advised them to cast him into the pit (in order to save him from their hand). They followed his advice and cast him into the pit. Afterwards, they returned to eat bread, and they distanced themselves from the pit, so as not to hear the cries of Joseph as he begged them, as the verse testifies, \"Since we saw the aggrievement of his soul, when he begged us and we did not listen to him.\" While they were eating, they lifted their eyes and they saw some Ishmaelites. Judah said, \"Let us go and sell him, etc.\" His brothers listened to him, i.e., they all agreed that after they finished eating, they would return to the pit and lift Joseph from there, and bring him to the Ishmaelites to sell him to them. (Since no hint is found in the verses that the Ishmaelites needed to come close to Jacob's sons on their way.) Meanwhile, while they they were speaking amongst themselves, far from the pit—behold!—without any of them knowing, Midianite men, merchants, crossed over by the pit (by Divine Providence). The Midianites pulled and lifted Joseph from the pit and brought him to the Ishmaelites and sold him to them for twenty [pieces of] silver. They brought Joseph to Egypt.<br>Now, behold! after they ate, Reuven hurried by himself, separating from his brothers without them seeing, and returned quickly to the pit to lift Joseph out and return him to his father before his brothers could reach him to lift him out and sell him. However... as the melting of wax before the fire, so melted Reuven's heart and became water as he gazed into the pit, where Joseph was no longer. He tore his garments [in mourning], for he thought in his imagination that without a doubt, a bear or a lion hunted [Joseph] for its cubs, suffocating him to take him as its prey. It had carried him off alive, as he was, his head on his thighs and on his stomach, to some hole or to some den, to fill its hole with prey and its den with game. And that was why he didn't find any blood or bones!<br>Reuven returned, in grief and in panic, to his brothers, and he cried and said, \"Hei! The boy is no longer, for he has been ravaged! My plan, like yours, has been ruined! Now where do I go? I am guiltier than you all, because it was by my advice that you threw him into the pit, and it is as if I were the cause of his death!\" All his brothers believed him and were astonished about this, as if G-d answered them that their brother should die. However, they were not pained, but glad to know that the one they hated was dead, without them having to lay a hand on him. Hence, they did not respond.<br>After this, they discussed what to do to also save Reuven also from the accusations of their father. Accordingly, they dipped Joseph's coat in blood and sent it to their father, in order that he believe that Joseph was hunted down before he reached them.<br>Now, when Jacob's sons came to their father, and they saw how Jacob mourned so exceedingly for his son, they regretted immediately everything they had done. But, what was to be done? If Joseph was already ravaged and had become the food of beasts of the field, all that remained for them to do was to comfort him with words, and so they did.<br>Now, according to this [following], it will be clarified that the children of Jacob, the tribes of Y-ah, which He chose as His unique ones, were not wicked, guided by their evil inclinations; nor were their deaths such that it be said of them, \"They will be torn forever. His wrath and His fury will keep eternally.\" Even if in a small moment they had sinned out of jealousy and hatred, since it is the way of people to be unjust, they could not, Heaven forbid, have remained in their rebellion. It would have abated quickly, they would have recognized their sin, and regretted everything they had done. They were exerting themselves with all their power to cleanse themselves of it, since when they all returned home, no man held back any of their courage and strength to console their father.<br>That none of them sought out Joseph was because all of them fully believed without any shadow of a doubt that he was hunted down, and there was no hope to bring him back alive. That Reuven was silent when he heard the Judah's suggestion to sell Joseph was with the intention to conceal his good thoughts concerting Joseph from his brothers, so that his brothers not monitor him carefully to see what he was doing when he went alone to the pit. This was especially so after he heard Judah's suggestion, and he knew, or at least it appeared to him, that his brothers did not oppose Judah, the master among the brothers, and none disagreed and all were silent in deference to his suggestion. If he were to reveal his mind to them, they doubtless would not allow him to go alone to the pit as he had planned, lest he prevent them to doing to their brother as they wished. It is also understood why none responded to Reuven when he said to them, \"The boy isn't there!\" They should have said, \"We sold him,\" but instead, they did not respond, because they did not sell him, and they did not know what had happened to him any more than did Reuven.<br>It is also understood why Joseph said, \"I was verily kidnapped.\" It was because he was talking about the Midianites who actually kidnapped him and took him away from the land of the Hebrews, since he did not suspect that his brothers sold him from the outset to the Midianites. Regarding what is written after this, \"And the Midianites sold him to Egypt,\" by his understanding, these were the Ishmaelites mentioned above, since in his understanding, \"Ishmaelites\" is a general term including all the children of Abraham aside from Isaac, and possibly these were descendants of Medan the son of Abraham. Even though the Midianites who sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites were themselves descendants of Abraham, they were certainly different people who were not true Ishmaelites. We cannot say that the sellers and buyers were one and the same, so they were called by a borrowed name separate from the sellers. There is further proof that the Ishmaelites and the Midianites are one and the same, since Scripture says here, \"And the Midianites sold him to Egypt to Potiphar,\" and after that it says, \"And Potiphar bought him... from the hand of the Ishmaelites.\"<br>And, after these words and truth, it will no longer be difficult to explain one verse that was repeated twice, which appears as if in contradiction to this structure. This is the statement of Joseph to his brothers when he admitted to them, \"I am Joseph your brother, whom you sold to Egypt. Now, do not be distraught... that you sold me here,\" since the intention here is this: \"You are the cause of my sale and coming to Egypt.\" This is similar to \"and Solomon built the House. The Shadal [Samuel b. David Lo-Li] said that it is possible to add other, further examples, like, \"And you will bring my hoariness down in grief to the grave\" (below, Genesis 42:38), \"You have killed the people of G‑d\" (Numbers 17:6), \"And this city shall burn with fire\" (Jeremiah 38:23). Similarly, his brothers, in their hatred, were the reason Joseph was sold to Egypt. The proof of this, that in any case, they did not sell him to Egypt, is that it would have been sufficient [for Joseph] to say, \"You sold me.\" Similarly, he says after this, \"You did not send me here.\" It is understood that they did not send him, but were the cause that he be sent to Egypt.<br>If you wish to explain the verse, \"I was verily kidnapped,\" according to all the commentators, that the intention was regarding his brothers who kidnapped and sold him, then you would also be able to say that Joseph, when he saw the Midianites who pulled and sold him like masters, did not know who the kidnappers were: Were they the brothers? or were they the Midianites?<br>Perhaps he thought in his imagination that his brothers sold him to the Midianites from the outset, and therefore said to them in his admission, \"whom you sold.\" If you would argue that if the brothers did not sell him, they would not be silent when he said to them, \"whom you sold,\" then the rebuttal is by your side. The brothers were not able to answer him [at all], not even the question, \"Is my father still alive?\" because they were confounded before him. How could they be so brazen as to bicker with him about their sin?<br>Until here are the words of the one dear to my soul, Samuel Chaim b. David Lo-Li zt\"l. Even though I do not agree with him on all the details of the explanation, the main thing here is that his words and the words of the Rashbam are correct in my view: it appears to me that those who pulled Joseph out of the pit were the Midianites and they sold him to the Ishmaelites, and Jacob's children did not see or know about any of this at all. Joseph believed that they sold him to the Midianites and said to them, \"Go pull him out of the pit.\" Joseph's brothers never said to him that they didn't sell him, since in speaking about it, it would be revealed that their intent was that he die in the pit. How could they say to him, \"Don't think that we sold you. It was only in our heart that you die in the pit. When afterwards we agreed to Judah's suggestion to sell you, the Midianites got there first and sold you themselves!\" The reason for \"I was verily kidnapped\" was regarding Joseph's brothers, who (in Joseph's belief) sold him, and kidnapped him from his father."
