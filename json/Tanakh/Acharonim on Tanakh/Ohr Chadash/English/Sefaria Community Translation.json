            "<b>In the book of Proverbs</b> (9:1) – “Wisdom (of women) has built her house, etc.” In the Midrash (Midrash Mishle 9:1): “Wisdom (of women) has built her house […] She has slaughtered her slaughtering and also set her table” (Proverbs 9:1-2) – that is Queen Esther: At the time that distress came to the Jewish people, she prepared a meal for Ahasuerus and for the wicked Haman, and she got him very drunk with wine. Yet Haman thought to himself that she was giving him honor and did not know that she set a trap for him. As, by getting him drunk with wine, she acquired her people [for herself] forever. “And also set her table” – in this world and in the next world. What is this? [It] is the good name that she acquired. For, in the future, all the festivals are to be abolished; but the days of Purim will never be abolished, as it is stated (Esther 9:27), “not to be passed over.” Rabbi Elazar said, “Also Yom Kippur will never be abolished, as it is stated, ‘And it will be to you for an everlasting statute.’” To here [is the Midrash]."
