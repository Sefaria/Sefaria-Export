                "<b>And the name of the second was Ruth:</b> (Rut. 1:4) The disciples of the Ari write “Ruth and Na’amah were “two virtuous fledglings”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See BT Baba Kama 38b, “The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to him: That which has entered your mind has not entered Mine, because I have two virtuous fledglings [feridot tovot) ], i.e., girls, to extract from them: Ruth the Moabite, who will be the foremother of the dynasty of David, and Naamah the Ammonite, Solomon’s wife, from whom the continuation of that dynasty will emerge. For the sake of these women, the Moabites and Ammonites must not be destroyed.” (Sefaria) Also see Rashi on Numbers 31:2</i> upon which the kingship of Israel was built. Ruth is the mystery of <i>Malchut</i>, and Na’ama is the mystery of <i>Binah.</i> Since <i>Binah,</i> the upper land<i>,</i> is hidden, husks do not have contact with it. It provided Rechabam with enough merit to give birth to a Messiah. But his generation was not worthy, the enlightenment of <i>Malchut</i> was minimal so she revealed slowly so that they were troubled. It was necessary for there to be a great man with vast power (Is, 40:26) who would defeat Israel’s accusers. This person was none other than David, king of Israel, and the sweet singer of Israel, (ll Sam. 23:1) who satiated the blessed Holy One with songs and praises.” From this we may explain what Rechabam said (of his father, Solomon), ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s loins.” (I Ki. 12:10) Anyone who heard this must have been shocked; how could Rechabam portray Solomon with so few virtues? But it makes sense if Rechabam knew the strength of his mother, the mystery of <i>Binah,</i> and that with little merit he could be the progenitor of the Messiah. That is why he said, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s loins.” This comment appears in a slightly different form in what our teacher, the Arizal, wrote in <i>Shaar HaPesukim, Parshat Vayera: “Na’ama</i> is from <i>Binah</i>; she is called <i>Noam Adonai, “</i>The beauty of Adonai,” (Ps. 27:4) Because she comes from the <i>Sephirah</i> of <i>Binah</i> there is very little connection to husks in her, nor were there all the souls. But Ruth is <i>Malchut,</i> the world that is revealed which clings to the many husks in the world that is revealed. All the souls of the house of David until the Messiah were included in her. These two daughters are Ruth And Naama.” This is what he writes in brief.<br>It may be that Rehoboam said, “My little finger is thicker than my father’s loins.” (I Ki. 12:10) is because his mother was connected to the <i>Binah</i> so that there is no connection to the husks and she was not in need of clarification since he was just born from her. But Ruth had to give birth to Obed who gave birth to Jesse. King David was despised and hated by his father until Samuel the prophet came, as I have explained in other places…<br>According to what has been said in the statement, “He (Solomon) had a throne placed for the queen mother and she sat on his right,” (I Ki. 2:19) refers to Ruth who was the mother of royalty since all the souls of the kings were included in the house of David.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Rashi on I Kings 2:19. Also BT Baba Batra 91b</i> It is quite correct that she was the mother of the monarchy. The first letters of the words <i>V’shem hasheinit Rut,</i> “And the name of the second one was Ruth,” spell <i>Riva</i>, because she satiated the blessed Holy One with songs and praise. That is why Ruth’s name was not changed when she converted since the name hinted at David. Why was she called Ruth because she was the ancestor of King David who satiated the blessed Holy One with songs and praise to God."

                "<b>May Adonai deal kindly with you, (as you did with the dead and with me.)</b> It seems that according to the sages, for gentiles thoughts are not joined to actions. Naomi makes this point when she said, “May God deal kindly with you as you did…” In other words, it specifically speaks of actions and not thoughts. However, the blessed Holy One does not withhold the reward of any being. What then was the purpose of this prayer? It is possible that Naomi’s prayer was beyond their reward - it meant, “May God deal kindly with you beyond the requirements of the law.” You have done more than was required by the law; so may God treat you kindly according to the <i>Torah</i> of kindness."

                "<b>For wherever you go, I will go; wherever you lodge, I will lodge; your people shall be my people, and your God my God.</b> The sages say in <i>Masechet Yevamot,</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See BT Yevamot 47b The passage continues, “Naomi said to her: Four types of capital punishment were handed over to a court with which to punish those who transgress the mitzvot. Ruth responded: “Where you die, I shall die” (Ruth 1:17). Naomi said to her: Two burial grounds were handed over to the court, one for those executed for more severe crimes and another for those executed for less severe crimes. Ruth responded: “And there I shall be buried” (Ruth 1:17).</i> “Naomi said to her: It is prohibited on Shabbat for us to go beyond the Shabbat limit. Ruth said: “Where you go, I shall go,” and no further. Naomi then said: It is forbidden for us to be alone together with a man with whom it is forbidden to engage in relations. Ruth said: “Where you lodge, I shall lodge.” Naomi said: We are commanded to observe 613 commandments. Ruth responded: “Your people are my people.” Naomi said: Idolatrous worship is forbidden to us. Ruth responded: “Your God is my God.”<br>There is a reason for this order. First Naomi mentioned the Sabbath because Israel was commanded regarding the Sabbath before Mount Sinai because the Sabbath teaches us about the Divine, that the blessed Holy One created the world and is the Master of everything - this is the essential teaching. Also the Sabbath teaches us about the special status of Israel; they are the children of the Holy One and are allowed to imitate God’s ways. This is not so for the gentiles who are considered slaves and cannot hold the King’s sceptre. This was an important matter for Ruth; when she converted she would gain the status of a child of God, like the people of Israel.<br>Naomi then mentioned forbidden relations because one cannot use the scepter of the King, as Radbaz<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>David ben Solomon ibn (Abi) Zimra</b>: (1479–1573) also called <b>Radbaz</b> (רַדְבָּ\"ז) after the initials of his name, was an early Acharon of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries who was a leading posek, rosh yeshiva, chief rabbi, and author of more than 3,000 responsa (halakhic decisions) as well as several scholarly works.</i> wrote in his responsa. Now that they were commanded about the Sabbath and they had the status of “children,” they were still warned about forbidden relations and even regarding a man and woman being alone privately so that they should not say that a child may use the king’s scepter for forbidden relations that are permitted for Israelites. That is to say, that they are on the level of a mortal child but on the level of a slave they must obey God’s decree.<br>From this it goes on to talk about obeying the 613 commandments - they must obey them as servants. The conclusion is a type of beginning - it begins with praise and concludes with idolatry. For our God is the essence and there is no other - so we must observe His commandments. One who transgresses is punished with four types of death penalties as the passage goes on to say. And some would say that the statement, “We are forbidden to worship idols,” is meant to include that even the thought of idolatry is considered like actions. So when Ruth said “Your people are my people,” she accepts the commandments and when she says “Your God is my God,” it is because <i>Adonai Elohei Yisrael</i> has the numerical value of 613."

The reward is not given until one leaves this world. Then, God in His mercy, repays each person even if his deeds are not complete. In this case there is no debt or surety. How can one claim the principle since it is all considered charity and acts of loving kindness so there is no judgment in the case of a debt or a surety. But God’s kindness is made great and he rewards one’s actions, so that one receives full recompense of the fruits that are born from the planting of commandments.\r<br>It is about this that Rabbi Chasa has two questions. First, if one plants commandments and fruit come forth and God, in His goodness, gives the one who performs the mitzvot recompense, why did Boaz have to offer a prayer asking for this? And furthermore the verse should have said, “And <i>Adonai</i>, God of Israel, under whose wings you have sought shelter will give you reward for your actions and it shall be full recompense.” To this Rabbi Chasa answers, this is the case from the time of conversion onward, but not the act of conversion itself since Ruth was not an Jew yet. Therefore ,Boaz prayed that the <i>mitzvah</i> of conversion would also be planted for good and that Ruth would be rewarded for the fruit of her conversion and she would profit in the recompense for her act with <i>Adonai</i>, God of Israel, as God did with the people of Israel. And if you ask why do I need a prayer for this (Boaz offers a prayer on behalf of Ruth), “under whose wings you have sought refuge!” That is, Boaz states, “I am speaking about the act of conversion in my prayer.” Rabbi Chasa points this out, by placing his good name before the statement, “Coming under whose wings..”"

Samuel di Pam, rabbi at Livorno, calls himself a pupil of Ḥagiz. About 1657, Ḥagiz left Livorno for Jerusalem, where the Vega brothers of Livorno had founded a beit midrash for him and where he became a member of the rabbinical college. (Wikipedia)</i> explanation in <i>Korban Mincha</i>: (S. 115) “Israel heard. The sons of Jacob were twelve in number.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The full verse states, “While Israel stayed in that land, Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, his father’s concubine; and Israel found out. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve in number.” (JPS translation)</i> (Gen. 35:22) the sages state in a <i>Midrash</i> on <i>Parshat V’Zot HaBerachah</i> that Jacob had been given the <i>Torah</i> and in this way Reuben was saved because he was exempt for having had relations with his father’s concubine. This is what the verse states, “Israel heard,” that he had the status of an Israelite and therefore, “The sons of Jacob were twelve in number.” If the sons had the status of Noahides, then Reuben would have been put to death for this act and there would not have been twelve sons of Jacob. That is what is stated, “The heritage (<i>morashah</i>) of the congregation of Jacob,” (Deut. 33:4) There was already a heritage or a tradition of betrothal for Jacob and his children that marriage is only finalized through <i>chuppah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Therefore, the concubine was not judged as one of Jacob’s wives according to Jewish law.</i></i> “Then he became King in Jeshurun,” (Deut. 33:5) this refers to Moses who gather all the heads of the people (and officially taught them the laws), “Numerous people is the glory of a king,” (Prov. 14:28) This is the reason for the statement, “May Reuben live and not die,” (Deut. 35:6) Because Rebuen was judged as a Israelite, he did not die as a Noahide. This is the essence of his explanation in short.\r<br>In my youth I wrote a treatise calle<i>d Rosh David</i> (P. 36) containing the opinion of Rabbi Chagiz, expressed in the introduction of <i>Parashat Derachim.</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A work containing twenty-six homiletic treatises on various subjects, by Rabbi Yehuda Rosanes. He (1657-1727) was a Rabbi of Constantinople. On account of his knowledge of Arabic and Turkish he was appointed by the government as chief rabbi of the Ottoman empire. He took a very active part in condemning and denouncing the Shabbethaians, and was one of the signers of an appeal to the German communities to oppose the movement. This work and others were edited & published by his devoted pupil Rabbi Yaakov Culi, author of Meam Loez. (https://seforimcenter.com)</i><i></i> I explained all of these verses there but I never found the <i>Midrash</i> on<i> V’Zot HaBerachah</i> that Rabbi Hagiz mentions. However, what was written on, “The heritage of the congregation of Jacob,” was explained there. And according to this one can explain, “O offspring of Israel, His servant;”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">offspring of Israel, His servant, O descendants of Jacob, His chosen ones.</i> (I Chron. 16:13) Israel - our forefather Jacob - received Torah and passed it onto his children so that Reuben was not guilty of sin and there would still be the 12 sons of Jacob. Some have written in homilies that Joseph the righteous assumed that they had the status of Noahides as the author of <i>Parashat Derachim</i> and others wrote. If this were so then Reuben would have been deserving of he death penalty (God Forbid!).\r<br>While it was Reuben’s righteous intention to save Joseph, he didn’t try hard enough, because he was afraid that he would find out that the law was according to Joseph and that they had the status of a Noahides. If he saved Joseph he might have brought evil upon himself. If he had known, however, that God would write that he would save Joseph from the brothers, in other words, similar to what the <i>Torah</i> states, “He tried to save him from them,” (Gen 37:21) and also, “Intending to save him from them in order to return him to his father.” (Gen. 37:22) (he might have acted differently.) His only intention was to bring Joseph back. This is what the Holy One wrote about him and it proves that he had the status of an Israelite for whom good intentions are joined to actions.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See BT Kiddushin 40a: “The Holy One, Blessed be He, links a good thought to an action, as it is stated: “Then they that feared the Lord spoke one with the other, and the Lord listened, and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before Him, for them that fear the Lord, and that think upon His name” (Mal. 3:16). The Gemara explains: What is the meaning of the phrase “and that think upon His name”? Rav Asi said: Even if a person intended to perform a mitzvah but due to circumstances beyond his control he did not perform it, the verse ascribes him credit as if he performed the mitzvah, as he is among those that think upon His name.” This however only applies to Jews and not non-Jews.</i> If, however, Reuven was considered a Noahide, then good intentions would not be joined to his actions. Since the blessed Holy One wrote that he had the status of Israelites, he had no fear that they would say that he had the status of a Noahide as Joseph claimed, and that he was guilty (of having relations with his father’s concubine). Then he would have carried Joseph on his shoulders back to Jacob even though Joseph thought the law was different. Still, Reuben saved him because he knew that one who saves an Israelite is as if he saved the whole world. And that is why one who performs a commandment should do so with a whole heart and not worry about suspicions or other matters. And we have heard about Reuben with whom damage would have resulted had he acted on his thoughts when they (the brothers) sold Joseph resulting in a step between him and death, and all the other events that would have come to pass. One might conclude that Reuben should have acted on his good intentions and not worried about those who disagreed.\r<br>But what if one’s action will not lead to such damages; should one worry about “the scorn of the complacent?” (Ps. 123:4) The <i>Midrash</i> brings proof to show that a person should still perform <i>mitzvot</i> with a wholeheart even if there is no danger of damage as in the case of Aaron. It is possible that Aaron thought that Israelites were considered Noahides when he saw what his father, Amram, did. Amram was one of the righteous people of his generation. He was one of four who died due to Adam’s sin with the serpent (and not because of his own sin).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">BT Shabbat 55b</i> He married his own aunt, Yocheved. According to <i>Targum Yonatan</i> when he divorced her she married Elitzafan ben Parnach but in the end, he remarried her and they gave birth to Moses. All of these acts would later be forbidden by <i>Torah</i> law.<i></i> As a result, Aaron concluded that the Israelites had the status of Noahides until they received the <i>Torah.</i> Amram could take his aunt as a wife, divorce her and then take her back as a wife because the <i>Torah</i> had not yet been given. However, in order not to cause the scorn of the masses, Aaron didn’t want to go out to meet his brother with “drums and dance” which would have given the people an excuse to talk about his family or Moses. That is why he went out to greet Moses privately. Even though there was no danger or suffering involved in this matter, he thought that it was better to worry about scorn of the people. Thus we learn that even in this situation, it is better to perform the commandment with a full heart... If Aaron had known that God would write, “he (Aaron) will be happy in his heart to see you.” (Ex. 4:14) he would have known that they had the status of Israelites and his analysis was incorrect. Amram had acted according to the word of God, as the <i>Zohar</i> comments on the verse, “A man from the house of Levi…” (Ex. 2:1), then Aaron would have gone forth with timbrels and dancing (when meeting his brother), to fulfill the commandment properly.\r<br>Further we also learn this lesson from Boaz. It occurred to Boaz and he saw through the Holy Spirit that he would marry Ruth. Further Ruth said, “Why are you so kind as to single me out, when I am a foreigner?” (Ruth 2:10) The sages comment, “To single me out,” in the way of all the earth. Boaz only gave her a little grain because he was fearful that people would say that he didn’t do so for the sake of a commandment but rather out of desire for her and in order to marry her. If Boaz had known that God would write about him, “He handed her roasted grain, and she ate her fill and had some left over,” so that it appeared as of he gave her a extra in order to satisfy her hunger, when in fact he gave her just a little bit but it was blessed, as the sage explain. But the blessed Holy One wrote that he gave her enough for her satisfaction. But if he really valued the <i>mitzvah</i> he would have given her fatted chickens! Further it states the details; it states that he said to her”“Come over here and partake of the meal, and dip your morsel in the vinegar.” and afterwards it states that he gave her roasted grains, all as part of a single commandment to feed her. Had Boaz known how important this <i>mitzvah</i> was, he would have fed her fatted chickens."

                "<b>Boaz gave orders to his servants (</b><i>ni’arim</i><b>) , saying (</b><i>leimor</i><b>), “You are not only to let her glean among the sheaves, without interference…</b> At first glance the word <i>leimor,</i> “Saying,” needs an explanation. The statement, “his servants” refers to one “who is in charge of the reapers,” (Ruth 2:5) whose job it was to make sure the workers acted properly according to the law. Among the servants there was one who was superior to rest. He is the one to whom Boaz spoke when it says, “to his servants who was in charge of the gleaners.” There were other workers with the gleaners and the poor.\r<br>Another interpretation: Later, it states, “in the field,” … his worker who was placed in charge of the gleaners. Now, when Boaz came from <i>Beit Lechem</i> he had a servant or two with him, as an important individual often has. To these servants and to the workers who were mentioned, he directed his comments when he said, “Boaz commanded his servants.”.(Ruth 2:15) . That is why it says, <i>leimor;</i> he said that the servants should say to the other gleaners, “You are not only to let her glean among the sheaves, without interference…” and he said to them, “Do not scold her.” It might be that because there were many poor people there as well as the gleaners themselves, when these people saw the servants showing great kindness to Ruth they suspected that they were doing it because of her great beauty, to get close to her. Because the servants feared God, they might scold her to show that they weren’t showing her favoritism but because they were so commanded. Rather she was in their eyes, a stumbling block. Therefore he said, “Do not scold her” lest damage result and she would not glean there.\r<br>Another interpretation: Because she is a princess and she is converting. Therefore it is not fitting to speak harshly to her for we are commanded to not to oppress the convert; how much more so when she is the daughter of the king!"

On the face of it, the expression, “Saying, “The name of the man…” would appear to be repetitive, since it was already written, “She told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked.” From this phrase it is clear that we know who the man was, and certainly that Ruth had already told Noami.

Because he would satiate God with songs and praises. Ruth’s name did not change when she converted and after miracles and wonders were performed for her because King David would be born through her line. Her name hinted that she avoided Boaz’s punishment and that she was not burned by his anger. Boaz did not curse or condemn her through the merit of King David, of blessed memory, who was born of her lineage. Through his merit, King David protected her. In place of a curse from Boaz gave her a blessing…in place of lying at his feet she resided in his soul and became his wife.

It would seem that what was written there was doubted by the author of <i>Mutzal M’eish</i>. He asks, if one had intimate relations with a married woman with intention to sin while her husband was overseas, and then it became known that her husband had already died, is it now permissible for the couple to marry? In my youth, I argued that it was permitted. A similar doubt arose with regard to Mahlon and Kilyon. They intended to have forbidden relations and they presumed that a Moabite woman was forbidden but actually this relationship was permitted. It would appear that they did not transgress a prohibition.
