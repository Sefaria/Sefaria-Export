        "Introduction": [
            "This holy book, as is clear from its composition, is a formal debate about the apparently unfair workings of Divine Governance.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew term is הנהגה – Governance, i.e., how God governs the world. The alternative term השגחה used is translated as 'Providence'; it is generally taken to indicate individual Providence.</i> <i>For there are righteous people who suffer the deserts of the wicked (Ecclesiastes 8:14),</i> <i>while there are wicked ones whose paths prosper…they grow and even produce fruit (Jeremiah 12:1-2).</i> <i>Yea, they vex God, yet escape capture (Malachi 3:15).</i> ",
            "This then is the question: 'Why do the righteous suffer and why do the wicked prosper?' The Talmudic Sages noted that even Moses, master of the prophets, had been baffled by this problem and had pleaded with God, '<i>Show me Thy Glory</i>.'<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Exodus </i>33:18. Malbim misquotes. The verse that actually appears in the Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 7a) is 'Inform me of Your ways' (<i>Exodus</i> 33:13).</i> For it is by reason of this question that <i>apostates have broken away (TB Megillah 25b; TB Sanhedrin 38b)</i> and denied Providence, asserting that the world is ownerless; that there is neither reward nor punishment, neither justice nor Judge, and thus God's honor is besmirched. As Maimonides wrote in his <i>Guide for the Perplexed</i> (Part 3, Chapter 16): <br><i>What induced philosophers to refute Providence and to deny its existence is that at first thought we notice an absence of system in human affairs. Some pious men live a miserable and painful life, whilst some wicked people enjoy a happy and pleasant life.</i>",
            "According to the Talmudic Sages, Moses was the author of the Book of Job (TB Baba Batra 14b). The Midrash explains that he wrote the book in order to comfort the Children of Israel during their suffering in Egypt.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The specific Midrashic source for this assertion has eluded detection. Perhaps Malbim is referring to the Midrash (<i>Shemot Rabbah</i> 5.18) that the Israelite slaves in Egypt possessed scrolls which they would read for relaxation during the day of rest - the Sabbath - that Moses had persuaded Pharaoh to grant them by arguing that it would increase the productivity of their labor. Other than the general promise that God would redeem them, the exact contents of these scrolls and what happened to them is not recorded by the Midrash. However, in his glosses on the passage in the Talmud that ascribes the composition of  <i>Job</i> to Moses (<i>TB Baba Batra</i> 14b), Rashi notes that Moses also composed <i>Psalms</i> 90 to 101. One of these compositions, <i>Psalm</i> 92, is headed '<i>A Psalm for the Sabbath Day</i>'. However, the Psalm makes no mention of the Sabbath. It does, however, relate to the same topic as<i> Job</i>, namely, the prosperity of the wicked and the suffering of the righteous.</i> Moses was the first to research and elucidate this problem. Employing the techniques of analysis and philosophical contemplation, he examined and investigated this subject before the Word of God was revealed to him. He recorded the results of his intellectual efforts and meditations in this book, in the form of a debate, wherein he mustered all the opinions and theories that can be rationally surmised in this matter.",
            "And so this story about <i>the greatest man in all the East (Job 1:3)</i>, of whom God Himself testifies that there is <i>no-one like him on earth, as sincere and genuine in his fear of God and avoidance of evil (Job 1:3 &amp; 1:8)</i>. This saintly man is handed over to Satan, to be tormented. His wealth and property is destroyed and his children all die. Finally, he himself is struck down with the most dreadful bodily afflictions.",
            "Convinced of his own innocence and that has neither sinned nor transgressed, he deems these visitations to be both unjustified and unwarranted. Notwithstanding, <i>he continues, and with integrity</i>, (Job 2:9) <i>to believe in true faith (Isaiah 25:1)</i>, that no injustice, lack of knowledge, power or will can be attributed to God, Blessed be He, whose Perfection is absolute. He is thus driven to conclude that this evil could not have ensued from God's Providence; that He does not oversee the deeds of individual persons, nor does He mete out their reward or punishment, their benefaction or their hurt. For He has delegated this task to the universal governance ordained during the six days of Creation—the governance of the Cosmos.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">הנהגת המערכת - governance of the Cosmos. As Malbim uses the term, it encompasses both Natural Astrology, which determines the movement of celestial bodies, and Judicial Astrology which determines how these movements affect sublunar (terrestrial) life.</i> Thus, God remains <i>just and true (Deuteronomy 32:4)</i> <i>and no guilt is to be found in Him (Psalms 92:16; Ezekiel 28:15)</i>. For since a person's deeds, whether righteous or evil, are all determined and apportioned by the governance of the Cosmos, he has no freedom of action and deserves neither reward nor punishment for his acts of volition, just as mill-stones, turned by flowing water, are neither rewarded if they grind the corn nor punished if they crush the head of someone who comes too close. And so, Job sets forth to campaign, <i>and stringing his arrows, he lets fly (Psalms 11:2)</i>, and employing powerful philosophical arguments, founded on pillars of inquiry and study, he attacks belief in Providence, in Divine reward and punishment, physical or spiritual, and in the existence of free-will.",
            "He is challenged in combat by three <i>champions, archers (1 Chronicles 12:2)</i>, on the side of Faith, resolved to demonstrate and prove that there is <i>a God who judges the earth (Psalms 58:12)</i>; <i>whose eyes watch over the ways of men, rewarding each according to his path, as his deeds warrant (Jeremiah 32:19)</i>; that man is master of his own deeds and has freedom of choice; and that God, through His personal Providence, is the sole Ruler of all the world's affairs, there being no other. And so they too, with wisdom and knowledge, <i>pinned their colors to the mast (Psalms 74:4)</i> in a spirit of investigative and philosophical contemplation. However, the heretic's arguments and proofs triumphed over their answers and so these <i>skilled bowmen turned and fled in the hour of battle (Psalms 78:9)</i>, <i>for the enemy prevailed</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Lamentations</i> 1:16. There is here is a play on the name Job in Hebrew – איוב, and the Hebrew word for enemy – אויב: the 'enemy' is Job! In seeking a possible explanation for why God had allowed such terrible afflictions to befall Job, some of the Talmudic Sages (<i>TB Baba Batra</i> 16a) speculated on the possibility that He had confused איוב (Job) with אויב (enemy). However, these musings are all refuted by their colleagues.</i>",
            "At this point, an accomplished and erudite young warrior <i>presents himself and audaciously (Psalms 20:9)</i> joins the campaign, full of spirit. <i>His tongue speaks mighty things (Psalms 12:4).</i> <i>The great were astonished by him,</i> <i>silenced and unable to reply (Job 32:15);</i> <i>tongue tied (Job 29:10).</i> ",
            "And following him, the voice of the Lord thunders forth, revealed <i>out of the Tempest (Job 38:1),</i> <i>hewing out flames of fire (Psalms 19:7),</i><i>The heavens proclaiming His righteousness:</i> <i>\"For God, He is the Judge – Selah\" (Psalms 50:6).</i> ",
            "It is well-known that in a book written in the style of a symposium (a philosophical dialogue<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to Malbim, the literary form of the debate in <i>Job</i> is that of a philosophical dialogue and so he expects to find in it all the features of this form.</i>) in which several persons participate and contend with one another, each basing his arguments on a particular philosophy, the number of different opinions being expressed corresponds to the number of speakers,. Were just two points of view being examined, the author would not have specified more than two participants, one posing the questions and the other replying to them. Accordingly, each of the three protagonists that the author [of the <i>Book of Job</i>] arrays against Job must represent a different method of inquiry, distinct from that of his companions. And, furthermore, the approach adopted by the fourth and last protagonist must be a wholly different one.",
            "Recognizing this to be so, Maimonides in his <i>Guide to the Perplexed</i>, and likewise <i>all the upright in heart (Psalms 94:15)</i>, sought to identify each debater with a particular philosophical standpoint. However, when they tried to explain and interpret the book's actual text accordingly, <i>none of these worthies succeeded (Psalms 76:6)</i>. For at first sight, there appears to be <i>a great confusion which destroys (Exodus 8:20)</i> any systematic pattern the book may have, from its beginning to end. Not only is order not maintained, as it should be in a scholarly debate, but neither are questions asked or answered to the. The topics should follow on from one another by way of ordered and systematic statements, in a logical and rational progression. Answers should relate to the questions previously asked and subsequent questions should be a rebuttal of the replies previously given. But everything is confused and disconnected.",
            "Furthermore, each of the protagonists appears to repeat statements that have been previously made, two or even three times. Each encroaches on the territory of the others, <i>stealing each others words</i> (Jeremiah 23:30) and ideas, and even contradicting what they themselves have said elsewhere. For example, in his final speech Bildad states: <i>What right has a man to require of God, and what privilege has he who is born of woman, that He should stop the moon from shining; the stars too, because he has found them wanting? Yea, for mortal man is but a grub and the son of man is maggot-feed (Job 25:4-6).</i> However, this passage is a repetition of remarks already made by Eliphaz on two previous occasions (Ch. 4:17-19 and 15:14-16). And besides, Job had already responded to this, twice, <i>and had made such nonsense of his words</i> (Job 24:25) that Eliphaz had not repeated it again in his third speech. So why does Bildad end his final exposition with these very same words, which in any case are so far removed from his way of thinking?",
            "Moreover, how can Job reply to him: <i>it is the lot of the wicked man - it is from God;</i> <i>...that if he has many sons - it is for the sword;</i> <i>...though he heap up money like dirt;</i> <i>...he may prepare, but the just shall wear it? (Job 27:13-17)</i> For these are the very words of his opponents and their reply regarding the punishment of the wicked. He had <i>been in full cry after them (Jeremiah 12:6)</i> throughout the debate; <i>his bow had remained resolute (Genesis 49:24)</i>. So why does he himself now <i>break the bow's flashing shafts (Psalms 76:4)</i> and speak as had his opponents, contradicting everything he himself had said previously?",
            "Many other strange and amazing things can be seen throughout the book. Consequently, in their attempts to elucidate the text, commentators have been forced to assume difficult and strange interpretations: <i>Darkness confounds them (Psalms 18:12)</i> <i>and fog envelopes them</i> (Job 38:9). <i>Neither lamp nor sun</i> (Psalms 74:16) <i>to light up the night</i> (Psalms 105:39); <i>and to show how brightly it shines in the sky above</i> (Job 37:21) <i>under God's heaven</i> (Lamentations 3:66). ",
            "The pathway I have cleared in explaining this book leads the reader directly <i>to a city of habitation (Psalms 107:7)</i>, bringing him to a place of <i>rest and inheritance (Deuteronomy 12:9)</i>, where he will discover <i>hidden treasures (Isaiah 45:3)</i>; <i>for a wise word is a precious jewel (Proverbs 20:15)</i>.",
            " Reader, behold this book, now open before you, written by a genius of unrivaled wisdom, in which, through the medium of a debate, he conducted extensive and profound researches; elucidating each issue rationally and with extraordinary philosophical insight.",
            "The protagonists stroll far and wide through the <i>Garden of Thought</i>, <i>pressing oil between the rows (Job 24:11);</i> <i>revealing all its precious gems (Job 28:10).</i> Everything that thought can either deduce or infer from such investigations <i>they poured forth, like water from a deep well;</i> <i>seeded in an abundance of moisture (Numbers 24:7).</i> ",
            "Each adopts a specific philosophical system upon which he takes up his position; <i>as in a fortress; (Psalms 61:4)</i> <i>counter attacking with great courage (Isaiah 28:6)</i> <i>with all available ammunition (Job 36:19).</i> ",
            "Each stands on his own ground. <i>The one does not jostle the other (Joel 2:8) </i><i>nor remove his neighbor's boundary mark (Deuteronomy 19:14).</i> ",
            "As I will show, none of the participants repeats anything twice, nor is anything mentioned before it should be or out of place. The ideas and the topics discussed intertwine like the boughs of a tree curling up out of its roots; <i>spreading branches, stretching out sprigs and bursting forth shoots (Ezekiel 17:6).</i> ",
            "And so there is no <i>superfluous talk</i>, (Proverbs 17:7) nor anything that is extraneous, remote or forced in the book. Its order and composition, its style and insights, are the mark and proof that it embodies God's wisdom and was written with inspiration from on High by that person [Moses] <i>like whom there has been no other in Israel</i>. (Deuteronomy 34:10.) ",
            "Not only does each protagonist adopt and expound a philosophy different from that of the others, but each also draws on a distinctive source, so that <i>the river flowing from the Eden of their wisdom divides into four separate founts (Genesis 2:10).</i> ",
            "Eliphaz garners the waters of his wisdom from those exalted fluids suspended by the Sovereign's Fiat;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The elevated waters are those above the firmament, i.e., the heavens - השמים (<i>Genesis</i> 1:6-8). Eliphaz claims to have prophetic knowledge; to have heard 'the whisper of a sound'</i> through a revelation from on high and a prophetic vision, <i>just the whisper of a sound (Job 4:16)</i>.",
            "Bildad is the exponent of tradition<i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Bildad's knowledge is traditional knowledge, the accumulated wisdom and experience of previous generations.</i> He pours forth his sources (Proverbs 5:16)</i>, from the well dug by the princes; unearthed by the wise men of antiquity, <i>by the scepter and their maces (Numbers 21:18).</i> ",
            "Zophar taps <i>strange, cold, flowing waters (Jeremiah 18:14)</i> from the founts of understanding and philosophy, and on the basis of abstract perception, by examination and drawing from what is subsequent that which was prior,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i&gt; What is subsequent - the observed physical phenomena; what was prior - the underlying principles, universals or general qualities:<br><i>We do not think that we know a thing until we are acquainted with its primary conditions or first principles and have carried our analysis as far as its simplest elements.

The natural way of doing this is to start from the things which are more knowable and obvious to us and proceed towards those which are clearer and more knowable by nature. So in the present inquiry we must follow this method and advance from what is more obscure by nature, but clearer to us, towards what is more clear and more knowable by nature. </i>(Aristotle's <i>Physics</i> 1, Ch. 1).</i> as is the method of the Peripatetic philosophers,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here, Zophar is identified as a follower of Aristotle, but Malbim interprets his speech in the first cycle in terms drawn eclectically from Kantian philosophy.</i> he assembled<i> his loft in heaven</i>, <i>its construction founded on earth (Amos 9:6)</i>.

            "Inasmuch as Job maintains his belief that no wrong or shortcoming can be attributed to God, and to assert that God governs but evil can nevertheless befall a righteous person or good betide a wicked person would be to imply an unfairness, lack of power or absence of knowledge on His part, he is driven to conclude that such decrees <i>do not emanate from the decisions of the Most High (Lamentations 3:38),</i> but from the blindfolded governance of the Cosmos (and therefore there is no injustice attributable to Him). <br>He formulates this, his fundamental thesis, in the form of a compound hypothetical syllogism,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The fact that the syllogism is not of Israelite origin, and was popular amongst Greek philosophers and medieval Christian scholastics up until the Renaissance, apparently did not worry Malbim.

            "Eliphaz and Bildad refute the minor premise - options (ii) and (iii) respectively; In refuting the subject of the minor premise, Eliphaz argues that though a person may not be so wicked that he deserves to perish completely, he may also not be so very righteous that he does not deserve some suffering.

He must have committed some sin for which he justly deserves to suffer. Refuting the predicate of the minor premise, Bildad argues that the righteous person is not really suffering, for by way of 'an exchange' the afflictions are really for his ultimate good and prosperity.

However, each has them representing different philosophical systems. According to Malbim, Eliphaz represents prophecy and Bildad is the spokesman of traditional theology, whereas Maimonides has Eliphaz representing Torah and Bildad representing Mu'tazilite philosophy. This rationalist Islamic philosophy postulated a law of exchange or reciprocity, according to which in return for the undeserved suffering a righteous person endures on earth, he is assured of compensation in the next world. God permits this suffering because, in His Wisdom, He knows that it will ultimately be good for the person's soul, as it will be recompensed for it in the Hereafter.</i>",
            "Zophar refutes the major premise - option (i): Repudiating the major premise, Zophar contends that even under God's government a righteous person could appear to suffer and perish. In the formulation of this premise, it was assumed that 'just' or 'unjust' are what our senses and experience consider them to be; and, likewise, that, our intuition can tell what 'perishing' or 'prosperity' are. However our senses perceive only the superficies of things; how they stimulate our sense organs and not the truth of what they are in themselves. We do not know what is inherently just or unjust, nor whether what we call perdition, suffering or prosperity is their true essential quality. For we perceive only the incidentals; we can only say that this is how we perceive the essence of the quality to be, through our senses. We cannot claim that our perception of the essence of an object is its true essence. This notion was known to the ancient philosophers.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reference may be to the ancient Greek skeptics (Xenophon <i>et alia</i>) who maintained that appearances never give us the reality of objects or to the Ash'arites with whom Maimonides had identified Zophar. Their mistrust of sense-perceptions, led the Ash'arites to deny the existence of causality or of any natural laws whatsoever. Hence, they asserted that everything happens through Providence, though man can decide whether or not to 'catch a ride' on it. And so, though he is not the cause of his acts, man chooses to perform them willingly or unwillingly. Ash'arism is the dominant theology in Sunni Islam.<br>Alternatively, the reference could be to Joseph Albo, who states in the opening to his <i>Sefer Ha-Ikkarim</i>:<br>…human reason is not capable of comprehending things as they really are...There must be something higher than human intellect by which praiseworthy acts can be delineated and real opinions comprehended, in a manner that leaves no room for doubt.</i> Modern thinkers too,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reference is undoubtedly to Immanuel Kant. In the eclectic tradition of Jewish theologians, Malbim seized upon Kant's revolutionary ideas about the subjectivity of space and time, viz., that they are the transcendental framework of our consciousness, and his distinction between 'phenomena', the external properties of an object which are accessible and can be comprehended by the mind, and 'noumena', the object's essential and eternal properties which are beyond human comprehension, and adopted this new epistemology, wherever it was useful, in support of his theological opinions and beliefs. Malbim was not the only Jewish orthodox writer who found Kant an aid to his theology (Rosenbloom, p.192-197).</i> in their critique of the nature of human understanding, <i>have found some discernment in it (Jeremiah 23:20).</i> (The introductions to the second, fourth and sixth orations).",
            "Undaunted, Job rebuffs everything they have to say. ",
            "He<i> clearly proves (Deuteronomy 4:35)</i> to Eliphaz that if a righteous person is made to suffer for some small sin, the very purpose for which man was created, viz. the attainment of perfection, is negated.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This idea of perfection is related to the Aristotelian concept of entelechy. Malbim's source for this might well have been the following passage from Albo's Ikkarim III,2.<br>There are two kinds of perfection, a first and last. The first is that perfection which a thing has as soon as it comes into being: the existence of existence. The other is the perfection which is only a potential in the thing, and which it attains only when its potentialities are actualized. Aristotle had distinguished between the first and second entelechy. Knowledge as opposed to ignorance is the first entelechy; the second entelechy is reached when one makes use of the knowledge.</i> Besides, his own case was one of a righteous man who had perished completely.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job asserts that his case is not just one of a righteous person suffering, but of a person being totally demolished by what had happened to him. The issue of exactly what is required for the attainment of perfection, whether it is the observance of the entire set of the Commandments - all 613 of them, or whether the keeping of each individual Commandment has an element of perfection in it, is discussed below, in the Introduction to the Third Oration, in the light of Albo's interpretation (Ikkarim Part 3, Chapter 29) of the dispute between R. Yochanan and Resh Lakish over the interpretation of Isaiah 5:14 (TB Sanhedrin 111a).</i> ",

            "and pours great scorn on Zophar's philosophy. He argues that man's mind was created with the ability to attain clear perceptions; his sense-perceptions are real perceptions and are the essential qualities of things. Man was not created to be made a fool of; a dreamer in an imaginary world. He is a citizen of the real world. It is inconceivable that his Creator made him for a joke and a prank;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Below, in the Introduction to the Seventh Oration, Malbim reasons that the covariance of human observations—the fact that different independent observers of an event agree with one another, or can be reconciled with one another—is proof of their truth. When discussing whether or not objective reality is an illusion, Descartes had maintained that though it is only through our mind's interpretations of our sensory experiences that knowledge of a world external to us comes, they are not all that exists: 'God, being perfect, would not be a deceiver; He would not make us believe in the existence of a material universe if it were not real' <small>(M.

            "For example, Bildad had argued that the absence of Divine Governance would be both unfair and a perversion of justice. To which Job counters, in the fifth oration, that it would not be so if one considers the reality of the overall 'becoming and demising'<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew term is עולם ההויה וההפסד הכללי. This concept is Aristotelian -  - translated variously as 'becoming and demising', 'creation and destruction' or 'generation and corruption' (Aristotle Categories 14,1). They are two of the categories of sublunar motion or change identified by the Aristotelian system, the others being growth, diminution, transformation and locomotion. The sublunar realm comprises the minerals, plants, animals and rational beings, all of which are composed of matter and form. The sublunar world (as distinguished from the celestial one) is constituted of the four elements, earth, water, air and fire and is subject to generation and corruption, i.e., to changes in the form of the objects found in it. The distinction between matter and form and their meaning is the subject of much philosophical debate. In simple terms, it can be said that an ingot of gold has its form changed when it is made into jewelry while its matter remains unchanged. According to Maimonides, the demise of physical objects is a circumstance of their matter and not of their form. Man's body is matter and his soul is form. The body dies; the soul is immortal.</i> nature of the world. ",
            "In the same speech, Job elaborates all the arguments raised by philosophers against Governance that are cataloged in the <i>Guide for the Perplexed</i> (Part 3, Chapter 20), including the paradox of knowledge and free-will, along with everything else that is derived from this. <i>Ranging deep and wide (Isaiah 30:33)</i>, <i>he passed them under his staff (Leviticus 27:32; Ezekiel 20:37)</i>, and employing powerful arguments he shows that if we assume the existence of free-will, we must deny God's knowledge of contingent particulars, otherwise the philosophers will demolish us with proofs that <i>smash with hatchet and hammer (Psalms 74:6)</i>. However, if we assume that everything depends on the governance of the Cosmos and man is constrained in his acts by reason of predetermination, then God's knowledge remains immutable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is one of the central issues of traditional theology. Governance requires that God has knowledge of all events. However, the knowledge associated with a free-willed event does not exist before the event is made to happen. If God is an absolute unchanging Unity, as He surely must be, how can we ascribe to Him knowledge of such events: new knowledge, which did not exist before the event? To do so is to imply that He is not unchanging, for a being is changed when it acquires knowledge. On the other hand, not to do so is to imply that He is ignorant of the event i.e. imperfect. Hence, the perfection and unchanging Unity of God require that there be no undesignated events, i.e., no new knowledge, and consequently no free-will.</i>",
            "Zophar also addresses this issue in the framework of his thesis that our knowledge is not real knowledge. This being so, he argues that <i>a fortiori</i> it is impossible for us to know anything about God's Knowledge. His views accord with those expressed by Maimonides in his solution to this matter (<i>Guide</i> III. 20, 21), namely, that the word 'knowledge' when applied to God, may He be Blessed, and to us, is a homonym, and we can no more comprehend His Knowledge than we can His Essence.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Maimonides wrote:<br>The homonymity of the term 'knowledge' misled people;...the words are the same but the things designated by them are different; and therefore they came to the absurd conclusion that that which is required for our knowledge is also required for God's knowledge. (Guide to the Perplexed, III:20)<br>The knowledge by which God governs is beyond human comprehension, God's knowledge being of His essence and not an attribute ascribed to Him. New human knowledge has no effect on God's knowledge - they are different entities. Just how they differ is not explained by Maimonides, but in his commentary to Isaiah 29:16 Malbim explains the difference between them in quasi-Kantian terms. Kant had postulated that time and space are an integral part of the mechanism of human consciousness, and that they have no independent existence. Man's knowledge exists in time and space. Malbim argued that God's knowledge is not a function of time and place and so it is inherently different from man's.</i> (The introduction to the sixth oration) ",
            "In his scornful dismissal of Zophar and his philosophical thesis, Job's view corresponds with that taken by Gersonides in <i>The Wars of the Lord</i>, where he argued that the term 'knowledge' applies equivalently to Him, may He be Blessed, and to us, priorly and posteriorly, and is not just a homonym. It being understood, at the same time, that it is impossible that His knowledge be designated as what, in us, is confusion or error.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gersonides wrote:<br>It would seem that His knowledge, may He be Blessed, is equivocal with our knowledge by priority and posteriority...The term 'knowledge' is said of God, may He be blessed, priorly, and of any other being posteriorly...There is no difference between God's knowledge, may He be Blessed, and our knowledge except that God's knowledge, may He be Blessed, is more perfect than our knowledge...Therefore it is impossible that His knowledge should be designated as what with reference to us is opinion or error or confusion. (The Wars of the Lord, Part 3, Chapter 3. - Norbet M. Samuelson translation).<br>Knowledge is divided into universals and particulars. God has absolute knowledge of universals which are eternal and are not subject to change, but He has prior knowledge only of those particulars which are derived from the universals; He does not have prior knowledge of those which arise from free-will and caprice. Some events therefore are pre-determined and some contingent. However, His subsequent knowledge of contingent events is perfect, so He remains perfect.<br>A third solution suggested to this problem is the Neoplatonist postulate of a Logos, a transcendental intellect standing between God and man to whom knowledge and Providence is ascribed rather than to God himself.</i> <br>Accordingly, Job remains steadfast in his opinion <i>and does not abandon his position</i>, (Isaiah 46:7) denying both Governance and the possibility of free-will. He brings as evidence that we often see people coerced to act in a certain way, even <i>the sons of one man together</i>, (Psalms 133:1) such as when an heretical sect<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Possibly a reference to the Reform and Liberal Jewish movements with whom Malbim fought a running battle throughout his working life.</i> <i>rises over them (Judges 18:9),</i> <i>leading them astray (Job 12:17 &amp; 19),</i> <i>and their hands are helpless to save them (Job 5:12).</i> (The introduction to the seventh oration).

            " The companions cannot refute the second syllogism—that which relates to the prosperity of the wicked—by disputing the subject of the minor premise as Eliphaz had done in the First Act. For though we may suppose that a righteous person may have sinned in secret, it cannot be suggested that a wicked man is really a saint. Nor, after Job had so scornfully dismissed the principles of his philosophy, is there any point in returning to the attack led by Zophar on the major premise; no purpose is served in trying to convince someone on the basis of assumptions and principles that he repudiates. Consequently, they all now turn their attention to the predicate of the minor premise, namely, that the prosperity of the wicked is not genuine, though each chooses a different tack. <br>With regards to Job, they all now consider his case to be <i>an example and a byword (Ezekiel 14:8)</i> of that of a wicked man who had prospered. This had become clear to them from the great effort he had invested in his attempt to undermine the corner-stones of faith and the spirited rhetoric and carefully construed arguments he had employed. Evidently, he must have held these ideas for some time and so they now relate to him as being a wholly <i>wicked person who rejects God (Psalms 10:13) </i>.",
            "Opening this round of speeches, Eliphaz asserts that the prosperity of a wicked person is not real, for his heart is ever filled with fear and trepidation. Like Job, who had been in constant dread, a wicked person's conscience is never at peace, <i>for he has raised his hand against God and mutinied against the Almighty. (Job 15:25)</i>. ",
            "Bildad asserts that a wicked person does not really prosper, for in the end, like Job, he is cut short from the land of the living, either in terms of his physical continuance, namely, his children and possessions, or in terms of his personal perpetuation: his good name, his reputation and his soul. ",
            "Zophar declares that <i>he will be suddenly and irreparably broken (Proverbs 6:15)</i>, and die without warning and by a strange death. This too had happened to Job, for he had been brought low suddenly and without warning.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A similar sentiment is found in Psalms 73:1-2:<br>Fret not because of evil-doers, nor envy those that act unrighteously.

            "Seeing that all three are addressing the same point, viz. the predicate of the minor premise, Job puts off replying until they have all finished. He then <i>demolishes all their arguments (1 Samuel 3:19)</i> by pointing out that they are drawing conclusions about a general matter from the case of a single individual. However, his original question had addressed the general issue of why the wicked usually prosper and they had not directed their responses to this. For there are wicked people who are both at ease and self-assured (contrary to what Eliphaz had said); and amongst them there are those who are both well-established and successful (just the opposite of Bildad's assertion); and also those who are contented all the days of their mortal life and die without suffering (and not as Zophar predicted). And so <i>all their arguments are irrelevant (Job 21:34)</i> (The introduction to the thirteenth oration).",
            "As to the reliance they had all put on punishment being reserved for the wicked in the world of the souls, Job retorts that since God had created man such that he cannot comprehend the essence of the soul or its meaning, <i>a fortiori</i> he has absolutely no understanding of its reward or punishment.

Morality is not based on the mind's eternity.<br>Virtue is its own reward, and needs no other. This doctrine, which appears, as it were, perfunctorily in so many systems of morals, is by Spinoza insisted on with almost passionate earnestness; few things seem to have moved him to more scornful denial than the popular creed, that supernatural rewards and punishments are necessary as incentives to virtue.

Both seek a single remedy for the two issues being discussed, viz. the suffering of the righteous and the prosperity of the wicked. Both now acknowledge that Job was right when he said that God ought to reward the righteous and punish the wicked immediately; neither should He make the righteous suffer because of some minor sin or in order to compensate him later; nor should He should let a wicked person appear to prosper even for a moment but should wipe him off the face of the earth at once. But each finds a reason why Providence cannot govern in such a manner.",
            "Eliphaz reasons that were this to happen, worship [of God] would be imperfect as there would be no place for free-will nor for reward and punishment. For the righteous would just worship [God] <i>in order to be rewarded (Avot 1:3)</i> and the wicked would only be restrained from doing wrong for fear of the immediate retribution that awaits them. Therefore, God has to conceal the matter and so the righteous sometimes suffer even for some minor sin and the wicked are rewarded for some slight merit. As a result people err, thinking there is neither Judge nor justice, and the righteous who worship [God] do so without any expectation of reward, whilst the wicked plot their evil untroubled. As it is written: <i>It is because sentence for a wicked act is not carried out promptly that men do evil so boldly (Ecclesiastes 8:11).</i> ",
            "Bildad's explanation is that a righteous person may sometimes be born under a malevolent astrological sign and a wicked person under a benevolent one.

But instead, it has been so hidden away that <i>Abaddon and Death say: 'In our ears, we have heard it rumored' (Job 28:21-22)</i>, and he must be consoled by a world after death, and by faith, and fear of God.

            "The last debater [Elihu] is the one who reveals the truth about Job's suffering—the matter related at the opening of the story concerning the sons of God and Satan—namely, that it was a trial. Moreover, that Job had indeed worshipped God out of love and had passed the test of prosperity, serving the Lord without any expectation of riches. Towards the end of his speech, at the close of his argument, Elihu, the last of the protagonists, reveals to Job the true reason for his suffering: that it had been a trial. How, as was related in the Prologue, Satan had presented himself before God; that Job had indeed served God out of love, worshipping Him without any ulterior motive; that he had passed the trial of prosperity and that God had now wanted to try him with poverty, in order to see <i>whether his step would veer from the path</i> (Job 31:7) <i>when so many disasters and calamities befell him</i>.<i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 31:21. 'The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Job: 'Which do you want: poverty or suffering?' Job replied: 'I would rather any affliction in the world but not poverty. When I go to the market and I haven't even a prutah [a small coin] with which to buy anything, what will I eat?' When he began to suffer and to cry out, Elihu said to him: 'Why are you crying out? Didn't you accept any suffering so long as it wasn't poverty?'' (Exodus Rabbah 31:12)</i></i> For he would then have been tested in both ways, and would have been like the sons of God who transcend the flesh.

However, Job is a man, and no man is an angel: 'There is no man in the world so righteous that he always does good and never does bad.' (Ecclesiastes 7:20)</i></i>",
            "Apart from this, Elihu rebukes Job for his assertion that no breach of the Creator's Statute would be involved were God to delegate general governance to the Cosmos, this being a requisite of the 'becoming and demising' world. He demonstrates the error and contradiction in this notion. He also points out his crass stupidity in calling God to order, seeking to teach Him how to punish the wicked; he berates him at length over this. He then goes on to explain that God created man with a built-in instinct for reward and punishment. Hence, if a righteous person suffers and a wicked one prospers, it is because <i>man's own contrariness has led him astray (Proverbs 19:3)</i>; he has not kept that natural law with which he was endowed. For man was created for this: to bring evil-doers to justice and to destroy them; <i>and to raise the prestige of the righteous (Psalms 75:11)</i>. But since this law is not enforced in human society, <i>why does his heart fret against God (Proverbs 19:3)</i>? They [the peoples of the earth] have so sinned in their souls that evil has triumphed over good, overturning the purpose of creation. For they were brought into being to uphold natural justice, <i>to do judgment for the oppressed (Psalms 146:7)</i> <i>and to banish all evil-doers (Deuteronomy 13:6)</i>. ",

For He has planted these concepts in man's soul by means of the innate ideas set in the human soul from the moment of its formation. These are the truths to be found in every soul, bestowed upon it by God. For every man has stamped on his soul that there is a Creator who is absolutely perfect, <i>a faithful God, devoid of injustice (Deuteronomy 32:4)</i>, who rewards and punishes; that he has freedom of choice; and [thirdly] that his soul lives on after separating from the body. These ideas are fundamentals, stamped on each soul; they are its inheritance from God.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These theological truths, no matter how widely they are held, are not what Plato intended by his concept of Ideas or Forms. A different example of Malbim's understanding of this philosophical concept is found in his commentary on Isaiah 40:14, where he states that the 'principle of contradiction', viz., the principle that it is impossible that a quality should both belong and not belong to a given class of things, which Aristotle described as the fundamental axiom of all philosophy, is one of the 'primary intelligences planted by God in man's nature'.</i> Just as man builds his understanding of Nature upon his senses and experience, so he builds his understanding of the metaphysical upon the Ideas implanted in his soul.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kant denied the possibility of a metaphysics and consequently of the validity of any of the traditional proofs—ontological, cosmological or teleological—of the existence of God. The existence of God is not denied, indeed He is a necessary condition in Kant's system, but He is not an object of demonstrative knowledge.<br>Using the science of formal symbolic logic that he had invented, Boole showed that without the assertion that 'whatsoever is absolutely necessary at all is absolutely necessary in every part of space, and in every point of duration', no ontological proof of the existence of God is possible. Boole wrote:<br>Probably this principle will be found to lie at the basis of every attempt to demonstrate, a priori, the existence of an Infinite Being...It is not possible, I think, to rise from a perusal of the arguments of Clarke and Spinoza without a deep conviction of the futility of all endeavors to establish, entirely a priori, the existence of an Infinite Being, His attributes, and His relation to the universe. The fundamental principle of all such speculations, viz., that whatever we can clearly conceive, must exist, fails to accomplish its end, even when its truth is admitted. For how shall the finite comprehend the infinite? Yet must the possibility of such conception be granted, and in something more than the sense of a mere withdrawal of the limits of phenomenal existence, before any solid ground can be established for the knowledge, a priori, of things infinite and eternal (Boole, p.217).</i>",
            "Elihu concludes his address by arguing that man's intellect is also incapable of attaining a complete understanding of the natural sciences. This being so, <i>how can he presume to climb God's mountain</i> (Numbers 14:44) and obtain a correct and full understanding of that which is beyond Nature.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Traditional theology presumed that metaphysics is more important than physics. The implication here is that metaphysics is also more difficult to understand than physics, and so if man cannot understand the latter, a fortiori, he cannot comprehend the former. In traditional theology, the design revealed by science is viewed as evidence of the existence of an Intelligent Creator. This teleological argument is found in numerous medieval sources:<br>Just as the garment testifies to [the existence of] the weaver...so does the universe testify to [the existence of] the Holy One, blessed be He, who created it' (Midrash Temurah, 3). <br>But if the design is evidence of His existence, then the clearer this design becomes the more redundant and irrelevant that Intelligent Creator is made. As Gillespie has written:<br>...the empirical proof that God was also an active force as a moral agent in the universe was derived from the supposed necessity of assuming that divine interventions accounted for the physical phenomena which were inexplicable on purely scientific grounds. The proof of the existence of God, therefore, was based on what science had accomplished, and the proof of His continued activity on what it had not...as more and more events in physical history were explained naturally, there were fewer episodes to be explained supernaturally and fewer empirical illustrations of God's immediate control over the material world' (Genesis and Geology, p. 220).<br>Governance and supernatural explanations may indeed have little or no place in modern western man's understanding of his physical environment, but, however improbable they may seem, they are still the only non-medicinal therapy there is for his fears and uncertainties. Belief in an improbable and untestable notion is the one alternative an individual has to the stimulating or tranquilizing drugs he otherwise needs, in order to see himself through 'the valley of the shadow of death' that he must daily traverse.</i> He should be satisfied that these priceless perceptions of the integrity of God's judgments, of reward and punishment and of the immortality of the soul, are to be found in his soul, impressed upon it from its incipience. And apart from this, Divine messages are at times communicated to him in a vision or dream. <i>For God has not abandoned him in the valley of darkness (Psalms 23:4),</i> <i>without a Divine lamp to enlighten his soul and to illuminate the night (1 Samuel 3:3).</i> ",
            "The debate is closed by God Himself, when He appears<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The appearance of God Himself seems to confirm Elihu's final point that man has not been abandoned by God, at least so far as Job is concerned.</i> <i>out of the Tempest (Job 38:1)</i>.

This concept appears in the Zohar (II,96b):<br>The Lord discerns each holy soul, and taking each in turn to Himself, embraces and fondles her 'dealing with her after the manner of daughters' (Exodus 21:9), even as a father acts towards his beloved daughter, embracing and fondling her and presenting her with gifts.<br>In his glosses on Genesis 2:9, Malbim discusses the relationship between the soul and the body. He concludes that before Adam had eaten the forbidden fruit, when he was still an immortal being, his body and soul were distinct entities, linked symbiotically. His soul had lost none of its independence and was just clothed in his body, a clothing that it could put on or take off at will. The merging of man's body and soul into a single entity only happened after Adam sinned: Before he sinned, Adam's soul had not been integrated with his body, but just resided in it. And so his prophecy was like that of Moses.<br>The Talmudic Sages (TB Yevamot 49b) asserted that whereas Moses beheld the Divine as through a clear mirror, the other prophets did so through 'a mirror which does not shine'. Malbim explains that the souls of all the prophets were to some degree fettered to their bodies. However, whilst still living, Moses had managed to release himself from all bodily needs, thereby liberating his soul (Rosenbloom p.379-383).</i> and continues living after separation from the body, cleaving to its God. For during a vision, the soul possesses the same nature it has after its separation [from the body], at that moment when it returns <i>to the treasury of life (1 Samuel 25:29)</i> with the Lord its God, when it no longer has need of either the discernment of intelligence or the confirmation of comprehension, not even of faith. For what is seen with the prophetic faculty is unequivocal knowledge, unerring, beyond consciousness and intellect<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">'The essence of prophecy is an attachment to, or communication with, God, which is experiential in nature' (D. Bleich, p. 273). Spinoza wrote: 'Prophecy, or revelation, is sure knowledge revealed by God to man' (Theologico-Political Treatise, R.H.M.Elwes translation, p. 13). Prophecy is God revealing 'His secret to His servants the prophets' (Amos 3,7). But becoming a prophet does not mean a loss of human personality; the prophet remains an individual.<br>The Talmud (TB Megillah 14a) states that the number of persons who will have prophetic experiences during the course of Jewish history will be twice the number that left Egypt at the Exodus, i.e. 2   600,000 = 1,200,000 men above the age of twenty and in addition a similar number of women and children. The vast majority will not bear specific divine messages and not all those that do will bear messages of eternal import. This is not to imply that their prophetic experience is of a lower quality than that of the prophets whose messages constitute the prophetic books of the Bible. 'A maidservant saw at the [crossing of the Red] Sea what Ezekiel and all the other prophets never saw' (Mekhilta, Shira, 3).<br>There is no consensus amongst the Talmudic Sages and the medieval Jewish philosophers as to the qualities which make a man suitable to be a prophet, nor whether prophecy is restricted to the Land of Israel. However, it is generally agreed that prophecy ceased shortly after the destruction of the First Temple and the Exile of the Jews from the Land of Israel.<br>In his glosses on Jeremiah 1:5 Malbim writes that in order to achieve the status of a prophet a person must satisfy two requirements: (i) he must be predisposed by the excellence of his nature, intelligence and temperament for prophecy; (ii) he must prepare himself to receive the prophecy by the goodness of his deeds and the holiness of his life-style. However, when no suitable prophets are available but God needs one to deal with an emergency, as for example in the case of Gideon, He chooses the best available candidate and endows him with the necessary qualities to fulfill his mission.</i>. It is in this way that those truths which are beyond the reach of our senses are made known by God; through revelation and prophecy. This is God's grace to mankind, for in this way were the truths and foundations of belief revealed in sure knowledge through the Master of the Prophets, <i>with whom God spoke face to face (Exodus 33:11)</i>, <i>and to whom He showed His Glory (Exodus 33:18.)</i>. ",
            "The book concludes by telling us that Job had in fact never stopped believing all of this. He had never really doubted either Providence, reward and punishment or free-will. Everything he said was an act - that of a researcher looking for a way to establish these articles of faith through the exercise of intellect and inquiry.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">'The intention of Job is not to present us with a full answer to the question; why are there righteous people who suffer and wicked ones who prosper? In principle, Job teaches us that a person who fears God does not waiver from his path, despite it becoming clear to him that a person's fate does not always accord with his deeds, but is determined by God according to other factors unknown to him.' (Haham, p. 12).<br>Dreadful occurrences, such as the torture and death of the ten rabbinical martyrs and the desecration of R. Akiva's body (TB Menachot 29b) are explained by the Talmud as being Divine decrees, beyond questioning and human comprehension. The Sages are drawn to conclude that 'there is death without sin and suffering without iniquity' (TB Shabbat 55b).<br>In his comments on Job 42:7, Malbim explains that Job's three companions, Eliphaz, Bildad and Zophar, had also been acting; when they put forward the various orthodox theological arguments used to defend Providence; they had not really believed them. Job had in fact already pointed this out to them (see The Introduction to Seventh Oration and Ch. 13:9-11). Furthermore, whilst Job had not really believed what he said, they in their hearts had in fact agreed with the heresies he expressed. Consequently, they are rebuked by God: 'You did not speak correctly about me, as did my servant Job' (Job 42:7).<br>The reader might prefer the more straightforward interpretation that 'the honest complaint of Job is preferable to the hypocritical certainties of his friends.'

The body of man is matter and his soul is form. The body alone dies; the soul is immortal.</i>   The essential nature of matter is its property of always being able to assume a new form. And so form can only be destroyed coincidentally, i.e., on account of its intimate association with matter, such as when a physical object assumes a new form. Maimonides continues: <br><i>It is therefore clear that all corruption, destruction or defect comes from matter. Take, for example, man; his deformities and unnatural shape of limbs; all weakness, interruption, or disorder of his actions, whether innate or not, originate in the transient matter, not in the form. All other living beings likewise die or become ill through the matter of the body and not through its form. Man's shortcomings and sins are all due to the matter of the body and not to its form; while all his merits are exclusively due to his form. Thus the knowledge of God, the formation of ideas, the mastery of desire and passion, the distinction between that which is to be chosen and that which is to be rejected, all these man owes to his form; but eating, drinking, sexual intercourse, excessive lust, passion, and all vices, have their origin in the matter of his body</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Guide for the Perplexed Part 3, Chapter 8</i> <br> Accordingly, we are told how the 'sons of God', who are the forces found throughout creation, His sons and His handiwork, were in attendance before the Lord.

They are joined by Satan, who is the force of extinction and the source of evil, decay, sin and everything else that obliterates and damages. As Maimonides explained: <br> <i>It does not say: 'And the Sons of God and Satan came to present themselves before the Lord'; for this sentence would have implied that the existence of both was of the same kind and rank...it only states that he joined them. Satan does not attend God of necessity and a priori, for he has no role in existence, only in extinction and decay.

On the other hand, he has no role in the immutable celestial world.</i> <br> Behold, we have a tradition that each of the natural forces of creation is governed by a superior agency that is also its source. These are the 'sons of God' who were in attendance before the Lord; angels that are controlled by and receive their power from God and who are in turn appointed over each of the forces of existence. As the Talmudic Sages said: <i>There is no plant that does not have an angel appointed over it telling it to grow</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bereshit Rabbah 10:6</i>. The Midrashic source actually speaks of 'a destiny in the firmament that acts upon the plant' rather than 'an angel that is appointed over it.'

The herbs and the trees, the grass and the wild plants, to bloom and increase must have the power of the stars that stand over them and look directly at them, each in its particular mode.</i></i>  Likewise, an ethereal agent has also been appointed over the force of extinction and destruction: Satan, the adversary, the killer and the destroyer. As the Talmudic Sages said: <i>He is Satan, he is the evil inclination, he is the Angel of Death</i> (Baba Batra 16a), He is the accuser, the one permitted to corrupt and destroy. "

This is because Job is now to be tried with diseases and bodily afflictions—evils of the third class. The harm visited upon Job so far has been in the shape of elemental disasters or acts of aggression, both of which are beyond the victim's control. However, the diseases and bodily afflictions about to be inflicted upon him are usually the result of the victim's own self-indulgence. A righteous person is not protected from elemental disasters or acts of aggression by the direct action of his righteousness on Nature, for righteousness is not a 'natural' cause but a 'providential' one. He is protected from such evils by Providence, which acts by virtue of his righteousness. As it says in the Book of Psalms:<br> <i>and ten thousand at your right hand; but it will not come close to you. You will look at it with your eyes, seeing the recompense of the wicked. For you are one for whom 'The Lord is my refuge'; You have made the Most High your habitation. No evil will befall you, nor any calamity come close to your home. For He has charged His angels to guard you wherever you go; to carry you on their hands, lest you strike your foot on a stone</i> (Psalms 91:5-12). <br> However, a righteous person's immunity from the harm caused by over-indulgence is a natural consequence of his righteous lifestyle. In his case, righteousness is a 'natural' cause, for as a result of it he exercises self-restraint. As it says:  <i>The righteous man eats for his soul's satisfaction</i> (Proverbs 13:25). Therefore, by virtue of his nature, Job should be immune from these diseases and bodily afflictions.  When Satan destroyed all of Job's possessions, all that was required of God was that He suspend His Providential protection of them; the rest could be left to Satan, the agency of destruction, who would then be free to act. However, in order for Job to suffer diseases and bodily afflictions, a Providential act would be required. It would not be enough for God to remove His protection from Job and leave him to the mercies of the destructive forces of Satan, for his righteous life-style would still afford him a natural protection from physical decay. This further affliction cannot be brought about just by the removal of Providential protection but will require a Providential act to counter Job's natural immunity. Therefore Satan, the agent of extinction and decay, is here 'in attendance before the Lord', for he is unable alone to bring this last disaster upon Job.

At first sight, this appears to be a noble reply and this is how most commentators interpret it. But closer examination shows that in his mind Job was already turning to heresy. This follows from his use of the word 'besides'.  Job believed that in reality good is always touched with bad. Furthermore, from what he subsequently says in the debate, it is clear that he thought that the bad in the world outweighs the good. Consequently, he does not believe God can grant only good. Whoever wants good must also accept an amount of bad. For example, a person, who consumes large quantities of wine and rich foods because he likes their taste, must not complain that it makes him drunk or gives him indigestion. Just the opposite, in exchange for the pleasure it gives him, one who enjoys the taste of wine and good food must be prepared to endure the inevitable and greater discomfort that follows their consumption. The hangover and upset stomach are the price that must be paid for enjoying the food and drink.   Likewise, if we want to receive good from God, namely existence and life, we must of necessity also accept bad; a bad that is greater than the good. So great in fact, that it can be argued that overall what we get in our short lives is principally and mainly bad with just a little good thrown in. When he comes into existence, man is burdened with a host of troubles, worries and uncertainties that crowd his short span. This is the essence of his patrimony.   Thus, Job reveals that in his mind he was already leaning towards the heresy that God's creation of man was to his detriment, for the bad outweighs the good in the world <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Talmud relates:<br> <i>For two and a half years, the academies of Shammai and Hillel were in dispute. The former asserting that it were better for man not to have been created than to have been created; the latter maintaining that it is better for man to have been created than not to have been created. They finally took a vote and decided that it were better for man not to have been created than to have been created. But now that he has been created, let him investigate his past deeds; or, as others say, let him examine his future actions</i> (TB Eruvin 13b)</i>.   To criticize God's motives and to impute that He created man for his own harm <i>is a root from which springs gall and wormwood</i> (Deuteronomy 29:18),  and this is the foundation of all the bitter things that he subsequently expounds in the debate. But since at this point, even though this idea was already in his mind, he only hints at it by his use of the word 'besides', the book relates that <b>despite everything, Job did not sin with his lips</b>.  For he had not yet actually uttered it. Hence, the Talmudic Sages said that though Job did not sin with his lips, he did sin in his heart (TB Baba Batra 16a). "

                    "In Sefer Ha-Ikarim (Part 4, Chapter 4), Joseph Albo notes that there are two ancient opinions concerning the workings of astrology.",
                    "• <i>One is the view of the Philosopher, who says that the heavenly bodies and the stars exert an influence upon the lower world by means of their various motions, by which they cause the elements to move, and combine them and prepare them in various ways to receive the natural forms, so that some persons are prepared to acquire wisdom and others are not; some are prepared to receive the divine prophetic influence and others are not... As for any other signification the stars may have in relation to other things which have no connection with their elemental qualities, as for example in the determination of poverty or wealth, or whether a given person will marry one wife or more than one, or whether he will be virtuous or vicious - this school denies any such power. It is false, they say, and extremely unlikely that the stars should give indications of things which have nothing to do with them, like poverty, wealth love, hate, etc.</i>",
                    "•  <i>The second view is that of the astrologers and star-gazers. They say that all things that happen to a man, do so by the decree of the stars. And they prove it by actual verification. The astrologer tells a person what will happen to him in all particulars, whether he will live long, whether he will be poor or rich, how many wives he will have and so on. This shows that all things that happen to a man are due to the decree of the stars, which it is impossible to escape...Some of the Rabbis hold this view: 'Luck makes one wise, and luck makes one rich' (TB Shabbat 156a)</i>.",
                    "Clearly, Job held the same opinion as the astrologers, namely, that all human affairs are prescribed and apportioned by the Cosmos.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Nahmanides and Gersonides ascribe the same belief to Job. This however raises the question of why, if he did not believe in God's Governance of the sublunar world, Job had offered sacrifices to God lest his children had sinned. Gersonides replies that Job had believed in the immortality of the soul and it was by reason of this that he had done his best to educate his children to the worship of God, even though he did not believe that any material reward would accompany it. Confused as to the workings of Providence, he had wanted to do the right thing and to cover all possibilities and so had acted as though he believed in reward and punishment. However, when the calamities befell him he lost his faith. Malbim's answer to this question, as we shall see, would be that Job never ceased to believe in Providence. The positions and arguments he assumes in the debate were just an act: polemics.</i> This is the principle he lays down at the beginning of his speech, when he curses the night of his conception and the day of his birth, for <i>they had been his ruin</i> <small>(Judges 11:35)</small> (Ch.3:3-10). If they had seen, at the time, that his horoscope prescribed that he was to be a failure during his life, they should have decided upon his extinction, for why should he come into existence just to <i>see strife and sorrow</i> <small>(Jeremiah 20:18)</small>?  (Ch.3:10-14).",
                    "For man instinctively feels<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Literally, 'the impression stamped on man's mind is'</i>  that non-existence is bad for him. Thus, he rues any degree of non-existence which may leave him in want of any object in existence, such as a lack of wealth and the like. Above all, he is frightened by the thought of his own total extinction. But all this is only <i>the homeborn child</i> <small>(Leviticus 18:9)</small> of his imagination, after he has already come into existence. This would not be so had he never existed in the first place, for then nothingness and the absence of presence would be equivalent. We could not then delineate the extent of the non-existence, namely, whether he became extinct never having been of great rank or never having been of low rank, for there is no difference between nothingness and nothingness (Ch.3:14-17).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his glosses, Malbim adds the following explanation: <br>For persons who actually exist, differences of rank have meaning; one is a king, another a courtier. There are also many levels within existence, the weakest and frailest of which is that of a dead fetus, below which there is only extinction. But such distinctions are meaningless for one who has never existed. There are no degrees within nothingness. It is only man's imagination after he has come into existence which makes him feel that these distinctions are bad. But if he did not exist to begin with, these too would not exist.</i> ",
                    "And with this he broadens his argument and comes to the same conclusion as that attributed by Maimonides <i>(Guide for the Perplexed Part 3, Chapter 12)</i> to the scholar Al-Razi, namely, that there is more bad than good in the world. <br> <i>For if the happiness of man and his pleasure in the times of prosperity be compared with the mishaps that befall him, - such as grief, acute pain, defects, paralysis of the limbs, fears, anxieties and troubles, - it would seem as if the existence of man is a punishment and a great evil for him. This author commenced to verify his opinion by counting all the evils one by one.</i> <br>As the folk-songs and proverbs of many of the peoples of the world say: <br>'It is a wonder when anything good happens.' <br><i>Yea, his misfortunes are many</i> <small>(Deuteronomy 31:17)</small> and enduring too. <br>Job makes much of this in his argument (Ch.3:17-20).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We would all be better off had we not been born because there is always more bad than good in the world. But this would not be the case if God Himself governed.</i>",
                    "And even if some other person denies [that the bad outweighs the good] and says that he is bright-eyed with success, enjoying the passage of time as he laps the sweetness of the honeycomb, <i>desirous of life and length of days, for ever and ever</i> <small>(Psalms 21.5)</small>.  The question [asked by Job] still remains in full force. Why did [the night of his conception and the day of his birth] bring him into existence and give life to one who is only waiting to die? (Ch.3:20).",
                    "Moreover, consider the vagaries of destiny. For it is only <i>by reason of this troublemaker</i> <small>(1 Kings 20:7)</small>  that a person, who had been desperately poor and destitute all his days, and had longed for and begged the release of death but to whom the stars gave life, suddenly comes upon great treasure and vast wealth, only to die soon after, just when he wanted to live and <i>see the good</i> <small>(Job 7:7)</small>. (Ch.3:21).",
                    "This clearly shows that the governance of man is subject to the rule of astrology and its ordinances, for good or for bad.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nature's indifference to ethics or morality is an evil that could not possibly be the result of God's Governance. It is the ultimate proof that Governance has been delegated to the blind rule of the Cosmos. <br>For Nature, heartless, witless Nature <br> Will neither care nor know. (A.E.Housman).</i>  And, furthermore, that man is neither master of his actions nor has freedom over them. Choice and enterprise make no difference whatsoever, for his individual acts are prescribed by order and by reason of the stars, and he is incapable of doing good .nor bad other than at their behest (Ch.3:22-24). <br>Job asserts that the proof of all this is in what had happened to him. He had considered himself to be a truly righteous man. Accordingly, he could not accept that what had happened to him was God's retribution for wicked deeds he had done. Nor, in the light of the unnatural way in which he had lost his possessions, could he consider that it was all accidental. In the space of just one hour he had been struck by a variety of agents—tempest, fire and hostile action—suddenly and all at once. Clearly, he was under attack from heaven itself. This must have happened because the stars had decreed that at that particular moment his fortune should reverse. (Ch.3:26) <br>Further proof of this was the premonition he had always felt that the future would be bad. It was as if his mind foresaw that the fate decreed for him by his stars was bad and that he was destined for doom. (Ch.3:25).",
                    "Behold! Underlying all the postulates Job put forward was the conviction that God must know everything that happens in the world below. For no lack of knowledge can be ascribed to Him, nor can He be designated a source of injustice. The unfairness in reward or punishment does not ensue from God. It is caused by the stars. For man has no freedom over his actions; he is compelled in what he does. <br>All of this will be further clarified by the proofs Job will be presenting in his coming arguments, one by one."

                    "Eliphaz held the <i>Torah</i> view,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>That expressed in the </i>Torah<i> passage:<br>Today I offer you the choice of life and good, or death and evil...Choose life and then you and your descendants will live </i>(<i>Deuteronomy</i> 30:15)<i>. </i></i> namely, that man has freedom of choice and the stars have no influence over all those things that are subject to this choice. For man has authority and power over his deeds; to execute them or to desist from doing so, for good or for bad, whilst the stars go their own way in their celestial orbits, flying past without any effect on the world below. As he says: <br> <b>For man is born to labor</b> <br> <b>whilst on high the flaming comets fly past</b> <small>(Ch.5:7)</small>. <br>The courses taken by individuals are not determined by astrology. On the contrary, man is free to do good or evil to himself, as he decides, by the exercise of his own will. For we have seen how anger and lust kill stupid persons who choose so to behave (Ch.5:2). <br>Man was born to strive; initiative is of the essence and effort is both effective and necessary for success (Ch.5:7). ",
                    "And if a person suddenly become prosperous, without having invested any effort or labor, it appearing as though he has achieved his life's ambition without going through any of the intermediate stages, know that this is a bogus prosperity and will not last, neither in his hands nor in those of his children. However, the prosperity of one who enjoys the results of his labors is different, for it will <i>make its seeds spring forth</i> (Isaiah 61:11) and will produce fruit (Ch.5:3-7).",
                    "Furthermore, Job had been mistaken about the premonition he had always felt. As he had said: <br><b>I had a terrible premonition, and it has befallen me</b> (Job 3:25). <br>He had attributed this to an intuition that had entered his soul from the decree of the stars. But, in fact, this fear was on account of his sins, for it is by reason of them that <i>one rises or falls</i> (Psalms 107:26). As Eliphaz says: <b>Was not your immunity the purpose for your piety, ? and your expectations the motive for your integrity.</b> And, as will be explained, Eliphaz also meant by this that Job should have been unsettled by his immunity. His integrity alone should have been his assurance.",
                    "   In this speech Eliphaz also expounds one of the principles mentioned in the <i>Sefer Ha-Ikkarim </i>(Part 4. Chapter 5), namely, that human actions cannot all be absolutely prescribed as the astrologers believe. <br><i>...because this opinion does away with the category of the contingent, and upsets all the principles of the Torah...Also that all human acts are absolutely free, and that effort is of value in all cases,...as is the opinion of the Philosopher,</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The translator Husik notes: 'I am not aware that Aristotle held this view.'</i><i> is also impossible. For we see with our senses that many actions in which a person endeavors to attain something, making all the possible preparations for the attainment of the end, and yet he not merely fails to attain his end, but the very preparations which he has made produce the opposite effect</i>. Take, for example, what had happened with Joseph's brothers. Their intention when they sold him into slavery was to prevent him ruling over them. But it was that very act that ultimately led to his rule. There are also instances where good happens to a person without him trying, as when Saul became king without making any effort whatsoever. <br>Evidently, human actions are of a number of types:",
                    "1. There are the contingent acts which are absolutely freely chosen. These are the ones affected by initiative and intent; in these the property of contingency is conserved. It is on account of these that a person is praised or criticized. And it is to these that both warnings and commands, and reward and punishment, apply.",
                    "2. There are those actions that are absolutely prescribed, such as those things which are decreed by God and will happen no matter what. For example, Joseph's rise to rule etc.",
                    "3. Those actions which are a mixture, involving both choice and prescription, such as the sowing of seeds and the subsequent growth of the crop; or digging for and finding treasure. For the crop will not grow without both the effort of sowing the seed and the intervention of Providence making it rain at the right time. ",
                    "But even those actions that are prescribed, either totally or partially, are not determined by astrology but by Providence and the Will of God (Ch.5:8).",
                    "  Eliphaz brings evidence for the existence of Providential acts from the occurrence of rainfall (Ch.5:9-12), and from the way it saves the needy from the clutches of those stronger than them. By the nature of things, tyrants should always oppress the weak and bring about their extinction from upon the face of the earth.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Nature small fish are eaten by bigger fish who, in turn, are eaten by still bigger ones. That this is not always the case where man is concerned is the result of Providential intercession.</i> (Ch.5:12-17). <br>He also explains that Providence may sometimes make something bad happen to a person in order to save him from a still greater harm that was about to befall him. For instance, when someone who planned to travel by a certain route is prevented from taking it because he twists his ankle on a stone, and the route he had intended to take is raided by bandits. Or, when a person who was planning to board a ship and at the last moment is taken ill and could not sail, and the ship he had intended to take sinks. Thus, by the lesser evil, God saves him from a greater one that was awaiting him (Ch.5:17-23).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>vide</i> Gersonides, <i>The Wars of the Lord</i>. Part 4 Chapter 5 and Albo, <i>Ikkarim</i> Part 4 Chapter 5.</i> <br>   This Providential shield stretches over the righteous and over every detail of their activities (Ch.5:8), protecting them from all types of misfortune (Ch.5:23). According to Eliphaz, neither a man's children, nor the length of his life nor his income depend on luck; they are all determined by merit and Providence alone (Ch.5:24-27).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>vide</i> <i>TB Moed Katan</i> 28a</i>",
                    "• On the global scale, the evidence for the existence of this Providence is found in the nature of rainfall and of the river-based irrigation in countries where no rain falls, such as Egypt (Ch.5:9-10).",
                    "• On the individual scale, the evidence comes from the way it upsets the schemes of the cunning, or how the schemes they have contrived for achieving their goals often become the cause of just the opposite happening (Ch.5:12,17).",
                    "Thus, the reasoned reply that Eliphaz makes to Job's complaint and to his argument that the fact that righteous people suffer the deserts of the wicked is an absolute proof of the non-existence of Providence, is that at times it is for their own good (Ch.5:17,23). ",
                    "However, he does not consider this reply to be completely satisfactory, for he had only derived it from his intellect. Consequently, he does not have complete confidence in it, as he says: <br><b>This is what we present, having examined it and found it valid</b>. <b>Consider it and form your own opinion</b> (Job 5:27). <br>Eliphaz presents his main thesis on the issue of the suffering of the righteous in Chapter 4, where he relates that he had had a prophetic revelation concerning this; <i>visions of the night</i>, (Job 20:8 ) in which he was informed that bad befalls the righteous because of some sin that they have committed. As our Rabbis said: <br><i>There is no suffering without sin</i> (TB Shabbat 55a). <br>And even though, at first sight, no sin could be found in Job, no person can boast and say: <br><i>I have cleansed my soul and I have become purified of my sins</i> (Psalms 55:4). <br>Whichever way it is considered, whether by reference to the greatness of the Creator and the extent of His beneficence towards man, by virtue of which worship beyond measure is due to Him; or by reference to the lowliness of man compared to Him, no person, <i>born of woman</i>, (Job 15:14) can be vindicated against the Most High God or can claim that he has discharged his worship of God, his Maker, in perfect totality. Therefore, God afflicts him, not for his detriment but for his benefit; a penitence for his sin. To cure the sickness of his soul before <i>his measure becomes full</i> (Ecclesiastes Rabbah 1) and he becomes deserving of yet greater punishment, still more severe and enduring, namely, the perdition of his soul or the condemnation of his body to die before its time (Ch.4:12,21).",
                    "These afflictions are but mild medicines if <i>they succeed in safeguarding</i> (Nehemiah 4:1) him against perishing for all eternity. <br>   Now since according to Eliphaz's thesis, it is conceivable that a righteous suffer but not that he perish (Ch.4:7-11); and since, even according to Job, all that can be concluded from his afflictions is that a righteous person may suffer but not that he perishes; the foundation upon which Job had built his hypothesis that the world has been handed over to astrology, namely, his contention that he had been made to suffer even though he not in his judgment sinned, is destroyed. These afflictions had befallen him because of a sin he had committed, namely, not perfecting his worship [of God] to a degree that befits the worship of the Lord; a worship that has no limit or design. The afflictions had not been intended to wipe him out; <i>he will yet be rebuilt…and restored (Proverbs 24:3)</i> (Ch.4:20, 4:27).",
                    "As further evidence that Job had not been completely perfect in his worship, Eliphaz cites the fact that he had begun to complain against God and to deny principles of faith the moment the suffering started. This showed that his fear of God had not been genuine and had only been motivated by love of reward and fear of punishment. For someone who genuinely fears the Lord, <i>his steps do not falter</i> (Psalms 37:31) when He rebukes him; unlike Job who <i>preaches nonsense</i>, (Job 35:16) turning everything upside down (Ch.4:2, 4:7)."

                    "Returning to the fray, Job reemphasizes his conviction that, as he had postulated, the Earth has been placed in the hands of the Cosmos and that no account or reckoning is kept of a person's deeds, whether they be good or bad. For everything a person does is prescribed and he cannot change what has been predetermined by his luck and horoscope. Hence, there is no difference between the righteous and the wicked. The proof of this is that we observe <i>righteous men perishing in their righteousness</i> (Ecclesiastes 7:15),  as was shown by the example of he himself and what had happened to him. For he had become <i>like a shattered vessel</i> (Psalms 31:13) even though he had been both righteous and virtuous.",
                    "Eliphaz had countered this by asserting that the evil which befalls a righteous person is only temporary and no righteous person ever perishes completely. A righteous person suffers only by reason of some small sin he has committed; in order that he be purged of this minor transgression with mild passing afflictions and be thereby saved from eternal perdition. According to Eliphaz, Job's suffering was of this type. Against this, Job argues that what had happened to him clearly shows that a righteous person can totally perish, for there is no possible way that he could ever revert to his previous state and recover from his illness.  He had been struck such a blow of death and extinction that he would not survive his illness, as he brings evidence to show (Ch. 6:4-13). This being so, of what comfort is it to him that, through this suffering, his minor sins will be purged and he will be saved from everlasting adversity or from death and perdition. And that he will yet be restored <i>and live, broken as he is</i> (2Samuel 1:10 ),  seeing that the only hope he has left is to crave that his death be brought forward so that he might be released from his great agony (ibid and Ch. 7:11-17). ",
                    "And if it be argued that he had in fact committed sins of such enormity that he had been justly sentenced to death, then he demands to know what these were (Ch. 6:28-30).",
                    "And as regards the argument that he had confirmed his own guilt by his inability to stand the test and by his hasty complaint, as Eliphaz had said: <b>For as soon as anything happened to you, you broke;you were barely touched and you panicked</b> (Job 4:5). He [Job] replies that the measure of his complaint was negligible compared to the scale of his suffering and the great wrong done to him (Ch. 6:2-5).",
                    "Aside from this, he employs philosophy to refute the whole of Eliphaz's thesis, in particular his assertion that a righteous person may suffer in order to purge his iniquity and to save him from death by reason of his sins. Against this reasoning, he puts forward a cogent alternative postulate, one based upon the recognition that every animal and object must have been created for some purpose. But, look here, some existing entities exhibit neither action nor work, so it must be that it is their very existence, for as long as it lasts, that is in itself their purpose. However, in most instances, we observe that entities strive, act and are acted upon—each one from his work that they were doing —as though they thereby pursue the purpose for which they were created. Since man is one of the components of creation—the choicest amongst them—he too must seek some perfection to which he can aspire for as long as he remains standing. But what are the instrumental means that bring him to his perfection? There are a number of opinions concerning this. ",
                    "•  There are those who say that what matters is the actual deed; that it [the deed] is the means to his perfection. That if he completes this deed he will have achieved his perfection. ",
                    "•  Others say that it is not the deed itself that matters but the person. That the person must strive all his life and that his perfection depends upon that, irrespective of whether he manages to complete the deed or not.",
                    "This controversy is found in the words of the Talmudic Sages (<i>TB Sanhedrin 111a</i>): <br><i>[Commenting on the verse in Isaiah 5:14] 'Therefore Sheol has enlarged her appetite and has opened her jaws for he who is without statute',  Resh Lakish says: [The meaning of the phrase 'for he who is without statute' is] for he who has left even a single statute unperformed. [Disputing this interpretation] Rabbi Yochanan says: It does not befit their Master for you to say this to them, [for it would mean that He has condemned almost all of Israel to Sheol]. Instead, [take it to mean] for he who has not learned even a single statute; [had he done so he would have been saved from Sheol].</i> <br>According to Resh Lakish, perfection requires the observance of all the precepts of the Torah without exception. However, according to Rabbi Yochanan, the observance of even one precept is enough, for a person's perfection depends on his doing as much as he can during his life.",
                    "For the purposes of our investigation we can say that some take the view that a man should busy himself throughout his life with the Torah and its Commandments and that he thereby achieves his perfection. That whether his life is long and he has the opportunity of keeping all 613 Commandments, or whether he dies young or for some other reason could keep only a few of them, he will still have achieved his perfection. For his perfection does not depend on the quantity of his worship but only on its regularity throughout the days of his life, whether they be many or few. Others hold the alternative view, namely, that he must fulfill his obligation to observe all of the Commandments, for it is thereby that he achieves his perfection. And if, even for reasons beyond his control, he fails to keep them all, he will not have perfected himself. ",

And if, even for reasons beyond his control, he fails to keep them all, he will not have perfected himself.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the interpretation given to the passage in the TB Sanhedrin 111a by Joseph Albo in Sefer Ha-Ikarim.</i>",
                    "Whichever view is taken, Eliphaz's argument that God makes a righteous person suffer in order to purge him of some minor sin he has committed, such as not perfecting his worship of God to a degree befitting the greatness of He who is being worshipped, God Himself, Blessed be He, is untenable. For such suffering prevents him from worshipping God at all: the cure is worse than the disease! Like the servant or employee of a king who was somewhat slipshod about his work and whom the king sent to prison, for his own good, to atone for his offense. But as a result, during the whole time he spends in prison he is stopped from working altogether. So what was supposed to be for his good, turns out to be very bad. Likewise, how would God be doing good to a righteous person who had not exerted himself in his worship to a degree befitting He who was being worshipped, seeing that by afflicting him He just forces him to be even more idle and to worship Him even less? (Ch. 7:1-11).",
                    "As regards Eliphaz's statement that by reason of the suffering he is presently enduring he will be saved from a premature death and everlasting perdition, Job replies that he is already as good as dead. For by reason of these afflictions he is prevented from carrying out his work, the holy work for which he was created. Thus, as long as he is sick and suffering, it is as though he were not alive. Moreover, what difference does it make to him if he dies at the end of his days or if he is effectively dead for some period during those days? For the period of time not spent in the pursuit of his perfection is for ever gone, as though it had never been. In terms of the time irretrievably lost, this too is perdition. (The Talmudic Sages observed concerning this: 'What are loving afflictions? Those which do not prevent the learning of Torah...and prayer.'<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">TB Berachot 5a. Explaining the meaning of the term 'loving afflictions' Rashi writes: <i>The Holy One Blessed be He afflicts him in this world [though he is] without any iniquity, in order to increase his reward in the Hereafter more than his merit warrants.</i> <br>In the Guide for the Perplexed (III,17) Maimonides notes that the doctrine of afflictions of love, in the sense of a person being afflicted without having previously committed any sin in order that his future reward be increased, is not supported by any Scriptural text. It is a teaching of the Mu'tazilites. It is not what the trials described in the Bible, such as those of Abraham, are about.</i>  For when one is prevented by the afflictions from worshiping, they are a terrible evil for him and he is considered as though he were dead.) It is preferable for him to die at the end of his days and not in the middle of them (Ch. 7:6-8).",
                    "And as regards his [Eliphaz's] hint of a world of resurrection, as he said, <i>so as to prevent them perishing for ever</i> (Job 4:20), Job rejects this. For just as he denies Providence and free-will and attributes everything to the governance of nature and astrology, so he denies resurrection and future reward. As the Talmudic Sages said (Baba Batra 16b): 'Job denied the resurrection of the dead' (Ch. 7:8-9).",
                    "Regarding Eliphaz's assertion that this response was revealed to him by prophecy in a night vision,  Job replies that if, as he says, God's word concerning this matter was really revealed to him, it would have been more befitting had the utterance and the vision come directly to him, to reveal these truths to him and to calm his raging spirit. And in what way did the spirit of the Lord pass from him to Eliphaz, who is no more worthy of God's word than he is? (Ch. 6:13-14).",
                    "Apart from this, he brings the following argument against Providence. How can it be supposed that God, Blessed be He, supreme above all, could have intended that His personal Providence apply to man, who is so very base. And of all things, that this Providence should be so particular and so meticulous that even the number of afflictions, when they begin and when they end, should emanate from God. And how can we say that a person's sin is the cause of this singular care, which must ensure that he does not die from his illness but only suffer at a specified rate and remain alive, as though He had some need for the person's existence? But what loss is there in his sins or gain in his perfection or correction, for all this is meaningless to a philosopher? (Ch. 7:17-21).",
                    "This is the substance of Job's reply, apart from the bitterness he voices towards his companions in the course of his words for having betrayed him, and the portrayal of his great suffering, as is the manner of a distressed person who <i>is infested, smitten by God and tortured</i> (Isaiah 53:4).

By their very severity, these afflictions belie Eliphaz's thesis that though a righteous man might be made to suffer, he would never be made to perish completely."

                    "Like Eliphaz, he too believes in Providence and freedom of choice, and like him he <i>presents a stubborn shoulder (Zechariah 9:29) </i>to the opinion of the astrologers. But since, in his reply to Eliphaz, Job had made no mention of these speculative matters, Bildad too ignores them and presents just a single reasoned argument against those who deny Providence, when he asks: <b>Would God pervert judgment? Or would the Almighty pervert justice?</b> (Job 8:3). What he meant by this is as follows: One of the necessary attributes of the Deity is that no perfection should be wanting in Him nor any shortcoming present in Him. Now, it would certainly be a shortcoming were any injustice or <i>perversion of judgment (Habakkuk 1:4) </i>to emanate from Him, and so such wrongs could not originate in Him.",
                    "Job had taken this to be axiomatic and had based his theses upon it; the new disputant [Bildad] acknowledged it too. However, Job had considered these matters from the viewpoint of 'individual' law,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Those laws of Nature that pertain to individual entities, as distinct from those that pertain to the universe as a whole (universal or general law).</i> and so had reasoned as follows: <br> •  For God to do any injustice is prohibited by His essential quality. <br> •\tHowever, the governance of individuals is patently not ordered according to law and justice, for we observe that it does not distinguish between the righteous and the wicked, <i>all things come alike to all</i>; <i>as is the good person so is the sinner (Ecclesiastes 9:2) </i>subject to the accidents of time and its vagaries. <br>•  And since it is an injustice for the righteous to suffer undeservedly, this governance cannot emanate from God, for <i>far be it from God to do wrong, or for the Almighty to be unjust</i> (Job 34:10). <br>Therefore Job had concluded that this governance emanates from a blind and undiscerning ruler—the Cosmos—which makes no distinction between the one who serves God and the one who does not.",
                    "However, from considerations of primary universal law, Bildad draws just the opposite conclusion, for according to his reasoning: <br>• Just as injustice must be precluded from God for it is a shortcoming, so must omnipotence be attributed to Him for it is a perfection. <br>•  Now, by saying that God has delegated the governance of the world to a blind ruler who does not discriminate between good and bad, we could indeed mitigate what happens to individuals by reason of this misrule, arguing that these things do not emanate from God but from those agents of the Cosmos which control individual governance. <br>• However, in terms of primary universal law we could not justify what He has done. For we would ask whether this delegation of governance to the Cosmos was not of itself an injustice on His part. <br>There are only two possible ways out of this. The first is to posit that He is incapable of exercising judgment or of administering individual governance and that is way He has delegated them to the Cosmos. But this cannot be, for the Deity must be Omnipotent. Bildad expresses this rhetorically by asking, '<b>Would God</b>—who is Omnipotent and Supreme—<b>'pervert judgment?</b>'.",
                    " The second way is to assert that He has abandoned the lower beings and no longer wishes to take care of them, either out of disgust or jealousy (<i>Guide for the Perplexed</i>, Part 3: Chapter 16). But this would be unjust and prompts Bildad to ask: '<b>Would the Almighty pervert justice?</b>'",
                    "Bildad argues that all this constitutes a conclusive proof that the governance of individuals emanates from Providence and that the misrule we infer from the suffering of the righteous is a misunderstanding on our part. For in truth, everything is ordered by Him in justice and with judgment; for <i>He is a faithful God and there is no injustice</i> (Deuteronomy 32:4). ",
                    "This being so, why indeed does God allow bad things to happen to good people? In answering this, Bildad adopts a different approach. According to his philosophy, God afflicts a righteous person without his having first sinned, only so that He can subsequently benefit him, by repaying him with good in exchange for the bad, many times over. The afflictions are part of a system of compensation and exchange, a <i>quid pro quo</i> whereby present adversity brings future bounty (Ch.8:6-7).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the view that Maimonides attributes to Bildad, noting that 'this opinion concerning Providence is widespread'. However, elsewhere (Guide III,24), he adds the rider that 'this principle is not mentioned in Scripture in plain language'. Even where the literal meaning appears to convey this, as in the verse 'Who fed you in the wilderness with manna…to test you, and in the end to make you prosper' (Deuteronomy 8:16), Maimonides explains the text differently.</i>",
                    "In the sayings of the wise, man is often likened to a plant. Taking up this metaphor, Bildad explains that the system of exchange he has proposed can be compared to the way Nature acts with regard to different plants. If a gardener uproots a plant that is growing in a rocky, dry and desolate site and replants it in a fresh and fertile plot, the uprooting obviously does it no harm. On the contrary, it is for its good so that <i>it will grow as a noble vine</i> (Jeremiah 2:21). However not every plant can take this sort of treatment. Plants which need lots of water to grow, and which are by their nature tender and soft, will not take root again after being transplanted but instead <b>will wither quicker than any other plant</b> (Job 8:12). ",
                    "Providence works in the same way with mankind. A wicked person who is accustomed to pleasures and luxuries would not survive transplantation and so is just taken from the world before his time. Thus, no good comes to the wicked nor does he live very long. However, though a righteous person may be uprooted and transplanted many times over, being dispossessed and suffering physical pain, this is ultimately for his own good, in order to set him <i>in a firm place (Isaiah 22:23). </i><i>For he will yet bring forth fruit in old age; (Psalms 92:15) </i><i>For he will yet bring forth fruit in old age; (Psalms 92:15) </i><i>and the Lord's purpose prospering in his hand (Isaiah 53:10). </i>(Ch.8:11-20).",
                    "Accordingly, Bildad recommends to Job that <i>he should hold fast, (Daniel 11:1) place his trust in God (Psalms 21:8) </i>and <i>plead with Him</i> (2 Kings 1:13). For then in place of his suffering <i>his portion will rejoice (Isaiah 61:7) </i><i>and in the end he will flourish tremendously (Job 8:7). </i>(Ch.8:17, 8:21-22).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Malbim's introduction to Bildad's speech is more reminiscent of the ideas of some of the later Stoics, e.g. Seneca On Providence, than of the Talmudic tradition or Kabbalah with whom Malbim identifies Bildad.</i> "

                    "<i>Like a rod of tempered steel</i>, (Jeremiah 1:19) this poor wretch braces himself to uphold his assertion that the personal governance which <i>pours scorn on the princes (Psalms 197:40) </i> <i>and makes a mockery at the ordeal of the innocents, (Job 9:23) </i><i>God's eyes are not upon it</i> (Deuteronomy 11:12); <i>His Throne is innocent (2 Samuel 14:9) </i>of such calumnies. Such injustice cannot emanate from Him. The agents of the Cosmos, into whose hands the earth has been given, it is <i>they alone that are at the heart this injustice</i> (Ezra 9:2). Job's reply to Bildad is divided into three parts:",
                    "<b>Part One:</b> Job starts by responding to the proof Bildad had presented at the beginning of his speech, that which had purported to demonstrate God's Providence from considerations of universal law. Bildad had argued that it would be an injustice or a deficiency in the makeup of He who is Omnipotent and Righteous were He to delegate government to evil stewards. However, no injustice may be present in God and, likewise, He must possess absolute capability. And so Bildad had asked, <b>Would God pervert judgment</b>?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Both Job and Bildad agree that God must be perfect. However, each draws different conclusions from this. Basing himself on ethical judgments, Job argues that to attribute the observed disorder in the governance of individuals to God is to imply that He is imperfect; this cannot be and so He must have been delegated this governance to another. On the other hand, basing himself on constitutional considerations, Bildad argues that for God to have delegated this governance to another is tantamount to denying His Perfection and Omnipotence. Job now sets out to show that delegating Providence to the Cosmos—Nature—does not involve any breach of the Divine Constitution.</i>",
                    "Job's rebuttal is philosophical and is similar to that posited by Maimonides in a related matter, namely, when he argued against those who claim that there is more bad than good in the world. As he wrote: <br><i>The origin of the error is to be found in the circumstance that this ignorant man, and his party among the common people, judge the whole universe by examining one single person. For an ignorant man believes that the whole universe only exists for him; as if nothing else required any consideration. If, therefore, anything happens to him contrary to his expectation, he at once concludes that the whole universe is evil. If, however, he would take into consideration the whole universe, form an idea of it, and comprehend what a small portion he is of the Universe, he will find the truth. For it is clear that persons who have fallen into this widespread error as regards the multitude of evils in the world, do not find the evils among the angels, the spheres and stars, the elements, and that which is formed of them, viz., minerals and plants, or in the various species of living beings, but only in some individual instances of mankind... It is of great advantage that man should know his station, and not erroneously imagine that the whole universe exists only for him. We hold that the universe exists because the Creator wills it so; that mankind is low in rank as compared with the uppermost portion of the universe...</i> ",
                    "<i>The first kind of evil is that which is caused to man by the circumstance that he is subject to genesis and destruction, or that he possesses a body. It is on account of the body that some persons happen to have great deformities or paralysis of some of the organs. This evil may be part of the natural constitution of these persons, or may have developed subsequently in consequence of changes in the elements, e.g. through bad air, or thunderstorms or landslides. We have already shown that, in accordance with the divine wisdom, genesis can only take place through destruction, and without the destruction of the individual members of the species the species themselves would not exist permanently...He who thinks that he can have flesh and bones without being subject to any of the accidents of matter, unconsciously wishes to reconcile two opposites, viz., to be at the same time subject and not subject to change. If man were never subject to change there could be no generation; there would be one single being, but no individuals forming a species. Galen says correctly that it would be in vain to expect to see living beings formed from the blood of menstruous women and the semen virile, who will not die, will never feel pain, or will move perpetually, or shine like the sun. This dictum of Galen is part of the more general proposition:- Whatever is formed of any matter receives the most perfect form possible in that species of matter; in each individual case the defects are in accordance with the defects of that individual matter. The best and most perfect being that can be formed of the blood and the semen is the species of man... It is therefore impossible that man should be free from this species of evil. You will, nevertheless, find that the evils of the above kind which befall man are few and very rare.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Guide for the Perplexed. Part 3. Chapter 12. This same passage is quoted by Leibniz in his rejection of Pierre Bayle's argument that there is more bad than good in the world. Rosenbloom (p.168) suggests this might indicate that Malbim was familiar with Leibniz's Theodicy. Elsewhere, (glosses on Genesis 1:31) Malbim explains the origin of this dispute in epistemological terms:</i> <br><i>Those who say that it [the world] is the best, do so on the basis of reason, for it is unimaginable that God would create other than the best...and God does not lack the wisdom to know what is the best nor the ability to make it...and so the world that He created is surely the very best that can be made...But those who say that the world is not the best possible, come to this conclusion by reason of sense perception and experience, seeing the defects in the world and the shortcomings and many evils to be found in it.</i></i>",
                    "Now let us see how Job employed this same postulate in a wider context, in an examination of the whole of existence, as follows: It has become apparent to modern scientists,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Written in or about 1865.</i> that the stars fall under the category of 'becoming and demising';<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The category that accounts for the transient quality of the terrestrial (sublunar) world.</i> that they are not made of a quintessence as had been the opinion of the ancients, but of ordinary matter like that of the Earth's; and that they too will ultimately decay. This is clear from the words of the prophets too:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is an example of Malbim's thesis that the Tnach had nothing to fear from the new, for it had anticipated the new</i> <i>For the heavens will vanish like smoke,</i> <i>and the earth age like a garment (Isaiah 51:6). </i> <br>It has also been shown that the sun, <i>queen of the heavens</i>, (Jeremiah 7:18) together with the multitude of stars in orbit around it, is <i>as nothing and as naught (Isaiah 41:12) </i>compared to the many thousands and tens of thousands of suns that are scattered throughout immeasurable space and which we see as just small specks twinkling in the Milky Way. They are worlds without number, which are also complex structures and are also destined for decay and demise.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his commentary on Proverbs 3:19, Malbim writes: When He created the world ex nihilo, the Maker had in mind a number of possibilities about the different ways in which the world might be formed and, in His immaculate wisdom, He chose to form it in this way.</i>",
                    "So we can say that even were the sun, the moon and all the multitude of stars to become extinct at some future time, together with all their inhabitants, this would be neither an injustice nor an act of absolute evil on the part of the Creator of the whole of existence. For since, in His wisdom, He chose to create a 'becoming and demising' universe that encompasses a multitude of worlds,<i> </i>beyond number, compared with which the solar system is no more than <i>a drop in a bucket</i>, (Isaiah 40:15) then were the sun and the stars to become extinct, it would be just an inevitable consequence of their overall 'becoming and demising' nature; a consequence of the general property of the stuff of the physical world, of which the astral world is a part. There would be nothing wrong in this in terms of overall existence, relative to which the sun is of no more consequence than is a single individual within the whole of mankind.  And if it was only one particular planet, for instance, planet Earth, that was annihilated and not a large component of existence, such as the whole of the solar system, there would certainly be nothing wrong with this in terms of overall existence, compared to which the Earth is no more than a drop in the sea. And how much more, if the desolation was to affect only a part of planet Earth, such as might happen if a large mountain subsided as a result of an earthquake and many tens of thousands of people were to die. Once again, there would be nothing wrong with this in terms of overall existence, for it is an inevitability of the 'becoming and demising' property. Moreover, the Earth could not have been made as it is, from the four elements, without landslides and earthquakes sometimes occurring as a result of the fiery vapors, the watery particles or the winds which are enclosed within it and which are essential for its existence and continuance. The bad that sometimes results from this is insignificant compared to the overall good; for the very existence of the Earth would be impossible without this property (for otherwise the Earth could only be either a spirit or made of quintessence).",
                    " And finally, the misfortunes that befall a single person – one of the units of mankind – such as the disasters that had befallen Job by reason of the nature of overall 'demising', should certainly not be considered an evil at all. Accordingly, the philosopher [Aristotle] would say that Bildad has no basis for his complaint against primary law. For in his opinion, there is no inherent injustice in primary law that can be attributed to He who invented universal existence, since existence is good overall and He has graced it <i>with His wisdom and bounty (1Kings 10:7 ). </i>So we cannot consider Him unjust if, of necessity, harm and decay befall a single individual of a species or even if they befall a whole species that is no more than a single unit relative to the genus, and <i>a fortiori</i> relative to overall existence. For this 'evil' is necessary in terms of the order of general existence, which could not otherwise have come into being. ",
                    "Thus, his Job's reply to the argument implied by Bildad's rhetorical question '<b>Would God pervert justice?</b>' is that primary universal law is entirely good and gracious; <i>there being no injustice in it</i> (Deuteronomy 32:4 ). But if we hold that personal law emanates from Providence, we have no way of rationalizing this position. For if that is the case, the question remains of why does God not providentially prevent bad from befalling the innocent. From which it follows that He must have delegated individual providence to universal Nature, and that, notwithstanding, no injustice can be attributed to God by reason of the unwarranted evil that befalls a single man. For He deals only with overall existence, ensuring that it is as good as possible, and the bad that does befall individuals is insignificant compared to the overall good preserved in the whole of existence (Ch.9:2-l3).",
                    "<b>Part Two:</b> In the second part of his speech, Job disputes the new proposition that Bildad had introduced, namely, that afflictions befall the righteous by way of a <i>quid pro quo</i>: that on account of the bad a person presently endures he will receive good in the future. Since, in his presentation, Bildad did not go into the details of how this reciprocity works, Job now formally examines all the possible ways by which this could take place. <br>He posits that the exchange process can be visualized as occurring in one of five different ways, as follows: If an individual is to receive future good in exchange for present bad, then one of two conditions must apply:",
                    "1. That the relationship between the future good and the present bad is inherent;",
                    "2. That their relationship to one another is only incidental.",
                    "Each of these alternatives can in turn be further qualified in two ways:",
                    "• That the inherent relationship can be thought of as being natural: that just as all animals and other natural entities can only achieve their perfection through effort, work and anguish, so a perfect person can only acquire good through suffering.",
                    "• That the inherent relationship is metered and only takes place through God's will: that the person's anguish <i>is weighed in His just balance (Job 31:6), </i> bounty and delight being his recompense.",
                    "The incidental relationship can also be qualified in two ways:",
                    "That the good befalls him on account of the bad by virtue of prayer and mercy, for by reason of the suffering, the person prays to God and He finds favor in him, <i>and He returns this man's virtue (Job 33:26). </i>",
                    "Fourthly, it may be by way of a trial: that if the person withstands the trial and does not complain about the suffering, He will reward him with good and with grace.",
                    "A fifth possibility:",
                    "—  is that the exchange mechanism is just a prophylactic; that when God foresees that a righteous person is by his nature likely to sin at some time in the future, He makes him suffer in advance, thereby <i>bending his will (Leviticus 26:41) and preventing him from slipping</i>; (Psalms 37:31) <i>and then the Lord will again rejoice over him for good (Deuteronomy 30:9).</i> ",
                    "And so, this sophist [Job] sets out to refute all the ways by which this exchange can be thought to occur: ",
                    "• He refutes the first possibility, namely, that the interrelationship is a natural one, by arguing that there is no natural link between the suffering and the good it is supposed to effect. When an animal strives to catch its prey, it gets its quarry or its gratification in exchange for the effort it put in by way of cause and effect; for it is by its effort that it gets its food. But how can future good be achieved through present suffering, there being no natural link between them? (Ch.9:25-26)",
                    "• As regards the second possibility, namely, that the interrelationship is metered and God will grant the person an amount of good that exactly balances the strife he has endured, he finds a contradiction in what he Bildad had said. For in this case, how could he Bildad have urged him to strengthen his resolve and accept the afflictions with joy? For this contradicts his assertion that the anguish is equated with the subsequent delight, <i>justly balanced against it</i> (Job 6:2). For if he braces himself and puts his agony and pain out of mind, his period of misery will just lengthen until he has suffered the measure of torment and anguish apportioned to him. It would be better for him were his torment to be intensified right now, for thereby the duration of his affliction would be shortened. (Ch.9:27-28)",
                    "• Regarding the third possibility, namely, that good comes in exchange for bad through the medium of prayer and mercy, he argues at length that the notion that a person who has been unlawfully hurt and who can exonerate himself before his oppressor both in justice and in law, should pray and plead for mercy instead of demanding justice, is unconscionable. He has committed no crime and should base his appeal on the integrity of his deeds and not plead and beg for forgiveness as though he was guilty. Furthermore, if the Judge is unwilling to acknowledge his righteousness why should He accept his prayers and supplications? Besides, a rationalist <i>would refuse to believe (Leviticus 26:21) </i>that God could ever accept his prayers, for it would mean that His statute is inconsistent, vacillating between favor and disfavor; <i>and He is not like a man, to change His mind</i> (1Samuel 15:29). And so he says: <i>Even were I to call, and He did answer,</i> <i>I don't believe He would listen to my voice (Job 9:16). </i>(Ch.9:13-22)",
                    "Arguing against the fourth possibility, i.e., that this exchange is accomplished through a trial, Job points out that quite often the person being tested may die as a result of the affliction. So where is the redemption, reward and compensation that he is supposed to receive for his suffering and for passing the test? (Ch.9:23)",
                    "Finally, he dismisses the fifth possibility, namely, that the suffering is a prophylactic designed to prevent him sinning in the future. He asks how it can be right for God to afflict a person before he has sinned at all, just in case he might sin in the future? But he has not yet sinned. Why should he be smitten before he has sinned? If and when he sins, let him then be punished, but not before. (Ch.9:29-32)",
                    "<b>Part Three:</b> Job now opens a new campaign against the philosophical thesis <i>so firmly held (Daniel 11:1) </i>by his two companions, that though God knows all detailed matters including those over which an individual has discretion, this pre-knowledge does not prescribe the person's actions and he is still free to act as he chooses. In questioning this, he cites the paradox of the contradiction between foreknowledge and free-will, namely, that since benightedness cannot be attributed to the Lord, may He be Blessed, and He must perforce know all that is going to happen in the future, man is not at liberty with regard to his actions. For his deeds are circumscribed by reason of the Cosmos, whether for good or for bad, and God knows with prior knowledge everything he is destined to do. This being so, Job returns and gives vent to his complain, asking why God makes him suffer for his deeds, seeing that he is compelled to act as he does and can do no good or evil other than that delineated by His actions and designs, from the very beginning of time.",
                    "He goes on to ask the questions posed by the philosophers who challenged the opinion of those who say that God knows all mutable matters down to the last detail: ",
                    "• But such unfolding details can only be ascertained through the workings of a 'hylic force', such as the senses and imagination, and God has no 'hylic force' and so can have no knowledge of these circumstantial trivia.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A hylic force is one that is manifested through something else; until then its existence is only a potential. Mediaeval philosophers divided 'being' into that which exists in itself and that which exists in something else. The latter is designated 'accident'. Accident is then further subdivided into that which exists through the other thing and that which is the cause of the existence of the other thing. The former is again designated 'accident'; the latter is called 'form'. <br>Probably to avoid confusion, Maimonides introduced the term 'force' in place of 'accident' in its general sense, i.e. a 'being' that exists in something else. Hence, 'force' as used by Maimonides designates accidents, forms, the lower faculties of the rational soul, the internal principle of motion and the universals, all of which require something else in which to exist. (Wolfson p.99) </i>",
                    "•  And secondly, that these details are transient, i.e., their existence is in time, but God cannot discern temporal things since He cannot be described either as moving or as being at rest.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to Aristotle, time is an accident that exists in motion, for we have no perception of time unless we have a perception of motion. According to this definition, time is inconceivable without motion and always implies the existence of a movable corporeal object. Thus, incorporeal eternal beings like God cannot have the attribute of time inasmuch as the attribution of time would imply corporeality (Wolfson p.95).</i> As Job says: <b>Do You have eyes of flesh, and see as men do? Are Your days as the days of a mortal, and Your years as those of a man?</b> (Job 10:4-5)  Implicit in this passage are all the other objections raised by the philosopher,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The philosopher disputant answered by Maimonides in Part III Sections 16–21 of The Guide for the Perplexed. </i> namely:  <br>\t• That were this so,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., that God knows all mutable particulars. </i> the Honorable One would be less than perfect, for its knowledge is the perfection of a 'knowing-being'.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mutable particulars are by definition imperfect and so knowledge of them would impair God's Perfection.</i> <br>• \tThat God could not be Immutable Unity, since a 'knowing-being' is augmented by the knowledge it acquires and how can Immutable Unity be augmented by various different notions?

And all of these points are implicit in the first two original questions.<i class=\"footnote\">That since God has no hylic force (no sense perception) how can He ascertain mutable particulars and since the particulars are time-dependent how can He, who is above time, discern them?</i>",
                    "On the basis of all of this, Job concludes that man is compelled to act as he does, in which case all these objections fall away: ",
                    "• For God, may He be Blessed, knows all these minutiae by virtue of their commonality. He has known since the beginning of time that all these acts and other particulars were ordained and necessitated by universal governance. ",
                    "• He does not have to ascertain these things through a 'hylic force', for He knows the logical order these things have by virtue of being formulated and circumscribed from the very beginning of time. Accordingly, He does not learn of them from their emergence in time, for by reason of being ordered they were so foreordained from the very beginning of time.",
                    "• Accordingly, He does not learn of them from their emergence in time, for by reason of being ordered they were so foreordained from the very beginning of time.",
                    "• Consequently, it cannot be argued that He is augmented by the knowledge of these things. Just the opposite; it is His Knowledge of them that necessitates their existence. ",
                    "• Nor does any problem arise from the fact that these bits of information increase in number and have no purpose. For it is by virtue of the rational order that foreordains them that they assume significance and form a coherent whole.",
                    "All of this requires that there be nothing in existence that depends on man's choice. For if there were, all the above queries would <i>return home</i> (1 Samuel 25:26). A person's deeds are all simply determined and apportioned from the beginning of time, and God, may He be Blessed, knows everything in one eternal, universal, and immutable knowledge, which neither changes, nor increases, nor evolves; neither as a result of the increase in the number of things in existence nor by virtue of those events which depend, according to our imagination, on time or choice. For He knows everything through His perception of Himself, upon which the linking of all the causes and all their effects depends, through to the end of the series.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This mechanistic-deterministic view is resonant of Descartes' writings, though his solution to the problem of free-will and God's foreknowledge is quite different. Descartes held that 'freedom of the will is self-evident.' Doubt was the human faculty that proved this. On the other hand, he also asserted that 'we likewise know that everything is pre-ordained of God…His power is so immense that it would be a crime for us to think ourselves ever capable of ding anything which He had not already pre-ordained.' He reconciled these two apparently opposing statements as follows: <br>We will have no trouble at all if we recollect that our thought is finite, and that the omnipotence of God, whereby He has not only known from all eternity that which is or can be, but also willed and pre-ordained is, is infinite. In this way we may have intelligence enough to know that this power is in God, but not enough to know how He leaves the free action of man indeterminate; and, on the other hand, we are as conscious of the liberty which exists in us that there is nothing that we comprehend more clearly and perfectly.

They had only challenged, each in his own way, his assertion that a truly righteous person had actually perished. However, now comes Zophar and he totally rejects the major premise of the syllogism, arguing that in his opinion, it is conceivable that even though God governs, a righteous person may nevertheless suffer, for no injustice is necessarily implied even if <i>a righteous man perishes in his righteousness</i> (Ecclesiastes 7:15). This approach is based on what has been demonstrated by philosophical research, namely, that the perception of things <i>has two aspects (Zechariah 13:8)</i>:",
                    " 1. The perception of things as they are in themselves;",

In the eclectic tradition of Jewish theologians, Malbim seized upon Kant's revolutionary ideas about the subjectivity of space and time, viz., that they are the transcendental framework of our consciousness, and his distinction between phenomena, the external properties of an object which are accessible and can be comprehended by the mind, and noumena, the object's essential and eternal properties which are beyond human comprehension. He adopted this new epistemology, wherever it was useful, in support of his theological opinions and beliefs. Malbim was not the only orthodox Jewish writer who found Kant an aid to his theology (Rosenbloom, p.192-197).</i>",
                    "And regarding ourselves, it is evident that there is no way we can perceive things as they are in themselves, but only as they affect our senses. <br>Now, since all human knowledge and learning is acquired through the senses, this being how the intellect derives its learning, inferring what was prior from that which is subsequent;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This theory of learning is Aristotelian:<br>Aristotle, in opposition to Plato, not only affirmed the existence of a world external to humanity but also maintained that our ideas about the world are obtained by abstracting from it ideas common to various classes of material objects we perceive such as triangles, spheres, foliage and mountains...Thus true knowledge is obtained from sense experience, by intuition and by abstraction. These abstractions have no existence independent of human minds...In his words, we must 'start with things which are knowable and observable to us and proceed toward those things which are clearer and more knowable by nature'. (Kline p.5)</i> and since the modalities of sense perception are not the inherent modalities of the entities, we cannot judge things as they really are in themselves, but only as their external surfaces relate to our senses and to the modalities by which the senses experience their sensations in time and in place, and subject to the other circumstances of the senses. Hence, we cannot assert that these are really the inherent modalities of the entities and so we can have no certain knowledge of anything. For we can only judge that this is how we have perceived the exterior of the thing, as it affected our senses; not that this is how the thing is, inherently. But intellect that is naked of matter perceives the essence of things in direct knowledge, not through the medium of the senses. It will perceive things differently from the way we see them using our 'viewing instruments', i.e., our senses.",
                    "Accordingly, though in terms of external sense perception it is an offense if we see a righteous person perish, it may not be such an injustice to the abstract intellect, which perceives the essence of the things as they are in themselves.

                    "• We judge who is righteous through the impressions gained by our senses. If we see someone doing good and avoiding evil we judge him to be a righteous person. Yet it is possible that though our senses perceive him to be righteous, he is inherently wicked. For we cannot perceive the person as he is in himself, only as he appears to us in his external body. The outer coat that envelopes the essence of man, the soul that is concealed within the body. We cannot comprehend matters of the soul or what constitutes righteousness and evil in its terms, for the senses have no perception of the soul that is man's essence. Consequently, though he may be righteous according to his somatic behavior, he may nevertheless be wicked in terms of the perfection required for his inner soul.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As Maimonides wrote in his Commentary on the Mishna: Sanhedrin 10:<br><i>Know that just as a blind man can form no idea of colors, nor a deaf man of sounds, nor a eunuch of the desire for sexual intercourse, so the body cannot comprehend the delights of the soul…For we live in a material world and the only pleasure we can comprehend is physical pleasure. But the delights of the spirit are everlasting and continuous, and there is no resemblance between spiritual and bodily enjoyments</i>.</i>",
                    "• This conforms with the opinion expressed by those Talmudic Sages who posited that Job lived before the giving of the Torah [at Mt. Sinai] and that his righteousness was just civilized probity in matters concerning human relations.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Bereshit Raba 57.4</i> However, there are religious ordinances and perfections needed for the perfection of the soul that cannot be ascertained by means of the intellect. Nor can it be perfected through civilized behavior which designates what is good and bad only by reference to the governance of physical bodies. Thus, in terms of its constitution, which is unknown to man, he [Job] had not perfected his soul and it is possible that it is by virtue of this that he was considered wicked.",
                    "This also conforms with Gersonides' statement<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Gersonides glosses on Job 11:20. </i> that a person's righteousness or wickedness depends on what he was capable of doing relative to his individual make-up. For man was created to do what he can according to his disposition. Consequently, we may consider some people to be good because of the good deeds we see them doing, when in fact by reference to their make-up, they are doing much less than they should be. Because of this, they deserve severe punishment, for relative to them, minor sins should be considered major ones by virtue of the superior level of their make-up. On the basis of this supposition, we cannot argue that the evils which befall the righteous are unfair, for we cannot specify or measure the predilections bestowed on each individual member of mankind. Hence, who is righteous and who is evil is hidden from us. Nor do we have the necessary information about how much good or evil each person deserves for his disobedience or his righteousness. And so we cannot say that if he does not receive a particular amount [of good or evil], then God does not govern in an orderly and honest manner. For the amount of good or bad warranted by the goodness or worthlessness of their deeds should be adjusted for the differences in the make-up of each individual, by inverse proportion. That is to say, the reward for a particular deed should vary according to the ranking of the performer; the higher his intrinsic level the smaller should be the reward and the greater should be his punishment for an evil deed. All of this is implied in his [Zophar's] statement: <b>That He would tell you of wisdom's mysteries; how reality is folded double. So you might know, God has exacted less from you than your iniquity warranted</b> (Job 11:6). ",
                    "•  As regards the predicate [of the syllogism], viz. 'perish', we consider 'perishing' to be the annihilation of the physical body. For since we can only perceive what is palpable and not the essentials of things, as was explained above, we cannot perceive the intrinsic man. But in truth, though a person's exterior may perish, his essence, which is his internal soul, may thereby achieve bliss and perfection; <i>excelling in pride and excelling in might</i> (Genesis 49:3). <br>The external pain that the senses feel is not proof of an internal pain, that of the soul itself. As has already been explained by the wise: <br><i>True reward and punishment are not to be found in these perceptible misfortunes; that is, it is fitting that reward and punishment befalling man as a human being be through human goods and human misfortunes, not through benefits and misfortunes which are not human. Since this is the case, and [since] human goods consist of acquiring well-being of the soul - for this belongs to man by virtue of his humanity - not in acquiring sweet foods and [pleasant] sensory objects, for nutrition and sensation do not belong to man by virtue of his humanity, and also since human misfortune consists of the absence of well-being of the soul - I mean that its development be inadequate - it is clear that reward and punishment which befalls man by virtue of his humanity lies in the well-being of the soul and in the lack of such well-being...Since acquisition of well-being of the soul itself depends upon good and just actions...the good and evil which befall man by virtue of his humanity, proceed...in accordance with order and justice.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gersonides' The Wars of the Lord, Part 4 Chapter 6, translated by J. David Bleich.</i></i> <br>And so, even though the body may perish, the soul lives on; continuing to exist, eternal and receiving its reward after death. Regarding this, Zophar says; <b>The real you will yet forget the misery, remembering it like flood waters long gone. For the timeless Hereafter will rise at midday, like daybreak breaking from the shadows, You can be sure of it, for there is hope, When buried in the ground, you will lie in safety, At rest, none shall make you afraid, Yea many will come to seek your intercession</b> (Job 11:16-19).",
                    " As regards the long campaign Job had waged in Chapter 10 to prove that man has no freedom over his acts, for if he had, it would be impossible for the Blessed One to know the details of all possible future events [and that would mean that He is not Omniscient], Zophar replies as did Maimonides when he stated that inferences cannot be drawn between our knowledge and God's Knowledge, may He be Blessed. For just as the level of His Existence is higher than that of our existence, so the level of His Knowledge is higher than that of our knowledge. And so it must be, since His Knowledge is He Himself and just as we cannot appreciate His Essence so we cannot appreciate His Knowledge. Philosophers have already explained that the term 'knowledge' when applied to God, may He be Blessed, and to us is but a homonym. And clearly, when entities are homonyms, nothing can be proved about the one from the other. Accordingly, Maimonides explains that His Knowledge, may He be Blessed, is distinguishable from ours in five ways:",
                    "1.\tThat His Unique Knowledge is both appropriate and commensurate with the many different types of things.",
                    "2.\tThat His Knowledge applies to things not existing.",

                    "4.\tThat God's Knowledge, may He be Blessed, of things that will happen in the future does not predetermine the known thing but leaves possible its nullification, so that concurrently with the Knowledge, the attributes of possibility and choice still remain.",
                    "5.\tThat God's Knowledge, may He be Blessed, is not changed by innovations in those things of which He had knowledge before they came into existence, even though the thing to which the Knowledge applied has already changed, such that what was at first a potentiality has subsequently become a reality.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Malbim changed the order in this paraphrase of the list from Guide to the Perplexed III,20.</i>",
                    "None of these can be described by our intellect or wisdom, for 'knowledge' attributed to us is not the same as 'Knowledge' attributed to Him, may He be Blessed. Nor can we comprehend how and in what way He Knows, just as we cannot comprehend His Blessed Essence. The nature of this Knowledge requires that it be inscrutable and incomprehensible to us. This concept is implicit in Zophar's assertion that we can only appreciate things through the medium of our senses and cannot know the perception of an intellect that is totally divorced from matter: one which comprehends the essence of things from the prior to the subsequent, which is a different type of comprehension.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Different from sense perception which induces from what is posterior – the observed physical phenomena, what was prior – the underlying universals or general qualities.</i> And above all, we can never comprehend God's Knowledge, may He be Blessed; He Who is Transcendental. And this is what Zophar meant when he inquired: <br><b>Can you fathom the depth of God? Can you determine the reach of the Almighty? T'is high as heaven; what can you make of it? Deeper than Sheol; what can you know of it? Its girth is greater than the earth and wider than the sea</b> (Job 11:7-9). <br>Accordingly, he concludes that though the Lord, may He be Blessed, knows all future events, individuals still have choice and discretion over their deeds. Man cannot pose the question of 'knowledge and free-will'; he cannot claim that if the Lord, may He be Blessed, already knew that he would sin, he was compelled to sin and why then should he be punished, for this is something whose meaning we can never comprehend (Ch.11:10-11).",
                    "Furthermore, it cannot be denied that man does have free-will by virtue of the feeling every person has in his soul that whatever he wants or chooses to do, he has the possibility of doing, and no external force prevents him (Ch.11:13).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Once again, an idea reminiscent of Descartes: <br>Finally it is so evident that we are possessed of a free-will that can give or withhold its assent, that this may be counted as one of the first and most ordinary notions that are found innately in us. We had before a very clear proof of this, for at the same time as we tried to doubt all things and even supposed that He who created us employed His unlimited powers in deceiving us in every way, we perceived in ourselves a liberty such that we were able to abstain from believing what was not perfectly certain and indubitable. But that of which we could not doubt at such a time is as self-evident and clear as anything we can ever know. (Principles of Philosophy 39)</i>",
                    "And finally, if a person asks why God created man in this way and not with the faculty to perceive things as they are in themselves; capable to learn from the prior to the subsequent without need of the senses and not to be bewildered by these doubts? He replies that this is like asking why God did not give intellect to donkeys and make them as clever as men. Had He done so, donkeys, as such, would not have existed. God wanted man to exist as 'intellect wedded to matter'. If man gained intelligence other than through the senses, he would have been 'intellect divorced from matter', and humanity as such would not have existed (Ch.11:12)."

                    "Job <i>pours great scorn (Ezekiel 23:32) </i>on Zophar's philosophical method, that by which he had determined that since we possess knowledge only by reason of our senses as they apprehend the exterior of things, and we do not perceive the reality of things as they are in themselves, it is conceivable that though a person may appear to be righteous according to our sense perception, he is in truth wicked and is deserving of perdition and torment by reference to his inner spiritual essence. Is there anything more ludicrous, asks Job, than that a person who appears to be virtuous in all his acts and beyond suspicion, should be told that he does not really know his own mind or its intrinsic state, in terms of which he may be both wicked, and a sinner, <i>and deserving of misfortunes</i>? (Job 12:5), Is it conceivable that God created man in such <i>an evil and bitter manner</i> (Jeremiah 2:19) <i>for scorn and for ridicule</i> (Ezekiel 23:32); so that his <i>calm and secure thoughts (Amos 6:1) </i>about his righteousness are as <i>a burning torch inside him (Isaiah 62:1) heaping coals of fire (Proverbs 25:22) </i>and mockery on his head? <i>For not knowing his soul (Proverbs 14:9) nor trusting his life</i> (Job 24:22), he is perhaps a criminal and guilty, but does not know it! (Ch.12:3-4).",
                    "Similarly, as regards to the central idea of his philosophy, that man does not have a clear perception or knowledge of the reality of things and it might be just the opposite of what he feels it to be. Concerning this, <i>he builds a fortification and rampart (Ezekiel 4:2) </i>and proves that the knowledge humans gain by examination and experience, using their senses, is clear and true knowledge. For we see that everything an individual discerns through his senses and his investigations was also observed by the whole multitude of mankind in every generation. <i>Thus, it is heard in his ears (Job 28:22) </i>through an unbroken tradition, that all human perceptions and knowledge are at one with his knowledge. Hence, his knowledge is plainly clear and true, and as he perceives the natural qualities of things and their actuality, so they are. For it is impossible that misguided imagination has led the whole of mankind astray. (Ch.12:11-12 &amp; 13:1-2)",
                    "He also pours scorn on the tenet of his philosophical theory according to which even though God has foreknowledge of those elective particulars that are equivalent to absolute future knowledge, it is still conceivable that contingency exists and choice is in man's hand; the tenet that the term 'knowledge' applies to God and to us as a homonym and His Knowledge is not like our knowledge. That, whereas He perceives the essence of things in a lucid knowledge which is independent of time and place and other sensory parameters, we cannot conceive this Knowledge, just as the skin cannot imagine the senses. And that, in consequence, the difference between His Knowledge and our knowledge is like that between man's perception and an animal's <i>or a wild ass's foal</i>. (Job 11:12) <br>Regarding this matter Job's opinion is similar to that of Gersonides who went to great lengths to reply to the position taken by <i>The Guide:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Maimonides' Guide to the Perplexed. </i></i> <br><i>It would seem that His knowledge, may He be Blessed, is equivocal with our knowledge by priority and posteriority. I mean to say that the term 'knowledge' is said of God, may He be Blessed, priorly and of any other being posteriorily. This is because He has His knowledge from His own essence whereas the knowledge of other beings is caused by His knowledge...This being the case, it would seem that there is no difference between the knowledge of God, may He be Blessed, and our knowledge except that the knowledge of God, may He be Blessed, is more perfect than our knowledge...is more true in precision and clarity</i>. <small>(The Wars of the Lord Part 3 Chapter 3. Norbet M. Samuelson translation).</small> <br>And not that it should be different and mutable in the way that <i>The Guide</i> wrote, so that what is designated opinion or error or confusion with reference to us is designated knowledge with reference to Him. <br>Accordingly, all the proofs presented by Job in Chapter 10 are reinstated: <br> 1.\tThat we cannot hold that God has foreknowledge of all elective particulars but contingency still exists and choice is in man's hand; for according to our knowledge these are contradictory things. Whence he [Job] returns to the conclusion he had previously drawn, namely, that man is compelled to act as he does and can do nothing other than that which God already knows with His prior knowledge that he must do by virtue of his destiny. He is just like the rest of the animals who have no discretion and whose actions are instinctive and inexorable. (Ch.12:7-13)",
                    "2.\tThat the Almighty, may He be Blessed, rules and determines man's discretionary acts just as He determines all natural matters. Like the element water, which sometimes floods the earth and sometimes lays waste and dries up. And all this is done by nature and of necessity. So too are the actions <i>of one man to another</i> (Proverbs 27:19). (Ch.12:14-16)",
                    "As further evidence that persons must act as prescribed, He cites the way societies, nations and peoples are governed.

The Hebrew term used by Malbim - כח אחר - is found in the Talmud (TB Baba Kama 3b) where it designates the tendency of fire to spread.</i> <i>confounds their counsel and confuses their thinking</i>, (TB Berachot 17a ) as he explains at length (Ch.12:17-25).",
                    "Accordingly, <i>he cries out bitterly (Genesis 27:34) </i>that since he is compelled to act as he does, he receives no reward for his righteousness; that he has been handed over to the occurrences and evils which the signs of his horoscope have prescribed for him; that God should desist and allow him freedom over his acts so that he might receive his reward, like an employee who does his work faithfully, and <i>not labor in vain...and in terror</i> (Isaiah 65:23). (Ch.14:5) <br>Furthermore, since a human being's days are <i>few and evil (Genesis 47:9) </i>and by the nature of his birth he is prone to uncleanliness and corruption, and must battle with his instincts, he should at least be free to act as he chooses <i>until, like a hired laborer, he completes his day</i> (Job 14:6). (Ch.14:1-5)",
                    "As regards Zophar's supposition that the essential substance of success and recompense is to be found after death, for then one has the hope of living a spiritual life <i>in everlasting bliss (Psalms 16:11)</i>, he [Job] mocks his words at length (in line with his view, which denies the resurrection of the dead and spiritual reward). (Ch.14:7-22)",
                    "At the same time as he rebuts Zophar's thesis, he also expresses his resentment throughout Chapter 13 at the pretense of his three companions in their campaign against him. They themselves knew that there was no substance to anything they had said and they had only brought the conventionally required arguments like hypocrites, <i>speaking wickedness to defend God</i>, <i>and for His sake, uttering falsehoods</i>; (Job 13:7) words which were themselves far from what was in their own minds. And so he once again asks that they tell him in what he had sinned and how many were his sins. All of which brings to a close the first cycle of their debate on the question of the suffering of a righteous person.",

The answer to this question cannot proceed from any of the philosophical theories hitherto proposed. For the evil of a wicked person is clear and evident to all and it cannot be suggested that he is really secretly righteous when we see that he plunders <b>and provokes God  </b>(Job 12:6) and purposely does wicked deeds. And yet, nevertheless, <i>his home is at peace, unafraid nor is God's rod raised against him</i> (Job 21:9).

                    "Towards the end of his oration, Job had raised the second question on the agenda, namely, that concerning the prosperity of the wicked. Since this subject had not been addressed by his companions in their replies to the question of the suffering of the wicked, the debaters return for a second round in which each presents his opinion regarding this new question.",
                    "Eliphaz is of the opinion that the prosperity of the wicked is illusory: it is not true prosperity. Though, at first sight, the wicked person may appear successful, acquiring wealth, strength and possessions, his heart is ever full of fear. He feels at all times as if <i>pursued by the sword</i> (Leviticus 26:37), as though hard times were coming; as if <i>destitution and poverty</i> (Psalms 82:3) were about to overtaken him. So much so, that despite his wealth he has no pleasure from it nor has any peace of mind. And this is one of God’s punishments <i>for doing wrong in His eyes and provoking Him to anger</i> (Deuteronomy 4:25). He [God] confuses the wicked person's mind, his thoughts and his imagination with fear and trembling. For the essence of prosperity is peace of mind, an unworried spirit and a joyful heart; <i>better a dry crust and tranquility with it</i> (Proverbs 17:1). ",
                    "Now this is exactly what had happened to Job, for he had admitted: <i>I had a terrifying premonition and it has come to be</i>. (Job 3:25) Moreover, this continuous fear, which haunts [the wicked person], is a portent of his own doom. For ultimately, he, his descendants and all that he has will be wiped out, as had happened to Job. This is the thrust of Eliphaz’s opinion.",
                    "However, at the opening of his speech he chides Job once again for denying that the soul is recompensed in the world to come. Though he may deny physical resurrection, he surely cannot deny the survival of the eternal soul upon which real happiness and lasting prosperity depend (Ch.15:11-13).",
                    "Likewise regarding Job’s denial of free-will and his assertion that man is compelled to act as he does. Though Eliphaz had already challenged him on this matter in his first speech, he confronts him again, He points out that <i>all reflective thinkers</i> (Exodus 28:3) feel in themselves that they have free-will and that there is no external force compelling them to act as they do (Ch.15:18-19). And furthermore, since individuals have freedom of action they are held accountable, and it is inconceivable that such an individual has not committed some sin for which he deserves punishment. So God chastises him with some temporary punishment, with suffering in this world, in order to save his eternal soul.",
                    "All of this is just a repetition of his first speech, with the exception that he had not previously spelled out the idea that the punishment is intended to save the person from the severing of the soul, and that the suffering befalls him only temporarily so that he not perish forever as a result of the death of his body before its time. Job had disputed this notion at the time and had shown that it makes no difference whether one dies now (for the period of suffering is considered like a death) or whether one dies later, as he explained at length in Chapter 7. But now Eliphaz explains to him that souls are recompensed and that the life of the souls is eternal life; suffering and even temporary death are better than eternal perdition (Ch.15:14-17).",
                    "Besides, whereas Eliphaz had at first attributed to Job the minor sin of not worshipping God out of love, he now regards him to be a totally wicked person, seeing how <i>he had opened his mouth</i> (Isaiah 5:14) to deny all the corner-stones of faith. It was evident from his words that he had not spoken out of his suffering for <i>a person should not be held responsible for his anguish</i> (Baba Batra 16b). However, from the way his statements were formulated and the fact that he put forward his thesis in such learned language, it was clear that he had been contemplating and working out these things over a long time, a time when he had still been at ease (Ch.15:2,7).",
                    "Apart from this, he derides Job's arrogance and stupidity for complaining that man was ever created, as though he was the first person ever created. Countless generations have already passed, that saw life and rejoiced in their toil, all of whom <i>have given thanks to the Lord for His lovingkindness</i> (Psalms 107: 8,15,21,31). Would he gainsay the whole world? <i>Will the clay ask the potter what he is making; or his handiwork say 'You are unskilled'? (Isaiah 45:9) </i> (Chapter 15:7-11). "

For if this is so, <i>man is no better than the animals; the death of the one being no different from the death of the other; all drawing the same breath (Ecclesiastes 3:19)</i>, In which case, why did God create man in His image, <i>breathing a living soul into him</i> (Genesis 2:7); one that knows and thinks? Viewed in this way, the human psyche is worthless and its presence in man is only to his own detriment; there, just to make him understand <i>that his end is utter annihilation</i> (Numbers 24:20). But since we see that God has endowed man with wondrous spiritual powers, the like of which are not found in the souls of the other animals, it is clear that this is the essential feature of man and that his soul does not perish with the mortal body but lives on eternally, for ever.

From which it follows, that it is the well-being of the soul that matters, for it is this that distinguishes man from the beasts. It is not physical well-being that matters, for man's body is just like that of the animals. Hence, the prosperity that a wicked person achieves in this world through material possessions, those that are intended only for bodily enjoyment, is not real prosperity. Accordingly, he explains that a wicked person’s punishment is that nothing will remain of him or of his existence, for his spiritual soul will be cut off and doomed; <i>never to be illumined in eternal bliss with the light of the living (Job 33:30). </i>Nothing of his will endure, neither his children, his name nor his remembrances on earth, and this is the most horrifying punishment of all.

However, his arguments are only pertinent if the exchange takes place in this world; that it is here that God rewards the person with good in compensation for the bad he has suffered, and not in the Hereafter. But if He compensates the person with an everlasting spiritual reward that is bestowed on his eternal soul, granting him eternal bliss in recompense for the temporary suffering, Job's submissions fail, and <i>the Lord's justice is vindicated along with Him (Psalms 19:10). </i>Thus, all of Job's responses are rebutted; <i>all gone up in smoke</i> (Psalms 37:20).

                    "•  For Eliphaz was wrong when he said that the wicked are always full of fear and feel insecure despite their prosperity. On the contrary, there are wicked people who are both self-assured and contented (ibid. 9-11).",
                    "•  Nor is Bildad’s response that their kind, together with their collective and individual progeny, will be cut off, correct. For there are many wicked people whose children are alive and well off (ibid. 8) and whose homes are steadfast (ibid. 20-29).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This reference to the text appears to be a misprint in the Hebrew text, as the evildoer's home is barely mentioned in them. Most probably Malbim intended verses 9 and 21.</i> As for his statement that their souls will be cut off and they will be punished in the eternity of the Hereafter, who knows anything about this hidden punishment that is concealed from every eye? Death spreads its wings over all flesh, indiscriminately (ibid. 30-34). Like the righteous, so are the wicked gathered to the grave; and who knows whether there is wisdom or knowledge, or any reckoning,  <i>in the Sheol whither they all are bound (Ecclesiastes 9:10)</i>. ",
                    "•  Neither does he accept Zophar's answer that the wicked will suddenly die  <i>and descend living to Sheol (Numbers 16:30)</i>. For this too is part of their good-fortune: to die without suffering, something that he [Job] himself longs for (ibid. 12-13). Furthermore, is it right and just that a righteous person who has endured suffering should die with a bitter soul, whilst a wicked person dies in his prime and at ease; and that both should finish up in the grave, righteous and wicked alike (ibid. 22-26)? And even if the wicked person's sons are cut down after his death, the wicked person does not feel this punishment as he no longer exists. God's punishments should touch him personally; and the duration of his agony should be lengthened, so that he recognize God's retribution (ibid. 17-22). ",

                    "With the completion of <i>two rounds, six [orations] in each round</i>, (Leviticus 24:6) the first concerning the suffering of the righteous and the second the prosperity of the wicked; and after the wrangler Job had triumphed over all of them with his answers, <i>his bows and his arrows (Genesis 48:22)</i>; Eliphaz now tries, for one last time, <i>to fit his arrow to the bowstring</i> (Psalms 11:2) <i>in order to counter-attack at the gate (Isaiah 28:6)</i> in a single speech that addresses both issues. In doing so, he devises a new approach, <i>one with fine insight and knowledge (Psalms 119:66)</i>, according to which it is out of wisdom on God's part, and with particular intent, that the rewards of the righteous and the punishments of the wicked are not immediately disbursed in this world. This is done so as to ensure that the worship of God may be selfless, motivated neither by love of reward nor by fear of punishment.",
                    "For the most important aspect of a person's worship of God is that he should do good for its own sake and for the sake of the <i>Profound Statute</i> issued by the Supreme Lawgiver; and principally <i>for the sake of His great Name (2Chronicles 6:32)</i>. However, this would not be the case if a person's actions were guided by considerations of reward or fear of punishment. For he would then be serving not God but himself and this is not the sort of worship God desires. <i>If the reaction to evil acts was immediate</i> (Ecclesiastes 8:11) and God meted out punishment to the wicked at once, <i>nobody would dare</i> (Jeremiah 30:21) to do evil for fear of the immediate retribution that would follow. Similarly, everyone would try to do good because they knew they would be rewarded instantly. The deed would not be performed for the sake of God, nor would there be any meaning to reward and punishment, seeing that all would be bound to act as they did out of fear of punishment or hope of reward. Nor would there be any meaning to free-will and trial, though they were the substance of God's purpose in creating man: that the heart's inclination should tempt a person to do evil and he should feel free to do so, but that nevertheless he should refrain <i>and turn away from evil (Psalms 34:15)</i>, out of respect for God and His divine ordinances. Therefore, <i>He endowed man's mind with everything, except the knowledge of how God acts</i> (Ecclesiastes 3:11) with regard to the reward of the righteous or the punishment of the wicked. And so there are evil-doers who prosper and wicked persons who are praised in public for what they have done and God's Providence is concealed and hidden from the sight of most people. Contrariness beguiles understanding, causing it to deny Providence and to declare that <i>the world runs itself (TB Avodah Zarah 54b)</i>; that everything depends on heredity, nature and the stars; <i>that the Lord is on high, His glory is above the heavens (Psalms 113:4)</i>, and He does not govern those down below; not to mention the other charges made by heretics. As proof, they all cite the disorder and capriciousness of Providence, namely, that the righteous languish and the wicked prosper. ",
                    "But this is a test and a trial, intended to distinguish between those who worship God sincerely and those who are insincere. For he who serves God <i>without thought of reward (TB Avodah Zarah 19a)</i>, <i>the righteous person who lives in faithfulness (Habakkuk 2:4)</i>, he will not be moved. He will receive his reward in the world of recompense—an eternal spiritual reward in shimmering Paradise—for he has been tried and found perfect. For in the world of souls, <i>scourges are also readied for the scorners (Proverbs 19:29);</i> <i>for God brings every secret thing to judgment (Ecclesiastes 12:14);</i> <i>a faithful just God, who does no wrong (Deuteronomy 32:4);</i> <i>all of whose work endures (Psalms 33:4).</i> <br>Thus, Eliphaz <i>rebuilds and re-establishes (Ezra 2:68)</i> his original theses: ",
                    "• his assertions that the reason for the suffering of the righteous is to punish them in this world for any minor sins they may have committed so as to indemnify them in the world to come,",
                    "• and that though the wicked may prosper, their prosperity is imperfect for their hearts are filled with fear of the punishment that awaits them. Even though in most cases this will only befall them in the world of souls, their own hearts are already auguring evil for them. ",
                    "In this way he also justifies his reproof of Job at the beginning of his first speech, when he had said: '<b>Was not your own security the reason for your piety?</b>' (Job 4:6). For the essence of correct worship is that it should be performed without any expectation of repayment or fear of retribution, and in this Job had sinned, <i>Therefore his steps faltered (Psalms 37:31)</i>, <i>and God poured His wrath upon him (Lamentations 4:11).</i> ",

We the readers will still ask why God had to prove His assessment to be right? Was it not sufficient that He had declared that Job was 'a sincere and upright man ...'?

That he had not worshiped with sincerity, for the sake of God alone, but had had other considerations in mind, such as the hope of reward and fear of punishment. Therefore, <i>God refines him with suffering (Psalms 105:19),</i> <i>in order to humble him; to test him out;</i> <i>ultimately to benefit him</i> (Deuteronomy 8:16) in the world to come.",

For if punishment was immediate, people would be terrified of doing evil and so would have no choice. Moreover, worship would not then be for the sake of Heaven.",
                    "Job now presents a vigorous rebuttal of these propositions, dealing with each separately....",
                    "•  Regarding the first, Job asks how God could possibly have afflicted him with such terrible suffering because, when he prayed, the improper thought that he might thereby attain some advantage might have passed through his mind? However, he had at all times <i>kept the charge of His commandments and laws</i> (Deuteronomy 11:1) and nothing he had done was so wrong that it justified such a severe punishment (Ch.23:6-7). <br>Moreover, if he could converse with God, who knows the truth, the fact that his worship had not been motivated by any extraneous considerations, but had been for the sake of God alone, would become clear. For though, during his devotions, the thought of how much he depended on God for the procurement of his needs and all his other concerns had sometimes entered his mind, momentarily, he would immediately take hold of himself and return to them, without expectation and just for His sake. And from this he proves that his righteousness had been apportioned and foreordained from the very first, by Paramount foreknowledge. And so he had received no reward for it, but had been left to the happenstance of the stars and to the suffering that the fortune of his nativity prescribed (Ch.23:10-17).",
                    "•  As regards the second proposition, he dismisses Eliphaz's ideas about the prosperity of the wicked. He points to the existence of those evil-doers who destroy civilized society, disrupting the tranquillity of mankind, but whom God does not <i>have it in mind (Job 4:18)</i> to destroy in order to be rid of their evil, thus preventing them from devastating the world. For if there was Divine Governance, it would be proper for it to protect the general public from such scourges and destroyers of civilization. Furthermore, these wild-men live in remote deserts or on islands in the sea and it is from there they make sorties from time to time to plunder, to murder and to destroy many souls. And if God were to exterminate them in their hide-outs, no-one would know about it and so no damage would be done to the concept of worship or free-will. Therefore, <i>they should be wiped out from under God’s heaven (Lamentations 3:66)</i>, by reason of the Divine Governance of man.",

He wishes to approach God as he is. Eliphaz is convinced that the answer to Job's affliction is to be found in an understanding of the workings of Governance. In his opinion, Job is not a special case but just another person who is not quite as righteous as his own estimate of himself. But Job insists that he is a special case.

However, Malbim interprets them as referring, respectively, to north and south, thus completing the four points of the compass. Malbim adds that the ancients imagined the north as being open; that God had not completed Creation in this direction. This notion appears in Bamidbar Rabbah 2:19 and Pirkei de Rabbi Eliezer 3 where the reason He left the northern quarter unfinished was so that anyone who claims to be God could prove he was by completing it. Expanding on this theme, Malbim writes: <br><i>He had left this side [the north] uncovered, without ramparts and walls. Like someone who builds a house without cedar-beam supports and without enclosing it with wooden planks or walls. Taking up this metaphor, Job says that he cannot see God there even though that direction is wide open. However, though the north may have been left exposed, the southern side was enclosed. The upshot is that he cannot perceive God in any direction</i>.  <br>Malbim continues: <i>Perception of God by reason of Himself is designated 'Frontal Perception.' No human being can perceive this or have any conception of it. Humans can only perceive Him from behind, namely, by virtue of the Creation that ensues from Him. That through His Creations we can appreciate the Creator; and through the effects, the Prime Cause. As is written: 'You will see My back, but My face shall not be seen.' (Exodus 33:23). Accordingly, Job states that looking east, i.e., looking for the truth of God's Self as He really is, He appears not to exist, for this view is hidden from human intelligence and so the Creator is never found there. He can only be detected from the reverse side, where His existence is manifest and can be perceived; yet He remains inscrutable, His ways being beyond human understanding. Now, in the Holy Texts [Scripture], governance of the world by Nature is designated 'Governance of the Left' and governance by means of wonders and miracles is designated 'Governance of the Right,' as is written everywhere. Accordingly, he [Job] states that if he investigates Nature's governance, he finds it to be an unroofed and unfinished structure, for there is no proper order to its governance, there being righteous persons who have a hard time of it and wicked ones who have it good. And if he looks right, i.e., towards His miraculous Governance, where governance is perfect, he sees nothing for all he is capable of perceiving is the natural governance ordained from the six days of Creation, that decreed by the stars - 'incoherent shadows of death</i>'. </i>"

Though Job had rebuffed all of this, Bildad now <i>gathers his strength (Isaiah 27:5)</i> <i>to re-engage battle at the gate (Isaiah 28:6)</i> in the following way:",
                    "Whilst continuing to maintain that everything is subject to Individual Providence and that God, <i>who surely pays deserts (Isaiah 59:18 et alia)</i>,  will reward the righteous according to his righteousness and the wicked according to his wickedness, Bildad now adds the rider that He is sometimes prevented, by the nature of Universal Governance, from making immediate and individual recompense or retribution, because Universal Governance precludes it. <br>For example:",

The closest match that refers to Hanina ben Dosa is: 'Every day a Divine Voice proclaims from Mt. Horeb: The whole world is sustained by the merit of my son Hanina.' (TB Berachot 17b)<br>Intriguingly, on a page of the Talmud (TB Taanit 25a) devoted mainly to tales of the miracles attributed to Hanina ben Dosa, a statement similar to that brought by Malbim does appear: 'Would you be pleased were I to turn the world back to its beginning?' However, the statement is made not with reference to Hanina but to another Talmudic sage, Eleazar ben Pedath. Was Malbim working from memory and did he make a mistake about the person but not the page?</i> Still the righteous person will yet be rewarded, whether for his righteousness or for the suffering he has endured without cause. For there is another world, a spiritual one, that is not subject to the cosmic forces of this world or to its fortunes, <i>where he will glow in the light of life (Job 33:30)</i>. <br>This is consistent with the opinion he expounded in his first speech, namely, that the sufferings of the righteous are by way of a <i>quid pro quo</i> and he will be rewarded for his suffering in the future. Except that there he had not explained his opinion well and so Job had dismissed it off hand. He now explains that this <i>quid pro quo</i> is not because God wants to afflict him now so as to be good to him later, for this would prompt the reply <i>neither your sting nor your honey! (Numbers Rabbah 20)</i> Rather, that if the righteous person's luck and the nature of his location, his horoscope, his birth and situation ordain that evil befall him—that he be poor, sick and starving—God will not change Universal Nature for his sake but will instead compensate him, in the future, for the evil he endured because of his bad luck and bad horoscope.

And so, in a similar way, God uproots the righteous person from <i>the land of scorching heat (Hosea 13:5)</i>, where he is destined to misery and scarcity and replants him <i>in the land of the living (Job 28:13)</i>.

And so there is no problem as to why he prospers in this world: his stars are the reason. And yet, <i>he will wither quicker than any other plant (Job 8:12)</i> as in the analogy with the rushes and reed-grass.

                    "He points out that by taking this approach, he [Bildad] is actually reinforcing Job’s own thesis and opinion that it is the Cosmos that rules the world and that it is by its decree that each person's fortune is determined, whether for favor or reproach. for prosperity and joy, or poverty and plague. For though by his insistence that individuals are subject to God’s Governance and that the stars do not predestine an individual’s acts of volition, so there is reward for the good and punishment the wicked, Bildad had differed from Job’s position, he nevertheless recognized that the administration of this Governance does not override the Governance of the Cosmos, and so it is conceivable that what befits a wicked person befalls a righteous one, or vice versa, for God will not alter the Cosmos because of the deeds of the righteous person.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On this view, prayer has no instrumental purpose, for Nature will always decide.</i> Thus, the question of the suffering of the righteous and of the prosperity of the wicked remains in all its force.

",
                    "As regards Bildad's main thesis, namely, that God cannot punish the wicked in this world in violation of its natural order or that of the Cosmos, Job points out that according to Bildad’s own school of thought,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Peripatetic (Aristotelian) school with whom Malbim identifies Bildad.</i> the stars do not rule everything in the world, but only those things that are influenced by the stellar motions by virtue of having elemental qualities in common with them, as is the opinion of the Philosopher expressed in the passage from <i>Sefer Ha-Ikarim </i>quoted in <i>The Introduction to Job’s First Speech</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The relevant part of the quotation is:<br>As for any other signification the stars may have in relation to other things which have no connection with their elemental qualities, as for example in the determination of poverty or wealth, or whether a given person will marry one wife or more than one, or whether he will be virtuous or vicious - this school denies any such power. It is false, they say, and extremely unlikely that the stars should give indications of things which have nothing to do with them, like poverty, wealth love, hate, etc.</i> This being so, God could punish the wicked through those things that do not depend on the motions of the stars.

The laws according to which the waters were first gathered together from over the dry land were invoked by God’s will. They were not implicit in the original nature of the waters themselves.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">'According to the nature of the elements the earth should be covered with the element water...' (Sefer Ha-Ikarrim, Book 4. Chapter 8). Albo is referring to the Aristotelian idea that earth has its natural place at the center of the universe and water, being the next heaviest element, has its natural place immediately above (I. Husik, 1930).</i> For initially, it had been their nature to blanket the entire earth as they did at the beginning of Creation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his commentary on Genesis 1 Malbim adopts the view of Nahmanides that creation (ex nihilo) took place only at the first moment: 'In the beginning, God created Heaven and Earth.' Malbim identifies this 'first creation' with the act of creation described by the Kabbalists as involving the 'contraction' (צמצום) of the Divinity.<br>According to Malbim, the Heaven (שמים) of this 'first creation' is the Cosmos to whose governance Job attributes his misfortunes. No further changes were to be made to this Cosmos by God after its creation; God granted it an autonomy and its governance is therefore independent of Him. During the next six days, only the primeval Earth was affected by God's fiats. Everything it was to comprise had been created at that seminal moment, whether actually or potentially, but was not positioned or expressed until the six days of the creation of the sublunar world. This process required that God make changes in the Earth of the 'first creation'; the Earth was not given autonomy but was subject to God's will, and still is.<br>For example, Malbim explains the firmament (רקיע) that separates between the waters on the earth and those in the atmosphere, as being associated with the new property of evaporation - the law of the force of expansion - with which, on the second day, God endowed the primeval waters that had enveloped the earth after 'first creation'. Similarly, waters were used by God to punish Noah's wicked contemporaries, proving that God can, when He wants, use the earthly elements to exercise His Governance.<br>We might add that though this might have been the case before the Flood, afterwards God promised: 'While the earth lasts, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, shall never cease (Genesis 8:22).' This covenant restricts the agencies available for His Governance of the sublunar world. No mention of this is made in Job. But as we have noted elsewhere Job stands alone amongst the books of the Tnach, as though its protagonists and narrator had no knowledge of the other books or of their contents.</i> Thus, their confluence into seas is contrary to their nature and does not ensue from the Cosmos or from the nature of the world. Hence, God could scatter the wicked by means of water, as happened at the time of the Flood. Let Him now, likewise, punish them by means of the nether elements,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Elements such as Flood and Tempest, that are subject to special natural laws and not to the rule of the Cosmos.</i> through forces that, in the opinion of the Philosopher, are untouched by the Cosmos. [But since this does not happen] it is clear, as is his [Job’s] opinion, that the Cosmos also rules over those things whose elemental qualities have nothing in common with it, including the actions of human beings and their choices, as is the opinion of the astrologers and as is Job’s opinion and philosophical method.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his commentary to Psalms 36, Malbim explains God's Governance as being exercised under two headings. The first is the Natural Governance ordered by the fixed unchanging laws of Nature, such as the cycles of day and night, summer and winter etc.; this Governance, which is designated 'faithfulness' - אמונה in Scripture, is set in Heaven - בשמים - and operates according to fixed laws laid down from its inception. The second is a non-uniform miraculous Governance by which God overrides Nature when required, such as at the crossing of the Red Sea; this Governance is designated 'mercy' - חסד, and is set in the Vault of Heaven - בשחקים.<br>This gives rise to the mistaken view that man's actions, good or evil, do not directly affect the physical world. That only God Himself can affect the workings of Nature; that only through His intervention is mankind rewarded or punished in this world, Nature itself being indifferent to a person's observance of God's ordinances. On this view, reward and punishment are miracles and when God chooses not to intervene, the wicked may prosper and the good suffer, whichever way Nature prescribes at the time.<br>However, continues Malbim, the Torah teaches otherwise. There is a resonance between the deeds of man and Nature; good deeds bring good things and evil deeds bring bad ones: 'If you follow My statutes...I will give you rain at the right time...' (Leviticus 26:2ff). The Creator, in his infinite wisdom, linked the microcosm of man with the macrocosm of Nature, such that the laws of the latter follow on from the volitional acts of the former; Nature's strings resonating to the music made by man. [Malbim acknowledges taking this imagery from Akedat Yitzchak by Isaac Arama].<br>But there is a difference between the two types of requital. Conspicuous miracles, such as the splitting of the Red Sea, are brought about by God's direct intervention: this is designated 'charity' - צדקה. However, the hidden miracles such as rainfall at the right time occur through Nature, as an inherent reaction to man's conduct: this is designated 'law' - משפט. Individual Providence is hidden because were we to receive immediate tangible returns for our deeds we would be no more than trained animals responding to the whip or to lumps of sugar; free-will would be meaningless; man would be just another animal.<br>That the exercise of our intellect can make us act against the dictates of our natural animal instincts demonstrates how man's deeds can affect the physical world. For all the natural laws scattered throughout Creation are contained in man's body; he has within him the entire macrocosm of Nature. Thus, when his human thinking soul determines the laws of the microcosm and places it under its rule, it also subdues the macrocosm, for the two are but a single concern.</i> ",

And God altered this nature and decreed that the water should be gathered to one place.

For initially, the element air was mixed with the element water and it was by virtue of the law of the force of expansion in the air that vapors were separated from the water by the light created on the first day. They rose upwards forming the firmament: the atmosphere, the mists and the clouds...And this law has no link with the Cosmos, for it was invoked after the first Creation.</i> <br>Malbim also offers an alternative interpretation of these two verses, according to which the 'shades' are not instruments of divine punishment through which the Cosmos could be side-stepped, but are the dead and buried.. This interpretation gives the translation: <b>Can the buried dead be resurrected from beneath the waters and their abodes?

                    "Overwhelmed by the power of his arguments, Job’s three companions were left wordless at the end of his oration.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It had not occurred to any of them that Job was undergoing a trial. Each had tried to justify God at the expense of Job's innocence or integrity. Eliphaz had accused him of sinning openly; Zophar, of having sinned secretly; Bildad, of not being all he seemed. But Job had remained steadfast under all their attacks. They had now exhausted all their arguments.</i> However, <i>at this point a brave warrior (1Samuel 16:18)</i> <i>joins the campaign (1Samuel 17:20)</i>; <i>who speaks with understanding...God being with him</i>. Addressing the debaters present, Elihu <i>turns back the tide of war (Isaiah 28:6)</i>, <i>and displaying his strength (1Samuel 14:48)</i> he reveals the truth concerning these questions. <i>He formulates and scrutinizes them (Job 28:27),</i> <i>with the spirit of God that is upon him (Judges 3:10 et alia);</i> <i>and with the secret of the holy ones (Psalms 89:8)</i> <i>and of the perfect Forms (Job 37:16)</i> <i>in his mind.</i> Until at the conclusion of his speech he discloses <i>God’s secret (Jeremiah 23:18)</i>; what had happened <i>when the Sons of God assembled before the Lord and Satan too had joined them (Job 1:6)</i>, as was related at the beginning of the book. Thus, the conclusion of the debate is to be found in the book’s Prologue. And all of this was known to Elihu <i>from the secret God reveals to those that fear Him</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 25:14. Malbim offers no explanation why, if he was present throughout the debate, Elihu is mentioned neither in the Prologue nor in the Epilogue. This is one of the reasons that modern exegetes have regarded Elihu's speech as a later interpolation and not part of the original text of the Book.</i>",
                    "The book’s author starts by informing us that Elihu had been angered by both sides during the debate:",
                    "•  He had been infuriated by Job for <i>justifying himself rather than God (Job 32:2)</i>. Notwithstanding his conviction that he was a righteous person and that he could find no reason for his suffering, he should not have appraised the truth or otherwise of that which challenges the truth of the entity in question. For the notion that no lack of wisdom, ability or will can be attributed to God, Blessed be He, is of itself a truth, just as it is a truth that God exists. This follows from the philosophical proofs that teach us of the existence of a single impalpable entity who, by its infinite wisdom, ability and will, brought all that exists into being. These proofs also teach that this entity is absolutely perfect, that no shortcoming can be attributed to it and that it governs and exercises its authority with sublime wisdom, will and ability.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Elihu's opinion, as Malbim sees it, Job should never have started the debate. Despite his suffering and his conviction that it was unwarranted, he should not have put the perfection of God or Providence into doubt. A unique God must be perfect. And so, the perfection or otherwise of a unique God is not a subject for debate, despite the apparent contradictions. All the proofs in the world, however convincing they might be, cannot deny His perfection. For He is by definition perfect, and so is His Governance.</i> Despite the fact that experiment and experience (such as Job’s own unwarranted suffering) may prove the opposite, namely, that there is indifference or injustice in His Governance, philosophical proofs transcend the evidence of sense-perception and conjecture.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Echoes of the dictum of the Pythagorean philosopher Parmenides 'that the evidence of our senses is less reliable than the evidence of logical reasoning.' Or perhaps Malbim was aware of the new philosophy of positivism and was voicing his reservations concerning it.</i> For judgments based on sense-perception can sometimes miss the mark, as was shown by the geometer astronomer who demonstrated, by scholarly proofs, that the sun is 170 times larger than the Earth.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Basing himself on Ptolmey's estimate of the diameter of the sun, viz. five and a half times that of the earth's, Pappus of Alexandria calculated that 'the solid magnitude of the sun is very nearly 170 times greater than that of the earth' (Heath p.414). In Maimonides Introduction to the Mishna, the more accurate figure of 1663/8 (51/2 cubed) is given.</i> Just as he refuted the sense evidence that perceives the sun as a single small disc and attempted to explain that sense-perception can err and the reason for its error, so Job should have rejected the apparent truth derived from of his own experience in favor of the universal truth verified by general philosophy.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Once again the influence of Kant on Malbim is apparent. Hume had postulated that all knowledge derives from experience and that this restricted our knowledge of causes: we can only assert that event A habitually precedes event B but not that it causes event B. Kant attempted to rescue science from Hume's critique by arguing that there are universally valid features of knowledge that are not derived from experience. Forms such as space and time through which we our sensory perceptions must be filtered and which are responsible for the deep structure of our knowledge. Thus we possess no truths about the world but only about how we interact with it. (Layzer p.10)</i>",
                    "•  Elihu was also angered by the three companions to the debate. For even though sophistry can prove the opposite, a philosopher should not dismiss the evidence of the senses off-hand. He should seek a middle path by which reasoning can be reconciled with the senses, and by which the truth latent in the nature of intellect corresponds with the truth revealed to the eyes. And, furthermore, they should not have condemned Job who was <i>righteous in all his ways (Psalms 145:17)</i> <i>there being no fault in him. (Psalms 92:16)</i>. ",
                    "Elihu’s speech comprises four separate responses.",
                    "In the first response, Elihu explains his previous silence. He had thought that the foundations of knowledge were sense-perception and experience and so <i>he had hidden amongst the baggage (1Samuel 10:22)</i>, away from the elderly debaters. They had been studying the subject for years, <i>becoming familiar with wisdom and knowledge (Ecclesiastes 1:16)</i> with the passage of time.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If the source of true knowledge is sense-perception and experience, then its acquisition is just a matter of making sufficient observations over a long enough period of time. Accordingly, the older you are the more true knowledge you should have acquired.</i>",
                    "By virtue of the truths inscribed by God onto his mind, truths that are unattainable by empirical investigation or great age, being <i>an inherent faculty of man (Job 32:8)</i>, Elihu considers himself to be God’s attorney;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The literal translation of the Hebrew name Elihu - אליהוא - is 'he is my God'. The name occurs elsewhere referring to other persons: 1Samuel 1:1; 1Chron.12:7.</i> for his wisdom is a subset of God’s wisdom and his soul <i>is a part of the Supreme Being on high (Job 31:2)</i>. And so he informs Job that he will stand in for God and debate on His behalf and that since the divineness in his soul is <i>clothed in flesh (Job 7:5)</i>, just as he [Job] is, its awe and dread should not frighten him and he [Elihu] will be able to present all his arguments without instilling fear or apprehension.",
                    "Elihu asserts that God does not make great demands of man. For example, He does not require that man’s worship of God be commensurate with the magnitude of the One being worshipped, for that would be beyond man’s strength. On the contrary, God makes Himself appear the coequal of man, as though He was no larger or greater than him. For by sharing some of His wisdom and His true knowledge with man, He has raised him up towards God’s own level, so that faith should be certain in his soul like one of the Sons of God. And, similarly, by not wanting to be worshipped or heeded beyond the limits of man’s temporal strength, He has stooped from His Godliness towards man, asking no more than this from him. Furthermore and contrary to Job’s opinion, He does not <i>look for opportunities to catch him out</i>, (Job 33:10) making accusations and punishing him for things that are beyond man’s control or choice. ",
                    "He also shows how unwarranted was his [Job's] complaint that God hides things from mankind, not informing them of their sins; <i>where they had gone astray (Jeremiah 3:21)</i> <i>and for which He punishes their disobedience with a rod (Psalms 89:33)</i>. For He had revealed heavenly information to him previously in dreams and visions. For it is by means of true dreams that <i>He opens men’s ear (Job 33:16)</i>  informing them of their iniquity and what the future holds for them. He also makes this known to them through sickness and affliction, for these are all messages that God sends to man in order <i>to return him from his wicked path, that he might live (Jeremiah 26:3 et alia)</i>. ",
                    "None of the debaters had realized the truth about Job’s suffering, namely, that it was a trial. Accordingly, the only way they could account for his suffering was by attributing some sin or shortcoming to Job himself. But their arguments had not convinced Job, for he was sure that he was without fault and had not sinned, either in public or in private. His three companions had failed to dislodge him from this conviction.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Malbim adds: 'And, as the Philosopher [Aristotle] indicated, it is impossible to debate with a person who denies the premises upon which it is based.'</i>",
                    "In the second response, Elihu raises two issues with Job:",
                    " The first, that <i>he laid the corner-stone (Job 38:6)</i> to prove from the suffering of the righteous that personal jurisdiction is not administered by <i>the righteous Lord (Exodus 9:27)</i>, for He has handed Governance over to the Cosmos. He had based this conviction on the following argument: <br>, Since no injustice or deficiency can be attributed to God, and the undeserved suffering of a righteous person is either unjust or improper, it cannot originate from God but from the ruler He has appointed to govern the world: to rule by the laws of Nature which do not distinguish between righteous and wicked persons. And this does not constitute an injustice, since as a consequence of the natural governance of the becoming and demising world, individuals must perish. Even were the Earth to be wiped out, this would not be an evil on the scale of the existence of the Universe, relative to which the Earth is like a grain of sand, as we explained at length in the introduction to the Fifth Oration.",
                    "In refuting this argument, Elihu makes the following analogy. That this is like trying to exonerate a minister of state who has treated a nobleman, <i>one of his people’s princes (Psalms 113:8)</i>, unfairly, by saying that he did not do it in order to harm this particular nobleman but that this is the way he behaves towards everyone, wronging them all indiscriminately. For they are all <i>like grasshoppers in his eyes (Numbers 12:33)</i>; or like his slaves and possessions, to do with as he sees fit. Is God excused for the injustice done to an individual, to a particular person (to Job himself), by saying that such injustice is ubiquitous; that it is common to all of mankind and all creation, everywhere and at all times? <i>For He made them all like the fish of the sea, <i>like creepy-crawlies that have no ruler (Habbakuk 1:14);</i> handing all of creation into the hands of a cruel angel; a blind ruler <i>with clouded eyes (Numbers 24:3)</i>, <i>who loathes justice (Job 34:17)</i>. Is He excused by asserting that He allowed evil to multiply? For the question still remains: why did He transfer governance to this cruel ruler and why does He not govern Himself, rendering to each according to his deeds? Could it be because He is incapable of doing so, or out of jealousy, greed or evil-heartedness?</i>",
                    "The second issue he deals with is Job’s complaint and suit against God, viz. why does He not punish the wicked immediately and in public. ",
                    "With regard to this, he declares that God <i>has prepared judgments for the arrogant (Proverbs 19:29)</i> and that He knows their deeds; there is no darkness in which they can hide from His retribution. But it is not for man to inquire why they are punished secretly and not by a revealed miracle, nor to teach God how and in what manner to punish them. For in His wisdom, He wants to punish them in secret in order that there be some doubt as to whether the punishment comes from Him, thus leaving room for choice. Furthermore, at times they [the wicked] are themselves the agents of His Providence, <i>the rod of His anger</i>, (Isaiah 10:5) afflicting mankind for its evil deeds. Hence, not only does He not wipe them out, He even endows them with the strength and authority to destroy and exterminate multitudes, until they have carried out His work: <i>to afflict peoples</i> (Psalms 94:10) and prove nations. Then will He smash the rod and the staff of evil will be cut down. And it should suffice us to know that the Holy One Blessed be He <i>is slow to anger, but eventually He collects what is His.</i> <i>And whoever says that the Holy One Blessed be He is one who waives the rules...<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Bereshit Rabbah 67.4.

                    "In the third response Elihu discusses the great question Job had asked (in chapter 24), namely, that there are evil-doers who cause havoc to the world—murderers, pirates and bandits—and why does God not <i>annihilate them from under His heaven (Lamentations 3:66)</i>, thus removing their evil and saving the human race from their ravages? Moreover, since they live <i>like beasts of the forest (Psalms 50:10)</i> away from civilized people, God could wipe them out in the darkness of their dwelling-places without prejudicing free-will. He goes on to consider the general question Job had raised concerning reward and punishment, on the basis of which he had concluded that everything is determined by the Cosmos, even the volitional acts of human beings; and that man’s deeds are predestined. And so, just as mill-stones, rotated by the rush of water, are neither paid wages for grinding the flour nor punished if they crush the skull of someone who gets too close to them, humans too deserve neither reward nor punishment.",
                    "Replying to this, Elihu asserts that Job and his companions had made the mistake of regarding reward or punishment as something distinct from the deed, implying that God behaves like a king who enacts laws for his servants, and instructs man and admonishes him concerning certain acts for His own benefit. For as regards a king’s servants, any work done by them is of benefit to him and any who disobey him cause him harm, and the manner in which he rewards or punishes them has no intrinsic connection to the actual deed.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The king's only concern is for the benefit or otherwise that accrues to him from his servants. There is no inherent link between the nature of the work done and the form of payment. The payment depends just on the value of the work and is made in whatever form is mutually acceptable. However, there is no reciprocity between man and God because there is nothing God needs from man. Where Providence is concerned, the reward or punishment for our deeds is inherent in the deeds themselves.</i>",
                    "But this is all wrong, for God is neither impressed by man’s deeds nor has He any need for his work; nor does his rebelliousness bring about any change in Him. He is like a doctor who prescribes treatment for a patient. Whether the patient listens to what the doctor says or refuses to do so, the reward or punishment is inherent in the very act upon which his health and life, or his sickness and death, depend.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This was the solution put forward by Hasdai Crescas, the 14th century philosopher, theologian and statesman. Hasdai was a severe critic of Maimonides, and his major work Or Adonai is a critique of the Guide of the Perplexed. Hasdai's resolution saves God's omniscience by limiting human freedom and the justice of reward and punishment by asserting that it is inherent in the way things are. Just as death follows from the swallowing of poison, so suffering ensues from wrongdoing. Whether Malbim was familiar with Hasdai's writings at first hand is uncertain. </i> This is the way in which the reward and punishment for human acts is linked with the acts themselves. A man who controls his appetites and instincts will <i>enjoy good health (Psalms 73:4)</i>, whereas he who pursues the pleasures of the flesh will become sick <i>and be sorely chastised (Job 33:19)</i>. <br>Similarly, a commonwealth which endeavors to act properly and humanely, to do justice to the oppressed and to remove evil-doers from the land, will enjoy quiet and security <i>free of any evil threat (1Kings 5:18)</i> or destroyer. But when <i>right and justice are usurped in the state (Ecclesiastes 5:7)</i> murderers and gangsters multiply.",
                    "Providence has provided every living being with a defense against its enemies: either the means to fight them or stratagems to protect against them. For example, some of the birds that God has placed in nature are frail and sing at night to keep each other awake, on guard <i>against their enemies and they that seek their souls (Jeremiah 19:9)</i>. God has likewise ordained the nature of man, that governments and the human race should work together <i>to maintain law and justice in the land (Jeremiah 23:5; 33:15)</i>, ever vigilant in eradicating the terrorists, murderers and others who would ravage society. And in this way, the human race continues to exist. For there are always more good people than bad in society and their strength, when they join together to protect the common weal, is greater than that of the minority who, <i>like beasts of the forest</i>, devour and destroy, steal and murder.

But when evil overcomes good and there is no <i>law and justice</i> (Job 36:17) in the land and the human race becomes fish-like, it is they themselves who have brought this evil upon them.

This popular book had been widely approved by contemporary orthodox rabbis. In order to avoid religious controversy, its author had adopted Tycho Brahe's (1546-1601) model of the universe. In this ingenious amalgam of the Ptolemaic and Copernican models, the sun revolves around the earth whilst all the other planets revolve around the sun. The eclecticism of Brahe's model was perfectly suited to Malbim.</i>"

                    "The ancient belief in the Music of the Spheres, according to which objects moving through space produce sounds whose pitch depends on their speed, is mentioned by Maimonides (Guide II,8). The Pythagoreans (c500 B.C.E) are credited with the discovery that harmonious sounds are emitted by strings whose lengths are simple ratios of whole numbers. An octave is the interval between the notes emitted by strings of similar composition and tension one of which is twice the length of the other; the fifth is that between strings whose lengths are in the ratio two to three. According to Pythagorean astronomy, the speed of a planet increases with its distance from the Earth, and so as they circle in their particular orbits each emits a different sound. However, their distances from the Earth are such that these sounds are in harmony. Adopting this notion for his own purposes, Malbim sees this verse as depicting the way the force of gravity acts between the heavenly bodies:<br>...the strings of this force of attraction and its proportions correlate with the scales of the musical notes. This shows the logical order, relationship and equilibrium that exists between the earth and the other spheres, all of which is indicative of great Wisdom and Providence.<br>The Pythagorean notion of a celestial harmony—the harmonious notes, beyond the reach of mortal ear, emitted by the heavenly bodies in their motions—was revived and advanced by Johannes Kepler (1571-1630). It led him to the law of planetary motion (Kepler's Third Law) that the squares of the periodic times of the planets are in the same ratio as the cubes of their respective mean distances from the sun. He expressed his joy at this discovery in the following paean to God (Kline p.78):<br>The wisdom of the Lord is infinite, so are His glory and His power. Ye heavens, sing His praises. Sun, moon and planets glorify Him in your ineffable language. Celestial harmonies, all ye who comprehend His marvelous works praise Him. And thou, my soul, praise they Creator. It is by Him and in Him that all exists...To Him be praise, honor and glory throughout eternity."

The primeval planet had been formless and void, and totally covered by water. It was as a result of the ordinances God invoked to gather the waters into the seas and the atmosphere that the dry-land appeared. Malbim describes the process as follows: The element water was sandwiched between the element earth below and the element air above.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">(This notion of a series of concentric spheres, each surrounded by another out to the ultimate sphere, is Aristotelian. According to this notion, earth has its natural place at the center of the universe, and water, being the next heaviest element, has its natural place immediately above earth. The comes air, and above them all, fire.)</i> At God's decree, vapor began to rise from the element water up to the firmament which is the atmosphere, where the clouds are. As it says: 'And the spirit of God hovered over the surface of the water' (Genesis 1:2) and this made the water-vapor begin to rise. As a result of this, the element air was separated from the evaporating water and some dry-land began to appear. Afterwards, God ordained that the remaining waters gather and form the seas, thus making more dry-land appear."

                    "God closes the discussion by pointing out that there would be no necessity for Providence if all creatures were equally primitive and weak, and none were exploited by others. How and to what purpose would God impose His Will in a featureless and flat world; what need would there be Him? It is the variance in Nature, its unfairness and indifference to moral and ethical values, that gives Providence its purpose and meaning in the world. If there were no Leviathans on Earth, if nothing ever went wrong, there would be no need for Providence and God would effectively be dead."

                    "The moment has come for the final denouement of this drama: the revelation that Job had really never lost his faith and had emerged from the trial with his integrity intact. He had never really ceased to believe in Providence, free-will, the immortality of the soul or redress in the hereafter. However, knowledge is preferable to blind faith and matters as important as these should not be shrouded by ignorance; they should not be just incomprehensible mysteries. Accordingly, his intention in initiating the symposium had been to find a way of substantiating these fundamental tenets by means of rational investigation and philosophical contemplation; for this purpose, someone had to adopt the position of denying their existence. However, the attempts made by the other debaters to substantiate these tenets were totally unconvincing. Employing God’s own words, Job explains that it was in the light of this that he had called on Him to appear and enlighten his understanding of these matters."

It was because he did not want God's design to remain just a matter of faith, shrouded in mystery and uncertainty, that he had initiated the debate. <br>Responding to God in His own words (Job 38:3), Job explains that just as He had called for answers from Job, so Job had been seeking answers from God. Job's contention had been that rational answers should be given to the great issues raised by ethical monotheism; they should not be just matters of faith. And if man is unable to find these rational answers unaided, God ought to provide them."

Happy is he who grew in Torah and labored in Torah; who gratifies his Maker’s spirit; who grows in repute and departs the world with a good name.
