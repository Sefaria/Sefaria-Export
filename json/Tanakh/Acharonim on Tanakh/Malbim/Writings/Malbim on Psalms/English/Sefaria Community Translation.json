                "[The author] is coming to explain the conditions on account of which a person will be a \"Happy Person.\" There is a difference between a \"Happy Person\" and a \"Successful Person\": \"Success\" applies to worldly matters, [enjoyed] in life in this World; \"Happiness\" is in spiritual matters, [enjoyed] in the World to Come. Now, there are three areas of fulfillment, 1) fulfillment of acquisition, 2) fulfillment of the body, and 3) fulfillment of the soul. Therefore the Psalmist explains that here he is addressing the \"Happiness of Man\" [soleley] the \"Happiness\" that only man can attain, which is afforded by his being [at the level of] Man--not coupled with the \"Happiness\" which is afforded by being a living being (i.e. the fulfillment of acquisition or fulfillment of the body) which can also be found among animals. [In fact] we find various animals that attain their livelihood and sustenance more easily and swiftly then man; as the expression goes, \"there are none more wealthy than a pig.\" There are also animals which can accomplish can accomplish more than man is able to though use of the body, such as the elephant and the lion; and, in regards to the senses, an eagle, hawk through their faculty of sight. This is not the \"Happiness\" unique to a person; rather, [the \"Happiness of Man\"] is the fulfillment of refined character and spiritual qualities which can only be found achieved by man. The Psalmist explains that Man's happiness depends primarily on his being careful not to sin. (2-4) \"WHO DOES NOT WALK IN THE COUNSEL OF THE WICKED...\" There is a difference between \"the wicked\" and \"the sinners\": \"the wicked\" sin intentionally and rebelliously, whether in matters between man and the Omnipresent or in matters between man and his fellow. That is why the Psalmist said, \"the counsel of the wicked,\" because they are the ones who sin with counsel and intentionally whereas in regards to the \"sinners\", it would not be right to say \"counsel\" since they do sin with counsel. The Psalmist adds further- [\"THE \"HAPPY PERSON\"] DOES NOT STAND IN THE PATH OF THE \"SINNERS\" the \"sinners\" are the ones who sin from out of desire alone. Meaning to say that [in addition to not sinning like the \"wicked\"], the \"happy person\" also does not sin on account of their desires either. And not only does he not \"WALK on the path of the sinners\"--continuously sinning out of desire--but he does not even \"STAND on their path\"--even momentarily. The Psalmist adds further- AND IN THE DWELLING PLACE OF THE \"LAZY\" HE DOES NOT DWELL, the \"lazy\" don't act wrongly, but they also don't do good. They only chase after  wind and vapor (nothingness) and mockery, and they don't delve in Torah."

                "כי אם: Withholding from doing bad is not enough, the condition of אושר is that he does good. And not that he does good out of politeness alone, like philosophers who fabricate religions for themselves, but [the condition is that the reason he does good is because] he keeps the Torah of Hashem and its commandments. And he [the author of the psalm] explains that the condition [of אושר] is doing the good because it is good to do so, and because it is a commandment of Hashem, and not because of other facets that he hopes to gain for his work, [like] payment and benefit. In that [latter] case, his desire wouldn't be Hashem's Torah, rather the pleasantness and helpfulness is because he hopes for payment for his work. Therefore, [the author] conditions כי אם בתורת ה' חפצו: Hashem's Torah [must be] his desire. And perfection in this (doing good by carrying out Hashem's Torah and mitzvos) is split into two parts: perfection in study and perfection in action. Perfection in study is called תורת ה', because it teaches the wisdom of Hashem and his ways and his truth, but man won't reach the ultimate takeaway from this aspect, and it's enough to desire it and attempt to grasp it and look deeply into it, but even if he doesn't reach it (comprehend what he's studying to the point of reaching conclusive applicable commandments), he doesn't fear. Perfection in action is תורת האדם, that it teaches that which should be done or that which shouldn't be done, and this is called תורתו, and about this portion [of the Torah] it says, יהגה יומם ולילה, that he should learn it on the condition to do it, [meaning that unlike with the portions of Torah that do not come to command a person in a specific action, and therefore do not need to be learned in a way to extract an action as the application, the portions of Torah that command a person in an action must be learned with the intention to know exactly how to act in accordance with what the Torah commands]."

                "To David...In this psalm it will be explained that Hashgacha results from cleaving to Hashem, and the one who cleaves to Him will have Constant Hashgacha which will protect him from all harm, and therefore the individual could rest assured and not fear from any evil thing, for \"nothing evil befalls a tzadik\", except at the moment he severs the thread of dvekut and turns away from the service of Hashem, as the Moreh Nevuchim expained (3:53). Therefore from the multitude of requests which a man can make, it is fitting that he focus on the single request in which he will find all that he desires; that is [to request] that he cleaves to Hashem constantly. Therefore [David] prays that Hashem assists him in achieving this dvekut and removes all obstacles that prevent this great thing which is the pinnacle of his happiness and his request. ",
                "Hashem is my light ... Yirah is from a known thing, and Pachad is from something unknown. When a man fears from revealed enemies which battle with him it is called Yirah; corresponding to this David says that Hashem is my light and my salvation, from whom shall I have Yirah. Meaning to say, it's conceivable that a man will fear from his enemies 1) lest they come upon him at night while he is unable to see them and protect himself; to this David said \"Hashem is my light\"  2) lest the enemy's might and strength be greater than his [and they overpower him]; to this David said \"Hashem is my salvation\", and therefore from whom shall I have fear? And regarding man fearing his foes that secretly plot evil against him...without him knowing, this is called Pahad. To this David said that \"Hashem is the stronghold of my life\" therefore \"From whom shall I have pahad?\""
