Even though the storm raged on Mount Zion as well nothing there was harmed because the Lord who dwells on this mountain protected it. This storm was for the good of Israel, because at that time the kings of the land joined together and came from Tarshish in ships to conquer the land of Israel. This storm broke their ships and drove their armies into the sea. This psalm is closely related to psalm 46."

The phrase ‘the name of the Lord’ indicates the spread of His name as creator of the world, renewer and controller. This will be declared in Zion because the wise men and the priests reside there, who know the name of the Lord. ‘His praise’ refers to His ways and guidance which are merciful and filled with grace. This will be known even to the masses who reside in Jerusalem, through the whole city."

                "A song of ascents of David – This psalm is speaking the praise of Jerusalem. It describes the nation in its totality as one body made up of different individual limbs and Jerusalem as “a city that was joined together within itself…” (Psalms 122:3) The individual limbs join together to become a whole body which can contain the spirit of life, an intellect and a Godly soul. The House of God is located within her and it is the vessel which prepares the whole body to receive the Divine Presence and the Godly soul. The city itself is like the heart and brain within the body, which prepare it to receive the vital force and the intellect. In light of this it says “I rejoiced when they said to me, ‘Let us go to the house of the Lord,’” because there God dwells and He makes the Divine Presence and Godliness to come to rest in holiness."

                "Request – It has been explained that Jerusalem is that which upholds the connectivity of the wholeness of the body and its unity. Now it goes on to say that just as if asked about the welfare of the personal body one would reply that its peace depends on whether its limbs and powers are connected and in peace with each other, because at the moment one divides between them then death comes, so too if one asks after the peace of Jerusalem the answer is that her peace depends on the tranquility of those who love her. The peace of Jerusalem depends on whether there is inner tranquility between those who love her. This is because the primary essence of Jerusalem is the unity of the nation, and if this is so then if strife and struggle arise between her people and an estrangement of hearts occurs, there will be no peace found for the city. Her primary peace is herself with herself “…like a city that was joined together within itself,” (Psalms 122:3) and not if they are divided. There is a difference between peace and tranquility, because 'peace' indicates an external peace and 'tranquility' an inner tranquility. Thus the psalm says that through Israel having inner tranquility, which is why it calls them her lovers, because there is love between them even if they have no peace from their external enemies, this will bring about the external peace of Jerusalem."

This is like the dew of Hermon which is not intended for the needs of mount Hermon, rather that it descend on the mountains of Zion because there God has commanded the blessing. The primary blessing comes down for the sake of Mount Zion and goes by way of Mount Hermon, because the life which the dew brings to Mount Hermon is not constant life which lasts forever, and is not eternal life. But the life which is on Mount Zion is eternal, everlasting life. Similarly, the abundance of wealth and possessions which came to Zevulun only came to them for the sake of Yissachar, in order that they would have the freedom to occupy themselves with Torah and through them to acquire eternal life. These came to Yissachar through the means of Zevulun, and in this Zevulun was like Mount Hermon which receives the dew for the sake of Mount Zion."

                "Song of ascents – There is within this song a wondrous cornerstone to the foundations of faith. This is that the supernal source, whose waters never fail, is blessed and increased through the actions of those below because the Lord pours out good to the good and abundance to those who are prepared. When the generation is not fit to receive this, then the spring is muddied, the source is ruined and the channels will not pour out their blessings, this is the notion of the blessing with which Israel blesses the Lord. Through their good deeds and prayers the supernal pool is filled, the river of God is filled with the waters of loving kindness, goodness and mercy, and it pours out upon the land. And when their actions are evil the streams of water dry up and the river becomes dry and desolate, as the Sages taught ‘Israel adds strength to the power above.’ Blessing is for the sake of the One above, as is written in the book The Lands of the Living (in the Land of Yehudah, 5) in explanation of the word ‘blessed’ with many proofs. This is what is written “Behold, bless the Lord,” that is to say – give Him blessing, exiles above and exiles below, through your good deeds. You “all servants of the Lord who stand in the house of the Lord at night,” like faithful servants who labor day and night and never leave their post for a moment, bless the Lord and give might unto God."

                "May the Lord bless you – It is explaining in what way you bless the Lord. That is, that you give Him strength and might in order that He be able to bless you, because this depends on your actions. You should bless Him, that is - fill Him with blessing in order that He can pour it out on you. What does ‘May the Lord bless you from Zion’ mean? That your blessing will not come from the structure and orders of the workings of the heavens, but rather from Zion. It will come through the delicate vapors and the drops of dew which rise up from below, from the acts of Zion and their service. From ‘He Who made heaven and earth,’ which is the blessing that does not derive from the heavens or the earth, but rather from the Lord above who made them both and pours out miraculous, providential blessing upon them."
