                "A happy heart will have a good face, the joy of the heart and his sadness will be in several ways, and here the happy heart speaks in the affairs of the world, as a happy heart of all my labors, The joy of the heart is evident on the face, but will not benefit the spirit, that the spirit includes for all the inner powers of the soul a spirit of wisdom and understanding a spirit of knowledge and reverence of God, and sometimes the heart is happy and the spirit mourns, (Good) An afflicted spirit, by being saddened by his mental status, his spirit will be exalted and exalted above, and this is better than a benevolent face,\n"
