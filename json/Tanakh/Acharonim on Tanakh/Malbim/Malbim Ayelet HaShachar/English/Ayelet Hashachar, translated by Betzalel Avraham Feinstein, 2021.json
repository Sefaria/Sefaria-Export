And after investigation, I found that in several places where the direct object is known through for instance a definite article ה or a pronoun, and moreover in a place where the direct object is a noun – the word את will usually come. And in a place where the direct object is unknown – it usually will come without the word את, and when the word את does come, there will be a homiletical interpretation.",
            "And moreover, in a place where the direct object is known but is missing the word את, there will be a homiletical interpretation. And it will always say יכבס בגדיו (he shall wash his clothes), except with a house which is afflicted, where it will say יכבס את בגדיו. This is because whenever one washes clothes, the clothes were not necessarily worn, only afflicted, so the pronoun in בגדיו is not precise; thus, it will be missing the word את. But a house that is afflicted only makes the clothes that were worn unclean, so the the pronoun will be precise; thus, it is written את."

            "And in a place where it is proper for the word את or any preposition to be but it is missing, there will be an explanation, as is desired. And thus, when it is written three times וסמך ידו (and he shall lay his hand) without the word את, the sages give three homiletical interpretations, as if it were written וסמך בידו. And the same applies for all situations like this.<br><br><i>There are three places in the Torah where it is written וסמך ידו without the word </i>את:<br><br><i>Leviticus 1:4 – </i>וסמך ידו על ראש העלה ונרצה לו לכפר עליו<i> (And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the burnt-offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him).</i><br><br><i>Leviticus 3:2 – </i>וסמך ידו על ראש קרבנו ושחטו פתח אהל מועד וזרקו בני אהרן הכהנים את הדם על המזבח סביב<i> (And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it at the door of the tent of meeting; and Aaron's sons the priests shall dash the blood against the altar round about).</i><br><br><i>Leviticus 4:24 – </i>וסמך ידו על ראש השעיר ושחט אתו במקום אשר ישחט את העלה לפני יהוה חטאת הוא<i> (And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt-offering before the LORD; it is a sin-offering).</i><br><br><i>In each of these cases, it means to lay his own hand and to not do it through an intermediary<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">789</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Vayikra 28.</i>.</i>"
