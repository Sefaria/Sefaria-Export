                "He will gather the outcasts of Israel – There is a difference between collect (asaf) and to gather (kanas). Gathering is into a guarded place (as in Ezekiel 22:21) and in truth the ingathering and collection of the exiles will be before the rebuilding of Jerusalem as is written in many places (and in truth the Sages were divided over this.) Only after Jerusalem is rebuilt will they be gathered into a place with walls, a walled city with doors and locks - that is what ‘gather’ means."
