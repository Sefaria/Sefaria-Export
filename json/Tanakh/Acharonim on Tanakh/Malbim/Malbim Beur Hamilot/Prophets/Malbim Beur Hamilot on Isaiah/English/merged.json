                "“for your light has come” The commentators were astounded by this usage because they thought when speaking of the sunrise, the Hebrew language employs the terms ‘rising’ or ‘going out’ while ‘coming’ implies sunset in all cases. But they did not check this matter well, because this is true only in reference to the body of the sun, when the speaker describes it as coming out from its place beyond the eastern horizon and heading toward its destination at the western. Then its 'coming’ is the moment it reaches  its destination in the west. This is not so when speaking of the light, whose purpose is achieved when its rays touch that which is illuminated, then it has come to its place. “Your light” refers to the light which comes of itself, and the rising of the glory of Gd is the light of prophecy - they will shine upon you until they are as the light of the sun upon the moon, as I wrote elsewhere (see Isaiah 60:19). On this it says “…and kings by the brilliance of Your shine,” (Isaiah 60:3) because ‘shine’ refers to the light of the moon as I mentioned above (verses 13 and 14, and 19 below)."
