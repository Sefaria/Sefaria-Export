                "<b>words of jeremiah.</b> The first three pesukim bring out the boundaries of the essence of the book in all its details, because all books are limited. They are limited in terms of its form and what it talks about. For example if it a book of rebuke or a poem or a work of knowledge or the like, or if it was said in a riddle form or a story or the like, and on this it says, <b>Divrei</b> the words, to show that it (sefer Yirmiyahu) includes many types of things. In it you can find Visions, nevuas, stories, rebuke, and the like. The second way a book is limited is from the standpoint of the author who said what is in the book. <b>Yirmiyahu ben Chilkiyahu</b> he wrote sefer yirmiyahu and he was a navi who was special that his father was the kohen gadol and navi. And he was also rich. <b>He</b> (Yirmiyahu) <b>was from the kohanim who were in Anatot</b> (name of a town). They (the kohanim in Anatot) were special in their fear of Hashem. Yirmiyahu was from <b>Eretz Binyamin</b>, not from the people who lived in Yerushaliayim. The person who rebukes who is from a different city, the people he is talking to won't recognize him and he wont hold back from giving them rebuke because of his love of the city, and his words will be heard better. Where does he (Yirmiyahu) draw his words from, is it from his mind, or his studies, or from books? it says <b>That is the words of Hashem to him</b>, that he (Yirmiyahu) drew his words from the source of living water (a reference to Hashem's words). From the standpoint of the time that he gave nevuah, it says that he had nevuah in three changing time periods that the stance of the nation and kings were changing (in terms of following Hashem or not). Because he started nevuah <b>during the time Yoshiyahu ben Amon</b>, that he and his generation were tzadikim, and he started to have nevuah <b>in the thirteenth year of his kingship</b> (yoshiyahu's kingship), that when he (yirmiyahu) was mature he started serving Hashem. "

                "And he continued his nevuah <b>IN the days of Yehoyakim</b>, during which the generation were tzadikim and the king was a rasha <b>Until the end of the eleventh year of Tzidkiyahu,</b> during which the nation changed to reshaim and the king was good. And It is telling us that these nevuot (the nevuahs of yirmiyahu) were constant during this whole time. <b>Until the galut of yerushalayim</b>, because all of the nevuahs were fulfilled. "

                "<b>I cannot speak, for I am a child.</b> This was for three reasons: 1. That the child (Jeremiah) did not have confidence in himself in front of greater people, 2. That the child did not know how to order his words in the correct way (meaning he did not know how to speak well in front of the congregation), and 3. That maybe the nation will become angry with what he says and come upon him and kill him. "

                "A dear son...God responds to them that there is a difference between someone from the first generations whom God was able to bring back [to God's ways] by showing them godliness, might and wonders, versus now, and there is a difference between a dear son and a little tyke. A little tyke is a small boy who, even if he sins, his father still loves him because he is a little boy and he plays with him. A dear son is a grown man who has many virtues and is dear to because of those virtues, and even if he sins, his father still loves him because he'll remember his virtues and be dear to him. So too, in Egypt, when Israel had no virtue or wholeness, they were like a little tyke in God's eyes, as it is written \"when Israel was a youth I loved him.\" When they were in the wilderness and in the Land of Israel in the early years, they were like a dear son, because they had among them prophets, holy ministers and sages, and then if they sinned, God remembered the righteous among them and forgave their sin. But now \"Ephraim is a dear son to me\" - behold he has no dearness or importance, and so too \"he is a little tyke\" -- behold he is not a boy but he has already reached old age, and the parallel statements \"Ephraim is a dear son to me...whenever I have turned on him, I remember him even more (every utterance that has the letter bet after it is a reproach) that so too whenever I speak any defamation \"I will surely remember\" his virtues because he is dear. \"he is a little tyke...that is why my heart yearns for him\" that my heart will yearn on account of him and \"I will surely have mercy\" because he is a small boy, I will play with him, and and if so, how can you ask that I do something miraculous and love you as in the days of old?"
