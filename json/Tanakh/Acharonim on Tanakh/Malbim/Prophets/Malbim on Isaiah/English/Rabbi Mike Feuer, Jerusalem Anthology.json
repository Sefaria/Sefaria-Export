                "<b>Zion</b> – This begins a new section now that the prophet has finished the prophecy which he spoke about Yehudah and Jerusalem from the beginning of the book until now. If you look carefully you will see that the rebuke which he delivered from the beginning of the book until the twenty first verse, which is the prophecy that particularly concerns Yehudah, was about acts between the people and Gd – sacrifices, repentance and prayer. Then most of the rebuke which he gives from the verse “How has she become a harlot…” (Isaiah 1:21) is dealing with matters between people like forgery, fraud and the perversion of justice. This is because sins against Gd were more common among the people of Yehudah who lived outside of Jerusalem, but in the capitol city of Jerusalem sins between people were more common because of the amount of business and trade done there. Now the seer closed his words by saying that each one will find his reparation through the sin he himself committed, and by fixing his crookedness he will return to his place. ",
                "<b>Zion</b> – The capitol city which sinned through perverting justice. <b>Shall be redeemed through justice</b> – the moment you repent and do justice, you will be saved and redeemed. ",
                "<b>And her penitent through righteousness</b> – This is referring to the tribe of Yehudah who returned to Zion from the exile, whose sin was in perverting righteousness between man and Gd. <b>They will be redeemed through righteousness</b> – by showing the righteousness of their actions before their Maker and Creator."

In response to this it says that in that time these reasons will be nullified, because he will judge and rebuke in the matters that cause conflict between nations, and rebuke will be sufficient to stop many peoples from transgressing the law. Then, since they no longer need to wage war, perforce the will ‘beat their swords into plowshares’ and no more learn the ways of war:"

                "O herald of Zion – The verse describes it as if Zion herself will be the herald, and so too Jerusalem. It says ‘you, Zion the herald, go up onto a high mountain and you Jerusalem the herald lift up your voice with strength, don’t be afraid that what you herald will not come to be because of course it will come.’ Not only this, but you should also say to the cities of Yehudah ‘behold your Gd’ as if you were pointing with your finger at a thing which has already come to be. (I have already explained in many places that Zion was where the king and the Sanhedrin dwelled and the place of the Sanctuary, while Jerusalem was the dwelling place of the masses. Zion will announce that the Divine Presence has returned to Zion, as well as the kingship and the priesthood. This is why the prophet told it to go up on the high mountain. Jerusalem will announce the ingathering of the exiles, therefore the prophet told her to lift up her voice with strength in order that the ones driven away hear and gather from the four corners of the heavens.)"
