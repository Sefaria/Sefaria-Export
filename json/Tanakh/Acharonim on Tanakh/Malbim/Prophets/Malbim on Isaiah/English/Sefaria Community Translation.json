                "Strength. To God, there are things such as strength and might. (Amitz refers to the consistency of strength without a sign of stopping. The speaker attributes strength like a hailstorm, and might like a storm of torrential rain) Strength like a hailstorm, this is [what is meant by] breaks cedars, and destructive tempest is a storm-wind that presses and cuts everything in its place, and if combined with the hail that flows in the strong wind, then it can uproot everything. Storm of torrential rain overflowing, for the hail destroys but does not flood anything in its place, but if water comes and flows afterward, then everything overflows and everything that the hail destroyed is lifted to a far place, and the hail is likened to the killing and destruction that the Assyrians did in their land, and the storm is likened to God who exiled the remenant to the Gozen river and the cities of Media. Cast, the hailstorm and overflowing rain, casts first the crown of pride to the land by hand [forcefully], and after that."

                ".A voice rings out. He describes that he hears a voice that rings out, because the prophet sees this as if it already happened, and describes in contrast how at the time where the ringing is quiet for a moment, he heard a voice saying \"Proclaim!\" (Verse 6), like hurry up and do not wait a minute, as will be explained there.

                "In the desert. The many wonders that were done for our forefathers when they left Egypt in the deserted wilderness, will now wander before the prophet in his Divine Inspiration, visualizing in his Inspiration that the path that G-d led them then, which was a way of miracles and intervention, were prepared for and also guarded the sons of their sons to pass through a second time at the time of the final redemption, like it says \"I will show him wondrous deeds as in the days when you sallied forth from the land of Egypt. (Micah 7:15)\", but in addition God will continue to reveal his strong hand also in a new course that was never done in the world, and He will work miracles and work wonders that were not created from older times. And there is a difference between \"desert\" and \"wilderness\", that just like in a settled land places of gardens and orchards were found, so too in a desert there are places of dryland and dugouts found which grow thorns and thistles, and this is called \"wilderness\". And there is a difference between \"Clear a road\" and \"Level in the wilderness\", that \"Clear a road\" is a road that that was already around, and the obstacle stones have been removed, but \"Level in the wilderness\" means that they should pave and raise a new path that was not already around, and there is a difference between \"Lord\" and \"our God\", like I explained in many places that the name \"Lord\" is called from the side that He is the Creator of the world and constantly renews it, and the name \"God\" particularly the name \"our\" (נו) teaches the attachment He has with the Israelites and the Divine Intervention that He sets apart for them to work wonders and work splendors. So it says here in the \"desert\" where the Israelites traveled when they left Egypt, and there is where the path of God already was from the pervious miracles, clear the road from obstacle stones, because now this road will be renewed and the miracles will be revealed a second time, however in the wilderness which is wilder than the desert, and the Israelites did not travel there, there they need a new highway that never existed, and this highway will be to our God, special to us in his wondrous love for us, and he will add miracles and signs and wonders that were never before revealed. \n"

Although it will be said that it will not be like the normal actions of the world that at the time that they want to straighten the way and a mountain and a hill and a valley is found in front of it, that then the mountain soil will travel into the valley, until the mountain is lowered and the valley is raised, in a way that according to nature a mountain and a hill will first be forced to be lowered, and because of this the valley will be filled. But if it will be that it is not by the way of nature, it will start out \"Let every be raised,\" from itself, and afterwards, \"Every hill and mountain be made low\"....",

Here is the way they would want to straighten the rugged ground, that the path is curved because there are many small rigid hills that they need to go around, so surely they will have to start by putting the ridges into a plain, and then the rugged ground will become level from itself. But if it will be not by the way of nature, let first the \"Rugged ground\" become level before the ridges go away, and afterwards, \"And the ridges will become a plain\"."

It says - you Zion the herald go up on a high mountain and you Jerusalem raise your voice with strength, don't be afraid lest the thing which you announce not come to pass, because it certainly will come. Not only this but also say to the cities of Yehudah 'here is your Gd' as if you are pointing to something which has already come and exists. (I already explained in many places that in Zion was the seat of the king, the Sanhedrin and the place of the Holy Temple, while in Jerusalem dwelt the masses. Zion announces that He has returned His Presence to Zion and the kingship and the priesthood. Therefore the prophet advised him to ascend a high mountain. Jerusalem announces the ingathering of the exiles, therefore the prophet advised her to raise her voice in strength in order that those driven away hear and be gathered from the four corners of the heavens."

                "\"Poor one.\" After the prophet already prophesied that the barren one would have many children, which is an allegory for the ingathering of the exiles, he describes that at that time Zion will still not be rebuilt on her hill. This poor one, who is Zion, will still storm in the rage of her spirit because she still is not comforted. (This was similarly expressed above in chapter 49, \"Behold, these shall come from afar... -- And Zion will say, the Lord has abandoned me...\" which is similarly expressing that at the time of the ingathering, Zion would yet sit in ruins, as I explained there.) He is saying: 'the barren woman' is already filled with joy, because 'many are the children of the desolate'; but the 'poor one' is still 'storming, still 'not comforted,' i.e., the land is filled with people returned from the exile, yet Zion is still not built. God replies to her: \"Behold, I set your floor-stones with puch\" -- the stones on which the foundation rests will be Nofech-stones, and the foundation itself will be of Sapir-stones."
