                "HE NAMED HIM NOACH, SAYING \"THIS ONE WILL CONSOLE US\" - I have explained in my commentary on Isaiah that the sense of the verb N-CH-M is the change of attitude; this is consistent with the idea of consoling mourners, as the mourner’s attitude changes from grief to happiness; this is also consistent with the idea of regret, as it says here, this “one will make us regret” – from now on we will refrain from our useless activities that have no positive effect for the benefit of humankind, and thereby, we will also find rest from our evil and the land which is cursed as the result of our evil ways. Similarly, it is written in Haggai, “you have sown much and reaped little – be mindful of the way that you have been behaving” and as I explained there. By way of regretting ones evil ways, and resolving to change them, the curse will also be changed to a blessing and there will be relief, as in Isaiah 13, “on the day when God will relieve you from your sadness, your anger, and your toil.”"

                "Any creeping thing that lives will be for you to eat. For in the day of Adam, people's bodies were strong and the fruits had not yet been damaged and they could sustain a person like meat could. But, after the deluge, when food was damaged, and man was to be scattered to the edges of the land and far off isles for at that point hot and cold (weather) were introduced, so meat was needed for the maintenance of his health. Also, after they all lived through the actions of Noah who provided for them in the ark, they were like his acquisitions and in his possession. Also, because man originally wasn't on the level of \"speaker\" - only of \"living\" so only \"growing\" things were permitted to him. There was no difference between him and animals except that animals were given green vegetation to eat and man was given vegetation that produce seed, meaning fruit. Now, man was elevated to the level of \"speaker.\" Just as there is no wrongdoing in the \"living\" consuming the \"growing\" for it is elevated in this manner as it become part of the body of the \"living\"thing, so too there is no wrongdoing if a \"speaker\" eats something \"living\" and it is elevated to become part of the body of the \"speaker. This is what is meant by \"like the green vegetation, I have given you all.\" Meaning: just as I prepared food for the animals to eat of the green vegetation [as is written: \"and to all the animals of the field, all green vegetation for eating] because it elevates it to the level of \"living,\" so too I have given you all, that you should eat all seed producing vegetation since you are also \"living\" beings and you should eat animals since you are \"living speakers\" and anything more lowly is fit to be the sustenance of that which is greater than it."

                "<b>Questions:</b> The repetition of, \"And the Lord took account of, etc. and the Lord did etc.\" (Genesis 21:1). The question of the Ran, that he named him on the day of his birth and not on the day of his circumcision. That which is written (Genesis 21:5), \"And Avraham was one hundred years old,\" is extra; as we already knew this from that which it stated a year before [Yitzchak] was born, after the circumcision of Avraham, that he was ninety-nine years old! That which is written (Genesis 21:7), \"Who would have declared to Avraham, that Sarah will nurse children\" - what did it want with this?",
                "<b>And the Lord took account of Sarah:</b> I have already explained in Ayelet HaShachar that when the noun precedes the verb, it indicates that the thing was earlier than this. So [here] it means to say that still before Avimelekh took her, she was already pregnant from Avraham. And that is according to the opinion of Rabbi Chama in the Midrash that she gave birth in seven truncated months. For that is why, at the time Avimelekh took her, her fetus was not noticeable. But if she gave birth in nine months, they would say that she became pregnant from Avimelekh and that she gave birth in seven truncated months. But the opinion that says she gave birth in nine month reasons that God took account of Sarah after the story with Avimelekh, and that the story with Avimelekh was ten or eleven months before her giving birth. So they would have known  [this way] also that she did not get pregnant from Avimelekh. And that which the noun comes before the verb (making it past perfect) is to teach the connection of the deed [that was mentioned before it]: That by way of his praying for Avimelekh, the Lord took account of Sarah - like the matter that they said (Bava Kamma 92a), \"Whoever prays for his fellow, when he himself also is in need of that very thing, will be answered first.\" <b>And the Lord took account:</b> There is a distinction between saying (<i>amirah</i>) and speaking (<i>dibbur</i>), as I wrote at length in the book, HaTorah VeHaMitzvah (Leviticus 3). As speech also signifies the explanation of the things. And there is a distinction between remembered (<i>zakhar</i>) and took account of (<i>pakad</i>). As taking account of, is always to do some thing for [the other]. So first God said, in Parashat Lech [Lecha] (Genesis 17:19), \"Indeed, your wife Sarah will bear you a son.\" And that is called saying. But it was [only] fulfilled when He took account of her to have her conceive. And afterwards (Genesis 18:14), He spoke and explained through an angel and limited \"the time that I will return to you,\" that it would be on Pesach of the next year. And about this it stated, \"and the Lord did to Sarah as He had spoken.\""

'At the set time I will return to you' (Genesis 18:14). 'And I have done' - as it is written, 'and the Lord did to Sarah as He had spoken.'\" And it comes out like Rabbi Yehudah [Rabbi Nechemiah] (Bereshit Rabbah 53:5): \"'And the Lord took account of Sarah as He had said' - that which He had said in an utterance. 'And the Lord did to Sarah as He had spoken' - that which He had spoken to her though an angel.\""

So Avraham implemented, \"And he called his son's name,\" immediately; and he circumcised, \"when he was eight days old\" (Genesis 21:4). And about both of them, it stated, \"as the Lord had commanded him.\" And it stated, \"that was born to him, to which Sarah had borne to him\" - as it was written, \"your wife Sarah will bear you a son\" - that is to say, a son who will be the heart and treasure that will be descended from you.

And afterwards when Sarah heard of the announcement, she also laughed with joy, as she went back to her youthfulness and would bear a child in the natural way; whereas Avraham would remain in his old age and require a miracle - as I wrote in  my commentary there. According to this, it can be said that that which Avraham called the name of this son Yitzchak was because \"Avraham was one hundred years old when his son Yitzchak was born to him.\" As he laughed and rejoiced about this - \"can a hundred year old man have children?\" And he was commanded to call him Yitzchak based on this. But about this, Sarah said (Genesis 21:6) that \"God made for me\" the main laughter and miracle - he made a greater miracle for me, to the point \"that anyone who hears,\" will not laugh about the miracle of Avraham. Rather he \"will laugh for me,\" about the miracle that was done for me.
