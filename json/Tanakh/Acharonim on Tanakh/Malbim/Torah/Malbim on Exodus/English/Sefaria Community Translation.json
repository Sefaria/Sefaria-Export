                "<b>And the king of Egypt said:</b> According to the straightforward understanding, he spoke to Egyptian women who were <b>delivering the Jewish women.</b> And there were two types of midwives: 1) One who would deal with the one sitting on the travailing chair, to deliver the newborn; and the second to deal with the newborn, to cut his umbilical cord and to take care of his needs. <b>One was called Shifrah and the second was called Puah.</b>. And the understanding is not that there were only two midwives; for behold they were a large people. So it only means that there were two types of midwives. Or it is like Rabbi Avraham Ibn Ezra, that two women were the ministers over all of them; and likewise did Rabbi Yitzchak Abarbanel explain. And that which it states, \"And the king of Egypt said,\" and it does not explain what he said, is understood as referring to what is above, when it stated at the beginning (Exodus 1:9), \"And he said to his people, 'Look, the Israelite people are more and stronger.'\" So he now said this to the midwives and also took counsel with them about what to do, lest they multiply. And after he presented his concern and his worry, then..."

                "<b>Questions:</b><br> Why did it ennumerate all these deeds when there was no need? And why was it specific that \"he went out to his kin... [he saw an Egyptian] striking... one of his kin...\" (Shemot 2:11)? Why did he get involved in a dispute of the shepherds when they had a clear fix, i.e., not to water their flocks until all the herds were gathered, like the shepherds of Charan?",
                "<b>And he turned</b> (Shemot 2:12), tells us that he was driven on by a Divine spirit (c.f. Yeshayahu 59:19) to break the arm of the wicked one and to release those destined for death. And so that you shouldn't say that he did this without consulting his reason, only from sudden anger, which is not praiseworthy - regarding this I say, that he <b>\"turned this way and that to see if there was anyone around\"</b> (Shemot 2:12) - for he did it premeditatedly and with consulting his reason. For he knew it was a dangerous thing to do if anyone knew, and so he killed him - to save the life of his kinsman. And the opinion of our sages of blessed memory in Sanhedrin 58b is that the Mitzri was liable for the death penalty, as an Egyptian who strikes a Jew is liable for the death penalty. And the Rambam in Hilchot Melachim 10:6 is of the opinion that [the Mitzri] is only liable at the hands of heaven. And regarding this the Midrash says that he consulted with the heavenly entourage. <b>\"And he saw that there was no man around\"</b> (Shemot 2:12) - but angels he saw, and he consulted with them. And by means of allusion, that he saw himself - that he himself was no man, only joined to the angels. And he struck him with the spiritual power that was within him, and regarding this our sages of blessed memory said that he struck him with the Explicit Name. (Shemot Rabbah 1:30)"

                "<b>And God saw that he had turned to see</b> since the level of 'through a glass, darkly' which he had prophesied at up until now needed no preparation. And the vision he saw now was allegorical and by means of a riddle, and from the midst of the strength of this metaphor, his soul didn't need to extend out from his body. For his bodily powers hadn't failed, at this moment - for he was prepared in his nature, from his fathers, for this prophecy. But after he turned to look, and the soul extended out of his body - for then he grasped at the level of 'an illuminated glass', and through this it may be that, since he turned to see, through an illuminated glass - \"no human may see Me and live\" (Shemot 33:20). And for this reason <b>\"God called to him... and said Moshe, Moshe\"</b> (Shemot 3:4). Our sages of blessed memory have already explained that every \"saying\" is preceded by a \"calling\", and it's said in Sifra 61:3/section 3 that Moshe Moshe, Avraham Avraham, etc., are the language of affection and encouragement. Another take: he was Moshe before he had spoken with Them, he is Moshe now that he has spoken with Them. And I explained there that in the beginning They said her name, that They doubled the calling, did it twice - the calling itself teaches of encouragement, and the doubling of the calling teaches of affection. And again it gives a reason for the distinction between calling Moshe Moshe - for no separating trope note had come between the ruler of the names [?] and Avraham. And so with every two names that come next to each other - there's always a separating trope note between them.  Regarding this I say an alternative: he was Moshe before he spoke with Them, etc - means to say, for all the prophets who were unprepared in their natures for prophecy needed one calling to awaken their material selves and to prepare them for the extending of the soul out of them, and the second calling was to the weak houses of the soul. And for this reason there is a separating trope note for them. But for Moshe, whose materiality was already prepared for this extending in its nature, didn't tremple or quake from it, and so there's no separating trope mark between them, for the callings had begun immediately to the innermost soul. And regarding this it is said in the Midrash that God stopped [הפסיק, same word as separating trope mark] speaking to all the prophets, but to Moshe he didn't stop. It means to say that Moshe always stood ready for the Word with no break, and this is why God said to him, Moshe Moshe, to awaken hem in this because he was prepared by means of his nature. And Moshe said \"Here I am\", meaning to say he was ready and prepared for the Divine Word."

                "<b>And each man cast down his staff</b> This relates to the sages and magicians, that they cast down their staffs. <b>And they became serpents</b>, this relates to <b>the sorcerers of Mitzrayim</b>, that they became serpents at the moment that the sages and magicians cast down their staffs. They were wrapped in serpentskin and it seemed that it was because of the staffs that they became serpents, <b>and Aharon's staff swallowed up their staffs</b>. Regarding this, the Midrash (Shemot Rabbah 9:7) relates that \"the Holy Blessed One said: If the serpent swallows their serpents, that would be the ordinary way of their world, that serpent swallows serpent. Rather, it should return to its form and then swallow their serpents. What is <b>and Aharon's staff swallowed their staffs</b>? Rabbi Elazar says, a miracle within a miracle: it teaches that Aharon's staff returned to its form and swallowed them. When Par'oh saw this, he was surprised and said, what if the staff swallows Paroh and his throne? Now it will swallow him!\" Here ends the Midrash quotation. And what is written, What is <b>and Aharon's staff swallowed their serpents</b>, has no explanation, for it has already explained that it returned to being a staff and then swallowed it - so what's the novelty of Rabbi Elazar? It seems that in the beginning it explains what is written, <b>and Aharon's staff swallowed</b>, that it returned to staffhood and after that swallowed. Regarding this it is asked, What is <b>and Aharon's staff swallowed their serpents</b>? Meaning to say that it should have said, and Aharon's staff swallowed <i>their serpents</i>, for their serpents didn't return to their original form! Regarding this Rabbi Elazar says it's a miracle within a miracle, for after Aharon's staff returned to be a staff as its original form was, <b>it swallowed them</b>, meaning to say, it swallowed <i>the sorcerers themselves</i>! For since the sorcerers were serpents wrapped in serpentskin, and they with the staffs were concealed below the skin, the staff of Aharon swallowed the \"serpents\" with the sorcerers and staffs concealed beneath them. And if it had said, and Aharon's staff swallowed their serpents, I would have thought that only the serpents' bodies were swallowed and not the sorcerers. But since it said that it swallowed their staffs, that they were concealed below the serpents, from this we know that they were swallowed with the sorcerers. And regarding this it's said that Paroh said that it was capable of swallowing him and his throne just as it swallowed the sorcerers. <b>And Paroh's heart was hardened</b>, that he was also visibly scared to be swallowed alive as the sorcerers had been swallowed - and with all this, he [still] hardened his heart!"

Par'oh and all ancient idol worshippers thought that there was a force of good and a force of evil, and would serve the force of good in order that it would do good for them, and serve the force of evil to appease it so that it would not do evil to them, and their service would be different. For the force of good they wouldn't slaughter animals, for it didn't want blood and the murder of flock and herd. It was only that they came before it with their wives and children and infants, to celebrate with drum and tambourine, as it desired good and joy. And for the force of evil they served it with slaughter and sacrifice, to appease its anger with blood. Infants and children would not come, lest it injure them with its evil or wish that they be slaughtered on its alter, for it desired human sacrifice. And regarding this Par'oh asked, <b>who will go</b> - for if their service was to the good force, infants and women also went, but they wouldn't take herds and flocks, and if they served the evil entity the herds and flocks would go and not the women and infants."

                "\"And Jethro rejoiced\".  The verse is saying the happiness of Jethro was because of the goodness to the Jews, and not because of the bad done to the Egyptians.  It is based on this idea that the Sages say (quoted by Rashi) that 'his flesh became fulled with prickles, [presumably there is a distinction between Chedva and other languages that also depict happiness.  Chedva paints a specific type of inner, spiritual happiness that overpowers an external sadness.  This nuanced definition of Chedva is evident in the verse from Nechamia (8:10) \"Do not be sad for the Chedva of Hashem is your strength\"."

                "<b>And you shall make sacred garments:</b> Behold, the garments that He commanded to make were ostensibly outer garments, such that their makeup is discussed - how the craftsmen are to make them with their work. But they really indicate inner clothes that the priests of God should make - to clothe their souls with thoughts and traits and proper tendencies, which are the clothes of the soul; and the craftsmen did not make those garments. But God commanded Moses that he should make these sacred garments - meaning to teach them how to refine their souls and traits, in such a way they will wear majesty and splendor upon their internal souls. And the explanation of \"And you shall make sacred garments for glory,\" is that it is understood by us that every place that the soul of a man is called glory (as in Psalms 30:13, \"In order that my glory sings\"), you shall make sacred garments for the glory - meaning the soul - and I have already explained in my commentary to in Isiah (Chapter 5) that there is a distinction between glory and beauty, for a man is glorified also by his natural traits but is beautified only be his traits of volition.  Corresponding to the spirituality within the soul naturally sourced in its depths is called glory, and corresponding to the light and splendor which one merits through divine service and its holiness is called beauty.  And these two levels clothe in the holy garments that Moshe made, which is to say that he [Moshe] taught and aided them to merit to be garbed in precious garments and splendor and through this they \"made holy garments\" for the soul - which is called glory - and the soul - which is called beauty.  ",
                "Hints within the holy garments",
                "We have already said that just like the external body is clothed, which is like clothing for the soul and it's external clothing, so too one should clothe the inner soul with it's internal garments and become enriched by them.   And just like we call external clothing with the word \"measure\" (מד), for they are made to the specific measurements of each person, so too the garments of the soul are called \"measurements\" (מדות), for the attributes (מדות) of a person and his qualities garb the soul, and through them [one's traits] it's [the soul's] powers and greatness will be expressed.  And when [Moshe is] commanded on the external garments of the priests, the essence of the intention was to teach them knowledge of how to dress their souls again in the attributes and qualities of purity and holiness.  And Chazal say:  The tunic [ketonet] atones for bloodshed,  The trousers atone for forbidden sexual relations, the mitre atones for the arrogant, the belt atones for thought of the heart, the breastplate of the High Priest atones for improper judgments, the ephod of the High Priest atones for idol worship, the robe of the High Priest atones for malicious speech, the frontplate of the High Priest atones for an act of brazenness'.  And we will explain them in what seems a clarifying light these garments of the soul in the order of their donning.  Behold the first garments are the ones through which the soul being an animalistic soul are covered, i.e. the power of lustful and of anger, and so come the trousers train and to clothe (immature) people to stop the lustful force to cover one's sexual organs, and the tunic which is an undergarment will remind him to squelch the power of anger, from which comes bloodshed.  And a hint to this is (the verse brought in the Gemara) \"...and dipped the tunic [ketonet] in the blood\", for they dipped the inner tunic in the blood of anger and the vengeance came forth from the angry impulse which overpowered them.  And it is known that of the imagery of the soul many are embarrassingly evil, and they are naturally imprinted in the depths of the soul, and at the time when these tendencies rise up to the heart a person thinks thoughts of evil, and about this it is said (Chronicles 1 29:18) \"...keep this forever, even the imagery of the thoughts of the heart of Your people\", for these are the imagery of the thoughts which come up from the depths of the soul to the heart. And on this is hinted the belt, which constricts around the heart to submerge the evil imagery in the bottom of the depths of the soul, and as such the length of it was 32 (ל\"ב) Amos, like the number for heart (לב), and this act of embroidery alludes to the imagery that is made in it.  And on this it's written [in the Gemara] that the belt atones for thought of the heart.   And they said [in Pirkei Avos 4:28] \"Jealousy, lust, and honor remove a person from the world\", and after one's soul has become purified from jealousy which arises from the impulse of anger, and lust from the impulse of lust, then one must humble oneself from the attribute of arrogance.  For it [arrogance] is the source of seeking honor, and through it comes the mitre to cover one's head because it's said the Shechinah [Divine presence] is above one's head, as it says [Talmud Shabbat 156b] \"Cover your head so that the fear of Heaven will be upon you\".  For if one thinks that Hashem and all of His Holiness with him is above his own head, he will dress in humility and he \"will be like dirt and ashes\" in front of the honor of The King.  And for this reason the mitre was 16 Amos, for the divine chariot which is above his head had 4 animals each with 4 faces, which is 16.  And the mitre of the High Priest was even longer, because corresponding to his greatness he needed to surrender more and to recognize even more the greatness of his creator and his own lowliness, and this is what it [the Gemara] says 'mitre atones for the arrogant'.  And all of these garments are equal for the High Priest and a normal priest, for they are garments of the (lower) animal soul, regarding which every human being is equal.  However the High Priest in comparison to his brothers had another four garments to clothe his (upper) speaking &amp; intellectual soul.  For the first [garment] is that he should guard his speech and what comes out of his lips should. be nothing but Torah and Awe of Hashem, and he shouldn't increase idle chatter..."

And I have explained that which it repeats, \"once a year he shall atone,\" in the commentary on the Sifra (Achrei Mot 84). And on the homiletical level, [this verse] means that Aaron was the root and source of the entire priesthood until the end of all the generations. For all of the descendants of Aharon merited the priesthood in his merit. And the procedure of the high priest on Yom Kippur is called by the name, Aaron - as it is written (Leviticus 16:3), \"With this shall Aaron come to the Holy,\" and so too, always. [That is] because all of the high priests after him entered from his agency and from his merit. Accordingly, the explanation of, \"and Aaron shall atone upon its horns,\" is meaning to say that every priest that atones is called by the name of Aaron. And the explanation of the reason is, because \"with blood of the sin offering of purification, once a year he shall atone upon it (or, for him) throughout the ages\" - since the atonement of Aaron will endure for eternal generations, \"because it/he is most holy to the Lord\" - meaning to say that Aaron is most holy, as it is written (I Chronicles 23:13), \"And Aaron was separated, to be consecrated as most holy.\" And so he is the cause of the atonement for [all future] generations, through the service that he performed in the sanctuary on the first Yom Kippur. For this remained as a conduit [for], and to impact upon, the atonements that will be in the [future]."
