                "For they were sent about this, to see the goodness of the land... Since they were sent about this detail, they had to give an answer to those that sent them. And they admitted about this that, \"It is a good land\" from the perspective of [it being], \"that the Lord our God is giving [it] to us\" - that if the Lord gives it to us miraculously, there is no objection about the land itself. And [Moshe] did not mention that which they said (Numbers 13:28), \"However, the people who inhabit the country are powerful\" - as this was not an answer, since they were not sent about this... So [the people] should not have paid attention to this, since they gave a positive answer to that which they were sent about. And regarding that which they said, \"the people are powerful,\" they were not sent about it."

                "<b>For:</b> Now it comes to explain that which is written (Deuteronomy 11:9), \"in order that you may prolong days on the land,\" and to clarify that even after you inherit the land, you will not prolong your days upon it when you do not observe God's commandments. And it stated that <b>the land where you are arriving to inherit is not like the land of Egypt</b>. This means to say that one should not wonder why He took them out of the land of Egypt in order to bring them into the land of Israel, and why did He not give the land of Egypt, which was also a good land, and the Egyptians were liable for punishment for their subjugation and their afflicting them. So it would have been correct to destroy the Egyptians and to give the Israelites their land. About this, it answers that this is why you went out of the land of Egypt: Because Egypt drinks water from the Nile, which overflows and waters the land once a year; so it does not need rain from the Heavens. As rain is providential and falls on account of God's individualized providence, such that [in] a land the life of which comes from the rain, everyone constantly requires mercy from Heaven, that He should give them rain in its time. However, the inhabitants of Egypt - which drinks from the Nile - do not look to mercy from Heaven. For when the river waters the land once, the land gives off its bounty naturally. And this is what the verse writes, that \"the land where you are arriving to inherit is not like the land of Egypt\" - the reason for <b>which you departed from there</b> and He did not give you the land of Egypt is because it is <b>where you planted your seed and watered [it] on foot like a vegetable garden</b>, and it does not require providential rain."

                "...We have learned from that which it states, \"and cast them away to another land,\" that the exile will be in this manner of casting out only until they reach the other land; but in the lands of the nations, it was only in the manner of of driving away... And there is a difference between \"casting away\" and \"driving away\" in three things: A) In that one who casts [something] away and throws [it] makes the thing distant from him; B) that by being cast away, the thing spoils; and C) he shows that he does not want to know where it lays. But one who drives [something] away needs to be close to the thing the whole time he is driving it away; and by driving it away, the thing does not spoil; and he knows the place of that thing. So it is possible to explain, \"and you shall take it to heart amidst the various nations\" - when you dwell among the nations, you shall put into your heart, \"that which the Lord your God has driven you out\" - that He has driven you out to a special place. It is like someone who drives something from one place to another until he finds a place where it can rest properly. And this is a proof that the eyes of the Lord your God are upon you for the good."
