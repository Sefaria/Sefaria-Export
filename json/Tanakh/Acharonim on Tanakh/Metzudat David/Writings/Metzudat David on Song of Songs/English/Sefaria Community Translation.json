And they were hidden inside, behind a veil. So that, by this, they would draw greater love and desire than if they were revealed without a veil. And the analogue is the Sanhedrin, the judges of the community, who are like the face of the congregation; and they were filled with every wisdom and knowledge, like a pomegranate is full of seeds. And they would hide their wisdom in their hearts and not showcase it before [other] people. "
