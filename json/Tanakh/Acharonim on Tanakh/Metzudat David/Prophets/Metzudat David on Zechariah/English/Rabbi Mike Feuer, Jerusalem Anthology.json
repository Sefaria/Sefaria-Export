Nevertheless, I will dwell among you and not among the many idolaters: and you shall know – Then, when He causes His Presence to dwell among you alone, you will know that the Lord sent me to you. That is to say, the primary purpose and cause is spoken in regard to you:"

The prophet said that in truth Zion is very beloved to Me and because of what the Babylonians did to her I was enraged with a great jealousy. I was furiously jealous against the Babylonians for her sake:"

This will come to be when you listen to the voice of the Lord, because the essential purpose of that redemption was in order to establish in that sacred location a place prepared for the sake of serving Gd praying before Him that the total redemption occur in their day, as it is written “And it shall come to pass if you hearken to the voice of the Lord your God.” (Zechariah 6:15) This means to say that the total redemption will be in their day if they listen to the voice of the Lord: shall be called – Then you will call Jerusalem the city of truth because at that time her inhabitants will act in truth: and the mount of the Lord of Hosts – This refers to the place of the Temple. It will then be called the holy mountain because the Divine Presence will dwell there:"
