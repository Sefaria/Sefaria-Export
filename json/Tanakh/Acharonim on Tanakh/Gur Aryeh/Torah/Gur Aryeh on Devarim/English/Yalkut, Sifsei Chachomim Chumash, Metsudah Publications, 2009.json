                "<b>In all of your cities.</b> The court for each tribe was appointed first, and was more important. However in this verse the court of each city is mentioned first because that is where most judgment occurs. The court of the tribe has greater authority in that they can force litigants to appear before them, as Ramban explains, and if the city court is in doubt they come to ask the court of the tribe."

Every man requires personal perfection, and he requires a wife and a livelihood. Therefore the verse states, “between blood and blood” which alludes to relations between a husband and wife; “between decision and decision” which alludes to how one should act with others; and “between leprosy and leprosy” which alludes to how one should act with himself. It is appropriate for the High Court to be involved with these three matters, for the existence of the world depends upon them."

                "<b>Whichever man.</b> In the first chapter of <i>Sota</i> the Gemara states: 40 days before a child is formed a voice comes out from Heaven and states, “so-and-so will marry this child, such and such a house will belong to this child, such and such a field will belong to this child.” The Gemara lists three things which are the essentials for a person. For this reason the <i>kohein</i> warns specifically about these three things. As long as a person has not completed these three he may not go to battle. The Satan tries to attack at times of danger. Specifically in these three areas which were decreed the Satan challenges, in order to prevent a person reaching his potential. Alternatively, due to not yet having completed these three things a person will become depressed and put himself in danger. However, according to the opinion of Rabbi Yossi HaGalili, this is not considered a time of danger, and there is no need for a person to be afraid. However, he returns from battle in order to protect those who are returning due to sins that they have committed."

When someone lies and cheats with their weights and measures, the enemy comes and enters his border. The Sages state: The prohibition of uneven weights is worse than that of forbidden relations” (Bava Basra 88b) because there is no way of returning money stolen from the public. Furthermore he is lying about something which has a precise measure, and this is worse, therefore the ruler who is the worst punishment comes against him and attacks him."
