                "<b>These are the heads.</b> The Torah writes this to inform us of the length of the enslavement, for Levi was forty-three when he came to Egypt, and for the remaining ninety-four years of his life there was no enslavement (Levi lived 137 years, v. 16, see <i>Rashi</i> ad loc.). Subtract the 94 years of no enslavement from the 210 years total they sojourned in Egypt, and you conclude that the enslavement lasted 116 years."

                "<b>For this time.</b> During the first three plagues (דצ''ך—blood, frogs, and lice) Pharaoh did not believe that the plagues came from Hashem and His Providence, because they struck the entire land of Egypt. In the next group (עד''ש—wild animals, pestilence, and rash) Hashem told him He would set apart the land of Goshen, and he perceived the Divine Providence. In the final set (באח''ב—hailstones, locusts, darkness, and the killing of the firstborn) Hashem showed him that He was Unique, for they were exceptionally miraculous plagues. Therefore, Hashem referred to this set all together as, “all my plagues,” especially in reference to the killing of the firstborn."
