They were said in Sinai, and were repeated in the Tent of Meeting and were said a third time in the wilderness of Moav, and on each mitzvah 16 covenants were established: 16 on Sinai, 16 in the Tent of Meeting and 16 in the Wilderness of Moav, and that makes for 48; and there are 48 warnings against them in the Torah regarding gerim and 48 times  regarding the ger that comes to cling to Torahin which 48 covenants were established."
