This is in fulfillment of the curse that he proclaimed against himself, “[And if not,] blot me out from Your book” (Shemos 32:32). Although this curse was conditional upon God’s refusal to forgive the people for the sin of the Calf, the curse of a scholar is fulfilled in some way, even when made conditionally. The expression “command” is used in connection with both the oil and the daily sacrifice (Bamidbar 28:2) because both entail a daily expense and therefore need reinforcement."
