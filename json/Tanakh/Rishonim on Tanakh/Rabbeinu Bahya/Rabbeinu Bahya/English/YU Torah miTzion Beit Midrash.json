                    "Understand that here, [Bamidbar 14:18] Moshe mentioned, “Hashem, slow to anger”, but [unlike after the Golden Calf] he did not mention, “Hashem, G-d, merciful and compassionate,” and he did not mention, “and truth, granting kindness to thousands [of generations],” and he further did not mention “[forgiving of accidental] sin”. This is not happenstance but by complete design.  Through these [differences] Moshe taught us the ways of prayer and supplication –how a person who is praying should pray and how one who is beseeching should beseech, in order to be favoured by one’s Master. This is the reason why the thirteen attributes [of mercy] which were taught to him at Sinai were not [fully] mentioned here, but only six, with seven missing. He did not mention, “Hashem, G-d, merciful and compassionate,” because those apply only for ‎one who is primarily meritorious, and at this point, the majority of Israel were sinners.‎ He did not mention, “Hashem, G-d, merciful and compassionate,” because those apply only for ‎one who is primarily meritorious, and at this point, the majority of Israel were sinners. ‎He did not mention “and truth”, because truth would have found [the nation] liable, for [truth] is ‎the attribute of strict judgement, as taught by our sages: “Regarding truth, G-d does not go ‎beyond the law [to forgive].” (Avodah Zarah 4b). They believed the words of the spies, which ‎eliminated faith, and it was cut off from their mouths.‎‏ ‏He did not mention “granting kindness to ‎thousands [of generations]” because this time Moshe was not praying in the merit of the ‎ancestors, as they had just rejected the land that the ancestors had chosen. For the same reason, ‎he did not say, “Remember Avraham and Yitzchak,” as he had done following the making of the ‎golden calf, when he prayed for them in this trouble.‎‏ ‏And he did not mention “[forgiving of ‎accidental] sin,” because they had acted with intent.‎‏ ‏It was necessary [for Moshe] to include ‎‎“Hashem” in his prayer, as this was the first Name G-d mentioned to him in the thirteen attributes.‎",
                    " And in the Talmud (Rosh HaShanah 17b): “’Hashem, Hashem”: one is before a person sins and ‎returns, and one is after a person sins and returns.” He has mercy even upon one who is mostly ‎sinful, as perhaps he will return. This is similar to Tehillim 145:9, “Hashem is good to all, and His ‎mercy is upon all His creations.” But here “Hashem” is only mentioned once, and this is the ‎reference to “Hashem” [forgiving] after a sin, for here they were sinners who had not returned. ‎The meaning of “Hashem [forgiving] after a sin” is that there is not a change or activation after a ‎sin, as there is before a sin, which is not the case for a flesh and blood king."

                    "Here we should ask: Did Bilaam have the power to damage and cause benefit, or not? If you say ‎that he had (the ability to effectively curse), how is it possible that flesh and blood could change a ‎decree of the Creator? For if the Creator decreed on Israel, \"For they are blessed (Bamidbar ‎‎22:12),\" how could (Bilaam)'s curse change what was already decreed? And if you will say there is ‎no substance in his curse, then why did G-d stop him, as it says, \"You shall not curse the nation ‎‎(Bamidbar 22:12)\"? Let Bilaam curse all day as long as G-d blesses (the Jewish people), like the ‎passage, \"They curse, and you bless (Tehillim 109:28)\"! ‎ The answer to this is that Bilaam did not have any power at all in his speech to effectuate a ‎blessing or curse. There is proof that the curses he expressed did not have power, from the fact ‎that the blessings he expressed did not have power. If he had power in his speech to bless, then ‎when it became clear to him that it was not the will of G-d to curse Israel as Balak had commanded ‎him, why didn’t he bless Balak and his nation? This would have completed the intent of Balak that ‎Israel should not rule over him. And why did he push himself into being rented for the silverv and ‎gold of Balak? Let him bless himself that he should become a great king over all the other kings, ‎and he wouldn’t need his (Balak‟s) silver and gold. Indeed, we find explicitly that he (Bilaam) ‎blessed himself in saying \"May my soul die the death of the upright (Bamidbar 23:10)\", and his ‎blessing was not fulfilled  – rather, his end was terrible and his hope turned into frustration, for he ‎died an abnormal death as it is written, \"And Bilaam the son of Beor the sorcerer, they killed with ‎the sword (Yehoshua 13:22).\"‎‎ We see that he did not have the power in his speech to curse through his words. However, in his ‎wisdom he knew how to figure out the time that G-d would become angry, and he definitely had ‎the power in his speech to curse.‎ Nonetheless, the question still stands in its place: We know that Hashem did not get angry in those ‎days (Brachot 7a), so all of his words and wisdom were nullified, the strength of his speech and ‎wisdom collapsed… So why didn’t (G-d) leave him to curse them? Why did He say to him, \"Do not ‎curse the nation (Bamidbar 22:12)\"?‎ The answer is that G-d knew of the plague that was to occur (see the end of the Parshat Balak), ‎and lest they say that the plague was because of Bilaam’s curse, He prevented him from cursing. ‎But, certainly, Bilaam did not have any power from the side of his speech to bless or to curse, only ‎from his wisdom in identifying the time when G-d would be angry.‎"
