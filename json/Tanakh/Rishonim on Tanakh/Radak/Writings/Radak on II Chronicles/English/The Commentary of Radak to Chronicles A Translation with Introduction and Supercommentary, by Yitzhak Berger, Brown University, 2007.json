They are called alien-converts (<i>gerim</i>) because they were not idol-worshipers; for in the days of David and Solomon, when the Israelites had the upper hand, they did not permit them to worship idols.

It might be that the porch alone was this tall, and that it extended above the Temple. Alternatively, the entire Temple was the same height; and when it says in Kings “and its height was thirty cubits” it means from the floor of the Temple to the ceiling, whereas above the ceiling there were upper stories ninety cubits high, as it says “its storerooms and its upper chambers” (1 Chr 28:11). Indeed, it says [here], “and the upper chambers he overlaid with gold” (v. 9). But what I consider most likely is that the porch alone was this tall, because <i>it</i> contained the upper chambers. That is why the text relates the upper chambers to the porch when it says, “David gave his son Solomon the plan for the porch and its chambers, its storerooms, and <i>its upper chambers</i> and inner rooms” (1 Chr ibid.).

When the text says, “and the height was one hundred and twenty,” therefore, it refers to the porch alone. There cannot be an objection on the grounds that, because it says “and <i>the</i> height was one hundred and twenty” instead of “and <i>its</i> height,” it seems to refer to the entire Temple. After all, it says “spanning <i>the</i> length,” not “spanning <i>its</i> length.” When the text says, “David gave his son Solomon the plan for the porch,” this does not include the Great Hall and the inner Sanctuary. Rather, they are included in “and its chambers.” The text relates the Great Hall to [the porch] even though the Great Hall was longer than it: because the porch was the outer chamber, the text relates the inner chambers—that is, the Great Hall and the recesses in its walls—to the porch.

After all, the poles were no more than ten cubits long. For the Holy of Holies in the Tent of Meeting was only ten, and the Ark was placed in it, and it does not say in the Torah that the poles were visible from outside the curtain. So if the width of the inner Sanctuary [of Solomon’s Temple] was <i>twenty</i> cubits (2 Chr 3:8), how could [the poles] have been seen upon the front of <i>it</i>? Possibly, they made other poles for the Ark that were longer than those, in order that they be seen upon the front of the inner Sanctuary. That would explain why the text says <i>vayya’arikhu</i>, which is a transitive verb, and not <i>vayya’arkhu</i>. It is also possible to explain that these <i>were</i> the same poles that were on the Ark initially. It might be that they were ten cubits long, and that before they brought the Ark into the inner Sanctuary, the poles were inserted into the Ark symmetrically, extending behind it the same distance as in front of it. After all, four people would carry it, each pole by two people: one in front and one in back. But when they brought the Ark into the inner Sanctuary in that state—with its poles—and it was no longer to be carried by shoulder, they extended the poles, pulling them outward until their tips were seen upon the front of the inner Sanctuary, so that the high priest might enter there on the Day of Atonement to offer incense between the poles without shifting in one direction or the other. For this reason, then, they extended the poles until the front of the inner Sanctuary, <b>although they could not be seen from the outside</b>, [meaning] outside the front of the inner Sancutary. And if you will ask: Still, because the poles were only ten cubits long, and the width of the inner Sanctuary was twenty, then how could they have been seen upon the front of it? Possibly, they did not place the Ark close to the west wall but far away from it. The way the wingspread of the cherubim extended over the Ark and its poles (v. 8) is that it was twenty cubits wide, as it was long (2 Chr 3:13). Alternatively, the width of the wings was equal to the width of the Ark and its poles. In a midrashic vein, our Sages, of blessed memory (b. Yoma 54a), say: “It says ‘the tips of the poles were seen’ and ‘but they could not be seen from the outside.’ How so? They pressed up against the curtain and protruded outward, so that they looked like the two breasts of a woman, as it says, ‘he sleeps between my breasts’ (Song 1:13).” But we have no need for this midrashic interpretation; for the text says that they were seen <i>upon the front</i> of the inner Sanctuary. They were not, however, visible from outside its wall. Nor do I know why they say (b. Megillah 10b) that the space occupied by the Ark is not part of the dimensions and that it was situated there miraculously. For the text says that the wingspread of the cherubim extended over the Ark (v. 8). The Ark, then, was under the wings of the cherubim and need not be included in the calculation. So what reason is there to impose a miracle where it is not necessary? What they say (b. ibid.) is that there were ten cubits to each side of the Ark. But we do not find that, nor is it possible according to the verses! Those who said this, however, knew what they were saying, because their understanding was greater than ours.",

Instead, they remained extended to the front of the inner Sanctuary forever: that is the meaning of “<b>to this day</b>.” It emerges, then, that the doors on the opening to the inner Sanctuary were not closed.

So it emerges that when Asa became king, Jeroboam was still alive. He even lived for two years after Asa became king, for Jeroboam reigned for twenty-two years (1 Kgs 14:20). The text means, rather, that the Lord inflicted harm upon him in his battles—as it says, “God inflicted harm upon Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah” (v. 15)—“and he died,” meaning that he died in that lowly state, unable to muster any more strength from the time that Abijah reigned. But in Genesis Rabbah (65:20) and in Seder Olam (16), [the phrase] “inflicted harm upon him” is interpreted to refer to Abijah; and it is explained that this was for the sin of conquering Bethel (v. 19) without purging it of idolatrous entities—for he had found one of the calves there. There is another midrashic interpretation (y. Yevamot 82b) that is improbable: “‘The Lord inflicted harm upon him’—you think this means Jeroboam? No—it means Abijah! And why was he harmed?

In Asa’s case, the text mentions his father’s mother because she was an idol-worshiper—as it says “<b>because she had made an item for the idolatrous worship of an <i>asherah</i> tree</b>”—and he nonetheless did what was pleasing to the Lord and did not follow in her footsteps. It is also possible to explain that this was a different woman, Asa’s mother, who was also named “Maacah daughter of Abishalom,” just like his father’s mother."

                "<b>In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha initiated a war.</b> How could this be? After all, it says in the book of Kings, “In the twenty-sixth year … of Asa … Elah son of Baasha became king” (1 Kgs 16:8). Also, it says there that Baasha became king over Israel in the third year of Asa and reigned over Israel for twenty-four years (1 Kgs 15:33). It emerges, then, that Baasha’s reign <i>ended</i> in the <i>twenty</i>-sixth year of Asa! It is possible to explain that when the text provides these numbers in the book of Kings, it does not count from the beginning of Asa’s reign but from the beginning of his wars, and in the beginning of his reign there was peace in the land for ten years, as it says, “During his days, there was peace in the land for ten years” (2 Chr 13:23). After all, the book of Kings discusses matters pertaining to the kings of Israel also. Hence, it does not make reference to Asa’s reign from its beginning, only from the time he began to fight, leaving out the ten years during which there was peace in the land. Two of those ten years were in the days of Jeroboam; and during the remaining eight years, either Nadab had not yet taken over as king of Israel, or if he had, the text does not count them for him because his reign was not yet secured. But in the second year after that ten-year period, Nadab became king in the full sense and fought against Asa. So when it says there “In the third year of Asa,” what it means is in the third year from when he began to fight the Israelite kings. He first fought against Nadab son of Jeroboam; and three years later Baasha became king and fought against Asa, as it says, “There was a war between Asa and Baasha … all their days” (1 Kgs 15:32). And this war that Baasha initiated, during which <b>he built up the highland</b>, was in the twenty-third year of Baasha’s reign, which was the thirty-sixth year since the beginning of Asa’s reign and the twenty-fifth or twenty-sixth year of Asa’s wars. For the text counts the second year of Nadab son of Jeroboam for Baasha also—perhaps because [Nadab] did not make it through the whole year. But in Seder Olam (16) it says that this war was in the sixteenth year of Asa, one year after the Cushite war; and when the text refers to the thirty-sixth year, it is counting from the death of Solomon. For when Solomon married Pharaoh’s daughter—in the fourth year of his reign—it was decreed that the Davidic kingship be divided for thirty-six years, equaling the thirty-six years during which Solomon was Pharaoh’s son-in-law. But the Davidic kingship was destined to return in the sixteenth year of Asa, at which point there had elapsed thirty-six years since Solomon. Yet because Asa acted wrongly in the war against Baasha, relying on the king of Aram and sending him treasures from the House of the Lord (v. 2), and not relying on the Lord (v. 7), the Davidic kingship did not return but remained divided as it was."

Moreover, his father Jehoram’s entire lifespan was only forty years, for the text says as follows: “Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years” (1 Chr 21:5)—so how could [Ahaziah] have been forty-two years old when his father died? That would be impossible! It says in Seder Olam (17): “Once Asa married off his son Jehoshaphat to Omri’s daughter, this decree was issued—that the royal family of David be wiped out along with the house of Ahab.” And that is what happened: King Ahaziah of Judah died together with the king of Israel—for Jehu killed them—and then Athaliah, Ahaziah’s mother, saw that her son was killed and she killed off all the potential royal heirs. So that is why the text counts forty-two—from the time the decree was issued. [How so?] It was in the thirty-first year of Asa that [Jehoshaphat] married [Omri’s daughter]. For the text says, “In the thirty-first year of King Asa of Judah, Omri became king over Israel” (1 Kgs 16:23)—yet he had already reigned for four years prior (1 Kgs 16:15–16)! What it means, rather, is that he became king in the full sense: he married into the family of Asa, grew in stature, and killed Tibni and reigned over Israel (1 Kgs 16:22). And from the thirty-first year of Asa until King Ahaziah of Judah died there are in fact forty-two years. How so? Nine years of Asa; twenty-five of Jehoshaphat (1 Kgs 22:42), for a total of thirty-four; and eight years of Jehoram, for a total of forty-two. But this midrash is very far from the plain sense. It is possible to explain that Jehoram lived for more than forty years, but for purposes of [counting] the duration of his reign, the text only counts the eight years during which he ruled at full strength. It does not, however, count toward his reign the years from the time he fell in the hands of the Arabs (2 Chr 21:16–17) and also fell ill (ibid. vv. 18–19). In fact, his son Ahaziah was made king in his place while his father [Jehoram] was still alive—at the time of Jehoram’s fall, after which he continued on having lost all desire (ibid. 21:20)—and those years totaled twenty. So it was when they made Ahaziah king during his father’s lifetime that he was twenty-two—that is the meaning of the assertion in Kings, “Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king”—and it was when his father died that he was forty-two. And he only reigned for <b>one year</b> after his father’s death.",

It might be that they pursued him but did not catch up to him. After all, the text does not say “<i>they killed</i> him on the chariot,” but rather “<i>kill</i> him.” So they did not actually catch up to him but rather shot arrows at him, whereas he managed to flee, as it says, “He fled to Megiddo” (ibid.). Perhaps he then left Megiddo; and when the text says “and he died there” (ibid.), it does not mean that he really died. Rather, the arrows struck him on the road while he was fleeing, and he fled to Megiddo and “died” there in the sense of having been knocked out because of his wounds—just as the text says “and he died” concerning Nabal (1 Sam 25:37) even though he did not die until ten days later (ibid. v. 38). Then afterward, [Ahaziah’s] servants carried him to hide in Samaria, which he did. But Jehu’s servants found him there <b>and brought him to Jehu and killed him</b>—for he had not yet died. When the text then says here, “<b>And they buried him, for it was said, ‘He is a son of Jehoshaphat</b>,<b>’</b>” it means that they designated him for burial, allowing his servants to carry him to Jerusalem, as it says in Kings, “His servants conveyed him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and they buried him in his grave with his fathers, in the city of David” (2 Kgs 9:28).",

The proof that some of the sacred things of the House of the Lord remained is that in the book of Kings, when Hazael initiates a battle on Jerusalem, it says, “King Joash of Judah took all the objects that had been consecrated by Jehoshaphat, Jehoram …” (2 Kgs 12:19).

For when the text says “Hezekiah sent word to all Israel and Judah … to observe Passover” (v. 1), this was <i>because</i> he had come to an agreement with the officers and the congregation to observe Passover in the second month. I wonder about what our Sages say (b. Berakhot 10b) that [Hezekiah] added another Nisan during Nisan [itself], and that [the rabbinic authorities] did not accede to this. For the text says, “The king came to an agreement <b>with his officers and the entire congregation in Jerusalem</b>”—so it says that they did accede to it! They also have no proof from the verse that he added another Nisan during Nisan. For this agreement could have taken place in Adar—to make a second Adar in place of Nisan and to observe Passover in the second month; that is, Iyyar: it could have been turned into Nisan so that they might observe Passover in it. Moreover, as for the assertions they make (b. Sanhedrin 12a-b) in debating why Hezekiah sought mercy (v. 18), it is explicit, after all, that this was because many of the people had eaten the paschal sacrifice in an unclean state, as the text says, “yet they ate the paschal sacrifice in violation of what was written” (ibid.)!",
                "<b>To observe Passover in the second month.</b> This was not akin to a “second Passover,” because they did not observe Passover in the month of Nisan at all. Instead, they changed Nisan into Adar: they made it a leap year because of the uncleanness and because of the people who would not have been able to reach Jerusalem. For their hearts had not yet acquiesced to serve God, and they had not wanted to come to Jerusalem to make the paschal sacrifice, as the text says, “because <i>la-rov</i> they did not do as was written” (v. 5). That is, to this point, <i>rov</i> (=most) of Israel had not done as was written, because they had been worshiping idols and did not care to come to Jerusalem for the service of God—hence the need to make it a leap year and extend the time. For even though Hezekiah had sent couriers (v. 6), most people mocked them (v. 10). And even those who came did not all sanctify themselves but rather ate the paschal sacrifice in an unclean state (vv. 17–18), so that Hezekiah had to seek mercy on their behalf, as the text says (v. 18). Thus, they were compelled to make it a leap year: they assigned the second month the status of Nisan, made the paschal sacrifice in it, and made the seven-day Feast of Unleavened Bread."

Our Sages, of blessed memory (cf. b. Yoma 52b, Horayot 12a), explain that [Josiah] ordered that the Ark be hid away so that it not be taken away with the exile. They say that there was a stone in the Holy of Holies, at its west side: the Ark was placed on top of it, and the container of manna and the staff of Aaron in front of it. For when Solomon built the Temple knowing that it would eventually be destroyed, he built an area underneath in which to hide away the Ark—in deep and windy hidden compartments; and this stone was the cover for that place. So on King Josiah’s order, the Ark was hidden away in that area <b>that Solomon</b> had<b> built</b>—as it says, “Put the Holy Ark …”—and the staff of Aaron, the container of manna, and the anointing oil were hidden away with it."
