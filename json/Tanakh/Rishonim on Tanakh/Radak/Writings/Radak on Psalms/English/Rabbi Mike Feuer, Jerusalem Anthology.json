                "But as for the river – its rivulets – At the time when the mountains quake and collapse and the waters of the sea are stirred up, that is to say – when there will be great distress and war between the kingdoms of the nations, Israel will not be afraid but instead will rejoice.  This is what is said in a metaphorical fashion: but as for the river, its rivulets will make to rejoice. In opposition to the raging seas it says that a river will come out from Jerusalem, which is the city of God. The rivulets of that river will make the city of God to rejoice, meaning the inhabitants of the city of God. That city is ‘the holy place of the dwellings of the Most High,’ meaning that all of the land of Israel is the dwelling of the Most High and the holiest place within it is Jerusalem. This metaphor is like that of “And you shall draw water with joy from the fountains of the salvation.” (Isaiah 12:3) Or it is to be understood literally, as it is written “And it shall come to pass on that day that spring water shall come forth from Jerusalem…” (Zechariah 14:8)"

                "The fairest of branches (nof) – Mount Zion is the beauty of the place, there is nothing as beautiful as it in all the place. And it is ‘the joy of the entire earth’ as it is written “Is this the city that was called the perfection of beauty, the joy of all the earth?” (Lamentations 2:15) The meaning of nof is place, as in “…the three regions (hanafet).” (Joshua 17:11) My father and master explained nof as one of the seven divisions of the world, because it is known that the settled world is divided into seven pieces as they said ‘the seven lands.’ These portions are called in Hebrew nafot and in Arabic iclimim. And he said that anyone who goes from one nof to another will fall ill due to the change in air. The air of the land of Israel, and all the more so the air of Jerusalem, was the fairest nof and the joy of all the earth. Even sick people who came there were healed because its air was well mixed and pleasant. As it says about it “And the neighbor shall not say, ‘I am sick.’” (Isaiah 33:24) Meaning that one who dwells in Jerusalem will not say ‘I am sick.’ Mount Zion, by the north side – Zion is on the north side of Jerusalem, as it says “…and I will sit on the mount of the assembly, in the farthest end of the north.” (Isaiah 14:13)  The previous part of the verse “above God's stars will I raise my throne” is a metaphor regarding Israel. the city of a great (rav) king – a great king, as in “…upon every steward of his house…” (Esther 1:8) This is referring to David, as it says “…the city wherein David encamped.” (Isaiah 29:1) Or this is referring to the King Messiah. In the midrash (Shachar Tov 48) it says everyone glorifies her, because there was none other like her. Even though Tyre said ‘I am the perfection of beauty’ as it says “Tyre, you said, 'I am the perfection of beauty.'” (Ezekiel 27:3) You said this of yourself, but others did not say it to you. This is like the common saying: not as your mother said, but as your neighbors said. But it doesn’t say this about Zion, rather everyone says “Is this the city that was called the perfection of beauty, the joy of all the earth?” (Lamentations 2:15) And further ‘the joy of all the earth.’ And how did she bring joy to all the earth? If a man sinned and is downhearted, as Shlomo says “If there is concern in a man's heart, let him cast it down, and a good word will make it cheerful,” (Proverbs 12:25) he would go to Jerusalem and offer a sacrifice which would atone for him. His heart would rejoice and he would leave there joyful that he had been forgiven, therefore she is the joy of all the earth. ",
                "Know that it is so, as it says “Mount Zion, by the north side” and it says “…on the northern side of the Mishkan…” (Exodus 40:22)"

                "With Your will, do good – In these last two verses it appears that the Holy Spirit returned to him while he was still praying. It says in this psalm “Restore to me the joy of Your salvation…” (Psalms 51:14) And so it was that it returned to him, because these verses are a prophecy of the future. He saw with the Holy Spirit that in the future the Holy Temple would be destroyed, both the first and the second, because of the sins. Even though they were offering the sacrifices continually, since their actions were evil God rejected the offerings and destroyed the Sanctuary. In the days of the Messiah the offerings will be acceptable because all of Israel will serve the Lord with one heart. Therefore it says “With Your will, do good to Zion…”"

                "Why do you lurk (tratzdun) – There are those who explain tratzdun as dance, meaning why do you praise yourselves? You are considered nothing compared the mountain which God desired for His dwelling, which is the mountain of the House. Rabbenu Hai explained tratzdun as a language of consideration and expectation, comparing it to the Arabic in this case. The meaning then would be – why are you interested in and in expectation of honor? Honor is due only to the mountain which God desired for His dwelling. This is the mountain of the House where the Holy Temple is located, the cause of the glory of Jerusalem because there the glory is seen continually, as well as His aid and compassion. Behold, over all of the land of Israel the hand of the enemy rules, and of Jerusalem it says “…neither shall he shoot there an arrow, nor shall he advance upon it with a shield, nor shall he pile up a siege mound against it,” (Isaiah 37:33) and it says “And I will protect this city to save it…” (Isaiah 37:35) And the verse continues ‘Even the Lord will dwell there forever’ because on mount Sinai He did not dwell forever:"
