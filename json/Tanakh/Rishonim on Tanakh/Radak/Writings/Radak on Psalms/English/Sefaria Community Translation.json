                "1 \"because [they defied the statements of God, spurned the intent of the Most High].\"  [The Psalmist] informed them that they were taken captive on account of their iniquity, for they had \"defied the statements/'imrei of God,\" which refers to the precepts that He had commanded to humanity.  It was not to Israel alone that commandments were issued, but also to all peoples.  He distinguished Israel from the (other) nations by commanding them concerning additional precepts, sanctifying them through the purity of body and food.  However, traditional precepts were granted to the first Man and his progeny (i.e., the Seven Noachide Laws).  These are \"the statements of God.\""

                "There are manuscripts [of the book of Psalms] in which this verse [115:1] is not the beginning of the psalm. [In other words, those manuscripts join together Psalms 114 and 115.]. [The Psalmist] said that, just as You have performed acts of lovingkindness for our ancestors by taking them out of Egypt, so may you do for us in every generation.  Even though we are not worthy, do not do so 'for us' (115:1) but for your Name's sake.  For they [the generation of the Exodus] likewise would not have been worthy had it not been for the glory of Your name and [Your] covenant with the Fathers.  He says \"not for our sake\" twice in order to emphasize the point."

                "[Adonai] is good to all.  He is good and merciful even to wild animals, domesticated animals, and fowl.  And so it is fitting for a person to follow these ways of His.  One should not destroy life other than for a need or to guard oneself from dangers.  So we find that our Holy Master (Rabbi Judah the Prince, editor of the Mishnah) bade his handmaiden not to sweep up mice with household embers.  Rather, she should let them live in the cellar.  He said to her, \"It is written, 'His mercy is upon all His works.'\""
