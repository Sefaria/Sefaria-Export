And my master, my father, may his memory be blessed, explained,\"<i>tishlachenah</i>,\" [as] her [left] hand and her right hand sent out (such that the verb is understandably conjugated in the plural) for the tent pin and the hammer. She required her left hand for the tent peg; and her right, for the hammer. And it attributed sending to the hands because they performed the act.

For acts of power are not done by women, but rather by men. Hence it said by way of a question, \"Do the other women send out [their hands] - like her hand - for the tent peg, and the right hand for the worker's hammer (<i>halmut</i>)?\" And   <i>halmut</i> is the name of the tool with which working craftsmen strike.",

And it can be explained as follows: <i>\"And it will be for God,\" i.e. sanctified [הקדש], if it is unsuitable for a burnt offering. <b>Or</b> it \"shall be offered by me as a burnt offering,\" if it is suitable for a burnt offering.</i> And similar to this, the <i>vav</i> of \"He who strikes his father or [ו] his mother\" (Exodus 25:15) signifies \"or\". And it is well explained, and so it seems to me from the verse, for it is not death, because the verse would say \"And I will weep for my life\" -- rather, [she will weep] that she has not known a man [because in fact the verse says \"I will weep for my maidenhood\" (Judges 11:37)]. And that which it also says, \"he did to her as he had vowed to do\" (Judges 11:39), and it does not say \"He offered her as a burnt offering.\" This shows us that she was celibate/separated, and this is what he had vowed -- that she should be for God.
