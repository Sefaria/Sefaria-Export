                "<i><b>Zonah</b></i> literal, or a seller of baked goods, like the Targum Yonatan has it, seller of baked goods [<i>pundekita</i>], and this is with a good weight. And the true opinion of Yonatan was an actual <i>zonah</i>, since such was the way in places, to translate <i>zonah</i> as seller of baked goods. And so \"two women who were prostitutes [<i>zonot</i>]\" (I Kings 3:16), [is translated in Targum Jonathan as] sellers of baked goods [<i>pundekan</i>]. And this even though a few of the translations are according to the opinion of Bara, and his opinion was that a <i>zonah</i> is like a seller of baked goods in that she sells herself to all."

And even for matza, matza is forbidden from the new grain... And from where did they have old grain? From that which the merchants of the [other] nations sold to them. And the word meavor proves that it was from the old grain. For I say that the grain that is from the year that passed (avrah) is called avor, and [grain from] the next year is called produce (tevuah).",

                "<b>Joshua left alive (<i>hecheyah</i>):</b> As he commanded to keep the oath that the messengers swore to her, as he said (Josh. 6:17), \"Only Rachav the harlot, etc.\" But one can also explain <i>hecheyah</i> [to mean] that he gave them nourishment (<i>micheyah</i>), money or an inheritance from which they could live. And this is [the meaning of] what it states, \"and she dwelt among the Israelites.\" And this is the correct explanation. And there is a homily (<i>drash</i>) that Yehoshua took Rachav as a wife. And this is [the meaning of] <i>hecheyah</i>, as once they saw that Yehoshua took Rachav as a wife, some of the Jewish notables clung to the house of her father (and gave them assistance). And even though it is written about the seven peoples [of Canaan] (Deut. 7:4), \"you shall not intermarry with them,\" they said that Rachav and the house of her father were foreigners and were not from the seven nations. And there is someone who says that went the spies that Yehoshua had sent entered Jericho, she converted - and the Israelites had not yet entered the Land [of Israel]. And all of this [last suggestion] is according to the [position] that holds that when it is written, \"you shall not intermarry with them,\" it is [only] written about when they are in their state of being of the nations (as opposed to having converted)."
