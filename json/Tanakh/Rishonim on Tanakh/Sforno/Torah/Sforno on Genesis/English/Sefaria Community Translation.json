                    "\"And G-d divided between the light and the darkness\" - on those days during which the primeval light prevailed there were periods of light and periods of darkness without [need for] the power of the rotations of a [heavenly] sphere, rather though Divine Will [alone], for He divided between the time of light and the time of darkness."

                    "\"And it was evening and it was morning\" - even though He separated the light and the darkness so that they would prevail during separate, alternating periods with [need for] rotation of a [heavenly] sphere, He separated them gradually, in such a manner that there was between them a time of \"evening\" before the onset of night, and a time of \"morning\" before the onset of day."

Now behold, thereby, they [the waters] necessarily ascended to some boundary in the elemental air, and the air necessarily was subject to some transformation which made a place for a portion which was converted to vapor, and it expanded to a place much great in volume than its original place."

                    "\"And G-d made the firmament\" - and it was that when some of the elemental water was removed from under that part of the waters which became vaporous in nature, as it was when He said, \"let the waters be gathered from beneath the heavens\" Genesis 1:9, it was fit that the vaporous part would descend to that same place from which the that [non-vaporous portion of] waters was removed. But He made it such that that \"firmament\" that separates would have the power to stop and prevent the vaporous portion from descending - that's the \"waters which are above the firmament\", such that the transformed atmospheric portion would descend, while the vaporous would remain in its original place. Because of this, when the moist vapor reaches it [i.e., the firmament], it condenses and gives rise to rain, snow and hail. As they condense they descend, as it is said, \"at the sound of His placing an abundance of water in the heavens\" Jeremiah 10:13. - what it wanted by saying \"heavens\": the  firmament which condenses the atmospheric part [of the waters], as it is said \"And G-d called the firmament \"heavens\" Genesis 1:8. Now when the cloudy, excited vapor arrives there [at the firmament], it generates thunder and lightning, and it is said: \"He lifts up clouds from the ends of the earth, thunder from the rain He makes\" [continuation of verse quoted previously from Jeremiah]. Now, seeing as how some of the heavier watery element is above the lighter air, which from our perspectives is against their nature - this without doubt indicates the action of an volitional actor, intended such an outcome, as it is said, \"the work of His hands shall the firmament declare\" Psalms 19:2",
                    "\"and it was so\" - it remained thus against its nature."

Therefor it [the word] is said regarding G-d, may He be blessed, and regarding His angels, and similarly it is said regarding judges in respect to that intelligent element that is fitting for them. Indeed, seeing that even though human intelligence is acquired without any material tools, and extends over abstract notions, and over future [i.e., hypothetical situation], and  is not weakened by extensive intellectual activity, nor in old age, but rather gains strength, and all of these [features] make it clear that it is doubtlessly non-material, for indeed, the opposite of all these befall the bodily, material powers, nevertheless, before he gains wisdom [lit. - ponders], being then lacking in all the perfections awaiting him, he is <b>not</b> called g0d, rather he merely called \"in the image of G-d\" until he acquires perfections, especially that wisdom through which he acquires love and awe of G-d and, for then he will be an fully-realized intelligent entity, perfect, non-material, and then he will be necessarily eternal, and will continue to exist also after the death of the body. Now since it is the choice of man whether to acquire this perfection through his effort to ponder the wisdom mentioned previously, it will therefore become clear that when he prevents himself from this, his intellectual potential will remain merely a potentiality, lacking in all actualized perfection, like it was from the beginning, and he will amount to nothing and be lost, as it says, \"man is honored, but if he will not understand, he is compared to mere beasts\" (Psalms 49:21).
