                "(1) YOU ARE CHILDREN OF ADONAI YOUR GOD. YOU SHALL NOT GASH YOURSELVES. It is not appropriate to display the extreme of worry and pain for a dead relative when there remains a more esteemed relative. Thus you are children of Adonai, for He is your Father, enduring forever, and it is not appropriate for you to worry and mourn in the extreme for any death. ...",
                "(2) NOR SHALL YOU SHAVE THE FRONT OF YOUR HEADS BECAUSE OF THE DEAD, FOR YOU ARE A PEOPLE CONSECRATED. Nor should one be very sorrowful for the injury experienced by the dead person in his death, for you are a holy people, destined for the life in the world to come, and the satisfaction in that life is better than all the life in this world.\n"

By paying especial attention to observing these laws, the leaders, which are judges, priests, kings and prophets, maintain the people at large, and in destroying them they destroy the people at large. As the prophet warned: \"The officials within her are roaring lions; her judges are wolves of the steppe, they leave no bone until morning. Her prophets are reckless, faithless fellows; her priests profane what is holy, they pervert Torah.\" (Zephania 3:3-4)"
