For all these reasons it was a worthy dwelling place for the <i>Shechinah</i> and never fell into enemy hands. The First Holy Temple, by contrast, was made at King Shelomo’s order and still housed the Tablets, but it was built with the help of non-Israelites from Tyre. Therefore even though the <i>Shechinah</i> dwelt there, it was in need of constant upkeep and was ultimately destroyed. Afterwards the Second Holy Temple was built at the order of the Persian Emperor and did not contain the Tablets. Moreover, it was not even in the charge of the Levites (see <i>Ezra</i> 8:15). Consequently the <i>Shechinah</i> never settled upon it and it, too, was destroyed in the end."

Nevertheless, Hashem’s glory appeared on a more constant basis in the Tabernacle than in the First Temple and it did not appear at all in the Second Temple. This demonstrates that it is not wealth and grandeur that cause the <i>Shechinah</i> to dwell on earth but righteous deeds."
