            "At the dawning of His Kingdom,<br>God founded a throne for His dwelling,<br>establishing it through His spirit,<br>making it through His mighty arm.<br>He brought forth wisdom and understanding,<br>treasure without limits.<br>From there flow the lives of souls;<br>all the worlds draw their existence.<br>Who can comprehend God’s comings and goings,<br>His intentions,<br>save Moses who held fast to His presence,<br>who attained a firm stance upon His foundations,<br>as it is written:<br>“He grasps hold of His throne, He spreads His cloud over him” [Job 26:9].",
            "When God established His throne during creation’s six days,<br>he formed two fawns,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Adam and Eve.</i><br>twins of a gazelle,<br>placing them in a domicile of delight,<br>a chamber with figures inlaid.<br>Nothing was denied them,<br>no false divinity was in their midst<br>nor anything of evil.<br>The intent of their creation<br>was that they would be a seed of truth,<br>“holy seed their stock” [Isa. 6:21],<br>so that they might stroll among stones of fire,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Following Ezek. 12:13–14, referring to the angels.</i><br>among the angelic watches,<br>while the <i>shekhinah</i> herself would walk in the lower worlds.",
            "So it was until a crafty man arose.<br>Iniquitous, endowed with jealous plots,<br>he devised deeds of wickedness,<br>enticing and misleading the gracious lady<br>with his blandishments.<br>Eschewing aforethought,<br>she observed not her commandment<br>but followed his counsel.<br>Swayed by her eloquence,<br>by the sweetness of her lips,<br>her husband followed her lead.<br>Thus a spirit of impurity<br>descended upon them,<br>transformed them,<br>bound itself to them and to all of their descendants,<br>as it is written:<br>“But see, this did I find: God made men righteous but they invent<br>multitudinous contrivances” [Eccles. 7:29].",
            "Seeing his molten image having proved deceitful,<br>the human repented,<br>and conceived Seth in his image and likeness.<br>Seth conceived Enosh;<br>from them came Enoch who walked before God,<br>knowing and cognizing Him in truth.<br>As it says:<br>“And Enoch walked with God” [Gen. 5:22].<br>Generations passed until Noah’s arose,<br>the tenth in count since Adam’s.<br>He too knew God with a perfect knowledge,<br>prudence dwelling with Wisdom.<br>Thus Noah found favor in God’s eyes,<br>as it is written:<br>“And Noah found favor” [Gen. 6:8].<br>Among Noah’s three sons,<br>Shem was chosen, for he was the first born,<br>recognizing his Creator,<br>knowing and cognizing Him in faith.<br>His descendent Ever grasped hold of God’s path,<br>upheld its steps,<br>was chosen from his entire generation<br>to be singled out for fame and praise.<br>By means of a knowledge<br>complete, lucid and pure,<br>Shem and Ever comprehended the rational commandments<br>and statutes divine,<br>setting right the branches on high.<br>And they charged the multitudes<br>to walk in God’s paths.<br>The generations progressed.<br>The tenth after Noah’s<br>was distinguished by the man<br>chosen from the womb since the dawn,<br>our father Abraham.<br>He perceived a knowledge of his Creator<br>transcending his predecessors’,<br>comprehending God’s reality<br>in a manner formerly unknown.<br>He began to call upon God’s name<br>among all of the nations and kingdoms,<br>as it is written:<br>“And there he built an altar to the Lord<br>and called upon God’s name” [Gen. 12:8].<br>And it says:<br>“He planted an oak in Be‘er Sheva<br>and invoked the name of the Lord, the God of the world” [Gen. 21:33].<br>Since he took possession of the attribute of divine love,<br>his son Isaac was chosen from among all of his sons and offspring.<br>As it is written:<br>“God said to Abraham:<br>‘Do not be distressed over the boy or your handmaid;<br>whatever Sarah tells you, do as she says,<br>for it is through Isaac that your offspring will be continued’” [Gen. 21:12].<br>Isaac attained knowledge of his Creator,<br>he too exhorting his sons to walk in God’s ways,<br>as it is written:<br>“he built an altar there and invoked the Lord by name,<br>pitching there his tent” [Gen. 26:25].<br>He took divine justice as his portion.<br>When his son Jacob was born,<br>the image of the likeness of the blessed Holy One,<br>engraved on the Throne of Glory,<br>manifested itself in the world.<br>For Jacob grasped the attributes of justice and mercy<br>a path equalized and balanced,<br>so that his ways were imbued with truth<br>and the paths of peace.<br>For fourteen years<br>he studied in Ever’s school<br>and from his father Isaac<br>and his grandfather Abraham,<br>he received the knowledge of God.<br>Thus, <i>shekhinah</i>’s glory was revealed to him.<br>Then the three patriarchs formed a chariot-throne<br>for Him who rides the ancient highest heavens [Ps. 68:34].<br>They fulfilled the Teaching and commandment,<br>serving their Creator by knowing Him;<br>their worship lacking nothing.<br>“For Abraham obeyed Me and kept My charge:<br>My commandments, My laws and My teachings” [Gen. 26:5].",
            "Twelve sons were engendered by Jacob,<br>righteous and good,<br>who recognized the Creator, be He blessed,<br>and knew Him as they had learned<br>from their father Jacob.<br>From their knowledge and perceptions of the Creator,<br>they too observed the commandments:<br>“Judah said to Onan:<br>‘Join with your brother’s wife<br>and perform your levirate duty with her,<br>and provide offspring for your brother’” [Gen. 38:8].<br>So matters unfolded<br>until our father Jacob’s descent to Egypt,<br>engendering offspring,<br>twelve tribes in the likeness of that which is on high,<br>the tribes of Yah,<br>the community of Israel,<br>whose numbers came to fulfillment at seventy.",
            "After that generation,<br>they were immersed in Egypt,<br>among a people lacking comprehension,<br>whose speech was subtle and obscure<br>whose languages were different from their own.<br>Israel adopted their ways and abominations,<br>learnt their customs,<br>grew ignorant of the knowledge of God<br>inherited from their ancestors, elders, and primal progenitors.<br>Then God in His compassion,<br>sent them His beloved prophet, Moses,<br>faithful of His household.<br>He called to Moses, revealing Himself in a bush,<br>the angel Michael with <i>shekhinah</i>’s glory.<br>God charged Moses<br>to inform the people that the time had come;<br>having seen their oppression,<br>their merciful father<br>would extricate them from their imprisonment and captivity.",
            "With Moses’ own words did the process commence:<br>“Moses said to God:<br>‘When I come to the Israelites and say to them<br>“The God of your fathers has sent me to you,”<br>and they ask me “What is His name?”<br>what shall I say to them?’” [Exod. 3:13].<br>Israel’s fundamental question,<br>the essence of all mystical intentionality<br>and the mystery of faith,<br>is this very query:<br>“What is His Name?”<br>It is the desire to know its origin,<br>the manner in which the name<br>is bound to the Primal Cause.<br>In that holy place,<br>Moses received the knowledge of God,<br>learning that the divine possesses three names<br>composed of twelve letters,<br>faces within faces, ten <i>sefirot</i>,<br>existence within existences.<br>In verification of his mission,<br>God explained:<br>“Thus shall you say to the Israelites,<br>‘EHeYeH sent me to you.’”<br>Scripture further states:<br>“And God further said to Moses:<br>‘Thus shall you speak to the Israelites:<br>“YHVH, the God of your fathers,<br>the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac,<br>and the God of Jacob has sent me to you,”’”<br>placing the name EHeYeH aside<br>and commencing with YHVH,<br>adding and explicating:<br>“This shall be My name forever,<br>This is my appellation for all eternity” [Exod. 3:15].<br>And in that conversation God said:<br>“And when you have freed the people,<br>they shall worship God on this very mountain” [Exod. 3:12],<br>promising them that God would appear to them face to face,<br>and that they would see God’s glory with their very eyes.<br>To extricate some of the populace<br>from their darkness and doubt<br>concerning the veracity of Moses’ prophecy,<br>God said:<br>“Behold I will come to you in a thick cloud,<br>in order that the people might hear<br>when I speak with you<br>and so trust you ever after” [Exod. 19:9].<br>In that holy convocation<br>the people directly saw <i>shekhinah</i>’s glory,<br>viewing seven partitions of fire,<br>moving them to the fear of God and faith in His<br>goodness.<br>As soon as they heard that voice,<br>their souls almost departed from their bodies,<br>just as occurred among the nations,<br>as it says:<br>“Has any people heard the voice of God<br>speaking from amidst the fire<br>as you have and lived?” [Deut. 4:33].<br>And as it says:<br>“All the world’s kings acknowledged you,<br>for they heard the words of Your mouth” [Ps. 138:4].<br>During that holy convocation,<br>Moses and Aaron, Nadav and Avihu,<br>seventy of Israel’s elders and all of Israel<br>attained an illumination concerning God’s reality<br>and the essence of God’s glory,<br>each and every one in accord<br>with his perfection, ability, and power.<br>There were varied rungs among them,<br>some more inward, some outward,<br>some higher, some lower.",
            "From this true knowing<br>the holy Torah was revealed,<br>coming forth from an inner voice,<br>spreading forth into seventy branches,<br>the seventy “faces” of the Torah.<br>These are the multiple meanings of its verses,<br>ever changing and transmuting in every direction:<br>from pure to impure,<br>forbidden to permitted,<br>ritually fit to ritually disqualified,<br>each parallel to its opposite<br>containing within themselves the ability<br>to declare a given reptile both pure and impure.",
            "From that moment the prophets<br>who would arise in every generation<br>received their prophecies,<br>and the sages who in the future<br>would ascend to greatness<br>received the fundamentals<br>of their teachings, rulings, and debates.<br>As it is written:<br>“From the beginning, I did not speak in secret;<br>From the time anything existed, I was there.<br>And now the Lord God has sent me,<br>endowed with His spirit” [Isa. 48:16].<br>And it is also said:<br>“The Lord spoke all these words<br>to your entire congregation<br>on the mountain, from amid the fire, cloud, and mist,<br>a great voice that did not cease” [Deut. 5:19].",
            "From that period until now,<br>there never ceased to be a generation of Israel<br>to which the heritage of Wisdom,<br>that is the knowledge of the divine Name,<br>was transmitted through the tradition of Oral Torah.<br>For our master Moses,<br>when death drew near<br>and the transmission of Wisdom was concealed from him,<br>handed this wisdom to Joshua,<br>as it is written:<br>“Joshua the son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom,<br>for Moses had placed his hands upon him” [Deut. 34:9].<br>And Joshua transmitted it to the elders,<br>who sustained their generation<br>and were Israel’s leaders,<br>praying for them during periods of trouble.<br>All Israel obeyed them<br>and were directed by their instruction,<br>as it is written:<br>“Israel served the Lord during the lifetime of Joshua<br>and the lifetime of the elders who lived on after Joshua” [Josh. 24:31].<br>And the elders transmitted to the prophets.<br>From the prophets it was given to the Men of the Great Assembly:<br>Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, Mordecai, Zerubavel and Ezra,<br>the last among them being Simon the Righteous.<br>Afterwards, this wisdom came to the masters of the Mishnah.<br>At the hour of his death,<br>R. Judah the Prince transmitted the tradition of wisdom<br>to his son Simon.<br>Thus R. Akiba and his companions entered the Garden.<br>And when R. Yohanan b. Zakkai and R. Eliezer b.

            "Since then God’s Temple has been destroyed<br>and the numbers of sages has dwindled,<br>wisemen have ceased<br>and the pious and saints<br>for whose sake miracles were wrought<br>are no more.<br>The exile continues to worsen<br>and our sufferings proceed,<br>indeed undergoing constant renewal,<br>there being neither anyone to impart knowledge<br>nor comprehend tradition.<br>And thus this wisdom ceased from Israel.<br>Wisdom was lost and with it Torah.<br>No one knew its interpretation and subtleties,<br>exegesis and the reasons for its commandments.<br>For a powerful connection exists between this wisdom<br>and the commandments’ meanings,<br>the Torah’s interpretation and the words of tradition,<br>many passages of Scripture being based upon it.",
            "Instead, interpreters arose<br>possessing neither wisdom nor insight,<br>whether they turned either towards the right or the left.<br>They turned words of holiness into profanity,<br>diminishing Scripture<br>adding, subtracting, enhancing,<br>interpreting passages spoken through the holy spirit,<br>from a quarry of sacred gems,<br>in terms never to be entertained by human<br>consciousness,<br>let alone spoken,<br>and how much more so transcribed in a book.<br>I call such interpreters<br>those who<br>“overturn the words of the living God, the Lord of Hosts” [Jer. 23:36].<br>Concerning this dual cessation of wisdom<br>and its nullification in Israel,<br>the prophet, trembling, devastated, and sighing, said:<br>“Many are the days which will pass in Israel<br>without the God of truth and without instruction” [Isa. 30:21].<br>By the phrase “without the God of truth”<br>he referred to the interruption in the knowledge of God in Israel.<br>“Without instruction”<br>designates that on account of this negative situation<br>we lack clarity<br>concerning the reasons for the Torah’s commandments<br>and its mysteries.<br>Just as it is with the words of Torah and Scripture,<br>so is it with the words of our sages of blessed memory,<br>who expounded upon this wisdom<br>in their homiletic compendia and narratives<br>in the form of parables and ciphers,<br>so as to hide these matters and conceal them.<br>They scattered one here and one there,<br>so as to hide their place.<br>When encountering them,<br>a person does not sense their inner meaning<br>but instead takes them at their face value.<br>He does not contemplate<br>the inner dimensions of their details,<br>pays no heed,<br>lacks the knowledge or insight to say:<br>“How is it possible for our sages to have written such things,<br>to have put them into writing in a book,<br>unless a delightful treasure is hidden and concealed<br>within them?”",

            "The third group,<br>those who receive <i>shekhinah</i>,<br>who possess a portion in God’s Torah<br>and remember it well,<br>the true wise men of Israel<br>who have revealed its secrets<br>and hidden mysteries,<br>who have brought forth its occult depths<br>through wisdom’s path and knowledge,<br>have interpreted the entire text<br>with that pithy principle<br>enunciated by our sages in the tractate on Oaths:<br>“Every Solomon mentioned in the Song of Songs is holy,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> I.e., a name of God.</i><br>referring to Him who is the possessor of peace,<br>save one:<br>‘I have my own vineyard: You may have the thousand O Solomon …’ [Cant. 8:12].”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> b. <i>Shavu‘ot</i> 35b.</i><br>Our sages state further in Sanhedrin,<br>the chapter called “Portion”:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> The final chapter of the Talmudic tractate Sanhedrin.</i><br>“Anyone who recites a verse of the Song of Songs<br>treating it as a mere song,<br>brings evil into the world.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> b. <i>Sanhedrin</i> 101a.</i><br>In the tractate Hands<br>R.

            "However, I must commence with three fundamental principles, in order to instruct you and provide your understanding with illumination.",
            "The first principle serves to inform you that Solomon wrote this book in his old age,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Following the view of R. Ḥiyya the Great in Cant. Rabbah. 1:10.</i> inspired by the holy spirit. He referred to God’s name as Solomon, like his own name. For we have found God designated as “Peace,” as in Judges 6:24: “Gideon built an altar there and called it “the Lord of Peace.” The name possesses two usages, one revealed, the second esoteric.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Designating God as Solomon <i>(Shelomo=Shalom)</i> refers especially to <i>tiferet</i>, the sixth of the ten <i>sefirot</i>, the central “male” element of the Godhead, the aspect of divinity understood by the kabbalists as the bridegroom of the Song of Songs.</i> Through it Solomon glimpsed all that would occur in the future with regard to the construction of the Temples and Israel’s exiles. He concealed the mention of the exile in an allusive manner for it was not to be mentioned in poetic language. His first words contained hidden within them wondrous songs, and an awesome righteousness,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> “Righteousness” for the kabbalist can be a designation of <i>shekhinah</i>, who is also God’s throne. See Prov. 25:5, etc. The passage here is obscure.</i> making mention of the construction of God’s throne, its appearance, height, work, and shape and the number of steps <i>[ma‘alot</i>] which it possessed. He made mention of all of the events which would befall Israel from the Exodus, at which time they attained the appellation of God’s people. For God’s name is united with His people until the seventh millennium, the day which is entirely Shabbat and rest eternal. At the conclusion he concealed, indeed sealed, the work with an allusion to the exile’s end and the fact that Israel would hold fast to their Torah and stand firm in faith in every location, even when suffering from intensified destruction and evil decrees.",
            "Solomon called it the Song of Songs, a song composed in the form of an allegorical parable replete with inner meaning. A person must thus interpret the song, establishing upon its foundations. But he must understand that it is filled with many elements provided for the sake of the narrational continuity of the allegory and the context of its imagery, rather than for any other purpose or function. For example, let me quote one verse from this book. It states: “Let him kiss me with the kisses …” [Cant. 1:2]. The kiss symbolizes the soul’s adhesion to God, as we will explain. The verse further states “the kisses of his mouth.” There is no additional meaning here. But having analogized the soul’s adhesion to God with a kiss, the verse is constrained to state “the kisses of his mouth” in order to tie the allegorical figure to its context. Thus one of the wise men of the generation has already written. Know that there are parables in this work whose details should in no manner undergo exegesis, such as: “the buds appear in the land, the time of pruning has come, the song of the turtledove is heard in our land” [Cant. 2:12]. We are not to minutely examine such and similar texts. Rather, we are simply to interpret it as an allegorical figure referring to the efflorescence of the coming days of release, while the winter rains refer to departing days of exile. Similarly: “Your belly is a heap of wheat” [Cant. 7:3–4]; and “Your breasts are like twin gazelles” [Cant. 4:5]. Neither through the exercise of rational nor traditional means of exegesis should you seek out their detailed meaning, for you will mire your mind in a multitude of words, vanities, and obstacles galore: “Hear this and accept it” [Job 5:27].",
            "The second principle serves to inform you with words truly reliable that this text possesses words whose meaning is not revealed by any book, yet which serve as the foundation of its allegory and edifice. Among them are those whose meaning we have received from tradition; others have been found scattered in the homiletic dicta and exegetic texts of our sages, deep wells in which no drop of water is wasted. All of their words possess an inner heart free of an obstructive husk.",
            "We have been taught by tradition that the following phrases refer to divine Wisdom:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ḥokhmah</i>, the second of the ten <i>sefirot</i>.</i> “of wood from Lebanon” [Cant. 3:9], “the scent of Lebanon” [Cant. 4:11], “Come with me from Lebanon” [Cant. 4:8], “flowing streams from Lebanon” [Cant. 4:15]. This too was the intention of our sages when they interpreted “of wood from Lebanon” [Cant. 3:9] as referring to the counsel of Torah, which is refined [<i>ha-melubbenet</i>] in its words. The Aramaic translation also took this tact “From this goodly mountain and Lebanon” as “that goodly mountain and sanctuary” [Deut. 3:25].",
            "We have further received from tradition that “your love is more delightful than wine” [Cant. 1:2] and “I will let you drink of the spiced wine” [Cant. 8:2] also symbolize divine Wisdom. So too, we have discovered that the number seventy designates the seventy divine names emanated from Wisdom. For Wisdom’s numerical equivalent is seventy-three; the meaning of the remaining three is well-established.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Obscure. He may be referring to a tripartite division of <i>keter</i>, the first <i>sefirah</i>, related to a notion of three primal flashes of light (<i>tzaḥtzeḥot</i>) that precede the <i>sefirot</i>.</i> All that which we have mentioned is support and aid for this matter in addition to what has been received from tradition. Similarly, the terminology of “perfume” or “spice” as in “all choice perfumes” [Cant. 4:14], “to the bed of spices” [Cant. 6:2], “than any spice” [Cant. 4:10], “that its perfume might spread” [Cant. 4:16], and “to the mountain of spices” [Cant. 8:14] figure Wisdom. For it constitutes the beginning of being; from the point of Wisdom commences the propagation and expansion of scent.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Reaḥ or scent is a metaphoric figure for the vivifying outflow of emanational energy, wafting forth from ḥ<i>okhmah</i> through the sefirotic world.</i>",
            "Similarly, tradition imparts that the following figure the glory of the <i>shekhinah</i>: “like the apple among the forest’s trees” [Cant. 2:3]; “your breath is like apples’ fragrance” [Cant. 7:9]; “refresh me with apples” [Cant. 2:5]; and “under the apple tree I aroused you” [Cant. 8:5]. This figure derives from the change of the apple’s cover from green to red to white, like the appearance of the rainbow within the cloud.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Ezek. 1:28.</i> The apple also figures the two cherubim, as it states in the tractate <i>Shabbat</i>: “‘Like the scent of a field blessed by God’ [Gen. 27:27]. R. Yehudah states in the name of Rav: ‘Like the scent of a field of apple trees.’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> b. <i>Ta ‘anit</i> 29b.</i>",
            "“The shepherd among the lilies” [Cant. 6:3], “hedged about by lilies” [Cant. 7:3], “a lily of the valleys” [Cant. 2:1], and “to gather lilies” [Cant. 6:2] refer to that plant known as “lidi,” which possesses six leaves and figures the six supernal boundaries.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> The <i>sefirot</i> from <i>ḥesed</i> to <i>yesod</i>.</i> On the other hand, “to browse in the gardens” [Cant. 6:2], “who lingers in the garden” [Cant. 8:13], “the garden spring” [Cant. 4:15], and “a garden locked” [Cant. 4:12] refer to the <i>shekhinah</i>, as we will explain further on.",
            "The third principle comes to inform you briefly concerning the principles of Kabbalah inherent in these verses which serve as the pillar upon which all things rely, the peg upon which they hang, so that the interpretation of this book might be absorbed like water, directing your mind in the proper path.",
            "The wise man stated in an allegorical parable:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> From here through the end of the introduction R. Ezra is explicating Job 28, which he employs to introduce sefirotic discourse.</i><br>There is a mine for silver,<br>And a place where gold is refined,<br>Iron is taken out of the earth,<br>And copper smelted from the rock [Job 28:1–2].<br>He mentions the four metals smelted from the rock, corresponding to the four types of elements as manifest in a human: white, red, green, and black biles. Similarly, every living thing, whether sentient or non-sentient, draws its life from the primary spiritual principles which exist among the ten <i>sefirot</i>. These are the primal progenitors of all generated things. When the verse enumerates the four terrestrial elements: silver, gold, iron, and copper, it is alluding to the four primary elements, informing us that they possess a place of origin.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Silver is <i>ḥesed</i>; gold is <i>din</i>; copper is <i>tiferet</i>; and iron is <i>malkhut</i>.</i>",
            "The verse furthermore explicates and designates the source of their origin: “He sets bounds for darkness” [Job 28:3]. It is common knowledge that darkness designates absolute nullity.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> <i>Afisah</i> or nullity designates the highest <i>sefirah</i>, usually described in negative terms. Here that most primordial seed of existence is not clearly separated from <i>Eyn Sof</i>, the primordial boundless “darkness” of the unknown and unknowable God.</i> Under no circumstances can nullity be described with the terminology of formation [<i>yetzirah</i>] but rather that of creation [<i>beriah</i>]. In this context creation designates the manner in which God differentiated another principle and rung of emanation from darkness, which in itself lacks boundary or end. In stating “He sets bounds for darkness,” the intention is that God set a boundary to darkness, infixing within it border and limit. “To, every limit man probes” [Job 28:3]. The possibility of speculative analysis inheres within each and every quality and being existing by the creative power of that nullity. That is to say, after these forces were actualized from their potential state, He made them into qualities and instruments that are subject to measure and hence to inquiry. For this reason Scripture speaks of darkness in terms of creation, and the light which existed within the creative capacity of darkness in terms of formation, as it says: “He forms light and creates darkness” [Isa. 45:7]. This is also the meaning of: “He draws mysteries out of the darkness, and brings obscurities into light” [Job 12:22]. Nullity is designated as darkness and obscurity. Inherent within its creative power were light and other entities. This is further the meaning of: “rocks in deepest darkness” [Job 28:3]. Understand this, for it comprises a fundamental principle.",
            "The verse further states: “A stream sprang forth from a dwelling-place, forgotten by wayfarers, destitute of men, far removed” [Job 28:4]. That is to say, the source of the channel watering all things was hidden and sealed. The figure of the stream refers to the path of Transcendent Wisdom. There was therefore neither modality nor place to water Lebanon’s trees or its planted cedars. But, Scripture says, “a stream sprang forth” from the place from which it was appropriate to flow. Due to the extraordinary mysteriousness of that place from which the stream flowed, it was parabolically and with poetic richness described as being “forgotten by wayfarers, destitute of men, far removed” [Job 28:4].",
            "The text further states: “Earth, out of which food grows, is changed below as if into fire. Its rocks are a source of sapphires; it contains gold dust too” [Job 28:5–6]. That locus which is the origin of existence, the awakening of desire, is designated as the “earth.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> In the sense of a divine “ground of being.” The passage refers to <i>keter</i>, the primal will of God.</i> Providing sustenance for all things, it is the source of life, supplying the needs of the upper and lower worlds. “[It] is changed below as if into fire“: the figure refers to its wondrous illumination and pure light, transcending all likeness and comparison.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> The light flowing forth from <i>keter</i>, the channel of infinite divine energy.</i>",

            "“No bird of prey knows the path to it, the falcon’s eye has not gazed upon it” [Job 28:7].

For “the falcon’s eye has not gazed upon it” until the time of favor.",
            "“Man sets his hand against the flinty rock and overturns mountains by the roots” [Job 28:9].

            "“He carves out channels through rock; His eyes behold every precious thing” [Job 28:10]. Channels [<i>ye ‘orim</i>] refers to the totality of all of the sefirotic existences [<i>havayot</i>] and is derived from “light” [<i>‘or</i>] as in “the waters [=lights] lift up their voices [Ps. 93:3].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Here he calls upon an ancient connection between the Hebrew and Aramaic words for “light” and “water.”</i> These primordial existences are implied by the term “water” in the Biblical account of creation, as it is written: “And the spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters” [Gen. 1:2]. After all of these channels flowed forth, “his eyes beheld every precious thing.”",
            "Among the phenomena emanated on the first day were ten entities commingled one with the other: heaven and earth; primordial chaos;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Primordial chaos is twofold: <i>tohu va-vohu</i>.</i> light and darkness; wind and water; and the quality of day and the quality of night.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> v. <i>Hagigah</i> 12a. The kabbalists associate this list with the ten <i>sefirot</i>.</i> This is the intent of “He dams up the sources of the streams” [Job 28:11]. Since these ten entities were considered as one, the cosmos being in the inchoate state of water intermixed with water, God dammed those watery channels, separating the waters with the command: “Let there be an expanse in the midst of the water …” [Gen 1:6]. Thus the verse continues, “from its hiddenness He brought forth light.” The hiddenness of transcendent Wisdom brought forth light.",
            "“Whence [<i>me-ayin</i>] can Wisdom be found?” [Job 28:12]. This Wisdom itself derives from Nought [<i>ayin</i>], the primordial Nought, no mortal knowing its value [<i>‘erkah</i>] which here means its order and array. That is to say, no one knows how to order the primal existences that are situated within her or how to know its characteristics. As it is written: “Who like Me can announce, can foretell it—and match Me thereby? Even as I told the future to an ancient people …” [Isa. 44:7]. “[For Wisdom] can not be found in the land of the living” [Job 28:13]. Even the angels do not know it. Thus the text states figuratively: “The deep says: ‘It is not in me.’ The sea says: ‘I do not have it’” [Job 28:14]. Similarly we find “But whence does wisdom come?” [Job 28:20] and “it is hidden from the eyes of all of the living” [Job 28:21], from them whose lives are eternal. “Concealed from all the fowl of heaven”—the ministering angels.",
            "“<i>Abaddon</i> and death say” [Job 28:22]—this is primal void, whence comes the emanation of all of the existences. “God understands its way” [Job 28:23]—by meditating upon it. It traced and emanated the four primal elements, these being “For He sees to the ends of the earth, observes all that is beneath the heavens, when he fixed the weight of the winds, set the measure of the waters” [Job 28:24].",
            "“Then He saw and gauged it” [Job 28:27]—gazing upon Purity of Thought [<i>keter</i>], just as a man considering an enterprise first examines it within his heart and then begins to undertake it. Thus our sages say: “the thought of the righteous preceded all.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Bereshit Rabbah 1:5.

Rather God, be He praised, brought the existences into being, arrayed them in order, transformed them into a structure, after combining, measuring, and transposing the twenty-two letters, binding each and every one to its colleague, so that they paralleled one another. “And He probed it”: He affixed boundary to the sefirotic qualities, rendered them accessible to probing, although they in principle possessed no boundary from their beginning.",

Because their origin is from it, it provides the essence of their sustenance. The remaining <i>sefirot</i> possess but one request, toward which the entirety of their desire is directed.

Every nation heard the Word, and that is the “great voice that did not cease” [Deut. 5:19]. All this is compared to a hammer, whose power is one but which fragments the rock into multiple pieces. So the totality of all is five voices, their specification is seven, except for the innermost voice, parallel to the singular nation. Of this it says: “A great voice that did not cease.” But the one who refers to ten voices holds fast to the highest total, that of the ten <i>sefirot</i>. All these lead in the same direction, having been “given by a single shepherd” [Eccles. 12:11]."

So our sages have said: “R. Joshua of Sikhnin said in the name of R. Levi: ‘When the Holy One, blessed be He, told Moses “Make Me a sanctuary that I might dwell among you,” he was to erect four poles and stretch out the tabernacle upon them. This teaches that the Holy One showed him red fire, green fire, black fire, and white fire. He said to him: “follow the patterns … that are being shown to you on the mountain” [Exod. 25:40].’<br>“R. Berechyah said: ‘This can be likened in a parable to a king who had a wonderful garment made of pearls. He said to his retainer: “Make me another like this one.” The retainer said to him: “My lord king, can I really make one like it?” The king said: “I in accord with my glory, you in accord with your own material.” Similarly, our teacher Moses said to God: “Can I construct something like these?” God said: “In accord with their patterns, using blue, purple, and crimson yarns and fine linen.’”<br>“Thus is the entire world included within the construction of the sanctuary. Concerning the world it is written: ‘God created the heavens and the earth’ [Gen. 1:1] and ‘He stretches the heavens out like a curtain’ [Ps. 104:2]. The Tabernacle contained goat skins for its tent. On the second day it is written: ‘Let there be an expanse in the midst of the water, separating water from water’ [Gen. 1:6]. Concerning the tabernacle it states: ‘the curtain shall serve as a partition between the Holy and the Holy of Holies’ [Exod. 26:33]. On the third day of creation, ‘Let the waters under the sky be gathered into one area …’ [Gen. 1:9]. Concerning the sanctuary: ‘You shall make a brass basin’ [Exod. 30:18]. On the fourth day: ‘Let there be luminaries in the expanse of the sky’ [Gen. 1:14] while in the tabernacle there was the candelabrum of pure gold. On the fifth day of creation: ‘… and birds that fly above the earth’ [Gen. 1:20] while in the Sanctuary: ‘Let there be cherubim with outstretched wings’ [Exod. 25:20]. Humanity was created on the sixth day. Concerning the sanctuary it states: ‘Bring forward Aaron your brother’ [Exod. 28:1]. On the seventh day: ‘The heaven and the earth were completed’ [Gen. 2:1]. Concerning the tabernacle: ‘Thus was completed all of the work of the Tabernacle …’ [Exod. 39:32]. Concerning the work of Creation, it is written: ‘God blessed them’ [Gen. 1:33] and concerning the construction of the tabernacle: ‘Moses blessed them …’ [Exod. 39:43]. On the seventh day it states: ‘On the seventh day God finished the work that He had been doing’ [Gen. 2:2], concerning the tabernacle: ‘On the day which Moses completed …’ [Num. 7:1].

The Holy One, blessed be He, enwrapped Himself as in a robe, and radiated His luster from one end of the world to the other.” The robe designates the invocation of the emanation of wisdom which encompasses the totality of all things. The act of enwrapping conveys that He received radiance from that emanational outflow and literally sparked forth light. This is furthermore the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer the Great who said:<br>Whence were the heavens created? He took from the light of His garment; He wrapped Himself as in a robe. The light extended outwards, as it says: “wrapped in a robe of light, You spread the heavens like a tent cloth” [Ps. 104:2]. Whence was the earth created?

Just as in these cases, there is no diminution in His capacity, so too there is no denigration if He does not emanate something from nothing, but rather uses a primal element.

                    "We should interpret each and every commandment in accord with our path, determining from which <i>sefirah</i> it derives and finding allusion to all of the reasons for the commandments which are not explicitly stated in the Torah. The reasons of many precepts are indeed explicated, an example being the law concerning the first born: “When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the Lord slew every first-born in the land of Egypt, the first-born of man and beast. Therefore I sacrifice to the Lord every first male issue of the womb, but redeem every first-born among my sons” [Exod. 13:15]. A similar case is that of tithes: “You shall consume the tithes of your new grain … before the Lord” which concludes “so that you might learn to revere the Lord your God forever” [Deut. 14:23]. Like these are many other commandments whose meaning is explained. But there are many whose purpose are not explicated, such as the reason for sacrifice, the Sabbatical year and Jubilee, circumcision, the blowing of the ram’s horn at New Year’s, forbidden acts of sexual union, oaths, vows and phylacteries, ritual fringes, Naziriteship, the palmfrond and citron, the ban on the consumption of the produce of fruit-bearing trees during their first three harvest years, the mixing of seeds in a field, the sacrifice of the red heifer, and many others, excluding those whose meaning is hinted at where they are mentioned.",
                    "You should realize that all of the precepts depend upon two fundamental principles: the positive and negative commandments. The positive commandments are born of the quality of remembrance [<i>zakhor</i>]; the negative commandments of the quality of observance [<i>shamor</i>]. It is also well known that remembrance and observance correspond to two of the attributes of the Holy One, blessed be He. Consequently, an individual who performs the command of his master and fulfills it, does so as a consequence of the quality of love. This constitutes the highest degree [of service] and the most excellent virtue, and corresponds to the category of positive commandments. An individual who desists from performing a deed out of fear of his master, does so as a consequence of the quality of awe. This stands on a lower rung than the quality of love, just as negative commandments occupy a gradation lower than the positive. For the person who fulfills the command of his master with his body and his possessions is not to be likened to one who is scrupulous about desisting from evil out of fear of him. Thus our Sages say: “Concerning what situation were these matters related? Concerning negative commandments. That is to say that the transgressor is smitten with forty lashes. However, with respect to positive commandments, such as the case when they instruct him to construct a Sukkah but he does not build it, or take a palm frond but he does not do so, they smite him until his soul departs his body.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">109</sup><i class=\"footnote\">b. <i>Ketubot</i> 86a.

                    "All of the above derives from the principles of “remembrance” and “observance,” for the quality of remembrance occupies a gradation higher than that of observance and the branches which derive from it are in its likeness. Since Abraham our father took divine love as his portion, corresponding to remembrance, and he knew God’s name with a true and real knowledge, the Omnipresent One called him “My lover.” Nor is the [attainment of the] quality of love possible save through perfect knowledge. Thus one finds that many principles of the negative commandments are derived from the positive. For the quality of love exists within the quality of awe, since awe derives from love and is thus included within it.",
                    "You should know that a human being, by nature and the process of generation, contains and is impressed with the stamp of these two qualities, that is to say the essential force of the positive and negative commandments, that is water and fire, the former at his right hand, the latter at his left.

Concerning this David said: “I am ever mindful of the Lord’s presence; He is at my right hand, I shall never be shaken” [Ps. 16:8]. “I shall not be shaken”: I shall never neglect, even for an instant, that inclination towards the good that stands at my right hand.",
                    "Since these two qualities, the inclination to the good and the inclination to evil, which correspond to the positive and negative commandments, are impressed upon human nature, the Torah was given with positive and negative commandments to direct an individual and habituate him towards positive qualities. The inclination towards evil would be drawn after the good and annihilated within it. Concerning this our sages said: “‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart’ [Deut. 6:5]—with your two inclinations, towards good and evil.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">111</sup><i class=\"footnote\">b. <i>Berakhot</i> 54a.</i> This is the purpose of the commandments, the acts of worship, prayers, and fasting. They serve to subjugate the evil inclination so that it might be rendered subordinate to the impulse towards good. Thus the body, whose foundation is dust and nature evil and which descends below, will be drawn after the faculty of the soul, whose foundation is life, whose nature is wholly for the good and ascends upwards.

The <i>shekhinah</i>’s fence is the cherubim, the plants are the seventy nations, the trees are the angels. All these are supplied by that spring which proceeds from Wisdom’s paradise, within which souls flower in joy. It flows forth without ceasing either day or night; on its account the world is sustained. As our sages said in tractate Yoma:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">121</sup><i class=\"footnote\">b. <i>Yoma</i> 38b.</i> “On account of the righteous one is the world created and sustained,” as it says: “The righteous one is the world’s foundation” [Prov. 10:25].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">122</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Zaddik</i> or “the righteous” is <i>yesod</i>, the source of sefirotic energy as it flows into the <i>shekhinah</i>.</i> Our sages also said concerning this: “The circumference of the tree of life is a journey of five hundred years and all of the waters of creation are divided forth from it.” Rabbi Yehudah said: “It is not the circumference of its bough, but its trunk that constitutes a journey of five hundred years.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">123</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis Rabbah 15:7.</i><br>“A river goes forth from Eden to water the garden” [Gen. 2:10]. The garden constitutes the beginning of the differentiated universe. As it says: “from there it divides and becomes four branches” [ibid.]. The verse is in present tense, the process is eternal. Thus it says: “There is a river whose streams gladden God’s city, the holy dwelling-place of the Most High” [Ps. 46:5]. And “You make springs gush forth in torrents; they make their way between the hills, giving drink to all the wild beasts” [Ps. 104:10–11].<br>Concerning this spring, it states: “a garden spring, a well of fresh water, flowing streams from Lebanon” [Cant. 4:15]. Our Sages of blessed memory said: “‘a garden spring’: this is Jacob who is a spring for the garden. ‘A well of fresh water’: this is Isaac. ‘Flowing streams’: this is Abraham.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">124</sup><i class=\"footnote\">No such interpretation is found in the extant rabbinic sources.

This was the intent of the princes of Israel when they offered twelve goats, twelve rams, twelve lambs for a burnt offering, and twelve billy goats for a sin offering when the altar was consecrated. Everything is transmuted into spirit via the sefirotic channels which number twelve. And twenty-four bullocks were offered as sacrifices of well being, corresponding to the power of the left side of divinity, the aspect of Might, which is twenty-four [<span dir=\"rtl\">ד״כ</span>], as it is written: “I will lay carbuncles [<i>kadkod</i>] as your foundation stones” [Isa. 54:12]. This alludes to the twenty-four permutations of the divine name <i>Adonai</i>. The sacrifices of well-being constituted sixty rams, sixty billy goats, and sixty yearling lambs [Num. 7:88]. These correspond to the sixty steps, the sixty heroes [Cant. 3:7], and the three-score queens [Cant. 6:8]. The meaning of a pleasing [<i>niḥoaḥ</i>] aroma is that of descent, the Aramaic of descent [<i>yarad</i>] being <i>naḥat</i>. Through the sacrifice, divine spirit descends and the force of holiness unites and is drawn into close continguity within the channels. For this reason, sacrifice is designated <i>korban</i>. This is the meaning of “Let my beloved come to his garden and enjoy its luscious fruits.”"

As it is written: “raising from their thrones, all of the kings of the nations” [Isa. 14:9]. The three-year old ram represents the Medeans, these being the kings of Assyria, Cyrus and Darius. As it is written: “They joyfully celebrated the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days, for the Lord had given them cause for joy by inclining the heart of the Assyrian king toward them so as to give them the support in the work of the House of God, the God of Israel” [Ezra 6:22].

                    "Israel underwent subjugation to these nations in accord with the following order. Senacherib, king of Assyria, who was also king of Medea, exiled the ten tribes. “He settled them in Halah, along the Habor [and] the river Gozan, and in the towns of Media” [II Kings 18:11]. Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, at the appointed time, exiled Judah and Benjamin. Isaiah the prophet forecast the downfall of Babylon by the hands of the Medeans, just as he forecasted Cyrus’ command for Israel’s manumission. “Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, who do not value silver or delight in gold” [Isa. 13:17]. At the prophecy’s conclusion he states: “And when the Lord has given you rest from your sorrow and trouble, and from the hard service that you were made to serve, you shall recite this song of scorn over the king of Babylon” [Isa. 14:3–4]. Then follows the song’s content until it comes to its conclusion “I will rise up against them … and will wipe out of Babylon name and remnant, kith and kin …” [Isa. 14:22]. Isaiah similarly prophesied regarding Cyrus’ decree concerning Israel: “So says the Lord to Cyrus His anointed, whose right hand I strengthened” [Isa. 45:1], “He will build my city” [Isa. 45:13]. We find similarly in Daniel [5:30–6:1]: “During that very night Belshazzar the King was killed and Darius the Mede received the kingdom.” He reigned one year to complete the seventy years apportioned to the sovereignty of Babylon.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">143</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Megillah 12a.</i> During the first year of Cyrus’ reign, the decree concerning Israel was issued and Israel came under the jurisdiction of the kingdom of Medea. Afterwards, the kingdom of Greece arose, that is, Alexander the Macedonian, the three-year old goat and Daniel’s <i>tzfir ‘izim</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">144</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See p. 96 above.</i> He fought with the ram [Dan. 8:7], these being the kings of Medea, Darius the Persian, putting him to the sword, as it is written: “There was no one to rescue the ram from his power” [Dan. 8:7]. Israel, both those in Babylon and those in Jerusalem during the period of the second Temple, came under the rule of the king of Greece. The rule of the kings of Greece lasted one hundred and eighty years, as it states in the tractate <i>Avodah Zarah</i> [9a]. At that time war broke out between Greece and Rome, as our sages taught in <i>Avodah Zarah</i> [8b]: “The Romans engaged in thirty-two battles with Greeks and were not able to overcome them until Israel allied itself with Rome.” Israel revolted against the Greeks during the period of the second Temple, coming under Roman authority and keeping faithful alliance with them for twenty-six years. Then the Romans turned against them, destroyed the second Temple, and the kingdom of Greece was subjugated by the Romans. Nor will the son of David come until the dominion of the kingdom of Rome spreads over the entire world for nine months, just as the other three kingdoms spread over the entire world. For this reason, our sages ordained the drinking of four cups of wine,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">145</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On the eve of Passover, celebrating the first redemption but anticipating the last.</i> corresponding to the four terms for redemption appearing in the pericope <i>Va‘era</i> [Exod. 6:6–7], conveying the glad tidings to Israel that they will go forth from their subjugation to the four kingdoms.",
                    "I have written all of this because I have seen an interpretation in Genesis Rabbah in which the three-year old goat is correlated with the kingdom of Greece, with the two-horned ram appearing in Daniel [8:3] brought as corroborating evidence. This seems to me to be either a mistake or a case of scribal error, for it is clearly stated in Daniel that the two-horned ram represents the kings of Medea and Persia.",
                    "I have also seen someone dispute the words of our Sages and state that the fourth beast shown to Daniel represents the kingdom of Ishmael, for they have expanded throughout the majority of the inhabited world, their kingdom being great and widespread. They find it difficult to refer to Greece [and Rome] as representing two kingdoms when they really are one nation. Thus it states: “the offspring of Greece [<i>Yavan</i>] are Elisha, Tarshish and the Kittim” [Gen. 10:4]. The Kittim are the Romans.

This is one of several such lists of primordial entities to be found in rabbinic sources.</i><br>And thus [Gen. 1:2 states]: “The world was chaotic, empty”: Chaos is an entity lacking all form; but primal Emptiness enclothed that chaos, until it traced a tracing finer than spirit. “Darkness was upon the face of the deep”: The depth of the supernal heights, the depth below.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">163</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The depth above: <i>omek rom</i> = <i>keter; omek tahat</i> = <i>malkhut</i>.

He drew forth the effluence of the attribute of Day to daytime, the attribute of Night to nighttime. “And there was one day” [Gen. 1:5] all remained unified, in all of this the primal essence came to manifestation. Another interpretation: “There was evening”: the speculum that does not shine. “There was morning”: the speculum which does shine. “One day”: unique and unified in His names.",
                    "[Ps. 104:3]: “Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters” [Gen. 1:6] parallels: “Who lays the beams of Your Upper chambers in the waters.”<br>“Let there be a firmament”: let the firmament expand into the midst of the waters, like the expansion of the soul into form. On the second day, God created the boundaries of space. For this reason, Scripture did not state “it was good” on the second day. For the work of the divine attribute of goodness remained incomplete. Such is the meaning of: “Let the firmament divide the waters from the waters.” The basic act of separation is this division into two: the upper waters and the lower waters. The upper waters are allegorically designated as male: the lower waters as female. This division works out in multifarious details. Consequently, Scripture states: “He builds His upper chambers in the heaven” [Amos 9:6]. For they are constructed as rungs upon rungs, as it is written: “For one higher above the higher, watches” [Eccles. 5:7]. All of these entities are traced, one within the other, each encompassing the other. Thus half of the waters are on high, half are below. So it is said: “Just as the <i>shekhinah</i> is above, is the <i>shekhinah</i> below.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">166</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This quotation is not found in the extant rabbinic sources.</i><br>Corresponding to this matter there are eighteen thousand worlds.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">167</sup><i class=\"footnote\">b. <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 3b.</i> As David the King states: “God’s chariots are myriads, even thousands upon thousands” [Ps. 68:18]. Having stipulated that God’s chariots are myriads, that is twenty thousand worlds, corresponding to ten <i>sefirot</i> above and ten below, he subtracts two thousand from their number, for they are the nought. All of the above is true. The worlds number twenty thousand. But two thousand are not included in the count, for they are Nought. Each and every world consists of a thousand generations. There are consequently eighteen thousand worlds. The primal essences originate in the mystery of Wisdom and its Cause. For this reason, it is fitting that the phrase “God said” appears but nine times in the narrative of Creation. The tenth is an allusion to the Nought. It appears in the phrase “In the beginning.” It is proper that it not be enunciated.<br>“Who makes the clouds His riding-mount”: The total of divisions wrought in the upper waters is seventy, excepting that at the center, which makes them seventy-one. Facing them are the lower waters, stamped in their image yet considered but one, leading to a total of seventy-two.

Actually there are six directions, each of them multiplied by ten. That is why “it was good” is said six times in the chapter on creation. This too is why Scripture speaks of “sixty queens” [Cant. 6:1] and “sixty warriors surround it” [Cant. 3:7]. All of this refers to a single matter, as we are to explain. Counting the seventh [central] direction also as ten, they make up seventy. Adding the innermost spiritual direction they are seventy-one. This is the totality of distinctions made on the second day.<br>Each setting of limits is in fact a division of space. Thus it says of man’s creation that in the second hour He “limited” him. This is like a person who is building up a ruined place; he needs to trace out where he will put the upper stories and the chambers. The building is completed by means of these divisions. That is why division exists.<br>“He walks upon the wings of the winds”: The blessed Holy One is revealed in and is raised up through the world. His footsteps are known through those attributes, just as the soul’s action is revealed through the body. This is the meaning of “God called the firmament heaven” [Gen. 1:5]. All the names are included in the word “heaven.” Thus Scripture says: “And you hear, O heaven” [II Chron. 6:27], “the Lord, God of heaven” [Neh. 1:8], “He who rides in heaven” [Deut. 33:26].",

This is the meaning of “where the birds make their nests” [Ps. 104:17]. “The high mountains are for the mountain-goats; the boulders are hiding-places for rabbits” [Ps. 104:18].

These are “the young lions roar for prey, asking of God their food” [Ps. 104:21]. This means to draw it forth to them and lead them, so that which they are appointed over might exist. Of this it is also said: “She rises while it is yet night, giving food to her household and portions to her maidservants” [Prov. 31:15].",

This is the one spoken of in the [prophetic] tradition, where it says: “That is the being I saw beneath the God of Israel on the River Chebar, and I knew that they were cherubs” [Ezek. 10:22].

The mission of each is in accord with its essence: the one sent on an errand of mercy is from water; the one who goes as an emissary of justice is derived from fire. Therefore no one angel is sent for both justice and mercy.<br>“God blessed them, saying: ‘Be fruitful and multiply, filling the land and the waters of the seas’” [Gen. 1:22].

The angels that were created on the fifth day are negated, just as the spark is reabsorbed into the coal, once they have sung their song. The reason [for their existence] is external to them and they are not sufficiently strong to stand before their Creator. They are incarnated a second time, sing their song, and then they disappear. Of this matter it has been said: “New each morning, great is Your faith!” [Lam. 3:23]. Here our Psalm continues: “All of them look to You to give them their food in its due time” [Ps. 104:27].

For the name was not complete until Adam was created in God’s image. Only then was the seal complete, about which the prophet said to the prince of Tyre: “you are the seal of the account” [Ezek. 28:12]. He meant to say that you are on the rung of Adam, who completed the ten <i>sefirot</i>. The word <i>tokhnit</i> here means “account,” as in “a full account of the bricks” [Exod. 5:18].

Here He concludes His words regarding the sixth day, sealing them with “it was good,” the name of God. Here the phrase is repeated a second time in the verse “God saw all that He had made, and behold it was very good” [Gen. 1:31]. The word “very” refers to attachment to the Nothing, which is [the primal] good, that which brings about the renewal of generations.

                    "Thus there are three allusions to the seventh millennium: the destruction of the world, the delight of souls, and the negation of the evil urge. Parallel to the world’s destruction, David says in our Psalm: “He looks to earth and it trembles; He touches the mountains and they smoke” [Ps. 104:32].

This joy is the added Holy Spirit, basking in the light of <i>shekhinah</i> as it cleaves to the soul. Of the negation of the evil urge and the passing away of the spirit of defilement, he says: “Sins will vanish from the earth” [Ps. 104:35].

The other verse stipulates: ‘they were standing up facing the House’ [II Chron. 3:13]. There is no contradiction here. Their countenances face each other when Israel are performing God’s will.

These underwent exile in three waves, as it is written: “for the first time brought abasement to the land of Naphtali and Zebulun while the later time was severe” [Isa. 8:23]. This is clarified in <i>Seder ‘Olam</i>, based on the verses. Judah and Benjamin also underwent exile in three waves, as it is written: “You walked in your sister’s path; therefore I will place her cup in your hands” [Ezek. 23:31]. And so it is clearly explicated in the verse.",
                    "Those who first went forth into exile will be the first to return. Some time later, the children of Judah will return. So Isaiah prophesied when he said: “In that day my Lord will apply His hand a second time to redeem the other part of His people from Assyria—as also from Egypt, Pathos, Nubia, Elam, Shinar, Hamath, and the coastlands” [Isa. 11:11]. The verse specifies “a second time,” for the redemption of the ten tribes will come first. And thus “the other part of His people” who will have remained in Assyria. In the following verse Isaiah lists the two exiles and makes mention of the two acts of redemption, referring to each and every one with its proper name. He says: “He will hold up a signal to the nations and assemble the banished of Israel; and gather the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth” [Isa. 11:12]. He refers to the ten tribes as the “banished of Israel” as they dwell together but are banished from their land. The exile of Judah is designated as a dispersion, “and he will gather the dispersed of Judah.” The house of Israel will anoint a Messiah called Messiah ben Joseph; he will conquer lands and kingdoms and go to Jerusalem and rebuild it, as it is written: “The Lord builds Jerusalem, He gathers in the dispersed of Israel” [Ps. 147:2]. But he will die in battle. Of him it states: “In that day, the wailing in Jerusalem shall be great” [Zach. 12:11] and “they shall lament to Me about those who are slain” [Zach. 12:10]. Afterwards, the dispersed and scattered among the nations shall come and appoint a single leader, the Messiah, son of David, who was with them in exile. They will come to the Land of Israel with the permission of the kings of the nations and with their assistance. As it is written: “And out of all of the nations, said the Lord, they shall bring all your brothers on horses, in chariots and drays, on mules and dromedaries to Jerusalem, My holy mountain, as an offering to the Lord” [Isa. 66:20]. This kingdom will continue and never end. This is the meaning of “Thus declares the Lord God, Who gathers the banished of Israel” [Isa. 56:8]: these are the ten tribes. “I will gather still more to those already gathered” [ibid.]: I add yet another gathering to the first, the dispersed of Judah. This is the meaning of “The Lord your God will restore your exile and have mercy upon you. He will return and gather you from among all the nations among whom He scattered you” [Deut. 30:3]. It is possible that there may be a substantial period of time between these two ingatherings. Afterwards they might yet have to be as herdsmen in the wilderness of the nations, in order to separate out and purify the wicked among Israel, and to smelt them just as silver is smelt in the refining furnace, as happened during the Exodus from Egypt….<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">208</sup><i class=\"footnote\">An eschatological discussion of Zech. 9:9 etc. has been ellipted.</i>"
