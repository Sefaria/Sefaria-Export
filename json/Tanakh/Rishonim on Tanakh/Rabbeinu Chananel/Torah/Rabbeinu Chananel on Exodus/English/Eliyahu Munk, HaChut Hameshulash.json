The pressure mentioned resulted from the fact that the family of Yaakov who numbered only seventy souls when they came to Egypt and were settled by Joseph in the region of Goshen, increased and multiplied so that this region became far too small to contain them and to offer them a livelihood. It was G’d’s blessing which led to this eventual problem as the Egyptians were not willing to cede additional parts of their land to the Israelites. This phenomenon of artificially forcing a large population into an inadequate amount of land is also described in Judges 1,34, where the Emorite is described as trying to compress the increasing numbers of the tribe of Dan into a mountainous region, not allowing them to take up residence in the plains below.

                "ושאלה אשה משכנתה, there can be no question that G’d would condone deceiving people into thinking that one borrows from them while not intending to return the “borrowed” objects. The meaning of the word ושאלה is not “she shall borrow,” but “she shall request as a gift.” We find the root שאל used in that sense in Judges 8,24 when Gideon asks the people who wanted to appoint him as king for something else instead. I quote: אשאלה מכם שאלה ותנו לי איש נזם שללו, “I request from you only one thing, that each one of you give me one nose-ring of the loot you captured, etc.” We also find the word שאל used as a request for a gift when Bat Shva relates this request to her son King Solomon in the name of Adoniah, Solomon’s half brother in Kings I 2,20-21. She said:שאלה אחת קטנה אנכי שואלת מאתך, יותן את אבישג השונמית וגו', “I have a small request from you; Avishag the Shunamite be given as a wife etc.” [clearly this woman was not going to be “on loan” to Adoniah. Ed.] The reason the Torah phrased it as ושאלה אשה משכנתה, when it could have written in general terms ושאל איש מאת מצרי, “let everyone request from an Egyptian, etc.,” was simply that if even the women would give gifts to the departing Israelites there was no need to mention that the men would do likewise. This sort of reasoning is found in Isaiah 33,23 where the lame are mentioned as helping themselves to loot. Need the prophet add that the healthy people did the same?"

                "בני בכורי ישראל. Moses is to tell Pharaoh in G’d’s name that if He had delivered the Israelites under his control in order to discipline them somewhat this was not because He, their G’d, had rejected them. We know this from Moses telling the people in Deuteronomy 8,8 that any discomfort they had ever been subjected to in their journey was due to the discipline administered by a loving father to miscreant children. The father does not enjoy punishing his children but it is necessary in order for them to learn that misconduct carries a price. Pharaoh had greatly exceeded the authority he had to be G’d’s agent in educating the Israelites. As a fitting retribution G’d would kill Pharaoh’s own firstborn during the last of the plagues. When G’d referred to the Israelites as בני בכורי ישראל , this was a complimentary description of them, as for instance the line בני א-ל חי, “Children of the living G’d” in Hoseah 2,1. Similarly, Mount Sinai, a sanctified mountain is also referred to as הר ה', “G’d’s mountain,” in Numbers 10,33. Similarly, the Holy Temple, the holiest of structures, is known as “the House of the Lord” in Isaiah 56,7 The precise wording there is “for My House is called a House of Prayer.” "

Immediately afterwards we are told that Moses himself returned to Egypt. If the Torah reports sequentially, Moses could not have been at the inn at the time Tzipporah had this encounter. ויבקש המיתו, the person under threat of death was the boy, seeing that the angel had assumed the form of a serpent about to swallow the little boy. This serpent then spit out the boy and began to devour him from the opposite end, swallowing up to the part where the circumcision was to be performed. At that point, ותקח צפורה צור, Tzipporah understood what the problem was, i.e. that they were being punished for being tardy in performing the boy’s circumcision so that she herself performed it with a sharp flint."

                "למה הרעותה לעם הזה?, this is not to be understood as a complaint or insolence, but simply as a question. Moses wanted to know the use of the attribute which decrees sometimes afflictions on the Just and all kinds of advantages for the wicked, while the Just are forced to watch this. Moses who had become exposed to these manifestations involving his own people even after G’d had told him that He had taken note of the injustice done to them, did not understand all this. Moses also did not understand which afflictions have what purpose, as sometimes they appear to strike people who clearly are guilty of certain sins, as per Isaiah 57,17 בעון בצעו קצפתי ואכהו הסתר ואקצוף, “For their sinful greed I was angry; I struck them and turned away in My wrath.” On the other hand, Moses also realised that there is an affliction known as יסורים של אהבה, afflictions resulting from G’d’s love, such as the manna being described as ויענך וירעיבך, “He afflicted you by letting you starve,” (Deuteronomy 8,16) where the very affliction was the forerunner of acts of love such as the heavenly bread G’d fed the Israelites for 40 years in the desert. Concerning such afflictions David has said in Psalms 94,12 אשרי הגבר אשר תיסרנו י-ה, “hail the man whom G‘d has seen fit to subject to such afflictions!” When Moses noticed that from the day he had begun his mission and had confronted Pharaoh the workload of his brethren had been increased instead of decreased, he asked G’d why He had permitted Pharaoh to get away with this when it was clearly within His power to save the Israelites altogether? Why had He not immediately saved the people seeing that it was His plan to do this, and he had appointed him to be His instrument in bringing this about? He could not understand that if even the midwives, who are only human beings, not possessing the power to give life or to kill, are being credited with “giving life to the babies whom they refused to murder” (Exodus 1,17) why G’d Who is surely able to grant such life, did not save the same Jews whom He credited the midwives with saving? We must surely understand the line ותחיינה את הילדים, as “they allowed the children to keep living,” not as “they granted life to the children!” Here too, the words למה הרעותה have to be understood as “why did You allow the Egyptians to continue to do evil to the this people instead of Your having saved them?” Moses‘ question expressed concern that Pharaoh would be allowed to continue in this vein and to make the lives of the Israelites still more miserable. Actually, Moses’ question here is echoed by the prophet Jeremiah 12,1 when the prophet asked:מדוע דרך רשעים צלחה שלו כל בוגדי בגד,”why does the way of the wicked prosper? Why are the workers of treachery at ease?” The prophet did not criticise G’d but wanted to know if the prosperity enjoyed by the wicked is in payment of the good deeds which most of them also have performed at one time or other and which G’d cannot repay them in the hereafter seeing they have already forfeited their afterlife so that they have to enjoy their reward while on this earth. Alternatively, did G’d grant these people an enjoyable life on earth in order to increase the punishment they would endure after their bodies had died? G’d answered Moses that the apparent success of Pharaoh was only in order to make him suffer so much more in the end. The matter is similar to that described by David in Psalms 69,28 where he asks G’d concerning the Gentile nations: תנה עון על עונם ואל יבואו בצדקתך, “add that to their guilt; let them have no share of Your beneficence.” In our verse G’d’s answer to Moses was given in Exodus 6,1 עתה תראה אשר אעשה לפרעה, “from now on you will see what I am going to do to Pharaoh.” G’d meant, that the afflictions which Israel had to suffer had as their purpose to double the reward they would reap. This is the meaning of: “now you will see.” You, Moses, will see and realise shortly that the relative peace which Pharaoh has enjoyed up until now was only meant to enable Me to increase the afflictions which I will subject him to. I had already made ready all these plagues. It was necessary for him to impose even harder working conditions on the Israelites in order to trigger carrying out My program, something which I had made ready on the day that I appointed you even though you did not realise this at the time. Not only is the result of My plan increased suffering for Pharaoh, but it is also increased reward for the Jewish people. The fact that they were able to endure it and did not collapse under this burden is proof that these afflictions  were motivated by My love for that people."

[That plague had been a natural disaster, had not been predicted by a prophet. Ed.] The expression describing the unique nature and quality of this phenomenon is similar to the Book of Kings II 18,5 describing the unparalleled faith in the Lord by the King Chiskiyah. The meaning there is that whereas Chizkiyah’s faith in the Lord was unparalleled, his fear of the Lord was matched by other people. Similarly, we are told in Joshua 10,14 that G’d’s responses to Joshua’s requests was unparalleled, so that even the sun was made to arrest its orbit as his request. However, G’d had done the same thing for the sake of Moses at his time, as well as for Nakdimon ben Gurion, the difference being that Moses did not even have to ask for it. (compare Taanit 20)"

[the “now” refers to the era of Rabbeinu Chananel. Ed.] It is common knowledge in my time that this is the correct interpretation, as in connection with the crocodiles (or frogs, depending on which interpretation we accept for the meaning of the word צפרדע), the Torah stated that these creatures remained only in the river Nile, not posing a threat to the urban areas, whereas here the Torah speaks of the total disappearance of all the locusts from the entire territory of Egypt.

G’d, i.e. Moses, commanded the people to ask for these trinkets, garments, etc., as outright gifts. G’d would see to it that the Israelites asking for this would be considered by the Egyptians as deserving of this so that they would gladly part with the items in question. This did not involve any misrepresentation on the part of G’d, the Egyptians being perfectly aware that nothing they would give their Israelite neighbours could even remotely compensate them for the wages these people had never received during all these years. In that connection, consider that a Jewish servant (for whose services his master paid six years’ wages in advance to the servant’s creditor) at the end of his 6 years of service must be given an ex gratia payment by his master so that he can establish himself economically. (Deuteronomy 15,13-14). How much more so would the Israelites be entitled at this time to a small installment of all the money owed them for 210  (or 86) years of slave labour!"

                "החודש הזה לכם ראש חדשים, the determination of the calendar, i.e. months of the year, is made only on the basis of astronomical calculations and is not based on visual observation. The proof that this is so is the fact that during the forty years the Israelites were wandering in the desert the heavenly cloud which enclosed them by day, shielding them from heat and from the eyes of curious outsiders, as well as the pillar of fire by night, made visual observation an impossibility. This is the meaning of the verse in Nechemyah 9,19 ואתה ברחמיך הרבים לא עזבתם במדבר את עמוד הענן לא סר מעליהם ביומם להנחותם בהדרך ואת העמוד האש בלילה להאיר להם ואת הדרך אשר ילכו בה. “You, in Your abundant compassion, did not abandon them in the wilderness. The pillar of cloud did not depart from them to lead them the way by day, nor the pillar of fire by night to give them light in the way they were to go.” How then were they possibly able to determine the times of the new moon and all the important elements of the calendar depending on this by visual observation? There is no question that the central commandment meant by our verse is to calculate the times of the new moon by astronomical means.",
                "We have an ancient tradition that of the 12 months of the year 5 have 30 days each, whereas another five have 29 days each. The remaining two months sometimes have 29 days and other times 30 days. Sometimes, one of the two months in question has 30 days, whereas the other one has 29 days. The two months referred to are always Marcheshvan and Kislev. We also have an ancient tradition that the first day of the month of Tishrey is at the same time the first day of the New year. Every single month, according to tradition handed down since the time of Moses, consists (astronomically speaking) of 29 days 12 hours and 793 parts of the 1080 parts into which I hour (60 minutes) is divided in Jewish law. ",
                "This tradition is spelled out in Chronicles I 12,32: ומבני יששכר יודעי בינה לעתים לדעת מה יעשה ישראל ראשיהם מאתים וכל אחיהם על פיהם,”and from the tribe of Issachar, men who knew how to interpret the signs of the times to determine how they should act, their chiefs were 200, and all their kinsmen followed them.” There is no discipline that requires greater wisdom than the calculation of the mysteries connected to when the lunar cycle renews itself.",
                " Once one has already seen the new moon, it is a well known fact that such a day is observed officially as the new moon and our festivals are calculated on that basis, for instances Passover on the 15th of the month of Nissan, etc. The calculation upon which the real renewal of the lunar cycle is based, known as מולד in our halachic literature, is something which is calculated not visually but astronomically by our sages, something which required special ordination for the people entrusted with that task [before the introduction of a permanent calendar. Ed.]<small>  The people would be informed by the result of the sages’ calculations when this still was required. They would accept this ruling without fail. This is the meaning of the words in Chronicles we have quoted: “and all their kinsmen followed them.”</small>",
                " You will find another reference to this subject in Samuel I 20,5 where David and Yonathan discussed the imminent celebration of the new moon, (2 days on that occasion). If the determination of the date of the new moon had depended on visual observation, how could David have known beforehand that the new moon would be observed both on the 30th of the month and the day following on that occasion, seeing the moon had not yet been sighted as yet? Clearly, the determination was made on the basis of astronomical data, and David was aware that in view of the previous month having been a month of 29 days that according to the astronomical data the new moon following would have to be observed on two days. The text there (verse 24-26) reads as follows: ויסתר דוד בשדה בשדה ויהי החודש וישב המלך על הלחם לאכול.. ולא דבר שאול מאומה ביום ההוא כי אמר מקרה הוא, בלתי טהור הוא....ויהי ממחרת החודש השני ויפקד מקום דוד. “David hid in the field. On the new moon the king sat down to eat and he did not say a word (about David’s absence) saying it is the result of seminal ejaculation, presumably he is ritually impure <small>[and had no chance to immerse himself in a ritual bath. Ed.]</small> so that he could not attend. It came to pass on the second new moon, etc.”<small>  [There follows the famous altercation between Yonathan and his father, etc, which I do not bother to repeat here as it is not really necessary for the author’s point to be made. Ed.]</small> From the context of the story, it is quite impossible to understand the last words as applying to the celebration of the new moon on the following month. ",
                "It is clear therefore that even in the days of King Sha-ul arrangements had been made beforehand to observe 2 days of Rosh Chodesh. Such arrangements beforehand were based on the calculations of the Sanhedrin, Supreme Court. What was the custom in the days of King Shaul continued for a period of about 1100 years from the time of Moses until the days of Antignos the head of the Supreme Court during the early days of the Second Temple. When two of the students of this sage by the name of Tzadok and Beyssus heard their mentor say “do not be like the servants who serve their master because of the reward they expect to receive as compensation, but serve the master for altruistic considerations,” they began to question the entire foundations of Judaism, the concept of reward and punishment. They concluded that based on their mentor’s words there was no such concept in Judaism, and they began to live in a style which reflected their new found philosophical freedom. Once they had crossed this threshold they began to question the tradition of calculating the new moon astronomically rather than by visual observation, challenging the established authorities whose ruling was based on the oral Torah rather than on the written text as per our verse above i.e. the word זה, “this,” which implies visual observation. This was the beginning of the schism in Judaism, the heretics being known as צדוקים, based on the name of the originator Tzadok. Their basic argument was to challenge the tradition which did not clearly base itself on the written text of the Torah.<br> The Torah sages during that period saw themselves forced to counter the arguments of these people by proving that what they did based on tradition did not contravene the text of the written Torah, but that what had been the accepted manner in which the sages determined these dates was not only accurate but was always in harmony with the Torah.<br> Rabban Gamliel in Rosh Hashanah 25 already told his audience not to put too much stock into the need to actually see the new moon before the festival of the new moon could be observed, seeing that the astronomical data outweigh the importance of visual confirmation. He quoted a long family tradition to support his view. The calculation he referred to stated that the length of a lunar month is never shorter than 29 and a half days and 793 portions of the 1080 divisions into which the 13th hour is divided.<br> These words of Rabban Gamliel prove that he, who more than anyone else provided elaborate safeguards to prove if witnesses claiming to have sighted the new moon had spoken the truth, did not in fact base his decisions on the testimony of these eye-witnesses at all.",
                " There is also an entire Mishnah on the same folio in the Talmud which reads: “if the entire supreme Court as well as the people generally had come to testify to the sighting of the new moon, and the examination of the testimony had taken so much time that at the end it was already too late to declare that day as “new moon,” the following day would be declared as new moon. This Mishnah is clear proof that the Court did not have a tradition according to which the actual sighting of the new moon was the decisive factor in determining the calendar. If they did have a tradition that the sighting determines the dates, how could they have bothered to examine more than the necessary number of two witnesses and allow the opportunity to declare that date as new moon to go by without sanctifying it?.",
                " An even more convincing proof is the following: The Talmud states there that if two witnesses arrived at the court and they testified: “we saw the new moon on the evening of what would have been the 30th of the month, and on the following evening we did not see it again,” Rabban Gamliel accepted this testimony as believable. If the court had based their determination on the sighting of the moon rather than on the astronomical calculations, surely the fact that the moon, according to their testimony, had not been visible on the following night must have proved that the witnesses had been lying! Rabban Gamliel’s acceptance then meant that he had calculated that the correct date was the date of the first sighting reported by the witnesses. Seeing that there was then a new month and the court had sanctified it this was the end of the matter. <small>[the balance of their testimony was quite irrelevant. There are numerous other interpretations as to why Rabban Gamliel accepted these witnesses. All agree that Rabban Gamliel was not really interested in sightings when the sightings conflicted with his astronomical data. Ed.]</small> ",
                "The Talmud reports that in Rabban Gamliel’s study there were maps of the sky depicting different possible or impossible positions of the moon at the time of the new moon, which the Rabbi used to determine if the testimony of the witnesses could be relied on from an astronomical point of view. A major reason why Rabban Gamliel had these maps made was to prove to the followers of Tzadok and Beyssus that he was an expert of the orbit described by the moon at any time during the month. He would predict accordingly when the end of the cycle would occur after 29 days and when it would occur after 30 days. He taught his own students how to become thoroughly familiar with the position of the moon in the sky at any time of the month, allowing also for the variations of the moon’s position in the sky due to the season of the year. When he proved himself invariably correct month after month, year after year, the arguments of the opponents gradually were silenced. He still kept up the regular examinations of witnesses and they were encouraged to come forward as a reminder of the period when the matter had been a clouded issue.",
                " All our sages agree that the source of investing the Sanhedrin with the authority of determining changes in the calendar goes back to Moses at Sinai, and that this authority has been used by the Sanhedrin. Any changes in rulings made in the past would have to have been authorized by another larger court superior to the original one in numbers and wisdom. The beginning of our chapter is the authority granted to Moses to determine our calendar. "

                "ומושב בני ישראל אשר ישבו במצרים, we find in connection with the redemption from Egypt 3 different dates of termination all of which relate or appear to relate to the same event. The numbers are: “400 years,” i.e. the prediction in Genesis chapter 15 to Avraham; we find the number 430 years in our verse here. Finally, we have the number 210 years. In order to reconcile these numbers we must remember that the number 400 refers to the time from the birth of Yitzchok. Seeing G’d’s promise to Avraham concerned “his descendants,” any count could not begin until Avraham had such descendants, i.e. Yitzchok. G’d had told him that his descendants would be known through Yitzchok, (not through Ishmael or the sons of Keturah) The number 430 begins with the date when Avraham had been told about his future by G’d at the covenant between the pieces in chapter 15 in Genesis. The number 210 were the years during which Avraham’s descendants were not free men living in what would become their own country in the future. During the latter 86 years of these 210 years they were cruelly enslaved and abused. During the first 124 years of their stay in Egypt, until the death of the last surviving brother of Joseph they enjoyed freedom in Egypt.<br> It is interesting that we find three dates about the redemption in the future mentioned also in the Book of Daniel. There we are told about 1) 1150 years; 2) 1290 years; 3) 1335 years. I am quoting from the first mention of redemption in Daniel 8,13-14: “Then I heard a holy being speaking, and another holy being said to whomever it was he was speaking to: ‘how long will what was seen in the vision last- the regular offering be forsaken because of transgression, the sanctuary be surrendered and the heavenly host be trampled?’ He answered me: “for twenty thee hundred evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary will be cleansed.” Seeing that mornings and evenings were counted as separate, what are meant are half this number i.e.1150 years.<br> It is further recorded there in chapter 12,11 that from the time the regular offering had been abolished and an appalling abomination had been set up in its place it will be one thousand two hundred and ninety days. Immediately after this, in verse 12 we read: “happy the one who waits and reaches one thousand three hundred and thirty five days.”<br> It had been G’d’s plan that the Exodus from Egypt would be described in terms of 3 separate conclusions, extremities. The reason was that G’d wanted to offer us who are awaiting the final redemption increased hope that it will eventually materialize. Having known that all three dates (prophecies) concerning the date of the redemption had come true, we would be encouraged in our faith that the promise held out in the Book of Daniel will also come true even if we appear to be at a loss to understand these numbers in advance of their becoming history. <br> One thing we can be pretty sure about: G’d allowed Himself fall back positions, as He has always done since the time He created man on earth, so that if we deserve to be redeemed earlier than G’d’s timetable foresaw He would be able to take advantage of that number. In the Torah too, G’d had not irrevocably decided beforehand that the redemption could not occur until the date it did occur, or even earlier. "

However, this verse is only meant to inform us that from this year onward they would know that the date of observing the Passover will always occur on the anniversary of the Exodus. This also again proves that the calculation of the new moon does not rely on actual sightings."

                "ולא נחם אלוקים דרך ארץ פלשתים, He led them through the desert for a different reason, apart from the fact that the route through the land of the Philistines was the most convenient one. Had He led them in that direction, and He would have convinced the Philistines to allow the Israelites free passage, based on the longstanding treaty between Yitzchak and Avimelech, G’d could not have performed even a fraction of the miracles He had in mind to perform in order to strengthen the people’s confidence in Him.<br> Therefore, by making the Israelites take a circuitous route, G’d would be able not only to provide the people with manna, meat in the form of the quail, water produced by striking a rock, etc., etc., but the further away the Israelites would be from inhabited areas the greater would be the miracle that G’d could provide for several million people all of their needs. The lesson would also be taught that even in such inhospitable regions of the earth, the human species could survive if G’d wanted it so.<br> When G’d saved Chanayah, Mishael, and Azaryah from the fiery furnace, G’d could have saved these people by performing a far lesser miracle. However, He wanted to demonstrate His power at that time. (compare Daniel 3,27) G’d did not simply extinguish the flames in the furnace, for instance, but let it roar at its fiercest in order to show that if He wanted man to survive unharmed inside such a furnace it could be done, if only G’d wanted it. Or, to take the example of Daniel in the lions’ den. All G’d had to do was to kill the lions and Daniel would have been saved. The reason why G’d went to the trouble of preventing these starved lions from making a meal out of Daniel was to demonstrate to the onlookers the extent of His control over nature. (compare Daniel 6,23).<br> Another example of the same kind is found in Judges 7,2. If G’d would have allowed Gideon with 10,000 men to defeat the many times larger army of the Midianites, this would have been miracle enough. Why did G’d shrink the number of soldiers at Gideon’s disposal to 300? For no other reason than to make the miracle so much greater.<br> G’d wanted to teach the lesson that numbers did not matter at all; what counted was that the soldiers be G’d fearing men who had never bowed their knee to an alien deity. Prowess with a sword was not what was required, but lapping up water by hand and bringing it to one’s mouth is what distinguishes man from the beasts who lower themselves to the water."

                "ויאמינו בה' ובמשה עבדו. Belief consists of 4 different parts. <br>There is belief in the Lord, as we know from Chronicles II 20,20 האמינו בה' אלוקיכם ותאמנו, “believe absolutely in the Lord your G’d and you will be able to stand firm!”  This is the kind of belief that our verse speaks of when it reports the Israelites as ויאמינו בה' ובמשה עבדו, they believed in the Lord and in Moses His servant.” <br>The second type of belief is the belief in the authenticity of His prophets which implies the duty to accept the prophet’s instructions. We find a direct reference to this in Isaiah 53,1 מי האמין לשמועתנו? “Who does believe in our assurances?” <br>The prophet speaks about the promise of there being an hereafter, demanding that we must believe in this as well as the fact that the reward for performing good deeds in this life will be forthcoming in this afterlife. This is also what David spoke of when he said in Psalms 27,13: לולא האמנתי לראות בטוב ה' בארץ חיים, “Had I not the assurance that I would enjoy the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living, etc.” <br> There is the obligation to believe in the eventual arrival of a redeemer. This is a cornerstone of Judaism. This is also what is meant by Isaiah 28,16 הנני יסד בציון אבן, אבן בוחן פנת יקרת מוסד מוסד המאמין לא יחיש, “Behold I will found in Zion, stone by stone, a tower of precious cornerstones, exceedingly firm; he who believes need not fear.” All those who believe in this assurance will acquire numerous merits.<br> We know that G’d Himself cited Avraham’s belief in the promises He made to him for the far distant future as an act of righteousness as documented in Genesis 15,6והאמין בה' ויחשביה לו צדקה, “He believed G’d’s promise, and He accounted it for him as an act of righteousness.”<br> People believing in this promise of a rosy future will also wind up in Gan Eden as we know from Isaiah 26,2 פתחו שערים ויבא גוי צדיק שומר אמונים. “Open the gates, and let a righteous nation enter, a nation that keeps faith.” Such a person will experience the life in the world to come as we know from Chabakuk 2,4 וצדיק באמונתו יחיה, “and the Just will live (eternally) due to his faith.”<br> Anyone who does not believe in these precepts of Judaism falls into the category of people of whom we read in Job 15,22: לא יאמין שוב מני חושך וצפוי הוא אלי חרב, “he is never sure he will come back from the dark; a sword stares him in the face.” He will not participate in the redemption when it comes. We know this from the prophet Ezekiel 20,38אברותי מכם המורדים והפושעים בי, “I will remove from you those who rebel and transgress against Me.“ It is also written in Psalms 31,24: אמונים נוצר ה' ומשלם על יתר עושה גאוה, “the Lord guards and requites the loyal, and more than requites him who acts arrogantly.” The meaning of the verse is clear: G’d rewards the ones who have displayed faith in Him, whereas the ones who have failed to believe in Him He will punish for having acted so arrogantly. They will not be granted life in the future. This is implied by the first part of the verse from Chabakuk 2,4 we quoted already in which the prophet states הנה עופלה לא ישרה נפשו בו,; “Lo his spirit is puffed up within him not upright; but the righteous man is rewarded with life for his fidelity.”"

Our verse also teaches as a corollary that the father is obliged to look after the needs of his wife and children. The Torah phrases this as מספר נפשותיכם, “the number of persons belonging to you.”"

                "נקם ינקם, the reason the Torah employed the term “revenge” in this context [instead of speaking of judicial execution, Ed.] is that it is clear that the master had intended to kill the slave when hitting him. He had arranged to do it in such a sly way that it would be considered as a blow out of a feeling of revenge but not one intended to be lethal. The Torah characterises the master’s execution as an act of “avenging the servant” so that everyone will be aware that he had intended to kill deliberately and the execution is the avenging of an uncalled for murder. If the killing of the master was not judicial execution, he himself will also be avenged."

                "עין תחת עין, there is a tradition by our sages (Baba Kamma 84) concerning this that the meaning is: “the value of an eye for the value of an eye.” The Torah does not speak of the person inflicting the loss of someone’s eye paying with his losing an eye of his own. The proof that this could not have been what the Torah meant is verse 19 in our chapter רק שבתו יתן ורפא ירפא, “he must only pay for his loss of income and his medical expenses.”<br> If we were to do to a person who has caused the loss of another’s limb exactly as he had done, why would he have to pay something in addition to that? After all, he himself loses pay due to absence from work and he also incurs medical expenses for treatment of his severed limb!?<br> Furthermore, even assuming that the Torah’s words here were to be interpreted literally, not all situations are alike so that the literal application would resemble any kind of “tit for tat.” If the eye which a healthy person gouged out belonged to a person who had only one good eye, how would the loss of one of two good eyes by the person who caused the injury even come close to “fair retribution?” Not only that. Some people’s constitution would not be able to survive the loss of an organ whereas others would. If a person had had a kidney ruined beyond repair by someone who only had a single kidney left, taking that person’s kidney would be equivalent to a death sentence!<br> Furthermore, in Leviticus 24,19-20 we read כאשר עשה כן יעשה בו, “just as he has done (to another), so shall be done to him.” This verse cannot be applied in any other way than the way our sages have seen fit to understand it. The thrust of the verses is to indemnify the injured party in a manner commensurate to the injury he has sustained, not by depriving him of a limb of his own. It would be physically impossible to cause a person an exact duplicate of the injury he himself has suffered. If he were to cause either a lesser or a greater injury than the one he had sustained, he would be in violation of what the Torah wrote as he would not have complied with the Torah’s demand “as he had done so should be done to him.” In the case of monetary compensation, experts can evaluate the precise amount of the value of the loss sustained. <br> It is possible to understand the line כאשר עשה כן יעשה לו, as meaning: “just as he has caused harm, harm shall be caused to him.” Proof of this being the meaning of the words can be found in Judges 15,11 where Shimshon said: “as they have done to me so I have done to them.” The dispute had begun when the Philistines had taken Shimshon’s wife and in retaliation he burned their crops. Seeing that the retaliation by Shimshon did not match the harm done to him by the Philistines, it is clear that the meaning of the line is merely that harm done will be requited. Any retaliation therefore would be considered as “as he has done so shall be done to him.”<br> We also find that the prophet Ovadiah 15-16 prophesies concerning the future of Esau “as you did so shall be done to you. Your conduct shall be requited.” He goes on to spell out what precisely this involves: “the same cup that you drank from on My Holy Mount shall all nations drink evermore; drink till their speech grows thick and they become as though they had never been.” I have provided you with proof based both on logic and on verses from Scripture that it is impossible to translate the line עין תחת עין, as meaning “an eye for an eye.”"

                "הנה אנכי שולח מלאך לפניך, the angel of which the Torah speaks here is Michael, the great prince, the one of whom Gavriel said to Daniel: “at that time Michael the great prince who stands beside the sons of your people will appear.” (Daniel 12,1). It is also written in Daniel 10,21 ואין אחד מתחזק עמי על אלה כי אם מיכאל שרכם, ”No one is helping me against them except your prince Michael.” This is also the angel who said to Joshua “I am the prince of the hosts of the Lord, now I have come.” (Joshua 5,14) <br>Our sages explained in connection with this verse that the words כי שמי בקרבו, are equivalent to G’d saying that the name of the angel mentioned in our verse is “the prince (commander in Chief) of the Lord’s hosts.” We find another reference (oblique) to this when Solomon during his inaugural prayer of the Temple he had just completed, (Kings I 8,43) said: כי שמך נקרא על הבית הזה, “for Your name is attached to this house.”",
                " כי לא ישא לפשעכם, this is a warning by G’d for the people to be especially careful not to commit any act which is offensive to G’d, as although G’d does send this angel ahead of the people, his task is not to forgive any trespasses, something reserved for G’d personally, exclusively. The prophet Isaiah 43,25 underlines this point when he quotes G’d as saying: אנכי, אנכי, הוא מוחה פשעיך, “It is I, only I, Who wipes out your transgressions.”"

                "כל הדברים אשר דבר ה' נעשה. The word נעשה, “we will do,” here includes all the commandments of the Lord, negative commandments as well as positive ones, the ones requiring an exertion, an activity. The reason why this is not a misnomer is that if someone refrains from violating a negative commandment he is considered as having “performed” a commandment, i.e the commandment not to violate G’d’s legislation in that matter. We have a complete verse confirming this in Psalms 119,3 אף לא פעלו עולה, בדרכיו הלכו, “they have done no wrong, but have followed His ways.” In other words, not doing evil is considered equivalent to doing good."

                "ויקח משה את הדם ויזרוק על העם, he sprinkled the blood on them as a symbolic act signifying their entering the covenant with G’d, a covenant that requires blood to seal it. In fact, the blood stain on the garments of the Israelites as a result of this sprinkling was afterwards called עדי [from עד “witness.” Ed.] as it was testimony to the fact that the wearer had become a member of this covenant. This is why after the people had sinned with the golden calf the Torah demands that they remove this sign of such a covenant seeing that they had breached the covenant (Exodus 33,5). The Israelites are also reported to have divested themselves of these blood-stained garments in Exodus 33,6. The reason why G’d had chosen blood to be the symbol of this covenant was to warn the people that if they would prove loyal to the covenant everything would be fine, whereas if they would violate it, G’d on His part would also make the Israelites’ blood something anyone could spill without fear of Divine reprisal."

                "ועשו ארון, the ark is a symbol of the righteous and intelligent man who is described as such only if his character qualities reflect the external image he portrays, projects. This is the reason why the ark was encased in gold both from the inside and the outside. <br> Just as the dimensions of the floor of the ark were two and a half cubits in length and one and a half cubits in width, resulting in a square area of four cubits minus one quarter cubit square, so the righteous person should remain constantly aware that the four elements which make up his physicality should not become the sum total of his existence, but should be augmented liberally by the physical performance of good deeds such as caring for others. <br> Just as the walls of the ark, when combined, total 12 cubits (when measuring the combined total of the exterior dimensions, 1,5+2,5;+1,5+2,5;+1,5+2,5). [the lid is not part of the measurements. Ed.] The combined lengths of the walls totaled 7.5 cubits, whereas the combined length of the short walls totaled 4.5 cubits. The righteous person is expected to fulfill all the 12 conditions set out in Psalm 15,1 as the necessary qualifications before one is deserving to sojourn in G’d’s holy tent, or on G’d’s holy mountain. <br> If one wishes to attain a loftier level of relative perfection than that of a “mere” righteous individual, the next step up is becoming a נביא, prophet, or at least acquiring the spiritual level expected of a prophet. This is symbolised by the kapporet above the Ark.<br>  The fact that the entire kapporet was made of pure gold. that it was not merely overlaid with gold, indicates that it symbolised something even purer than the Ark itself. We know that a prophet is considered as כלו צדק, “totally righteous,” from Proverbs 8,8 “all the words of my mouth are with righteousness.” The cherubs above the kapporet are an allusion to the angels, beings on an even higher spiritual level than the prophets. They were spreading their wings heavenward as an allusion of their striving to be near the Shechinah, which is on a higher level spiritually than the angels, seeing that the angels are the throne, (foundation of) ever ready to welcome the attribute כבוד, i.e. the attribute which occupies the throne. This is the meaning of the words in verse 20: אל הכפורת יהיו הכרובים, “the faces of the cherubs will be turned toward the kapporet.” They had to look downwards, towards the lid and were forbidden to gaze at the Shechinah. Above everything is G’d Himself as is written in Samuel II 6,2 אשר נקרא שם שם ה' צב-אות יושב הכרובים עליו, “to which the Name was attached, the name of the Lord of Hosts Enthroned on the cherubs.” Solomon also constructed the cherubs in the Temple out of wood, as is written (Kings I 6,23) “he made in the sanctuary two cherubs out of olive wood.” [these wooden cherubs, ten cubits high, are not to be confused with the cherubs which are an integral part of the lid of the Holy Ark, made of solid gold, and which were in the Holy of Holies. Ed.]"

                "ועשית שלחן, the table represented the kings of Israel who entertain the Torah scholars at their table This is what David told his son Solomon on his death-bed: “Barzilai’s sons shall be among the people who are regular guests at your table. (Kings I 2,7) We also have a verse in Kings I 5,2 describing the lavishness of King Solomon’s table and the quantities of food consumed on a daily basis.<br> The Torah, in describing the table in the Tabernacle as overlaid with gold, illustrates that the function of Royalty was primarily to make a great impression on the outside world. After Samuel had told Saul that he would be replaced as king by someone more worthy, Saul still begged the prophet to honour him at least in public as he wanted to maintain the appearance although he realised that this was no longer his position. (compare Samuel I 15,30).<br> The reason that the length of the table was 21/2 cubits was in order to symbolize two requirements which every king has to meet. 1) He must be competent in meting out justice; 2) he must be competent in waging war.  This is what the people had told Samuel when they asked him to appoint a king for them (Samuel I 8,20).<br> The size and height of the walls [the table did not have legs like our tables, Ed.] which amount to nine cubits cumulatively, symbolise the 9 commandments in the Torah specifically addressed to a Jewish King. 1) “he shall not keep many horses;” 2) “he shall not send the people back to Egypt in order to add to his supply of horses;” 3) “he shall not have too many wives.” 4) “he shall not become haughty;” 5) “he must not turn away from G’d’s commandments either to the left or to the right.” 6) “he shall write for himself two copies of the Torah;” 7) he shall read from the Torah every day of his life;” 8) he shall not amass too much silver and gold;“ 9) he shall not turn away from the commandments.” (Deuteronomy 17,8-20).<br> The function of the border around the surface of the table was to prevent any of the show-breads from falling off the table for whatever reason. It was intended to protect the show-breads, just as the Levites and the priests are supposed to be on guard against the king deviating from the path of the Torah. We have an example of this in Chronicles II 24,2: “Yoash, the king, did what was right in the eyes of the Lord as long as Yehoyadah the High Priest was alive.” In connection with King Uzziah we read in Chronicles II 26,5: “he applied himself to the worship of G’d during the time of Zecharyah, instructor of the visions of G’d.”<br> All the details that the Torah writes about in connection with all the vessels of the Tabernacle contain similar allusions of a moral-ethical nature. The Ark represents the righteous people. The table corresponds to the kings of Israel. The Menorah corresponds to the scholars of Israel. The golden altar corresponds to the priests, whereas the copper altar corresponds to the people at large. "

                "נסך רביעית ההין יין לכבש האחד. As soon as the priest had bowed down in order to offer the libation, the deputy High Priest would wave the flag cloth to signal to the Levites to begin to chant their hymns. At the time of the Mishnah, a certain ben Arza would then strike the cymbal as a further signal and the Levites would commence reciting their hymns. All the people assembled would bow down, and after each section the tekiah blast of the shofar would be blown and the trumpets would be blown until the end of the offering of the olah, the burnt offering.<br> At the end of that procedure the King and all those present with him would prostrate themselves (Chronicles II 29,28-40; compare also Tamid, 7,3.) The Levites would follow this procedure every day, varying the hymn they would sing.<br> On Sundays they would recite Psalm 24,1, seeing that this psalm deals with aspects of the creation of the universe. It recalls that everything had been void and empty before that “day.” The psalm concludes with the words ויבא מלך הכבוד, to commemorate the directive: “let there be light.” The attribute כבוד also known as Shechinah, is a great light.<br> On Mondays the Levites chanted psalm 48. In verse four of that psalm the separation between different levels of sanctity is alluded to. In the Holy Temple there were different levels of sanctity such as the עזרה, vestibule, the Sanctuary, and the Holy of Holies. On the second day of creation the Torah describes the separation between the “upper” and “lower” waters. (Genesis 1,6). These various levels of sanctity are referred to in verse four of our psalm by the word ארמנותיה, “its various citadels, palaces.”<br> On Tuesdays the Levites would chant psalm 82 which features a verse (3) speaking about judging the poor, etc. This corresponds to the directive that all the waters in the terrestrial world were to concentrate in one area so that the dry land could become visible. (Genesis 1,9) This was an allusion for the judges to congregate when they would sit in judgment and to pronounce judgment for each individual supplicant. On that day the Torah also directed that the earth should produce trees, etc., each according to its own kind (Genesis 1,12), an allusion to the individuality, which is to be preserved on earth. When we read in that psalm that alas, man had to die, unlike the angels, the reference is to the sin committed in that garden in which all these beautiful trees had grown. This is why the psalm recited by the Levites on the fourth day, i.e. psalm 94 which commences with the reminder that G’d does take revenge on those who hate Him, is appropriate for Wednesday, the day the sun and the moon were placed in orbit. The psalmist refers to people worshipping sun and moon.<br> On Thursdays the Levites used to chant psalm 81, which, amongst other matters, deals with the Exodus from Egypt. Pharaoh was compared to a sea monster, תנין, and on that day the great sea-monsters had been created (Genesis 1,21) <br>; On Fridays the Levites chanted psalm 93 describing how even G’d robed Himself in splendour. It was the day that man, the most accomplished of all the creatures was created, a creature combining within himself some divine attributes (created in the image of G’d). He had been assigned dominion over the animals and even over nature, i.e. he was liable to similarly regard himself as sovereign in his domain on earth. Chanting that psalm then was in keeping with the significance of the day. <br> On the Sabbath the Levites chanted psalm 92, a hymn in which the righteous are described as firmly planted in the House of the Lord, a reference to the Holy Temple. It is entirely possible that there are still more allusions in these various psalms chanted by the Levites on different days of the week."

                "ויפן וירד משה מן ההר. We learn from this word ויפן, he turned around, that Moses descended while facing the cloud just as he had done when ascending the mountain. In other words, just as he had ascended facing the cloud, he now descended keeping his face toward the cloud, walking backwards. The High Priest, on the Day of Atonement, emulated this when withdrawing from the Holy of Holies by walking backwards after having offered the incense before the lid of the Holy Ark, the kapporet, as well as some of the blood of the two offerings on behalf of the people as well as sprinkling some on the dividing curtain. We have a similar verse in Chronicles II 1,13 describing Solomon’s approach to the altar that was standing in Givon at that time. Even though one could say that the words ויבא שלמה לבמה אשר בגבעון ירושליםmean: “Solomon returned from the altar in Givon to Jerusalem,” [seeing Givon at that time was certainly not part of Jerusalem Ed.] the correct interpretation is that he withdrew in the same way as he had approached. The point of all this was to conform to the principle of שויתי ה' לנגדי תמיד, “I am keeping Hashem in front of Me at all times.” (Psalms 16,8) One does not turn one’s back on G’d. The Mishnah, Yuma 52 states: “in the manner he had entered he also exited.” This is also the way Leviticus 16,24 describes this, writing: “he exited and completed the ritual of his own burnt offering as well as that of the people.” These words have been interpreted by our sages to mean that the word לבמה “to the altar,” must also be read as מבמה.”from the altar,” when he was headed back to Jerusalem (Yuma 53). There is a precedent for this in Numbers 31,21, where the words הבאים למלחמה, must also mean הבאים מן המלחמה, “the ones who were returning from the war.” How do we know that indeed the Shechinah was on the mountain at the time Moses descended? In Deuteronomy 9,15 where Moses refers to his descent from the mountain, he adds the words: “and the mountain was burning in fire while the two tablets of the covenant were on my hands.” We learn from all of this that the student, when taking leave of his teacher, walks backwards until the face of his teacher is no longer directly visible to him. (Yuma 53)  This is also the reason why, at the end of the principal prayer the amidah, we step three steps backwards, as if to take leave of the G’d Whom we had faced and addressed before. (Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim section 123)."

                "על אשר עשו את העגל, there are many different forms of idolatrous cults. Some consist of the idol having the likeness of a human being, or at least the face of a human being. Other cults worship a symbol representing the appearance of a cherub, angel-like figure. Still others worship a force symbolised by the image of certain domestic beasts, free-roaming animals, or birds. This is what we read in Kings II 17,30-31. “The Babylonians made Sukoth-benoth, the men of Cuth made Nirgal, and the men of Chamass made Ashima, and the Avvites made Nivchaz and Tartak. The Sepharvides burned their children to Adramelech and Anamelech, the gods of the Sepharvaim.” All of these names are names of different deities. The expression Sukoth-benoth refers to a hen and her chicks; the name Nirgal refers to the rooster. The name Ashima describes a cat, whereas the name Nivchaz describes a dog. The name Tartak refers to a donkey, whereas Adramelech refers to an ape, and Adamelech refers to a peacock. I am pretty certain that the many cast idols represent stars or groups of stars in the celestial regions. This would correspond to Amos 5,26 “Sikkuth and Kiyun your astral deity, the images you have made for yourselves.” The words Sikkuth and Kiyyun are both names of stars and are what Jeremiah 44,19 refers to when he said: “and when we make offerings to the queen of Heaven and pour libations for her.” The people mentioned here referred to the stars as the “queen of Heaven.” The expression “kiyvun tzalmeychem´ in Amos 5,26 refers to Zachal, otherwise know as Shabtai, Saturn. The word kochav eloheychem in the same verse refers to one of the seven fixed stars (planets), i.e. the sun."

It was the blood of the sacrifices offered by the firstborn at Mount Sinai. It was known as עדי ישראל, “the jewelry of Israel.” They were called thus as they symbolised glory and great honour, seeing that this blood was the visible sign of the covenant concluded between G’d and the people of Israel. I have already drawn attention to this in my commentary on Exodus 24,8."
