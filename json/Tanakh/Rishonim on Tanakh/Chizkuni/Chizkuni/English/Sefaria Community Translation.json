                    "In the commandment to dwell in huts (sukkot) for seven days, it is not explicitly mentioned whether this includes both days and nights. How, then, do we know that the obligation encompasses both daytime and nighttime dwelling? We can draw an analogy from the usage of the word \"tishvu\" (you shall dwell) which appears both here and in a separate context, referring to dwelling in the Tent of Meeting. Just as in the case of the Tent of Meeting, the requirement to dwell therein includes both days and nights, so too, with the commandment to dwell in sukkot, the obligation extends to day and night. However, the Sages offer another explanation, comparing the 15th day mentioned in relation to the Festival of Matzot (Unleavened Bread) and the same date mentioned about the Festival of Sukkot. They infer that just as in the Festival of Matzot, the first night has a mandatory obligation and the following nights are optional, similarly, during the Festival of Sukkot, the first night is compulsory while the subsequent nights are optional. This brings clarity to the obligation of dwelling in sukkot during the seven days, incorporating both daytime and nighttime aspects, with the first night being a strict requirement and following nights being more lenient concerning the need to stay in the sukkah. בסוכות תשבו שבעות ימים, “you are to dwell in huts for seven days.” This is to remind us that in the desert our forefathers relied on the clouds of G-d’s glory to protect them against nature and its inclemency, instead of relying on a man made roof. (Talmud Sukkah folio 11)",
                    "All regular residents in Israel are to dwell in a sukkah during the festival. One might think that this obligation does not apply to foreigners, as they might not have a permanent residence. However, the commandment is applicable to both citizens and foreigners living in Israel, even if they have large and luxurious dwellings. This festival was established at the time of the grain harvest and the pressing of the wine, which might lead people to become proud and boastful about their homes that are filled with abundance. They might even believe that their wealth and success are solely due to their own efforts. By dwelling in a sukkah during this time, people are reminded to give praise and thanks to the One who has provided them with their inheritance and homes filled with all that is good. This acts as a reminder of the true source of their blessings and keeps them humble and grateful."

The three cities of refuge therefore symbolically divided the land into three sections. You will note that the center section therefore was shorter than the northern and southern section respectively. This is accounted for in the minds of the sages by the fact that both Chevron and Sh’chem were cities in which a lot of bloodshed occurred. They quote a verse in Hosea 6,9, as supporting their interpretation.",
