        "Introduction": [
            "1. Said Isaac the son of Liadi, a prince and a great one in Israel, Don Judah Abarbanel, from the stock of Jesse the Beth-lehemi, from the seed of David the officer and commander of the nation, from the scattered and   divided nation, the exiles of Jerusalem who are in Spain.",
            "2. Behold what chanced upon me in the course of writing the interpretation of the books (i.e. Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings) the opposite of the fate of Hiel of the House of Eli (I Kings 16:34) who rebuilt Jericho’s foundations with his eldest and with his youngest, he hung the doors.  In the early days (which were better than these), I was silent about my guards in the Kingdom of Portugal, the land of my birth, addressed my mouth to G-d to interpret these four volumes for I had seen there the interpretations were sparse. The debts of the king and his officers wove a yoke upon my neck that I could not meet, until the hand of G-d meddled with me. The King of Portugal thought me his enemy for ?I was not violent? and he stood, planted at my right like an enemy to attack me without cause and to seize all I owned, enduring wealth and success and ??? but that I fled to the Kingdom of Castilla like before the deadly sword. When I came there, I was like a strange in the land, a guest searching for a place to rest. I understood that G-d was telling me to complete my ???? and I interpreted the three first volumes, Joshua, for G-d had delivered me and saved me from the sword of Pharaoh, and Judges for G-d judged on Earth to decide my cases, and fight my fights with a violent thief and Samuel, for from G-d I have been answered. All this was in the beginning of the year 244 of the sixth millennium of Creation.",
            "3. The first introduction in the matters of the kings memorialized in this book and it appropriate that we discuss ten topics: The first topic is the ??? according to their dates. For of the kings mentioned in these books, only a few ruled the whole nations: Shual, David, and Solomon who reigned over all the tribes united. You will see that all three were Men of Valor, G-d fearing and Men of Truth. As I explained in the Book of Samuel that the reigns summed to 100 years, keep this memory aid to hand (Kings 1, 20:31) \"Magnanimous kings are they\" for 'Melchi' adds to 100. These kings were unique in reigning over all the tribes without divisions because once the kingdom was divided in the days of Rechavem and Yeravam. King Rechavam and all the progeny of House of David ruled over the tribes of Yehuda and Binyamin, majority of the tribe of Levi and the fraction of the tribe of Shimon whose patrimony was amid the patrimony of the sons of Yehuda. You will see in their stories, which of them walked in peace and wealth along the path of their father, David and which among them ?betrayed? G-d and went wayward to serve other gods. The length of the reign of the Kings of Judah, good and bad, was 393 years. A hint to this (Proverbs 15:3) \"The eyes of G-d observe both bad and good, since the words 'raim and tovim' sum to 393 [translator's note: the gemateria is 392 +1 for the phrase] ",
            "4. The Kings of All Jews:",

            "14. Achizahu his son reigned in the year 3058 from Creation and ruled in Jerusalem one year. In his days Jehoshua was High Priest and Elisha the Prophet.",
            "15 Atalia the mother of Achizyahu seized the kingdom in the year 3950 of Creation and destroyed the royal descendants and reigned 6 years. In her days, Yehoyahu, her father-in-law, was the High Priest and Elisha the Problem. Her reign overlapped the reign of Yoash. ",

                    "The first topic retells  how David made Shlomo his son king during his life because of the matter of Adoniyahu and what he [ David] commanded him [Shlomo] before his death and the matters of his burial. The beginning of the topic “and the King David was old…” and ends with “and Adoniyah the son of Chagit came to Bat Sheva…” and now I have asked six question as is my way. ",
                    "The first question is what I asked in the general introduction that I wrote to the Book of Joshua, namely why does this book begin with the affairs of David in his old age and his commands to Solomon before his death? These would more appropriately recounted in the Book of Samuel which is dedicated to David’s history and would be completed with his death and begin the Book of Kings with Solomon and his recounting. Why is it fit to discuss in this place? "
