                        "... Without a doubt, as Noach and his children left the boat they were desolate, grieving for the past, ‎and fearful, frightened of the future. This was for four reasons: 1. They mourned the death of their ‎relatives and friends, all of their intimates … 2. They were fearful, frightened of the predatory ‎beasts. When they had been in a political body before, then when a beast came, as in an ambush, ‎many people gathered to kill it … 3. They were anxious, saying, “What shall we eat? We lack the ‎tree fruit which were given as food for Adam, and we lack fruit of the land from which to eat … 4. ‎They feared lest strife and quarrels befall brothers, and lest they kill each other as Kayin had killed ‎Hevel … ‎And when G-d saw that they were desolate for the past and anxious for the future, He addressed ‎their hearts regarding each of these four matters, and He blessed them in ways that matched each ‎of the thoughts in their hearts [in Bereishit 9:1-7].‎ For the first [thought], the lack of relatives and friends who had died in the flood, He told them, ‎‎“Bear fruit and multiply and fill the land.” Meaning: You shall generate relatives and friends from ‎your progeny, and they will be more lovingly loyal than strangers. It is as though He had said, “I will ‎give you great procreative capacity, so that the land will quickly fill up with your children.”‎ For the second thought, their fear of predatory beasts, He said, “And your fear and terror will be ‎upon all of the beasts of the land, and all of the birds of the heavens.” For the human form has a ‎natural domination and authority over all living creatures… “In your hand they have been placed,” ‎meaning to say that  [the animals] had acquired humility and domestication before human beings ‎on the boat, and this would remain.‎‏ ‏For the third thought, the lack of food, He said, “All crawling ‎creatures that live are for you to eat,” as if to say, “If you lack fruit to eat, take your food from the ‎living.”…‎‏ ‏And for the fourth thought, their fear of themselves lest they kill each other, He said, “But ‎only, your blood for your lives I will demand.”‎"
