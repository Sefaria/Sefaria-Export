And the Lord tested him, whether it would be difficult in his eyes to do anything that the Lord would command him about [Issac], to the point that it would become the cause for him to understand this statement other than what is understood from it upon immediate consideration - meaning to say that that which is understood from it is that he should offer up another burnt-offering, not that he should slaughter his son..."

And they then said to him - according to what I think - that if he refused to send away the people, the dirt of the ground would be struck with the rod that was in their hands and it would become lice. And when he refused to send them away, Moses then commanded Aaron that he should strike the dirt of the ground and it become lice in all the Land of Egypt - as was their custom in the previous plagues. For they would only bring the plagues for the purpose of his sending away the Children of Israel from Egypt."

                    "<b>And the Lord drove back the Sea...:</b> It is appropriate that you should know that when God does miracles, He makes efforts to find causes for them such that they will reduce some of [the miracles] divergence from nature - as was [discussed] earlier. And we have already explained this in the sixth [section] of the Wars of the Lord. And for the cause here, God found to put a strong easterly wind in the way of the miracle - which would dry up and displace the water to the western side, in such a way that a [dry] place would newly reveal itself to them. And the waters of the Sea were on its right and on its left, since that [dry] place was higher. And because of that, it became perfectly revealed, while water remained to its right and its left. And this is what was intended about them, when it stated (14:29), \"and the waters were a wall for them on their right and on their left\" - not that the waters were high to their right and to their left, and that they [no longer] flowed. As if the matter were like that, He would not bring an easterly wind to create this miracle. And nevertheless, the waters were higher on the western side, since the wind displaced them there and would constantly prevent them from flowing. And that is why God brought a strong easterly wind the whole night. And behold, it called the waters, \"a wall\" - even though they were not high - because they prevented the Egyptians from coming against them from their right or left. And they could only go behind them. And the cloud was [similarly] a wall between them from behind [the Israelites]."

                    "This appearance is accompanied by a burnt offering, as it says: \"shall not be seen before My face empty-handed\". The three times mentioned here are the festivals of Passover, Shavuot and Sukkot. The purpose of this appearance is to see the form of the Temple, which indicates the existence of God, and the great mysteries that exist, as we will explain in due course - if God decrees. It is for this reason that there is a commandment to sacrifice to God at the moment of appearance, and so too is the reason for the Chagigah sacrifice at that point, to show that one should be joyful and celebrate that he has merited to serve God and to comprehend Him according to his ability, because this is the essence of perfection, and the essence of joy, as was explained in its place[...]   Now, the blind man is exempt from the sacrifice, as it says “Be seen before the face of the Lord your God”, and this word here implies [a mutual act], each one seeing the other. The fullness of seeing is with both eyes, and therefore even one who is blind in one eye is exempt from this offering. The text says ‘to be seen’, in the niphal form, rather than [the active] ‘to see’, to imply that as we see Him, so does He see us and notice us. In general, it is well-understood that we are not actually obliged to go to the Temple in order that God see us, for His “eyes range over the entire earth”! Rather, our pilgrimage is in order to see Him, inasmuch as is possible for us, and this in turn will be a cause for Him seeing us."
