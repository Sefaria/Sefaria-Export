However, in the seven days of creation, darkness and light alternated between day and night. And in Bereshit Rabbah, it is said that from the fourth day onward, the light of the sun and moon shone immediately. As for the phrase \"like the light of seven days,\" it is a way of speaking in the world to express that something is kept hidden for the seven days of celebration, even if it cannot be revealed to everyone, but is only brought out during those seven days of celebration. Similarly, the light of the seven days is like the light that existed during some of those days."
