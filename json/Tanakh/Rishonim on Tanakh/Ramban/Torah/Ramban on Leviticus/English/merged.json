            "‘VAYIKRA’ (AND HE CALLED).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., <i>And G-d called unto Moses</i>. — The third book of the Torah thus receives its title from the first Hebrew word of the book. The English title Leviticus is derived from the Septuagint — the first Greek translation of the Bible — which gave it that name because a major part of the book is devoted to the laws relating to the priests and Levites. In the Talmud and related literature it is called Torath Kohanim (Law of the Priests). This is to be distinguished from the early Rabbinic commentary on the book, known also as Torath Kohanim. See further, Notes 65, 73, and 121.</i> This book is the law of the priests and the Levites.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 25:32: <i>But as for the cities of the Levites</i> etc.</i> In it G-d explains matters concerned with all the offerings and watching over the Tabernacle [that it should not become defiled].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 15:31: <i>Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile My Tabernacle that is in the midst of them</i>. The reference could not be to the actual guarding of the Tabernacle done by the priests and Levites every night throughout the night, (see “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 31-32), for that duty is mentioned in the Book of Numbers (18:4). It may possibly be also a hint to the special Service on the Day of Atonement which was designed to atone for any uncleanness that may have occurred in the Tabernacle or any part thereof (see further 16:16, and 33). By bringing the prescribed offerings on that day Israel fulfilled its duty of “watching over the Tabernacle” that it should not continue in its state of defilement but instead should be restored to its pristine purity and holiness.</i> This is because one book [i.e., the second book of the Torah] was dedicated to the Egyptian exile and the redemption therefrom, and He completed it with an account of the building of the Tent of Meeting and the Glory of G-d which filled the Tabernacle,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 40:34.</i> therefore He now commanded Moses about the offerings and about watching over the Tabernacle, in order that the offerings effect atonement for [the children of] Israel, and that their sins should not bring about the removal of the Divine Glory. Thus He commanded <i>the priests that come near unto the Eternal</i> that <i>they sanctify themselves</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 19:22.</i> warning them against defilement of the Sanctuary and its hallowed offerings,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ramban further, 5:2.</i> and also that they are not <i>to break through to come up unto the Eternal</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 19:24. Ramban’s thought there is clearly based on his exposition [at the beginning of <i>Seder Terumah</i> — <i>ibid.</i>, 25:1, Vol. II, pp. 435-436] that the Tabernacle constituted a continuation of the presence of the Divine Glory which had descended upon Mount Sinai. Ramban therefore continues here to show that the strictures which applied at the time of the Revelation find their parallels in the laws concerning the Tabernacle.</i> just as He said, <i>Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within the veil, before the ark-cover which is upon the ark, that he die not; for I appear in the cloud upon the ark-cover</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 16:2.</i> which is similar to the warning [given at the Revelation] <i>lest they break through unto the Eternal to gaze, and many of them perish</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 19:21.</i> After that<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., in the Book of Numbers (5:1-3). See Ramban there on Verse 2.</i> He set limits to the Tabernacle, even as He had marked off Mount Sinai when the Glory of the G-d of Israel was there.",
            "Thus the greatest part of this book deals with the offerings, the laws of the offering itself and of those who perform its rite and of the place where it is to be brought; some commandments are also mentioned incidentally to those dealing with the offerings. Thus at first He commanded concerning the freewill offerings,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Freewill offerings are those which can be brought at any time by any individual. These include: the burnt-offering (Chapter 1), the meal-offering (Chapter 2), and the peace-offering (Chapter 3). On the other hand, the sin-offering (Chapter 4) and the guilt-offering (Chapter 5:14-26) can be brought only to expiate certain sins if committed unintentionally, and therefore are not freewill offerings.</i> and prohibited the eating of fat and blood on account of [mentioning] them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 3:17.</i> Following that He commanded concerning the offerings that are to be brought upon committing a sin,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Chapters 4-5.</i> and incidentally to these He mentioned the laws of forbidden foods;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Chapter 11.</i> for they defile the person, and he who eats them or touches them must not touch any hallowed thing, nor come into the Sanctuary, and if he does go in there [or eat of the hallowed things] while in a state of uncleanness, he has to bring the offering of higher or lower value<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This offering was so called [the offering of higher or lower value] because it did not have to be of one specified kind, but varied in accordance with the means of the transgressor who has to offer it. See in my translation of Rambam’s “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 82-83.</i> which He had already mentioned.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 5:1-13.</i> After that it was necessary to mention the law of the leper<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Chapters 13-14.</i> and the ordinances of the woman in childbirth<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Chapter 12.</i> and of the <i>zav</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A man suffering a flux. <i>Ibid.</i>, 15:1-15.</i> and <i>zavah</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A woman suffering a flux outside her menstrual period. <i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 25-30.</i> in order to tell that they must bring an offering [at the end of the period of their uncleanness], and to warn them further concerning their uncleanness — as He said at the end [of these laws], <i>Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile My Tabernacle that is in the midst of them</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 31.</i> As a result of mentioning these laws, He warned afterwards about those persons with whom it is forbidden to have sexual relations,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Chapter 18.</i> since association with them defiles, and their sin is called “defilement”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 24: <i>Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things</i>.</i> and brings about the removal of the Divine Glory, and exile.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 26:31-32.</i> Besides, he who commits any of these sins [of forbidden sexual relations] unwillfully, must bring the sin-offering which He mentioned already in the verse, <i>And if anyone sin through error</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 4:27.</i> Following that He mentioned the commandment of the Sabbath and the appointed seasons of the Eternal<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Chapter 23.</i> on account of the offerings [which are brought on those days], just as He said, <i>These are the appointed seasons of the Eternal</i> etc. <i>to bring an offering made by fire unto the Eternal</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 37.</i> In most of the sections of this book He speaks with reference to the priests: <i>Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 22:18.</i> <i>Command Aaron and his sons</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 6:2.</i> In the section of <i>Kedoshim</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chapters 19-20.</i> however, there are some commandments addressed to the children of Israel, but most of them are mentioned because of some connection with the offerings or matters similar to them.

                    "AND HE CALLED UNTO MOSES; AND THE ETERNAL SPOKE UNTO HIM. Scripture states [the fact that G-d called to Moses] here and not in other places, because <i>Moses was not able to enter into the Tent of Meeting</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 40:35.</i> and to draw near the place <i>where G-d was</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 20:18.</i> except through G-d calling him [to come into the Tent of Meeting]. For Moses had already been told, <i>and I will speak with thee from above the ark-cover;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 25:22.</i> <i>where I will meet with thee</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 30:36.</i> Since he knew that <i>the Eternal that sitteth upon the cherubim</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Chronicles 13:6.</i> was there, Moses was afraid to come into the Tent at all until He called him, just as it was at Mount Sinai where it is said, <i>and on the seventh day He called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 24:16. See also Note 7 above.</i> Or it may be that Moses did not know that the Glory of G-d was in the Tent and that the communication to him would be from there,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For Moses thought that he would hear the Divine Voice speaking to him from above the ark-cover, but actually the Holy One, blessed be He, would be speaking from heaven (Abohab). See also Ramban on Exodus 40:2, Vol. II, p. 619.</i> since the cloud did not cover the Tent of Meeting until the eighth day of the installation according to the opinion of our Rabbis;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“<i>And it came to pass, on the eighth day</i> … (Further 9:1). This was the first of Nisan, and the day was distinguished in ten different ways … It was the day on which the Divine Glory dwelt for the first time among the Israelites …” (Torath Kohanim, <i>ibid.</i>).</i> and after this call Moses came into the innermost part of the Tent [i.e., the Holy of Holies], just as the Rabbis have interpreted:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim at the beginning of <i>Parshath Acharei</i>, (further, 16:2): “<i>Thy brother</i> [Aaron] is under the command not to enter the holy place [except when it was his duty to officiate there], (further 16:2), but Moses is not included in this command.”</i> “Aaron was not to enter [the Sanctuary except at the prescribed time], but Moses was not included in this command.” This is the plain meaning of this verse. I have explained it already above.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 40:34.</i><br>But our Rabbis have said<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Vayikra</i> 1:7.</i> that “all communications [that came to Moses], whether they are introduced by the word <i>dabeir</i> (speak), or by <i>emor</i> (say), or <i>tzav</i> (command), were preceded by a call,” that is to say, G-d said to him, ‘<i>Moses, Moses</i>’ and he answered, ‘<i>Here am I</i>.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 3:4.</i> This was a way of expressing affection and encouragement to Moses.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Accordingly, the call to Moses that is mentioned at the beginning of this book was not for the purpose of giving him permission to come into the Tent of Meeting, but rather to express G-d’s affection for Moses and His inspiriting him for the communication. If so, it stands to reason, Ramban continues, that this kind of call [“Moses, Moses”] came to him on all occasions when he received a Divine communication. The reason why it is mentioned specifically here, etc. (see text).</i> Now according to this opinion, Scripture mentioned the expression [<i>And He called unto him</i> …] here, because it was the first communication that came to Moses from the Tent of Meeting, thus teaching us concerning all the other communications that such was His procedure with him all the time and with the whole Torah. The expression <i>out of the Tent of Meeting</i> refers according to the Rabbis to the preceding words, [the interpretation of the verse thus being]: “and He called unto him out of the Tent of Meeting; and the Eternal spoke to him in the Tent,” for Moses was already there [in the Tent].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For since the purpose of the call was not to give permission to Moses to enter, but rather to show him affection, the sense of the verse may then be explained as follows: “and G-d called him out of the Tent and He spoke to him in the Tent” where he already was.</i> The explanation of the verse according to its plain meaning and sense is: “and the Eternal called unto Moses and spoke unto him, out of the Tent of Meeting.”<br>By way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], this verse is like, <i>And unto Moses He said: ‘Come up unto the Eternal.’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 24:1.</i> Its secret is known from the Revelation on Mount Sinai<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Note 17 in <i>Seder Yithro</i> (Vol. II, p. 251).</i> and the Ten Commandments. I have alluded to it already.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 24:1.</i>"

                    "WHEN ANY MAN BRINGETH OF YOU AN OFFERING UNTO THE ETERNAL OF THE CATTLE. The meaning of this verse is as follows: “when any man of you brings from the cattle an offering to the Eternal, of the herd or of the flock you shall bring it.” The reason for this command is that since He commanded afterwards concerning fowl-offerings<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verses 14-17.</i> and meal-offerings,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Chapter 2.</i> He said here that when a man brings an offering of cattle, he must bring it of one of these two kinds [herd and flock], but not a wild beast nor any other cattle. Thus he who offers a beast [as an offering to G-d], violates a prohibition which is derived from a positive commandment [and carries the force of a positive commandment], just as the Rabbis have said in the third chapter of Tractate Zebachim:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zebachim 34a.</i> “Rabbi Yochanan said: one who offers the limbs of a [kosher] beast [upon the altar of G-d] transgresses a positive commandment.”",
                    "‘TAKRIVU’ (YE SHALL BRING). This teaches that two [or more] persons may bring a freewill burnt-offering in partnership. YOUR OFFERING. This teaches that a burnt-offering may be brought as a freewill offering of the [entire] public [not only of groups of individuals]. This refers to the burnt-offering of the altar’s summertime<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When there was a lack of private offerings [due to the long summer days], freewill burnt-offerings were supplied from the surplus of the half-shekels of the previous year.</i> which was supplied from the surplus [of the half-shekels of the past year].” This is Rashi’s language.<br>The meaning of the Rabbi’s interpretation is thus to state that if many persons voluntarily offer to bring a burnt-offering, it thereby becomes a burnt-offering of partners, for what difference is there between two persons who combine to bring an offering, and ten or a thousand who associate to do so? But the burnt-offering for the altar’s summer-time which is supplied from the surplus [of the previous year’s half-shekels], is deemed a “burnt-offering of the public” because the authorities [of the Sanctuary who receive the donations for the offerings] do so with the implied condition [that they may spend them at their discretion, and the burnt-offering of the public is distinguished in certain respects from a burnt-offering of partners]. Thus according to Rashi all burnt-offerings that are brought by many persons — except those which come from the surplus of the half-shekels — have the law of burnt-offerings of partners, and they all require the laying of [their owners’] hands upon the offering,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Verse 4.</i> and the libations connected with them<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Numbers 15:3-12.</i> are taken from the owners [while “burnt-offerings of the public” need no laying of hands, and the libations are supplied by the Temple treasury]. Perhaps according to the opinion of Rashi it is permitted for the general public to offer [money] beforehand in order to bring a burnt-offering of fowls, which may be brought as a freewill offering by two [or more] persons but may [never] come as a freewill offering of the public, and similarly they [may combine to bring] a peace-offering, concerning which the Sages have said<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Vayikra</i> 6:6.</i> that it may be brought by partners as a freewill offering but may not be brought by the public<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Peace-offerings of the public were only brought on the Festival of Shevuoth (see further, 23:19).</i> — and in that case it is called “a burnt-offering of partners,” or “a peace-offering of partners.” They [i.e., the burnt-offering of fowls and the peace-offering], were only excluded in that they cannot be brought from the [money of the] baskets [containing the surplus of half-shekels which were already donated by the public for the general upkeep of the offerings, and not specifically donated for a burnt-offering or peace-offering].<br>We may possibly say that if the public wanted originally to set aside a fund for freewill offerings, and they collected it [for that purpose] as they collected the <i>shekalim</i> for the Daily [public] Offerings and the Additional Offerings [of Sabbaths and festivals], that there may then be a freewill public-offering of the cattle,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, the freewill public burnt-offering for the altar’s summertime need not be limited exclusively to that brought out of the surplus in the baskets containing the previous year’s shekels. Money may be collected originally from the public for the purpose of bringing a freewill offering, and the offering will have the status of a public-offering in the sense that [like a public burnt-offering] it will not need the laying of hands on it, which is required in the case of an individual offering. Thus Ramban differs from Rashi’s opinion above that even the combination of a large group of individuals does not alter the status of the offering, which remains an offering of individual partners. Or it may be that Ramban means that even according to Rashi, if the community agreed beforehand, and the money was not left to be donated individually, but collected in the same way that the <i>shekalim</i> were collected, it thereby gains the status of a public-offering. Hence Ramban’s expression: “We may possibly say”, i.e., in explanation of Rashi.</i> and it will not require the laying of hands on it, being that it is included in this verse [as a public offering]. As long as it is the majority of Israel who donated money to that end, the offering is called “a freewill offering of the public.” [This rule applies only to the freewill burnt-offering of the cattle] but does not apply to the burnt-offering of fowls, nor to the peace-offering. But if a minority of the people donated towards the freewill burnt-offering, [even if they are a large group], they are deemed as individuals [who bring such an offering in partnership, which would thus require the laying on it of the owners’ hands, and the libations would have to be supplied by the owners]. This is the correct explanation."

In the case of the goat designed to be sent [to Azazel] it is expressly stated, <i>And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 16:21.</i> If so, I do not know why Scripture wrote “his hand” [in the singular] in all other cases of the laying of hands. Perhaps it is for the purpose of deriving therefrom what the Rabbis have interpreted:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Menachoth 93b.</i> “<i>His hand</i> — and not the hand of his proxy.” For had it been written “his hands” [in the plural we would have interpreted it] to require the laying of both hands, and we would not have been able to exclude the proxy. But now that [we derive from other verses that] both hands must be laid upon the offering, [we must conclude that] He only wrote the singular [indicating the hands of only one person], to exclude a proxy, for although a man’s proxy is like the man himself<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kiddushin 41b.</i> in all other places, we should not consider him so in the case of the laying of hands.

                    "AND IT SHALL BE FAVORABLY ACCEPTED FOR HIM TO MAKE ATONEMENT FOR HIM. “For what kind of sins does [the freewill burnt-offering] effect atonement for the person that brings it? Should you say, for sins [where punishment if wilfully committed] is excision, or any of the [four] deaths imposed by the court, or death by the hands of Heaven, or stripes, the punishment for all these sins is already stated, [and atonement is affected by those punishments, and therefore not by this offering]! You must conclude that [the freewill burnt-offering] effects atonement only for transgression of a positive commandment,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Torah cites no punishment for failure to fulfill a positive commandment [with the two exceptions of not slaughtering the Passover-offering, and not being circumcised]. If a person thus failed to fulfill a positive commandment — such as dwelling in a booth on the Festival of Succoth — his bringing a freewill burnt-offering effects atonement for this sin.</i> and for the violation of a negative commandment that is juxtaposed to a positive commandment.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">64</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A case in point is the prohibition against taking an entire bird’s nest, with the mother-bird and its young (Deuteronomy 22:6). If, however, he did infringe upon the law, he is obliged to observe a positive commandment that the Torah stated next to the prohibition — <i>Thou shalt in any wise let the dam go</i> (<i>ibid.</i>, Verse 7). Hence the usual punishment of stripes is not incurred for infringing the negative commandment, since the positive commandment “remedies” the prohibition. Yet it needs atonement, and the bringing of the burnt-offering expiates for it. — It is important to note that during the laying of hands on the offering the owner, in case of sin-offerings, confessed the sin for which he brought the offering, and so also in the case of guilt-offerings. Similarly, on bringing a burnt-offering he confessed the transgression for a positive commandment etc. [as explained here in the text]. In the case of the peace-offering, he uttered words of praise to G-d (Mishneh Torah, <i>Hilchoth Ma’asei Korbanoth</i> 3:14-15).</i> This is Rashi’s language, and it is a Beraitha<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Beraitha (literally: “outside”) is a teaching or tradition of the Tannaim that had been excluded from the Mishnah and incorporated in other collections.

Where is “the punishment” for these sins already stated, since offerings only effect atonement for unwilful violations?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">67</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Punishments” [such as “excision etc.”] are incurred only for <i>wilful</i> violation of the negative commandments, while offerings for atonement are brought only for <i>unwilful</i> violations. So how could Rashi state, “Should you say [that the freewill burnt-offering is brought] for such sins that make one liable to excision etc., the punishment for those sins has already been stated”? Where are those “punishments” for <i>unwilful</i> violations mentioned? For <i>unwilful</i> violations no punishments are ever incurred!</i> Now we could say that [the freewill burnt-offerings] atone for those unwilful sins which the penalty [if committed wilfully] is death by the hands of Heaven, or stripes, or any of the [four] deaths imposed by the court, in such cases that do not obligate one to bring a sin-offering,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The general rule is that a sin-offering is brought only for such a sin unwilfully committed for which the penalty if committed wilfully would be excision. Ramban is thus suggesting: we could say that the freewill burnt-offering atones for those unwilful sins for which the penalty is death by the hands of Heaven etc., and for all those sins for which the penalty is death by the court and yet do <i>not</i> require the bringing of a sin-offering for unwilful violation. Examples follow in the text.</i> such as smiting one’s father or mother, or cursing them,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reason why the sin-offering is not brought for the unwilful violation of these negative commandments is that the punishment of excision is not incurred in case of the wilful violation thereof. See Note 68 above.</i> just as the sin-offering atones for the unwilful sins for which the penalty [if committed wilfully] is excision. But perhaps it appeared to the Sages that since Scripture expressly states the punishment for both the wilful and unwilful commission of sins punishable by death imposed by the hands of the court or by excision, [stating that if committed wilfully, the sinner is liable to one of the above punishments, and if committed unwilfully, he must bring a sin-offering], and it further set forth the punishment of those liable to death by the hands of Heaven or stripes for certain sins, if committed wilfully, but did not mention in these [last two categories] any punishment if the sins are committed unwilfully — therefore it appeared [to the Sages] that Scripture had completely set forth their case.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus Scripture made it clear that in the case of those sins for which the penalty is death by the hands of Heaven or stripes if committed wilfully — no offering for expiation is needed when committed unintentionally. Rashi and the Torath Kohanim were thus correct in stating that the burnt-offering could not effect atonement for these unwilful sins, since “the punishments” have already been stated in Scripture both for wilful and unwilful sins, and therefore we could not say that the burnt-offering effects atonement for the above-mentioned sins if committed unwilfully.</i> For why should Scripture have explained the punishment of some sins if committed either wilfully or unwilfully, and explained the punishment for other sins [only] if committed wilfully, but not if committed unwilfully, and did not say that he is obligated to bring a burnt-offering? Therefore the Sages concluded that in the case of those sins for which one is liable to death by the hands of Heaven or stripes, they are only punishable if committed wilfully, as explained in Scripture, but if committed unwilfully there is no burden of sin at all and they do not need any atonement. This is the meaning of the saying of the Rabbis [in the Torath Kohanim<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim <i>Vayikra</i> 4:5.</i> mentioned by Rashi]: “their punishment has already been stated,” meaning that Scripture had already stated the whole punishment that G-d desired to impose on them. But for the wilful transgression of a positive commandment<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Torah cites no punishment for failure to fulfill a positive commandment [with the two exceptions of not slaughtering the Passover-offering, and not being circumcised]. If a person thus failed to fulfill a positive commandment — such as dwelling in a booth on the Festival of Succoth — his bringing a freewill burnt-offering effects atonement for this sin.</i> and for the violation of a negative commandment that is juxtaposed to a positive commandment,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">64</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A case in point is the prohibition against taking an entire bird’s nest, with the mother-bird and its young (Deuteronomy 22:6). If, however, he did infringe upon the law, he is obliged to observe a positive commandment that the Torah stated next to the prohibition — <i>Thou shalt in any wise let the dam go</i> (<i>ibid.</i>, Verse 7). Hence the usual punishment of stripes is not incurred for infringing the negative commandment, since the positive commandment “remedies” the prohibition. Yet it needs atonement, and the bringing of the burnt-offering expiates for it. — It is important to note that during the laying of hands on the offering the owner, in case of sin-offerings, confessed the sin for which he brought the offering, and so also in the case of guilt-offerings. Similarly, on bringing a burnt-offering he confessed the transgression for a positive commandment etc. [as explained here in the text]. In the case of the peace-offering, he uttered words of praise to G-d (Mishneh Torah, <i>Hilchoth Ma’asei Korbanoth</i> 3:14-15).</i> where Scripture mentioned no punishment whatever, and it is impossible that no penalty should be inflicted for them at all, in these cases the sinner is atoned for by this burnt-offering, if he brought it of his own freewill.<br>It is possible to say that because He did not use in the case of the freewill offerings<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 5:18.</i> the expression: “to make atonement for him concerning the error which he committed,” as He said with reference to the offerings brought for sins committed unwilfully,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 5:18.</i> and instead He said, <i>and it shall be favorably accepted</i>, it appeared to our Rabbis that the meaning thereof is that [the burnt-offering] effects atonement for those who wilfully commit certain sins, seeing that these persons are not [hitherto] favorably accepted by Him. For he who commits a sin unwilfully is yet, in spite of his sin, considered favorably accepted by G-d. If so, it is impossible that the burnt-offering effect atonement for wilful sinners except for those who transgress a positive commandment or a negative commandment that is juxtaposed to a positive commandment, in which cases no punishment has been mentioned in Scripture, but they are not pleasing to G-d because they violated His commandment. With what can these men become favorably accepted by their Master?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">72</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See I Samuel 29:4.</i> With this gift!<br>I have seen in the Agadah,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">73</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Agadah (homily) comprises all subjects in Rabbinical literature which do not aim directly at the exposition of the <i>laws</i> of the Torah, but which teach and edify on all subjects concerning the Torah. The Agadic literature is contained primarily in the Midrashim, as well as in the Talmud. It would appear that Ramban uses the term Agadah here in contradistinction to the Torath Kohanim previously mentioned, which is primarily a book of <i>Halachah</i> (law). There in the Torath Kohanim the purpose of the burnt-offering is as explained above; in the Agadah — in Vayikra Rabbah — it is assigned another purpose, as explained further on.</i> in Vayikra Rabbah:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">74</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Vayikra Rabbah 7:3.</i> “Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai taught: The burnt-offering only comes to effect atonement for sinful thoughts of the heart. Said Rabbi Levi: It is a clear Biblical text: ‘<i>V’ha’olah al ruchachem</i>’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">75</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew term for the burnt-offering is <i>olah</i> [literally, “comes up”]. There is thus here a suggestion that the <i>olah</i> is for those sinful thoughts “which come into one’s mind.”</i> (<i>And that which cometh into your mind</i>) <i>shall not be at all</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">76</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 20:32.</i> — the <i>olah</i> (burnt-offering) effects atonement for those things which come into your mind. Similarly it says of Job: <i>and he offered burnt-offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said, ‘It may be that my sons have sinned, and blasphemed G-d in their hearts</i>.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">77</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 1:5.</i> This proves that the burnt-offering only comes to effect atonement for sinful thoughts of the heart.” The reason why [the burnt-offering was singled out for this purpose] is because it is a sin that no one recognizes except G-d [Who knows our secret thoughts]; therefore it is wholly burnt to G-d.<br>The expression <i>v’nirtzah lo</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">78</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Up to here we have followed Silberman’s translation of the phrase: “and it shall be favorably accepted for him.” Ramban now suggests three new interpretations: 1) “and he will be favorably accepted by Him.” 2) “and the sin will be completed to him” — never to be mentioned again. 3) “and it will be ‘agreeable’ to Him.”</i> refers back to <i>the Glorious Name</i> mentioned [in the preceding verse: <i>to the door of the Tent of Meeting he shall bring it for his acceptance before the Eternal</i>], meaning that he should be favorably accepted by Him through this offering which effects atonement for him. This is similar in expression to these verses: <i>for wherewith should this fellow ‘yithratzeh’</i> (<i>reconcile himself</i>) <i>unto his lord?;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">79</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 29:4.</i> <i>and the light of Thy countenance because ‘r’tzitham’</i> (<i>Thou wast favorable to them</i>),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">80</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 44:4.</i> and many others. It is possible that <i>v’nirtzah</i> is a by-word for the sin, meaning that the sin is finished for him, so that he may now be forgiven, similar to these expressions: ‘<i>ki nirtzah avonah</i>’ (<i>that her guilt is paid off</i>);<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">81</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 40:2.</i> <i>until the land ‘rotz’thah’</i> (<i>had been paid</i>) <i>her Sabbaths</i>;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">82</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Chronicles 36:21.</i> <i>and they ‘yirtzu’</i> (<i>shall be paid</i>) <i>the punishment of their iniquity</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">83</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 26:43.</i> — all these being expressions of completion. It is further possible to say in line with the first interpretation, that the sin will be as if it were “agreeable” [not objectionable before G-d], meaning that His anger will no longer be kindled against him."

This teaches that the slaughtering [of the offering] is valid if performed by a <i>zar</i> (non-priest). <i>‘V’hikrivu’</i> (<i>and they shall offer</i> …) — this refers to ‘receiving’ [the blood], and the sense thereof is the bringing [of the blood to the altar]. Thus we learn that both of them [receiving the blood and bringing it to the altar], are to be done by Aaron’s sons.” This is Rashi’s language.<br>But it is not correct.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">84</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban understood Rashi as saying that the word <i>v’hikrivu</i> has a primary meaning of “receiving” the blood in a vessel, which is the first process after the “slaughtering” mentioned immediately before in the verse, and a subsidiary meaning [from the root ‘<i>karav</i>’, to bring near] of “bringing” it to the altar. To this Ramban objects that ‘<i>v’hikrivu</i>’ is not derived from the root ‘<i>karav</i>’, implying bringing near, and hence cannot sustain the interpretation of “bringing it near” the altar even as a subsidiary meaning. Rather, it is associated with the word ‘<i>korban</i>’ (offering), and has only one meaning, that of “receiving” the blood, which is the first stage in offering. If so, whence do we know that bringing it near the altar may also be done only by priests [and is invalid if done by a non-priest]? To this Ramban replies that it is a logical deduction [“if receiving the blood may only be done by priests, it follows ‘all the more’ that bringing it to the altar, which is a later stage in its offering, has this requirement”]. A careful reading of Rashi and Ramban clearly indicates this interpretation.</i> Instead, the Midrash of our Rabbis states:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">85</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Vayikra</i> 4:4.</i> “<i>V’hikrivu</i> — this is the receiving of the blood.” For the term <i>v’hikrivu</i> does not mean the bringing of the blood near to the altar, namely the <i>holachah</i> (carrying of it). Instead, <i>v’hikrivu</i> is an expression similar to the word <i>korban</i> (offering) and it signifies receiving [of the blood in a vessel] and sprinkling it upon the altar. Thus He mentioned bringing it [to the door of the Tent of Meeting], laying hands on it, and slaughtering it with reference to the owner of the offering, and after the slaughtering He immediately mentioned the sons of Aaron. It accordingly follows that receiving the blood is in itself a duty to be performed by the priests, and may only be done by a qualified priest and with vessels dedicated to the Temple Service; and [it follows] all the more that bringing it to the altar and sprinkling it [can be done only by a qualified priest]. Moreover, even carrying of the limbs to the ramp [leading to the altar] is invalid if done by a non-priest, for so the Rabbis interpreted:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">86</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zebachim 4a.</i> “<i>And the priest shall offer it all, and cause it to ascend in fumes upon the altar</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">87</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 13.</i> — this refers to carrying of the limbs to the ramp.” If so, carrying the blood to the altar also may be done only by a priest with all the conditions of priesthood."

When he slaughters it he should slaughter it with the intention of [burning it by] fire, [as will be explained further on]. Wherever the word <i>isheih</i> occurs, it is an expression of fire. PLEASING — it is pleasing to Me that I have commanded and My will was done.” This is the language of Rashi.<br>Now the Rabbi did not explain what is meant by “the intention of [burning it by] fire.” In the Gemara<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">102</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zebachim 46b.</i> the Rabbis have said: “this is to exclude <i>kabobo</i>, which may not be done.” Now the commentators<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">103</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi <i>ibid</i>.</i> explained this to mean that he should slaughter it with the intention of placing it on flames burning the pile of wood upon the altar, and not of placing it upon dying coals which are in the process of being extinguished. To me it appears that the intention he needs to have is that the fire should burn it completely, and not that it should just be roasted there a little, the word <i>kabobo</i> being similar to the expression of the Rabbis in the chapter entitled “A stubborn and rebellious son: ”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">104</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 70a.</i> “<i>k’basar kiba</i> (like partly-roasted meat) which thieves eat.” In Tractate Erubin we also find:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">105</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Erubin 29b.</i> “<i>v’nichbeiv</i> (let him roast it) and eat it.” Now some books have a reading in Tractate Zebachim:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">102</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zebachim 46b.</i> “this is to exclude <i>gabobo</i> (straw), which may not be done.” Accordingly the meaning thereof is that he should have the intention to put it on a fire of wood, as it is written, <i>on the wood that is on the fire</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">106</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 12.</i> and he should not intend to put it upon a fire made of stubble and straw, similar to that which we have been taught [in a Mishnah]:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">107</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shabbath 36b.</i> “If a double-stove had been heated with stubble and <i>gabobo</i>.”<br>Now this verse mentions a reason for the offerings, namely, that they are <i>a fire-offering, of a pleasing odor unto the Eternal</i>. The Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] wrote in the Moreh Nebuchim<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">108</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Guide of the Perplexed III, 46.</i> that the reason for the offerings is because the Egyptians and the Chaldeans in whose lands the children of Israel were strangers and sojourners, used always to worship the herd and the flock, the Egyptians worshipping the sheep and the Chaldeans worshipping the demons whom they imagined as assuming the form of goats. To this day men of India never slaughter the herd. It was for this reason that He commanded [Israel] to slaughter these three species [of cattle: the herd, the flock, and the goats], to the Revered Name, so that it be known that the very act which the idol-worshippers considered to be the utmost sin [i.e., slaughtering the above species], that same act should be done as an offering before the Creator, and through it Israel’s sins would be forgiven. For such is the way to cure people of false beliefs, which are the diseasees of the human soul, for all diseases and sicknesses are healed by medicines which are antithetical to them. These are the words [the Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon], and he expounded them at great length.<br>But these words are mere expressions, healing casually a severe wound<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">109</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Jeremiah 6:14.</i> and a great difficulty, and making <i>the table of the Eternal polluted</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">110</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Malachi 1:12.</i> [as if the offerings were intended only] to remove false beliefs from the hearts of the wicked and fools of the world, when Scripture says that they are <i>the food of the offering made by fire, for a pleasing odor</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">111</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 3:16.</i> Moreover, [if the offerings were meant to eliminate] the foolish [ideas] of the Egyptians, their disease would not thereby be cured. On the contrary, it would increase the cause of sorrow, for since the intention of the above-mentioned wicked ones was to worship the constellations of the sheep and the ox, which according to their opinion possess certain powers [over human affairs], and which is why they abstain from eating them in deference to their power and strength, then if these species are slaughtered to the Revered Name, it is a mark of respect and honor to [these constellations]. These worshippers themselves were in the habit of so doing, as He has said, <i>And they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices unto the satyrs</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">112</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 17:7.</i> and those who made the [golden] calf sacrificed to it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">113</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 32:8. — In other words, despite the Torah commanding that these three animal species, [the herd, the flock, and the goats] should be offered up to G-d, idol-worshippers, who had other forms of deities, could still consider these offerings to be marks of honor to their own particular foolishness, as is evidenced by the fact that they used to sacrifice herd and flock to the goats, or to the calf! Thus how could the offerings specified in the Torah be a cure against all idols? This is the gist of Ramban’s argument. It is more readily understood in the light of Ramban’s explanation on the development of idolatry in Exodus Chapter 20, Verse 3, which indicates that the early idolators believed in a Supreme G-d. See also further, Note 117.</i> Now the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] mentions<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">108</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Guide of the Perplexed III, 46.</i> that the idol-worshippers used to sacrifice to the moon on the days of new-moon, and to the sun when it rose in a particular constellation known to them from their books. The disease of idolatry would surely have been far better cured if we were to eat [these animal-deities] to our full, which would be considered by them forbidden and repugnant, and something they would never do!<br>Furthermore, when Noah came out of the ark with his three sons, there were as yet no Chaldeans or Egyptians in the world, yet he brought an offering, which was pleasing to G-d, as concerning it Scripture says, <i>And the Eternal smelled the pleasing odor</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">114</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 8:21.</i> and on account of it <i>He said in His heart, ‘I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake.’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">114</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 8:21.</i> <i>Abel likewise brought of the first-born of his flock and of the fat thereof.

In other words, the fact that Balaam who was not commanded by the laws of the Torah, brought offerings of the herd and the flock, shows that G-d’s intent in commanding Israel that the offerings be brought from the three animal species was not to cure people of these evil idolatrous beliefs, as Balaam was not commanded therein.</i> then was not to eradicate from [Balak’s mind] evil beliefs, nor was he commanded to bring the offerings. Instead, Balaam did so in order to approach G-d so that he would be reached by His communication. The Scriptural expression concerning the offerings is, <i>My food which is presented unto Me for offerings made by fire, for a pleasing odor unto Me</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">118</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 28:2.</i> Far be it that they should have no other purpose and intention except the elimination of idolatrous opinions from the minds of fools!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">119</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This concludes Ramban’s array of arguments against Rambam’s rationale of the offerings. It is important to point out that many great authors came to Rambam’s defense, as there are many Scriptural and Rabbinical sources which seem to confirm his opinion, and the questions Ramban raised have been answered by them. A summary of them will be found in my Hebrew commentary, pp. 11-12. See there also for the unique approach of Rabbi Meir Simcha in harmonizing the theories of both Rambam and Ramban.</i><br>It is far more fitting to accept the reason for the offerings which scholars<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">120</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reference is to Ibn Ezra. This is clearly apparent in Ramban’s language in his sermon called Torath Hashem Temimah, where he writes: “Now the opinion of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra on the matter of the offerings is that they are an atonement for the soul. The explanation of the matter on the basis of his opinion is that the offerings …” (Kithvei Haramban, Vol. I, p. 164). It is thus clear that what follows is Ramban’s interpretation of the way he understood Ibn Ezra’s thought. This explains why the following exposition is not found verbatim in Ibn Ezra’s writings. See my Hebrew commentary (beginning with the third edition, p. 532).</i> say, namely that since man’s deeds are accomplished through thought, speech and action, therefore G-d commanded that when man sins and brings an offering, he should lay his hands upon it in contrast to the [evil] deed [committed]. He should confess his sin verbally in contrast to his [evil] speech, and he should burn the inwards and the kidneys [of the offering] in fire because they are the instruments of thought and desire in the human being. He should burn the legs [of the offering] since they correspond to the hands and feet of a person, which do all his work. He should sprinkle the blood upon the altar, which is analogous to the blood in his body. All these acts are performed in order that when they are done, a person should realize that he has sinned against his G-d with his body and his soul, and that “his” blood should really be spilled and “his” body burned, were it not for the loving-kindness of the Creator, Who took from him a substitute and a ransom, namely this offering, so that its blood should be in place of his blood, its life in place of his life, and that the chief limbs of the offering should be in place of the chief parts of his body. The portions [given from the sin-offering to the priests], are in order to support the teachers of the Torah, so that they pray on his behalf. The reason for the Daily public Offering is that it is impossible for the public [as a whole] to continually avoid sin. Now these are words which are worthy to be accepted, appealing to the heart as do words of Agadah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">73</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Agadah (homily) comprises all subjects in Rabbinical literature which do not aim directly at the exposition of the <i>laws</i> of the Torah, but which teach and edify on all subjects concerning the Torah.

It would appear that Ramban uses the term Agadah here in contradistinction to the Torath Kohanim previously mentioned, which is primarily a book of <i>Halachah</i> (law).

It does not say with reference to them <i>E-il</i> (G-d), nor <i>Elokecha</i> (thy G-d), nor <i>Elokim</i> (G-d), nor <i>Sha-dai</i> (Almighty), nor <i>Tze-baoth</i> (G-d of ‘Hosts’), but only, <i>Yod Hei</i> — the Proper name of G-d [the Tetragrammaton — ‘Eternal’] — in order not to give an opponent [i.e., a believer in plurality] an occasion for a point of attack.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">123</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“They will bring proof from the fact that a deity with such-and-such a name commanded that the meal-offering be brought to him, and a deity of another name commanded that the bullocks [be offered to him], and a deity of a third name commanded that the ram [be offered to him]” (Rashi <i>ibid.</i>), — In his work on the Torah “Meshech Chochmah” (at the beginning of <i>Seder Shoftim</i>) Rabbi Meir Simchah explains the intent of Shimon ben Azai’s words in the following pertinent way: “It is known that the name <i>Elokim</i> means Master of all (natural) forces, or the Force of forces (see Ramban, Vol. I, p. 25). Hence if the name <i>Elokim</i> or <i>E-il</i> had been used in the section of the offerings it would have given an opportunity to the opponents [of the belief in the true Unity of G-d] that He is in need of food [i.e., in need of replenishing His powers]. Therefore only the Tetragrammaton is used in this whole section in order to indicate that His Existence is the only true Existence, and that everything exists only through His true Existence, for they are all in need of Him, but He is not in need of them nor of any of them.”</i> Perhaps you might say that He is in need of food, Scripture therefore says, <i>If I were hungry, I would not tell thee; for the world is Mine, and the fullness thereof</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">124</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 50:12.</i> I have only commanded you to bring the offerings in order that My Will should be said and fulfilled.” In the beginning of Torath Kohanim we also find:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">125</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Vayikra</i> 2:5.</i> “Rabbi Yosei says: Wherever an offering is mentioned by Scripture, the Tetragrammaton is used, in order not to give an opportunity for heretics to rebel” [by finding pluralistic allusions against the principle of Unity]. These are the words of the Rabbis of blessed memory.<br>Now it is true that in the section of the Torah where the offerings are commanded it does not say <i>E-il</i> or <i>Elokim</i> (G-d). But we do find [elsewhere in Scripture] verses as follows: <i>and thou shalt offer burnt-offerings thereon unto the Eternal ‘Elokecha’</i> (<i>thy G-d</i>);<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">126</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 27:6.</i> <i>the bread of ‘Elokeihem’</i> (<i>their G-d</i>), <i>they do offer;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">127</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 21:6.</i> <i>thou shalt sanctify him</i> [the priest], <i>for he offereth the bread of ‘Elokecha’</i> (<i>thy G-d</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">128</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 8.</i> In the psalm mentioned above it is written, <i>Offer unto ‘Elokim’</i> (<i>G-d</i>) <i>the offering of thanksgiving</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">129</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 50:14.</i> It is further written: <i>For our fathers have acted treacherously, and done that which was evil in the sight of the Eternal our G-d, and have forsaken Him … Also they have closed the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt-offerings in the holy place unto ‘Elokei’</i> (<i>the G-d of</i>) <i>Israel</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">130</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Chronicles 29:6-7. Here too the Name <i>Elokei Yisrael</i> (the G-d of Israel) is used in connection with the burnt-offering, instead of the Proper Divine Name.</i><br>But the whole subject is explained in the Torah [itself], as it is said, <i>My offering, My bread ‘l’ishai’</i> (<i>for My fire-offerings</i>),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">131</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 28:2. — The word <i>l’ishai</i> [vowelled with a <i>patach</i>] means, “for My <i>ishim</i> — fires,” as alluded to further on.

But this is not so. Rather, the word <i>isheih</i> is a noun like <i>eish</i> (fire), and <i>olah isheih</i> [mentioned in Verse 9 before us] is like <i>olath eish</i> (a burnt-offering of fire), <i>of a pleasing odor unto the Eternal</i>, and so are all similar expressions, their meaning being like <i>lechem isheh</i> (the food of the fire-offering).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">135</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 3:11. In other words, although here in Verse 9 it is stated <i>isheih</i>, and so also in many other places, the word is yet to be understood as <i>isheh</i>, which is surely a noun and not an adjectival noun (as Ibn Ezra explained it).</i> The reason, however, why He did not say <i>eish</i> but said <i>isheih</i> [comprised of the letters: <i>alef, shin, hei</i>] is [to allude to] the plain meaning thereof, <i>as it hath been shown thee in the mount</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">136</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 27:8. — See here my Hebrew commentary, p. 13.</i> at the Giving of the Torah, which refers to the offering in the attribute of justice. The slaughtering [of the offering] must be to the Name of the Eternal alone, meaning that [he who slaughters it] must have no intention to do so to anything else in the world, save unto the Name of the Eternal only, this being the meaning of the expression ‘<i>olah hu … isheh hu</i>’ (it is <i>a burnt-offering … a fire-offering</i>)…<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">137</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 8:21. The word <i>olah</i> (burnt-offering) also means “ascending” — thus alluding to its ascension to the highest emanation.

If, however, we are to take into consideration their natural tendencies as far as eating them is concerned, it is possible that they were chosen for their special qualities; for turtledoves have a propensity to sharpening of the mind, and young pigeons have a propensity to benefit greatly those who are not fully-matured physically, such as youths in the intermediate stage between boyhood and maturity, and the like."

If so, why does it say <i>the priest … shall nip off?</i> It is to teach us that the nipping off be done [not with an instrument but] only by the priest himself.” “<i>And he shall nip off … and cause it to ascend in fumes … and the blood thereof shall be wrung out</i>. Is it possible to say that after he has burnt it, he should squeeze the blood out? But [the order of the wording] is to teach us that just as the burning of the head is to be done separately [as is indicated here in the verse, <i>and he shall nip off its head, and cause it to ascend in fumes</i>], and that of the body is to be done separately [as is stated further on in Verse 17: <i>and he shall cleave it … and cause it to ascend in fumes</i>], so also the nipping off has to be done in this way, the head separately and the body separately. The plain meaning of the verse, however, is that the wording is to be inverted: and he shall nip off and cause it to ascend in fumes, and before the burning its blood shall have been wrung out.” This is Rashi’s language.<br>Now it is impossible to say [that the order of the verse can be explained to mean] that he should nip off its head and burn it, and afterwards wring the blood of the body on the wall of the altar and then burn the body, since no limbs of any offering may ever be burnt [on the altar] before the sprinkling of the blood, the principle <i>for it is the blood that maketh atonement by reason of the life</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">173</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 17:11. Ramban’s intention is to defend Rashi’s explanation. At first sight, one could suggest an alternative explanation, which would leave the words of the verse in the correct order, namely that the nipping off and burning mentioned in the verse refer to the <i>head</i>, and the wringing of the blood can nonetheless be done <i>subsequently</i> because it refers to the body’s blood. Rashi, however, was compelled to invert the word-order because this suggested explanation is impossible, as explained by Ramban.</i> applying to all offerings. Therefore the Rabbis interpreted the verse [to mean] that Scripture intended only to liken the nipping off to the burning, so that in both cases the head should be treated by itself and the body by itself. The plain sense of the verse, however, is that “he should nip off its head in order to burn it on the altar,” thus teaching that the nipping off should be done in order to burn the head [separately, and not dispose of it otherwise], just as he will burn the body, concerning which He said, <i>and the priest shall cause it to ascend in fumes</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">174</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 17.</i> for such is Scriptures’ way of speaking about all offerings, as I have explained in connection with the severance into pieces of the burnt-offering.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">163</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 6.</i> However, Scripture states here, <i>and the priest shall cause it to ascend in fumes</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">174</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 17.</i> and did not say “and he shall cause <i>all</i> to ascend” [as it said above in Verse 9, in the case of the burnt-offering of the herd], because [here in the case of the burnt-offering of the fowl] the burning thereof was done in two separate stages: first he burnt the head, and then he removed the crop [from the body], and cleft it by the wings, and then he burnt the body, as we have been taught in Tractate Zebachim.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">172</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zebachim 65a.</i>"

But our Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">176</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zebachim 65b.</i> he cuts out with a knife an opening around the crop like a flap, and removes it together with the feathers [on the skin].” This is Rashi’s language.<br>But it is not correct.

Similarly: <i>for ‘natzoh’</i> (<i>she must fly away</i>) <i>and get away</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">177</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 48:9. Here too, the word <i>natzoh</i> is derived from the original root meaning “feathers” — hence: “she must fly away.”</i> The Jerusalem Targum rendered [the above-mentioned verse: <i>for ‘natzu’ and are wandered away</i>]:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">175</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lamentations 4:15.</i> “for they are ‘quarrelsome’ and have also wandered away.” The Targum thus derived the word <i>natzu</i> from the expression, <i>when men ‘yinatzu’</i> (<i>strive</i>) <i>together</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">178</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 25:11.</i> and the verse is thus stating that “they strive with all the nations and wander away from them, and do not continue to live among them.” This is a correct interpretation. But the word <i>notzah</i> in the sense of “loathsome” as the Rabbi [Rashi] has it, is not found. The interpretation of Aba Yosei which made it incumbent upon the priest to take also the stomach with the crop, is [not because he considers the word <i>b’notzathah</i> to mean “the place of its entrails,” as Rashi understood him, but rather] because the crop and the gullet together with the stomach, comprising the organs for the digestion of food [in the bird], are all included in the term <i>muratho</i>, because in the stomach the food turns into <i>r’ie</i> (dung). Aba Yosei thus does not differ at all with the First Sage who says that he should take it with the “feathers,” for we have been taught in a Mishnah of the sixth chapter of Tractate Zebachim<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">179</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zebachim 64b.</i> [with reference to the order of the burnt-offering of the bird]: “He [i.e. the priest] came then to the body, and removed the crop and the feathers and the entrails that came forth with the crop, and cast them on the place of ashes.” This Mishnah is in accordance with the teaching of Aba Yosei<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">180</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For according to the Sages he removes only the crop but not the entrails.</i> and yet it mentions “the feathers!”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">181</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This proves that Aba Yosei also interprets the word <i>b’notzathah</i> to mean with “its feathers,” and not, as Rashi explained it. that Aba Yosei interprets it to mean “the place of its digested food, namely the crop.”</i><br>Onkelos’ opinion [in translating <i>b’notzathah</i> as <i>b’uchleih</i>, is not because he considered this to be the Aramaic rendition of the word <i>b’notzathah</i>, so that you might think that he is of the opinion that the Hebrew word means “the place of its digested food,” as Rashi thought, but rather Onkelos’ opinion] is like that of the Sages, that he removed only the crop and its feathers together with the food therein which is the <i>mur’ah</i> [but he did not remove its entrails]. Since the priest takes hold of the crop and removes the food therein with it, therefore Onkelos rendered it: “and he shall remove <i>yath zfokeih b’uchleih</i>,” the expression being as if it had said: “and he shall remove <i>uchleih bizfokeih</i>,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">182</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban is thus saying that Onkelos in translating the Hebrew phrase <i>muratho b’notzathah</i> as <i>yath zfokeih b’uchleih</i>, did not put it in the order of the wording of the Hebrew; instead, it is as if he had inverted it and rendered it <i>yath uchleih bizfokeih</i>, as the Aramaic <i>uchleih</i> is the equivalent of the Hebrew <i>muratho</i>, and the Aramaic <i>bizfokeih</i> is the equivalent of the Hebrew <i>b’notzathah</i>, as explained in the text. The reason for this change is, as explained by Ramban, because the food (<i>muratho</i>) is only removable by means of taking away the crop (<i>zfokeih</i>). Ramban then brings a number of proofs to illustrate that it is Onkelos’ habit to change the order of the Hebrew wording when it appears better to him to do so.</i> for <i>uchleih</i> [according to Onkelos] is the Aramaic for the Hebrew <i>muratho</i> [as <i>muratho</i> is associated with the word <i>r’ie</i> — “dung,” and “food” turns into dung], whereas <i>zfokeih</i> is the translation for the Hebrew <i>b’notzathah</i> [as will be explained]. The verse [according to Onkelos] thus means as follows: he should remove the <i>mur’ah</i>, which is the food, with the plumage upon it, meaning that he takes the crop with its skin and the feathers upon it. In a similar way Onkelos translated [the Hebrew <i>‘ki sh’mi b’kirbo’ — for My Name is in him</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">183</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 23:21.</i>]: <i>arei bishmi meimreih</i> (“for in My Name is his word”),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">184</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., he speaks in My Name.</i> which, according to the Hebrew, he should have rendered into Aramaic as follows: <i>arei sh’mi b’meimreih</i> (for My Name is in his word). But Onkelos changed the order of the wording because of a certain reason known to him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">185</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ramban <i>ibid.</i>, Verse 20 (towards the end — Vol. II, p. 413) where he explains Onkelos’ intent in that translation.</i> So also he translated the verse: <i>And the two ends of the two wreathen chains</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">186</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 28:25.</i> — “and the two wreathen chains of the two ends.” There are many other such cases."

But it is not correct, for if so, then Scripture does not mention from which place he is to rend [the bird], whether from its front or back. Rather, the meaning thereof is as follows: “he shall rend it at the place of its wings,” for the letter <i>beth</i> [in the word <i>bichnafav</i>] serves here as “the <i>beth</i> of apparatus,” [teaching that the rending is to be done from the back of the bird where “the wings” are, for <i>knafav</i>, as will be explained, means “its wings,” and not “its feathers” as Rashi explained]; similar to the expression, <i>ba’aron</i>, (in the ark), <i>ba’bayith</i>, (in the house), or <i>ba’sadeh</i> (in the field). <i>Knafav</i> does not mean “feathers” [as Rashi wrote], but is similar to all expressions of <i>knafayim</i> mentioned in Scripture [which mean wings]: <i>every bird, whatever hath ‘kanaf’</i> (<i>wings</i>);<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">187</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 7:14.</i> <i>and he stretcheth ‘knafav’</i> (<i>his wings</i>) <i>towards the south</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">188</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 39:26.</i> Similarly, <i>‘bichnaf’</i> (<i>the skirt</i>) <i>of his robe</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">189</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 15:27.

However, bringing it near to the altar is not mentioned here, [but is stated further on in <i>Seder Tzav</i> 6:7] that all those things stated here before the taking of the handful — namely, pouring the oil and mingling it with the flour, and bringing it to the priest — are valid if done by a non-priest."

Perhaps he means that the priests when eating the flesh of certain offerings [such as the sin-offering, guilt-offering etc., or the Israelite eating the peace-offering] must salt it, otherwise the food is without flavor and thus they show their contempt for it, as they did not take the effort to prepare it properly. The commentators on Ibn Ezra are silent on this point.</i> because it is a mark of contempt.” Now since salt is the covenant of the offerings, Scripture made this accord the pattern for all such agreements, saying of the gifts given to priests and the dynasty of David that they are [an everlasting] <i>covenant of salt</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">222</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 18:19 [referring to the gifts of the priests]; II Chronicles 13:5 [referring to the kingdom of the House of David].</i> meaning that they are as everlasting as the covenant of salt of the offerings.

Now the nature of water is that it soaks into the earth and makes it bring forth and bud; but after it becomes salt it destroys every place and burns it, <i>that it is not sown, nor beareth</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">226</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 29:22.</i> Since a covenant is inclusive of all attributes, water and fire come into it, and <i>unto</i> her <i>shall come the former dominion</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">227</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Micah 4:8.</i> — the Kingdom of G-d, just like salt which seasons all foods and helps to preserve them, but destroys them when they are over-saturated with it. Thus salt is like the covenant.

                    "CHELBO’ (THE FAT THEREOF) ‘HA’ALYAH TH’MIMAH’ (THE FAT TAIL ENTIRE). The term <i>cheilev</i> (fat) in the Sacred Language indicates that part of the fat which is separate from the meat and not joined to it. <i>Shuman</i>, on the other hand, is that fat which is intertwined with the meat and cannot be separated from it, something like that which Scripture states: ‘<i>Vayishman Yeshurun</i>’ (<i>But Jeshurun waxed fat</i>);<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">253</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 32:15.</i> <i>so they did eat, and were filled ‘vayashminu’</i> (<i>and became fat</i>);<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">254</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nehemiah 9:25.</i> ‘<i>hashmein</i>’ (<i>make fat</i>) <i>the heart of this people;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">255</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 6:10.</i> <i>and my flesh is lean ‘mishamen’</i> (<i>and hath no fatness</i>);<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">256</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 109:24.</i> <i>and it shall be rich ‘v’shamein’</i> (<i>and fat</i>);<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">257</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 30:23.</i> <i>my soul is satisfied as with marrow ‘vadeshen’</i> (<i>and fatness</i>),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">258</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 63:6. It should be noted that this verse does not contain the root <i>shuman</i>, but <i>deshen</i>. We must assume then that Ramban considered them equivalent terms. This is strengthened by an examination of the Hebrew wording of the verse: ‘<i>k’mo cheilev vadeshen tisba nafshi</i>.’ Now <i>deshen</i> is thus in parallelism to <i>cheilev</i>; hence <i>deshen</i> must here be understood as <i>shuman</i>, as explained above.</i> and similarly in all places. But <i>cheilev</i> is the fat which is separate from the meat and covered by a membrane, and is easily peeled off. The Hebrew language never interchanges these terms [<i>cheilev</i> and <i>shuman</i>] in any place. Thus we say, <i>basar shamen</i> (fat meat), but not <i>basar cheilev</i> [since <i>cheilev</i>, as explained, is the fat which is separate and distinguished from the meat]. Similarly in languages of other nations these terms are separate. The term <i>cheilev</i> is sometimes used metaphorically, as is written, <i>when ye set apart ‘chelbo’</i> (<i>the best thereof</i>) <i>from it</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">259</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 18:30.</i> since the good part of the produce which is taken up [to be given to the priest], Scripture figuratively calls <i>cheilev</i>, just as the <i>cheilev</i> is set apart in the offerings. ‘<i>Cheilev kilyoth</i>’ (<i>the kidney-fat</i>) <i>of wheat</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">260</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 32:14.</i> — Scripture here compares wheat to the kidneys and the fat therein, just as it states, <i>and of the blood of the grape thou drankest foaming wine</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">260</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 32:14.</i> although wine is not blood [hence we must conclude that Scripture only uses these terms figuratively]. <i>And ye shall eat the ‘cheilev’</i> (<i>fat</i>) <i>of the land</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">261</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 45:18.</i> means that they shall eat the best of the bullocks, sheep, and goats and all animals. Such is the usage of this figure of speech.<br>Now the tail does not contain any <i>cheilev</i> at all,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">262</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Having established the premise that the term <i>cheilev</i> has a figurative meaning, Ramban now proceeds to his main theme here: that the tail of the animal contains no <i>cheilev</i> [which is the term for the fat which is forbidden to be eaten] at all, but rather it contains <i>shuman</i> [which is the fatty substance contained in the meat which cannot be separated from it, and is permitted to be eaten]. At the end of this lengthy discussion it will be made clear that Ramban’s intention is to refute a major contention of the Karaites, who prohibited the eating of the fat of the tail, while the true tradition of the Rabbis permits it to be eaten. See further, Note 277.</i> but rather has in it <i>shuman</i> (fat) which is not separate from the meat thereof, just as there is <i>in every good piece, the thigh and the shoulder</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">263</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 24:4.</i> This is confirmed by doctors who in their studies of nature have established the fact that <i>cheilev</i> [fat which is separate from the meat], is never to be found [in the animal] near the hide, nor in a limb which is always in movement [such as the tail]. The doctors have further said that the nature of <i>shuman</i> found in the ribs, sides and tail, which is not separate from the meat, is warm and moist, whilst that fat which can be separated from the meat, such as that which is upon the kidneys, is cold and moist, thick and coarse; it is difficult for the stomach to digest it fully, and it easily spoils; it also increases the white fluid<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">264</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The ancients believed that a person’s physical and mental constitution is determined by the proper balance of the four bodily fluids which exist in every man. These are “the four humors” — the red, the white, the green, and the black — which vary constantly in man and determine his state of health and disposition at any given moment. Since the eating of <i>cheilev</i> increases the white fluid beyond the proper proportion, it affects the health of the person adversely.</i> and constipates.<br>If so, the verse stating, <i>Eat ye not any ‘cheilev’</i> (<i>fat</i>) <i>nor blood</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">265</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 17.</i> does not include the <i>shuman</i> (fat) which is upon the tail, for that is not <i>cheilev</i> by name or nature. If all fat were to come under the term <i>cheilev</i>, then all fat in an animal — on the shoulders and sides — would not be allowed to be eaten! For Scripture does not say: “All fat which is offered unto G-d ye shall not eat” [so that you would include in this prohibition the fat of the tail, since it is offered as a fire-offering on the altar]. Rather, He states that “the <i>cheilev</i> (fat) of all cattle which are brought as offerings upon the altar, must not be eaten.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">266</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban’s intent is to refer to the following verse: <i>For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men present an offering unto the Eternal, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people</i> (further, 7:25). Now the verse does not state “For whosoever eateth the fat which men present as an offering …” [so that you could argue, since the tail and the fat thereon are offered upon the altar, therefore they may not be eaten]. Rather, the verse states, <i>For whosoever eateth the fat ‘of the beast’ of which men present an offering</i> …, thus teaching that the <i>cheilev</i> of any animal which <i>can be</i> brought as an offering — whether it is actually brought as a hallowed offering or is eaten as common food — is forbidden to be eaten. Thus the verse establishes that <i>cheilev</i> of the ox, sheep, and goat [from which offerings can be brought] is forbidden to be eaten, whether it be an offering or common food. See further, Note 277.</i> It is indeed impossible to say that He prohibited all these fats of the animal which are offered on the altar, for if so the kidneys and the lobe above the liver would be forbidden to be eaten [since they are offered on the altar]!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">267</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verses: 4 and 10, etc. And yet even the Karaites do not forbid these foods!</i> Rather, whatever fat comes under the term <i>cheilev</i> [as explained above], is forbidden to be eaten, even though it is not brought on the altar, such as the fat on the spleen; and that which is not called <i>cheilev</i> may be eaten even though it is offered on the altar, such as the [fat of the] kidneys and the lobe above the liver, and similarly also that of the tail [which even though it is brought on the altar, may be eaten because it is <i>shuman</i> and not <i>cheilev</i>]. Similarly, Scripture states in connection with the command of the installation of the priests, <i>And thou shalt take of the ram ‘ha’cheilev’</i> (<i>the fat</i>) <i>and the tail;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">268</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 29:22. This shows that the fat of the tail is not called <i>cheilev</i>.</i> and at the performance thereof it is written, <i>And he took the fat, and the tail</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">269</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 8:25.</i> for the tail is not <i>cheilev</i>. Now this verse [before us] which states ‘<i>chelbo ha’alyah th’mimah</i>’, means that he shall offer up [from the peace-offerings] the fat thereof, together with the entire fat tail, meaning that when he removes the “entire fat tail” until the rump-bone, he must take with it much fat that is attached to it on the inside. Thus the Rabbis have said in Torath Kohanim:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">270</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Vayikra</i> 19:2.</i> “This tells us that he must also take the fat near the tail, which is the fat between the sinews [in the loins].”<br>In my opinion the purport of this verse is also like that of the other verse: <i>And he shall offer of it all ‘chelbo’</i> (<i>the fat thereof</i>)<i>: ‘ha’alyah’</i> (<i>the fat tail</i>), <i>and the fat that covereth the inwards</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">271</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 7:3.</i> So here likewise He says, <i>And He shall offer of the sacrifice of peace-offerings</i> all the fat thereof. In these two verses [just quoted], He first makes a general statement, that [the priest] should offer all the fat thereof, and then He mentions in detail all the parts that he should offer [namely, <i>the fat tail entire … and the fat that covereth the inwards … and the two kidneys, and the fat upon them … and the lobe above the liver</i> …]. Now not everything that is mentioned here is <i>cheilev</i> [fat forbidden to be eaten], for the two kidneys [themselves] and the lobe above the liver are not at all included in the term <i>cheilev</i>. Thus He stated in the section of <i>Bayom Ha’shemini:</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">272</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“On the Eighth Day” of Initiation. It is the third section in this Book of Vayikra, known as <i>Shemini</i>.</i> <i>And ‘ha’cheilev’</i> (<i>the fat</i>), <i>and the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">273</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 9:10. The use of the separate terms there thus clearly proves that not everything mentioned is <i>cheilev;</i> hence we may also say that the <i>alyah</i> mentioned is not <i>cheilev</i>.</i> mentioning the <i>cheilev</i> by itself and then the other inwards by themselves, even as He said, <i>And thou shalt take of the ram ‘ha’cheilev’ and the tail</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">268</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 29:22. This shows that the fat of the tail is not called <i>cheilev</i>.</i> If so, the reason why the tail is offered [on the altar] is not because it is included here in Verse 9] in the term <i>chelbo</i>. Rather, He states here that the priest should burn [on the altar] from the peace-offerings all the fat thereof, and then He proceeds to explain all the inwards [which he should offer], some being <i>cheilev</i> and some not. The meaning of the verse in the case of the sin-offering stating, <i>And all the fat thereof he shall take away, as ‘cheilev’</i> (<i>the fat</i>) <i>is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace-offerings</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">274</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 4:31.</i> is not to refer only to that which is strictly speaking <i>cheilev</i>, for if that were so, the kidneys and the lobe on the liver [which are not <i>cheilev</i>] would not be offered up in the case of the sin-offering. Rather, the intention of the verse is that he is to take away the <i>cheilev</i> together with all the things that are removed from the peace-offerings. Similarly, [the verse stating in the case of the she-lamb brought as a sin-offering], <i>And all the fat thereof shall he take away, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace-offerings</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">275</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 35.</i> means that he is to take away as he had done in the case of the peace-offerings, meaning everything that he had taken away there, including the tail with its fat. Similarly, <i>And they put the ‘chalavim’</i> (<i>fats</i>) <i>upon the breasts, and he caused the fats to ascend in fumes</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">276</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 9:20.</i> means [the <i>cheilev</i>] together with all that is removed from them.<br>I have had to discuss this point at length in order to shut up the mouths of the Sadducees,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">277</sup><i class=\"footnote\">So also in Ibn Ezra here. The “Sadducees,” strictly speaking, were a sect during the Second Temple that denied the authority of the oral tradition. The name Sadducee, however, became a synonym for all those who denied Talmudic authority. The reference here is definitely to the Karaites — a sect which appeared in the Gaonic period (760 Common Era) which rejected the authority of the Oral Law, and based itself on individual interpretation of the Torah. A major contention of theirs (based upon the present verse) was that the tail is forbidden to be eaten since it is here called <i>cheilev</i>. See also Maimonides who writes: “the heretics who here in the Orient are called Karaites” (“The Commandments,” Vol. I, p. 160).</i> may their name be erased [from memory], for in matters of Torah it has been said, <i>Answer a fool according to his folly</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">278</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 26:5. Ramban’s allusion [in his words “for in matters of Torah it has been said, <i>Answer</i> … “] is to a point the Sages have made regarding an obvious contradiction in the Book of Proverbs. In Verse 4 there it states, <i>Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him</i>, and immediately in the following verse it states, <i>Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own eyes</i>. The Sages explained that there is no contradiction: “in matters of Torah answer him, but in other matters do not” (Shabbath 30b). It is to this principle that Ramban alludes in writing, “for in matters of Torah it has been said … ”</i> and the Rabbis have also said,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">279</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Aboth 2:14.</i> “Be diligent in learning Torah, in order to<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">280</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“In order to.” In our standards text of the Mishnah: “and know what to.”</i> be able to answer the unbeliever.”<br>The Gaon Rav Saadia<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">281</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See in Exodus, Vol. II, p. 99, Note 230.</i> explained it to them,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">282</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the Karaites. “Saadia persisted in fighting Karaism with literary weapons; and throughout his checkered life he continued to combat its apostles with unrelenting vigor, so that he became the most dreaded and most hated opponent of the [Karaite] sect down to our own times” (H. Malter, “Saadia Gaon,” p. 262).</i> by saying that <i>chelbo ha’alyah</i> is missing a connective <i>vav</i>, which would make it: <i>chelbo veha’alyah</i> — (its fat “and” the tail) [thus clearly meaning that the tail is not included in the <i>cheilev</i>]. But Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra refuted Rav Saadia Gaon by saying [that “from a grammatical point of view this could not be possible, for if so] it should have said <i>chelbo elyato</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">283</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, since <i>chelbo</i> comes with the pronominal suffix [meaning “its fat”], the word <i>ha’alyah</i> (the tail) should likewise have come in that form: <i>elyato</i> (“its tail”).</i> or <i>hacheilev ha’alyah</i>.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">284</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Or since <i>v’ha’alyah</i> (according to Saadia Gaon’s interpretation) comes without the pronominal suffix, the word <i>chelbo</i> should also not have it, making it — <i>hacheilev v’ha’alyah</i>. Thus Ibn Ezra is saying that the Karaite interpretation still stands, for since it is written <i>chelbo ha’alyah</i> it would appear that <i>ha’alyah</i> is in apposition to <i>chelbo</i>, thus explaining: “What is <i>chelbo? Ha’alyah</i>.” — Ramban, however, will refute this argument of Ibn Ezra, bringing proof from another verse in Scripture which mentions two nouns together, and yet one is written with a pronominal suffix and the other without. Thus Saadia Gaon’s refutation of the Karaite interpretation is valid, and the tradition that the tail is not <i>cheilev</i> is confirmed. See, however, further in text where Ramban comments on the Gaon’s interpretation.</i> But Ibn Ezra’s refutation is not valid, for we find [Scripture stating], <i>And all Israel and their elders, and officers, and their judges</i>!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">285</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 8:33. Here <i>u’zkeinav</i> (and their elders) comes with a pronominal suffix, and <i>v’shotrim</i> (and officers) does not. In our case too it is therefore correct to say, as Saadia Gaon does, that <i>chelbo ha’alyah</i> means <i>chelbo v’ha’alyah</i>, and the two nouns do not stand in apposition to each other, thus proving that the <i>alyah</i> is not <i>cheilev</i>.</i> I will yet mention<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">286</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 7:25.</i> a great mistake which Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra made in his arguments with them [i.e., the Karaites], in which he spoke more wrongly than they.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">287</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban’s intent is to Ibn Ezra’s statement there that <i>cheilev</i> of a cattle slaughtered as common food is not forbidden to be eaten (see above Note 266). That opinion is more harmful than what the Karaite have said. For in abstaining from eating the fat of the tail no infringement of the Torah is incurred, whilst in eating of the <i>cheilev</i> of cattle slaughtered as common food, one violates a prohibition of the Torah!</i> However, the Gaon’s interpretation is not correct,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">288</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, Ibn Ezra’s argument against the Gaon’s interpretation is surely not valid, as explained above. Yet the Gaon’s interpretation is also not persuasive, since his explanation is dependent upon a missing connective <i>vav</i>, making the word <i>ha’alyah — v’ha’alyah</i> (“and” the tail). Such an interpretation is not sufficiently convincing to base thereon the permission to eat the tail.</i> and surely it is not an argument sufficiently persuasive to permit the eating [of the tail because of it]. But the interpretation which our Rabbis advanced<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">289</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chullin 117a.</i> on the verse, <i>Ye shall eat no fat, of ox, or sheep, or goat</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">290</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 7:23.</i> that He prohibited only [that kind of fat like] the fat of the ox which is common to all [i.e., the sheep and the goat, thus excepting the fat of the tail of the sheep, which is not found in the ox], that is a proper interpretation [from which we may clearly know that the tail is permitted to be eaten]! But in order not to give contestants an occasion to dispute [the tradition of the Rabbis], we have had to bring the [other] proofs and arguments which we have written."

Since the process of thinking is centered in the soul, and it is the soul which commits the error,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">298</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Up to this chapter the subjects dealt with have been the burnt-offering, the meal-offering, and the peace-offerings — all of which are voluntary and are not brought for the commission of sin. Here the subject is the sin-offering which is brought as an atonement for a certain sin committed in error. See above, Note 68.</i> Scripture mentions here <i>nefesh</i> (soul). The reason for the offerings for the erring soul is that all sins [even if committed unwittingly] produce a particular “stain” upon the soul and constitute a blemish thereon, and the soul is only worthy to be received by the countenance of its Creator when it is pure of all sin. Were it not so, then all the fools of the world would be deserving to come before Him. It is for this reason that the erring soul brings an offering, through which it becomes worthy of approaching <i>unto G-d who gave it</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">299</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ecclesiastes 12:7.</i> It is on account of this that Scripture mentions here <i>nefesh</i> (soul). Our Rabbis have interpreted:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">300</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Vayikra Nedabah</i> 1:1.</i> “‘<i>Nefesh</i>’ (A soul) — this [word is used to] include proselytes and slaves” [thus teaching us that they too are under the obligation of bringing this offering, since the term <i>nefesh</i> is inclusive of them as well].<br>Now in the case of the sin-offering of the anointed priest [first discussed here in Verses 3-12], He does not say “and [the priest] shall make atonement for him, and he shall be forgiven,” as He mentions in the case of other sinners — namely, the whole congregation,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">301</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 20.</i> the prince,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">302</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 26.</i> and the common man.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">303</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verses 31 and 35.</i> Perhaps the reason for this is that due to his great importance he cannot obtain atonement nor be forgiven completely until he prays and beseeches his G-d, <i>for he is the messenger of the Eternal of hosts</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">304</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Malachi 2:7.</i> and he must be of clean and pure hands [so that he can never be reproached with anything; hence in addition to the offering he must bring, he must also pray especially for forgiveness].<br>Scripture does not mention here, when speaking about the bulls which were to be entirely burnt,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">305</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These bulls were the sin-offering for the anointed priest (Verse 3), and that of the whole congregation of Israel (Verse 14). After their fats were burnt on the altar, these bulls were taken outside the camp and completely burnt (Verses 12 and 21). This was unlike the procedure done to the sin-offering of the prince and the common man, of which only the fats were burnt on the altar, whereas the meat was eaten by the priests (further, 6:17-23). Hence the name given to the first two categories of sin-offerings [“bulls to be entirely burnt”].</i> that the burning of those portions offered on the altar is “of a pleasing odor,” or that it is “a fire-offering unto the Eternal.” The reason for this is that since part of them is burnt outside [the camp of Israel], it is therefore not for “the fire unto the Eternal.” In the case of the goat of the prince [which he brings as his sin-offering],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">306</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 23.</i> He mentioned “atonement” [<i>and the priest shall make atonement for him</i>]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">307</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 26.</i> but did not state that it is “a fire-offering, of a pleasing odor unto the Eternal,” because the offering is a <i>sa’ir</i> (a goat).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">308</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is like the <i>sa’ir</i> brought in case of idol worship (Numbers 15:24) (Ma’or V’shamesh).

                    "WHEN THE SIN WHEREIN THEY HAVE SINNED IS KNOWN [THEN THE ASSEMBLY SHALL OFFER A YOUNG BULLOCK …]. It is self-understood that they cannot offer a sin-offering until they know that they have sinned. [So why does Scripture mention it?] But it is a linguistic expression of the [Hebrew] language to say, “and when it becomes known to them that they have sinned, they should bring their offering.” Therefore He did not mention it [in Verse 3] in the case of the anointed priest, because there was no need for it. It is possible that [the reason why the verse says, <i>when their sin wherein they have sinned is known</i>, is not merely as a linguistic expression but to indicate] that the assembly is not obliged to bring this sin-offering unless they have definite knowledge of their sin but not if it is merely a doubt, as in the case of the suspensive guilt-offering.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">310</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>asham talui</i> (suspensive guilt-offering) is brought in case of doubt about one of those major sins for which the penalty if committed wilfully is excision, and a sin-offering if committed unintentionally. This offering is called a suspensive guilt-offering. An example of a case of a doubt which calls for such an offering is the following. Suppose a person has before him two pieces of fat, one of which is Scripturally-forbidden food, and the other is permitted to be eaten, and he eats one of the two [whilst the other is eaten by another person or lost]. A doubt then arises in his mind as to whether the piece he has eaten was the permitted or the forbidden food. In such a case he must bring an offering so as to effect atonement, and this is called a suspensive guilt-offering. If it is later established that he ate the forbidden fat, he must then bring a sin-offering (See Maimonides, “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 79-80). The point Ramban makes thus is that the verse before us teaches that the sin-offering of the assembly can be brought only when it is definitely confirmed that it has sinned [unintentionally], unlike the suspensive guilt-offering of the individual which is brought in case of doubt.</i> Our Rabbis have interpreted,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">311</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Vayikra Chobah</i> 4:12; Horayoth 5a.</i> [that the verse says, <i>the sin … is known</i>, to teach that] “if the court knew that they had given an [incorrect] decision [on one of two kinds of forbidden food, such as fat and blood, declaring that one of them may be eaten], but did not know which one it was that they permitted, [and the people had eaten both], I might think that the court is obligated to bring a sin-offering [as they usually are when they give an incorrect decision which the people followed]. Scripture therefore says, <i>when ‘the’ sin wherein they have sinned is known</i> — not when only the sinners are known.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">312</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In that case “the sinners” are known [i.e., it is known that the majority of the people relied on the mistaken decision and ate one of the forbidden foods, under which circumstances the court usually must bring a sin-offering for their mistaken ruling]. The particular “sin,” however, is not known, since the court does not know which of the forbidden foods it was that they incorrectly ruled to be permitted. In such a case, this verse teaches us that they do not bring a sin-offering.

There are many verses where the word <i>o</i> (or) is used in the sense of <i>im</i> (if), and conversely where <i>im</i> is used in the sense of <i>o</i>. Similarly, <i>‘o’ it be known that the ox was wont to gore</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">316</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 21:36.</i> [means ‘if’ it be known, and the word <i>o</i> which ordinarily means ‘or’ is here used in the sense of ‘<i>im</i>,’ meaning ‘if’].” Thus the language of Rashi.<br>Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented: “The sense of <i>asher nasi yechta</i> is as if the expression were inverted, making it read: <i>asher yechta nasi</i> (if ‘he who sins is the prince’), and it is connected with [the section] above, <i>And if the whole congregation of Israel shall err</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">317</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 13.</i> It is thus as if He had stated here: ‘and if he who sins is the prince [and he knows it of himself], or his sin be made known to him by others.’ Scripture, however, adopts a short form of expression, [omitting to state ‘that he knows the sin himself,’ or that it was made known to him ‘through others’], but the meaning is that either it becomes known to the prince by himself that he sinned, ‘<i>o hoda eilav</i>’ (<i>or it be made known to him</i>) — i.e., that another man who saw him doing it informed him of it. The grammatical form of <i>hoda</i> is then a past causative [like <i>hodi’a</i> — a man ‘informed’ him], this being similar to ‘<i>v’heitzar lecha</i>’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">318</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 28:25.</i> [the meaning of which is as if it said ‘<i>v’heitzir lecha</i>’ in the causative, i.e., <i>and he will besiege thee</i>]. The subject, however, is missing [for it should have said here, or ‘another man’ inform him, and there it should have stated, and ‘the enemy’ will besiege thee], just as ‘<i>asher’ bore her to Levi</i>”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">319</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 26:59.</i> [which should have read ‘<i>asher ishto</i>’ (<i>whose wife</i>) <i>bore her to Levi</i>]. [All these are the words of Ibn Ezra.].<br>But there is no need for all this, since the uses of the word <i>asher</i> are many. In some cases it indicates time, such as: ‘<i>ka’asher</i>’ (<i>when</i>) <i>Joseph came unto his brethren;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">320</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 37:23.</i> ‘<i>ka’asher</i>’ (<i>when</i>) <i>they had eaten up the corn</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">321</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 43:2.</i> and the like. Similarly, here too [<i>asher</i> is like <i>ka’asher</i> and indicates time]: ‘<i>when’ a prince sinneth</i>, with the <i>kaf</i> of cognizance [which would make it <i>ka’asher</i> — “when”] missing. So also, <i>The blessing, ‘asher’ ye shall hearken unto the commandments of the Eternal</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">322</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 11:27.</i> means ‘<i>ka’asher</i>’ (<i>when</i>) <i>ye shall hearken. ‘Asher’ ye have seen the Egyptians today, ye shall see them again no more</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">323</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 14:13.</i> means ‘<i>ka’asher</i>’ (<i>when</i>) <i>ye have seen them</i> [today ye shall see them no more]. <i>Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread ‘asher’ I commanded thee</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">324</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 34:18.</i> means ‘<i>ka’asher</i>’ (<i>when</i>) <i>I commanded thee</i>. At times this word [<i>asher</i>] is missing [not a <i>kaf</i> but] a <i>beth</i>. Thus: <i>And also Maacah his mother he</i> [King Asa of Judah] <i>removed from being queen, ‘asher’ she made an abominable image for an Asherah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">325</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Kings 15:13.</i> means <i>‘ba’asher’ she made an abominable image for an Asherah</i>, which denotes “because,” just like, ‘<i>ba’asher’</i> (<i>because</i>) <i>thou art his wife</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">326</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 39:9.</i> The expression <i>o hoda eilav</i> [is thus not a causative, as Ibn Ezra would have it, which would make it to mean “or that it was made known to him by another person;” rather, it] refers to the guilt, stating that when a person will <i>do any one of all the things which the Eternal his G-d hath commanded not to be done, and is guilty</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">327</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 22 here.</i> and deserving of punishment, or it be known to him and he will achieve atonement by means of an offering. The sense of the verse is thus: “he will either be guilty [and deserving of punishment], or bring an offering and he will be forgiven.” The reason for the expression: <i>the Eternal his G-d</i>, is to state that even though he is the king, and the lord upon whom there is no fear of mortal man, he is yet to fear <i>the Eternal his G-d</i>, for it is He who is <i>the Lord of lords</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">328</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 10:17.</i> Similarly, <i>that he</i> (the king) <i>may learn to fear the Eternal his G-d</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">329</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 17:19.</i> means that the king is to take to heart [the knowledge] that there is a Supreme One above him, Who is his G-d and in Whose power is his life and kingdom."

Thus, if the person interested in the evidence called upon him by an oath, adjuring him that if he knows any evidence favorable to him he should testify before the court, and he swore that he knows of no testimony concerning him, when in fact he does know, in such a case, if he swore either unintentionally or wilfully, he must offer what is called an offering of higher or lower value. See “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 82-83. In the following verse another transgression for which this offering is required is mentioned. — Ramban now proceeds to explain the sense of the triple expression, <i>and he is a witness, or knows, or saw</i>.</i> These are not three separate matters, for it is impossible that one be a witness without seeing and knowing. Rather, Scripture is stating that if one <i>hear the voice of adjuration</i> that a party to a law-suit adjures him, concerning a matter in which he is a witness either by seeing or knowing of it, <i>if he does not tell it</i> he has committed an iniquity. Now the witness is not obligated to bring this offering unless he knows such a testimony that the party in suit who adjured him [to give witness] would have legally won his case because of it [and the witness nonetheless withheld his evidence]. It is for this reason that our Rabbis<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">333</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shebuoth 33b.</i> interpreted [on the basis of the verse before us] that there is testimony which is valid by seeing without knowing, and [testimony which is valid] by knowing without seeing.

If therefore they withhold their testimony, they are liable to bring the offering dealt with here.</i> [If Reuben says to Shimon:] “You have admitted to owing me a maneh,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">334</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A Hebrew unit of weight and value, equal to the sixtieth part of a talent.</i> in the presence of such-and-such persons,” [and Shimon replies]: “let them come and testify,” this is a case of knowing without seeing [and even though they did not see, they must testify what they know, and hence are liable if they withhold their evidence].<br>But in line with the plain meaning of Scripture, we need not [explain] the “seeing” here [to mean seeing] without knowing. Rather, the sense of the verse is as follows: <i>whether he hath seen</i>, meaning that he saw the loan or the sale completely [i.e., with knowledge], <i>or known</i>, i.e., that he heard [the defendants to the suit] admitting that transaction in the presence of witnesses, but he did not see it.<br>Now He does not state here: “and it is hidden from him,” [as He does in the following verse], because in this case [where the witness swears that he knows of no testimony for the party that adjures him to come and testify before the court], he is obligated to bring the offering [mentioned here in these verses] whether he swore [entirely] wilfully, or was in error on the oath whilst wilfully denying his knowledge of evidence.

The offering, however, is not the one of higher or lower value mentioned in this section — but a guilt-offering, as explained further on (in Verses 23-26). Ramban mentions the “oath of deposit” here only to liken it to the “oath of testimony” in the sense that the offerings in each case are brought even if committed wilfully. This is a novel point in the law of offerings, for all other offerings brought for commission of a sin effect atonement only in case the transgression has been committed in error; otherwise, <i>the offering of the wicked is an abomination</i> (Proverbs 21:27). Ramban thus suggests [in line with the plain meaning of Scripture] that since the offerings in these two cases — that of the “oath of testimony” and the “oath of deposit” — are required to be brought even when committed wilfully, therefore the Torah mentions in their cases the subject of confession. But in the case of all other sin-offerings, since they are brought only when the transgression was committed in error, there is no need for confession of sin. However, Ramban will immediately refute this position, for the Rabbis have clearly interpreted that all sin-offerings require confession of sin.</i> He mentioned, <i>then they shall confess their sin which they have done</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">344</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 5:7.</i> But in the case of the sin-offering brought for transgression in error, He did not mention confession.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">345</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“But [when bringing] the sin-offering for a sin committed in error he does not confess” (Tur in quoting the language of Ramban).</i> But in the opinion of our Rabbis<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">346</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifre <i>Zuta</i> 5:5.</i> the expression, <i>and he shall confess that wherein he hath sinned</i>, refers to everything mentioned in this section, including the defiling of the Sanctuary and the holy food, and an “oath of utterance,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">337</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the second type of case for which the offering of higher or lower value is required.

In this case the word ‘<i>ashamo</i>’ [literally, “guilt”] is not the name of the offering, but merely indicates “the offering — i.e., a sin-offering — brought because of guilt.”</i> mentioned above in the case of the offering of higher and lower value means, “and he shall bring his offering unto the Eternal,” for that offering was a sin-offering, as He said, <i>a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat, for a sin-offering</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">351</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 6. In this case the word ‘<i>ashamo</i>’ [literally, “guilt”] is not the name of the offering, but merely indicates “the offering — i.e., a sin-offering — brought because of guilt.”</i><br>Now it has not been explained why the name of one offering is “a sin-offering,” and that of the other, “a guilt-offering,” since they both come to effect atonement for sin! We cannot say that the reason is since the sin-offering is a female [unlike the guilt-offering which is male, and therefore the word <i>asham</i> which is masculine cannot be applied to the female sin-offering], for there are sin-offerings which are male — namely the goats [brought as sin-offerings in case of the public worshipping idols,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">352</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A male goat is brought as a sin-offering by the prince (above, 4:23), and by the public for worshipping idols (Numbers 15:24), as well as on the Day of Atonement (further, 16:5).

How could one person have a simultaneous liability to bring these two offerings?</i><br>It appears to me that the term <i>asham</i> denotes some serious deeds for which the person who did it deserves to be <i>shameim</i> (ruined) and destroyed because of it, similar to the expressions: ‘<i>ha’ashimeim</i>’ (<i>destroy them</i>), <i>O G-d;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">355</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 5:11.</i> the pastures of the wilderness waste away.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">356</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I have found no such verse. Possibly it is a paraphrase of the verses in Jeremiah 9:9-10, where the prophet bewails the emptiness of the destroyed <i>pastures of the wilderness</i>, and predicts that the cities of Judah will be <i>sh’mama</i> (wasted away). Thus both phrases occur in juxtaposition, and Ramban deduces therefrom the underlying idea of the root <i>shamam</i>. Perhaps it is a combination of Isaiah 24:6 [where the word <i>vaye’shmu</i> — “and they wasted away”] and Joel 1:19 [where <i>the pastures of the wilderness</i>] are mentioned.</i> So also: ‘<i>Te’sham Shomron</i>’ (<i>Samaria shall be laid waste</i>), <i>for she hath rebelled against her G-d</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">357</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hosea 14:1.</i> and <i>we are ‘asheimim</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">358</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 42:21. Thus in place of the usual translation “we are guilty” [concerning our brother] Ramban interprets it to mean “we are being punished” on account of our brother.</i> — means “we are being punished.” The word <i>chatath</i> (sin) denotes something which has turned aside off the way, this being of the expression, <i>every one could sling stones at a hair-breadth and not ‘yachti’</i> (<i>miss</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">359</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Judges 20:16.</i> Now the guilt-offering for robberies,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">360</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verses 21-25.</i> and the guilt-offering for carnally knowing a handmaid already promised in marriage<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">361</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 19:20-22.</i> would then be called <i>asham</i> [indicating a serious sin] because they have to be brought even for wilful commission of the sin.

See also Rashi on Verse 18 [speaking of the suspensive guilt-offering]: “<i>a ram … with thy valuation</i> — according to the value stated above” [in Verse 15, i.e., at least two shekels].</i> whilst if the sin is confirmed, he brings a sin-offering which could be worth only a <i>danka</i> [a small Persian coin — the sixth of a <i>denar</i>]. Scripture calls it <i>asham</i> in order to say that it must be worth two <i>s’laim</i> just like the graver guilt-offerings [i.e., like the guilt-offering brought for appropriating sanctified objects, and that brought for carnally knowing a handmaid already promised in marriage, which must be worth at least two <i>s’laim</i>], thus indicating to the sinner [since he is in doubt as to whether he has sinned], that if he treats it lightly and will not bring his [offering for] atonement, he will be destroyed by his sin. This is the sense of the verse, ‘<i>Asham hu, ashom asham lashem</i>’ (<i>It is a guilt-offering — he hath surely incurred guilt before the Eternal</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">369</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 19.</i> That is to say, although this offering is brought only on a doubtful sin, <i>it is a guilt-offering</i>, for he has surely incurred guilt before the Eternal Who knows all hidden things, and if indeed he did sin before Him, He will requite him. Similarly, that which He said above, <i>and he shall bring his guilt-offering</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">370</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 6. The question arose (see Ramban at beginning of this verse), why the Torah calls it <i>ashamo</i> (his guilt-offering) when it is really a sin-offering — Ramban now proposes to answer that “it is because etc.”</i> is because among those sins mentioned above are also those which require the bringing of an offering even when they are committed wilfully, such as for the “oath of testimony; ”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">332</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The section here discusses the offering of higher or lower value (see above, Note 15), the verse before us stating that this offering is required in the case of a false oath concerning testimony. Thus, if the person interested in the evidence called upon him by an oath, adjuring him that if he knows any evidence favorable to him he should testify before the court, and he swore that he knows of no testimony concerning him, when in fact he does know, in such a case, if he swore either unintentionally or wilfully, he must offer what is called an offering of higher or lower value. See “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 82-83. In the following verse another transgression for which this offering is required is mentioned. — Ramban now proceeds to explain the sense of the triple expression, <i>and he is a witness, or knows, or saw</i>.</i> therefore He mentions the term <i>asham</i> with reference to them although the offering is called a sin-offering.<br>Also by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], a female offering for a sin is called <i>chatath</i> (sin-offering), and the male offering is called <i>asham</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">371</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, the determining factor for the difference in the names between the <i>chatath</i> and the <i>asham</i> is whether the offering is male or female.

                    "TZAV’ (COMMAND) AARON. In the [preceding] section of <i>Vayikra</i>, Scripture stated, <i>Speak unto the children of Israel</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 1:2.</i> for there He gave the command about the bringing of the offerings, and it is upon the Israelites to bring them. But here He states, <i>Command Aaron and his sons</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus the question arises: Why are these two sections addressed differently?</i> for He now speaks of the rites of the offerings and these are performed by the priests.<br>Now Rashi wrote: “<i>Command Aaron</i>. The expression ‘command …’ always implies urging [to fulfill the command] at once, and also for future generations. Rabbi Shimon said: Scripture found it especially necessary to urge, in cases where fulfillment of a command involves monetary loss.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since Rashi understood Rabbi Shimon’s statement as referring to the burnt-offering, it must be understood as follows: In the case of all other offerings, the priest eats part of the meat and thus derives some personal benefit, therefore he does not have to be urged on to perform their rites. In the case of the burnt-offering, however, he derives no benefit, since it is completely burnt on the altar; hence Scripture [speaking here of <i>the law of the burnt-offering</i>], preceded it by the expression, <i>‘command’ Aaron and his sons, saying: This is the law of the burnt-offering</i>, in order to urge them on to fulfill the commandment. — Ramban, however, argues that even from the burnt-offering the priests do derive a personal benefit, namely, the hide (further, 7:8). Accordingly he will interpret Rabbi Shimon’s statement as referring to another matter, as he explains further on.</i> But the explanation of Rabbi Shimon was not [said] with reference to this command, for here there is no monetary loss involved to the priests to whom this command was given. Indeed, they gain profit and reward from all the offerings,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The meat of the sin-offering and the guilt-offering is eaten completely by the priests. They are also given a share of the peace-offering (further, 7:34). The residue of the meal-offering after the handful was burnt on the altar, was eaten by the priests (<i>ibid.</i>, Verse 9).</i> even the burnt-offering.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a reference to the hide of the animal which belongs to the priest (further, 7:8). — Rashi, however, considered this share of little value and hence he understood Rabbi Shimon’s statement as applying to the burnt-offering, and that this was why the expression “command …” is mentioned here, namely, because the priests incur a monetary loss, and hence they had to be urged on to fulfill the command. — Thus according to Rashi, Rabbi Shimon differs with the First Sage, (<i>Tanna Kamma</i>) [when a Mishnah or a Beraitha cites a number of different authorities, and the first authority is mentioned annonymously, that opinion generally is referred to that of the <i>Tanna Kamma</i>] who said that the expression “command …” is mentioned here because it is a commandment binding at once and also for future generations, while Rabbi Shimon holds that this is not the reason for its use; instead, the reason for the expression “command …” is because in attending to the burnt-offering the priests suffer a monetary loss, and hence they have to be urged on. Ramban, however, argues that even in the case of burnt-offerings the priests incur no monetary loss, since they keep the hides, hence Rabbi Shimon also agrees with the First Sage that the reason for the use of the expression “command …” in this context is because it is a command binding at once and for future generations. Ramban then continues by saying that Rabbi Shimon’s statement has no bearing on our subject of the burnt-offering, but its meaning is as will be explained further on.</i> Rather, the intention of the First Sage [whom Rashi quoted] in saying, “the expression ‘command …’ always implies urging [to fulfill the command] at once and also for future generations,” was to say that in those sections of the Torah where Scripture wanted to urge fulfillment, saying that they should be fulfilled immediately and that they apply throughout the generations, it uses this expression of “command …” But in other sections it will say, “speak” to the children of Israel, or “say” unto them. With this [generalization] Rabbi Shimon differed, saying that sometimes<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., in other places. But here [in the case of the burnt-offering] Rabbi Shimon agrees with the reason stated by the First Sage. See Note 5 above.</i> this expression [“command … “] occurs in a matter which is not to be fulfilled immediately and throughout the generations, but it is used because the command involves a monetary loss. Such [a use of the word] “command” is that found in the case of the oil of the lighting<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 24:2: <i>Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure olive oil beaten for the light</i> …</i> [where, according to Rabbi Shimon, the expression “command …” is used because it applies immediately and for all generations, as well as for the reason that it involves a monetary loss], and that which Scripture states, <i>Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 35:2.</i> [which is a case where the use of the expression “command” can only be because monetary loss is involved, since it did not apply at once, but only after they had taken possession of the Land].<br>It is possible that we say that our command does involve a monetary loss to the priests, as a result of that which it says further on [in this section], <i>This is the offering of Aaron and his sons</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 13. This is interpreted by the Sages to mean that the High Priest is to bring a meal-offering every day, half of it in the morning and half thereof in the evening. The ordinary priest brought such a meal-offering at his installation into the priestly office, and it was known as the “meal-offering of initiation.” Since the money for these meal-offerings does not come from the public treasury but from the priests themselves, there is thus a monetary loss incurred by them, and hence the expression “Command Aaron and his sons …” with which this section opens. If this is so, Rabbi Shimon’s statement does refer to this section and Rashi was therefore correct in citing his words here — as being <i>an additional reason</i> to that of the First Sage as to why the expression “command …” is mentioned here. However, etc. (see text).</i> which is a continuation of this command. However, at the beginning of the Sifre,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Sifre.” This is the version found in all texts of Ramban — but it should be “Sifra,” as it is found here in Torath Kohanim at the beginning of the <i>Seder</i>. See in <i>Seder Vayikra</i> Note 121.</i> the opinions [of the First Sage and that of Rabbi Shimon] are taught in a manner indicating that they hold opposing views.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban’s intent is as follows: When in a Tannaitic text the opinion of a second Sage is mentioned in the words: “Rabbi … says,” it indicates that he differs with the opinion of the First Sage. Where, however, it states: “Said Rabbi …” it usually means that he agrees with the former opinion, but he makes an additional point to strengthen it further. Here, however, [in the text of the Sifra before Ramban] it states: “Rabbi Shimon says,” and hence indicates that he <i>differs</i> with the opinion of the First Sage. [It must be noted though that the Sifra text that <i>we</i> have has: “Said Rabbi Shimon,” which vindicates that there is no difference of opinion between the two Sages. Ramban’s Sifra text perforce must have had the reading: “Rabbi Shimon says …” A similar reading is found in the Sifre <i>Naso</i> 1: “Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai says … “]</i>",
                    "THIS IS ‘TORATH’ (THE LAW OF) THE BURNT-OFFERING. “This text is intended to teach us that the burning of the fats and limbs of offerings is valid [if performed anytime] during the whole night [following the day on which they were slaughtered]. It is also intended to teach us which of the disqualified offerings, although already brought up on to the altar, must be taken down, and which of them if already brought up need not be taken down. For all expressions of <i>torath</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In our Rashi text: <i>torah</i>.</i> [introducing a group of laws] denote inclusion — one law for all offerings that are brought up on to the altar, including some disqualified ones, namely that if they are already brought up on to the altar, they need not be taken down.” This is Rashi’s language.<br>But this law does not [in fact] apply to <i>everything</i> that has already been brought up on to the altar, but only to all offerings proper, for if drink-offerings<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Numbers 15:3-12 for the command that burnt-offerings and the peace-offerings had to be accompanied by an offering of wine.</i> are brought on to the altar [when they are not supposed to be] they must be taken down; and even if the libations are correctly offered up and the offering is disqualified, or the offering is correctly offered up and the libations disqualified, and definitely where both are disqualified — in all these cases, the offering itself is not to be taken down again, and the libations are to be taken down! For such is the sense of the inclusive term <i>torath ha’olah</i> (<i>the law of the burnt-offering</i>), teaching, “one law for all that goeth up [as the due of the altar-fires]” but not for the drink-offerings [since they are not poured on the fires, but into a silver bowl placed at the south-west corner of the altar],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Succah 48a.

And the explanation of the expression ‘<i>hi ha’olah</i>’ is as if it said: ‘<i>tiheyeh’ ha’olah</i> (the burnt-offering “shall be”) <i>on the firewood upon the altar all night</i>. He uses the word <i>hi</i> [literally: “she”] in order to exclude<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For just as the term <i>torah</i> (law) denotes inclusion (one law for all things), so does the word <i>hi</i> (“she” or “it”) denote exclusion, implying that the law under consideration does not apply to everything but is limited in its scope. It is the Sages who in their interpretation of the law determine in which cases it applies and in which it does not.</i> those things which the Rabbis have specified in the interpretation thereof. Now according to the [Rabbinical] interpretation this verse does not teach us that we are to bring up the limbs [of the offerings] from the ground to the altar at night, for this [principle] they have already derived from another verse, <i>Neither shall the fat of My feast remain all night until the morning</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 23:18.</i> [which the Sages interpreted<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mechilta <i>ibid</i>. See also Ramban there.</i> to mean, “<i>Neither shall the fat of My feast remain</i> on the stone pavement of the Court below, <i>all night until the morning</i>, but you should bring it up to the altar”]. For it is from that verse that the Rabbis have derived the law that [fats and limbs of the offerings] become disqualified [for the altar] if they remained upon the pavement [until the morning], but they may be brought up to the altar at any time during the night. Here Scripture speaks of those limbs which had already been brought up during daytime, [to teach] that the priest turns them over on the altar during the whole night until the morning. It is for this reason that He says <i>hi ha’olah</i> [using the definite article], meaning: “the one which has already come up” on the altar. It also teaches us that even those that are invalid, are not to be brought down again, [once they were taken up onto the altar], provided they became invalid in the Court of the Sanctuary [such as where they had remained overnight or had been unclean, etc.; but if they became invalid before reaching the Sanctuary Court, such as an animal that had been set apart for idolatry, or had been worshipped etc., these must be brought down].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Zebachim 84a for full discussion of these cases.</i> It also teaches that [invalid] drink-offerings<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Numbers 15:3-12 for the command that burnt-offerings and the peace-offerings had to be accompanied by an offering of wine.</i> must come down [since they do not go upon the fires on the altar],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Succah 48a.

                    "AND THE FIRE OF THE ALTAR SHALL BE BLAZING IN IT. Scripture is stating that it should burn on the altar during the whole night, it being a positive commandment that the priests should put on at daytime a lot of wood in order that it should not be burnt up completely and the fire [should not] become extinguished from it [during the night]. In my opinion, that which He said, <i>Fire shall be kept burning upon the altar continually; it shall not go out</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 6.

Ramban thus explains the impersonal language [“shall be kept burning”] as a command addressed to the priests.</i> meaning that it should never be allowed to become extinguished. Thus if the priests were careless and the fire became extinguished they would transgress this negative commandment.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See further, Note 25 where Ramban differs with Rashi in interpreting the expression ‘<i>lo thichbeh</i>’ (<i>it shall not go out</i>) which appears both in Verse 5 and Verse 6. Consequently Ramban writes here “in my opinion,” alluding to the fact that this is not in consonance with Rashi’s interpretation.</i> It is for this reason that our Rabbis have said<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yoma 22 b.</i> that [in addition to the large wood-stack burning on the altar] there was a second wood-stack solely for the purpose of keeping up the fire. And that which Scripture states, <i>And the fire upon the altar shall be blazing in it; it shall not go out</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 5.</i> is a redundant verse, and is therefore interpreted by our Rabbis<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Tzav</i> 2:7.</i> as having reference to all people, teaching that whoever extinguishes the fire, transgresses a negative commandment. Even if he extinguishes only one of the live coals of the wood-stack, he is liable to whipping, whether he put it out on top of the altar, or whether he extinguished it below [on the pavement of the Court] after he had taken it down. It appears to me that he violates only one negative commandment.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban’s intent is to allude to Rashi who wrote [in Verse 6]: “One who extinguishes the fire on the altar transgresses <i>two</i> negative commandments” [i.e., ‘<i>lo thichbeh</i>’ (<i>it shall not go out</i>) mentioned in Verse 5 and again in Verse 6]. According to Ramban, however, as explained above, the second <i>lo thichbeh</i> is a special prohibition to the priests who look after the altar not to be careless in permitting the fire to be extinguished. Hence there is only one verse [5] referring to <i>any</i> person who extinguishes the fire on the altar. Hence Ramban’s expression, “It appears to me that he violates only one negative commandment.”</i>"

However, He mentioned only these two garments because of new points that are added here to them, namely, that the tunic must be made to the priest’s measure. This means to say that if it was raised [above his feet], being so short that it did not reach his feet, and he performed therein one of the acts of offering, his Service is invalid. It further teaches that there must be nothing intervening between the breeches and his flesh. But the law requires equally that the priest who removes the ashes from the altar should wear all [four] priestly garments, for since Scripture mentioned that the removing of the ashes must be done with priestly garments, we know [automatically] that it requires four for the common priest and eight for the High Priest.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The ordinary priest ministered in four garments: the tunic, breeches, turban, and the belt.

It is to include the turban and the belt” [which the priest is also to put on for the removing of the ashes].<br>Now Onkelos translated the word <i>mido</i> as <i>levushin</i> [“garments” — as opposed to Rashi’s interpretation, according to which it refers only to one garment, the tunic]. It would appear then that according to Onkelos, the word <i>mido</i> is a term which includes all of the priest’s garments, as if the verse were stating, “and the priest shall put on linen garments.” Similarly we are to understand the expressions: ‘<i>madav</i>’ (<i>his clothes</i>) <i>rent;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 4:12.</i> <i>that cometh down upon the collar ‘midothav’</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 133:2.</i> which means upon the edge of his garments; <i>girded with ‘mido’</i> (<i>his apparel</i>) <i>of war</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Samuel 20:8.</i> which means his garments.

This is expressly stated in the Torah. The question appears as to how the belt for the common priests was made. Rabbi Dosa is of the opinion that it was made only of linen; Rabbi Yehudah Hanasi differs, holding that it was like that of the High Priest. Now since Onkelos, as explained by Ramban, explains the word <i>mido</i> as an inclusive term for “all” the priest’s garments, and the verse states, <i>and the priest shall put on ‘mido’</i> (<i>his ‘garments’ of</i>) <i>linen</i>, Onkelos accordingly must agree with Rabbi Dosa that the belt of the common priest was unlike that of the High Priest, as the belt of the common priest was only of linen. Hence it states that the common priest shall put on <i>all</i> his garments of linen which includes the belt.</i>"

                    "AND HE SHALL PUT OFF HIS GARMENTS, [AND PUT ON OTHER GARMENTS, AND CARRY FORTH THE ASHES WITHOUT THE CAMP UNTO A CLEAN PLACE].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The subject-matter of this verse [4] should be clearly distinguished from that of the preceding verse. In Verse 3 the Torah commanded the priests to remove the ashes daily from the altar. This involved the priest’s taking a silver pan and going up to the top of the altar, and afterwards “he cleared away the cinders on either side and he scooped up the ashes in the center. He then descended, and when he reached the pavement he turned his face to the north and went along the east side of the ascent for about ten cubits, and then made a heap of the cinders on the pavement three handbreadths away from the ascent” (Tamid 28 b). This process of course did not remove <i>all</i> the ashes from upon the altar. This was done from time to time when there was a need for it, when so much accumulated that there was no more room on the woodpile. Then it was removed to a place outside the camp or Jerusalem. It is this latter subject which is the theme of the present verse.</i> “This was not compulsory for him to do so, but it would be a matter of propriety, so that he should not soil the garments in which he regularly ministers at the altar, by the removal of the ashes to a place without the camp. Garments worn when boiling the pot for one’s master, one should not wear when pouring out a glass of wine for him. That is why He said, <i>and he shall put on other garments</i> — of [a quality] inferior [to those in which he ministers at the altar].” This is Rashi’s language. Now the intent of our Rabbis in this remark was to state that the taking of the ashes [to a place outside the camp] must be done with the priests wearing the priestly garments, and thus the <i>other garments</i> [mentioned in the verse] are not ordinary clothes. Thus I do not know the source for that which the Rabbi [Rashi] said, that “it was not compulsory” [that he remove the garments in which he performs the regular Divine Service, and put on other garments when taking out the ashes to a place outside the camp]. For it would appear that it is a positive commandment to the priest, that the garments in which he performs the acts of offering, including the [daily] lifting up of the ashes, be clean ones, and that he must not perform the regular Divine Service with those garments in which he takes the ashes [outside the camp]. This commandment [of the changing of the garments] is of the nature of a servant’s etiquette towards his master. Therefore the priests should have more expensive garments for performing the acts of offering, and ones of inferior quality for removing the ashes [to a place outside the camp or city of Jerusalem].<br>All this is in accordance with this reasoning which the Rabbi [Rashi] wrote [i.e., that the removal of the ashes must be done in priestly garments]. But there are some of our Rabbis mentioned there in Tractate Yoma<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yoma 23 b. See my Hebrew commentary p. 29, that the Sage holding this opinion is Rabbi Eliezer.</i> who say that the taking out of the ashes did not have to be done in priestly garments. Thus the verse stating, <i>and he shall put on other garments</i> means “ordinary clothes,” and this is also the plain meaning of the verse, commanding the priest that he should not soil <i>the linen garments, which are the holy garments</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 16:32.</i> with the taking out of the ashes; instead he is to put on ordinary clothes."

This section, according to the plain meaning of Scripture, adds [to Chapter 2 above where the law of the meal-offering was discussed] four commandments about the meal-offering: that [the residue be] eaten unleavened, that it be eaten <i>in the Court of the Tent of Meeting</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 9.</i> that <i>every male among the children of Aaron may eat of it</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 11.</i> and that whatever touches it becomes holy.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“So that it becomes exactly like the meal-offering — that if it had become disqualified to be eaten, the food which touched it is also disqualified. And if the meal-offering was fit to be eaten, the other food must also be eaten under the same stringency as the meal-offering” (Rashi, Verse 11).</i><br>Now according to the Rabbinical interpretation thereof, there are many new teachings added [in this section, among them being the following]: that even of a meal-offering brought by priests the handful is taken out [and burnt on the altar, in the same way as the residue which must be burnt on the altar];<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If a meal-offering is brought by a non-priest, a handful of it is taken off by a priest and burnt on the altar, while the residue is eaten by the priests. Now the Torah specifies, however, that if the meal-offering is brought by a priest, it is to be <i>wholly</i> burnt (further, Verse 16). The question appears: is it necessary that a handful thereof be taken by a priest and be burnt separately on the altar, or that the whole meal-offering should be burnt at the same time as a unit? According to the text in Ramban before us, the answer is clearly in the affirmative. Scholars, however, have pointed to the Talmud (in Menachoth 72 b) where the conclusion is contrary to this text. The suggestion has therefore been made that the text here is faulty, and should be emended to read: “that even a meal-offering of priests requires ‘oil and frankincense’” (mentioned in Verse 8). See my Hebrew commentary, p. 29.</i> that the priest must bring it near <i>before the Eternal</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Verse 7 before us.</i> which means to the western corner [of the altar, since the Tent of Meeting where the ark of the covenant stood, was to the west of the altar, and therefore nearest to it], and <i>in front of the altar</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Verse 7 before us.</i> which means to the southern corner [since the ramp of the altar which is its “front,” was on the south side thereof]. Thus you find that it had to be “presented” [i.e., brought near] to the southwestern corner of the altar. [And this section further teaches:] <i>And he shall take up from it</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 8.</i> a handful — “from it” as one joined mass, meaning that he is not to bring one tenth of an ephah of flour [which is the amount brought for a meal-offering] in two receptacles [but it must be a full tenth of an ephah in one receptacle], nor is he to make a fixed measure that holds as much as his handful [to remove the amount of flour for the altar, but he must do it with his hand]. He also states, <i>It shall not be baked as anything leavened</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 10.</i> This is to liken all the stages of work [in the preparation of the meal-offering] to baking, thus teaching that one is also liable for kneading and rolling it if it be leavened, and that for each and every such act he transgresses a negative commandment and is liable to whipping on each count."

Sacred money, on the other hand, is not completely his to dispose of as he wishes.</i> and can be offered only at daytime, and the priest performs all its acts with his right arm — so also this meal-offering must come from ordinary money, and be brought at daytime, and its acts must be performed with the priest’s right hand. <i>Every male among the children of Aaron may eat of it</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 11.</i> — it may be apportioned even amongst those priests who have a bodily blemish [such as are mentioned further in Chapter 21:16-21 as disqualifying them from performing the acts of offering, but they may eat the residue of the meal-offering].<br>Now with regards to the meal-offering of the priests He added [this command]: <i>And every meal-offering of the priest shall be wholly burnt; it shall not be eaten</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 16.</i> On this the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] wrote in the Moreh Nebuchim<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Guide of the Perplexed III, 46.</i> that the reason [for the meal-offering of the priest being entirely burnt] is because every priest offered up his own meal-offering himself, and if he were to offer it and eat the residue of it himself, it would appear as if he had brought no offering.

Hence the Torah prohibited him from eating it. In Ibn Tibbon’s translation, however, the reading is: “<i>V’lo yeira’eh</i> (and it will not appear),” that is, to others, that a Service has been performed, and therefore they will hold the priest in disregard for eating it.

In <i>Seder Vayikra</i> He commanded concerning [the offerings in the following order]: the burnt-offering, the meal-offering, the peace-offerings, the sin-offering and the guilt-offering, [the reason for this order being] that at first He spoke about the freewill offerings [namely the burnt-offering, the meal-offering and the peace-offerings], and afterwards He mentioned those offerings which are obligatory upon the sinner. Here, however, [in <i>Seder Tzav</i>] the explanation is given first in connection with the burnt-offering and meal-offering, and only then about the sin-offering and guilt-offering, because He wished to explain the laws of the most holy offerings [in one group], since there is one law for them all, as He said [above in Verse 10] with reference to the meal-offering, <i>it is most holy, as the sin-offering and the guilt-offering</i>, and only afterwards He explains the law of those offerings which are less holy [namely, the peace-offerings].<br>Now in this section [dealing with the sin-offering] He added many new laws.

These sin-offerings were wholly burnt outside the camp [and later, after the Sanctuary was built, they were burnt outside the city of Jerusalem]. — Now here in Verse 20 Scripture states the law regarding “the <i>outer</i> sin-offerings,” that if any of their blood was sprinkled upon a garment, the garment must be washed in a holy place [i.e., in the Court of the Sanctuary], But it does not say this law with regard to “the inner sin-offerings.” Since the section, however, begins with the expression [<i>zoth</i>] <i>‘torath’ hachatath</i> (<i>this is ‘the law’ of the sin-offering</i>), and the word <i>torath</i> denotes inclusion, we know that the same law applies to both kinds of sin-offering.</i> [if sprinkled upon a garment] must be washed off [<i>in a holy place</i>].

He also states here [in the verse before us], <i>in the place where the burnt-offering is slaughtered shall the sin-offering be slaughtered before the Eternal</i>, thus indicating that all sin-offerings must be slaughtered only on the northern side of the altar, since in the section of <i>Vayikra</i> this was stated only with reference to the sin-offering of the prince<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 4:24.</i> and of the individual;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 29, 33.</i> therefore here [in this section] they are all included — the sin-offerings of the public and “the inner sin-offerings.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sin-offerings were of two kinds: (a) those whose blood was sprinkled on the outer altar, and are therefore referred to as the “outer sin-offerings.” These included most of the sin-offerings.

These sin-offerings were wholly burnt outside the camp [and later, after the Sanctuary was built, they were burnt outside the city of Jerusalem]. — Now here in Verse 20 Scripture states the law regarding “the <i>outer</i> sin-offerings,” that if any of their blood was sprinkled upon a garment, the garment must be washed in a holy place [i.e., in the Court of the Sanctuary], But it does not say this law with regard to “the inner sin-offerings.” Since the section, however, begins with the expression [<i>zoth</i>] <i>‘torath’ hachatath</i> (<i>this is ‘the law’ of the sin-offering</i>), and the word <i>torath</i> denotes inclusion, we know that the same law applies to both kinds of sin-offering.</i> even though he has not [in fact] atoned with it, meaning that he has not sprinkled any of its blood, it is nonetheless invalidated from the moment of entry, and [the offering] is to be burnt. It is possible according to this that if he brought it in with the intent of not sprinkling thereof at all [in the Sanctuary], that the offering remains valid. According to the words of Rabbi Shimon,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zebachim 83 a.</i> it only becomes invalidated if he “atoned” with the blood, meaning that he actually sprinkled thereof in the same manner as is done in the case of “the inner sin-offerings” [i.e., in front of the Veil and on the comers of the golden altar].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">64</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See above, 4:6-7.</i> It is for this reason that Scripture states <i>to atone</i> — not [meaning] that he actually effected atonement, but that he brought of its blood to atone with it, and, according to his thinking, effected atonement. The meaning of the term “into the interior” [which Rashi mentioned above] is “into the Sanctuary.” The same [is also the meaning of the phrase] “if he brought into the ‘interior of the interior’ [i.e., the Holy of Holies]” of the bullock of the anointed priest,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 4-7.</i> or that of “forgetting a matter of law,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 13-18.</i> or of the goats brought for worshipping the idols,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">67</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 15:24.</i> namely that if he brought their blood into a more interior place than that designated for them, [since in these cases of sin-offering the blood is to be brought into the Sanctuary proper to effect atonement], then the offerings become invalidated. Scripture states <i>‘of’ the blood</i> in order to indicate that even bringing in part of the blood invalidates the offering. Thus if the priest received the blood in two cups, and brought only one of them into the interior, the offering is invalidated.<br>By way of the plain meaning of Scripture,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus far we have followed the interpretation of Rashi which is based upon sources in the Talmud, which was as follows: “<i>and every</i> outer <i>sin-offering whereof any of the blood is brought into the Tent of Meeting to atone in the holy place</i>, according to the priest’s intent which was not, however, in accordance with the law — since the blood of an outer sin-offering is to be sprinkled upon the outer altar — that offering <i>shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire</i>.” Ramban is now to suggest a totally different interpretation, namely, that the verse is not speaking of <i>outer</i> sin-offerings wrongly brought in, but establishes the principle that all “<i>inner</i> sin-offerings” [as enumerated in the text: “the bullock of the anointed priest etc.”] the blood of which <i>is</i> regularly brought into the interior, are not to be eaten by the priests, unlike that of “the outer sin-offerings,” whose meat is eaten by the priests (see Note 52 above). Ramban will conclude by saying that this is the interpretation of one of the Sages in the Torath Kohanim and Talmud.</i> the verse speaks only with reference to “the inner sin-offerings,” concerning the burning of which He had already commanded,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 4:12, 21.</i> and here Scripture came to add a negative commandment against eating them,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The command in Chapter 4 is a positive one; Ramban is saying that the verse here adds to this a negative command, not to eat of the flesh, in addition to the positive one to burn it. There is thus an additional penalty for one who eats of it.</i> for this section is intended to complete the laws of sin-offerings.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban means to say that although Verses 17-22 clearly speak of <i>outer</i> sin-offerings [which are eaten], Scripture wished to complete here all laws pertaining to all sin-offerings, and thus we may interpret Verse 23 as indeed referring to <i>inner</i> sin-offerings (see note 68 above).</i> This is the interpretation of Rabbi Yosei the Galilean in the Torath Kohanim<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">72</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Tzav</i> 8:5.</i> and in Tractate Zebachim.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">73</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zebachim 82 a.</i>"

This is the interpretation of Rabbi [Yehuda Hanasi] who says,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">77</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zebachim 103 b.</i> “Essentially we need this verse only for the skin of the burnt-offering [to teach that it belongs to the priest], since the skin always follows the meat”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">78</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“The bullocks which are burnt and the he-goats which are burnt [outside the camp], their skins are burnt with them, as it is said, <i>and they shall burn in fire their skins, and their flesh</i> (further, 16:27) (Torath Kohanim, <i>Tzav</i> 9:5).

The simple explanation of this verse is apparent, namely that He is commanding here that if one vows to bring one of the three kinds of meal-offering — the one baked in the oven, or made in the boiling pot, or in the pan — that they should all be given exclusively to the priest who offered them. Then He states concerning all the other meal-offerings, — such as if a person vowed to bring a meal-offering without specification of which kind, in which case he brings it of fine flour, and the meal-offering of first-fruits,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">79</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 2:14-16.</i> which are both mixed with oil; and the meal-offering of the sinner<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">80</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 5:11-14.</i> and of the suspected adulteress<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">81</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 5:15.</i> which are dry [without oil and without frankincense] — that they should be divided <i>among all the sons of Aaron</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">82</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 10.</i> that is to say, among all priests of their Father’s House.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">83</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The priests were divided into twenty-four groups. Each group came by turn to the Sanctuary for one week’s service. These groups were in turn subdivided into Fathers’ Houses, each House ministering for one day out of the seven. On the festivals all the groups shared equally in the Service. See “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 46-47.</i> The meaning of the expression, <i>and every meal-offering, mingled with oil, or dry</i> — is that a meal-offering which is of fine flour only, whether it be mixed with oil or dry, which is not one of these [three] mentioned above [the one baked in the oven, or made in the boiling pot, or in the pan — belongs to all priests who were ministering on that day, and not exclusively to the priests who offered them]. The reason for the difference between them is because [in the case of the three meal-offerings mentioned above] the priest took pains in baking them, and therefore he deserves to be given a greater reward. [All this is in accordance with the plain meaning of Scripture].<br>Our Rabbis, however, did not want to explain the verses in this way because Scripture said, <i>and every meal-offering, mingled with oil or dry</i>, which includes <i>all</i> possible meal-offerings, since they are all either mingled with oil or dry. Therefore the Rabbis understood the expression <i>it shall be the priest’s that offereth it</i> [mentioned here in Verse 9 in connection with the three meal-offerings: the one baked in the oven, etc.] as meaning that it shall belong to all pure priests who are present there. Similarly, when He said, <i>And the priest that offereth any man’s burnt-offering</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">84</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 8 — stating that the skin of the burnt-offering belongs to the priest who offered it.</i> and <i>the priest that maketh atonement therewith, he shall have it</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">85</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 7 — stating that the meat of the sin-offering and guilt-offering belong to the priest that made the atonement.</i> these verses are only intended to say that they do not belong to the owners who brought them, but that in reward for offering them they belong to the pure priests who are present there, for all of them are engaged in offering them, whether physically or by command, since any individual priest or two or three of them who offered up [the particular offering], did so with the permission of all of them and acting as their deputy, and all of them would stand by the offering. <i>As is the share of him that goeth down to the battle, so shall be the share of him that tarrieth by the baggage; they shall share alike</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">86</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 30:24.</i> After He had said [in general terms] that they shall belong to the priests as a reward for their service, He explained it again in detail: <i>and every meal-offering, mingled with oil, or dry</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">82</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 10.</i> which includes all meal-offerings, <i>shall all the sons of Aaron have</i>, meaning all the officiating priests mentioned [in the preceding verses], <i>one as well as another</i>, that is to say, all clean priests of the Father’s House,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">83</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The priests were divided into twenty-four groups. Each group came by turn to the Sanctuary for one week’s service. These groups were in turn subdivided into Fathers’ Houses, each House ministering for one day out of the seven. On the festivals all the groups shared equally in the Service. See “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 46-47.</i> as they are all the officiating priests mentioned previously. Thus Scripture [first] mentioned the meal-offerings by their individual names — the one baked in the oven, or made in the boiling pot, or in the pan — and then mentioned them all again in a general rule, saying [that they belong to all the priests], <i>one as well as another</i>, meaning that one priest should only have [of the kind of meal-offering] that the other priest has, [and they cannot give one priest his share of one kind of meal-offering, and the others a share of another kind]. Even if the meal-offering was of fine flour, each is to be given his share from that offering.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">87</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The point here is as follows. In the case of the three meal-offerings which are baked [i.e., the one baked in the oven, made in the boiling pot, and in the pan], even if the priest receives only a small part thereof, he can eat it readily. But in the case of the meal-offering of fine flour, if the share is small he will not be benefitted much by it. One might therefore think that he can receive his share from another kind of meal-offering, hence the law states that the apportionment must be only in that one kind.</i> Scripture thus states that this law applies to meal-offerings, and all the more so to the other offerings, which are of greater monetary value. It is tradition which decides [in favor of the Rabbis’ interpretation mentioned above],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">88</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, even though the literal interpretation of the verses indicates that the three baked meal-offerings should all belong exclusively to the priest who was actively engaged in offering them, yet it is tradition which is the deciding factor that the Rabbis’ analysis of the verses, as explained above, is correct.</i> and it is furthermore for the benefit of [all] the priests and conducive to peace in the Sanctuary.<br>It is possible that the interpretation of the verses according to this opinion of the Rabbis is as follows: “<i>And every meal-offering that is baked in the oven, and everything made in the boiling pot, and in the pan, shall be the priest’s that offereth it; and every meal-offering, mingled with oil, or dry</i> shall [also] be so, and <i>all the sons of Aaron shall have it, one as well as another</i>.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">89</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This interpretation indicates clearly that <i>all</i> meal-offerings are mentioned alike in Scripture with respect to the share of all ministering priests on that day.</i>"

The commentators<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">90</sup><i class=\"footnote\">So explained by Ibn Ezra.</i> have explained the word <i>al</i> as meaning “with” — <i>with the offering of thanksgiving</i>. Similarly, <i>‘al’ the cakes of leavened bread</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">91</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 13.</i> means “with them.” The correct interpretation appears to me that the word <i>al</i> is here to be understood in its ordinary sense [i.e., “upon”], meaning that he should add bread “upon” the offering. Similarly, <i>‘al’ the cakes of leavened bread he shall present his offering</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">91</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 13.</i> means that he is to bring cakes of leavened bread, and adding “upon” them he is to bring <i>his offering</i>, which is the unleavened bread mentioned [in Verse 12 before us] — all these breads [thirty unleavened cakes and ten leavened ones] he is to bring <i>upon the offering</i> [of thanksgiving]. Scripture thus made the leavened bread the chief part of the offering, “adding” upon it the rest of the bread [i.e., the unleavened bread, by stating “upon the cakes of leavened bread he shall present <i>his offering,”</i> which means “his unleavened bread”], because the unleavened breads are more than all the other kinds.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">92</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Flour comprising twenty tenths of an ephah (see Note 95) was divided equally for the baking of the unleavened and leavened breads. The unleavened breads were of three kinds [cakes, wafers, and cakes of flour saturated with oil — as mentioned in Verse 12] each consisting of ten, thus making thirty unleavened breads. The leavened breads were ten. Thus while fewer in number, the leavened breads were yet larger, since the same amount of flour was used for the total amount of unleavened breads — thirty — as for the ten leavened breads. Of these four kinds of breads, one of each was given to the priest and the rest were eaten by the owner of the offering and his family.</i> Scripture changed the expression, stating, [<i>he shall present his offering</i>] <i>of his peace-offerings for thanksgiving</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">91</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 13.</i> [while here in Verse 12 it merely says, <i>the offering of thanksgiving</i>], in order to allude to the Rabbis’ interpretation regarding it, namely that the bread does not become holy in itself [in the sense that it cannot be redeemed, or that it becomes invalid if carried outside the wall of the city, etc.] until the offering is slaughtered, and [also] that it should be slaughtered “upon” it [the bread], that is to say, with the intention that the bread should become holy with it [the offering].<br>Now Rashi wrote: “<i>Then he shall bring with the offering of thanksgiving</i> four sorts of bread: cakes, wafers, and cakes mingled with oil — these three kinds being of unleavened bread. And it further states, <i>with cakes of leavened bread</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">91</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 13.</i> [thus making four kinds], and each kind consisted of ten cakes.

Six seahs thus make two ephahs. Since in each ephah there are ten tenths [of the ephah], the two ephahs [comprising the six seahs] make twenty tenths of the ephah.</i> Now the Rabbi [Rashi] did not mention in connection with these twenty tenths [of flour] that ten of them were for the leavened cakes, a tenth for each one, and the other ten tenths for the unleavened ones, thus making three unleavened cakes to each tenth of flour.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There were three kinds of unleavened cake, each consisting of ten cakes, thus totaling thirty.

So the question recurs: Why did Scripture not call attention to the exception of the breads of the thanks-offering? The Tur answers that Scripture called attention only to an obligatory offering, such being the case of “the two loaves” on the Festival of Shevuoth, but not to a thanks-offering, which is a freewill offering.

But it is not correct, for the Festal-offering of the fourteenth day of Nisan may be eaten for two days and the one intervening night, like the rest of the peace-offerings. So also we have been taught in Tractate Pesachim:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">111</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Pesachim 71 b.</i> “<i>Neither shall any of the flesh, which thou offerest on the first day at even, remain all night until the morning</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">112</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 16:4.</i> Scripture speaks here of the Festal-offering of the fourteenth day of Nisan, teaching that it may be eaten for two days and the one intervening night,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">113</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The explanation of the verse (Rashi <i>ibid.</i>) is thus as follows: “<i>Neither shall any of the flesh which thou offerest at even</i> [i.e., towards eventide on the fourteenth of Nisan] <i>remain on the first day</i> [of the festival, i.e., the fifteenth day of Nisan] <i>all night until the morning</i> of the sixteenth,” but it may be eaten only on the fourteenth and fifteenth days and the one intervening night.</i> and when Scripture states <i>on the first day … until the morning</i>, it means the second morning.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">114</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For since the expression “on the first day” means that it may be eaten the whole of the first day of the festival, the term <i>laboker</i> (<i>until the morning</i>) must perforce refer to the morning of the second day.</i> Rashi himself wrote this in the <i>Seder R’eih Anochi</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">112</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 16:4.</i> Here, however, the Rabbi [Rashi] follows the words of Ben Teima,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">111</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Pesachim 71 b.</i> who says that the Festal-offering of the fourteenth of Nisan which comes with the Passover-offering,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">110</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In order that the Passover-offering be eaten after one has satisfied one’s hunger, a Festal-offering was slaughtered on the fourteenth day of Nisan which was eaten on the night of the fifteenth [i.e., the first night of Passover], before the Passover-offering was eaten. Now this Festal-offering was really a peace-offering, and hence it ought to be eaten for two days and the one intervening night. But according to Rashi it is here included in the law of the thanks-offering, to be eaten only for one day and a night.

But according to Ben Teima, these amplifications [referred to by Rashi] only come to indicate that it [the Festal-offering accompanying the Passover-offering] is like the Passover-offering in every respect, coming only from the sheep, a male of the first year,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">115</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 12:5. A peace-offering, on the other hand, can be brought of the cattle, male or female, regardless of the age (above, 3:1).</i> since it is written, <i>Neither shall the offering of the feast of the Passover be left unto the morning</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">116</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 34:25.</i> [which Ben Teima interpreted to mean: “<i>the offering of the feast</i>, namely the Festal-offering; <i>of the Passover</i>, namely the Passover-offering,” the same law thus applying to both], as it is stated there.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">117</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Pesachim 70 a. Ben Teima thus interprets the verse to refer to two separate offerings, and derives the law that they are both to be eaten within the same time not from the amplification of Verse 15 before us, but from the explicit statement in Exodus 34:25: <i>neither shall … be left unto the morning</i>.</i><br>But that which the Rabbi [Rashi] wrote here [namely, that the terms of amplification of the verse teach that the Festal-offering is to be eaten only for a day and a night] is on the basis of a Beraitha<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">118</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See in <i>Seder Vayikra</i> Note 65.</i> taught in the Torath Kohanim,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">119</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Tzav</i> 12:1.</i> which states as follows: “<i>And the flesh of the offering of his peace-offerings for thanksgiving, shall be eaten on the day of his offering</i>. This verse comes to teach that those offerings which Scripture states are to be eaten for one day [and the following night] may only be eaten during that time [and not for two days and the intervening night, as is the period assigned for the peace-offering]. I would only know that such is the law for the thanks-offering [i.e., the offering itself, which is mentioned explicitly in the verse]. Whence do I know to include the breads thereof? Scripture therefore says, <i>his offering</i>. Whence do I know to include the offspring of the thanks-offering and animals substituted for it in the same law?

Scripture therefore says, <i>his peace-offerings</i>.”<br>This is the Beraitha<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">118</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See in <i>Seder Vayikra</i> Note 65.</i> [taught in the Torath Kohanim]. Now the Rabbi [Rashi] explained<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">120</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Zebachim 36 a.</i> the phrase “the peace-offerings which come on account of the Passover-offering” as referring to the Festal-offering of the fourteenth day of Nisan, which comes together with the Passover-offering, [thus providing the authority for his comment here that the Festal-offering of the fourteenth of Nisan may be eaten only during the day and ensuing night.] Thus also I have found in Tractate Pesachim, in the Chapter <i>Mi Shehayah</i> (If any man shall be unclean),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">121</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Pesachim 96 b.</i> that Rashi gave two explanations of this phrase — “the peace-offerings which come on account of the Passover-offering” — and wrote [after explaining the first interpretation]: “Another explanation is that it means the Festal-offering of the fourteenth. This explanation I have heard.” Here then [in his commentary on the Torah] the Rabbi relied on the interpretation he had heard [and consequently he wrote that the Festal-offering of the fourteenth may be eaten only for one day and the following night].<br>But the matter is not so. [The correct explanation of the phrase] “peace-offerings which come on account of the Passover-offering,” is that it refers to [those animals] which remain over from the Passover-offering,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">122</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The term “remain over from the Passover-offering” includes besides the two cases mentioned in the text also the case if he set aside a certain sum of money for the buying of a Passover-offering, and not all the money was used up for that purpose, he must bring a peace-offering from the balance (Pesachim 70 b; Mishneh Torah <i>Hilchoth Korban Pesach</i> 4:10).</i> such as where the owners substituted another one for it, or where the owners of a Passover-offering fulfilled their duty<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">123</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew reads: “<i>shenithkapru</i> (that they were forgiven)” — a term borrowed from a sin-offering. But in the case of the Passover-offering the sense is that the owners had fulfilled their duty through another offering.</i> by bringing another offering. [In these cases they are to be eaten only for one day and the ensuing night], as since they were at the beginning only meant to be eaten for one day and the ensuing night, [namely the night following the day on which they were slaughtered, as is the law of all Passover-offerings], so also in the end [i.e., when they are offered up as peace-offerings they are to be eaten only for one day and the ensuing night]. But the Festal-offering of the fourteenth [since it is not originally brought as a Passover-offering], is eaten for two days [and the intervening night] in accordance with the words of the Sages. So also we have been taught in that very same Beraitha<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">119</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Tzav</i> 12:1.</i> at the end thereof: “<i>And on the morrow</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">124</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 16 here, referring to the peace-offering, which may be eaten on the day it was offered and the ensuing night, <i>and</i> also <i>on the morrow</i>.</i> This verse comes to teach that those offerings which [Scripture states] are to be eaten for two days [and the intervening night] may only be eaten during that time. I know only that this applies to the peace-offering [which is clearly mentioned in the verse]. Whence do I know to include the Festal-offering which comes at its proper time [i.e., the regular Festal-offering of the <i>fifteenth</i> day of Nisan]? etc. Now I know to include the Festal-offering which comes at its regular time. Whence do I know to include the Festal-offering which comes with the Passover-offering [that it may be eaten only for two days and the intervening night]? etc.” [Thus it is clearly stated that the Festal-offering of the <i>fourteenth</i> may be eaten for only two days and the intervening night, and not as Rashi wrote that it may be eaten only for one day and the following night]."

Therefore He explained again, <i>‘and’ that which remaineth</i> is to be eaten on the first day and also on the morrow [if by chance it was not all eaten on the first day]. But he is not to leave some over intentionally, nor is he permitted to leave it all over to be eaten on the second day. Rather, it is a commandment that he should eat it on the first day, and that which is left over by chance, should be eaten on the morrow previously mentioned.<br>This matter we have learned from the words of our Rabbis, who have said in the Torath Kohanim:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">127</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Tzav</i> 12:11-12.</i> “<i>On the day that he offereth it, shall it be eaten</i>.

If [we are to go by the expression] <i>and that which remaineth</i>, I might think that if he left it all over for the second day it is invalid [since that does not come under the term “remaineth” which indicates only a part thereof]; Scripture therefore says [<i>that which remaineth of it</i>] <i>shall be eaten</i>, even all of it.” And even if you hold the <i>vav</i> in <i>v’hanothar</i> (and that which remaineth) to be redundant, [as Rashi explained], the verse can also be explained to mean: “and on the morrow that which remained of it [from the first day] may be eaten,” but not that he is to leave it over intentionally.<br>But I do not know why Rashi held the <i>vav</i> of the verse, <i>to give ‘v’kodesh’</i> (<i>‘and’ the Sanctuary</i>) <i>and the host to be trampled upon</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">126</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Daniel 8:13.

On the basis of this verse Ibn Ezra argued that <i>in all your dwellings</i> applies also to the offerings, since the verse refers to the <i>omer</i> (a measure of new barley brought as a meal-offering on the second day of Passover). But Ramban answers that the phrase refers not to the <i>omer</i>, but to the new crop which, through the offering of the <i>omer</i>, was henceforth permitted to be eaten (see “The Commandments,” Vol. II, pp. 186-188). It is to this prohibition of eating of the new crop before the bringing of the <i>omer</i> [or before the end of the sixteenth day of Nisan], that the phrase <i>in all your dwellings</i> refers. Hence the phrase <i>in all your dwellings</i> which is stated in connection with the prohibitions against eating fat and blood (above, 3:17) must perforce mean that they are applicable everywhere, independent of the existence of the Sanctuary and its offerings.</i> For it is eating of the new crop that is forbidden by law of the Torah in all places, and Scripture is saying that we are not to eat bread, nor parched corn, nor fresh ears forever in all our dwelling places, until that same day on which we bring the offering of the new barley in the Sanctuary. If the offering is not brought [as when the Sanctuary is destroyed], it does not become forbidden henceforth to eat of the new crop [i.e., after the end of the sixteenth day of Nisan], for He did not say, “ye shall not eat until ye have brought the offering of your G-d,” but instead the prohibition extends <i>until this selfsame day</i> only. Rather, the meaning of <i>until this selfsame day</i> is the one on which you bring the offering when you are in a position to do so, the reason being that the offering should be a new meal-offering [but when you are not able to bring the offering, as when the Sanctuary is destroyed, the prohibition is only <i>until this selfsame day</i>]. It is possible that the word <i>hayom</i> (<i>the day</i>) is connected also with [the latter part of the verse:] “<i>until this selfsame day, until the day ye have brought the offering of your G-d</i>,” [thus clearly indicating that the prohibition depends on the <i>day</i> the offering is brought, and not on the actual bringing thereof].<br>The complete proof that the explanation of the phrase [in the verse before us] <i>the beast of which man presents an offering</i>, is “of the kind of beast from which man presents an offering,” [and not “of the beast which is itself an actual offering,” so that the unconsecrated beast would be excluded from the prohibition against eating of the fat thereof,] is that it says also in the section on valuations, <i>And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the Eternal, all that any man giveth of such unto the Eternal shall be holy</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">140</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 27:9.</i> and it explains that this means the kind of beast whereof men bring an offering to G-d. And so also, <i>And if it be any unclean beast, of which they may not bring an offering unto the Eternal</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">141</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 11.</i> here clearly stating, “any unclean beast of the kind from which offerings are not brought.” There is no difference whatever between stating it in the plural — <i>whereof men bring</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">140</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 27:9.</i> <i>of which they may not bring</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">141</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 11.</i> — or saying it in the singular [as in the verse before us], <i>of which man presents</i>, for the meaning is “the kind of beast of which man presents an offering.” Similarly He said, <i>And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">142</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 11:39.</i> which means the kind of beast of which ye may eat, but not that the particular beast may be eaten [since it is expressly prohibited as meat, as it died without being slaughtered properly].<br>Now since He prohibited all fat of a beast whereof an offering is brought, but not of the kind of which offerings are not brought, it might enter one’s mind to say that a beast which died of itself or was torn [by other beasts] is regarded as a kind from which offerings may not be brought [and therefore their fats may be eaten]; therefore it was necessary to mention [in Verse 24] that [the fats of these animals] are forbidden, and it is this which He said, <i>and ye shall in no wise eat of it</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">134</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 24.</i> meaning that he who eats it is liable to excision as with all other fats, as He forbade the fat of the entire class of beasts from which offerings are brought, even of those animals which died of themselves or were torn by [wild] beasts.

Thus [all] the commandments in the Book of Vayikra (Leviticus) [which is prefaced by the verse stating it was made known in the Tent of Meeting], are repetitions [of those said on Sinai, which is the sense of the verse before us]. By way of the plain meaning of Scripture, the meaning of the verse is:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">155</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse reads: <i>Which the Eternal commanded Moses in Mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to present their offerings unto the Eternal, in the wilderness of Sinai</i>. Now according to the interpretation of the Rabbis mentioned above, the sense of the verse is that the laws of the offerings were commanded to Moses “in Mount Sinai,” and were repeated to him in the Tent of Meeting “in the wilderness of Sinai.” Ramban will now explain that according to the plain meaning of Scripture this verse speaks of two separate occasions: the offerings of the seven-day consecration of the priests were commanded to Moses “in Mount Sinai,” whilst the laws of the other offerings were given to Moses “in the wilderness of Sinai,” that is, in the Tabernacle.</i> “<i>Which the Eternal commanded Moses in Mount Sinai</i>, and <i>in the day that he commanded the children of Israel</i> in the wilderness of Sinai <i>to present their offerings unto the Eternal</i>,” for He gave the commandment about the consecration-offerings [of the priests] <i>in Mount Sinai</i>, as also in the case of the burnt-offering and sin-offering [which were part of the consecration], and He commanded concerning the meal-offering, guilt-offering, and peace-offerings, <i>in the wilderness of Sinai</i>, in the Tent of Meeting.<br>It is possible that the expression <i>in Mount Sinai</i> means “in this place in front of Mount Sinai,” which is in the Tent of Meeting. Similarly, <i>It is a continual burnt-offering, which was offered in Mount Sinai</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">156</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 28:6.</i> does not mean on the mountain itself, for the continual burnt-offering [i.e., the Daily Whole-offering brought for all Israel] began only in the Tent of Meeting, as it is written, <i>Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar: two lambs of the first year day by day continually</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">157</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 29:38.</i> So also: <i>And they set forward from the Mount of the Eternal</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">158</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 10:33.</i> [which means “from before the Mount of the Eternal”]; <i>ye have dwelt long enough in this mountain</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">159</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 1:6.</i> [which means “in front of this mountain”]. The sense of all these verses is that Israel had encamped before Mount Sinai nearby, as it is written, <i>and there Israel encamped before the Mount</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">160</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 19:2.</i> There [in the wilderness of Sinai] they stayed until they journeyed from there to the wilderness of Paran.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">161</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 10:12: <i>And the children of Israel set forward by their stages out of the wilderness of Sinai, and the cloud abode in the wilderness of Paran</i>.</i> Thus they made the Tent of Meeting and erected it before the Mount on its east side, and it was there that they began offering the Daily Whole-offering. In the second year [after the exodus] they were commanded concerning the standards,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">162</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 1:1; 2:1-31.</i> and they set the Tent of Meeting <i>in the midst of the camps</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">163</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 2:17.</i> when they journeyed. It is for this reason that Scripture says here that <i>this is the law of the burnt-offering</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">164</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 37 here.</i> and of all the offerings which G-d commanded [Moses] <i>in Mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded</i> [<i>the children of Israel</i>] … <i>in the wilderness of Sinai</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">165</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 38 here.</i> Scripture thus states that it was in Mount Sinai and in the desert of Sinai, in order to inform us that it was not on the mountain itself, in the place of the Glory where G-d told to Moses the Ten Commandments, nor in the desert of Sinai after they had journeyed from before the Mount. Rather, it was in the wilderness of Sinai, in front of the mountain within its environs and nearby, and there was the Tent of Meeting, as He said at the beginning of the subject of the offerings, <i>And He called unto Moses, and the Eternal spoke unto him out of the Tent of Meeting</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">166</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 1:1.</i> and now He informed us of the place of the Tent of Meeting."

                    "TAKE AARON. “This section [concerning the seven days of consecration of the priests] was said seven days before the [final] erection of the Tabernacle [which took place on the first day of Nisan],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">167</sup><i class=\"footnote\">During each of the seven days of consecration Moses set the Tabernacle up and then dismantled it. But on the eighth day [which was the first of Nisan] the final erection took place, and it was no longer dismantled until they journeyed from Mount Sinai.</i> for there is no strict chronological order in the narrative of the Torah.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">168</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the final erection of the Tabernacle is already mentioned at the end of the Book of Exodus (40:17), and the section before us, according to Rashi, was said seven days <i>before</i> the final erection, we must perforce say that there is no strict chronological order in the narrative of the Torah. In other words, chronologically the proper place of this section here in the Book of Leviticus is before Exodus, Chapter 40! Ramban will strongly dissent to this interpretation of Rashi.</i> Thus the language of Rashi. But why should we invert the words of the living G-d! Moreover, in the section of <i>On the first day of the first month</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">169</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 40:2.</i> He commanded concerning the erection of the whole Tabernacle, the clothing of Aaron and his sons and the anointing of all of them, and there He narrated Moses’ deeds in the matter of the erection of the Tabernacle,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">170</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 17-33.</i> but did not mention anything concerning Aaron and his sons till here. And how could it be that He separated one subject into two sections, [as follows from Rashi], placing the later one [i.e., the final erection of the Tabernacle which took place on the first of Nisan, as recorded in the Book of Exodus], before the earlier one [i.e., the seven days of consecration that began on the twenty-third of Adar which He placed here in the Book of Leviticus]!<br>Rather, the correct interpretation is that we say that Moses was commanded about the erection of the Tabernacle on the twenty-third day of Adar, and he erected it [on that day]. As soon as the Tabernacle stood in its position G-d, blessed be He, <i>Who sitteth upon the cherubim</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">171</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 4:4.</i> called Moses and commanded him about the actions involved in the bringing of the offerings — all those sections from the beginning of the Book of <i>Vayikra</i> until here. [This was because] He wanted to teach him the actions and statutes of all the offerings before he offered up any of them, since among the initiation-offerings were the sin-offering, burnt-offering and peace-offering, and they could only know all their laws from these sections with which He preceded [to command <i>him</i>]. Afterwards He said to him, <i>Take Aaron and his sons with him</i> etc., to urge him on when the time came for performing what He had told him at first — <i>And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow them, to minister unto Me etc</i>.,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">172</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 29:1.</i> adding here, <i>And assemble thou all the congregation at the door of the Tent of Meeting</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">173</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 3 here.</i> so that it should be done in the presence of all of them, that they should know that G-d, blessed be He, chose Aaron and his sons [to minister unto Him].<br>By way of the proper interpretation of Scripture, Moses was commanded about the building of the Tabernacle prior to the incident of the golden calf [as is the order of these chapters in the Book of Exodus],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">174</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The commandment concerning the building of the Tabernacle is in <i>Seder Terumah</i> (Chapters 25-27), and the story of the golden calf is in <i>Seder Ki Thisa</i> (Chapter 32). — This is unlike Rashi’s statement (<i>ibid.</i>, 31:18) that the incident of the golden calf happened a considerable time before the command regarding the work of the Tabernacle. Hence Ramban preceded this discussion with the expression, “by way of the proper interpretation …” in order to indicate that his view is different than that stated elsewhere in Rashi’s commentary.</i> and when the Holy One, blessed be He, became reconciled to him and promised him that He would cause His Divine Glory to dwell among them, Moses understood of his own accord that the command concerning the Tabernacle remained valid as before, and he then commanded Israel regarding it, as I have explained in the section of <i>Vayakheil</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">175</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 35:1.</i> After they had completed the work, he was then told the section of <i>On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the Tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">176</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 40:2.</i> and he was then told, <i>And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the Tent of Meeting</i> etc.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">177</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 12.</i> Thus Moses knew that Aaron and his sons also remained in their esteemed and beloved position before G-d. Here He urged them again on the first day of the consecration, at the time of performing the command [<i>And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons</i> etc.]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">177</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 12.</i> Thus all the sections of the Torah are in chronological order, except that He placed before its sequence the verse, <i>And the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">178</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 34.</i> which in the opinion of our Rabbis<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">179</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, at the beginning of <i>Seder Shemini</i>.</i> was on the eighth day of the initiation, in order to arrange in order the whole matter of the erection of the Tabernacle, it being the customary way of Scripture in all places to finish a subject that it has started to explain.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">180</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Vol. I, p. 431, for a similar instance.</i>"

Moses thus sanctified the altar in the same way that he was commanded to do to the ministering priests, concerning whom He said, <i>and thou shalt sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">194</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 29:21.</i> since the altar, which is the vessel for the offerings, is not of a lesser degree of holiness than the garments of the ministering priests, and it is an inference from minor to major [that if the garments had to be sprinkled with the anointing oil, surely the altar, being more holy, had to be sprinkled]! And so also is it said with reference to the Day of Atonement, <i>And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it</i> [the altar] <i>with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleannesses of the children of Israel</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">195</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 16:19.</i> Thus [we see that] all sanctifications of the altar were done by sprinklings, and it follows all the more so that [when the altar was consecrated] at the very beginning that it had to be sanctified by sprinkling from uncleanness and “strangeness” [i.e., from that which is not holy].<br>Scripture did not mention here [in Verse 13] the anointing of Aaron’s sons, for it is self-evident that Moses did to them as he did to their father, in accordance with that which he was commanded, <i>And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">196</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 40:15.</i> and He included it here in saying with reference to the sons that everything was done <i>as the Eternal commanded Moses</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">197</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 13.</i><br>It appears to me that the anointing of Aaron’s sons was not done by means of pouring the oil on their heads, for that is said only of Aaron, <i>Then shalt thou take the anointing oil, and pour it upon his</i> [Aaron’s] <i>head, and anoint him</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">198</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 29:7.</i> but the anointing of the sons is not mentioned there at all, as it was not done by means of pouring the oil as in Aaron’s case. It is [also] possible that there was no anointing of the sons, except for the sprinklings which Moses sprinkled on Aaron’s sons and their garments from the oil of anointment.

The correct interpretation is that the expression <i>and unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak</i>, means you [Aaron] and the elders mentioned [in Verse 1], since it was for that purpose that he called them,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As Verse 1 states: <i>And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel</i>.</i> so that they should speak to the children of Israel, as in the verse, <i>And Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them: Draw out</i> [<i>and take you lambs</i>].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 12:21.</i> Or it may be that [Moses] said to each of the elders, <i>and unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak</i> [the singular word <i>thou</i> thus referring to each one of the elders].

Rather, after Moses had mentioned to them the offerings [which they were required to bring on that day], <i>and they brought that which Moses commanded</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 5.</i> he said to them again, <i>This is the thing which the Eternal commanded that ye should do</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 6.</i> meaning that they should bring the offerings in the order that he would command them, and afterwards the Glory of the Eternal would appear to them.

Thus they interpreted: “For what reason did Israel bring more offerings [on this day] than Aaron?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Israel’s sin-offering on that day was a he-goat, while Aaron’s was a calf. As a burnt-offering Israel brought a calf and a ram, while Aaron’s was only a ram. The Torath Kohanim suggests a reason why the people’s offerings had to be more than those of Aaron, and also why their sin-offering was a he-goat, unlike that of Aaron which was a calf.</i> It was on account of what He said to them: ‘You [the people] have in your hands [sin] at the beginning, and you have in your hands [sin] at the end.’ You have sinned at the beginning, as it is written [when the brothers sold Joseph], <i>and they killed a he-goat</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 37:31.</i> and you have sinned at the end, as it is said, <i>they have made them a molten calf</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 32:8.</i> Therefore let them bring the he-goat [for a sin-offering] to atone for the incident connected with that of the he-goat, and let them bring a calf [as a burnt-offering] to atone for the incident of the golden calf.”<br>It would appear that because the reason for Aaron’s sin-offering [on this eighth day] was the same as that of his sin-offering on the Day of Atonement, therefore he burnt it [outside the camp]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 11. Rashi wrote that this was done at the express command of G-d. But Ramban at this point suggests that this procedure was adopted on the basis of a similar law on the Day of Atonement, since the reason for both offerings was identical.</i> as the one of the Day of Atonement is burnt,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 16:27.</i> even though this sin-offering [of the eighth day] was “an outer sin-offering”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See in <i>Seder Tzav</i>, Note 52. Ramban’s concluding thought here — “for Moses did not explain that he should do so” — is thus to be understood as follows: Since Scripture does not relate that Moses commanded Aaron to burn his sin-offering outside the camp although it was not “an inner sin-offering,” the question arises why did Aaron do so [as stated in Verse 11]? It must be, Ramban suggests, because the reason for Aaron’s sin-offering on this eighth day of the initiation was the same as that of his sin-offering on the Day of Atonement, which being “an inner sin-offering” is rightfully burnt outside the camp, and hence Aaron on this eighth day did similarly. In the text following, Ramban will suggest that Aaron actually received this command from Moses, and the reason why Scripture did not mention it is explained in the text of Ramban.</i> [while that of the Day of Atonement was “an inner sin-offering”], for Moses did not explain that he should do so. But perhaps Aaron was indeed so commanded, and [it is not mentioned because] Scripture did not want to prolong the matter, it being known that Aaron would only do what Moses said, and that Moses would only say what G-d had commanded."

Was it not so that you minister before G-d? Embolden yourself and come and do your priestly activities.’ Some Rabbis say that Aaron saw the [horned] altar in <i>the form of the bull</i> [which — as stated in Psalms 106: 20 — Israel had worshipped], and he was frightened by it. Then Moses came near and said to him, ‘My brother, Aaron, do not be afraid of that which you fear. Embolden yourself and come near it.’ This is why he said, <i>draw near unto the altar</i>, and [Aaron] drew near unto the altar — with zeal.” The reason for this [apparition which Aaron saw in the altar] was that since Aaron was <i>the holy one of the Eternal</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 106:16.</i> having no sin on his soul except for the incident of the golden calf, therefore that sin was firmly fixed in his mind, something like that which is said, <i>and my sin is ever before me</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 51:5.</i> It thus appeared to him as if the form of the calf was there [in the altar] preventing his [attaining] atonement [through the offerings he was to bring].

But Scripture did not have to mention this about the seven days of consecration [namely that the offerings of those days were to be offered <i>besides the burnt-offering of the morning</i>], because those were offerings of individuals [i.e., Aaron and his sons] to consecrate them as priests, and it is self-understood that such offerings did not exempt [them from bringing] the Daily burnt-offering, nor did they precede it.<br>In the Torath Kohanim the Rabbis have taught:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, beginning of <i>Shemini</i> 12.

What does this come to teach us? Shall we say it teaches us that if he could not obtain the meal-offering [which was offered with every burnt-offering] that he should nevertheless bring the animal [as a burnt-offering]? [That could not be the case], for it has already been stated, <i>And the burnt-offering was presented, and he offered it according to the ordinances</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 16.</i> If so, why does it say, <i>and he burnt it</i> [i.e., the meal-offering] <i>upon the altar, besides the burnt-offering of the morning</i>? It is to teach us that there were two meal-offerings there, one for the [Daily] burnt-offering and one [brought] by itself” [for the burnt-offering of the people, which was a special offering of that eighth day].<br>The meaning of this text [of the Torath Kohanim] is as follows: Had Scripture stated, “And the burnt-offering was presented, and he offered it according to the ordinance, besides the burnt-offering of the morning,” the sense thereof would have been to teach that the Daily burnt-offering precedes [the other offerings], as He says in the section of the Additional Offerings, <i>it shall be offered beside the continual burnt-offering, and the drink-offering thereof;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 28:15.</i> <i>beside the continual burnt-offering</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 31.</i> But since He mentioned the meal-offering — stating, <i>And the meal-offering was presented; and he filled his hand therefrom, and burnt it on the altar, besides the burnt-offering of the morning</i> — it appears that [the phrase, <i>besides the burnt-offering of the morning</i>] is said with reference to the meal-offering. Therefore the Rabbis commented that if it comes to say that he offered this meal-offering alone, but did not offer the drink-offering of the Daily burnt-offering nor that of the people’s burnt-offering [of the eighth day], because he only found [ingredients] for this freewill meal-offering — [that could not be the case]. For [in the preceding verse] it has already been stated, <i>And the burnt-offering was presented, and he offered it according to the ordinance</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 16. This shows that the drink-offering was brought together with the people’s burnt-offering of the eighth day, for otherwise it would not have been <i>according to the ordinance</i>. The question then re-appears: why is the phrase <i>besides the burnt-offering of the morning</i> mentioned in connection with the meal-offering?</i> which means that it was offered according to its ordinance, with the drink-offering. [Thus we cannot derive from here a principle that the lack of the drink-offering does not prevent the bringing of the offering itself, if the meal-offering and the wine for the drink-offering are not obtainable.] If so, why does it say, <i>And the meal-offering was presented</i> etc. <i>and he burnt it on the altar, besides the burnt-offering of the morning</i>? It is to teach that he offered this meal-offering [of the people’s burnt-offering brought on the eighth day] “<i>besides the burnt-offering of the morning</i> and its meal-offering,” for this meal-offering was not the drink-offering [which is an obligatory part of the Daily burnt-offering], but was the <i>freewill</i> meal-offering of Israel [namely part of the burnt-offering of the people which they brought on that day].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For one might have thought that since the burnt-offering of the people brought especially on this eighth day was also a public one, it should be exempted from the duty of bringing a meal-offering, as the meal-offering of the Daily Whole-offering had already been brought; hence Scripture stated that this meal-offering which came with the people’s burnt-offering, was offered “<i>besides the burnt-offering of the morning</i> and its meal-offering.” It should be pointed out that Ramban refers to this meal-offering as <i>minchath-nedavah</i> (“<i>freewill</i> — meal-offering”) not because of its voluntary nature, namely that it be optional for Israel to bring it or not. The name <i>minchath-nedavah</i> is only to distinguish it from the meal-offering which constantly accompanied the Daily Whole-offering of the people, while this one represented the willing spirit of the people on this day.

For by way of the plain meaning of Scripture, the expression “G-d spoke” refers to His decrees, His thought, and the manner of His ways, and the term “speaking” is used with reference to all these [in humans].

And if so, why the opinion of Rabbi Akiba that Mishael and Elzaphan put iron hooks on the bodies of Nadab and Abihu in order to remove them from the Sanctuary when they could have gone in directly and remove them? See “The Commandments,” Vol. II, pp. 66-67.</i> this prohibition applies only if they enter it needlessly. But one may enter the Sanctuary in order to remove an uncleanness, or to make Temple repairs. For thus we were taught in the Torath Kohanim:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">77</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 3:11.</i> “I might think one is not permitted to enter the Sanctuary to make the beaten plates [for a covering of the golden altar, or for the Holy of Holies]; Scripture therefore says, <i>‘Only’ he shall not go in unto the Veil</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">78</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 21:23.</i> [the word ‘only’ denoting an exception to the general law]; such is their command: priests may go in there [at any time to make the above repairs]. If there are no priests present, Levites may enter. If there are no [ritually] pure ones [priests or Levites], impure ones may go in. If there are no unblemished ones, blemished ones may enter there.” Now on that day [when Nadab and Abihu died] there were no priests present [who could remove them from the Sanctuary where they had died], since [Aaron and his two remaining sons] were expressly commanded that they should not defile themselves for them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">79</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 7. — So the question appears: Why did Mishael and Elzaphan have to resort to the use of iron hooks when they could have entered the Sanctuary? The answer is: since it was possible etc.</i> But since it was possible to do it through dragging them out with iron hooks, [Mishael and Elzaphan] were not permitted to enter there. [Such is the opinion of Rabbi Akiba.] But Rabbi Eliezer, who is of the opinion [that an angel thrust Nadab and Abihu out of the Sanctuary, and they died outside, thinks] that since Scripture states of Mishael and Elzaphan, <i>so they drew near</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">74</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 5.</i> it was outside the Sanctuary [that they died], and therefore he does not say [as does Rabbi Akiba] that they dragged them outside in their tunics. The meaning of the expression <i>in their tunics</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">74</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 5.</i> is that Nadab and Abihu were then dressed in the priestly garments. Moses thus commanded that they carry them <i>out of the camp</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">74</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 5.</i> and there they should strip them of their priestly garments, and clothe them in burial shrouds, and bury them, as was their custom with other people who died in the desert.

He treated this strictly by making them liable to death [by the hand of Heaven] if they would disturb the joyous occasion in any way.<br>It is possible that Moses was commanded about this from the mouth of the Almighty, even though it is not expressly written, or that he derived it from that which he was commanded [to relay to Aaron and his sons for the seven days of consecration], <i>and ye shall keep the charge of the Eternal, that ye die not</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">91</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 8:35.</i> [from which Moses learned] that <i>the charge of the Eternal</i> includes also the eighth day. Now it was revealed to and known by the Creator of the world that the sons of Aaron were destined to be <i>onenim</i>, and yet He commanded that they should not leave the Sanctuary; thus [we see that here exceptionally] they were not to defile themselves for the dead or to mourn at all.<br>Now <i>the sons of Aaron, the priests that were anointed</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">92</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 3:3.</i> even though they were ordinary priests, yet [G-d] made the law applicable to them during the days of the consecration to be like the law of the priest anointed for war in future generations,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">93</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Horayoth 12 b.</i> since he [too] must not let his hair grow long or rend his garments or defile himself for deceased relatives, just like the High Priest, but he may not perform the rites of offerings whilst he is an <i>onen</i> [although the High Priest may do so]. Thus Aaron’s sons, too, did not perform the rites of the offerings on that day, as the Rabbis interpreted:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">94</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zebachim 101 a.</i> “<i>And Aaron spoke unto Moses: Behold, this day have they offered their sin-offering</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">95</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 19.</i> Did they [i.e., my sons] then bring the offering — they who are ordinary priests? It was I [Aaron] that offered — I who am the High Priest [who may offer even when being an <i>onen</i>].” Now during this entire incident nothing [which was to be done during] the consecration was abolished, since the offerings had already been brought, and at night they all ate of the hallowed food which they were to eat. It is possible that this law applied to Elazar and Ithamar [Aaron’s remaining sons] all their lives, namely, that their laws be like those of the priest anointed for war [as mentioned above], because they had been anointed with the oil of anointment, this being the sense of the expression, [<i>And ye shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting …</i>] <i>for the anointing oil of the Eternal is upon you</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 7.</i><br>I have already mentioned<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">97</sup><i class=\"footnote\">At the end of <i>Seder Tzav</i>, Verse 35.</i> the Beraitha of the Torath Kohanim<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">98</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Shemini Milu’im</i> 42.</i> which states: “<i>And ye shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 7.</i> I might think that [on becoming apprised of the death of a near relative, an ordinary priest may not leave the Sanctuary] whether he is ministering or not; Scripture therefore says, <i>Neither shall he go out of the Sanctuary, nor profane</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">99</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 21:12.</i> When is he not permitted to go out, so that [only by his staying there] he does not profane it?

I might think that this tells me only that Aaron and his sons, who were anointed with the oil of anointment, are liable to death if they leave the Sanctuary whilst they are ministering.

Scripture therefore says, <i>for the anointing oil of the Eternal is upon you</i>.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">100</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ramban above, 8:35, at end of verse, for explanation of this final interpretation.</i> Similarly have I also seen in the Tosephta<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">101</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Supplement.” After the Mishnah was completed by Rabbi Yehudah Hanasi, a contemporary of his, Rabbi Chiya, compiled a collection of Tannaitic statements and traditions closely allied in form to the Mishnah.

But since it was Aaron who brought the offerings on that day, therefore [Moses] warned him [especially] that he should not leave the Service and go out. His sons, however, were <i>onenim</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">85</sup><i class=\"footnote\">An <i>onen</i> by law of the Torah is a mourner on the day of death of his relative whether before or after burial on that day. [On the night following he is an <i>onen</i> by law of the Rabbis. If burial has not taken place on the day of death he continues to be an <i>onen</i> by law of the Rabbis. When burial finally takes place he is an <i>onen</i> by law of the Rabbis even after burial, but at night he is no longer considered an <i>onen</i> at all.] An <i>onen</i> is to be distinguished from an <i>avel</i> who is a mourner for a period of seven or thirty days. The laws of mourning as affecting the Divine Service in the Tabernacle and its holy offerings relate to the priest when he is an <i>onen</i>.</i> on that day and did not perform the Service. If so, [the question appears]: how were they included in this warning [not to leave the Service and go out of the Sanctuary, when they were in fact doing no Service to begin with]? Perhaps we may say that Moses said to all of them, <i>and ye shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting</i> at the time of the Service, <i>lest ye die</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 7.</i> and they knew that Aaron [as High Priest] could perform the rites of offering [although] an <i>onen</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">85</sup><i class=\"footnote\">An <i>onen</i> by law of the Torah is a mourner on the day of death of his relative whether before or after burial on that day.

It is for this reason that He said here in an unqualified manner, <i>and ye shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 7.</i> and did not explain until when this [prohibition] applied, whether until the evening or the next day, since His intent was that they should not leave the Service, and this was to be a commandment applying to all generations.<br>It is possible that the command to the sons of Aaron was a special decision, that they should not go out from there on that day<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">102</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Having explained above that the admonition applied to Aaron’s sons not on that eighth day, but its effect began from the following day onwards, when they would be permitted to minister in the Sanctuary, Ramban now writes that it was possibly a special decision that even on that eighth day they should not leave the Sanctuary, just like their father, who, as High Priest, was permitted to bring offerings as an <i>onen</i> and was therefore prohibited from leaving the Sanctuary. This was to serve as a mark of honor and indication of the joyousness of the occasion.</i> [specifically], just as their father [could not leave], this being in honor of the joyous occasion [i.e., the culmination of the erection of the Tabernacle and inauguration of the priests], but ordinary priests throughout the generations are warned against leaving their Service on the basis of the verse which states, <i>Neither shall he go out of the Sanctuary, nor profane</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">99</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 21:12.</i> which means that any priest who goes out of the Sanctuary and leaves his Service profanes it thereby. Thus the verse here [<i>And ye shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting, lest ye die, for the anointing oil of the Eternal is upon you</i>],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 7.</i> is only necessary to derive the punishment, that whoever leaves the Service and goes out is subject to death [by the hand of Heaven], for it says, <i>for the anointing oil of the Eternal is upon you</i>, and that anointment is upon them for all generations, as it says, <i>and their anointing oil shall be to them for an everlasting priesthood</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">103</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 40:15.</i> So also the Rabbis taught in the Beraitha of Torath Kohanim:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">104</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Shemini Milu’im</i> 28.</i> “From here the Rabbis have derived the principle that no mark of mourning whatever is shown for those executed by the court.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">105</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“The analogy is not complete. For those executed by the court no one mourns, neither close relatives nor anyone else. Here only the close relatives were forbidden to mourn, while for others it was expressly commanded, <i>let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the Eternal hath kindled</i>” (Verse 6) (Rabad, in his commentary on Torath Kohanim).</i> Perhaps you will say, ‘We [the brothers] will go to our homes and mourn, grieve and cry [over the death of Nadab and Abihu], behold G-d has already commanded us not to go out of the Sanctuary.’” From this text it would appear that it was a special decision to the effect that those who died through the Heavenly Court, should be treated like those executed by a [human] court for transgressions, in which case the rule is that [the relatives of the executed] come and greet the judges and the witnesses.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">106</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 46 a. “As if to say, ‘We have nothing against you in our hearts, for you have judged the judgment of truth’” (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> Here too, they were to remain standing before G-d <i>in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">107</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Song of Songs 3:11.</i> “<i>In the day of his espousals</i> — this is the day of Sinai [i.e., the Giving of the Torah]. <i>And in the day of the gladness of his heart</i> — this is the day [of the setting up] of the Tent of Meeting.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">108</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There are various versions to this interpretation.

                    "DRINK NO WINE NOR STRONG DRINK. “[Do not drink] wine to such an extent that it has an intoxicating effect.” This is Rashi’s language. The meaning thereof is that if he paused during the drinking [of a fourth of a log of wine], or if he mixed a little water into it, he is free from punishment. The opinion of the Rabbi [Rashi] is thus that the priests were only prohibited from drinking wine, but not from other intoxicating drinks, the meaning of the term <i>sheichar</i> (strong drink) mentioned here being derived from the law of the Nazirite [where a similar expression appears,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">109</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>He shall abstain from wine and ‘sheichar’</i> (<i>strong drink</i>) (Numbers 6:3).</i> and only wine is forbidden to him].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">110</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word <i>sheichar</i> must not therefore be understood as strong drink [as it is found in all English translations], but rather as “strong wine.” The <i>vav</i> in the Hebrew <i>yayin v’sheichar</i> (literally: “wine <i>and</i> strong wine”) is thus to be understood as if it said <i>yayin k’shehu sheichar</i> — you must not drink “wine when it is strong wine,” or “when it is intoxicating” (Mizrachi). Rambam’s opinion, however, as mentioned further on in the text, is that <i>sheichar</i> means “strong drink,” and the priests were warned against both — wine and strong drink, although the punishment for violation was different for each.</i> This is correct according to my opinion. But in the opinion of Rabbi Moshe [ben Maimon],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">111</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishneh Torah, <i>Hilchoth Bi’ath Hamikdash</i> 1:2.</i> however, other intoxicating drinks are prohibited [through a negative commandment, without being punishable by death, and the Service performed after drinking them is not invalidated, whereas for drinking wine the punishment is death by the hand of Heaven, and the Service is invalidated]; thus <i>sheichar</i> is to be understood in its plain sense [i.e., strong drink]. The reason why this commandment was given at that time, was in order that the priest should not go astray through the intoxicating effect of wine, and thus come to entertain some improper thought which might cause his death, as happened to [Aaron’s] sons. It is possible that when the Rabbis interpreted<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">112</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Vayikra Rabbah 12:1.</i> that Nadab and Abihu died because they entered the Sanctuary whilst intoxicated by wine, they meant to say that it was because of the wine they had drunk that they erred in the matter of the strange fire,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">113</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 1.</i> but not that their punishment actually was because they had drunk the wine, since they had not yet been warned against it.

                    "WHEN YE GO INTO THE TENT OF MEETING. “From this verse I know only [that they are forbidden to drink wine and strong drink] when they go into the Sanctuary.

See also my Hebrew commentary, p. 51, for a different commentary on this text by Rabad.</i> and the altar similar to the Tent of Meeting, and the penalty of death [by the hand of Heaven] is only if he performed the Service [without washing], so here also He made going out [of the Sanctuary] similar to going into it,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">119</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus if he drank the wine whilst inside the Sanctuary and performed the Service, he is liable just like when he drank the wine outside the Sanctuary and entered it in a state of intoxication (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> and the altar similar to the Tent of Meeting, and the punishment is only if he performs the Service [whilst intoxicated].” That is to say, the liability [to punishment] is only if the priest performs the Service, whether he entered while drunk, or drank there [after he had come in] and then performed some Service. There [in the Sifra]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">120</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Shemini</i> 1:5.</i> the Rabbis have said: “<i>It shall be a statute forever</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">121</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Verse 9 before us.</i> This includes the pouring of oil [upon the flour of a meal-offering], mixing it, waving it, bringing near [the meal-offering to the altar], removing the handful and burning it, pinching a bird’s head, and sprinkling the blood,” [so that all these acts must not be done by the priest while drunk, and if he did any of them in that state, he is liable to death by the hand of Heaven]. For since Scripture stated, <i>to burn a fire-offering unto the Eternal</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">114</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>When they go into the Tent of Meeting, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn a fire-offering unto the Eternal</i> (Exodus 30:20).</i> [I might have excluded these acts from this law since they are not “a fire-offering”], therefore it was necessary to include them [here in the verse before us].<br>It further appears that this liability [to punishment] does not apply where one offers up on a <i>bamah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">122</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “a high place.” This was an altar built prior to the establishment of a central Sanctuary, on which offerings to G-d could be brought; on such an altar even a non-priest could perform the rites of offering. <i>Bamoth</i> were permitted until the eighth day of consecration when the Tabernacle was erected, but from that day onwards they were prohibited until the people came into the Land of Israel, when for a period of fourteen years comprising the conquest and division of the Land, the Tabernacle was at Gilgal, and <i>bamoth</i> were temporarily permitted. Then a central Sanctuary was built at Shiloh, which lasted for 369 years, and during that time the <i>bamoth</i> were again prohibited. After the Philistines destroyed the Sanctuary at Shiloh, the <i>bamoth</i> were once again permitted. This period [covering also the reigns of Saul and David] lasted 57 years, and is known as that of Nob and Gibeon. Then finally the Sanctuary at Jerusalem was built, and from then on the <i>bamoth</i> were prohibited forever, since that is “the Eternal House,” so that even when it was destroyed, the place is still holy. — From this account it is thus clear why as stated in the Torath Kohanim [mentioned further on in the text] the central Sanctuary at Shiloh and “the Eternal House” at Jerusalem were alike as far as the prohibition to perform the Service while drunk is concerned. In both only a priest could perform the Service, while at a <i>bamah</i> even an Israelite was permitted to do it.</i> That is why the Rabbis said there [in the Torath Kohanim]:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">120</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Shemini</i> 1:5.</i> “From this verse I know only that it is prohibited [to perform the Service] in the Tent of Meeting [while drunk]. Whence do I know to include the Sanctuary at Shiloh and the Eternal House at Jerusalem? Scripture therefore says, <i>it shall be a statute for ever</i>.” For this prohibition applies to the priests performing their Services, and it was not necessary that it be a priest who performed the Service at a <i>bamah;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">122</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “a high place.” This was an altar built prior to the establishment of a central Sanctuary, on which offerings to G-d could be brought; on such an altar even a non-priest could perform the rites of offering. <i>Bamoth</i> were permitted until the eighth day of consecration when the Tabernacle was erected, but from that day onwards they were prohibited until the people came into the Land of Israel, when for a period of fourteen years comprising the conquest and division of the Land, the Tabernacle was at Gilgal, and <i>bamoth</i> were temporarily permitted.

In both only a priest could perform the Service, while at a <i>bamah</i> even an Israelite was permitted to do it.</i> [therefore the prohibition did not apply there].<br>Now the meaning of the expression <i>when ye go into the Tent of Meeting</i>, is “when you perform Service,” and He used this expression because all the Services were done there, either inside the Tent or at the altar of the burnt-offering which was at the door of the Tent of Meeting. The general principle then, is that the prohibition and punishment in these matters are only to the effect that the priest should not perform the Service while drunk with wine or with hands and feet unwashed, likewise if he lacks any of the required priestly garments; but merely for entering the Sanctuary in these conditions, there is no prohibition in the Torah. Thus that which we have been taught in the Mishnah:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">123</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Keilim 1:9.</i> “Rabbi Yosei says: In five things is the space between the Porch [of the Sanctuary] and the altar equal to the Sanctuary: that those priests may not enter there who have a blemish, or who have dishevelled hair,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">124</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In our Mishnah: “or who have dishevelled hair, or who have drunk wine.”</i> or who have hands and feet unwashed” and the whole Mishnah there — all these are gradations of <i>Rabbinic</i> enactment [and are not matters prohibited by Scriptural law].

But why Scripture divided them, mentioning ‘heaving’ in connection with the thigh and ‘waving’ in connection with the breast, I do not know, for both of them [required] waving and heaving.” Thus far is the language of Rashi.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">127</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This whole text of Rashi quoted by Ramban is missing in all standard versions of Rashi. It is found, however, in the Reggio edition of 1475, “Rashi’s Commentary to the Pentateuch.” This book incidentally was the first Hebrew book to appear in print. A facsimilie thereof has lately appeared in Jerusalem.</i><br>It appears to me that the reason for it is that during the [seven days of] consecration, the thigh was a heave-offering to G-d, being burned together with the bread and the fats,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">128</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 29:22-25.</i> and that which is set aside from a peace-offering [to be burnt on the altar] is called “a heave-offering,” just as it is said, <i>And of it he shall offer one out of each offering for a heave-offering unto the Eternal</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">129</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 7:14.</i> and [it follows] all the more so that these parts [of the ram of consecration] offered on the altar, were all “a heave-offering unto the Eternal.” [Hence the expression “the thigh of <i>heaving</i>.”] It was not called by the term “waving,” for that movement [to and fro in a horizontal direction] was done to the thigh together with the fats and the bread so as to burn them unto the Eternal. The breast, however, was waved by itself, and was only different from the rest of the meat [which was to be eaten by the priests] in that it was waved, and it was through this waving alone that it became sanctified and that Moses acquired it as his portion.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">130</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is so clearly stated in Exodus 29:26: <i>And thou</i> [Moses] <i>shalt take the breast of Aaron’s ram of consecration, and wave it for a wave-offering before the Eternal; and it shall be thy portion</i>.</i> Now since the right of Aaron and his sons to the breast and thigh [of peace-offerings] in future generations was [derived] from the day of their consecration as priests, when they acquired the thigh through its being a heave-offering to G-d and the breast through its being waved, whilst the rest of the meat belonged to the owners, therefore the thigh was forever called [the thigh of] “heaving,” and the breast that of “waving,” as was done to them on the day of [the priests] acquiring their rights to them.",
                    "AL ISHEI HACHALAVIM’ (UPON THE FIRE-OFFERINGS OF THE FAT). “This is like: ‘upon the fat of the fire-offerings.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">131</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the fats are burnt with fire they are called “the fats of the fire,” not “the fire of the fats.” This comment is found in Rashi’s text as quoted by Mizrachi and other commentators. It is not in our printed texts of Rashi.</i> From here we learn that at the time of waving the fat-portions were beneath.” This is the language of Rashi. But there is no need for it [i.e., to invert the verse, and to derive this law from the verse here]. For the word <i>ishei</i> (“fire-offerings of”) is an adjectival-noun qualifying the word <i>chalavim</i> (fats), just as He said, <i>‘ishei Hashem’</i> (<i>the fire-offerings of the Eternal</i>) <i>and His inheritance they</i> [the priests] <i>shall eat</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">132</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 18:1. — Ramban’s intent is as follows: Rashi had inverted the expression in the verse before us because since the fats are burned with fire, they are called “the fats of the fire,” and not “the fire-offerings of the fats” as the verse literally has it. But Ramban quotes the above-mentioned verse from Deuteronomy to show that the word <i>ishei</i> does not have its precise meaning of “the fires of,” since the priests do not eat that which has actually been on the fire upon the altar. The word <i>ishei</i> must therefore be taken as an adjectival-noun for all offerings, since most of them are put upon the fire. Consequently the fats are not called <i>ishei</i> because of the fire, and the expression in the verse need not be inverted. — Ramban now proceeds to comment on the second point that Rashi made, namely that from the verse here we learn that the fat-portions were at the bottom at the time of waving.</i> The explanation of this verse is that it constitutes a reason for that which He said [in the preceding verse], <i>for they</i> [the offerings] <i>are given as thy due, and thy sons’ due, out of the offerings of the peace-offerings of the children of Israel</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">133</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 14.</i> [With reference to this] He now said, <i>The thigh of heaving and the breast of waving shall they</i> — that is, the children of Israel, mentioned [in the previous verse] — <i>bring upon the fire-offerings of the fat, to wave it for a wave-offering before the Eternal</i>, that they [i.e., the thigh and the breast] be hallowed before Him, and they <i>shall be thine and thy sons’ with thee, as a due forever</i>.

This was felt necessary in order to convey the thought that uncleanness in the Biblical sense is not something that can be rubbed off with some material object. On the other hand, the terms “pure” and “impure” suggest a far greater measure of spirituality. The same comment applies equally to the following portions of the Torah — <i>Tazria, Metzora</i>, etc.</i> thus they must instruct Israel concerning the impure and the pure so that they can be careful of them. It was for this reason that the communication about these laws came to both Moses and Aaron, or to Moses to say to Aaron, commanding both of them, <i>speak unto the children of Israel</i>, and this is the reason why these laws were said in the Book of the Laws of the Priests [i.e., this Book of Leviticus].

Rather, when they said that there is no negative commandment against eating them, they meant to say that you cannot exclude them on the basis of it [i.e., on the basis of a <i>specific</i> Scriptural verse], and they are thus permitted. According to my opinion, however, this only applies to flesh [or blood] of a live person [which can not be prohibited on the basis of a definitive verse and hence if a person’s teeth are bleeding he may suck the blood thereof and not be afraid of having committed a sin].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">172</sup><i class=\"footnote\">However, if blood appears on the bread which he is eating he must first remove the blood stains from the bread before continuing to eat it in order to avoid the semblance of wrong-doing, since people might think that it is from the blood of an animal (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> However, the Rabbis have learned in connection with a corpse by means of an analogous use of words found when speaking of it and of the heifer whose neck is broken<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">173</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 21:4.</i> that it is forbidden to have any benefit from it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">174</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Abodah Zarah 29 b.

Perhaps the meaning of the interpretation which our Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">181</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rosh Hashanah 16 b.</i> “<i>And their carcasses ye shall not touch</i> — on a festival” is to say that “you should not touch them at a time when you want to be clean, for they are unclean [and by touching them you will also become unclean] and you will not be able to go up to the Sanctuary on the festival.” But the [mere] act of touching them is not forbidden by means of a negative commandment, for he who touches carrion [even] on a festival does not incur whipping [by law of the Torah]. Thus that which the Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">181</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rosh Hashanah 16 b.</i> “One is dutybound to purify oneself on a festival,” is a commandment of Rabbinic authority, there being according to Scriptural law neither a positive nor a negative commandment, concerning the touching of carrion, except that of going up to the Sanctuary.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">182</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 60-61.</i> Or it may be that the interpretation,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">181</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rosh Hashanah 16 b.</i> “<i>And their carcasses ye shall not touch</i> — on a festival,” is a Scriptural text used as a support for the Rabbinical enactment,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">80</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See in Exodus, <i>Seder Yithro</i>, p. 314, Note 449.</i> like many other laws of the Sages taught there in the Torath Kohanim, which use Biblical texts as a “support.” It is also taught there:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">183</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Shemini</i> 2:6.</i> “Other Rabbis<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">184</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to tradition, Rabbi Meir is quoted under this anonymous term <i>Acheirim</i> (others).

We must conclude that [touching a carcass] is optional” [i.e., neither obligatory, nor forbidden]. This is the main principle of the Scriptural law."

Rather, they are called “fixed” because they do not move to and fro from the fish, nor do they quiver as do the fins. They are the round coverings, the plates of which are like finger-nails, and they can be removed from the skin of the fish by hand or knife. But those [scales] which are fixed and attached to the skin of the fish and cannot be removed from the skin at all, are not <i>kaskeses</i> (scales), and the fish [which has them] is prohibited food. It is for this reason that the Sages in the Gemara<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">187</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 66 b. See in Exodus, <i>Seder Bo</i>, p. 132, for meaning of the word “Gemara.”</i> said that “<i>Kaskeses</i> is the cover of the fish.” In the words of the Tosephta:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">188</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tosephta Chullin 3:27. See above, Note 101 for meaning of the term “Tosephta.”</i> “The <i>kaskasim</i> are those [objects] which cover the fish, and the <i>snapirim</i> are those with which the fish moves.” This is also the translation of Onkelos, who rendered the word <i>kaskeses</i> as <i>klippin</i>, [which means literally “shells”], for they are the “shells” of the fish which can be taken off and peeled away like the bark of trees and the peel of fruits. Such is also the meaning of the verse stating, <i>and he</i> [Goliath] <i>was clad with a coat of ‘kaskasim’</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">189</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 17:5.</i> for all their [war-] coats were made of rings, and some people made “scales” in them in order to close up the openings of the rings, so that thin arrows should not be able to penetrate them, and it was those “scales” that were called <i>kaskasim</i>.

Understand this.<br>The reason why fins and scales [are signs of permissibility as food] is that those fish which have them always dwell in the upper clear waters, and they are sustained through the air that enters there. Therefore their bodies contain a certain amount of heat which counteracts the abundance of moistness [of the waters], just as wool, hair and nails function in man and beast. Those fish which have no fins and scales always dwell in the lower turbid waters, and due to the great abundance of moistness and gatherings of water there, they cannot repel anything. Hence they are creatures of cold fluid,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">193</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See in <i>Seder Vayikra</i>, Note 264.</i> which cleaves to them and is therefore more easily able to cause death, and it [the cold fluid] does in fact cause death in some waters, such as stagnant lakes."

Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote that <i>sheretz</i> (“swarming” things) are the small species that are born [and bred] in the waters, while “the living creatures” are the species of male and female. But in my opinion the term <i>‘sheretz’ that swarm in the waters</i> denotes the fish which swim in the waters, for every expression of <i>sheretz</i> means movement, and the term <i>all the living creatures that are in the waters</i>, refers to the sea-animals, some of which have legs which they walk upon like creatures of the field.

Shall we say that he meant to exclude red <i>yavchushim</i>? In that case even if the immersion-pool is full of them, it is also valid!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">204</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Resh Lakesh who used the expression <i>mashlim</i> (fill up), which implies merely a completion of measure by some addition, could therefore not have referred to these <i>yavchushim</i>, since even if the pool is composed entirely of them, it is also valid for immersion! — For Ramban’s intent in quoting this text, see further, Note 206.</i> For we are taught [in a Beraitha]: Rabban<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">205</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The title “Rabban” (“our Rabbi” — instead of “Rabbi”) indicates that the person was the <i>Nasi</i> (head) of the Sanhedrin.</i> Shimon the son of Gamaliel says: Whatever originates from water, one may immerse oneself therein [to be rendered ritually pure],” and red <i>yavchushim</i> is a species which originates from water [therefore Resh Lakesh could not have intended them, when he gave his rule excluding certain objects from being valid for <i>completing</i> the required measure of one fourth of a log for the washing of hands].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">206</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus it is clearly shown that <i>yavchushim</i> are found in water, and Rashi’s comment that <i>yavchushim</i> are those insects called [in old French] <i>mousclions</i> is therefore incorrect, since these germinate in wine, and in Hebrew they are called <i>yitushim</i>, while <i>yavchushim</i> germinate in water.</i> Similarly there are always found in the sediment of wine very white worms which are formed from the thickness of the wine, and which people filter, [and these are akin to the <i>mousclions</i> mentioned by Rashi].<br>Now I have seen in Rashi’s commentaries there [in Tractate Zebachim]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">202</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zebachim 22 a.</i> that he wrote: “Red <i>yavchushim</i>, these are a sort of wingless <i>yitushim</i> (mosquitoes) just like the small <i>yavchushim</i> which germinate at the bottom of our barrels of wine on the outside; and they are also formed in water.” Perhaps it is this wingless species [of insects] which can only be removed from water through a filtering process, that Rashi refers to here [in his commentary to the Torah, when referring to <i>yavchushim</i> as <i>mousclions</i>], since in his vernacular these water-insects were also called by that name [not only the ones produced in wine].

                    "AND THESE YE SHALL HAVE IN DETESTATION AMONG THE FOWLS. Of all fowls [existent], only those mentioned expressly in this section and their species — such as those concerning which it says, <i>after his kind</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">208</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 15.</i> or <i>after her kind</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">209</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 14.</i> — are prohibited, since Scripture did not mention any signs of unclean birds [by which we may know that they are] forbidden, or of clean birds [by which we may know that they are] permitted. Instead, it said, <i>And these ye shall have in detestation among the fowls</i> — [so that only those specifically mentioned are prohibited], and no others apart from these. Similarly, in connection with the swarming things which convey impurity, which Scripture mentioned in detail,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">210</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verses 29-30.</i> only those mentioned by name in the section are included in that law. Our Rabbis, however, have specified certain signs [of impurity as food] in birds, so that one may recognize through them that the fowls which lack those signs are not amongst those which are prohibited [here].<br>Now the most important sign [of unfitness as food] in fowls is preying, for every bird of prey<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">211</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to Rashi (Chullin 59 a) this means that the bird seizes its food from the ground in its claws, and eats it. Rabbeinu Tam explains it as meaning that it eats animals before they are dead. Ramban in his commentary (<i>ibid.</i>) interprets it as a bird of prey that kills by attacking with its claws. Further on in the text here Ramban will also elaborate on this characteristic.</i> is invariably unfit [as food]. The Torah removed it [from us] as food, because its blood becomes heated up due to its cruelty, and is dark and thick, which gives rise to that bitter [fluid in the body] which is mostly black<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">212</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See in <i>Seder Vayikra</i> Note 264.</i> and tends to make the heart cruel. There is not another fowl in the whole world that is a bird of prey apart from those mentioned in this section,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">213</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verses 13-19.</i> and therefore one may know that any fowl which is a bird of prey, is one of those mentioned here. Thus if it is known for sure that it does not prey, it may definitely be eaten, for amongst all the forbidden fowls, there is only one which does not prey, namely the bearded vulture or the osprey, and the Sages were not concerned about it [being eaten because of reliance on the fact that it does not prey], since it is not found in habitated places, but dwells always in wilderness. Perhaps it is because it dwells in wastelands and its blood is affected for the worse by the burning heat, like that of the birds of prey, that the Torah prohibited it as food together with them.<br>The Sages furthermore counted<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">186</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chullin 59 a.</i> amongst the signs [of fitness as food] that if a fowl be found which has an “extra” toe, and its crop and gizzard can be peeled, it is definitely fit [to be eaten], for the Sages knew that such a bird does not prey. But if it has only two of the three signs mentioned, we may not eat it; for the raven [which is a bird unfit as food, as stated in Verse 15], has an extra toe and a gizzard that can be peeled, and [therefore any bird that has only two signs of fitness] we suspect of being a raven or of its species, since they all have two tokens. It does not need to be said that if it has only one of the three signs mentioned we treat it as forbidden, for all the other forbidden fowls have one sign, except for the great vulture which has none of these three signs. Now the meaning of the term “preying” is that in hunting for food it chases after birds, catches them alive, presses on them with its claws and eats them, just as is done by the great hawk called <i>astur</i>, and the little hawk called <i>ashproir</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">214</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This term is mentioned by Rashi on the word <i>haneitz</i> (the hawk): <i>Espervier</i> in old French; in English, sparrow-hawk (see Rosenbaum-Silberman’s translation).</i> and in Arabic, <i>butz</i>. The above is the correct law of birds, as to which are forbidden food and which are permitted, and that which is the final result of the [discussions in the] Gemara, and is in accordance with that which we have searched and found to be so through the examination of birds.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">215</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his commentary to Tractate Chullin 62 b, Ramban relates that in order to ascertain the meaning of the Talmudic texts on the difficult subject of the signs of birds, he conducted a lengthy investigation into the characteristics of all kinds of birds, realizing that “we cannot deny things visible to the eyes.” This is the background of his concise statement here: “It is something we have searched etc.” Discussions he held with hunters were also a part of that investigation.</i><br>Thus the reason for certain birds being forbidden as food is on account of their cruel nature. It is also possible that the reason for certain animals [being forbidden] is similar, since no animal that chews the cud and has a parted hoof is a beast of prey, while the rest all devour others. There has also been found a difference in nature [between animals fit for food and those which are unfit], as the Sages have mentioned,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">216</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Abodah Zarah 38 b.</i> namely that all milks of animals fit for food, curdle, whereas all milks of those unfit for food, do not coagulate and cannot ever be made into cheese. Thus they are [physically] different. It is possible to say on the basis of this [difference in their natures, that those animals unfit for food] harm the procreative organs, so that the seed which gathers from their moisture is cold and extra-moist and will not beget at all, or not in the best and proper way, apart from the fact that there is a certain known benefit according to medical sciences [in eating those] animals that are permitted [by the Torah] as food. Now I have seen in some books of experiments<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">217</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Experiments.” Rabbeinu Bachya in quoting this passage of Ramban writes “Medicine” (in my edition, Vol. II, p. 461).</i> that if an infant drinks of the milk of a swine, that child will become a leper.

Hence he who eats forbidden winged swarming (or creeping) things transgresses a positive commandment, for which there is no punishment by the court. But in the Book of Deuteronomy, Ramban continues, there is also an express negative commandment against eating it. Hence he who eats it incurs whipping.</i> but in the Book of Deuteronomy there is a prohibition mentioned in connection with it, [namely], <i>And all ‘sheretz ha’oph’</i> (<i>winged creeping things</i>) <i>are unclean unto you; they shall not be eaten</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">224</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 14: 19.

Then He continues by stating that any beast which walks upon its paws shall also convey impurity until the evening to a person who touches its carcass, and that a person who <i>carries</i> it shall, in addition, wash his clothes.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">230</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verses 27 and 28.</i> Similarly, <i>And these are they which are unclean unto you among the swarming things</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">231</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 29.</i> means among those which are to be mentioned further on.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">232</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There in Verse 29 and in Verse 30: <i>the weasel, and the mouse</i> etc.</i> Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra erred here.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">233</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ibn Ezra explained the expression <i>and by those ye shall become unclean</i> (in Verse 24 before us) as referring to <i>sheretz ha’oph</i> (winged creeping things) and also to the fowls unfit for food as mentioned above in Scripture. But this is a mistake, since no impurity is conveyed by a fowl unfit for food, nor by a winged creeping thing unfit for food.</i><br>Now above, in stating the prohibition of eating [an animal prohibited as food], Scripture mentioned those animals which are not cloven-footed and do not chew the cud, but it did not mention [the law] of beasts that walk upon their paws. Perhaps it is because it is not customary to eat them [on account of the danger involved in catching them] that He did not single them out, but left them [to be] included in the general principle which He had stated, that we should eat only the animal that parts the hoof and is cloven-footed and chews the cud, and not others, and <i>chayah</i> (beast) is included in the term <i>beheimah</i> (animal) as it is said, <i>These are ‘ha’beheimah’</i> (<i>the animals</i>) <i>which ye may eat … the hart, and the gazelle, and the roebuck</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">234</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 14:4-5. Scripture begins here with <i>beheimah</i> and goes on to enumerate <i>chayah</i> (beasts).</i> Our Rabbis in the Torath Kohanim have interpretations on this whole section.

                    "HE SHALL BE UNCLEAN UNTIL THE EVEN. The meaning of this expression in the whole section is that at night he becomes pure, if he had bathed his flesh in water [before sundown]. Scripture, however, speaks briefly [and therefore omitted] the bathing of the body, because it mentioned the washing of clothes of the one who <i>carries</i> anything unclean,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">236</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 25.</i> which means their immersion [in a ritual pool], and it follows all the more so that he must bathe his body. Then when Scripture finished mentioning all the impurities [conveyed by] carcasses and [dead] creeping things, it mentioned immersion [for those vessels which became impure through touching them]: <i>it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; then shall it be clean</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">237</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 32.</i> the same law applying to man, for it is from here that the principle is derived.

The matter of bathing [in the case of impurity conveyed by] creeping things has already been mentioned here, as I have written. Now Scripture was more severe in the case of a person who carries an impure object than in the case of a person who touches it, in requiring the bearer to wash his clothes, [but not one who only touches it], because it is natural that a person who touches does so with his hand lightly, while he who carries as a burden [does so in such a way] that it presses upon him, and in the majority of cases his clothes help him [in carrying]."

Thus according to the interpretation of the Rabbis, Verse 32 before us also speaks only of the impurity conveyed by creeping things, and not, as explained above, about all other impurities.</i> Scripture dealt likewise with the subject of immersion, in mentioning at the end of all [the laws of] impurity, the impurity [conveyed by creeping things] to vessels and their purification by immersion,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">244</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verses 34-36.</i> and from it we learn the law of man and vessels with reference to all the impurities mentioned above.",

But the law regarding it is less stringent than that which applies to <i>terumah</i> (the heave-offering) eaten by the priest. Thus if an Israelite who was impure immersed himself to be purified, he may straightaway eat of the Second Tithe, even though the sun has not yet set. But a priest who was impure and immersed himself before sunset, may not eat of the heave-offering until the sun has set and the stars have come forth.</i> when it is still daytime [immediately after it was immersed to be purified], but regarding the heave-offering it is not held to be pure until it becomes dark.” The interpretation of the verse according to the explanation of the Torath Kohanim is thus: “it must be put into the water [before sundown] and it shall remain unclean till the evening.” But by way of the simple meaning of Scripture [the verse is to be transposed, thus]: “it must be put into water and it shall be clean, but it shall be unclean until the evening.”<br>Now Scripture mentioned in all the sections [that the impurity is] “until the evening,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">247</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verses 24-25, 27-28, 31-32.</i> because it refers to the degree of purity required for the holy heave-offering, as He said, <i>The soul that toucheth any such</i> [unclean things] <i>shall be unclean until the even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he bathe his flesh in water.

                    "OF ALL THE FOOD WHICH MAY BE EATEN, THAT ON WHICH WATER COMETH, SHALL BE UNCLEAN. Rashi commented: “This verse according to its [Rabbinical] interpretations teaches many things. We learn that food does not become fit to be susceptible of impurity until water has once come upon it, and once water has come upon it, it can subsequently at any time become impure, even after it has become dry, etc. Our Rabbis have further learned from this verse that ‘a secondary impurity’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">252</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Or as generally also referred to “a first degree of impurity.” Reference here is to a person or vessel that touched one of the eight dead creeping things enumerated in Verses 29-30, which are considered “fathers of impurity.” The person or vessel that touched them become “a first degree of impurity.” There are many “fathers of impurity.” Thus the carrier of those animals that are unfit for food, or of those which are fit for food but have not been slaughtered in the proper ritual manner, mentioned above in this section, also belong to this category [[illegible]] “a first degree of impurity.” Now “fathers of impurity” can convey impurity to people and vessels, whereas “a first degree of impurity” can only convey impurity to foodstuffs and liquids.</i> does not render vessels impure, for so we are taught etc. Again we learn that the coming of water upon vegetation makes it susceptible to impurity only after it has been plucked from the soil etc.” And included among the principles [we learn from this verse], Rashi said: “And we further learn that impure foodstuff does not convey impurity to other objects unless it [the former] consists of at least the size of an egg, for it says, <i>of all the food which may be eaten</i>, which means food which can be eaten in one gulp, and the Sages calculated that the esophagus does not hold more than a hen’s egg.” This is the language of the Rabbi [Rashi.].<br>But there is [too great a] brevity in Rashi’s comment. For this verse speaks about foodstuff itself becoming impure, and does not refer to its <i>conveying</i> impurity to others. The Rabbi [Rashi], however, derived this principle from what the Rabbis have said in the Torath Kohanim:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">253</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Shemini</i> 9:1.</i> “<i>Of all the food</i> etc. <i>shall be unclean</i>. This teaches that food [upon which a dead creeping thing falls], is rendered impure even if it be of the smallest quantity. Now I might think that it can also <i>convey</i> impurity to other objects if the [original] impure food was of the smallest quantity; Scripture therefore says, <i>which may be eaten</i>. Thus you learn that it cannot render other things impure unless it is itself the size of an egg.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">254</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, it was on the basis of this Torath Kohanim that Rashi interpreted the expression in the verse here, <i>of all food which may be eaten</i> as applying to “impure” food <i>conveying</i> impurity to others, the verse teaching us that the conveyor of the impurity must be of the size <i>which may be eaten</i>, which is, as explained above, the size of an egg. The verse could not refer to the original foodstuff itself becoming impure because of having touched a dead creeping thing [or any “father of impurity” — see above Note 251], for in that case even the smallest quantity of food suffices to be rendered impure. — But, Ramban continues, other scholars have already differed with Rashi on this point, bringing proof etc. (see text).</i> But other authorities have already differed<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">255</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tosafoth Shabbath 91 a.</i> with the Rabbi [Rashi], and they brought proofs that by Scriptural law foodstuffs do not [even] <i>become</i> impure at all unless they are of the size of an egg.

The meaning thereof is as follows: “but waters which touch the carcass [of any of the creeping things] shall become impure, [meaning that waters which are <i>separated</i> [from a gathering of water] are rendered impure if they touch their carcass. [The phrase, <i>and</i> [<i>waters</i>] <i>which touch their carcass shall be unclean</i>, must be referring to detached waters], for when the waters are still attached to the pool, they cannot [be said to] ‘touch’ their carcass, but rather [Scripture should have said], their carcass ‘fell’ into it.” Scripture speaks of water in the singular [saying, <i>v’nogeia</i> — “and that which toucheth”], just as it says elsewhere, <i>the water of sprinkling was not sprinkled upon him</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">261</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 19:13.

This includes a case where she gave birth to [the male child as] a fleshy mass which had dissolved, so that it became liquefied and like seed, in which case his mother becomes impure because of the birth” [as if it were a normal child]. The explanation of this matter<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban is clarifying Rashi’s words and saying that Rashi did not refer to a case where the abortion was a foetus filled with water, for in that event the mother does not become impure for the days prescribed for a male or for a female child. Rather, Rashi referred to a case where the child had been formed already etc.</i> is that we know that the child has been formed already in human form, and then became liquefied, for anything that does not have a human form is not considered a child, and similarly, whatever is not fit to become a creature with a soul, is not considered a child. But even if it is a fleshy dissolved mass at the time of birth, it makes the mother impure [for the prescribed number of days] provided we recognize its form, such as a foetus with its human parts fashioned, in which case the mother is certainly impure, and if not [i.e., the matter is in doubt] she is impure because of a doubt. This is what this verse comes to include according to the words of our Rabbis.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Niddah 27b.</i><br>Now with regard to the implication of the verse the Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 31a.</i> “<i>Ishah ki thazria</i> —<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “if the woman has [an emission of] seed” first. — Then, as the verse continues, she will bear a male-child.</i> if the woman emits seed first, she will bear a son.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“And when the male is the first to emit semen, then she will bear a female-child.”</i> The intent of the Rabbis was not that the child is formed from the woman’s seed, for although the woman has generative organs [i.e., ovaries] like those of the man, yet seed is not formed by them at all, or [if it is formed], that seed is not thick and does not contribute anything to the embryo. Rather, the Rabbis used the term “she emits seed” with reference to the blood of the womb, which gathers in the mother at the time of the consummation of coition, and attaches itself to the seed of the male. For in the opinion of the Rabbis the child is formed from the blood of the female and the white [semen] of the man, and both of them are called “seed.” Thus the Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 31a.</i> “There are three partners in [the formation of] man: The male emits the white [semen], from which are formed the sinews, the bones, and the white substance in the eye. The female emits a red secretion from which are formed the skin, the flesh, the blood, the hair, and the black substance in the eye.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“And the Holy One, blessed be He [i.e., the third partner in the formation of the child] gives him spirit and soul, beauty of features, power of sight, power of hearing, speech and walk, and understanding and rational faculty” (Niddah 31 a).</i> The opinion of doctors as to the formation [of the embryo of the child] is also the same. In the opinion of the Greek philosophers,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Vol. I, p. 76 (in Verse 18) where Ramban alludes to this controversy.</i> however, the whole body of the child is formed from [the substance of] the blood of the mother, the father only contributing that generative force which is known in their language as <i>hyly</i>, which gives form to matter.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>ibid.</i>, p. 23.</i> For there is no difference at all between the egg of a chicken which is laid because it was fructified by a male, and that laid as a result of the mother rolling herself in the dust, except that the egg [that had been fructified by a male] germinates into a young bird, while the other is <i>not sown, nor beareth</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 29:22. The thought here suggested is: “because the seed of the male was lacking, therefore it does not bear.”</i> because it is deprived of the elemental heat which is its <i>hyly</i>. And if so, the word <i>tazria</i> [in <i>ishah ki thazria</i>] will be like <i>u’cheganah zeiru’eha thatzmiach</i> (<i>as the garden causeth the seeds that are sown in it to spring forth</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 61:11. — Ramban’s meaning is as follows: According to the view of the Rabbis [and the doctors] that the child is formed both by the seed of man and the secretion of woman, the expression <i>ishah ki thazria</i> can be understood in its simple meaning: “when the female emits her secretion” first etc. But according to the philosophers who say that the child is formed entirely from the body of the mother, and the male semen is merely a generative force which gives form to matter, then the word <i>tazria</i> can no longer mean “emitting,” but is like <i>thatzmiach</i> — “causes to spring up.”</i> And so did Onkelos render it: “If a woman conceives.”",

But I do not know on the basis of which root the word <i>d’vothah</i> can be an expression in the Sacred Language for “anything which flows.” But it is possible that it is an expression of malady, on the basis of what the Rabbis have said,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Niddah 9 a.</i> “and her head and limbs are heavy on her.” So also is the opinion of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra, who writes: “<i>D’vothah</i> is a noun and means sickness, for the blood which issues indicates a sickness in the woman.” Now it is true that the flow constitutes a cleansing of surpluses [of blood], and due to the fact that her head and her limbs feel heavy upon her, the flow is perhaps termed “a sickness.” The correct interpretation, however, is that <i>d’vothah</i> is an expression derived from the word <i>madveh</i> [which does not mean “sickness,” i.e., an unnatural occurrence in the body, since a woman’s menses are natural; and <i>d’vothah</i> is therefore like the terms] plague and pain, just as in the expressions: <i>My heart is ‘davoi’</i> (<i>faint</i>) <i>within me;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 8:18.</i> <i>for this our heart is ‘daveh’</i> (<i>faint</i>),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lamentations 5:17.</i> and like: <i>the plague of his heart</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Kings 8:38.</i> Thus menstruation is an affliction upon the woman even though it is in her nature [to experience it regularly].

For a female child the number of impure days are fourteen, and the waiting period until she may eat of the offerings etc. is sixty-six days, and she brings her offerings on the eighty-first day. — It should be pointed out that this is the <i>Scriptural</i> law which explains the verses and the text of Ramban before us. For the practical law to be observed today, see further, Note 23.</i> this being the sense of the expression <i>in the blood of purification</i>. Scripture uses this expression [<i>‘remain’ in the blood of purification</i>, instead of saying “and she shall then be … “] in order to inform us that even though she sees no issue of blood during these [thirty-three days for a male child, or sixty-six for a female], she must still wait this entire period on account of the childbirth [before she may eat of the hallowed food or enter the Sanctuary]. It is possible that the expression <i>teisheiv</i> here is like in the verse, <i>Many days ‘teishvi’</i> (<i>thou shalt sit solitary</i>) <i>for me; thou shalt not play the harlot, and then thou shalt not be any man’s wife</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hosea 3:3.</i> for a woman who has intercourse with her husband is called <i>yosheveth lo</i> (sitting for him).

Rabbi Moshe Isserless states the law as it is to be observed today. After commenting that in some places it is customary that during the entire forty-days period for a male-child and eighty for a female, the mother does not purify herself for her husband by immersion in a ritual pool, he states the law to be as follows: “But in those places where there is no such custom, we should not be stringent at all. Rather, immediately after she has not seen blood following the seven-days for a male-child and fourteen for a female, and after she counted a further seven <i>clean</i> days, she is permitted to her husband. But if she again saw even a drop of blood as tiny as a grain of mustard, she is unclean. For although by Scriptural law it is clean blood, yet the custom has already been accepted in all Israel that no coition is permitted if there is clean blood, the law applicable thereto being in every respect like that of other [unclean] blood” (Yoreh Deah 194:1, Rama).</i><br>The correct interpretation appears to me to be that a woman in the days of her menstruation is called <i>niddah</i> (shunned) because she was avoided by and kept distant from all people. Men and women would not approach her, and she would sit alone and not speak with them, for even her speech was considered by them impure, and they regarded the dust upon which she stepped to be impure as the dust of the decomposed bones of the dead. Our Rabbis have mentioned this.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Vol. I, p. 387.</i> Even her gaze was considered harmful, and I have already mentioned this in <i>Seder Vayeitzei Ya’akov</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, pp. 387-388, and Note 224 there.</i> Thus it was the custom of menstruants to sit in a special tent, this being the intent of Rachel’s words to her father [Laban], <i>Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise up before thee; for the manner of women is upon me</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 31:35.</i> since it was their custom that a woman in that condition should not walk, nor let the sole of her foot step upon the ground. That is why the Torah was more stringent in regard to what the menstruant sits upon or lies upon [in that both the person who touches them and his garments are rendered impure]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 15:21-23.</i> than with respect to touching [the menstruant herself, in which case the person himself is rendered impure, but not his garments].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 19.</i> Similarly Scripture said in regard to the leper: <i>he shall dwell</i> [literally: “sit”] <i>alone; without the camp shall his dwelling be</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 13:46.</i> and it did not say as it did in the case of the other impure persons, <i>and he shall go out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 23:11.</i> Rather, it mentioned the term “sitting,” meaning that he is to avoid walking, since his odor and breath are harmful. It is for this reason that Scripture says here that for another thirty-three days <i>she shall ‘sit’ in the blood of purification</i>, in the same place where she sat in the [seven] days of impurity on account of the childbirth, and further prohibited by means of a negative commandment from touching hallowed things or coming into the Sanctuary during that time. The [Rabbinical] interpretation thereof is as follows:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifra, <i>Tazria</i> 1:7.</i> “<i>She shall continue</i> [in the blood of purification for three and thirty days]. This comes to include a woman in hard labor during the eleven days,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is important to clarify first certain basic <i>Scriptural</i> concepts in order to understand the text before us: (a) Commencing with the day on which a woman first sees a menstrual issue, she is to count seven days of impurity. During these days she remains impure, and forbidden to her husband, whether or not she sees another issue in the course of them. The issue, however, having ceased before the sun has set on the seventh day, she is to immerse herself that night in a ritual pool and may enter into conjugal relations. [However, for the Rabbinic ordinance as observed today, see Note 35.] (b) After these seven days of impurity effecting the menstruant, commences “the eleven-day period” (here referred to in the text) during which she becomes subject to the law affecting the <i>zavah</i> (a woman suffering a flux outside her regular period). That is to say, if during this period she sees one or two issues on the same day or on two consecutive days, she only has to immerse herself in a ritual pool on the following day, and returns to her purity with the setting of the sun. A woman suffering a flux of this kind is often referred to as “a minor <i>zavah</i>.” If, however, during the eleven-day period she sees one or more issues on three consecutive days, she becomes “a major <i>zavah</i>,” being under the obligation to count seven “clean days” after the complete cessation of the flux. And if in the course of these seven “clean days,” she sees another issue, she is to commence counting seven “clean days” anew. With the completion of the counting of seven completely “clean days,” the major <i>zavah</i> is to immerse herself in a ritual pool, bringing on the following day the prescribed offering (further, 15:29-30). Thus it is clear that by ordinance of the Torah, the law of the menstruant is far different from that of the <i>zavah</i>, to which she is subject during “the eleven-day” period, or the intervening time between her regular periods. See additionally, Note 35 as to the Rabbinic ordinance.</i> that she be pure from <i>zivah</i> (the law of ‘flux’).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus a woman who was in protracted labor for <i>three</i> days of this “eleven-day period” [during which ordinarily the laws of <i>zivah</i> would have applied], and she saw issues on these three consecutive days, is yet <i>not</i> subject to this law. But, as the text continues, if she was in hard labor during her seven days of menstruation and she saw an issue, she is impure as a menstruant.</i> I might think that she should also be regarded as pure from [the impurity conveyed through] menstruation;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See above, Note 32 (a).</i> Scripture therefore says [<i>as in the days of the impurity of her sickness</i>] <i>shall she be unclean</i>.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is important to note that by Rabbinic ordinance a woman seeing an issue <i>at any time whatever</i>, is under obligation to count seven completely “clean days” after the cessation of the issue last seen — irrespective of whether she has seen the last issue within the seven-day period, or at any time thereafter. She must then immerse herself in a ritual pool, whereupon she is considered purified, and may enter into conjugal relations — the conditions attaching to the eating of hallowed food no longer of course being in force in our days because of the destruction of the Sanctuary and the absence of certain other means of ritual purification.</i>",
                    "IN THE BLOOD OF ‘TAHORAH’ (PURIFICATION). According to Rashi this means that even though she sees [an issue of blood during this period of thirty-three days for a male child, and sixty-six for a female], she is nevertheless pure by law of the Torah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This as noted above is the Scriptural law. Rabbi Moshe Isserless states the law as it is to be observed today. After commenting that in some places it is customary that during the entire forty-days period for a male-child and eighty for a female, the mother does not purify herself for her husband by immersion in a ritual pool, he states the law to be as follows: “But in those places where there is no such custom, we should not be stringent at all. Rather, immediately after she has not seen blood following the seven-days for a male-child and fourteen for a female, and after she counted a further seven <i>clean</i> days, she is permitted to her husband. But if she again saw even a drop of blood as tiny as a grain of mustard, she is unclean. For although by Scriptural law it is clean blood, yet the custom has already been accepted in all Israel that no coition is permitted if there is clean blood, the law applicable thereto being in every respect like that of other [unclean] blood” (Yoreh Deah 194:1, Rama).</i> And so did Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra write, that the meaning of the above expression is that “it constitutes pure blood in contrast to the blood of the menstruant, and therefore does not convey impurity, G-d having decreed in the case of a male child [a forty-days period for the after-effects of the childbirth upon the mother — seven impure days and thirty-three pure days], corresponding to the number of days necessary for the form of the male child to be completed in the womb, while that of the female child is double [fourteen impure days and sixty-six pure days, corresponding to the eighty days it takes for the female child to be formed in the mother’s womb]. This is clear and tested.”<br>But in my opinion the meaning of the word <i>tahorah</i> is cleanness [in a physical sense], similar in meaning to <i>‘zahav tahor’</i> (<i>pure gold</i>),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 25:39.</i> which means smelted and refined. A similar expression is found in the verse, <i>And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Malachi 3:3.</i> Thus the meaning of the expression here is as follows. Having commanded that a woman who gives birth to a male child be impure for seven days <i>as in the days of her impurity</i>, because then she usually sees issues of blood from the interior of the womb [from which the menses are discharged], He further commanded that she should wait for another thirty-three days, staying in her house in order to cleanse her body; for during all these days she will emit the remnants of blood and the turbid, ill-smelling secretions which come from these bloods, and then she will become cleansed <i>from the childbirth, pregnancy and conception</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Hosea 9:11.</i> and she may come to the House of G-d. Now our Rabbis have received the tradition that during these [thirty-three days for a male child and sixty-six for a female], she is pure for her husband, because with reference to the seven impure days it says that they are <i>as in the days of the impurity of her sickness</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 2.</i> but in connection with these [thirty-three days etc.] He said that she is impure as regards [eating or touching] hallowed things and entering the Sanctuary, but not for non-holy things nor for her husband, just as the Rabbis have said,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chullin 31 a.</i> “Her husband is not a holy object.”<br>The reason that the time is doubled in the case of the birth of a female child [i.e., fourteen impure days and sixty-six pure days], is perhaps as Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra said [as mentioned above] in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael, that the formation of a male child is completed on the forty-first day, and that of a female child on the eighty-first day. But according to the opinion of the Sages who say that both male and female are completed on the forty-first day, we must say that the reason [why the time is doubled in the case of a female child] is that the nature of the female is cold and moist, and the white [fluid] in the mother’s womb is then exceedingly abundant and cold, this being the reason why she gave birth to a female child. Hence she needs a longer time to become clean [in a physical sense], on account of the abundant moisture in her which contains the ill-smelling blood, and on account of the coldness [of her body], as is well-known that sick people who suffer from cold need a longer period to restore their vigor than those who are hot."

In the section dealing with a person suffering from an issue it does say, <i>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 15:2.</i> because since the matter is of an intimate nature, unknown to others, He admonished them that they should each inform the priest of their sickness.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In view of the fact that decisions of purity and impurity in cases where a man or woman saw a flux was <i>not</i> dependent upon the pronouncement of the priest, unlike the law in cases of leprosy (see Note 46 above), Ramban’s words must be understood in the following sense: Since the priest has occasion to perform the Service in the Sanctuary, and even when he is outside it, he may eat <i>terumah</i> (the heave-offering), which he is forbidden to eat when impure, therefore the Israelite who is suffering from a flux and thus rendered impure must let the priest know of his condition, so that he should not be defiled on account of him.

Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote that “<i>se’eith</i> is a term for ‘burning,’ the word being associated with the expressions: <i>‘v’hamaseith’</i> (<i>and the beacon</i>) <i>began to arise up;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Judges 20:40.</i> <i>‘va’yisa’eim’</i> (<i>and</i>) <i>David</i> (<i>burned them</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Samuel 5:21.</i> It is possible that it is called <i>se’eith</i> [literally: ‘uprising,’ ‘swelling’], because it is in the nature of fire to rise upwards. <i>Sapachath</i> is of the root: <i>‘sphacheini’</i> (<i>attach me</i>), <i>I pray;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 2:36.</i> <i>‘v’nispechu’</i> (<i>and they shall cleave</i>) <i>to the house of Jacob</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 14:1.</i> — signifying a sickness which attaches to one place. <i>Bahereth</i> is of the root, <i>‘bahir’</i> (<i>bright</i>) <i>in the skies</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 37:21.</i> becoming a sort of sign or mark.” [Thus far is Ibn Ezra’s interpretation.] If so, the term <i>se’eith</i> is the name of the plague caused by the bitter green burning fluid [in the body],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See in <i>Seder Vayikra</i> Note 264.</i> and <i>bahereth</i> is caused by the white fluid, and <i>sapachath</i> is brought about by a combination of both of these fluids.

                    "AND THE APPEARANCE OF THE PLAGUE BE DEEPER THAN THE SKIN OF THE FLESH. “Every white color appears deep [in contrast to the darker color surrounding it], just as a color illuminated by the sun appears deeper than the shadow.” This is Rashi’s language. For this reason when the Rabbi [Rashi] reached the following verse, stating, <i>And if the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 4. At this point it is necessary to explain some of the basic principles on which the following discussions of Ramban in this whole section of <i>Tazria</i> are based: (a) Any of the four colors of white (see Note 105) which appears <i>in the skin of the flesh</i>, does not of itself render the person impure, unless in addition it has one of the three symptoms of impurity, which are: if the plague has turned a minimum of two black hairs in the white patch in the flesh to white, or some “quick flesh” has appeared in the middle of the plague, or, if not having had one of these symptoms to begin with, the person was shut up for seven days, and then it was seen that the white patch of the plague had spread in the skin. (b) If any of these four colors appear in a place where there was an inflammation or a burning inflammation, the person is rendered impure only by means of one of these two symptoms: hair changing color from black to white, or the spreading of the white patch of the plague in the skin. The appearance of “quick flesh” in this case is <i>not</i> a sign of impurity. (c) If a plague appears in the hair, the symptoms of impurity are one of two: if the plague has caused a minimum of two hairs to turn gold-colored, or if it has spread in the skin. (d) A special lengthy discussion appears in Ramban (further in Verse 29) as to the precise nature of the plague which the Torah calls <i>nethek</i> (Verse 30), and which laws regulate it. Other laws pertinent to these discussions are clearly set forth in the text. Finally, it should be noted that a person shut up or quarantined for a week by the priest is rendered unclean in every respect as a leper that is certified unclean, except that he need not go with unkempt hair and rent garments; also, if declared “clean” by the priest at the end of the week he need not do the cutting off of the hair and the bringing of the bird-offerings etc., as they are required of the leper that had been certified unclean when healed of his leprosy (see further Chapter 14) (Megillah 8 b).</i> he wrote, “I do not know the meaning of this.” The sense of Rashi’s statement is as follows: It appeared to him difficult, for since the bright spot is white, it is impossible that the appearance thereof should <i>not</i> be deeper than the skin, even as the color of anything illuminated by the sun appears deeper than the shadow!<br>Now we are in a position to remove this difficulty. For the verses do not speak of the appearance of a plague seeming deeper than the skin, unless two hairs in the plague become white [such being the case in Verse 3 before us]. But when it states [as it does in the following verse], <i>and the hair thereof be not turned white</i>, it says, <i>and the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 4. At this point it is necessary to explain some of the basic principles on which the following discussions of Ramban in this whole section of <i>Tazria</i> are based: (a) Any of the four colors of white (see Note 105) which appears <i>in the skin of the flesh</i>, does not of itself render the person impure, unless in addition it has one of the three symptoms of impurity, which are: if the plague has turned a minimum of two black hairs in the white patch in the flesh to white, or some “quick flesh” has appeared in the middle of the plague, or, if not having had one of these symptoms to begin with, the person was shut up for seven days, and then it was seen that the white patch of the plague had spread in the skin.

Now hair in its natural state is dark, and therefore destroys the appearance of depth of the plague. When the hairs in the plague have turned white or yellow,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 30.</i> then only does the whiteness of the plague shine brightly, and appears to anyone who looks at it from a distance as if it were deeper [than the skin of the flesh].<br>Yet despite all this, that which the Rabbi [Rashi] has said — “Every white color is deeper [in contrast to dark colors surrounding it]” — does not appear to me to be correct. For the Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shebuoth 6 b.</i> “The word <i>se’eith</i> is always an expression of ‘rising,’” and the <i>se’eith</i> is white, as it is written, <i>‘se’eith l’vanah’</i> (<i>a white rising</i>),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 10.</i> and the Rabbis have further said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">64</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shebuoth 5 b.</i> “<i>Se’eith</i> is [as white] as white wool, and its second [subsidiary] shade is as white as the membrane of an egg.” Thus <i>se’eith</i> is very white, and [according to Rashi] it should appear very deep, so why then do the Rabbis call it “rising?” Scripture also does not state anywhere concerning the color of <i>se’eith</i> that it is deeper than the skin!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further in Verses 19-20 Scripture states: <i>And in the place of the boil there is ‘se’eith l’vanah’</i> (<i>a white rising</i>) <i>or ‘bahereth’</i> (<i>a bright spot</i>) <i>… and the priest shall look; and behold, if the appearance thereof be ‘shaphal’</i> (<i>lower</i>) <i>than the skin</i>. Now the word <i>shaphal</i> (lower) refers obviously to both <i>se’eith</i> and <i>bahereth</i> mentioned before. But according to Rashi, Ramban asks, why does it not state concerning the color of <i>se’eith</i> that it is <i>‘amok min ha’or’</i> (“deeper” than the skin) instead of “lower” than the skin, when, as Rashi put it, “Every white color is ‘deeper’ [in contrast to the black surrounding it]?” And here too (in Verse 3 before us) it merely says that <i>the appearance of ‘the plague’ be deeper</i>, but it does not say so about the <i>se’eith</i>!</i> And in the Torah Kohanim the Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim <i>Tazria</i>, Negaim 1:4.</i> “What is the meaning of the term <i>se’eith?</i> It is ‘rising,’ just as the color of the shadow is <i>higher</i> than that of anything illuminated by the sun.” And if every white color is deep [in contrast to a dark color surrounding it, as Rashi put it], then the fact is the opposite [of what the Rabbis have said in the Torath Kohanim]! Perhaps we may say that the terms <i>se’eith</i> signifies “rising” in contrast to <i>bahereth</i>, so that if you place both of them together, the <i>bahereth</i> will appear as if illuminated by the sun, and the <i>se’eith</i> at its side will have the appearance of the shadow, while both of them in relation to the skin [which is darker] will appear as deeper.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">67</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus we have explained the saying of the Rabbis that <i>se’eith</i> signifies “rising,” for it is only in contrast to <i>bahereth</i> which is bright-white like snow, that the duller color of <i>se’eith</i> appears “higher.” Thus there is no contradiction between this statement of the Rabbis and that which Rashi said, that “Every white color is deep etc.,” since the above interpretation of the Rabbis concerning <i>se’eith</i> was with reference to a contrast of a still brighter color. It still remains to explain why Scripture does not speak of <i>se’eith</i> as appearing “deeper” than the skin, but instead speaks of it as being “lower” than the skin (see Note 65 above). This point Ramban will now proceed to explain.</i> Yet Scripture [nonetheless] does not speak of the color of <i>se’eith</i> as being deeper than the skin!<br>The explanation of this matter appears to me to be as follows. There is a kind of white which shines into and dazzles the eyes just as the appearance of the sun does, with the result that the eyes are incapable of receiving the intense color of that whiteness, and therefore it seems to him [a person looking] as if it were deep, just as the color illuminated by the sun appears deeper than the shadow, because the eye can receive the darker color and it is fixed thereon, whereas the white color scatters the visionary power and appears further removed from it, and therefore seems to be deep. Thus the whiteness of <i>bahereth</i> which is a bright white like snow,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Negaim 1:1.</i> causes the visionary power to be weakened, just as it becomes weak in a place illuminated by the sun, provided that there is no black hair in the <i>bahereth</i>, in which case the visionary power concentrates on the black and from there it spreads out to the whole appearance of the plague and does not “flee” from it [on account of its intense whiteness, and therefore it does not appear to be deeper than the skin].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This explains Verse 4 which states: <i>And if the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin</i> — on which Rashi had commented, “I do not know the meaning of this,” for the reason explained above. Ramban explains it on the basis of physical laws of nature, that since the verse continues to state, <i>and the hair thereof be not turned white</i>, therefore the visionary power of the eye concentrates on the black hair, and from there it spreads forth to the white plague, and consequently the whiteness does not appear deeper than the skin.</i> Now the plague known as <i>se’eith</i> is also white, but its whiteness is not intense [as that of <i>bahereth</i>]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The color of <i>se’eith</i>, as mentioned above, is as white as white wool.</i> and it does not weaken the visionary power; therefore the eye spreads out [over the whole plague] and sees it closely with the result that the <i>se’eith</i> appears near to it and elevated, just as when one looks at the stars which appear to be high in the heavens.<br>Now in the case of an inflammation [in the skin, in which symptoms of leprosy occurred], Scripture mentions two colors, <i>a white ‘se’eith’</i> (<i>rising</i>) <i>or a white ‘bahereth’</i> (<i>bright spot</i>)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 19.</i> intermingled with red, and states concerning it, <i>behold, it be in sight ‘lower’ than the skin</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">72</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 20. At this point Ramban interprets the phrase quoted as referring back to both <i>se’eith</i> and <i>bahereth</i>. Further on he will explain it as referring only to <i>bahereth</i>. See further, Note 73.</i> but does not say “deeper” [than the skin], because although that <i>bahereth</i> is an intense white, the redness in it lessens the “depth” thereof and makes it appear only slightly “lower” [than the skin].<br>But by way of the plain meaning of Scripture the phrase <i>behold, it be in sight ‘lower’ than the skin</i> only refers back to the <i>bahereth</i>, but of <i>the white se’eith’</i> (<i>rising</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 19.</i> it does not say so.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">73</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For since Ramban has explained above that it is <i>not</i> in the nature of every form of white to appear deeper than the skin [unlike Rashi who stated categorically, “Every white color is deep etc.,” as a result of which Rashi found it difficult to explain the phrase in Verse 4: <i>and the appearance thereof be ‘not’ deeper than the skin</i>, as mentioned above] and since <i>se’eith</i> is only as white as white wool, unlike the <i>bahereth</i> which is bright-white like snow, therefore Scripture does not speak of it as appearing “lower” than the skin. Instead, the phrase, <i>behold, it be in sight ‘lower’ than the skin</i> (Verse 20) refers back only to the white <i>bahereth</i>. It is only according to Rashi who wrote that “Every white color appears deeper etc.” that the phrase in Verse 20, <i>behold, it be in sight ‘lower’</i> etc. refers back to both <i>se’eith</i> and <i>bahereth</i> mentioned in Verse 19.</i> And concerning both of them [<i>se’eith</i> and <i>bahereth</i>] Scripture says [in the case of an inflammation in the skin], <i>But behold, if there be no white hairs therein, and it be not lower than the skin, but be dim</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">74</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 21.</i> for on account of the redness [which is intermingled in the white], and the blackness of the hair, the plague has lost even its appearance of being “lower” [than the skin] and is only “dim.”<br>In the case of a burning by fire Scripture mentions, <i>and the quick flesh of the burnt part have a white ‘bahereth’</i> (<i>bright spot</i>), <i>reddish-white or white</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">75</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 24.</i> and then it continues [in the following verse] to state, <i>and it be in sight ‘deeper’ than the skin;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">76</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 25.</i> [that refers back only] to “the white” [in the preceding verse, but not to the reddish-white, which, as explained above, does not appear to be “deeper” than the skin]. Then it states further on, <i>But if the priest look on it, and behold, there be no white hair in the ‘bahereth’</i> (<i>bright spot</i>), <i>and it be no lower than the skin</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">77</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 26.</i> In this case He mentioned the matter of being “lower” or not with reference [also] to “the reddish-white” [in Verse 24], thus teaching that the appearance of the plague either as “deep” or “low” is an indication of impurity, and that they are only pure if there is no appearance at all [of the bright spot] being “lower” than the skin, but instead it is only “dim.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">78</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>And if the ‘bahereth’</i> (<i>bright spot</i>) <i>stay in its place … but it be dim … the priest shall pronounce him clean</i> (Verse 28).</i><br>Now the Torah desired the purity of Israel and the cleanliness of their bodies, and it therefore took measures to keep this sickness [of leprosy] far from them at its very inception, for these colors [of the plagues] are not yet the real leprosy, but they lead to it. Doctors state in their books: “We should fear <i>beharoth</i> [bright spots in the skin of the flesh] more than the leprosy itself.” That is the reason why Scripture calls them when they are just beginning, <i>the affliction of leprosy</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">79</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verses 2, 3, 9, etc.</i> meaning an affliction of a leprous nature, but not yet the actual leprosy. It is when the symptoms of impurity are clearly identified, after the leper has been put in quarantine [for a trial period], that Scripture says, <i>it is leprosy</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">80</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 8.</i> meaning that it is possible that it is a genuine form of leprosy. At times Scripture will say of impurity, <i>and the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is an affliction of leprosy</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">81</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 25.</i> the meaning thereof being to state that the priest shall declare him impure at once, for it is an affliction of a leprous nature that will surely result in actual leprosy, and therefore it is advisable that he be separated from the people from that moment on. Similarly, <i>and the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is an affliction</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">82</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 22.</i> means that it is a great affliction which will not be healed [easily], but instead will grow the whole day and spread [into the skin] as it has done till now.<br>As to that which Rashi stated [in Verse 3 before us] that: “It is a Scriptural ordinance [the reason of which is not known] that hair that has become white is a symptom of impurity” — <i>this is the interpretation of the thing;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">83</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Daniel 5:26.</i> <i>it is the decree of the Most High, which is come upon</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">84</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 4:21.</i> that person, for a plague which does not turn the hair white, is only an ugly spot in the skin, but not a secretion which will cause any sickness."

Thus if after having shut the person up in a house for seven days, the priest is in doubt whether the plague has spread [in which case he would pronounce it at once as a genuine case of leprosy], but his son or pupil who saw it at the beginning says definitely that the affliction did not spread, the priest may follow their opinion and may shut him up for another seven days. See my Hebrew commentary p. 70, for further discussion of this point.</i> “[From the expression here] I know only that the plague so appeared [i.e., in its original size] in his own [i.e., the priest’s] eyes. Whence do I know that the same law applies if it so appeared in the eyes of his pupil? Scripture therefore says [in Verse 27]. <i>But if the scall stay ‘b’einav.’</i>” Now if so, the meaning of the verse here would be: “and if the plague is at a stay in the sight of the aforementioned priest,” namely that it has remained as it was, neither having changed its place nor having spread in the skin, wheresoever the priest looks [then he shall shut him up for another seven days].

Instead, it must mean, as Rashi points out, “if the plague <i>has become</i> pale,” serving as a verb.</i> than its [former] color. [This allows the inference] that if the plague remains in its former color and has not extended in the skin, he is impure.”<br>This indeed is the sense of the verse.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">92</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For since the verse states two conditions for the priest’s pronouncement that the person is pure — namely, if the plague has become paler, and the plague be not spread in the skin — it is obvious that if only the first condition has been met, but not the second, that the person is impure. This is the meaning of Ramban’s comment on Rashi’s statement.</i> But the interpretation of our Rabbis is not so, for we have been taught in the Mishnah:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">93</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Negaim 1:3.</i> “To cause to be put in quarantine [for a second week] such a plague which continues unchanged at the end of the first week; to pronounce pure such a plague which continues unchanged by the end of the second week.” And in the Torath Kohanim the Rabbis have expressly said<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">94</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, Negaim 2:8.</i> that in the case of garments, if the plague is at a stay at the end of the first week, they are to be put in quarantine [for a second week], and if it be at a stay at the end of the second week, they are to be burnt; but in the case of a person, if the plague be at a stay at the end of the first week the priest is to put him in quarantine for another week, but if at the end of the second week it is still at a stay he is to pronounce him pure. And in Tractate Megillah the Rabbis have further said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">95</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Megillah 8 b.</i> “This excludes a leper who has been put in quarantine for a week, whose state of leprosy is determined not by his bodily condition, but merely by days.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“For if on the seventh day the symptoms of impurity are not found in the plague, namely, the black hair in it has not turned white, or that the plague did not spread in the skin, the priest will pronounce him pure, even though the plague is still at a stay” (Rashi, <i>ibid.</i>).</i> Now if it were necessary that the plague should become dim, then his purity <i>would</i> be dependent upon his bodily condition! Rashi himself explained it there in such language, saying that the leper’s purity is not dependent on the physical state of the plague, for if at the end of seven days a symptom of impurity — white hair or extension of the plague — is not found, the priest is to pronounce him pure although the plague has stayed in its appearance, that is at the end of the second week.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">97</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If the plague has stayed in its appearance at the end of the first week that the infected person was shut up, Verse 5 clearly states, <i>then the priest shall shut him up seven days more</i>. The discussion here relates only to the end of the second week.</i><br>Rather, this is what the Sages said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">98</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, Negaim 2:6.</i> at the end of the second week, whether the plague has paled from the color of snow to [the shade of white of] the lime used in the Sanctuary, or like the white of an egg’s membrane, or even if it has become stronger, namely, that it was at first like the lime [used in the Sanctuary] and then [at the end of the second week] it had become bright-white like snow, and all the more so if it remained in its original color — as long as it did not spread in the skin, the priest pronounces it pure. If so, the interpretation of this verse is as follows: “<i>if the plague be ‘keihah,’</i> meaning that it has turned into the color of another plague, such as from that of snow to that of lime, since <i>it has not spread in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean; it is but a scab</i>.” For in order that one should not say, “since the plague has changed into the color of another plague it must be inspected from anew,” Scripture therefore expressly taught that he is deemed pure. The same law applies if the color became stronger, since Scripture has already taught you that a change from color to color is not a symptom of impurity, but rather is considered as if it is at a stay, and as long as it did not spread in the skin [the afflicted person] is pure. Should you ask: “But why did Scripture not mention expressly the case of a change to a stronger color [as being pure], and we would know that this is all the more so if it became paler?” [The answer is that Scripture] came to teach you that although it became paler, if it spread in the skin he is nevertheless impure. Now the meaning of the word <i>keihah</i> is that the plague has become paler, changing to one of the colors of leprosy-signs, such as from that of snow to that of an egg’s membrane, which can still be a leprosy-sign. But if it has become paler than the colors of leprosy-signs, in that case the person is already healed, and there is no longer a plague; thus even a spreading thereof no longer renders him impure at all. In a similar manner to this presentation has it been explained in the Torath Kohanim.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">98</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, Negaim 2:6.</i>"

This is the name of the plague on a place where hair grows.” This is Rashi’s language.<br>It would appear from this language that the difference between a plague upon the head or beard and a plague in the skin of the flesh, is that which Rashi mentioned, namely, the white hair and the gold-colored; thus if a plague occurs in any of its four colors<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">105</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The four colors of the plagues are: <i>bahereth</i> (bright-white like snow), <i>se’eith</i> (white as white wool); <i>sid ha’heichal</i> (the white lime used in the Sanctuary), and <i>krum beitza</i> (the membrane of an egg). Of these four shades the whitest is <i>bahereth</i>, the next is <i>se’eith</i>, the next <i>sid</i>, and the dullest is <i>krum beitza</i> (Rambam Mishneh Torah, <i>Hilchoth Tum’ath Tzara’ath</i> 1:2). See further Note 107.</i> in a place where hair grows upon the head or beard, and if the hair became gold-colored, then the person is impure, just as he is impure if the hair turned white in a plague on the skin of the flesh. But how is it possible to say so! Rashi himself has written [further on]: “<i>As the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">106</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 43.</i> [It is like the color of the leprosy which is mentioned in the section dealing with plagues of the skin of the flesh, namely] that it makes one impure by means of any of the four white colors,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">105</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The four colors of the plagues are: <i>bahereth</i> (bright-white like snow), <i>se’eith</i> (white as white wool); <i>sid ha’heichal</i> (the white lime used in the Sanctuary), and <i>krum beitza</i> (the membrane of an egg).

See further Note 107.</i> and it is not to be treated like the color of the <i>nethakim</i> (scalls) on the place where hair grows, which do not render a person impure by reason of the four colors: the <i>se’eith</i> and its secondary shade, and <i>bahereth</i> and its secondary shade!”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">107</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sid ha’heichal</i> is the secondary shade of <i>bahereth</i>, and <i>krum beitza</i> is the subsidiary species of <i>se’eith</i>. A priest who does not distinguish between these four shades of white, and does not know them by name and how they are related to each other, has no authority to inspect the plague (Rambam, above, Note 105). He may, however, bring with him a learned person — even if he be an Israelite — who upon examining it will direct him to say “pure” or “impure” etc. (Rambam, <i>ibid.</i>, 9:2).</i> Now if [a <i>nethek</i>] does not render the person impure by means of one of these four colors,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">105</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The four colors of the plagues are: <i>bahereth</i> (bright-white like snow), <i>se’eith</i> (white as white wool); <i>sid ha’heichal</i> (the white lime used in the Sanctuary), and <i>krum beitza</i> (the membrane of an egg).

See further Note 107.</i> then by what color and under what condition <i>does</i> it render one impure? Scripture has mentioned only the signs necessary for declaring him <i>absolutely</i> impure, namely, if gold-colored hair appeared in the <i>nethek</i> or spreading thereof took place<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">108</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verses 30, 36.</i> [but, according to Rashi, Scripture has left unspecified what color the <i>nethek</i> must be originally, in order that it be subject to inspection]! Indeed, it seems that the Rabbi [Rashi] thought Scripture informed us of the name of the plague upon the head or beard by stating <i>‘nethek hu’</i> (<i>it is a scall</i>)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">109</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 30.</i> meaning that this is its particular name, the designation by which it is recognized. Thus Scripture mentioned in the case of the plagues [in the skin of the flesh] their names and their colors, namely, <i>‘bahereth l’vanah’</i> (<i>a bright spot which is white</i>),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">110</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 4.</i> <i>‘se’eith l’vanah’</i> (<i>a white rising</i>),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">111</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 10.</i> and in the case of the head it also mentioned its name [namely, <i>nethek</i>], for by that designation it is known, and that name indeed Scripture declared to be impure, and then it went back and explained the symptoms [of the <i>nethek</i>] for the person to be declared absolutely impure at the end [i.e., after he had been put in quarantine for a week]. This is the Rabbi’s [Rashi’s] opinion on the <i>nethek</i> (scall).<br>This interpretation of Rashi’s opinion is further borne out by his words when he said that the sense of the following section, <i>And the man whose hair is fallen off his head</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">112</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 40.</i> is to say that if a man’s hair falls off his head and he becomes bald, <i>he is clean</i>; that is, “he is clean from the impurity of <i>nethakim</i> (scalls in a hair-spot) on the head,” and he is no longer rendered impure by the kind of plague called <i>nethek</i>, but instead he is subject to the laws of a plague on the skin of the flesh, [namely] <i>se’eith</i> and its secondary shade, for since there is no hair there [after becoming bald] he is excluded from the law applying to the head or the beard.<br>But all this is not so. For as long as the head or beard contain hair, they do not render the person impure at all by means of any of the colors of leprosy [since they are not “the skin of the body”]. But when baldness affects a certain part of the head, the hair falling out from its very roots, and that place becomes smooth and clear of any hair, and then there grows in that baldness <i>a gold-colored thin hair</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">109</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 30.</i> — that is the impure plague [dealt with here]. It is for that reason that it is called <i>nethek</i> [of the root <i>nothak</i> — “to tear away”] because the hair has become removed from there, and it is not merely a name, as the Rabbi [Rashi] wrote. Rather, <i>for as his name is, so is he</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">113</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 25:25.</i> for [in order that the law of <i>nethek</i> should apply], it is necessary that the hair falls out [on the head or the beard] in a place [at least] the size of a bean, and after the natural falling out of this first hair from that place, if that gold-colored “afflicted” hair springs up, it is a symptom of impurity. This does not apply if the gold-colored hair come there before the baldness. So also we have been taught in a Mishnah:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">114</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Negaim 7:1.</i> “If [<i>a bahereth</i>] appeared on the head or the beard,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">115</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Now the head or the beard become impure only by a <i>nethek</i> (scall), and not by a <i>bahereth;</i> (a bright white spot). Thus when the <i>bahereth</i> first appeared on the head or the beard, the person remained pure. Later on when he became bald, in which case the law of <i>bahereth</i> might have applied, he also remains pure, because the <i>bahereth</i> preceded the baldness.</i> and then the head or the beard became bald, they are pure. If it were on the head or the beard before these grew hair, and they then grew hair and again became bald, Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov declares them impure, since both in the beginning and at the end they were impure. But the Sages declare them to be pure.” And with regards to gold-colored hair which precede [the <i>nethek</i>] we have also been taught in a Mishnah:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">116</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 10:4.</i> “If gold-colored hair preceded the <i>nethek</i> (scall) it is pure. Rabbi Yehudah declares it impure. Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says: It neither renders the person impure, nor does it afford him protection.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">117</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The law of hair which has become gold-colored because of the <i>nethek</i> provides that if there be two black hairs in it, the person is pure [although all the other hair have turned gold-colored]. But if there be in it two gold-colored hairs that were there before the <i>nethek</i> came, and turned the other black hair gold-colored, they do not afford protection to the <i>nethek</i>, and the person is impure. Thus Rabbi Eliezer’s statement: “It neither renders the person impure [if all the hair turned gold-colored before the <i>nethek</i> appeared], nor does it afford protection” [thus we do not say that since it was naturally gold-colored before the <i>nethek</i> appeared, and not as a result of it, it is considered like black hair which renders the person pure, because although it is not in itself a symptom of the plague, it is nonetheless unable to protect the person from impurity unless its natural colors is black].</i> This whole topic is similarly taught also in the Sifra.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">118</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Tazria</i> 8:6.</i><br>The reason why Scripture does not mention “the baldness” at first [but instead begins Verse 29 before us by stating: <i>If a man or woman hath an affliction upon the head or the beard</i>], is because it mentioned with reference to the plague on the head or beard a “deep appearance” and “gold-colored hair,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">109</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 30.</i> and it is impossible that the appearance thereof should be deep in the same way that the color of the sun appears deeper than the shadow, as long as a person’s black natural hair is still upon him. Therefore Scripture spoke about the customary way of people, for when plagues come upon their head, [that part of the head] first becomes bald, and then a plague arises in the baldness, in which the thin short gold-colored hair grows. Then [in Verse 30] Scripture explains <i>‘nethek hu’</i> (<i>it is a scall</i>), in order to make it quite clear that he is not to be declared impure unless there was a baldness.<br>Now in the opinion of most commentators<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">119</sup><i class=\"footnote\">So clearly set forth by Rabad in Mishneh Torah, <i>Hilchoth Tum’ath Tzara’ath</i>, 8:1, and in 16:1.</i> this plague, namely, the <i>nethek</i>, need not have a <i>bahereth</i> (a bright spot) or <i>se’eith</i> (rising) nor their subsidiary species,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">107</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sid ha’heichal</i> is the secondary shade of <i>bahereth</i>, and <i>krum beitza</i> is the subsidiary species of <i>se’eith</i>. A priest who does not distinguish between these four shades of white, and does not know them by name and how they are related to each other, has no authority to inspect the plague (Rambam, above, Note 105). He may, however, bring with him a learned person — even if he be an Israelite — who upon examining it will direct him to say “pure” or “impure” etc. (Rambam, <i>ibid.</i>, 9:2).</i> nor any change of appearance in the skin of the head, but as soon as the hair fell out from a spot the size of a bean on the head or beard, and is entirely uprooted from its roots, that is the plague, and if thin gold-colored hair appears in it, the person is impure. This is <i>the leprosy of the head or of the beard</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">109</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 30.</i> For Scripture first declared the person impure <i>if the appearance thereof be deeper than the skin, and there be in it gold-colored thin hair</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">109</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 30.</i> and then it mentioned that if <i>the appearance thereof is not deeper than the skin</i>, that the plague must be shut up for a week;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">120</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 31.</i> then it declared him to be impure if [after this week] the <i>nethek</i> spread in the skin,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">121</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 36.</i> the sense thereof being that [in the case of the spreading of the <i>nethek</i>] the appearance thereof need not be deeper than the skin, nor different in any way [for him to be declared impure]. Now surely these two symptoms [of impurity in the <i>nethek</i>], namely, spreading of the plague and appearance of gold-colored hair, are alike in their laws. If so, the verses intend to teach us that whether the appearance of the <i>nethek</i> is as deep as the appearance of a <i>bahereth</i>, or whether it is not as deep or is not different in any way [from the rest of the skin], as soon as the baldness occurs, the person is rendered impure if gold-colored hair appears in it or if the <i>nethek</i> spreads in the skin. There are many Beraithoth<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">122</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See in <i>Seder Vayikra</i>, Note 65.

On Sifra, see <i>ibid.</i>, Note 121.</i> taught on this subject.<br>Yet [despite all this] it would appear that after the hair falls off from a spot on the head, it is not to be deemed a plague until a <i>bahereth</i> or its subsidiary species appears in that bald spot, or a <i>se’eith</i> or its subsidiary species,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">107</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sid ha’heichal</i> is the secondary shade of <i>bahereth</i>, and <i>krum beitza</i> is the subsidiary species of <i>se’eith</i>.

Of these four shades the whitest is <i>bahereth</i>, the next is <i>se’eith</i>, the next <i>sid</i>, and the dullest is <i>krum beitza</i> (Rambam Mishneh Torah, <i>Hilchoth Tum’ath Tzara’ath</i> 1:2).

The effect of this is sometimes a more lenient ruling, and sometimes a more stringent one. The more lenient ruling is that they do not render the person impure by means of white hair, and the more stringent one is that he is to be pronounced impure by reason of the gold-colored hair. And the interpretation of the verse, <i>And if the priest see the plague of the scall, and, behold, the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin, and there be no black hair in it, then the priest shall shut up</i> [<i>him that hath</i>] <i>the plague of the scall seven days</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">120</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 31.</i> is similar to that mentioned above [in the section dealing with the plagues of the skin of the flesh]: <i>And if ‘bahereth’</i> (<i>the bright spot</i>) <i>be white in the skin of the flesh, and the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">110</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 4.</i> for the expression <i>‘nega hanethek’</i> (<i>the plague of the scall</i>) [here in Verse 31] alludes to the principle that the [four] colors of the “plagues” apply to the <i>nethek</i> as well.<br>This matter requires further study of the Tosephta<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">124</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “Addition.” The Tosephta is a collection of Beraithoth, compiled by Rabbi Chiya, soon after the Mishnah was completed by Rabbi Yehudah Hanasi. The books of the Tosephta follow closely those of the Mishnah. Hence the expression here, “the Tosephta to Tractate Negaim.”</i> to Tractate Negaim. For we have been taught there as follows:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">125</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tosephta Negaim 1:2.</i> “<i>Nethakim</i> (scalls) cause impurity in all colors, even white on black or black on white, and they cause impurity by means of thin yellow hair which appears to be gold-colored.” Thus far [is the language of the Tosephta]. It would appear from this text that there has to be in the bald part some [distinguishing] color of a plague, either white on the skin of a black-haired man, like the [four] colors of plagues, or even a black plague on the skin of a white-haired man, like “the black <i>murphia</i>” which doctors mention, since Scripture always speaks of <i>‘nega hanethek’</i> (<i>the plague of the scall</i>),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">120</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 31.</i> indicating that there has to be a plague in the <i>nethek</i>, but it did not specify any colors for them as it did in the case of [the plagues of] the skin of the flesh. And the second section, <i>And the man whose hair is fallen off his head</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">112</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 40.</i> teaches that the law of <i>nethakim</i> applies only if the hair falls off the middle of the head, and hair remains surrounding the <i>nethek</i> on all sides. But if the hair falls off from the back of the head, or towards the face, and that whole side becomes bald [and a plague appeared therein], its status is not to be determined by the symptoms of impurity of the head or beard [namely, gold-colored hair or the spreading of the <i>nethek</i>], but rather by the symptoms of plagues of the skin of the flesh [namely, the appearance of white hair or the spreading of the plague or quick flesh]. The reason for this [distinction between the various locations of the baldness of the head] is that it is in the nature of many people that some of their hair at the sides of the head, in the back or in front becomes bald, and the falling off of the hair there is no sign of sickness, but instead is like the rest of the body. But when the hair falls off from the middle of the head, the place where there normally is hair, it can only be a plague which caused it, that plague in our language being termed <i>tinim</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">126</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In one Ramban manuscript: <i>tirna</i>.</i> and in Arabic it is called <i>al sa’afah</i>. Accordingly Scripture excluded from this law hair which falls out from the front of his head and the back, since it is usual for people to become bald at those places. And the verse which states, <i>But if there be ‘bakarachath’</i> (<i>in the bald towards the back of the head</i>), <i>or ‘bagabachath’</i> (<i>the bald forehead</i>), <i>a reddish-white plague</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">127</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 42.</i> means that these parts of the head convey impurity as does the rest of the body — by the [four] colors of plagues whether there is a reddish mixture in the white or it be a plain white. Scripture further states <i>as the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the flesh</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">106</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 43.</i> This means that [if there is baldness towards the back of the head or the forehead] he is also certified absolutely as impure by quick flesh or the spreading of the plague, which is “the appearance of leprosy” that is certified absolutely as impure in plagues of the skin of the flesh. Now our Rabbis have mentioned that it is not certified as impure by means of white hair, just as we have been taught [in a Mishnah]:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">128</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Negaim 4:3.</i> “Quick flesh causes impurity <i>bakarachath</i> (in baldness towards the back of the head), or <i>bagabachath</i> (baldness in the forehead), whereas it is not so with the white hair.” It is also so expressed in the Torath Kohanim.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">129</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, Negaim 11:2.</i><br>But some of the commentators<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">130</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Found in the commentary of Rabbeinu Shimshon of Sens to Negaim 10:10. See my Hebrew commentary, p. 74.</i> stated that the sense of the Scriptural sections is to differentiate between a person afflicted with a <i>nethek</i> [which is discussed in Verses 29-37] and with baldness [as mentioned in Verses 40-44]; and the meaning of the matter is that <i>karachath</i> and <i>gabachath</i> both denote plucking out of the hair in such a manner that it will never grow again, such as where he applied a certain ointment to the hair of his head which caused it to fall out, or where it fell out at its roots naturally, when the moisture [feeding it] dried up. Thus the meaning of this section according to this opinion is that at first Scripture spoke [in Verses 29-37] of <i>nethek</i>, which is a falling off or cutting of the hair, similar to the expressions: <i>‘v’nathuk v’charuth’</i> (<i>or torn off, or cut</i>);<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">131</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 22:24.</i> <i>as soon as the soles of the priests’ feet ‘nithku’</i> (<i>were drawn up</i>) <i>unto the dry ground</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">132</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 4:18.</i> Then Scripture states [in Verses 40-44] that if the head be <i>yimareit</i>, meaning that the hair was plucked out by force, thus leaving the bald and shiny <i>like burnished brass</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">133</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Kings 7:45.</i> similar to that which is written, <i>it is furbished that it may glitter</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">134</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 21:15.</i> which as is known will never grow hair again — that is not a <i>nethek</i>, but rather this man <i>‘keireiach hu’</i> (<i>he is bald in the back of his head</i>)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">135</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 40.</i> or <i>gibeiach hu’</i> (<i>he is bald near his forehead</i>),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">136</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 41.</i> as other people who are bald, and <i>he is clean</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">137</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verses 40-41.</i>. But if there be in this baldness towards the back or front of the head one of the [four] colors of plagues<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">105</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The four colors of the plagues are: <i>bahereth</i> (bright-white like snow), <i>se’eith</i> (white as white wool); <i>sid ha’heichal</i> (the white lime used in the Sanctuary), and <i>krum beitza</i> (the membrane of an egg). Of these four shades the whitest is <i>bahereth</i>, the next is <i>se’eith</i>, the next <i>sid</i>, and the dullest is <i>krum beitza</i> (Rambam Mishneh Torah, <i>Hilchoth Tum’ath Tzara’ath</i> 1:2). See further Note 107.</i>, he will be subject to the same law of impurity as is the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the flesh, and through their symptoms, namely, quick flesh and the spreading of the plague in the skin [after having been shut up for a week]; except that the Sages in their interpretation excluded from [these symptoms of impurity] white hair [which in the skin of the flesh <i>is</i> a sign of impurity but not in baldness towards the back or front of the head]. The reason for this is that the hair of the head has been plucked out in such a way that it will never grow again, and even if a few hair appear by chance, they will never be black [so that they could through turning white on account of the plague, serve as a sign of impurity], nor will they have the characteristics of hair, but they will be merely some weak form thereof and white. This is the opinion of the French scholars in the commentary to Tractate Negaim.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">130</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Found in the commentary of Rabbeinu Shimshon of Sens to Negaim 10:10. See my Hebrew commentary, p. 74.</i> The sense of the Mishnayoth and Beraithoth taught there [in that tractate] tend to support their words. If so, <i>nethek</i> [mentioned in Verses 29-37] is the sickness [called in Arabic] <i>sa’afah</i> [as stated above], or the well-known sicknesses called “the sickness of the fox,” and “the path of the snake,” all these being forms of sickness which can be remedied [so that the hair grows again]; but “the plucking out” of the hair [mentioned in Verses 40-44] is a form of baldness for which there is no help or remedy at all."

In line with the plain meaning of Scripture the verse warns that he should not use a razor on the place of the <i>nethek</i>, for even though there is no hair on it, yet if he passes the razor over it the skin will be scratched causing hair to grow in it; for such is the nature of people who have scabs on their heads, and all those who make their hair to fall off, to scratch the place on the head and also to make certain cuts in it with a knife.<br>But in the Torath Kohanim the Sages interpreted the verse as follows:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">138</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, Negaim 9:7.</i> “<i>But the ‘nethek’ shall he not shave</i>. But what is there to shave there?” That is to say, has not the hair fallen off from it? [So what need is there for Scripture to warn him not to shave it?] “Rather, the verse means, <i>around</i> the <i>nethek</i> he is not to shave. How can we explain this? He shaves the space outside it, but leaves [a circle] of two hairs [width] next to the <i>nethek</i>, so that it should be possible to discern if it spreads.” It is this which Onkelos translated: “and he shall shave around the scall, and that which is within the scall he shall not shave,” for he is to leave on all its sides a row of two hairs in order to recognize [at the end of seven days] if the <i>nethek</i> has spread [in which case the priest will pronounce him impure]. And the meaning of the word <i>v’eth</i> [<i>v’eth hanethek</i>] is then like the expression, <i>and David came near ‘eth’ the people, and he saluted them</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">139</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 30:21.</i> which means that he came near them but he did not enter into their midst.

This is not in the natural order of things, nor does it ever happen in the world [outside Israel], and similarly leprosy of houses<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">140</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 14:33-53.</i> [is not a natural phenomenon]. But when Israel is wholly devoted to G-d, then His spirit is upon them always, to maintain their bodies, clothes and houses in a good appearance. Thus as soon as one of them commits a sin or transgression, a deformity appears in his flesh, or on his garment, or in his house, revealing that G-d has turned aside from him. It is for this reason that Scripture states, <i>And I shall put the plague of leprosy in a house of the Land of your possession</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">141</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 14:34.</i> meaning that it is G-d’s punishment upon that house.

Ramban is now pointing out that the reason why the law of leprosy in houses does not apply outside the Land of Israel is not because it attaches to the land, but for the reason etc.</i>, but the reason is because this matter [of Divine indication of sins] occurs only in the Chosen Land, wherein the Glorious Name dwells. And in the Torath Kohanim the Sages further interpreted<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">144</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Metzora</i> 5:3.</i> that a house does not contract impurity until after the conquest and division [of the Land by Israel], and until after each and every individual clearly knows his portion. The reason for this law is that only then do they have the ease of mind to know the Eternal, and the Divine Glory dwells among them. I think similarly with reference to the law of leprosy in garments, that it applies only in the Land [of Israel], it being unnecessary to exclude [the application of this law] in places outside the Land, since they never occur there. For this reason also the law of leprosy in garments applies only to white garments, not to colored ones, because the color might perhaps have extracted this unclean phenomenon [i.e., the leprosy] in that place [in the garment] in a natural way, and it will then not be regarded as <i>a finger of G-d</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">145</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 8:15.</i> Therefore garments colored by Heaven can contract impurity, according to the words of Rabbi Shimon.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">146</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Negaim 11:3.</i> And by way of the simple meaning of Scripture, the reason why it repeats in every verse the expression “<i>the garment, or the skin, or the wrap and the woof</i>,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">147</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Verses 49, 51, 52, 53, 56, 57, 58, 59.</i> is because the matter is miraculous.

Those who said that they become free, are also of the opinion that they may now be used [for some benefit], and those who say that they do not become free are also of the opinion that they are still forbidden [to be made use of], for it is written: <i>it is a leprosy that is ‘mam’ereth’</i>, meaning, attach a curse to it and derive no benefit from it. Rabbi Abohu said in the name of Rabbi Yochanan: All things which must be burnt, one may derive benefit from their ashes, except for the ashes of an idol. Rabbi Chiya the son of Yosei asked Rabbi Yochanan: ‘There is the case of the ashes of a house [affected with leprosy], which is not related to idolatry, and yet you say that the ashes thereof are forbidden for any use [like the stones which have been turned into lime or plaster]!

Scripture is stating that this shall be the law of the leper in the day that he wishes to be pronounced pure, that he should be brought to the priest, as he can never attain purity except by means of the priest’s word.

But according to the Torath Kohanim the verse means: “on the day he is actually ‘cleansed’ of the sickness, i.e., on the day that he is physically healed of the affliction, there must be no delay and he is to be brought before the priest.”</i> he is to be brought even against his will to the priest.

Similarly, the expression <i>let him return v’yitzpor’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Judges 7:3.</i> means, and arise “early in the morning.” The expression <i>‘tzipor’</i> (<i>the fowl of</i>) <i>the air</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 8:9.</i> is said with reference to these small birds, because it is mostly they that fly high in the air. <i>Every ‘tzipor’</i> (<i>bird</i>) <i>of every sort</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 7:14.</i> refers to two kinds, all the little ones and the big ones. <i>If a ‘kan tzipor’</i> (<i>bird’s nest</i>) <i>chance to be before thee</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 22:6.</i> speaks about the little ones which are many [and therefore likely to chance to be there], to teach that even when they are young, the finder must exercise mercy towards them.

Rabbeinu Chananel explains the text of the Gemara in the following words: “he holds the whole world in his hand as one holds a bird.” Here too the reference is to a small bird that the holder can easily control in the palm of his hand.</i> [one may not derive any benefit from, since these objects indicate that the statue is worshipped as an idol]; “If a man wove into a garment one <i>sit’s</i> length of a Nazirite’s hair [from which one is forbidden to derive any benefit], the garment is to be burnt,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Terumah 34 a.

The Mishnah there in speaking with reference to taking out any object from one domain to another on the Sabbath, states: “for <i>tziporoth</i> (birds of) the vineyard, whether alive or dead, [he is liable], however small [the size be].” It is thus clear that the word <i>tzipor</i> is used by the Sages to mean a small bird, which even when alive is “however small.”</i> They also said: “the meat of <i>tziporim</i> (birds) brings back a sickness to a sick man [who is recovering, and makes it worse”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Berachoth 57 b. Having proven that the term <i>tzipor</i> refers to a small bird, Ramban now begins to elucidate further that it means both a permissible and forbidden species of bird. Here in the text of Berachoth it definitely means a permissible bird, but further it will be shown that it may mean also a forbidden bird.</i> thus indicating that the term <i>tzipor</i> refers to a bird which one may eat]. Scripture further states, <i>All ‘tzipor’</i> (<i>birds</i>) <i>that are clean ye may eat</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 14:11.</i> meaning all these many species of [permissible] birds, thus including [the living bird sent away by] the leper [into the open field<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 7.</i> as permissible food],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban here alludes to a question that was raised in the Gemara (Chullin 140 a), as to whether the living bird of the leper that is sent into the open field is permissible to be eaten if caught by someone. To this the answer was given that one is permitted to eat it; for since the Torah stated <i>‘All’ birds that are clean ye may eat</i> (Deuteronomy 14:11), meaning any bird of a permissible species that is found may be eaten, now if the living bird of the leper were forbidden to be eaten, the Torah would not command the bird to be sent off, as this could involve a possible offense [since if the bird were not in fact permitted to be eaten, one might catch it without knowing that it had been used by the leper, and eat it]! Now, concludes Ramban, this permission is based in the Talmud on the word ‘all’ (‘<i>All birds</i> etc.) as explained above. This proves that the word <i>tzipor</i>, such as found here in the text before us, does not of itself only mean a permissible kind of bird. Rather, since it is a term for both the permissible and forbidden kind, it was therefore necessary for the Torath Kohanim here to establish that the leper’s bird must be of a permissible species, from the word <i>clean</i> qualifying <i>tziporim</i>.</i> by means of the word <i>kol</i> (<i>‘All’ birds that are clean ye may eat</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 14:11.</i> And the verse which states, <i>But these are they of which ye shall not eat: the great vulture, and the bearded vulture, and the osprey</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 14:12. Having established that the word <i>tzipor</i> means “a small” bird, whether of a permissible or forbidden kind, Ramban finds this verse difficult, since the expression <i>of them</i> [in translation of the verse: “of which”] apparently refers back to <i>‘kol tzipor’</i> (<i>birds</i>) mentioned in the previous verse [11], and yet it mentions here (in Verse 12) big birds like the great vulture, etc. In addition, the word <i>tzipor</i> in Verse 11 is explicitly qualified by the word <i>‘t’horah,’</i> thus excluding the great vulture. Ramban’s answer follows in the text, where he explains that the expression <i>of them</i> does not refer back to <i>‘kol tzipor’</i> (<i>all birds</i>) previously mentioned, but rather means “of their flesh,” i.e., the flesh of these big birds about to be mentioned — the great vulture, etc.</i> is [to be understood] as if it said, “and these are they, from the flesh of which ye may not eat.” It is for this reason [i.e., since the term <i>tzipor</i> includes both permissible and forbidden birds], that the Sages found it necessary to interpret:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Metzora</i> 1:12.</i> “<i>Clean</i>, not forbidden birds” [but they would not have been able to derive it if the word <i>tziporim</i> had not been qualified]. In any case it is clear that <i>tziporim</i> are the small chirping birds. Similarly, <i>Yea, the ‘tzipor’ hath found a house, and the swallow a nest for herself</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 84:4.</i> also indicates that the word <i>tzipor</i> is not a name for all birds [for otherwise why should the verse mention both <i>tzipor</i> and the swallow, if the term <i>tzipor</i> already includes all birds]. Likewise, <i>Wherein tziporim</i> (<i>the birds</i>) <i>make their nests, the stork makes the fir-tree her house</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 104:17.</i> [indicates that <i>tziporim</i> does not include all birds, since the verse proceeds also to mention some specific birds].<br>It would appear from the words of our Sages that all birds permissible as food are called <i>tzipor</i>, but the leper was commanded to bring <i>tziporei dror</i> [“free birds,” a term which, as explained further on means birds which live in the house as well as in the field], for we have been taught in the Torath Kohanim:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Metzora</i> 5:13.</i> “<i>And he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open field</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 53.</i> Rabbi Yosei the Galilean said: ‘This means a bird that lives outside all cities. And what kind of bird is it? It is the bird called <i>dror</i>’” [the free bird that lives in the house as well as in the field]. It is on the basis of this interpretation of the Rabbis that they further mentioned [in connection with the leper’s birds] that they “chatter” [since it is usually these free birds which twitter].<br>It is possible that the requirement that the birds be of “the free” kind is a commandment [which is to be observed if possible, but is not indispensable], so that if it has already been done, they are all valid [whether free or unfree]. Therefore the Sages in the Torath Kohanim<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Metzora</i> 1:12.</i> found it necessary to exclude forbidden bird’s [which do not possess this characteristic of living in the house and in the field]. And so we have been taught in a Mishnah of Tractate Negaim:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Negaim 14:1.</i> “And he [the leper] brought two birds that are of the free type of bird.” And it is furthermore taught there:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 5.</i> “It is a commandment that the two birds of the leper should be alike in appearance, in size and in value, and that they should be brought at the same time. Yet even if they are not alike, they are valid. If one was slaughtered and it was found that it was not a ‘free bird,’ he should buy a partner for the second one.” The reason [why he must buy a partner for the second one] although [as we have said above] if it has already been done, all birds [whether free or unfree] are valid, is that if they were of two different kinds [as in this case, where the slaughtered one was a non-<i>dror</i>, and the living one a <i>dror</i>], they <i>are</i> invalid. And in the Chapter <i>Eilu Treifoth</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“These are accounted <i>treifah</i>” among cattle. It is the third chapter of Tractate Chullin. The text quoted here is found there on 62 a. For the word <i>treifah</i>, see above, Note 7.</i> the Sages of the Gemara have said: “A bird which scratches, is valid to be used for the purification of the leper. This is the white-bellied swallow concerning which Rabbi Eliezer and the Sages differed” [as explained further on]. From these texts [it is clear] that the birds for the purification of the leper are not limited to one species, and that the purification is not to be done with <i>any</i> permissible bird, but rather the commandment is that it be done only with those birds that are <i>dror</i>, that is to say, “which live in the house as well as in the field.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shabbath 106 b.</i> Therefore the Rabbis said [in the above-quoted text] with reference to the white-bellied swallow, that since according to the Sages it is a bird which may be eaten, it is also valid for the purification of the leper, as it is included within [the category of those birds that are] <i>dror</i> [living in the house as well as in the field]. Yet nonetheless <i>all</i> permissible birds [even those that are not “free birds”] are valid, if the purification of the leper has already been done with them, since they are all included within the phrase, <i>two living clean birds</i>.<br>And we have been taught in the Sifre:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifre, <i>R’eih</i> 103. See in <i>Seder Vayikra</i> Note 121, on Sifre.</i> “Rabbi Yashiyah said: ‘Wherever it says in Scripture <i>tzipor</i>, it speaks of a permissible bird.’ Said Rabbi Yitzchak: ‘A permissible bird is called <i>oph</i> (fowl) and also <i>tzipor</i> (bird), but a forbidden one is only called <i>oph</i>.” Similarly the Rabbis mentioned also in the Gemara [of Tractate Chullin], in the Chapter <i>Shilu’ach Hakan</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“The letting of [the dam] go from the nest.” It is the twelfth chapter of Tractate Chullin, discussing the law stated in Deuteronomy 22:6-7. The text quoted here is found there on p. 140 a.</i> where they resolved that the term <i>living</i> [<i>two ‘living’ clean birds</i>] means “the ends of whose limbs ‘live’ (exist), thus excluding birds from whom a limb is missing.” Similarly [permissible] birds which are <i>treifah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Treifah</i> according to the accepted opinion (see Note 9 below), is an animal or bird suffering from one of certain organic diseases from which it is bound to die within twelve months, even though it be ritually slaughtered. Thus the word <i>living</i> excludes a bird which will die from a disease. Ramban further on will comment on this point.</i> are invalid [for the purification of the leper]. The Rabbis also interpreted there<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“The letting of [the dam] go from the nest.” It is the twelfth chapter of Tractate Chullin, discussing the law stated in Deuteronomy 22:6-7. The text quoted here is found there on p. 140 a.</i> the term <i>clean</i> [<i>two living ‘clean’ birds</i>] to exclude those birds which are of a permissible species but are forbidden to be eaten [for some special reason], such as birds belonging to a person of a city that went astray,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Deuteronomy 13:16-18, that all the belongings thereof are to be destroyed.</i> or a fowl that killed a human being, or those that have been exchanged for an idol.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus if one received birds of a permissible species as payment for an idol, they are nonetheless forbidden for <i>any</i> use, just as the original idol may not be made any use of.</i> This interpretation was derived by the Sages from the very language itself, since the term <i>tzipor</i> denotes only a permissible bird. It is clear then from this text, that all permissible birds [whether they are of the dror-type or not] are included within the category of <i>tzipor</i>.<br>I have further seen in the Yerushalmi of Tractate Nazir<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yerushalmi Nazir I, 1. — To understand the name “‘Yerushalmi of Nazir,” it is important to note that after the Mishnah was completed by Rabbi Yehudah Hanasi — also known as Rabbeinu Hakadosh — in the Land of Israel [about the year 200 of Common Era] it formed, the basis of study in all academies of learning. But whereas hitherto all the great Yeshivoth were concentrated in the Land of Israel, after the completion of the Mishnah two groups of Yeshivoth came into prominence: those of the Land of Israel, and those of Babylon. Thus for a number of generations there existed side by side two groups of academies where the Mishnah was studied and interpreted. In the course of time, the continuous Roman persecutions forced the closing of the Palestinian schools of learning; but before they were finally closed, the Rabbis compiled their teachings in what is known as the <i>Talmud Yerushalmi</i> i.e., the Jerusalem Talmud. The academies in Babylon flourished for many centuries longer. Their teachings were later compiled [about the year 475 of Common Era] and are known as the Babylonian Talmud. To this day Talmudic study is almost exclusively devoted to the Babylonian Talmud, so that any tractate of the Talmud generally cited, is that of the Babylonian Talmud, unless specified as in the case before us: “the Yerushalmi of Tractate” so-and-so. A tradition has it that after the redaction of the Jerusalem Talmud, its Sages went down as a group to Babylon, and most of their teachings were incorporated into the text of the Babylonian Talmud. This explains why Talmudic study throughout the ages was concentrated almost entirely upon the Babylonian Talmud, while only the outstanding Rabbis of the generations devoted their studies also to the Jerusalem Talmud.</i> that the Sages of the Gemara said: “But does an impure Nazirite really bring <i>tziporim</i>?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The question refers back to a statement in the Mishnah which reads: “If a person said, ‘I pledge myself to offer <i>tziporim</i> (birds),’ Rabbi Meir says that he becomes a Nazirite etc.” The reason for this opinion of Rabbi Meir was explained there in the Gemara by Resh Lakish, that it is because a Nazirite whose consecration has been defiled, must bring <i>tziporim</i> as an atonement (Numbers 6:9-11). On this explanation of Resh Lakish, the Gemara asked: “But does a Nazirite really bring <i>tziporim</i>? It is turtle-doves or young pigeons that he brings!” In other words, <i>tziporim</i> means birds which are of a forbidden kind, while the Nazirite must bring birds which are permissible to be eaten! So how could the reason Resh Lakish advanced to explain Rabbi Meir’s opinion be correct, since <i>tziporim</i> (forbidden birds) are not used at all by a Nazirite! — Ramban is thus beginning at this point to refute his own explanation which he had set forth, namely, that <i>tzipor</i> refers only to a permissible bird, since it is evident from the Yerushalmi that <i>tzipor</i> means a forbidden bird! The final solution of the Yerushalmi follows.</i> It is turtle-doves or young pigeons that he brings! [To this question the reply was made:] ‘There are some authorities who teach that all edible birds are called <i>tziporim</i>, and there are other authorities that teach that all birds, whether permissible or forbidden, are called <i>tziporim</i>.’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hence he who said, “I pledge myself to offer <i>tziporim</i>, becomes a Nazirite even according to those authorities that hold that the term <i>tziporim</i> denotes all kinds of birds, permissible ones or forbidden ones, for since it also denotes permissible birds, his intention was those birds that may be brought upon the altar (P’nei Moshe).</i> Thus we are now left with a divergence of opinion [as to what the term <i>tzipor</i> denotes]! Yet it is possible that the name applies only to the small birds. This appears so in the Gemara from what the Rabbis have said in Tractate Sotah:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sotah 16 b.</i> [In the process of his purification the leper is commanded to] “bring a sufficient amount of water that the bird’s blood may remain discernible in it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 5 here reads: <i>And the priest shall command that one of the birds shall be slaughtered in an earthen vessel over running water</i>. On this the Sages commented that the vessel must contain just enough water that the blood of the bird is discernible in it. And how much etc. (see text).</i> And how much is this? The fourth of a <i>log</i>.” Upon this the Sages queried: “If the bird was a large one so that the blood thereof ‘pushed away’ the water [so that it was imperceptible], or the bird was a small one so that its blood was ‘pushed away’ by the water [so that the blood was indiscernible], what is the ruling on these cases?” On these questions [the Rabbis of the Talmud] explained: “All standard measures laid down by the Sages were fixed with precision. The Sages estimated with reference to a ‘free bird’ that you will not find one so big that the blood thereof will ‘push away’ the water, nor will you find one so small that the blood thereof will be ‘pushed away’ by the water.” Now if all kinds of permissible birds were valid for [the purification of the leper], there are some birds the blood of which would “push away” many <i>logim</i> of water! Perhaps the Sages established the above standard only with reference to a “free bird” which one is commanded to bring if this is possible, according to the interpretation of Rabbi Yosei the Galilean,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See text of Ramban above, quoting the Torath Kohanim at Note 34.</i> [but if the purification has already been done with a large bird, it is also valid]. It has already been mentioned in the Gemara:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shebuoth 29 a.</i> “Perhaps he saw a large <i>tziporo</i> (bird) and he called it <i>gamal</i> (camel).”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This text clearly shows that the term <i>tzipor</i> includes also large birds, and hence the above-mentioned explanation that it refers only to small birds is incorrect.</i><br>The correct [and final] conclusion which emerges from all this discussion is that we say on the basis of this interpretation<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See text of Ramban above, quoting the Torath Kohanim at Note 34.</i> that any bird which is not a “free one” is invalid for the purification of the leper, even if the purification has already been done, since in the Mishnah thereof<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 5.</i> it was not taught: “It is a commandment [to be fulfilled if possible] that the birds should be ‘free birds,’ but even if they were not ‘free birds,’ they are valid,” as it taught concerning the requirement of equality [in appearance, size and value, that “even if they are not alike, they are valid”]; also, the correct conclusion is that all birds that are “free birds” are those that chatter. And that which the Rabbis said in the Torath Kohanim,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Metzora</i> 1:12.</i> “<i>Clean</i>, not those forbidden as food,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban’s meaning is as follows. On this exclusion of forbidden birds by the Torath Kohanim one might ask: “Since, as we have now established, the <i>dror</i>-characteristic of the bird is indispensable in the purification of the leper, meaning that if the birds did not have this quality of living in the house as well as in the field, the purification is invalid even if already done, why was it necessary for the Torath Kohanim to point to a special Scriptural source for the exclusion of forbidden birds; for such birds are not of the kind that live in the house as well as in the field, and we have said that if the birds lack this characteristic, the purification is invalid?” Ramban answers that we must perforce say that even among forbidden birds there <i>are</i> some species that do have this characteristic of being able to live in the house as well as in the field, and hence it was necessary for the Torath Kohanim to exclude them by means of a special expression in the verse.</i> is because even among the forbidden birds there are some species that possess this quality of <i>dror</i> [living in the house as well as in the field], such as the white-bellied swallow according to Rabbi Eliezer.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mentioned above in the text, at Note 38.</i> Or perhaps the meaning of the Torath Kohanim is that it excludes those birds [whose prohibition is not because they belong to the forbidden species, but because of special circumstances] which make them “forbidden to you,” such as those birds which are nonetheless forbidden [as food or benefit, because they belonged to a person of a city that had gone astray,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Deuteronomy 13:16-18, that all the belongings thereof are to be destroyed.</i> or those that have been exchanged for an idol],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus if one received birds of a permissible species as payment for an idol, they are nonetheless forbidden for <i>any</i> use, just as the original idol may not be made any use of.</i> or those which are <i>treifah</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Treifah</i> according to the accepted opinion (see Note 9 below), is an animal or bird suffering from one of certain organic diseases from which it is bound to die within twelve months, even though it be ritually slaughtered.

In the Agadah of the [Midrash] Rabbah we find this statement:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Vayikra Rabbah 16:7.</i> “Rabbi Yehudah the son of Rabbi Simon said: These birds [brought by the leper for his purification] are noisy ones, symbolic of he who speaks slander [and as a punishment for which, the slanderer is stricken with leprosy]. Said the Holy One, blessed be He, ‘Let that which is accompanied by sound [namely, these noisy birds] come to bring atonement for the evil sound [of the slanderer].’ And Rabbi Yehoshua the son of Levi said: The birds [brought by the leper for his purification] are of the ‘free kind’ [that live in the house as well as in the field] and thus ate of the leper’s bread and drank of his water. Now the following statement follows logically with stronger reason etc.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“If these birds that ate of his bread and drank of his water, effect atonement for the leper, how much more so do the priests who enjoy twenty-four kinds of gifts, effect atonement for Israel!” (<i>Ibid.</i>).</i>",
                    "AND CEDAR-WOOD, AND SCARLET, AND HYSSOP. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented that “[the cedar-wood and the hyssop] represent the tallest and the lowest in species of vegetation, as is evidenced by the words of wisdom of Solomon.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>And he</i> [Solomon] <i>spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall</i> (I Kings 5:13).

There the hyssop was required in the sprinkling of the blood upon the lintel and the two side-posts, so that the destroyer would not come into the Israelite houses. — Ibn Ezra is thus intimating that in the cases of leprosy and impurity of a corpse, the purification was a sign that the destroyer would no longer approach that person or house, just as was its function in Egypt (Ezra L’havin).</i> And the meaning of the expression <i>into the open field</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 7.</i> is to an uninhabitated place, so that no infection might be caused.” [Thus far are the words of Ibn Ezra.].<br>And in the Torath Kohanim the Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Metzora</i> 2:5.</i> “<i>Into the open field</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 7.</i> this means that he is not to stand in Joppa [which is on the sea] and let it go into the sea, nor is he to stand in Gabbath [a city which is on the edge of the desert] and let it go into the desert.” Now if so, [that he may not let it go into the sea or into the desert], then the reason why it is sent into the open field is like the secret of the goat sent to Azazel,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 16:10.</i> except that there it is sent <i>for Azazel into the wilderness</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 16:10.</i> and here it is sent to the flying [destructive spirits] of the field.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See my Hebrew commentary, p. 80.</i> I will yet explain this with the help of G-d.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 16:8.</i>"

This atonement is accomplished by means of the priest’s acts with the blood of the guilt-offering [as prescribed in Verse 14] and the oil [as set forth in Verses 15-18]. Similarly, the verse stating [in connection with a leper who is poor], <i>to make atonement for him before the Eternal</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">72</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 29.</i> [carries the same meaning]. And in the Torath Kohanim we find it said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">73</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Metzora</i> 3:12.</i> “<i>And the rest of the oil that is in the priest’s hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, and the priest shall make atonement</i>. ‘If he put [the rest of the oil upon his head], he effected atonement for him, and if he did not put it thereon, he did not effect atonement.’ These are the words of Rabbi Akiba. Rabbi Yochanan the son of Nuri said: ‘This is the <i>residue</i> of a commandment, [and therefore is not part of the commandment itself, and thus not indispensable]; whether he put it thereon or did not put it thereon, he has effected atonement.’” Now if so, according to the opinion of Rabbi Yochanan the son of Nuri, the expression <i>and the priest shall make atonement for him</i>, refers [only] to the guilt-offering [which <i>is</i> indispensable in the final purification of the leper].<br>Now Scripture states [here] in the case of the guilt-offering, <i>and the priest shall make atonement</i>, and then states again in the case of the sin-offering, <i>and he shall make atonement for him that is to be cleansed because of his uncleanness</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">74</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 19.</i> and with reference to the burnt-offering and meal-offering it also states, <i>and the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be clean</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">75</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 20.</i> But we do not know the purport of all these expressions of atonement. Perhaps the guilt-offering effects atonement for the trespass that he committed before he was affected by his plague, and the sin-offering effects atonement for his sin which he committed during the time of the plague.

The burnt-offering and meal-offering constitute a ransom for his soul, that he be worthy to be purified and return to his dwelling. Therefore He said, <i>and the priest shall make atonement for him, ‘and he shall be clean</i>.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">75</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 20.</i><br>Now in the Torath Kohanim it is stated:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">77</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Metzora</i> 3:13.</i> “<i>And the priest shall offer the sin-offering, and make atonement</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">74</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 19.</i> Why is this said?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">78</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., why does it say here, <i>and he shall make atonement</i>, when at the end of the section (in Verse 20) it concludes, <i>and the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be clean</i>?

Now this plague which came in the other stones and in the other mortar [which replaced the original ones], is not identical with the first plague which was there, [but is a different outbreak]. It is thus unlike the “breaking out” of the leprosy mentioned in the case of a person<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">84</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 13:12; 20.</i> and the spreading thereof, which mean that the plague returned to its former natural place, since the pus many times hides under the skin and retreats into the interior of the body, and afterwards it returns and spreads to the skin on its outside. Rather, the matter [of leprosy in a house] is as I have written in <i>Seder Ishah Ki Thazria</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">80</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 13:47.</i> that it is a plague and Divine intervention implying that <i>the evil spirit from G-d</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">85</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 16:16.</i> is in that place. And in the Torath Kohanim the Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">86</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Metzora</i> 7:1.</i> “<i>And if the plague come again, and break out in the house</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">87</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 43.</i> This is like saying, ‘That person has returned to his place.’” The meaning of the Sages is to state that the expression <i>‘u’parach’</i> (<i>and it break out</i>) mentioned here [in connection with leprosy in a house], does not mean “spreading out” as it does in the verse [dealing with leprosy of a man], <i>And if the leprosy ‘paro’ach tiphrach’</i> (<i>break out abroad</i>) <i>in the skin</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">88</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 13:12.</i> but here it denotes a [fresh] outbreak in that place just like the expression, <i>the rod of Aaron ‘parach’</i> (<i>was budded</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">89</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 17:23.</i> The comparison that the Rabbis drew [i.e., that this is like saying, “That person has returned to his place”], is to allude to the matter we have stated, namely, that this is not a plague which comes into existence and spreads out [as in the case of leprosy of man], but is one outbreak after another, just like a man who left his place and then came back to sit in his former place, on a different chair which was prepared for him there. I have already explained<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">80</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 13:47.</i> the meaning of this “breaking out” [of leprosy in a house], as well as of the “breaking out” of leprosy in garments.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">90</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 13:57.</i><br>Now Scripture does not state here, “and if the plague comes back, and breaks out ‘in those stones’” [but instead it says, <i>and breaks out ‘in the house’</i>],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">87</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 43.</i> for even if it broke out in another place of the house, and even if it was of another color, unlike that of the first plague, it is considered a recurring plague [i.e., one that recurs after removal of the stones, scraping and replastering, which necessitates the demolition of the house], and is not considered a plague appearing for the first time in the house. This is the sense of the expression <i>in the house</i> [<i>and if the plague come again, and break out ‘in the house’</i>],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">87</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 43.</i> meaning that wherever it recurs in the house, it is governed by that law [which requires the demolition of the house]. The reason for this is that the evil spirit will not depart from that house, but will always be in one of the places in that house, to frighten its owners. So also the Rabbis have said in the Torath Kohanim:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">91</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Metzora</i> 7:1; 3.</i> I know only that [the house is to be demolished] if the plague returns to its former place. Whence do I know to include a return to any place in the house? Scripture therefore says, <i>in the house</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">87</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 43.</i> I know only that this rule applies if the plague recurs in its original color. Whence do I know that even if it recurs in a different color [it is governed by the same rule]? Scripture therefore says, <i>and it break out</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">87</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 43.</i> [meaning, in its original color or a different one].<br>Now the meaning of these verses according to the interpretation [of the Torath Kohanim] is as follows. <i>And if the plague come again</i> on the seventh day and returns <i>in the house, after that the stones have been taken out, and after the house hath been scraped, and after it is plastered</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">87</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 43.</i> or<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">92</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The expression <i>u’va hakohein</i> of Verse 44, which is generally translated “<i>‘and’</i> the priest shall come,” Ramban interprets to mean “‘or’ the priest shall come.” See further, Note 95, on the significance of this interpretation.</i> <i>the priest shall come</i> a second time <i>and see, and, behold</i>, that now <i>the plague has recurred</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">93</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew word is <i>pasah</i>, which is generally translated as “spread.” But Ramban has already explained above that in this section dealing with leprosy of a house, the term means “recur” and not “spread.” See Note 95.</i> <i>in the house</i> as it was at first, <i>it is malignant leprosy … and he shall break down the house</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">94</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 45.</i> the two verses thus explaining that whether the plague recurred at the end of the first week or at the end of the second week, they are governed by one law [which requires the demolition of the house].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">95</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban thus avoids a great exegetical difficulty which Rashi found in these verses. Principally it is as follows: Verse 44 states: <i>And the priest shall come and see, and, behold, the plague be ‘pasah’ in the house, it is a malignant leprosy; it is unclean</i>. This is followed by Verse 45 which states: <i>And he shall break down the house</i> etc. Now Rashi, who interpreted the word <i>pasah</i> here in Verse 44 in the same way as in leprosy of man, meaning that “it spread out,” found this difficulty: since the Rabbis have said that every plague that recurs in a house after the removal of stones, scraping and replastering, is a sign of impurity, and requires the whole house to be demolished, why then does the verse state here <i>pasah</i>, since the same law applies even if the plague did not spread out? Accordingly Rashi transposed the order of the verses, placing Verse 45 [<i>And he shall break down the house …</i>] after Verse 43 [<i>And if the plague come again …</i>], and Verse 44 [<i>And the priest shall come …</i>] after Verses 46 and 47 [<i>and he that eateth in the house …</i>]. Ramban later remarks that this transposition of the verses is like “cutting the verses with a knife.” Ramban on the other hand explained the verses on these two premises: (a) the term <i>pasah</i> in this section on leprosy of a house, means “recur,” and not “spread.” (b) <i>‘u’va hakohein’</i> in Verse 44 does not mean “<i>then</i> the priest shall come,” or “<i>and</i> the priest shall come,” but rather “<i>or</i> the priest shall come.” Thus Verse 43 speaks of the recurrence of the plague at the end of the <i>first</i> week [after the removal of the stones etc.], and Verse 44 speaks of the case when it recurred at the end of the <i>second</i> week. In each of these cases the law is as stated in Verse 45: <i>And he shall break down the house …</i> Thus according to Ramban all the verses are in order. The text of Ramban which follows sets forth this exposition in more detail.</i> Scripture did not need to say [in Verse 44] “<i>and the priest shall come and see, if the plague be ‘pasah’</i> (<i>have recurred</i>) <i>in the house</i> — he shall then command that they take out the stones” etc., [as Rashi would have it],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since Rashi explained the word <i>pasah</i> as “spreading,” he was also forced — besides transposing Verse 44 [<i>And the priest shall come and see …</i>] to follow after Verse 47 as mentioned above — to explain that if at the end of the second week after the house was shut up, the priest found that the plague has spread then Verse 40 (!) reapplies: <i>then the priest shall command that they take out the stones …</i> and he gives it another week. If it returns, he demolishes the house, and if it does not return, it is pure. [[illegible]] It is this re-introduction of Verse 40 here in the order of the verses that Ramban finds unnecessary, as explained in the text.</i> for this verse [<i>and the priest shall come …</i>] is connected with the verse [43] immediately preceding it, stating, <i>if the plague come again … after that the stones have been taken out</i> at the end of the first week or the second week, when the priest comes, and he sees its recurrence, <i>it is a malignant leprosy</i>. Then Scripture further states, <i>And if the priest shall come in</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">97</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 48.</i> that is, at the end of the second week mentioned above [in Verse 44], <i>and see it, and, behold, the plague hath not recurred</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">98</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here too (in Verse 48) the word is <i>pasah</i>, which Rashi would explain as “spread” or “extended” [and it is so rendered in most translations], but Ramban explains it as meaning “recur.”</i> <i>in the house, after that the house was plastered; then the priest shall pronounce the house clean</i>, since it is healed of the plague, that is to say, it did not recur. Thus we now derive the principle that if a plague remained as it was during the first week and the second week, he removes the stones, scrapes away and replasters, and gives it another week, and if the plague returns, he demolishes the house. This is the correct interpretation of the verses in accordance with the [Rabbinical] interpretation thereof, for it is impossible to cut them, so to say, with a knife<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">99</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Reference is to Rashi’s exposition of the verses. See above, Note 95.</i> placing later verses first and earlier verses later, in a manner which is not all their meaning.<br>It is further possible that we say as a correct interpretation of the verses on this subject, that the term <i>pasah</i> in this section [which deals with leprosy in a house], is like <i>parach</i>, both of them being an expression of “sprouting.” Where a plague exists already, the term <i>pasah</i> denotes its growth and extension, and where there is no plague, it means its [original] sprouting and [subsequent] recurrence, since it is all a matter of growth. Onkelos also has rendered all [expressions of <i>pasah</i>] as <i>oseiph</i> (adding), and the term <i>tosepheth</i> (addition) is used of a growing thing which is added to another, such as in the expressions: <i>‘v’nosaph gam hu’</i> (<i>they be added also</i>) <i>to our enemies;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">100</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 1:10.</i> <i>‘v’nosphah nachalathan’</i> (<i>then will their inheritance be added</i>),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">101</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 36:4.</i> and it may also be used of a matter which “returns,” such as: <i>the Eternal ‘yosiph’</i> (<i>will set again</i>) <i>His hand;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">102</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 11:11.</i> <i>and they prophesied ‘v’lo yasaphu’</i> (<i>but they did so no more</i>),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">103</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 11:25.</i> meaning that [Eldad and Meidad] did not prophesy any more. Thus the meaning of the term <i>pasah</i> is that the plague “returned.” Now after the removing of the stones, [scraping and replastering], when Scripture speaks of <i>pisayon</i> [as it does in Verse 44 and 48], the meaning thereof is “sprouting,” as I have mentioned in connection with the term <i>prichah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">104</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the beginning of this verse, in the text before Note 88.</i> If so, Scripture is stating: <i>and if the plague came again and ‘sprouted’ in the house, after that the stones have been taken out … and the priest shall come and see, and, behold the plague has ‘sprouted’ in the house … then he shall break down the house</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">105</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verses 43-45.</i> for every plague that returns is a sign of confirmed impurity. <i>And if the priest shall come in, and see that the plague has not ‘sprouted’</i> at all <i>in the house, after the house was plastered</i>, he shall pronounce it pure, <i>because the plague has been healed</i> by the removal of the stones, [scraping] and replastering.<br>Thus the law of a house wherein the plague recurs at the end of the first week has been explained here, that he removes the stones, scrapes and replasters, and gives it another week. If the plague returns the house is impure [and is to be demolished], and if it does not return it is pure. But where it remained at the end of the first week as it was [when he first saw it], and it recurred at the end of the second week, the law thereof was not explained in the Torah, but we derive it by means of a <i>gzeirah shavah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">106</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “a similarity of phrases.” It is one of the Thirteen principles of exegesis established by Rabbi Yishmael, by which the Torah is expounded (see above, Note 64).

It is important to note in this connection that an analogy from such congruent expressions cannot be established of one’s own accord; it must be an authorized tradition that this similarity of phrases is to be applied, in order to establish such an analogy.</i> as follows: [the expression, <i>and behold if the plague recur</i> is found both in Verse 44: <i>and the priest shall come</i>, and in Verse 39: <i>and the priest shall return</i>, thus establishing that] “<i>coming</i> [in Verse 44] and <i>returning</i> [in Verse 39] are identical in regard to their law,” meaning that the law of “coming” which is stated at the end of the second week, is like the law of “returning” stated at the end of the first week, i.e., that in both cases if the plague recurred, he removes the stones, scrapes and replasters and gives it another week.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">107</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is clearly stated in Verse 40 with regard to the end of the first week. The above analogy establishes that the same law applies to the end of the second week, although it is not clearly specified.</i> Similarly, if the plague remained as it was [at the end of] the first and second weeks, and recurred [at the end of] the third week, the law thereof is not mentioned in the Torah, but it is derived by means of another <i>gzeirah shavah:</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">106</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “a similarity of phrases.” It is one of the Thirteen principles of exegesis established by Rabbi Yishmael, by which the Torah is expounded (see above, Note 64).

See also above, Note 98.</i> Leave it.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">113</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., “This is not the proper place of the verse, since that verse speaks of the case of a plague that remained as it was during the first week, to which the priest has therefore given a second week to be shut up, and at the end of the second week he comes and sees that it has spread.” See above, Note 96, that Rashi transposed Verse 44 and read it after Verse 47. This is all predicated upon the interpretation of the term <i>pasah</i> as meaning “spreading” or “extending.” The phrase in the Torath Kohanim <i>hanach lo</i> (“Leave it”) is therefore interpreted as explained above [on the basis of the Rabad’s commentary there, which follows Rashi’s interpretation]. Ramban who has explained the term differently, as explained above in the text, is therefore bound to give a different interpretation of the expression in the Torath Kohanim, which now follows in the text: “That is to say, that we are to leave etc.”</i> That is to say, we are to leave here the plain meaning of the verse and follow the interpretation, but not that we are to uproot the verse from its place and explain it as referring to another place. This is what appears to me to be correct in the meaning of this Scriptural section, so that the words of the Sages be upheld, and it is a fitting and appealing interpretation."

This is as if the verse had said, “and whomsoever he that hath the issue toucheth with his hands, and he hath not yet bathed himself in water on the day of his purification, he shall wash his clothes, [and be impure until the even].” Scripture had to use the term “rinsing,” in order to teach that the “bathing” it mentioned in the verse, <i>and he shall bathe his flesh in running water</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">125</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 13.</i> should be by means of rinsing and rubbing, so as to remove anything interposing [between the water and his body], as I have explained.

The reason [for their being lenient in the case of the impurity of a <i>zavah</i>] is because it was not necessary for Scripture to mention at all the expression, <i>and after that she shall be clean</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">141</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 28.</i> since the woman is included in the law of the man, and the verses were only necessary to mention the difference between a <i>zav</i> and <i>zavah</i>, that her flux must be of blood [and not white], and to distinguish between a flux in her regular period and outside the regular period. Therefore the Rabbis were of the opinion that [in the above phrase, <i>and after that she shall be clean</i>] Scripture intended to include an additional form of purification for her, saying, <i>and after that she shall be clean</i> like all those mentioned in the Torah, who are purified even without running water.<br>Acharei Moth"

                    "AND THE ETERNAL SPOKE UNTO MOSES, AFTER THE DEATH OF THE TWO SONS OF AARON. The meaning of the phrase <i>after the death of the two sons of Aaron</i>, is that immediately after the death of his sons He had warned Aaron against [drinking] wine or strong drink [when going into the Tent of Meeting], so that he should not die,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 10:9.</i> and now He told Moses in addition to warn him so that he should not die when he draws near the Eternal [even in a sober condition, but at a time when he is not commanded to do so].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban’s intent is thus to explain that we should not think that this section was made known to Moses immediately after the death of Aaron’s two sons, since the prohibition conveyed to Aaron against the ministering priests’ drinking wine, preceded it. The reason why Ramban finds this important to emphasize will be made clear further on. See Note 5.</i> It is likely that these two commandments were both conveyed on the day after the death of Aaron’s sons, for on the actual day [when the deaths occurred, Aaron] was a mourner, and the holy spirit does not rest upon man in moments of sadness,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yerushalmi Succah V, 1. And therefore G-d would not have communicated with Aaron on that day.</i> and the communication concerning the prohibition against wine came to Aaron,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 10:8. Thus it must have been on the day after the day of the tragedy, when he was no longer a mourner.</i> and in that selfsame day this commandment [stated in the section before us] was also told to Moses.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We may now understand why Ramban emphasized that the phrase <i>after the death of the two sons of Aaron</i> does not mean immediately after their death, since it was preceded by G-d’s command to Aaron. For had the phrase meant “immediately following their death,” then it would have been possible that this command came to Moses on the day of the death of Aaron’s sons. But now that the Divine command to Aaron preceded it, and that could not have taken place on the day of the tragedy [for the reason explained in the text], but only on the following day, it follows that the Divine command given to Moses, as contained in this section, was also communicated to him on the day after the death of Aaron’s sons. Ramban’s stressing of this is obviously intended to take exception to what Chizkuni clearly writes in his commentary, that it was on the selfsame day that the death occurred that the command contained in this section was communicated. On this Ramban commented: “The holy spirit does not rest upon man in moments of sadness.”</i> Scripture, however, preceded the prohibitions with which He warned Israel <i>that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile My Tabernacle that is in the midst of them</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 15:31. “And incidentally He explained already all the laws of impurity” (Tur).</i> [before dealing with the commands specific to Aaron], and only afterwards He wrote the warning [applying to] the individual [i.e., this section, which was to be conveyed by Moses to Aaron, as the verse states: <i>And the Eternal said unto Moses:</i> ‘<i>Speak unto Aaron thy brother</i> etc.’].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 2.</i> But in my opinion the whole Torah is written in consecutive order, and in all places where He changed the order, placing an earlier event in a later position, Scripture clearly states so, such as the verses: <i>And the Eternal spoke unto Moses in Mount Sinai</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 25:1.</i> [later on] in this book, [the laws of which were declared to Moses in the Tent of Meeting]; <i>And it came to pass on the day that Moses had made an end of setting up the Tabernacle</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 7:1.</i> in the following book [i.e., the Book of Numbers], and similar such statements. Therefore Scripture stated here <i>after the death</i>, in order to inform us that this [communication] was [given to Moses] immediately after the death of the two sons of Aaron [and according to the historical sequence of events, it should have been placed in Chapter 10 above, where the account of events following their death is given].<br>And in the opinion of our Rabbis who said<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, beginning of <i>Acharei Moth</i>, 3. Quoted also in Rashi.</i> [by way of a parable, that this verse can be compared to the case of a physician who warned his patient not to eat cold things or sleep in a damp place, and another physician warned him likewise but added]: “so that you should not die as that person died;” thus “this [second physician] put him on his guard more than the first one,” [according to this comment of the Rabbis] the meaning of the verse will be, that G-d said to Moses these words: “<i>After the death of the two sons of Aaron</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus the expression <i>after the death</i> is not a chronological note marking the occasion when this communication was given, but constitutes part of the Divine words, as if to say: “Now that the death of Aaron’s sons happened because they drew near etc., therefore speak to Aaron etc.”</i> <i>when they drew near before the Eternal</i>, speak to him <i>that he come not at all times into the holy place … that he die not</i>.”"

                    "SPEAK UNTO AARON THY BROTHER. The meaning of the epithet <i>thy brother</i> is that “you are to warn him because he is your brother, for even though you are not under this prohibition against coming [into the holy place at all times, thus you might think that Aaron, too, is not subject to this restriction, since he is your brother, nonetheless] Aaron, your brother, <i>is</i> under the prohibition against coming [into the holy place at all times].”<br>Now Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented that this Scriptural section indicates that Aaron’s sons [died because they] brought the fire of incense into the innermost part of the Sanctuary.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the Holy of Holies. This explains, according to Ibn Ezra, why He mentioned here the death of Aaron’s sons, and then followed it up with the admonition against the priests entering at all times <i>into the holy place within the Veil</i> (M’kor Chayim).</i> But in my opinion this is not correct. For the verses which mention their sin always say, <i>when they offered ‘strange’ fire before the Eternal</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 3:4. <i>Ibid.</i>, 26:61.</i> And if [you accept as] proof that they entered into the innermost part of the Sanctuary, the prohibition with which G-d warned Moses concerning their father [i.e., Aaron], so that he die not [as Ibn Ezra said], then [you should] certainly accept as proof [that they died because] they entered the Sanctuary whilst intoxicated by wine, the prohibition that was said to Aaron himself immediately after their death, [<i>Drink no wine nor strong drink</i> etc.]!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 10:9.</i> Moreover, how could it have occurred to them to enter on that day the [innermost] part [of the Sanctuary] which [even] their father did not enter, for Aaron burnt the incense on the “inner” altar [which stood in the Sanctuary proper], and why should they bring in their incense to a place further inside [the Sanctuary] than their father! Now I have already hinted at the nature of their sin,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 10:2.</i> and the language of the verses point thereto. But the expression <i>‘b’korvatham’</i> (when they approached) [does not mean, as Ibn Ezra interpreted it, “<i>when they approached</i> by entering the innermost part of the holy place”, but] according to its plain meaning is like the expression <i>‘uv’korvatham’</i> (<i>and when they come near</i>) <i>to the altar</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 40:32.</i> <i>to minister</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Or when they come near to the altar to minister</i> (<i>ibid.</i>, 30:20).</i> Thus the verse here is stating that Aaron’s sons died when they ministered before G-d. If so, [the sense of the warning here] is that He warned Aaron that he should only minister in the place which He commands [that it be done], and at the time He specifies for it.<br>It is possible that the sense of the verse is similar to that which our Rabbis have said,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mechilta, <i>Beshalach Vayasa</i> 6. See also Rashi, Numbers 17:13.</i> that the people were speaking perversely of the incense, saying, “Through it Nadab and Abihu [Aaron’s sons] died etc.” Therefore Scripture stated that <i>after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they drew near before the Eternal</i> with the incense, He said to Aaron that he should come even nearer before the Eternal than they did, and <i>with</i> incense, for if he comes into the holy place [i.e., the Holy of Holies] <i>without</i> the incense, he will die, for with it he shall enter there first, just as He said, <i>and he shall bring it within the Veil … and the cloud of the incense will cover the ark-cover that is upon the testimony, that he die not</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verses 12-13. According to tradition the High Priest first entered the Holy of Holies, and then put the incense upon the censer containing the coals of fire from the altar that stood in the outside Court. This Service, as will be explained further on, was done only on the Day of Atonement.</i> This then is the meaning of the phrase [here in Verse 2 before us], <i>for I will appear in the cloud upon the ark-cover</i>, meaning that he [Aaron now, and the High Priest in succeeding generations] is only to enter there with the incense whose cloud rises up there [upon the ark-cover], even as He said, <i>and the cloud of the incense will cover the ark-cover</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 13. Thus it will be shown that it is not the incense which brings death, for here Aaron went into the Sanctuary even further than his sons did, and he was protected by the incense. People will thus conclude that it is sin that brings death, and not the incense. This is clearly the trend of Ramban’s thought.</i>",

                    "HE SHALL PUT ON THE LINEN TUNIC OF ‘KODESH’ (HOLINESS). “This means that they [i.e., all the garments of the High Priest] must be of the Sanctuary [treasury, and not of his own possession].” This is Rashi’s language.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi thus interprets the verse to mean: “he shall put on the linen tunic of the Sanctuary.” Ramban will later suggest that by way of the simple meaning of Scripture, the phrase means that “he shall put on ‘the holy’ linen tunic.” It is so rendered in the J.P.S. translation.</i> Thus the following phrase which states, <i>they are garments of ‘kodesh’</i> (<i>holiness</i>) must therefore mean that all the garments [even those of the ordinary priests], must come from the Sanctuary [treasury]. And [so] it is stated in the Torath Kohanim:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Acharei</i> 1:10.</i> “<i>‘Kodesh yilbash’</i> (‘He shall put on’ the linen tunic ‘of holiness’), this means that these [garments of the High Priest] are to be of the Sanctuary. From this phrase I would only know concerning these garments [i.e., the four garments worn by the High Priest when he ministered in the Holy of Holies on the Day of Atonement]. Whence do I know to include the other garments of the High Priest [i.e., the eight golden garments in which he officiated throughout the year], and the garments of his brethren the priests [that they too must all come from the Temple treasury]? Scripture therefore says, <i>they are garments of ‘kodesh’</i> (<i>holiness</i>). It is a conclusion by analogy that all garments [worn by all priests] should be of the Temple treasury” [since they all come under the term <i>‘garments of holiness’</i>].<br>By way of the simple meaning of Scripture, just as He said, <i>and they shall make holy garments for Aaron thy brother</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 28:4.</i> referring to the eight [golden] garments, He states that these [four garments worn by the High Priest on the Day of Atonement] are also holy garments. Their secret is analogous to <i>the man clothed in linen</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 9:11. The symbol there is that G-d will not destroy His people, but that He will deal with them in mercy (Abusaula).</i> and therefore He informed him that <i>they are holy garments</i>. And in Vayikra Rabbah the Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Vayikra Rabbah 21:10.</i> “As the Service performed Above, so is the Service below. Just as of the Service Above it is said, <i>one man in the midst of them clothed in linen</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 9:2.</i> so of the Service below it is said, <i>he shall put on the holy linen tunic</i>.",
                    "HE SHALL PUT ON … HE SHALL BE GIRDED … HE SHALL BE ATTIRED.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse reads: <i>‘He shall put on’ the holy linen tunic, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and ‘he shall be girded’ with the linen belt, and with the linen mitre ‘he shall be attired.’</i> The use of the multiple verbs will be explained in the following text from the Torath Kohanim.</i> [The Scriptural use of these multiple expressions is] explained by the Torath Kohanim:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Acharei</i> 1:14.</i> “Since we are finally bound to include [among the requirements for the Service on the Day of Atonement] another set of [four linen] garments [when he brought out the spoon and censer from the Holy of Holies] in the afternoon of that day, then I might think that if he has no other set of garments he should not put on those he wore in the morning [when he first entered the Holy of Holies]. Scripture therefore says <i>he shall put on … he shall be girded … he shall be attired</i>” [thus indicating by the multiple use of these expressions that the High Priest may wear these vestments again in the afternoon].<br>Now Rashi commented: “<i>‘Yitznoph’</i> (<i>he shall be attired</i>). [The word is to be understood as the Targum rendered it:] <i>yocheith b’reishei</i> which means “he shall ‘place’ it upon his head.” This is like <i>‘vatanach’ his garment by her</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 39:16.</i> which the Targum rendered ‘<i>v’achthethei</i>,” meaning “and she ‘placed’ [his garment by her].” But Onkelos’ opinion [in translating the Hebrew word <i>yitznoph</i> as “placing”] is not clear to me, for the term <i>tzniphah</i> means “winding” [something] around the head like a turban,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ramban, Exodus 28:31. (Vol. II, pp. 486-7).</i> so why did he translate it merely as “placing,” and did not render it by an [Aramaic] word which is used specifically for actual “winding”? Perhaps there is no equivalent expression for it in the Aramaic language, for even the expression in [the Book of] Isaiah, <i>‘hatzniphoth’ and the mantles</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 3:23. <i>Tzniphoth</i> is translated “turbans.”</i> Yonathan ben Uziel rendered <i>kitoraya</i> (“crownings” surrounding the head). Thus both [Onkelos and Yonathan] had no Aramaic equivalent for <i>tzniph</i> [in the Book of Isaiah] <i>and mitznepheth</i> [in the Torah — Exodus 28:4], and therefore both of them used the same term derived from the Sacred Language — <i>mitznephta</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus the Hebrew <i>mitznepheth</i> [in Exodus 28:4] is rendered both by Onkelos and Yonathan as <i>mitznephta</i>, which is basically the same Hebrew word as <i>mitznepheth</i>, since they had no Aramaic word for it.</i>"

See Vol. II, p. 84, Note 139.</i> ‘Although it is [only] with reference to the goat of the sin-offering that it is written [explicitly] that it was <i>for the Eternal</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As it is stated in the verse before us: <i>one lot for the Eternal, and the other for Azazel</i>, and in the following verse it is stated that <i>the goat upon which the lot fell for the Eternal</i> be offered <i>for a sin-offering</i>.</i> the goat which was sent away [to Azazel] was also for the Eternal.’ But there is no need for this [comment]. For the goat which was sent away was not an “offering’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., “it was unlike all other offerings” (Ohel Yoseph).</i> since it was not slaughtered. Now if you can understand the secret of the word after ‘Azazel,’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Verse 10 it states <i>‘la’azazel hamidbarah’</i> (<i>for Azazel into the wilderness</i>). The secret is thus that this is the desert’s portion.</i> you will know its secret [that of Azazel] and the secret of its name,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“For the name [Azazel] is derived from the word <i>az</i> (strong), which is indicative of the nature of the offering befitting him, and of the strength and might which are in his power” (Peirush Mototh on Ibn Ezra).</i> since it has companions in Scripture.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., in the purification of the leper (above, 14:7) and of a house afflicted by leprosy (<i>ibid.</i>, Verse 53). See Ramban <i>ibid.</i>, Verse 53.</i> And I will reveal to you part of the secret by hint: when you will be at thirty-three<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This enigmatic text in Ibn Ezra is generally explained by his commentators [and is so clearly indicated further, by Ramban] as follows: If from the word Azazel [here in Verse 8] you will count ahead thirty-three verses, you will reach Chapter 17, Verse 7, which reads <i>And they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices unto the satyrs, after whom they go astray</i>. Here then is the secret of why the goat that was sent away to Azazel was not slaughtered, so that it should not appear as a form of sacrifice to the satyrs (Ohel Yoseph). See my Hebrew commentary, p. 88.</i> you will know it.” [Thus far are the words of Ibn Ezra]. Now of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra it may be said that <i>he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth a matter</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 11:13.</i> and I will not be <i>the talebearer who revealeth</i> his secret,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The above verse reads: <i>He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets; but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth a matter</i>. Ramban thus after paying tribute to Ibn Ezra for remaining faithful to the spirit of the second half of the verse, now says that nor will he himself be in violation of the first half of the verse, since the Sages have already revealed that secret in many places.</i> since our Rabbis of blessed memory have already revealed it in many places. Thus they have said in Bereshith Rabbah:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Bereshith Rabbah 65:10.</i> “<i>And the ‘sa’ir’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">64</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “the goat.” But this Hebrew term <i>sa’ir</i> was also used by Scripture with reference to Esau [as the text continues], in the sense of “hairy.”</i> <i>shall carry upon him</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 22.</i> this is a reference to Esau, as it is said, <i>Behold, Esau my brother is a man who is ‘sa’ir’</i> (<i>hairy</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 27:11.</i> <i>All ‘avonotham’</i> (<i>their iniquities</i>),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 22.</i> [read]: <i>‘avonoth tam’</i> (the sins of him who has been called <i>tam</i>, ‘a man of integrity’), as it is said, <i>and Jacob was a man ‘tam’</i> (‘of integrity’).”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">67</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 25:27.</i> It is explained more clearly in the Chapters of the great Rabbi Eliezer:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Pirkei d’Rabbi Eliezer, Chapter 46.</i> “The reason why<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is in connection with what is told in the Pirkei d’Rabbi Eliezer, that “on the day the Torah was given to Israel, Satan said before the Holy One, blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, you have given me control over all the wicked, but over the righteous You have not given me control!’ To this the Holy One, blessed be He, replied: ‘You will have control over them on the Day of Atonement if they have sinned, and if not, you will have no control over them.’” Therefore etc.</i> they would give Sammael [i.e., Satan] a conciliatory gift on the Day of Atonement, was so that he should not annul [the effect of] their offerings, as it is said, <i>one lot for the Eternal, and the other lot for Azazel</i>, the lot of the Holy One, blessed by He, to be a burnt-offering,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In view of the fact that the goat for the Eternal was offered as a sin-offering [as stated in Verse 9]. Rabbi David Luria in his commentary to the Pirkei d’Rabbi Eliezer, emends the text to read: “the lot of the Holy One, blessed be He, to be <i>a sin-offering</i>.” It would seem, however, that Ramban calls it a “burnt-offering” because although it was technically <i>a sin-offering</i>, it was completely burnt as is a burnt-offering (further, Verse 27) and not eaten as is a sin-offering.</i> and the lot of Azazel to be ‘the goat of sin,’ bearing upon it all the iniquities of Israel, as it is said, <i>And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 22.</i> When Sammael saw that he could find no sin on the Day of Atonement amongst them [the children of Israel], he said to the Holy One, blessed by He: ‘Master of all worlds! You have one people on earth who are comparable to the ministering angels in the heavens. Just as the ministering angels are barefooted, so are the Israelites barefooted [i.e., do not wear leather shoes] on the Day of Atonement. Just as the ministering angels do not eat or drink, so is there no eating or drinking in Israel on the Day of Atonement. Just as the ministering angels have no joints [in their feet, and therefore cannot sit or lie down], so do the Israelites stand on their feet on the Day of Atonement.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">72</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This would seem to be a reference to the Sanctuary, where the Service on the Day of Atonement lasted continuously for almost the whole day, and since it was not permitted to sit in the Sanctuary Court, the people who were there had to stand on their feet the whole day (Rabbi David Luria). Based on this text the custom has spread among devout Jews to stand on their feet during the whole Day of Atonement (see Shulchan Aruch, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 619:5).</i> Just as there is peace in the midst of the ministering angels, so do the Israelites bring peace among themselves on the Day of Atonement. Just as the ministering angels are free from all sin, so are the Israelites free from all sin on the Day of Atonement.’ And the Holy One, blessed be He, hears the testimony concerning Israel from their prosecutor, and He atones for the altar and for the Sanctuary, <i>and for the priests and for all the people of the assembly</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">73</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 33.</i> as it is said, <i>And he shall make atonement for the most holy place</i> etc.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">73</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 33.</i> Thus far is the language of this Agadah (tradition) in which the Rabbis have informed us of his name [i.e., Sammael] and the nature of his deeds.<br>Now this is the secret of the matter. They used to worship “other gods,” namely, the angels, bringing offerings of a sweet savor to them, similarly to that which it says, <i>and thou didst set Mine oil and My incense before them. My bread also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou didst even set it before them for a sweet savor, and thus it was; saith the Eternal G-d</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">74</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 16:18-19.</i> You have to contemplate the Scriptural text as it is written and [also] as [it is read according to the] Masoretic tradition.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">75</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to the Masorah we read in the above first verse: <i>nathat</i> (<i>‘thou’ didst set Mine oil</i> …), but the Hebrew word is actually written with a letter <i>yod</i> at the end, which suggests the reading <i>nathati</i>, meaning: “and ‘I’ did set Mine oil and Mine incense before them for your sake; that is to say, the offering which you brought before Me, it is I who gave it to them,” (Abusuala), as will be explained further on in the text. The same applies to the following verse where the Hebrew word is read <i>unethatha</i> (<i>‘thou’ didst even set it</i>), but it is actually written with a letter <i>yod: unethati</i>, meaning, “and I did set it …” (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> Now the Torah has absolutely forbidden to accept them as deities, or to worship them in any manner. However, the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded us that on the Day of Atonement we should let loose a goat in the wilderness, to that “prince” [power] which rules over wastelands, and this [goat] is fitting for it because he is its master, and destruction and waste emanate from that power, which in turn is the cause of the stars of the sword, wars, quarrels, wounds, plagues, division and destruction. In short, it is the spirit of the sphere of Mars, and its portion among the nations is Esau [Rome], the people that inherited the sword and the wars, and among animals [its portion consists of] the <i>se’irim</i> (demons) and the goats. Also in its portion are the devils called “destroyers” in the language of our Rabbis, and in the language of Scripture: <i>se’irim</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">76</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 17:7.</i> (satyrs, demons), for thus he [i.e., Esau] and his nation were called <i>sa’ir</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">77</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 27:11. Numbers 24:18.</i> Now the intention in our sending away the goat to the desert was not that it should be an offering from us to it — Heaven forbid! Rather, our intention should be to fulfill the wish of our Creator, Who commanded us to do so. This may be compared to the case of someone who makes a feast for his master, and the master commands the person making the feast, “Give one portion to that servant of mine,” in which case the host gives nothing [of his own] to that servant, and it is not to show him honor that he acts in that way to him, but everything is given to the master and it is the master that gives a gift to his servant; the host only observes his command and does in honor of the master whatever he commanded him to do. The master, however, out of his own compassion for the host, wanted all his servants to derive some enjoyment from it [the feast], in order that they may all speak of his [the host’s] praise and not of his shortcomings.<br>This then is the reason [for having someone] who casts the lots [on the two goats]. If the priest were to dedicate them merely, by word of mouth [without casting the lots], saying, “one for the Eternal” and “one for Azazel,” that would be like worshipping [Azazel] or taking a vow in its name.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">78</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 60 b: “He who makes a vow in the name of an idol, transgresses a negative commandment,” i.e., <i>and make no mention of the name of other gods</i> (Exodus 23:13, Rashi). Ramban’s thought is thus clear. If the priest were to dedicate the two goats by word of mouth, without the casting of lots, that would be as if he was worshipping Azazel, a deed which is punishable by death, and in addition it would be making a vow in the name of an idol, which is also prohibited under penalty of whipping. In either case, then, he would be doing something which the Torah has prohibited.</i> Rather, the priest <i>set</i> the two goats <i>before the Eternal at the door of the Tent of Meeting</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">79</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 7.</i> for both of them were a gift to G-d, and he gave to His servant that portion which came to him from G-d. It is he [i.e., the priest] who cast the lots on them, but it is His hand that apportioned them, something like that which it says, <i>The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing of it is of the Eternal</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">80</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 16:33.</i> Even after the casting of the lots, the priest placed the two goats <i>before the Eternal</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">81</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 10.</i> thus proclaiming that both are His and that by sending one away [to the desert] we intend merely to fulfill G-d’s wish, just as it said, <i>And the goat, on which the lot fell for Azazel, shall be set alive ‘before the Eternal,’ to make atonement over him, to send him away</i> etc.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">81</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 10.</i> That is the reason why we do not ourselves do any act of slaughtering [of that goat, as this would imply that it is a proper offering which requires slaughtering]. And Onkelos rendered the expression (<i>one lot for the Eternal, and one lot for Azazel</i>) as: “one lot for ‘the Name of’ the Eternal and one lot for Azazel;” [thus he was careful not to translate “and one lot <i>for the name of</i> Azazel”], because the one was “for the Name of the Eternal” and not for him [Azazel], and the second was “for Azazel” but not “for the name of Azazel.”<br>It is for this reason that our Rabbis have interpreted:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">82</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Acharei</i> 13:10. See also Yoma 67 b.</i> “<i>And My statutes shall ye keep</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">83</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 18:4.</i> These are matters against which the evil inclination raises accusations, and the idolaters likewise bring charges, such as the [prohibition against] wearing clothes made of a mixture of wool and linen, [the law of] the Red Heifer, and of the goat that is sent away [to Azazel].” Now these idolaters have not accused us [according to our Rabbis] in connection with the offerings, for these are <i>the fire-offerings unto the Eternal</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">84</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 4:35; 5:12.</i> But they accuse us in connection with the goat that is sent away [to Azazel], because they think that we act as they do. Similarly they accuse us in connection with the Red Heifer, because it is slaughtered <i>without the camp</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">85</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Number 19:3.</i> but [in truth] the purport thereof is analogous to that of the goat sent away [to Azazel], which is to remove the spirit of impurity, as it is said of the future, <i>And also I will cause the</i> [false] <i>prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the Land</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">86</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zechariah 13:2. That the reference is to the “false” prophets is clearly stated in Yonathan ben Uziel’s rendition of the verse.</i> On this basis you will understand the reason why the person who sent forth the goat to Azazel must wash his garments [as they were rendered impure],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">87</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 26.</i> and likewise he who burns the Red Heifer,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">88</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 19:8.</i> and what our Rabbis have mentioned<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">89</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zebachim 83 a. See my Hebrew commentary p. 90.</i> concerning the requirement of washing the garments [of those priests who are in charge] of the burning of the bulls and he-goats which were to be wholly burnt [outside the camp, i.e., outside the city of Jerusalem].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">90</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 4:1-12; 13-21. Numbers 15:24. See also Ramban above, 4:2 (towards end: “He did not mention here etc.”)</i> Thus Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra intimated to you that you will know the secret of [sending away the goat to Azazel] when you reach the verse, <i>And they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices unto the satyrs</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">91</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 17:7. See above, Note 60.</i> The word [Azazel] is a compound one [made of two words].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">92</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Eiz</i> (the goat) and <i>azal</i> (going). It is the place to which “the goat goes.” So clearly explained by Rabbeinu Bachya (in my edition, II p. 499), and so found also in R’dak’s Sefer Hashorashim under root <i>eiz</i>.</i> There are many such cases. Thus the matter is explained, unless you pursue a further investigation from this subject to that of the Separate Intelligences<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">93</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Generally referring to the angels and spheres.

I cannot explain more, for I would have to close the mouths of those who claim to be wise in the study of nature, following after that Greek [philosopher Aristotle] who denied everything except that which could be perceived by him [through the physical senses], and he, and his wicked disciples, were so proud as to suspect<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">95</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Suspect.” In some books: “think.”</i> that whatever he could not conceive of through his reasoning is not true!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The attitude of these philosophers, who claimed that whatever their minds could not understand was untrue, was especially obnoxious to Ramban. History has fully borne him out on this matter, for there are literally myriads of matters which the Medieval scholastics, conditioned as they were by Aristotelian concepts of the universe, considered impossible, and are now proven facts. And who can foretell the future of our present-day concepts of the universe? There are obviously facts which lie beyond the present-day grasp of the human mind, which will some day become firmly established. To deny their possibility just because we do not understand them, was to Ramban a manifestation of arrogance.</i>"

This teaches that they are each a separate act of atonement.

Such an expression is not used with reference to the bullock of Aaron [over which he confessed his own sins and those of the other priests], nor in relation to the goat of the sin-offering of the Eternal, nor regarding the leaning of hands upon any of the offerings. This is because all offerings were brought for acceptance <i>upon the fires of G-d</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">84</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 4:35; 5:12.</i> [which burnt on the altar], and thus they effected pardon and atonement. But this [goat that was sent away to Azazel], since it was not for G-d, and the recipient thereof [i.e. Sammael] has no power to offer atonement or pardon, therefore the goat merely carries the people’s sins away, and [the accusing angel] must answer “Amen” against his will.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">105</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ramban above, Verse 8 [in connection with the quote from the Pirkei d’Rabbi Eliezer about Sammael]. The particular expression of Ramban here is based upon a Rabbinic tradition (Shabbath 119 b) that two ministering angels, one good and one bad, accompany a person on the eve of the Sabbath on his way from the synagogue to his home. If the house is in order, the light is kindled, and peace reigns throughout, the good angel says, “May it be so on the next Sabbath as well,” and the bad angel answers “Amen” against his will, etc.</i> When the Israelites are free from all sins and transgressions [as after the moment of confession of sins over the goat sent to Azazel], he indeed carries their sins away, as is mentioned in many verses in the Torah<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">106</sup><i class=\"footnote\">E.g., <i>thou shalt set the blessing upon Mount Gerizim, and the curse upon Mount Ebal</i> (Deuteronomy 11:29).</i> and the prophets.

There was also a thread of crimson wool tied to the door of the Sanctuary (<i>ibid.</i>, 68 b). At the moment of the fulfillment of the Divine command concerning this goat, the threads miraculously turned white as a sign of the Divine forgiveness, as it is said, <i>though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow</i> (Isaiah 1:18) (Yoma 68 b).</i> turned white at the time when the goat was sent away to Azazel, i.e., at the moment that he pushed it over the cliff, when it was broken in pieces, as is mentioned in the words of the Sages.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">109</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 67 a.</i>"

[It was only after he had done these things that] he immersed himself [in a ritual pool] and washed his hands and feet and took them [the golden garments] off,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">111</sup><i class=\"footnote\">So I have found in all editions of Rashi, including the first Reggio (1475) edition. But obviously the procedure was that he first removed the garments, and then immersed himself. The washing of hands and feet according to the Sages also took place before the removal of the garments (Yoma 31 b).</i> and put on the linen garments, and then he came into the Tent of Meeting [as mentioned in our verse] to take out [from the Holy of Holies] the spoon and the censer in which he had burnt the incense in the innermost part of the Sanctuary. <i>And then he shall put off the linen garments</i> after he had taken them [the spoon and the censer] out, and attires himself in his golden clothes for the Daily burnt-offering brought in the afternoon.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">112</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 28:4.</i> All this is Rashi’s language.<br>Now this is truly a case where the verse calls aloud for elucidation. For it is not at all conceivable that [the verse] should command that Aaron come into the Tent of Meeting for no purpose whatsoever other than that of taking off his garments<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">113</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse as stated reads: <i>And Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting, and shall put off the linen garments … and shall leave them there</i>. Under no circumstances, as Ramban points out, can this be taken literally. It must then mean etc.</i> and being naked in G-d’s temple, and that he should leave the garments there to decay! Rather, we must perforce interpret the verse thus: <i>And Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting</i> to do some act of the Service which Scripture found it unnecessary to mention, that is, the removal of the spoon and the censer [which he had left in the Holy of Holies when he had burnt the incense there]. The explanation of the [order of the] verses is thus as follows. Having mentioned at first, <i>And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the Eternal, that the cloud of the incense may cover the ark-cover that is upon the testimony, that he die not</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">114</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 13.</i> meaning to say that he is to place the incense upon the fire until the cloud of the incense goes up, and then he is to go out immediately, leaving there the spoon [in which he had carried the incense] and the censer [which contained the coals of fire, and upon which the incense was now burning], and which he would in any case have to remove later on from there, Scripture therefore says, <i>and Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting</i> in order to enter within the Veil [and to bring out] the things he had left there. Now the Scriptural section here did not mention all that the priest did at the beginning when [attired] in the golden garments, such as the [offering of the] Daily burnt-offering of the morning,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">112</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 28:4.</i> but rather it began with the [special] Service performed on the Day of Atonement, which was done in the white [linen] garments, and it arranged the following procedure [of things to be done in these garments]: burning of incense within the Holy of Holies, the [rites of the] bullock [of Aaron] and of the goat [whose blood was sprinkled] within [the Holy of Holies], and the matter of the goat that was sent away to Azazel. All these rites were done in one order, and there was nothing left to be performed in these [white linen] garments except for the bringing out of the spoon and the censer [from the Holy of Holies]. Now it is always the custom of Scripture to finish a subject which it began, although there may be some matters which took place after that which it mentions later [as here, where the removal of the spoon and censer took place after the events of Verses 24-28, but is referred to before, in Verse 23, to finish the subject of the events done in the white garments]. Therefore Scripture states, <i>and Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting</i> in these [white linen] garments, to complete his Service, namely, the bringing out of the spoon and the censer which he has to remove from there, and after he came out from there <i>he shall put off</i> his garments <i>which he put on</i> in the morning at the time <i>when he went into the holy place, and he shall leave them there</i> where he took them off, thus teaching us that he is not to use them again on a subsequent Day of Atonement. Therefore Scripture completed in one sequence everything that was to be done during the whole day in the white garments. [Thus Scripture mentions the removal of the spoon and censer here in Verse 23, although it actually took place only later after the events mentioned in Verses 24-28, in order to complete in one sequence all the events done in the white garments]. Then it went back and said, <i>and he shall bathe his flesh in water … and put on his other vestments</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">115</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 24.</i> i.e., those garments which are known to him from his ministry during the whole year, thus teaching that [whenever he changes on that day] from one set of garments to another, he had to immerse himself [in a ritual pool]. Then Scripture states, <i>and ‘he shall come forth,’ and offer his burnt-offering</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">115</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 24.</i> for everything that had been done hitherto in the white garments is considered “the Service within [the Sanctuary],” while his ram<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">116</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 3.</i> and the ram of the people<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">117</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 5.</i> [which are the burnt-offerings] that He mentions [here in Verse 24: <i>and he shall come forth, and offer his burnt-offering of the people</i>], were done on the outer altar. Thus the section mentioned the High Priest’s first attirement in the white garments, and required him to immerse himself [first in a ritual pool],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">118</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 4: <i>and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and put them on</i>.</i> and then it mentioned the final removal of these garments [after taking out the spoon and censer from the Holy of Holies], and required him to immerse himself [before he puts on the golden garments for the performance of the Daily burnt-offering of the afternoon]. Thus we learn that he had to immerse himself [in a ritual pool] whenever there was a change of the garments.<br>Now in the opinion of Rashi this immersion of the High Priest for the bringing out of the spoon and the censer, took place after he had offered his ram and the ram of the people; [that is to say], between the Additional Offerings<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">119</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These are specified in Numbers 29:8, among the Additional Offerings for all the festivals.</i> and the Daily burnt-offering of the afternoon.

Rashi’s statement here on the verse before us that “this is not its proper place” is thus to be understood as follows: Since Scripture wanted to complete in one section everything that was to be done in the white garments during the whole day, as is its custom everywhere to finish a subject that it began, although there may be some minor matters which are mentioned afterwards but really took place before the conclusion of that subject, it therefore purposely stated it here, although the actual performance thereof took place at a later point in the Service of the Day of Atonement, as is explained in the text.</i> The reason for this [delaying of the removal of the spoon and censer until after the slaughtering of the Daily burnt-offering of the afternoon] is because it [the removal of the spoon and censer] is not in itself a rite of Service, therefore they delayed it until all the acts of the day were done, as long as the five [required] immersions<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">130</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Such was the law taught to Moses on Sinai, that “on this day [i.e., the Day of Atonement] the High Priest immerses himself <i>five</i> times and washes his hands and feet <i>ten</i> times” as he changes from one set of garments to another in the performance of the various rites of the day (Yoma 32 a, Rashi).

This is the reason why He mentions here [in Verse 3], <i>What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that slaughtereth … within the camp or that slaughtereth out of the camp</i>. Thus He mentions also those who slaughter <i>out of the camp</i>, so that they [too] should be obliged to bring them to the door of the Tent of Meeting; for although an ordinary meal of meat will be permissible when G-d will enlarge their borders, because they are not near the place of the Sanctuary, He does not likewise permit it in the desert, even outside the camp, because they are not far from the altar of G-d as they will be in the Land when G-d will enlarge their borders, at which time He permitted them an ordinary meal of meat.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">145</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “meat eaten out of desire to satisfy the appetite.”</i><br>This is the proper interpretation of these verses, and it corresponds to the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">144</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chullin 16 b.

From this section here originates [what Rabbi Yishmael] said, that “at first [i.e., as long as Israel was in the desert] they were forbidden to have an ordinary meal of meat.” This is the fitting interpretation of the verse by way of the plain meaning of Scripture. It [also] coincides with the saying of the Rabbis in the Agadah:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">157</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Devarim Rabbah 4:6.</i> “The Rabbis say: There are many things which the Holy One, blessed be He, prohibited, and in another place permitted them again.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">158</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The meaning of course is obvious, that under a different set of circumstances He permitted those matters which He had prohibited elsewhere. The case before us is the perfect example, as the text continues.</i> You may know this [from the following instance]. The Holy One, blessed be He, forbade Israel to slaughter and eat an animal unless they brought it to the door of the Sanctuary [and slaughtered it as a peace-offering]. Whence do I know this? Because it is written, <i>and he hath not brought it into the door of the Tent of Meeting</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">159</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 4.</i> What is written there? <i>Blood shall be imputed unto that man</i> etc.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">159</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 4.</i> And here [in the Book of Deuteronomy] He again permitted it to them, as it is said, <i>thou mayest eat flesh, after all the desire of thy soul</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">156</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 20.</i> Whence do I know [that this applies to the time after their entry into the Land]? From that which is stated there on this subject, <i>When the Eternal thy G-d shall enlarge thy border</i>.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">156</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 20.</i> As for that which Rashi has commented [here in Verse 3 on the expression, <i>what man soever there be that slaughtereth an ox, or lamb</i> etc.] that “Scripture is speaking of consecrated animals etc.” [while we have explained above that Verses 3-6 refer to ordinary animals, the answer is that Rashi here follows] the opinion of that Sage<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">160</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Akiba (Chullin 17 a).</i> who says that an ordinary meal of meat<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">145</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “meat eaten out of desire to satisfy the appetite.”</i> was never prohibited at all [even when Israel was in the desert].

But it is likely that they are called <i>se’irim</i> [a word which also means ‘goats’], because mentally deranged persons see them in the form of goats. And the word ‘more’ [in the verse before us, <i>and they shall no ‘more’ sacrifice</i> …] indicates that the Israelites used to do so in Egypt. <i>After whom they go astray</i> denotes that whoever seeks after them and believes in them ‘goes astray’ from his G-d, since he thinks that there is a power that can cause good or evil apart from the Glorious and Fearful Name.” [Thus far the words of Ibn Ezra.]<br>Now Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra has indeed hinted at the truth concerning the word “more,” as I have written above.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">169</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 16:8 [beginning with the paragraph: “And this is the secret of the matter. They used to worship etc.”].</i> The name <i>se’irim</i> will also be made clear to you there. They are also called <i>sheidim</i> [“demons,” as Rashi interpreted here — a word which is connected with <i>shodad</i>, meaning “devastate, despoil, ruin”], because they dwell in “devastated” places, such as the desert, and their principal habitat is in the far corners [of the earth], such as the northern extremity of the earth which is wasteland on account of the cold climate.<br>Know that just as the formation at the original Creation of man’s body as well as that of all living creatures, vegetation and minerals, was from the four elements,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">170</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Fire, water, earth, and air.

The body [of these creatures of two elements] is of a spiritual nature; on account of its delicacy and lightness it can fly through fire and air. And just as the combination of the four elements in any object is the cause of its existence and its destruction [since everything that is composite must ultimately revert to its original components],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">172</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ramban on Genesis 2:17, Vol. I, p. 75.</i> so is it with these beings created from a combination of only two elements; when the elements combine, the creature lives, and when they separate [decompose], it is like the dead. It is for this reason that our Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">173</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chagigah 16 a.</i> “Six characteristics have been said of <i>sheidim</i>, in three they are comparable to the ministering angels and in three to human beings. The three things in which they are comparable to the ministering angels are that they have wings, they fly, and they know what is about to happen, as do the ministering angels. [On this statement the Gemara asked:] ‘How can it enter your mind to say that the <i>sheidim</i> know the future [when even the ministering angels do not know it]! Say rather thus: They hear [from behind <i>the Curtain of heaven</i>] what is about to happen.’ The three things in which they are comparable to human beings are that they eat and drink, procreate, and die as do human beings.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">174</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban now begins to explain the text quoted on the basis of certain scientific concepts that were prevalent in his times. A prefatory word is in place. The serious student will not look upon these concepts with an eye for criticism. The theory that the whole physical world is founded upon various combinations of four elements, was an Aristotelian legacy which ruled man’s minds for a millenium. The extension of that theory into the elusive world of the spirit was logical. That scientists today have moved to other theories to explain the universe and the various phenomena of life, has no bearing upon the explanations which were accepted in the past, for who can foretell what knowledge will do to “the established truths” of today? The important thing in Ramban’s presentation of this whole obstruse subject is his final conclusion that only G-d in His Providence exercises power over man’s destiny.</i> Now the cause of death generally is the separation [decomposition] of the components of the body, this being true of all kinds of bodies [whether they are composed of the four elements like humans or of only two, like <i>sheidim</i>]. The reason for their ability to fly is because of the lightness of the [two] elements [fire and air] of which they are composed, as may also be seen in the case of a fowl, in which, because the elements of fire and air dominate over the small parts of the other two elements [earth and water], the fowl can hover in the air and fly [although it is composed of all four elements]. Surely, then, the above-mentioned creatures that have nothing in them of the heavy elements [earth and water], possess great hovering power in the air, to be able to fly tirelessly. The matter of “eating” [mentioned above in connection with these creatures] means their deriving nourishment from the moisture of water and the odors of fire, something like the fire that <i>licked up the water that was in the trench</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">175</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Kings 18:38.</i> This is the purpose of the burnings which necromancers perform to the demons. The reason [for their need to “eat”] is that the fire in the air causes the drying up of their bodies, which must therefore be restored just as man’s need for food is due to depletion in his body. As for that which has been said concerning their “hearing what is about to happen,” it is because in the course of their flying on high they become aware of things that are about to happen from the powerful forces contained in the atmosphere, these being “the princes of the quiver.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">176</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A reference to the forces involved in the movement of the constellations. See my Hebrew commentary p. 96.</i> It is also from there that “those who have wings tell matters”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">177</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The expression is based on Ecclesiastes 10:20: <i>For a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter</i>.</i> of the future, as has been tested by enchanters,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">178</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Maimonides’ “The Commandments,” Vol. II, pp. 30-35.</i> and as I will explain in its place<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">179</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 18:9.</i> with the help of G-d.

Therefore Onkelos rendered the verse, <i>They sacrificed unto demons, ‘lo eloha’</i> (<i>no gods</i>),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">181</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 32:17.</i> as “they sacrificed unto demons in which there is no utility,” meaning that there is no need for them, as they do not prevent harm that is destined to come, neither do they do anything productive, nor do they inform of times far off so that a person may knowingly guard himself. It is this which is the sense of the expression, <i>lo eloha</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">181</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 32:17.</i> which is as if it said, “no power or rulership,” for the word <i>Elokim</i> is an expression of strength and power, [a composite word consisting of the words] <i>e-il heim</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">182</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ramban, Genesis 1:3 (Vol. I, p. 25) where he explains the name to mean: <i>e-il</i> (Force), <i>heim</i> (they), the word “they” alluding to all other forces.

                    "FOR THE LIFE OF THE FLESH IS IN THE BLOOD; AND I HAVE GIVEN IT TO YOU UPON THE ALTAR TO MAKE ATONEMENT FOR YOUR SOULS. The sense of this verse is to state that He forbade us [to eat] blood because He has given it to us to be upon the altar and to effect atonement for our souls, and it is therefore the part dedicated to G-d, just as is the case with the forbidden fat.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">184</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 3:17.</i> And if one should ask: “Why then has He forbidden us to eat the blood of a wild animal and that of a fowl, from which offerings are not brought?” We will dismiss the questioner by saying that it was His wish to keep us far away from eating any kind of blood, in order that we should never make a mistake therein [and eat forbidden blood as a result of failing to distinguish between one kind of blood and another]. In the case of fat, however, He did not [categorically] forbid all kinds of fat, because [the permissible kind of fat] is distinguishable from the non-permissible.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">185</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ramban above, 3:9, that even in the same animal the prohibited fat is distinguishable from the permitted fat. So also are the fats of a permitted fowl and wild beast [which are permitted to be eaten] distinguishable from those fats of a permitted animal that may not be eaten. This is not so in the case of blood; hence He prohibited all blood, even that of fowls and wild animals which are not offered upon the altar.</i><br>Now the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] wrote in the Moreh Nebuchim<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">186</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Guide of the Perplexed, III, 46.</i> that the Chaldeans loathed blood, considering it impure, and only those who sought to establish contact with the demons and to foretell the future would eat it. Now the Torah always seeks to destroy these foolish theories, by [ordaining measures which are] contrary to their ideas. Therefore He prohibited the eating of blood and chose it as the means of purifying [the impure] by means of the sprinklings thereof,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">187</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Such as in the case of the leper (above, 14:14).</i> and to throw it upon the altar of G-d for atonement. Therefore He said, <i>I will set My face against that soul that eateth blood</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">188</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 10.</i> just as He said with reference to him who gives of his children to Molech,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">189</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 20:6: <i>And I will set My face against that soul</i>.</i> because this [practice of eating blood] leads to a kind of idol worship, such words not being stated concerning any other commandment. Now these words [of Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon] are sensible in themselves, however the verses do not indicate [that the reason for the prohibition against eating blood is] so [as the Rabbi has said], for they always state the reason for that prohibition to be, <i>For as to the life of all flesh, the blood thereof is all one with the life thereof;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">190</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 14.</i> <i>For the life of the flesh is in the blood</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">191</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Verse 11 before us.</i> And in the Book of Deuteronomy He again states, <i>Only be steadfast in not eating the blood; for the blood is the life; and thou shalt not eat the life with the flesh</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">192</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 12:23.</i><br>It is proper, therefore, to explain the reason for the prohibition against eating blood by saying that G-d created all lower creatures for the purpose of man, since only he amongst all of them recognizes his Creator. Nonetheless, He did not at first permit man to eat anything except for vegetation, but no living creatures at all, just as is stated in the Chapter of Creation where it is said, <i>Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed</i> etc. <i>for food</i>;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">193</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 1:29. See Ramban there (Vol. I, pp. 57-58) for a full exposition of the thought presented here briefly.</i> but when the flood came and they [the lower creatures] were saved by the merit of Noah, and he brought offerings from them to G-d which were acceptable before Him,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">194</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 8:21.</i> He gave man permission to slaughter [and eat them], just as He said, <i>Every moving thing that liveth shall be for food for you; as the green herb have I given you all</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">195</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 9:3.</i> since their existence was because of man. Thus He permitted man to use their bodies for his benefit and needs because their life was on account of man’s sake, and that their soul [i.e., blood] should be used for man’s atonement when offering them up before Him, blessed be He, but not to eat it, since one creature possessed of a soul is not to eat another creature with a soul, for all souls belong to G-d. The life of man just as the life of the animal are all His, <i>even one thing befalleth them; as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">196</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ecclesiastes 3:19.</i><br>Now in the opinion of the Greek philosopher [i.e., Aristotle] as interpreted by those who scrutinize his words, it was out of the Active Intellect<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">197</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A concept of great significance in Medieval philosophy, the Active Intellect denoted an incorporeal substance, the role of which was to make the forms of the imagination “actual” objects of the intellect, after they have been only “potential” objects of the intellect. Yehudah Halevi in his “Al Khazari,” when presenting the view of the philosophers, writes of it: “This is the degree of the Active Intellect, namely, that angel whose degree is below the angel who is connected with the sphere of the moon” (p. 37). It is out of that Active Intellect that the animal soul originated.</i> that there emitted a very fine and bright flash and glitter of light, from which came forth the spark which is the soul of the animal. It is thus in a certain sense a real soul. It therefore has sufficient understanding to avoid harm, and to seek its welfare, and a sense of recognition towards those with whom it is familiar, and love towards them, just as dogs love their masters, and they have a wonderful sense of recognition of the people of their households, and similarly pigeons have a sense of knowledge and recognition. Now it is also known that the food one eats is taken into the body of the eater <i>and they become one flesh</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">198</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 2:24.</i> If one were to eat <i>the life of all flesh</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">190</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 14.</i> it would then attach itself to one’s own blood and they would become united in one’s heart, and the result would be a thickening and coarsensss of the human soul so that it would closely approach the nature of the animal soul which resided in that which he ate, since blood does not require digestion as other foods do, which thereby become changed, and thus man’s soul will become combined with the blood of the animal! And Scripture states, <i>Who knoweth the spirit of man whether it goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast whether it goeth downward to the earth?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">199</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ecclesiastes 3:21.</i> It is for this reason that He said, <i>For as to the life of all flesh, the blood thereof is all one with the flesh thereof</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">190</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 14.</i> for all flesh, whether man or beast, has its soul in the blood, and it is not fitting to mix the soul that is destined to destruction with that which is to live [in the hereafter]. Rather, it is to be as an atonement upon the altar to be acceptable before G-d. This is the sense of the expression, <i>Therefore I said to the children of Israel: No soul of you shall eat blood</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">200</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 12.</i> meaning: “Because the blood is identical with the soul, and it is not proper that one soul devour another, therefore I had compassion upon man’s life and gave it [the animal’s soul] to him upon the altar, so that the soul of the animal should effect atonement for his soul.” Thus we have been taught in the Sifre:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">201</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifre, <i>R’eih</i> 76.</i> “<i>Only be steadfast in not eating the blood</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">192</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 12:23.</i> Rabbi Yehudah says, [From the fact that it states, <i>only be steadfast</i>, which indicates that a special effort was required], you learn that they were addicted to eating blood etc. <i>For the blood is the life</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">192</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 12:23.</i> — this teaches you why it was prohibited. <i>And thou shalt not eat the life with the flesh</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">192</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 12:23.</i> — this prohibits the eating of a limb cut from a living animal.” This is a hint and proof for what we have explained. It is for this reason that He further commanded that we are to cover up all blood of an [edible] wild beast or fowl [which have been ritually slaughtered]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">202</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 13.</i> because their blood is not brought upon the altar, for even of fowls only two species [i.e., young pigeons and turtle doves] may be brought as offerings, and they too are not slaughtered [in the usual way];<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">203</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See above, 1:15.</i> but in the case of cattle, most of them that are found among men may be slaughtered to the Glorious Name and their blood is used for atonement, and it is therefore not to be covered.

Hence Ramban will present other interpretations of the verse.</i> Rather, it is possible to explain that the word <i>b’nafsho</i> here means “in its body,” Scripture thus stating, “<i>for as to the life of all flesh</i>, it is the blood in its body.” Similarly [we find the word <i>nefesh</i> meaning “body” in these verses]: <i>‘Nafsho’</i> (<i>his person</i>) <i>was laid in iron;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">206</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 105:18.</i> <i>seventy ‘nefesh’</i> (<i>persons</i>);<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">207</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 1:5.</i> <i>he</i> [the Nazirite] <i>shall not come near to a dead ‘nefesh,’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">208</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 6:6.</i> meaning “a body,” since “the body” of anyone that is possessed of a <i>nefesh</i> (soul) is also called <i>nefesh</i>.<br>In my opinion Scripture mentioned three expressions with reference to blood, which constitute but one reason. First it stated, <i>For the life of the flesh is in the blood</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">209</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 11.</i> Then it changed and said [in Verse 14 before us], <i>For as to the life of all flesh, the blood thereof is all one with the life thereof</i>, meaning to say that the blood is the life, and the life is in the blood, as both are mixed together, similarly to wine when diluted with water, in which case the water is in the wine and the wine in the water, and each one is “in” the other. Afterwards it explained [in the second half of Verse 14 before us, stating <i>for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof</i>], that the blood is the very life, meaning to say that both have become one inseparable substance, so that you can never find blood without life nor life without blood, as is known of the air<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">210</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The sense here is clearly “the force of the heart beat” pumping the blood.

The reason for the prohibition of sexual relationships with one’s near of kin is not expressly written [in the Torah]. The Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] wrote in the Moreh Nebuchim<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">253</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Guide of the Perplexed III, 49.</i> that [this law seeks to inculcate the lessons that] we should limit sexual intercourse, hold it in contempt, and perform it rarely. Now these women which Scripture has forbidden amongst the relatives of one’s wife are forbidden because they are constantly together with him in his house,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">254</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“For as a rule, the mother of the wife, her grandmother, daughter, granddaughter, and sister-in-law are often with her; the husband meets them always when he goes out, when he comes in, and when he is at his work” (<i>ibid.</i>, Friedlander’s translation). Now “if we were allowed to marry any of them, and were only precluded from sexual intercourse with them without marriage, most people would constantly become guilty of misconduct with them. But as they are entirely forbidden to us … there is reason to expect that people will not seek it, and will not think of it” (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> and the same applies to one’s own relatives [sisters, aunts, and the wife of one’s uncle], who are frequently with him and he is closeted together with them. A similar reason the Rabbi states for all forbidden relations. Now Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra has already written<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">255</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the verse before us.</i> likewise that since the passion of man’s heart is like that of the animals, it was impossible for Scripture to forbid all females, and therefore it prohibited only those that are available to him at all times. But this is a very weak reason, that Scripture should make a person liable to the punishment of excision in the case of these forbidden relations, just because they are sometimes found together with him, and at the same time permit a man to marry many women, even in the hundreds and thousands! And what harm would there be if a man would marry only his daughter, just as was permitted to the Noachides,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">256</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 58 b.</i> or marry two sisters as did our patriarch Jacob?

Similarly, where [the union is such that] the child born therefrom will not have a healthy existence, nor succeed from it, the Torah prohibited such a union. This is the sense of the expressions: <i>el kol ‘sh’eir’ b’saro</i> [literally: <i>to any ‘flesh’ next to his flesh</i>]; <i>for he hath made naked ‘eth sh’eiro’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">259</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 29:19. See Ramban on Exodus 21:9 (Vol. II, pp. 356-7), where he elaborates on the meaning of this word <i>sh’eir</i>.</i> [literally: <i>his flesh</i>]. Thus the Torah forbade these marriages on account of <i>sh’eir</i> [i.e., because the forbidden relations constitute “flesh” next to one’s own], the term <i>sh’eir</i> being derived from the expression [in the verse], <i>‘hanish’ar’</i> (<i>he that is left</i>) <i>in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">260</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 4:3. The term <i>sh’eir</i> denoting “flesh” or “relative” is something which “remains” with a person, as it is his own or next to his flesh.</i> Hence Scripture states, <i>they are ‘sha’arah’</i> (<i>near kinswomen</i>); <i>it is lewdness</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">261</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 17.</i> meaning to say, “these are not marriages, nor fit for such a relationship, for they will not succeed [in having healthy offspring, as explained above]; rather it is lewdness, mere thoughts of indecency.” Thus the forbidden relationships are included in “the statutes,” the laws which constitute “the decrees of the King.” Now a decree is an ordinance which originates in the knowledge of the King, Who is wise in the management of His kingdom, and it is He Who knows the need for and the benefit of the command that He ordained, and He does not tell it to anyone except to His wise counsellors."

See “The Commandments,” Vol. II, pp. 315-317.</i> But I wonder, according to the opinion of the Sages [who explain the verse, <i>the nakedness of thy father</i> as being a prohibition against lying carnally with one’s father], why did He not likewise admonish against lying carnally with a son or brother, in addition to prohibiting [sexual relationships with their] wives?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">266</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verses 15-16.</i> Perhaps the Torah was more particular in guarding the honor of the elders.

The correct interpretation by way of the simple meaning of Scripture appears to me to be that <i>the nakedness of thy father, and the nakedness of thy mother</i> [<i>shalt thou not uncover</i>], constitute but one negative commandment and one admonition, which forbids intercourse with one’s own mother, for in having such intercourse he thereby uncovers the nakedness of his father and that of his mother. This is the sense of the [concluding] expression in this verse, <i>she is thy mother</i>, meaning that you have done with her two evils, in that you have uncovered the nakedness of your mother and that of your father. Following the admonition against uncovering the nakedness of one’s father, which refers [as explained] to one’s mother, He went back [in the following Verse 8] and admonished against [uncovering] the nakedness of one’s father’s wife, although she be not one’s mother, saying, <i>The nakedness of thy father’s wife shalt thou not uncover; it is thy father’s nakedness</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">268</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 8.</i> Similarly, <i>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s brother</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">269</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 14.</i> means [as the verse itself continues], <i>thou shalt not approach to his wife</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">269</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 14.</i> This is why it does not say “and” to [<i>his wife thou shalt not approach</i>]."

And yet all [sisters] are forbidden by excision [i.e., regardless of whether the sister was born of a union itself permitted, or forbidden by whipping only, or by excision], unless she be born of a bondwoman or a Cuthean woman [in which case she is not considered his sister at all]!<br>And I wonder at the Rabbi [Rashi]!

For it is written, <i>If a man have two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">272</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 21:15.</i> Now is there before G-d a beloved one and a hated one [i.e., could it be supposed that the law should allow discrimination between the children of a favored wife and those of a hated wife]?

Thus you must say that in the case of a marriage which is “hated” because it is punishable merely by whipping, [as in the case of a man marrying a <i>mamzereth</i>], the act of betrothal <i>does</i> take effect, and the daughter born from such a union is considered one’s “sister” with respect to the prohibition before us.</i> Perhaps I might say that this excludes a sister born of a union punishable by excision [so that she is not his ‘sister’ in the sense that she is included in the prohibition against having intercourse with one’s sister]! Said Rava: Scripture states, <i>The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or the daughter of thy mother, whether born at home, or born abroad</i>, which means whether [the court] can say to your father, ‘Keep [the mother as your wife],’ or whether it has to say to him, <i>‘Hotzei’</i> [as explained further on], and yet the Merciful One states that she is <i>thy sister</i>!”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">274</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since Verse 9 before us begins, <i>The nakedness of ‘thy sister,’</i> and yet goes on to mention the one <i>‘born abroad,’</i> it is clear that even a daughter born of a union which is punishable by excision [as explained further on], is a “sister” with respect to this prohibition.</i> Now the meaning of the word <i>hotzei</i> is that [the court] tells him, “Take her out from your house, for she is not your [legitimate] wife, and the act of marriage has no legal validity in those cases where the union is punishable by excision or by any of the [four] deaths by the hand of the court.” And yet notwithstanding this, one is punished for having intercourse with her because she <i>is</i> considered his sister!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">275</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is thus clear that even if the mother were one of those forbidden relations to his father with whom sexual intercourse is punishable by excision, the daughter born is still forbidden as a “sister.” This does not appear to be so from the language of Rashi before us, who singled out cases of marriages forbidden only by whipping, in which cases the betrothal is valid! See above, Note 270.</i> Only one’s sister born from a bondwoman or a Cuthean woman is not included in this prohibition, since the offspring is of her own [legal] standing.<br>By way of the plain meaning of Scripture the verse is stating: “<i>The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or the daughter of thy mother, whether born</i> of a marriage, as when the father brought the woman into the home as a wife [and she gave birth to a daughter], <i>or born abroad</i>, as when the man found her outside, <i>and lay hold on her, and lie with her</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">276</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 22:28.</i> and she gave him birth [to a daughter], <i>thou shalt not uncover their nakedness</i>.” Thus He mentioned [the prohibition concerning] a mother’s daughter whether she be born in wedlock or from unchastity. For even though in either case she is only his mother’s daughter and not his father’s daughter, [and if so, why did Scripture have to mention both cases], yet one might have thought that a brotherly relationship [forbidding sexual intercourse] applies only to a sister born in wedlock, but not to one born from unchastity, where everything is “free;” therefore Scripture had to admonish against all [kinds of sisters]. There is yet another verse which He stated with reference to one’s father’s daughter, stating <i>The nakedness of thy father’s wife’s daughter, begotten of thy father</i> [<i>thou shalt not uncover</i>],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">277</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 11.</i> this being [a prohibition against having intercourse with] a sister who is one’s father’s daughter born of his legitimate wife. It was necessary that He state this, because having said [in Verse 9 before us], <i>the nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father</i>, without any qualification, and then in connection with <i>the daughter of thy mother</i> He explained <i>whether born at home</i> through marriage, <i>or born abroad</i> through unchastity, one might therefore have thought that one’s father’s daughter born in unchastity is permissible to him; for perhaps the Torah was not particular about a man’s offspring born in unchastity, because these are not known to him; therefore He said in explanation, <i>The nakedness of thy father’s wife’s daughter</i> [<i>thou shalt not uncover</i>], thus declaring that the daughter of one’s father mentioned at first [in Verse 9 before us] is not one’s father’s daughter born of his legitimate wife [since that is specifically mentioned further on in Verse 11]. Also, because in the case of the Noachides the prohibition [against sexual intercourse] was only if the brotherhood was from the same mother, and not [if it was exclusively] from the father, Scripture therefore explains that with respect to Israelites, all are alike in the prohibition [whether they are born of one father or one mother].<br>The correct interpretation of this verse is what the Sages have said in the Gemara of Tractate Yebamoth;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">278</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yebamoth 22a.</i> “A man who has intercourse with his sister, who is also the daughter of his father’s wife [through marriage]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">279</sup><i class=\"footnote\">So explained <i>ibid.</i>, in Rashi.</i> who is not his mother,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">280</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This phrase is not found in our Gemara, but it is a correct explanation.</i> is guilty both on account of his sister, and his father’s wife’s daughter.” And there in the Gemara the Rabbis explained the reason: “Observe, it is written, <i>the nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father</i> etc.; what need was there for the expression, <i>the nakedness of thy father’s wife’s daughter</i> etc.?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">277</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 11.</i> In order to teach that he is guilty both on account of his sister, and his father’s wife’s daughter.” Thus Scripture repeats certain prohibitions in order to make one [who commits these abominable practices] guilty on many counts, for even with reference to creeping things [which we are forbidden to eat] He has repeated many prohibitions regarding one matter, in order to punish the offender on all counts."

Onkelos translated: “it is a sinful plan,” and Rashi commented thereon, “because your evil inclination counsels you to sin.” But I know of no sense to this, for with regard to all forbidden relations and all other transgressions, it is the evil inclination that counsels one to sin! [Why then is this verse prohibiting intercourse with a woman and her daughter, singled out by the use of this expression?] But the meaning of the matter is that the term <i>zimah</i> is derived from the expression, <i>as ‘zamam’</i> (<i>he had purposed</i>) <i>to do unto his brother</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">281</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 19:19.</i> A proper thought is called <i>m’zimah</i>, as it said, <i>And no ‘m’zimah’</i> (<i>purpose</i>) <i>can be withholden from Thee</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">282</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 42:2.</i> and lewdness that is thought of in secret is called <i>zimah</i>, similar to that which it is said, <i>If my heart have been enticed unto a woman</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">283</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 31:9.</i> and Scripture concludes, <i>For that were ‘zimah’</i> (<i>a heinous crime</i>); <i>yea, it were an iniquity to be punished by the judges</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">284</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 11.</i> Similarly, <i>‘v’zimatheich’</i> (<i>thy lewdness</i>) <i>and thy harlotries;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">285</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 23:29.</i> <i>‘v’zimath’</i> (<i>the lewdness of</i>) <i>thy harlotry</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">286</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 13:27.</i> denoting these illicit acts committed in private and in public.

And the explanation of the verses here is as follows: At the beginning of the section He said, <i>None of you shall approach to any that is ‘sh’eir’</i> (<i>near of</i>) <i>flesh to him, to uncover their nakedness</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">291</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 6.</i> thus prohibiting [sexual intercourse with] those who are near of flesh to him, and He stated the reason for this to be, <i>for theirs is thine own nakedness</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">292</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 10.</i> and so now [in Verse 17 before us] where He prohibits the wife’s relations, He states <i>‘sha’arah heinah’</i> (<i>they are near kinswomen</i>), meaning to say that they are also forbidden because they [the women] are near of flesh to each other, and lying with both of them would be lewdness, as I have explained.

It would also appear from Ramban’s quote of Ibn Ezra further on in Verse 20, that the purpose of sexual intercourse is threefold, and the raising of children is only one purpose. Hence Ramban’s statement here must be understood in the sense that the “principal” purpose thereof is the raising of children.</i> and since the whole child or the greater part thereof is created out of the woman’s blood, as I have already mentioned,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">299</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, at beginning of <i>Seder Tazria</i>.</i> and from the blood of menstruation it is not created at all [therefore the Torah prohibited intercourse with her during the period of her impurity]. Indeed, how could a child be formed out of this blood, since it is deadly poisonous, capable of causing the death of any creature that drinks or eats it! Now when the womb contains a large amount of this blood of menstruation, the woman cannot become pregnant, as this blood is not endowed at all with the capacity for forming [a child]. Even if she were to become pregnant from other blood, and then derive nourishment from this blood, the child would die. Physicians have also mentioned already that if the foetus derives nourishment from the best of blood, and all its nutriment be of the best quality, but some of this blood of menstruation is mixed with it, it will cause it to go bad, and produce in the child inflammatory swellings and sores of all kinds. And in the opinion of our Rabbis,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">300</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tanchuma, <i>Metzora</i> 1.</i> even if a small part of this [blood of menstruation] remains, in the foetus, the child will be a leper. By virtue, then, of all these reasons it was fitting that the Torah prohibit intercourse with a menstruant. The doctors have also told us in connection with it, a true experience, which is one of <i>the wondrous works of Him Who is perfect in knowledge</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">301</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 37:16.</i> in creation, that if a menstruant woman at the beginning of her issue were to concentrate her gaze for some time upon a polished iron mirror, there would appear in the mirror red spots resembling drops of blood, for the bad part therein [i.e., in the issue] that is by its nature harmful, causes a certain odium, and the unhealthy condition of the air attaches to the mirror, just as a viper kills with its gaze. And surely it is harmful to have intercourse with her then, since physically and mentally she is attached to the man’s body and mind. Therefore Scripture prohibited it by saying, <i>and her impurity will be upon him</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">302</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 15:24.</i> meaning that her condition is a contagious one. It is with reference to this that it states, <i>the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">303</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 36:17.</i> always mentioning in connection with her the term “impurity,” which is like that used in speaking of a creeping thing and of a leper, in which cases their impurity is within their bodies. It is possible that this is the sense of the expression, <i>he hath bared her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">304</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 20:18.</i> for that blemished fountain should be covered, and not bared in order to draw its bad and extremely harmful waters. Thus intercourse has been prohibited to <i>the holy seed</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">305</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 6:13.</i> all the days of her impurity, until she immerses herself in water [i.e., in a ritual pool],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">306</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For no amount of washing the body can take the place of ritual immersion, where such is prescribed.</i> for then she will be purified also in her thoughts,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">307</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is obviously a reference to what Rambam wrote in his Mishneh Torah at the end of <i>Hilchoth Mikvaoth</i>, on the significance of immersion, that it is not merely a matter of removing mud or dirt which may be removed by water, but “it is a Scriptural decree, the validity of the act depending upon the disposition of the heart. It is for this reason that the Sages have said. ‘If he immersed himself without intention, it is as though he had not immersed himself at all’ (Chagigah 18 b) … Thus he whose heart intends to purify himself, becomes purified as soon as the [actual] immersion is accomplished.” It is clear, then, that since both body and soul must participate in the act of immersion, the effect and potency of the purification applies to both body and soul as Ramban here states, “for then she will be purified also in her thoughts, and become completely clean.” See “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 117-119.</i> and become completely clean [in body and mind]."

To this question Ramban answers that it was also known to them by the name “Milcom” [in the time of Solomon]. Hence Scripture used that name.</i><br>Now Rashi commented: “And this was the manner in which the Molech was worshipped: he [the father] would hand over his son to the priests, and the priests lit two large pyres [one opposite the other], and they made the child pass on foot between the two fires. <i>Thou shalt not give</i>, this refers to [the father] handing over [the child] to the priests. <i>‘L’ha’avir lamolech’</i> is the passing through the open fire.” But this is not correct.

Ramban will later on explain that at the Molech the child was passed through the flames so many times that the flames actually burnt him.</i> meaning that he made him pass through the actual fire [by leaping through it]. Scripture mentions [both conditions to make the father liable to punishment]: a “giving” as it is said, <i>and thou shalt not ‘give’ any of thy seed</i> …], and the act of making him “pass through the fire” [as it is said in Deuteronomy 18:10: <i>There shall not be found among you anyone that ‘maketh his son or his daughter pass through the fire’</i>], so that the father does not incur punishment unless he delivers his child to the priests [of Molech] and he [i.e., the father] made him pass through the fire, as is explained in Tractate Sanhedrin.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">325</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 64 b.</i> Similarly, that which the Rabbi [Rashi] wrote that the father hands him over to the priests and they make him pass through the fire — and so he wrote also in his commentaries to Tractate Sanhedrin<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">327</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 64 a.</i> — that does not appear to be so from the language of the Rabbis here in the Gemara.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">328</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Gemara speaks there of a case where “he made all his offspring pass through the fire” — an expression which indicates that it is the father himself who makes them pass through the fire.</i> Moreover, how could the father be liable to death for the worship of Molech done by others [i.e., the priests]?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">329</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, if, as Rashi said, it is the priests who perform the rite of passing the child through the fire, it is they who do the forbidden act of worship and not the father.

And so did Rashi explain [that there was no actual burning of the child].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">325</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 64 b.</i><br>Yet notwithstanding all this, it appears to me on the basis of decisive verses that the child <i>was</i> actually consumed by the flames, for Scripture states, <i>and their sons, whom they bore unto Me, they have also made them pass through unto them ‘to be devoured,’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">334</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 23:37.</i> and further on there it says, <i>and when they had slain their children to their idols</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">335</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 39.</i> meaning that they passed him through the fire until he was burnt or died in the fire, this being “the slaying” [mentioned in the verse], for the expression <i>they have made them pass through unto them</i> is a reference to the worship of Molech, and Scripture states <i>to be devoured</i> and also mentions the term slaying! If so, when the Rabbis said [with reference to the Molech that it was] “like a leaping place of Purim,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">326</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Like children leaping over a bonfire” (Rashi <i>ibid.</i>). The Talmudic text <i>k’mishvarto d’puria</i> is thus explained by Rashi “as a leaping place of Purim,” i.e., like a bonfire made on Purim for merriment, over which children leap. Ramban will later on explain that at the Molech the child was passed through the flames so many times that the flames actually burnt him.</i> they meant to say that they made the child pass through the flame many times, until he died in the burning fire. Thus by law of the Torah the father is liable to punishment from the moment of the child’s first passing through, as soon as the fire takes hold of him, such as where one of his limbs took fire. It is for this reason that the Rabbis had to say that he who passes himself through the fire is not liable, [since the liability to punishment begins at the moment when the fire takes hold of one of his limbs, when he is still alive]. But the fire actually consumed the victim, as this was their sacrifice to Molech. And the expression of <i>ma’avir ba’eish</i> [which until now we have understood as “passing through the fire”] always denotes “something burnt by fire, but not [totally] consumed thereby,” for they used to put [the victim] in the fire, and then remove the body from there, and not let it turn into ashes like burnt [sacrifices], similar to utensils of gentiles [which, in order to be purified from the forbidden food they have absorbed], are made white-hot in the flame, and it is said of them, <i>ye shall make to go through the fire, and it shall be clean</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">336</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 31:23.</i> And it is said of the Ammonites, <i>and he made them pass through the brick-kiln</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">337</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Samuel 12:31.</i> meaning that he burnt them just as they do to bricks in a baking furnace. If so, <i>‘ma’avir’ his son or his daughter through the fire</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">330</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 18:10.</i> means placing him in the fire so that it should take hold of him, not merely passing him through it. And this is the meaning of <i>ha’avarah</i> which is mentioned in connection with the Molech, which was by fire according to the opinion of our Rabbis,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">325</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 64 b.</i> who derived it by means of a similarity of the term <i>ha’avarah</i> [“passing through,” mentioned here in the verse before us, and in Deuteronomy 18:10]: “just as there the ‘passing through’ is in fire [as it is said, <i>There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter ‘pass through the fire’</i>], so here too the meaning is through the fire [although it is not clearly stated], and just as here it is to the Molech, so there too it is to Molech.” Proof to the words of the Rabbis [that the meaning of this ‘passing through’ mentioned here was by fire], is that which is written of King Josiah, <i>And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">338</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Kings 23:10.</i> Thus the term <i>ha’avarah</i> (‘passing through’) mentioned here in connection with Molech means by fire. So also is it written of King Manasseh: <i>He also made his children ‘to pass through the fire’ in the valley of the son of Hinnom</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">339</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Chronicles 33:6.</i> And I have found it written of King Ahaz, <i>And he also made his son ‘to pass through the fire,’ according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the Eternal cast out from before the children of Israel</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">340</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Kings 16:3.</i> and in the Book of Chronicles it is stated [of the same king], <i>and ‘he burnt’ his children in the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen whom the Eternal cast out</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">341</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Chronicles 28:3.</i> If so, <i>ha’avarah</i> (the ‘passing through’) in fact was a burning with real fire.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">342</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban is thus suggesting that the word <i>ha’avarah</i> (“passing through”) was really an <i>hav’arah</i> (an actual burning of fire), since the verse in Kings speaking of King Ahaz uses the term <i>ha’avarah</i>, while the verse in Chronicles describing the same acts of the same king uses the term <i>hav’arah</i>. Thus it is clear that the two words are identical in meaning in this context.</i><br>Now that which Scripture states, <i>and the Sepharvites burnt their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">343</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Kings 17:31.</i> [and it does not mention Molech], that was another idol, which was worshipped by burning the victims <i>completely</i> as a sacrifice [which was burnt to ashes]. They used to worship the Baal in a similar manner, as it is written of Jeremiah, <i>Go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">344</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 19:2.</i> and there it says further, <i>and they have filled this place with the blood of innocents; and have built the high places of Baal, to burn their sons in the fire ‘for burnt-offerings’ unto Baal; which I commanded not, nor spoke it, neither came it into My mind</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">345</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 4-5.</i> And it is further written, <i>And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to make their sons and their daughters pass through unto Molech; which I commanded not, neither came it into My mind, that they should do this abomination</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">346</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 32:35.</i> However, due to the fact that these two [last mentioned] verses speak of <i>the high places of Baal</i>, both being in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and the admonition in connection with both of them is identical: <i>which I commanded not, nor spoke it, neither came it into My mind</i>, and the Molech was [also] there in that impure place, as it is written in connection with King Josiah,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">347</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>And he defiled Topheth which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter pass through the fire to Molech</i> (II Kings 23:10). The verse was mentioned above by Ramban (see text at Note 338).</i> it would appear from all this that they used to burn their children as sacrifices to Molech, which was the Baal, both names being closely associated, and meaning royalty and lordship. This is not the Baal of Peor<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">348</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 25:3.</i> or Baal-zebub,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">349</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Kings 1:2.</i> for this one [referred to by Jeremiah] was called Baal without any qualification, as Molech was so called, [without any qualification]. Scripture mentions in connection with the worship thereof the term <i>ha’avarah</i> (passing through),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">346</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 32:35.</i> because the main act of worship was by passing the children through [the two pyres] until the fire took hold of them, and it calls it “burning”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">345</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 4-5.</i> because they would die there. That is why they are called “burnt-offerings” [as it is said, <i>to burn their sons in the fire for burnt-offerings</i>].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">345</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 4-5.</i> Similarly, I am of the opinion that <i>the gods of Sepharvaim</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">343</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Kings 17:31.</i> are also identified with Molech, for their surnames [Adrammelech and Anammelech]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">343</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Kings 17:31.</i> denote kingship [as the word <i>melech</i> indicates]. Both of them were worshipped in the same way, although one was called Adra,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">350</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Sanhedrin 63 b the Talmud explains the word to mean “the mule.” The word <i>adar</i> in Aramaic means “distinction,” and the mule is so called because it gives distinction to its owner when travelling, because it carries all his belongings. The name Adrammelech thus means “The mule is the king,” or “the animal which gives distinction to the king.” See II Samuel 13:29, that the mule was ridden by princes, and I Kings 1:33 that it was ridden by the king. Ramban in explaining Adrammelech to be identical with Molech, thus suggests that the Sepharvites called their idol Adar, a name meaning “distinction,” and Adrammelech is “the king of distinction.”</i> which is an expression of respect, and the second was called Ana which is of the root <i>oneh</i> (answers),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">351</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This term according to the Talmud (Sanhedrin <i>ibid.</i>) is a reference to the horse because it “answers” its master when engaged in battle. See my Hebrew commentary p. 107, Note 44. The name Anammelech means “The horse is the king,” or “the animal which answers the king” in battle. Ramban here suggests, then, that Molech was called Anammelech because “he is the king who answers.”</i> and the name “melech” was attached to both, which is like Molech. The “burning” mentioned in connection with them<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">343</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Kings 17:31.</i> was the death of the victims by fire, as I have explained [above]. But if we were to say that these detestations [Adrammelech and Anammelech] were not the Molech, then it is possible that because they were worshipped by means of sons and daughters being brought to them in fire, in a similar manner to that which it says about the Molech, therefore their names [Adra and Ana] were combined with his name, and form a <i>melech</i> (king) or Baal, but the modes of worship were not the same. For the Molech was worshipped with “passing through” [the fire], and the gods of Sepharvaim with burning,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">343</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Kings 17:31.</i> and the Baal with slaughtering first and then burning, like burnt-offerings.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">345</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 4-5.</i> And it is further said [in Jeremiah] that in the place of the <i>Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">338</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Kings 23:10.</i> there were also high places to Baal [as mentioned in connection with King Josiah, that he defiled that place so <i>that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech</i>], and it also mentions there the Molech [and Molech and Baal were to some extent identical, as stated above]. Thus that which Scripture states, <i>And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to make their sons and their daughters to pass through unto Molech</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">346</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 32:35.</i> [which would seem to indicate that Molech and Baal are <i>entirely</i> identical, contrary to what we have said above], really means: “and” <i>to make their sons and their daughters pass through</i> [the fire] <i>unto Molech</i>.<br>Now our Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">352</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 63 b.</i> “The father of Hezekiah king of Judah too [i.e., Ahaz] wanted to do so to him [in his infancy], and to burn him in the fire, but his mother saved him from death by rubbing him with the oil of<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">353</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“With the oil of” — this phrase is not mentioned in the Gemara.

However, the righteous [Hezekiah] was saved by this salamander, which the Holy One, blessed be He, created for his sake.<br>By way of the simple meaning of Scripture they<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">355</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Evidently the reference is to certain commentators. But I have not identified these.</i> have said that the matter of “making a son or daughter pass through the fire” was one of the forms of sorcery, for it is in connection with sorcery that it is said, <i>There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter pass through the fire, one that useth divination, a soothsayer, or an enchanter, or a sorcerer</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">356</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 18:10. The fact that all these practices are mentioned together proves that the rite of “passing through the fire” was also some form of witchcraft, while the actual burning of the victim was an entirely different matter, since that was a form of idol worship to Molech. All this we would say according to the plain meaning of Scripture. But see further, Note 359.</i> And in the case of King Manasseh Scripture likewise states, <i>He also made his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom; and he practised soothsaying, and used enchantments, and practised sorcery and appointed them that divined by a ghost or a familiar spirit</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">357</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Chronicles 33:6. Here too the same reasoning as in the previous note applies.</i> and it is further written, <i>and they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">358</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Kings 17:17. Here likewise it would seem that “passing through the fire” was a form of witchcraft, something different from the worship of Molech. But see the following note.</i> [these verses indicating that the rite of “passing through the fire” was some form of witchcraft], and the Molech was an idol to which they offered little children.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">359</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Accordingly, in line with the plain meaning of Scripture we would say that the rite of “passing through the fire” was something different from the burning of the victim to Molech. But since we have found it written etc. (see text).</i> But since we have found it written, <i>that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">360</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Kings 23:10.</i> [which shows clearly that “passing through the fire” was in connection with the worship of Molech], the words of our Rabbis that all forms of worshipping Molech were by fire, have been shown to be trustworthy. But it is [also] possible [as the verses indicate] that they used this rite for false divination and to prophesy by means of it, according to their foolishness, these being the prophets of Baal who would first offer to him sacrifices of children, and then have vain dreams and <i>a lying divination</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">361</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 13:7.</i> Therefore the Torah associates the matter of the Molech with that of [the various kinds of] divination. For here [in the Book of Leviticus] it placed [the subject of the Molech] immediately before <i>the soul that turneth unto the ghosts, and unto the familiar spirits</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">362</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 20:6.</i> and in the Book of Deuteronomy<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">363</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 18:9-14.</i> the whole section is devoted to the subject of those who predict the future falsely.<br>Now Scripture [here in the verse before us] states that the act of passing children through the fire to Molech constitutes a profaning of G-d’s Name,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">364</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse here concludes, <i>Neither shalt thou profane the Name of thy G-d</i>.</i> and in the other section [i.e., in <i>Seder Kedoshim</i>] it adds, <i>to defile My Sanctuary, and to profane My Holy Name</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">365</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 20:3.</i> Perhaps the meaning thereof is as follows: [To give of one’s children to Molech is] “<i>to defile</i> the people that is sanctified to My Name, whom I commanded, <i>Sanctify yourselves, and be ye holy, for I the Eternal, Who sanctify you, am holy;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">366</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a combination of two verses, Above, 11:44 and further, 21:8.</i> — <i>And to profane My holy Name</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">365</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 20:3.</i> when they commit this serious sin before Me.” For thus He speaks of the serious sins, such as, <i>and a man and his father go unto the same maid, to profane My holy Name</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">367</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Amos 2:7.</i> It is possible that He says so [<i>to defile My Sanctuary</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">365</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 20:3.</i> in connection with the Molech], because a father who sacrifices of his seed to Molech and afterwards comes into G-d’s Sanctuary to bring an offering, defiles the Sanctuary, as his offerings are defiled and are an abomination to G-d, and he himself is forever defiled, having become impure by the evil he did; just as He said of [those who turn to] the ghosts and the familiar spirits, <i>seek them not out, to be defiled by them</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">368</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 19:31.</i> and it is further written, <i>and because they had defiled it with their idols</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">369</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 36:18.</i> And He also mentions [in connection with the Molech] the profaning of G-d’s Name [as it says, <i>and to profane My holy Name</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">365</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 20:3.</i>], because when the nations hear that he honored the Molech with his seed, and to G-d he brought an offering of his cattle, it will be a profaning of G-d’s Name. It is concerning this that the prophet Ezekiel said, <i>and their sons, whom they bore unto Me, they have also made them pass through unto them to be devoured. Moreover this they have done unto Me: they have defiled My Sanctuary in the same day</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">370</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 23:37-38.</i> And the prophet continues, <i>For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into My Sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of My house</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">371</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 39.</i><br>By way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], Israel <i>the holy seed</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">372</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 6:13.</i> is born in the house of G-d, this being the meaning of the expression <i>whom they bore unto Me</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">373</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 23:37.</i> Thus he who sacrifices one of G-d’s people to the Molech, defiles G-d’s Sanctuary and profanes His Great Name, similar to the expression, <i>And he</i> [i.e., the High Priest] <i>shall not profane his seed among his people</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">374</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 21:15.</i> It is for this reason that He said [of the person who gives of his seed to Molech], <i>And I will set My face against that man</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">375</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 20:3.</i> [and again], <i>Then will I set My face against that man</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">376</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 5.</i> The student learned in the mystic lore of the Cabala will understand."

Rather, the use of the expression, <i>Behold, ‘shachavti’</i> (<i>I lay</i>) <i>yesternight with my father</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">379</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 19:34.</i> is due to the fact that it was Lot’s daughters who, through lying with him, [were instrumental in that affair] in order to beget seed of him.

And so also did He say in the second section [i.e., in <i>Seder Kedoshim</i>], <i>and I have set you apart from the peoples, that ye should be Mine</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">396</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 20:26.</i> which is [the basis for] the strict prohibition against idolatry. Therefore He stated that it is because they are dedicated to His Name that He gave them the Land, as it is said, <i>And I have said unto you: ‘Ye shall inherit their Land, and I will give it unto you to possess it’ … I am the Eternal your G-d, Who have set you apart from the peoples</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">392</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 24.</i><br>Now outside the Land of Israel, although it all belongs to <i>the Glorious Name</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">381</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 28:58.</i> yet its purity is not perfect, because of “the servants” who hold sway there, and the nations go astray after their princes to worship them as well. It is for this reason that Scripture states, <i>the G-d of the whole earth shall He be called</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">397</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 54:5.</i> since He is the G-d of gods Who rules over all, and He will in the end <i>punish the host of the high heaven on high</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">398</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 24:21.</i> removing the celestial powers and demolishing the array of “the servants,” and afterwards He will punish <i>the kings of the earth upon the earth</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">398</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 24:21.</i> This is the meaning of the verse stating, <i>The matter is by the decree of ‘irin’</i> (<i>the wakeful ones</i>), <i>and ‘sh’elta’</i> (<i>the sentence</i>) <i>by the word of the holy ones</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">399</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Daniel 4:14.</i> meaning, the matter that was decreed on Nebuchadnezzar [that he be driven from men and eat grass as oxen etc.] is the pronouncement of the guarding angels and the sentence of the word of the holy ones, who have ordained on the powers emanating from them that it be so. They [the angels] are called <i>irin</i> [literally: “the wakeful ones”], because from their emanations proceed all the powers that stir all activities, similar to that which it says, <i>and behold ‘ir’</i> (<i>a wakeful one</i>) <i>and a holy one came down from heaven. He cried aloud, and said thus: ‘Hew down the tree</i> etc.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">400</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 10-11.</i> — [In the verse] <i>And ‘sh’elta’</i> (<i>the sentence</i>) <i>is by word of the holy ones</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">399</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Daniel 4:14.</i> [the word <i>sh’elta</i>] is like <i>sha’alu</i>, meaning first “they ask” what is the will of the Supreme One about it, and afterwards they decree that it be so done. It is with reference to this that Daniel told Nebuchadnezzar, <i>it is the decree of the Most High</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">401</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 21.</i> for everything is from Him, blessed be He.<br>Thus <i>the Glorious Name</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">381</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 28:58.</i> blessed be He, <i>is G-d of gods</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">386</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 10:17.</i> in the whole world, and G-d of the Land of Israel which is <i>the inheritance of the Eternal</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">402</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 26:19.</i> This is the meaning of the expression, <i>and he will go astray after the foreign gods of the Land</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">403</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 31:16.</i> for the gods are foreign to the Land of G-d and His inheritance. This is what Scripture means when it states [of the Cutheans who were settled by the king of Assyria in the cities of the kingdom of Israel], <i>they knew not the manner of the G-d of the Land; therefore He hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the G-d of the Land</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">404</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Kings 17:26. The verse is thus stating that they did not live in the Land in a way befitting its special characteristic as G-d’s inheritance — hence the phrase “the G-d of the Land.”</i> Now the Cutheans were not punished in their own land when they worshipped their gods, by G-d sending lions among them, but only when they came into the Land of G-d and conducted themselves as before, did He send lions among them who slew them. And so the Rabbis taught in the Sifra:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">405</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifra <i>Kedoshim</i> 11:14.</i> “<i>And the Land vomit not you out also</i> etc.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">406</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 28.</i> The Land of Israel is unlike other lands; it is unable to contain sinners.” And in the Sifre we find that the Rabbis taught:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">407</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifre <i>Ha’azinu</i>, 315.</i> “<i>And there was no strange god with Him</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">408</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 32:12.</i> [when He took Israel out of Egypt, and protected them during their wandering through the wilderness], so that none of the princes of the nations should have power to come and exercise authority over you, something like that which it is said, <i>and when I go forth, lo, the prince of Greece shall come</i>, etc.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">385</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 20.</i> This is the meaning of the saying of the Rabbis:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">409</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kethuboth 110 b.</i> “Whoever lives outside the Land, is as if he had no G-d, for it is said, <i>I am the Eternal your G-d, Who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, to be your G-d</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">410</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 25:38.</i> and it is further said, <i>for they have driven me</i> [David] <i>out this day that I should not cleave unto the inheritance of the Eternal, saying: Go, serve other gods</i>.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">411</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 26:19. “And who told David, <i>‘Go, serve other gods?’</i> This can only mean to teach you that he who lives outside the Land is like etc.’” (Kethuboth). Having been forced to leave the Land, David was thus justified in saying that those responsible for it had, as it were, said to him, “Go, etc.”</i> And in the Tosephta of Tractate Abodah Zarah the Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">412</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tosephta, Abodah Zarah 5:5. On the name Tosephta, see in <i>Seder Tazria</i> Note 124.</i> “Now it is said, <i>And I</i> [Jacob] <i>will come back to my father’s house in peace, then shall the Eternal be my G-d</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">413</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 28:21.</i> and it is further said, <i>to give you the land of Canaan, to be your G-d</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">410</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 25:38.</i> When you are in the land of Canaan I am your G-d. When you are not in the land of Canaan, I am not your G-d if it were at all possible to say so [for He is our G-d under all circumstances and in all places]. Similarly it is said, <i>about forty thousand ready armed for war passed on in the presence of the Eternal unto battle</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">414</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 4:13.</i> and it is further said, <i>and the Land is subdued before the Eternal, and before His people</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">415</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Chronicles 22:18.</i> But how could it enter one’s mind that Israel subdued the Land before the Eternal [as if to say that they captured it for His sake]? But [this teaches that] as long as they are upon the Land, it is as if it were subdued [before Him, since He is their G-d, as explained above], but when they are not upon it, it is not subdued.”<br>It is on the basis of this matter that the Rabbis have said in the Sifre:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">416</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifre <i>Eikev</i>, 43.</i> “<i>And ye perish quickly from off the good Land</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">417</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 11:17. The following verse continues: <i>And ye shall lay up these My words in your heart and in your soul</i> etc. This clearly indicates even as the Sifre teaches, that after banishment from the Land they are to continue the observance of the commandments.</i> Although I banish you from the Land to outside the Land, make yourselves distinctive by the commandments, so that when you return they shall not be novelties to you. This can be compared to a master who was angry with his wife, and sent her back to her father’s house and told her, ‘Adorn yourself with precious things, so that when you come back they will not be novelties to you.’ And so did the prophet Jeremiah say [to the people in exile in Babylon], <i>Set thee up waymarks</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">418</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 31:20.</i> These are the commandments, by which Israel is made distinctive.” Now the verses which state, <i>and ye perish quickly … and ye shall lay up these My words</i> etc.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">419</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 11:17-18.</i> only make obligatory in the exile [the observance of those commandments] affecting personal conduct, such as the [wearing of] phylacteries and [placing of] <i>Mezuzoth</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">420</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A parchment on which is written Deuteronomy 6:4-9, and 11:13-21, and which is fastened to the right door-post. See further in Vol. II, p. 173.</i> [these being specifically mentioned there in the following words of Scripture], and concerning them the Rabbis [in the above text of the Sifre] explained [that we must observe them] so that they shall not be novelties to us when we return to the Land, for the main [fulfillment] of the commandments is [to be kept] when dwelling in the Land of G-d. Therefore the Rabbis have said in the Sifre:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">421</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifre <i>R’eih</i>, 80.</i> “<i>And ye shall possess it, and dwell therein. And ye shall observe to do all the statutes</i> etc.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">422</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 11:31-32.</i> Dwelling in the Land of Israel is of equal importance to all the commandments of the Torah.” A similar statement is also found in the Tosephta of Tractate Abodah Zarah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">423</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tosephta, Abodah Zarah 5:3.</i> This in fact was the thought of the wicked ones who [misusing the intention of the above statement], said to the prophet Ezekiel [whose prophetic activity was in the Babylonian exile]:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">424</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 105 a.</i> “Our master Ezekiel, if a servant is sold by his master, does the master still have any claim to him?”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">425</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, “since G-d sold them to Nebuchadnezzar and banished them from before Him, does He still have any claim upon them?” (Rashi <i>ibid.</i>). The answer was that they were never “sold” since the exile was merely a form of temporary punishment for their sins, and therefore, <i>and that which cometh into your mind</i> etc. (see text).</i> For it is said, <i>and that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all; in that ye say: We will be as the nations, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">426</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 20:32.</i> And this was the command of our patriarch Jacob <i>to his household, and to all that were with him</i>, at the time that they came into the Land, <i>Put away the strange gods that are among you, and purify yourselves</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">427</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 35:2.</i> And G-d, <i>by Whom</i> alone <i>actions are weighed</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">428</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See I Samuel 2:3.</i> [brought it about] that Rachel died on the way when they started coming into the Land,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">429</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 35:16-19. See in Vol. I, pp. 330-332, where Ramban refers briefly to this problem, namely why Jacob married two sisters in their lifetime, and then concludes that “he married them only outside the Land.” Here Ramban completes the thought, by explaining that G-d, by Whom events are decided, therefore brought about the death of one of the sisters as soon as they came into the Land. The reason why Rachel had to die and not Leah, is explained in the text.</i> for on account of her own merit she did not die outside the Land, and for Jacob’s merit, he could not dwell in the Land with two sisters [in their lifetime, since this is forbidden in the Torah, and the laws of the Torah were observed by our ancestors in the Land of Israel even before the Torah was given on Sinai], and she [Rachel] was the one by whose marriage the prohibition against two sisters took effect [since Jacob was already married to Leah]. It would appear that Rachel became pregnant with Benjamin before they came to Shechem, and while in the Land Jacob did not touch her at all, for the reason that we have mentioned. And the prophet states, <i>And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double; because they have profaned My Land; they have filled Mine inheritance with the carcasses of their detestable things and their abominations</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">430</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 16:18.</i> This matter [i.e., that the Land of Israel is the inheritance of the Eternal and thus cannot tolerate sinners] is found in many places in the Scriptures, and you will see it clearly after I have opened your eyes to it.<br>Now Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented in the section of <i>Vayeilech:</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">431</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 31:16.</i> “We know that G-d is One, and changes arise because of those who receive [His beneficent deeds], but G-d does not change His deeds, as they are all done in wisdom. And included in the worship of G-d is to guard the ability to receive [His beneficence] according to the place [so that if a particular place is holier than others, one must observe there more strictly the laws of holiness]. Therefore it is written [of the Cutheans, that they did not know] <i>the manner of the G-d of the Land</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">432</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Kings 17:26. The Cutheans were thus punished for not being heedful of the holiness of the Land of Israel which is unable to retain worshippers of idols.</i> and of Jacob it is said [when he came into the Land he told his household], <i>put away the strange gods</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">427</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 35:2.</i> and the extreme opposite of [the sanctity of] the place [i.e., the Land of Israel] is indulging in forbidden sexual relationships, as they are [sins of the] flesh. The student versed [in the mysteries of the Torah] will understand.” Thus are the words [of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra] of blessed memory.<br>Now do not refute me [in what I have written above, that Israel is under the direct guidance of G-d alone, and no celestial power determines their fate], by citing the verse, <i>Michael your prince</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">433</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Daniel 10:21.</i> for he is only a ministering angel who implores mercy for Israel, but is in no way a prince exercising any royalty or power. So was also <i>the captain of the host</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">434</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 5:14.</i> who appeared to Joshua at Jericho, showing him that G-d had sent him to fight their battles, similar to [that which happened in the days of] Hezekiah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">435</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Kings 19:35: <i>And it came to pass at that night, that the angel of the Eternal went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians</i> etc.</i> Besides, this matter [of Michael imploring mercy for Israel] was when we were already outside the Land of Israel.<br>Now I do not have permission to explain on the subject of <i>ha’aretz</i> (“the earth” or “the Land”) more than this.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">436</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban is alluding to the word <i>ha’aretz</i>, which is mentioned here repeatedly: <i>vatitma ha’aretz … vataki ha’aretz</i> (literally: “and the earth was defiled … and the earth vomited out”). This hints at the first <i>ha’aretz</i>, mentioned in the first verse of Creation, which Ramban has already explained in many places as referring to “the higher earth,” to which the souls finally return after their sojourn on the lower earth.</i> But if you will merit to understand the first “earth” mentioned in the verse of <i>Bereshith</i> (<i>In the beginning G-d created the heaven and the earth</i>), and also the one mentioned in the section of <i>Im Bechukothai</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">437</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 26:42. <i>v’ha’aretz ezkor</i> (literally: “and the earth I will remember”).</i> you will know a profound and sublime secret, and you will further understand what our Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">438</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tanchuma, <i>Vayakheil</i> 7.</i> “The Sanctuary on high is exactly opposite the Sanctuary below.” I have already alluded to this on the verse, <i>for all the earth is Mine</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">439</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 19:5.</i> Now Scripture mentions that the people of the land of Canaan were punished on account of their immoral [sexual] deeds. And our Rabbis have said that they were warned about these matters from the time of creation, when these laws were declared to Adam<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">440</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 56 b. Rambam in the Mishneh Torah, <i>Hilchoth Melachim</i> 9:1, puts it as follows: “The first man was commanded concerning six matters: idolatry, blasphemy, bloodshed, incest, robbery, etc.”</i> and to Noah,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">441</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Incest is counted among the Seven Laws of the Noachides (see Vol. I, p. 417, Note 148).</i> for He does not punish unless He admonishes first. Scripture, however, did not state the admonition, but instead said that the Land would vomit them out, for the Land abhors <i>all these abominations</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">442</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 27.</i> Now the Canaanites were not the only ones who were admonished about these matters [for since these laws were declared to Adam and Noah, they applied to all mankind], and the Scriptural section mentions specifically, <i>After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">443</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 3.</i> which proves that the Egyptians also did all these abominations, and yet the land of Egypt did not vomit them out, nor did the lands of other nations vomit them out! Rather, this whole subject shows the distinction of the Land [of Israel] and its holiness [so that it alone is unable to retain sinners]. Scripture states, <i>and the Land vomited out</i> [using a past tense, although the Canaanites were still living there], for from the time that He was to punish [them] for the sins committed upon her [i.e. the Land], having decreed destruction upon the Canaanites, it is as if the Land had already vomited them out. Or it may be that the expression, <i>and the Land vomited out</i> is a reference to above, similar to what is said, <i>their defense is removed from over them</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">444</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 14:9.

                    "AND THE SOULS THAT DO THEM SHALL BE CUT OFF FROM AMONG THEIR PEOPLE. “His offspring is cut off, and his [own] days are shortened.” This is Rashi’s language.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">445</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 17:9.</i> Now in the matters of excision mentioned in the Torah there are three different expressions. One is that which states, <i>that man shall be cut off;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">446</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 4 and 9. This form of expression is found in connection with slaughtering or bringing offerings outside the Sanctuary Court.</i> a second one is that which says, <i>and the souls which do them shall be cut off</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">447</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Verse 29 before us, in connection with forbidden sexual relationships.</i> or <i>that soul shall be cut off from before Me;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">448</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 23:3 in connection with eating of the holy offerings in a state of impurity. It is also found as a punishment for eating forbidden fat (above, 7:25), blood (<i>ibid.</i>, 17:10) etc.</i> and a third form of expression is that which states, <i>that soul shall utterly be cut off, his iniquity shall be upon him</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">449</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 15:31. In connection with idol worship and blasphemy.</i> Now of a [a person doing work on] the Day of Atonement Scripture states, <i>that soul will I destroy from among his people</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">450</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 23:30.</i> and on this the Rabbis commented in the Sifra:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">451</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifra. <i>Emor</i> 14:4.</i> “Excision is mentioned in many places in Scripture. But I do not know what it is. Now that it says, <i>and I will destroy</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">450</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 23:30.</i> it teaches that excision means ‘destruction’ [of the soul].”<br>The explanation of the subject is as follows. If someone eats forbidden fat or blood and he is [still] a righteous person whose merits outweigh [his sins], but he could not control his desire for it, and thus stumbled in this sin, his days will be shortened and he will die in his youth before reaching old age, which is sixty years,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">452</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“At sixty a man attains old age” (Aboth 5:24).</i> but his soul is not destined for destruction;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">453</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For although in the case of eating forbidden fat or blood Scripture does state <i>that soul shall be cut off</i> (see Note 448 above), yet since the merits of this man outweigh his sins, his soul will not be destroyed. In other words, the punishment of destruction of the soul applies only if his sins outweigh his merits, as a result of his having eaten forbidden fat or blood, as explained further on in the text.</i> rather, its portion will be in the World of Souls<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">454</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See in Vol. II, p. 65, Note 12.</i> in accordance with the person’s good deeds, since he was a righteous man, and he will also have a portion in the World to Come, which is the world after the resurrection. Of this case it is said, <i>that man shall be cut off</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">446</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 4 and 9. This form of expression is found in connection with slaughtering or bringing offerings outside the Sanctuary Court.</i> But [in the case of] one who, as a result of this grave sin, now has more sins [in gravity] than his merits, the punishment of excision for this weighty transgression affects the soul that sins after it is separated from the body, and it is cut off from life in the World of Souls.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">454</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See in Vol. II, p. 65, Note 12.</i> It is with reference to those liable to this form of excision that Scripture alludes, in saying, <i>that soul shall be cut off from before Me</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">448</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 23:3 in connection with eating of the holy offerings in a state of impurity. It is also found as a punishment for eating forbidden fat (above, 7:25), blood (<i>ibid.</i>, 17:10) etc.</i> And it is further written [in this connection], <i>that soul will I destroy from among his people</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">450</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 23:30.</i> These sinners do not suffer bodily excision [as is the case in the first type mentioned above], but may sometimes live to reach many days, even old age and hoary heads, as it is written, <i>and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his evil-doing</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">455</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ecclesiastes 7:15.</i> It is this which our Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">456</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rosh Hashanah 17 a.</i> “But he whose sins outweigh his merits, including a non-Jew<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">457</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“<i>A Jew</i> who sins with his body” is also mentioned there in the Talmud in this connection. But that is defined there as “the head (of him) that puts on no <i>Tefilin</i> (phylactery).” It may be that Ramban omitted mentioning this here, since his essential intention is to explain the types of excision mentioned in Scripture, which fit in with the example mentioned further on in the text, since the punishment for immorality is expressly stated even for the Canaanites.</i> who sins with his body — and Rav Papa said that this refers to a particular sin, that is to say, one who commits incest with one of the forbidden relations — these descend to Gehenna and they are punished for twelve months; after twelve months their bodies are destroyed, and their souls burnt, and the winds scatter [their ashes] under the soles of the feet of the righteous etc.” And there is a still more stringent form of excision, where both the body is cut off [from life in this world] and the soul [even from life in the World to Come]. It is of this [third kind of excision mentioned above] that it is said, <i>Because he hath despised the word of the Eternal, and hath broken His commandment, that soul ‘hikareith tikareith’</i> (<i>shall be utterly cut off</i>), <i>his iniquity shall be upon him</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">449</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 15:31. In connection with idol worship and blasphemy.</i> And the Rabbis interpreted it:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">458</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shebuoth 13 a.</i> “<i>‘Hikareith’</i> (<i>he shall be cut off</i>) in this world; <i>‘tikareith’</i> (<i>he shall be cut off</i>) in the World to Come,” meaning to say that he shall die in his youth, and his <i>life shall be as that of the depraved</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">459</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 36:14.</i> in that his soul will not share in the life after the resurrection and he will have no portion in the World to Come. This double expression of excision is not stated in the Torah except in matters of idolatry and blasphemy. Our Rabbis have further interpreted in Tractate Shebuoth:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">458</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shebuoth 13 a.</i> “<i>Because he hath despised the word of the Eternal</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">449</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 15:31. In connection with idol worship and blasphemy.</i> This refers to one who throws off the yoke, [i.e., he denies the essential principle of the religion], and perverts the sense of the Torah. <i>And he hath broken His commandment</i>. This is one who breaks the covenant of the flesh” [i.e., circumcision]. But this does not apply to all cases where excision is mentioned, it being explained there in the Gemara<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">458</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shebuoth 13 a.</i> that the double expression of <i>‘hikareith tikareith’</i> (<i>he shall utterly be cut off</i>)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">449</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 15:31. In connection with idol worship and blasphemy.</i> does not apply to all other people who are liable to excision by law of the Torah, except for those derived by interpretation of this verse; since this verse refers to a blasphemer and a worshipper of idols, and the Rabbis added by interpretations, those who deny the essential principle [of G-d’s existence], and those hardened wicked ones [mentioned above]. This is similar to that which is said of them in the tradition,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">460</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew word is <i>kabalah</i>, and it is here used as a term referring to the books of the Scriptures which come after the Five Books of Moses, because they are words of “tradition” received from the prophets.</i> <i>for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">461</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 66:24.</i> These are the ones who are enumerated in the Mishnah<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">462</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 90 a.</i> and in the Beraitha:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">463</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tosephta, Sanhedrin Chapter 13.</i> “And these are they that have no share in the World to Come.” And so also it appears, that not all those liable to excision are punishable by the death of their offspring, except for those where the word <i>aririm</i> (childless) is mentioned.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">464</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 20:20-21.</i> And it is possible that all forbidden [sexual] relationships have been likened to each other [in this respect of the punishment, namely death of the offspring], but in the case of other sins for which excision is incurred, such as for eating forbidden fat and blood, we do not have [this aspect of punishment].<br>Now Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">465</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 23:30.</i> “There is a difference between <i>‘v’ha’avad’ti’</i> (<i>and I will destroy</i>)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">450</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 23:30.</i> and <i>‘v’nichr’thah’</i> (<i>it shall be cut off</i>),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">448</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 23:3 in connection with eating of the holy offerings in a state of impurity. It is also found as a punishment for eating forbidden fat (above, 7:25), blood (<i>ibid.</i>, 17:10) etc.</i> and I could not explain.” The learned scholar [Rabbi Abraham] thought that the soul that is “destroyed” is destroyed for ever, and the one that is “cut off” is denied life for a time, <i>and yet doth G-d not take away life</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">466</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Samuel 14:14.</i><br>Know and understand that the forms of excision mentioned with reference to the soul, constitute a great [source for] trust in the existence of souls after death, and the granting of reward in the World of Souls.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">454</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See in Vol. II, p. 65, Note 12.</i> For in His saying, blessed be He, <i>and that soul shall be cut off from among his people</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">467</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 15:30.</i> <i>or that soul shall be cut off from before Me</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">448</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 23:3 in connection with eating of the holy offerings in a state of impurity. It is also found as a punishment for eating forbidden fat (above, 7:25), blood (<i>ibid.</i>, 17:10) etc.</i> it denotes that <i>the soul that sinneth</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">468</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 18:20.</i> shall be cut off in its iniquity, but other souls that did not sin, will exist before Him in the splendor on high. It is for this reason that He explains, <i>that soul … its iniquity shall be upon it</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">469</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 15:31.</i> for it is the sin that is in it which will cause it to be cut off. And the meaning of the matter is that <i>the soul of man is the lamp of the Eternal</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">470</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 20:27.</i> which has been breathed into our nostrils<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">471</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Genesis 2:7.</i> <i>out of the mouth of the Most High</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">472</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lamentations 3:38.</i> and <i>the spirit of G-d</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">473</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 33:4.</i> as it is said, <i>And He breathed into his nostrils the breath of life;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">471</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Genesis 2:7.</i> and so it remains in its [original] state and does not die [with the death of the body], for it is not a composite [of the four elements] so that it be subject to the law of existence and decomposition, as are all components. But the existence of the soul is fitting [for all time], living forever as do the Separate Intelligences.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">474</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Another name for “the angels.” See in Vol. II, p. 292, Note 313.</i> Therefore Scripture did not need to state that as a reward for [fulfillment of] the commandments the soul will exist [after the death of the body, for it is self-understood that it will exist from a knowledge of the nature of the soul], but instead it states that as a punishment for sins, the soul will be desecrated and defiled, and become cut off from its proper existence. This is the sense of the expression <i>kareth</i> (cutting off) which the Torah uses, intimating that it is like a branch cut off from the tree, from the roots of which it derives its nourishment. It is this which our Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">475</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifre <i>Shelach</i>, 112.</i> “<i>From among his people</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">450</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 23:30.</i> — but his people are in peace.” For the cutting off of <i>the soul that sinneth</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">468</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 18:20.</i> proves the existence of all other souls that do not sin, these being <i>his people</i> [mentioned in the verse] which are in peace. And we have already explained<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">476</sup><i class=\"footnote\">At the beginning of <i>Seder Va’eira</i>.</i> that all assurances of the Torah, whether for reward or punishment, are all miraculous in nature, and are of the type of hidden miracles,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">477</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Vol. I, p. 215, Note 372, and pp. 556-557.</i> the Torah always promising [certain blessings] in a non-natural manner [which result not from the processes of nature, but because of the observance of the law], and warning against [consequences which result not from the processes of nature, but as punishment for our violation of the law]. Therefore He warned here of <i>kareth</i> which is of a miraculous nature [since in the natural order of things the soul should exist forever], and did not promise the eternal existence of the soul [as a reward for observance of the commandments], since that is its natural state.<br>Now there are thirty-six sins<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">478</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kerithoth 2 a.</i> for which the Torah prescribed excision as a punishment, many of them being in connection with prohibitions of forbidden sexual relationships, that is to say, forbidden sexual intercourse. Similarly, punishments of death imposed by the court for forbidden sexual intercourse, are sixteen.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">479</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These are listed by Rambam in his Mishneh Torah, <i>Hilchoth Sanhedrin</i> 15:10-11.</i> But there is no death penalty at all for eating forbidden foods. The reason why these great punishments, such as death by the court and excision [by Heaven] are [imposed] for forbidden sexual relationships, is because immorality is something very abhorrent to the Torah, as is mentioned in this section and in many places of Scripture. The Sages always mention<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">480</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As in Aboth 5:11, Sanhedrin 74 a, etc.</i> “idolatry, immorality, and bloodshed” [as being the three gravest sins], mentioning immorality after idolatry and before bloodshed [thus showing the greatness of the sin, in that it is mentioned immediately after idolatry]. This is like that which the Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">481</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 106 a.</i> “The G-d of these people [i.e., the Israelites] abhors lewdness.” There is also one of the great secrets of creation in this matter.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">482</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See above, Verse 6.</i> And the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] wrote in the Moreh Nebuchim:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">483</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Guide of the Perplexed III, 41. The quotation is not verbatim but expresses the gist of the thought.</i> “Because man’s temptation to sexual intercourse is great, and because of the strong [natural] desire for it, which can cause many stumblings, a great punishment was needed in order to discipline people.” This also is true.<br>Kedoshim"

(b) Since these laws are so fundamental, men, women, and children were all present when Moses addressed them, whereas in the other sections of the Torah only the elders and the men were present.</i> this being the reason for the expression, <i>speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel</i>. This section, however, was mentioned here in [the book of] <i>Torath Kohanim</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “the Law of the Priests,” which is another name for the Book of Vayikra, or Leviticus. In other words, since the laws of this section are so fundamental to the entire congregation of Israel, why were they placed in the book which is essentially devoted to the laws of the priests and the offerings? The answer follows in the text.</i> because it contains laws concerning the thanks-offering,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Tur, quoting the language of Ramban, writes: “peace-offerings.” That is correct, since the following verses [5-8] refer only to the peace-offerings, and not the thanks-offering. There are important differences between them. A thanks-offering may be eaten only on the same day that it was slaughtered until midnight, whilst a peace-offering could be eaten for two days and the intervening night. Therefore Verses 6 and 7, speaking of permission to eat the offering for two days, could not possibly refer to the thanks-offering.</i> and also because it states the punishments<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Chapter 20.</i> He commanded us to execute on those who do the abominable deeds mentioned [in the preceding sections], as well as [those for] the forbidden sexual relationships. These subjects have been included in this book [of <i>Torath Kohanim</i>] for the reason that we have written at the beginning of this book.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ramban’s introduction to this book where he writes: “As a result of mentioning these laws, He warned afterwards about forbidden sexual relationships etc.”</i>",
                    "YE SHALL BE HOLY. “Abstain from the forbidden sexual relationships [mentioned in the preceding section] and from [other] sin,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">So explained in Gur Aryeh on Rashi.</i> because wherever you find [in the Torah] a warning to guard against immorality, you find the mention of ‘holiness.’” This is Rashi’s language. But in the Torath Kohanim I have seen it mentioned without any qualification [i.e., without any particular reference to immorality, as Rashi expressed it], saying:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, at beginning of <i>Seder Kedoshim</i>.</i> “Be self-restraining.” Similarly, the Rabbis taught there:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid., Shemini</i> 12:4.</i> “<i>And ye shall sanctify yourselves, and be ye holy, for I am Holy</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 11:44.</i> Just as I am Holy, so be you holy. Just as I am Pure, so be you pure.” And in my opinion, this abstinence does not refer only to restraint from acts of immorality, as the Rabbi [Rashi] wrote, but it is rather the self-control mentioned throughout the Talmud, which confers upon those who practice it the name of <i>P’rushim</i> (Pharisees), [literally: “those who are separated” from self-indulgence, as will be explained, or those who practice self-restraint]. The meaning thereof is as follows: The Torah has admonished us against immorality and forbidden foods, but permitted sexual intercourse between man and his wife, and the eating of [certain] meat and wine. If so, a man of desire could consider this to be a permission to be passionately addicted to sexual intercourse with his wife or many wives, and be <i>among winebibbers, among gluttonous eaters of flesh</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 23:20</i> and speak freely all profanities, since this prohibition has not been [expressly] mentioned in the Torah, and thus he will become a sordid person within the permissible realm of the Torah! Therefore, after having listed the matters which He prohibited altogether, Scripture followed them up by a general command that we practice moderation even in matters which are permitted, [such as in the following]: One should minimize sexual intercourse, similar to that which the Rabbis have said,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Berachoth 22 a.</i> “So that the disciples of the Sages should not be found together with their wives as often as the hens,” and he should not engage in it except as required in fulfillment of the commandment thereof. He should also sanctify himself [to self-restraint] by using wine in small amounts, just as Scripture calls a Nazirite “holy” [for abstaining from wine and strong drink],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 6:8.</i> and he should remember the evils which the Torah mentioned as following from [drinking wine] in the cases of Noah<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 9:21.</i> and Lot.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 19:33.</i> Similarly, he should keep himself away from impurity [in his ordinary daily activity], even though we have not been admonished against it in the Torah, similar to that which the Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chagigah 18 b.</i> “For the <i>P’rushim</i> (Pharisees), the clothes of the unlearned are considered as if trodden upon by a <i>zav</i>” [or <i>zavah</i> — a man or woman having suffered a flux], and just as the Nazirite is called “holy” because of guarding himself from the impurity of the dead.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 6:6-7.</i> Likewise he should guard his mouth and tongue from being defiled by excessive food and by lewd talk, similar to what Scripture states, <i>and every mouth speaketh wantonness</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 9:16.</i> and he should purify himself in this respect until he reaches the degree known as [complete] “self-restraint,” as the Rabbis said concerning Rabbi Chiya,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See my Hebrew commentary p. 116, for different personalities to whom this character trait has been ascribed in Rabbinic sources. I have not found a clear source for Ramban’s version here.</i> that never in his life did he engage in unnecessary talk. It is with reference to these and similar matters that this general commandment [<i>Ye shall be holy</i>] is concerned, after He had enumerated all individual deeds which are strictly forbidden, so that cleanliness of hands and body, are also included in this precept, just like the Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Berachoth 53 b.</i> “<i>And ye shall sanctify yourselves</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 11:44.</i> This refers to the washing of hands before meals. <i>And be ye holy</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 11:44.</i> This refers to the washing of hands after meals [before the reciting of grace]. <i>For I am holy</i> — this alludes to the spiced oil” [with which they used to rub their hands after a meal]. For although these [washings and perfuming of the hands] are commandments of Rabbinic origin, yet Scripture’s main intention is to warn us of such matters, that we should be [physically] clean and [ritually] pure, and separated from the common people who soil themselves with luxuries and unseemly things. And such is the way of the Torah, that after it lists certain specific prohibitions, it includes them all in a general precept. Thus after warning with detailed laws regarding all business dealings between people, such as not to steal or rob or to wrong<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 25:17.</i> one another, and other similar prohibitions, He said in general, <i>And thou shalt do that which is right and good</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 6:18.</i> thus including under a positive commandment the duty of doing that which is right and of agreeing to a compromise [when not to do so would be inequitable]; as well as all requirements to act “beyond” the line of justice [i.e., to be generous in not insisting upon one’s rights as defined by the strict letter of the law, but to agree to act “beyond” that line of the strict law] for the sake of pleasing one’s fellowman, as I will explain when I reach there [that verse], with the will of the Holy One, blessed be He. Similarly in the case of the Sabbath, He prohibited doing certain classes of work by means of a negative commandment,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 20:10.</i> and painstaking labors [not categorized as “work,” such as transferring heavy loads in one’s yard from one place to another, etc.] He included under a general positive commandment, as it is said, <i>but on the seventh day thou shalt rest</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 23:12.</i> I will yet explain this<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See further, 23:24.</i> with the help of G-d.",

From the words of Scripture: <i>Of thy people thou shalt not curse</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 22:27.</i> If so, why does it state [here] ‘the deaf’? It is to teach us that ‘the deaf’ has been singled out by Scripture [here] because [although he is unable to hear and feel hurt], he has the characteristic of being alive, thus exluding [from the scope of this prohibition] the dead [who, though they are like the deaf in their inability to hear and feel hurt], are unlike them in being no longer alive.” This is Rashi’s language, and so it is taught in the Torath Kohanim.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Kedoshim</i> 2:13.</i> But the interpretation of the Gemara<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 66 a.</i> is not so. Rather, Scripture first warned against [cursing] the dignitaries of the people, the judge or ruler, saying, <i>Thou shalt not curse ‘elohim’</i> (<i>the judges</i>) <i>nor curse a ruler of thy people</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 22:27.</i> Then it gave another admonition [here] against cursing the unfortunate ones of the people, like the deaf, and from them [i.e., from both classes of people, the distinguished and the unfortunate] we learn by a general proposition that we must not curse anyone of the rest of the people, since from beginning to end [from “the ruler” to “the deaf”] they are all included in this prohibition.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus the prohibition against cursing anybody is not, as Rashi stated, derived from the phrase <i>of thy people thou shalt not curse</i>, but is rather based on the two prohibitions against cursing a ruler and the deaf, which include the highest stratum of the people as well as the unfortunate ones, and everyone else is naturally included in between these two categories.</i> And the word <i>b’amcha</i> (of thy people — <i>a ruler ‘of thy people’</i>) is interpreted [by the Gemara] to mean<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 85 a.</i> only those who conduct themselves in the manner <i>of thy people</i>, thus excluding the wicked.<br>According to the plain meaning of Scripture, the verse mentions cursing the deaf [in order that we may deduce] that if in the case of one who cannot hear and will not become incensed by the curse, the Torah nonetheless admonished against cursing him, how much more so [is it prohibited to curse] one who hears and feels the insult, and will become hot-tempered because of it! Moreover, Scripture always admonishes against doing that which is frequent, for a person is inclined to curse the deaf and put a stumbling-block before the blind since he does not fear them, because <i>they know not, neither do they understand</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 82:5.</i> Therefore [it states here], <i>and thou shalt fear thy G-d</i>, Who sees the secret things.

It was this snack that was called ‘the eating of <i>kurtzin</i>,’ [the word being associated with] the [Hebrew] expression, <i>‘koreitz’</i> (<i>he that winketh</i>) <i>with his eyes</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 6:13.</i> for such is the manner of all who go about slandering, to wink with their eyes, and to insinuate slanderous matters in order that [others who happen to] hear them should not understand them.” All this is the language of the Rabbi [Rashi].<br>But his explanation of this rendition of Onkelos has neither rhyme nor reason.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See in Volume I, p. 100, for a similar remark.</i> For one who listens to a slanderer does not swear to him that he will believe his words, and [therefore the slanderer] need not give him a sign or token [to believe him]! Even when one slanders a servant to his master,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Proverbs 30:10: <i>Slander not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty</i>. Ramban’s intention is therefore as follows: Even in slandering a slave, where the slanderer runs the risk of incurring his curse, the master nonetheless gives the slanderer no assurance that he will listen to him, and so what sense is there to this “eating” on the part of the slanderer which Rashi mentioned?</i> the master does not assure him that he will listen to him, and so what sense is there to this “eating” [by the slanderer, as Rashi mentioned]? And Nebuchadnezzar did what he decided to do on the basis of his own decision about the righteous ones,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This refers back to the proof Rashi mentioned above from the Book of Daniel 3:8, where it is said <i>‘va’achalu kartzeihon’ of the Jews</i>, and it is told that certain slanderers came and informed Nebuchadnezzar that Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, were not bowing to his image of gold. As a result he called them and asked them if it was true. When they told him that they had no intention ever of bowing to his image of gold, he had them thrown into a burning furnace. But when they were saved by an act of G-d from the fiery furnace, the king had it proclaimed that no one must henceforth speak against the G-d of these righteous ones. — Ramban now points out that when accepting the words of the slanderers, we find no reference to the king’s offering them any food, a custom which Rashi mentioned as having been the basis for this expression <i>va’achalu kartzeihon</i>. Furthermore, as is evidenced from the story, he did not even believe them at first, for he called Hananiah etc. and asked about it. And yet Scripture says <i>‘va’achalu kartzeihon’ of the Jews</i>, which shows that this whole interpretation of Rashi in Onkelos’ translation of the verse is not borne out by Scripture.</i> and He did not offer food to the slanderers [to establish the veracity of their report], neither did he swear to them [that he would believe them], nor did he in fact believe them. Instead, he asked [of the righteous ones], <i>Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego</i> etc.,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">72</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Daniel 3:14. Shadrach, Meshach, etc. were the Babylonian names that the chief of officers gave to Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah (<i>ibid.</i>, 1:7).</i> and he commanded that if henceforth they were to bow to the image of gold that he had made, he would forgive them for their transgressions in the past! [All this shows that <i>va’achalu kartzeihon</i> does not refer to a meal eaten by the slanderers, to serve as the final confirmation that their slander was well-grounded, since in the case of Nebuchadnezzar, where this expression occurs, the king did not accept their report!] Nor did King Darius offer food to the slanderers of Daniel,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">73</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 6:12-14.</i> except for <i>the wormwood and the gall</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">74</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lamentations 3:19.

Instead, the essential meaning of the Aramaic expression here [i.e., <i>lo theichul kurtzin</i>, is not a prohibition against “eating <i>kurtzin</i>,” but] is only a term for the act of making a sound, this usage being common in the language of the Sages:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">76</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Baba Bathra 5 a. The story there is told that Ravina had land on all four sides of a field belonging to a man called Runya. When Ravina put up a fence on all four sides separating his fields from that of Runya, the latter refused to pay his share of the expense. Thereupon Ravina at the time of the harvest said to his field laborer, “Bring me a cluster of grapes from Runya’s field when he is present there.” When he was about to do it Runya rebuked him, shouting, “Put it back.” Ravina then said to Runya: “Now you have shown that you are satisfied with the fence I have made. Even if only goats came into your field, would you not need to shout at them? Would you not need to hire a person to shout at them? [Hence you must share in the expense of the fence].”</i> “And even if it were but goats, would they not <i>achluyei michlulei</i> (have to be shouted at)? And would you not have [to hire] a person <i>l’achluyei</i> (to shout) at them?” Jonathan [ben Uziel] translated: <i>Cry aloud</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">77</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 58:1.</i> — <i>‘achlei;’ and ‘He will hiss’ unto them from the end of the earth</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">78</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 5:26.</i> — <i>‘v’yachlilei;’ ‘and they shall roar’ against them like the roaring of the sea</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">79</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 5:30.</i> — <i>‘v’yachlei’</i> against them. Similarly [Jonathan has translated] in many places. Thus the term <i>achal</i> [in Aramaic] denotes every form of making sound, whereby one makes his wish known without uttering words. Therefore this term was used [by the Sages, as mentioned above] to describe one who shouts at goats that enter a field, and [Jonathan used the same term in translating the Hebrew for] hissing,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">78</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 5:26.</i> roaring<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">79</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 5:30.</i> and crying aloud.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">77</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 58:1.</i> Now the way of talebearers is to come amongst a multitude of people, or before a ruler, and utter sounds in a guttural manner, and wink with their eyes, in order to hint that they have heard certain important matters until they press upon them that they tell them. This is why [talebearers in Aramaic] are called <i>ochlei kurtzin</i>, meaning “those who roar with hints.” And Onkelos who translated [the Hebrew] <i>rechiluth</i> (talebearing) [as <i>theichul kurtzin</i> — muttering hints], rendered into Aramaic the idea of the Hebrew, and was not particular to explain the precise meaning of the Scriptural expression. Such is always his style, since his intention is to make the subject understandable [and not necessarily to translate literally]. But in the Sacred Language talebearers are called <i>holchei rachil</i>, from the expressions, <i>all powders of the ‘rachil’</i> (<i>merchant</i>)<i>;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">80</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Song of Songs 3:6.</i> <i>‘rechulatheich’</i> (<i>thy merchandise</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">81</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 26:12.</i> For the <i>rocheil</i> (peddler) goes about the whole day, buying merchandise in various other places, just as the Sages mention,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">82</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Maasroth 2:3.</i> “peddlers that go around from town to town,” [and similarly the <i>holchei rachil</i> carry tales as if they were merchandise, from place to place]. And this is the sense of the word <i>b’amecha</i> (among thy people) — <i>Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer ‘among thy people’</i> — since the talebearer walks among many people. To differentiate between the two [the talebearer and the peddler], the talebearer was called <i>rocheil</i>, in a verbal form, [as the term <i>rocheil</i> can also signify the act of talebearing], while the peddler was called <i>rachil</i>, which is an adjectival noun denoting the person himself, just like <i>saris</i> (chief), <i>nazir</i> (a Nazirite), the name <i>rachil</i> thus hinting that peddling is of his essence, and is an act which reflects upon his person."

Following these commandments He then said [in the following verse] that you are to love your neighbor. Thus he who hates his neighbor violates a negative commandment, and he who loves him, fulfills a positive commandment.<br>The correct interpretation appears to me to be that the expression <i>‘hochei’ach tochiach’</i> (<i>thou shalt surely rebuke</i>), is similar to <i>‘V’hochiach Avraham’</i> (<i>And Abraham reproved</i>) <i>Abimelech</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">85</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 21:25.</i> The verse here is thus stating: “do not hate your brother in your heart when he does something to you against your will, but instead you are to reprove him, saying, ‘Why did you do thus to me?’ and you will not bear sin because of him by covering up your hatred of him in your heart and not telling him, for when you will reprove him, he will justify himself before you [so that you will have no cause to hate him], or he will regret his action and admit his sin, and you will forgive him.” After that He admonishes [in the following verse] that you are not to take vengeance of him, nor bear a grudge in your heart against him because of what he has done to you, for it is possible that he will not hate him, but yet he will remember in his heart his neighbor’s sin against him; therefore He admonished him that he is to erase his brother’s sin and transgression against him from his heart.

Moreover, Rabbi Akiba has already come and taught,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">86</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Baba Metzia 62 a. This teaching applies to a case where “two people are together on a journey and one has a pitcher of water; if they both drink from it they will die, because there is not enough for both, but if only one will drink he will survive. Ben Petura taught that it is better that both should drink and die, rather than that one should see the death of the other. [This was held to be the law] until Rabbi Akiba came and taught: <i>that thy brother may live with thee</i> (further, 25:36), thy life takes precedence over the life of thy brother.”</i> “Your life takes precedence over the life of your fellow-being.” Rather, the commandment of the Torah means that one is to love one’s fellow-being in all matters, as one loves all good for oneself.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">87</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus: “he is to speak in praise of his neighbor, and be as careful of his neighbor’s property as he is careful of his own property, and be as solicitous of his neighbor’s honor as he is of his own” (Rambam, Mishneh Torah, <i>Hilchoth Mada</i>, 6:3).</i> It is possible that since it does not say “and thou shalt love <i>‘eth rei’acha’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">88</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In that case the command would have been to love the <i>person</i> of one’s neighbor as much as one loves one’s own self.

Here too the thought conveyed is: “that which is good for the proselyte you should love, as if it were good for your own self.”</i> that the meaning thereof is to equate the love of both [himself and his neighbor, or himself and the proselyte] in his mind. For sometimes a person will love his neighbor in certain matters, such as doing good to him in material wealth but not with wisdom and similar matters. But if he loves him completely, he will want his beloved friend to gain riches, properties, honor, knowledge and wisdom. However [because of human nature] he will still not want him to be his equal, for there will always be a desire in his heart that he should have more of these good things than his neighbor. Therefore Scripture commanded that this degrading jealousy should not exist in his heart, but instead a person should love to do abundance of good for his fellow-being as he does for himself, and he should place no limitations upon his love for him. It is for this reason that it is said of Jonathan’s [love for David], <i>for he loved him as he loved his own soul</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">90</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 20:17.</i> because Jonathan had removed [altogether] the attribute of jealousy from his heart, and he said [to David], <i>and thou shalt be king over Israel</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">91</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 23:17.</i> etc.<br>Our Rabbis have already explained<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">92</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifra, <i>Kedoshim</i> 4:10-11.</i> the matters of taking vengeance and guarding a grudge [which are here forbidden], that they apply to cases where there is no monetary obligation, such as, “Lend me your sickle, lend me your hatchet.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">93</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If he answers, “I will not lend it to you, just as you refused to lend it to me,” that is vengeance. But if he answers, “yHere it is; I am not like you, who would not lend it to me,” that is bearing a grudge.</i> For in a case where his friend owes him money, such as because of damage that he caused him or for similar reasons, one is not obliged to let his friend go free.

But our Rabbis have not mentioned that the reasons for the commandments [mentioned in this verse] are hidden from us, and that the evil inclination and the idolaters raise objections against them, except in [the case of the prohibition against] wearing a garment made of wool and linen, but not in the case of mating of animals of diverse kinds [for which there is a reason, as will be explained later on].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">95</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And so why did Rashi mention this prohibition of mating diverse kinds of cattle, as an example of a “statute.” when the Rabbis never mentioned it as such?</i> And the intention of the Rabbis [in defining “statutes” as the laws of the King for which there is no reason] was not that these are decrees of the King of kings for which there are no reasons whatever, <i>for every word of G-d is tried</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 30:5.</i> [They meant] only that “statutes” are like the enactments which a king promulgates for his kingdom, without revealing their benefits to the people, and the people, not sensing these reasons, entertain questions about them in their hearts but they accept them nonetheless out of fear of the government. Similarly, “the statutes” of the Holy One, blessed be He, are His secrets in the Torah, which the people by means of their thinking do not grasp as they do in the case of <i>mishpatim</i> [“ordinances” — laws which conform to the human conception of justice], but yet they <i>all</i> have a proper reason and perfect benefit.<br>Now the reason for [the prohibitions against] <i>kilayim</i> [“mixed kinds,” as will be explained further on], is that G-d has created in the world various species among all living things, both plants and moving creatures, and He gave them a power of reproduction enabling them to exist forever as long, as He blessed be He, will desire the existence of the world, and He further endowed them with a power to bring forth [only] after their kind, and that they should never be changed, as it is said with reference to all of them [at the time of Creation], <i>after its kind</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">97</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 1:11, 21, 24.</i> This driving force in the normal mating of animals is for the sake of preserving the species, even as human beings engage in sexual activity for the sake of having children. Thus one who combines two different species, thereby changes and defies the work of Creation, as if he is thinking that the Holy One, blessed be He, has not completely perfected the world and he desires to help along in the creation of the world by adding to it new kinds of creatures. Moreover, the mating of diverse species of animals does not produce offspring, and even in the case of those that are by nature close to each other [such as the horse and the ass], from which offspring are born, such as mules, their seed is cut off, for they themselves [the mules] cannot produce offspring. Thus from the point of view of these two matters [i.e., the changing in the order of Creation and the sterility of the product, we see that] the act of combining different species is despicable and futile. Even when diverse species of vegetation are grafted together, their fruits do not reproduce afterwards, and they too are prohibited because of the two above-mentioned reasons [for the prohibition of mixing different species together]. This is the meaning of the prohibition [stated here in the verse], <i>thou shalt not sow thy field with two kinds of seed</i>, which in the opinion of our Rabbis<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">98</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kiddushin 39 a.</i> constitutes a prohibition against grafting [diverse kinds of trees, or trees and vegetables, and is not a prohibition against merely sowing together diverse kinds of seed].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">99</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This interpretation is based upon the fact that Scripture states, <i>thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind; thou shalt not sow thy field with two kinds of seed</i>. By placing these two prohibitions together, Scripture is teaching that just as in the case of cattle, the verse refers to well-definable objects [cattle], so in the case of sowing the field, Scripture refers to well-definable objects — trees, vegetables, etc., — and is not a mere prohibition against sowing diverse kinds of seed [although that too is forbidden], since these are not yet distinguishable.</i> But He has prohibited also the mere sowing together of diverse kinds of seed, because their nature and form change when they derive nutrition from each other, and thus each kernel of it is as if it were grafted together from two kinds. Similarly, He has forbidden to plow with an ox and an ass together,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">100</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 22:10.</i> because it is customary among tillers of the soil to bring their working animals into one cattle-shed, and there they might come to mate with a diverse kind.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">101</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This reason is also stated by Maimonides in the Guide of the Perplexed, III, 49 (p. 267 in Friedlander’s translation).</i> And one of our colleagues<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">102</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This thought which appears in the following text is expressly mentioned in the commentary on the Songs of Songs ascribed to Ramban but actually authored by Rabbi Ezra, one of the chief Cabalists of the period (see my introduction to this book in Kithvei Haramban, Vol. II, p. 474). Ramban’s expression here “and one of our colleagues etc.” thus clearly indicates that there was a group of scholars in Gerona who were dedicated to the study of the Cabala; and Ramban was one of that group. — Several points worthy of note are to be made with this expression “one of our colleagues.” It indicates the reticence with which the study of Cabala was regarded at that time. For even when crediting the thought to another scholar Ramban avoids identifying him by name. The role of Rabbi Ezra as one of the leading Cabalists at that period is indeed an undefined one, although it is known for a certainty that his influence was far-reaching. Additionally, the term <i>chaveireinu</i> (our colleague) indicates the closeness with which the group kept together, so that anyone who was part of them was called a <i>chaveir</i> (a colleague). The expression “one of our colleagues” may perhaps also indicate that Rabbi Ezra and Ramban were regarded as equals, for otherwise he would have referred to him as a teacher or master.</i> adds to the reason for the prohibition against mixing seeds, that it is in order not to throw into disorder the primary forces which bring about the growth of the plants, when they derive nutrition from each other,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">103</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A sense of the importance of ecology, of maintaining a proper well-ordered relationship between the primary forces of nature, is clearly discerned here.</i> as is indicated in the saying of our Rabbis in Bereshith Rabbah:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">104</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Bereshith Rabbah 10:7. See Vol. I, pp. 40, 70-71, where the same text is quoted.</i> “Said Rabbi Simon: There is not a single kind of herb that does not have a constellation in heaven which smites it and says to it, ‘Grow.’ It is with reference to this that Scripture says, <i>Knowest thou ‘chukoth shamayim’</i> (<i>the statutes of heavens</i>)? <i>Canst thou establish ‘mishtaro’</i> (<i>the dominion thereof</i>) <i>in the earth?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">105</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 38:33.</i> — [<i>mishtaro</i> being derived from the root <i>shoter</i> (executive officer)].” Now he who grafts diverse kinds of plants or sows seeds of diverse kinds with the intention that they derive nutrition from each other, thereby destroys <i>‘chukoth shamayim’</i> (<i>the statutes of heavens</i>). This is why He has said, <i>Ye shall keep ‘chukothai’</i> (<i>My statutes</i>), as they are the statutes of the heavens. And so did Rabbi Chanina in the name of Rabbi Pinchas say,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">106</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Vayikra Rabbah 35:4.</i> that [the statutes mentioned here in the verse] are because of “the statutes with which I formed My world.” I have already written in the section of <i>Bereshith</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">107</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 2:8.

                    "NEITHER SHALL THERE COME UPON THEE A GARMENT ‘KILAYIM SHA’ATNEIZ’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">109</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “mixed of two kinds of stuff.”</i> (MIXED OF LINEN AND WOOL). “Why is this stated [here, since in Deuteronomy 22:11 quoted further on it is more explicitly stated]? But because it is said [there in Deuteronomy], <i>Thou shalt not wear ‘sha’atneiz’</i> (<i>a mingled stuff</i>), <i>wool and linen together</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">110</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 22:11.</i> I might think that one is not to wear [loose pieces of] wool-shearings and stalks of flax; Scripture therefore states, <i>a garment</i>, [thus excluding from the terms of the prohibition the wearing of loose pieces of wool and flax which have not been woven together into a garment]. Whence do I know to include felted stuff [of linen and wool, which, though not spun and woven, are pressed into one material and worn as a garment]? Scripture therefore says, <i>sha’atneiz</i> — that which is <i>shu’a</i> (combed), <i>tavui</i> (spun) and <i>nuz</i> (twisted) together. And I say that the word <i>nuz</i> is an expression for materials which are compressed and twined one with the other to be joined [into a coherent web].” This is Rashi’s language.<br>But it does not appear to me to be correct, for felted stuff [of linen and wool] is not forbidden by law of the Torah, but only by enactment of the Rabbis, since it is only combed [but not spun and twisted, so why then did Rashi include it under the term <i>sha’atneiz</i>,] since that word implies all three actions — combing, spinning and twisting? And so we have been taught in a Mishnah:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">111</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kilayim 9:9.</i> “Felted stuff [of wool and linen] is forbidden because it is combed,” [which clearly indicates that it is not spun and twisted]. And in the Gemara the Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">112</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Niddah 61 b.</i> “Perhaps I might say [that Scripture prohibited wool and linen if they were] only combed, or spun, or twisted!” And the Gemara came to the conclusion: “The final law is as Mar Zutra [who said that this Scriptural prohibition applies only if all three acts were done], since the Merciful One expressed them all in one term” [<i>sha’atneiz</i>, which as mentioned above is a combination of three words: <i>shu’a</i> (combed), <i>tavui</i> (spun) and <i>nuz</i> (twisted)]. But the Beraitha taught in the Torath Kohanim, stating:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">113</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Kedoshim</i> 4:18.</i> “I know only that a garment [must not be worn if made of wool and linen together]. But whence do I know to include felted stuff? From that which the verse states, <i>sha’atneiz</i>” — that Beraitha intends to include things which are not “a garment,” on the basis of the verse <i>Thou shalt not wear a mingled stuff</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">110</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 22:11.</i> since the word “garment” is not mentioned there, [but it does not intend to teach, as Rashi interpreted it, that wool and linen even if only combed but not spun and twisted, are already forbidden as <i>sha’atneiz</i>]. This interpretation [of the Torath Kohanim] is a basic principle, since even an article which is not “a garment” [if worn as a vestment] is also forbidden by law of the Torah to be made of wool and linen, such as where one plaits threads [of wool and linen] and makes of them a belt, or anything similar, providing only that the threads were combed, spun and twisted. The Torath Kohanim mentioned “felted stuffs” merely as a Biblical support for a Rabbinical enactment, since these are forbidden only by the law of the Rabbis, as they are not “a garment” [because the two diverse materials are only combed, but not spun and twisted].<br>Similarly, in respect of that which the Rabbi [Rashi] wrote with reference to combing, that [the wool and linen] must also be compressed and twisted together, and in a similar manner he also wrote in his commentaries to the Gemara,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">114</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yebamoth 5 b; Niddah 61 b. See my Hebrew commentary p. 122.</i> other scholars,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">115</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tosafoth, Yebamoth 5 b.</i> have already commented that Rashi’s interpretation is not in accord with what the Rabbis have said [in the following text of the Talmud]:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">116</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Menachoth 39 a. To understand the following text it is necessary to clarify these two points: (a) The commandment of <i>Tzitzith</i> (Fringes) consists of making for each of the four corners of the garment four threads specially woven for that purpose. They are then passed through a hole situated a few thumbs’ breadth away from each of the four corners, the threads are doubled, and two knots are then formed at the lower edge of the garment, followed by a series of windings and other double knots (see “The Commandments,” Vol. I, p. 22, for precise details). (b) A cardinal principle in Torah law is that, subject to certain general exceptions, any duty of fulfilling a positive commandment overrides a negative commandment (see Ramban on Exodus 20:8 — Vol. II, pp. 309-310). This is derived from the juxtaposition of these two verses: <i>Thou shalt not wear a mingled stuff, wool and linen together. Thou shalt make twisted cords upon the four corners of thy covering, wherewith thou coverest thyself</i> (Deuteronomy 22:11-12). The closeness of the two verses intimates that the commandment of Fringes overrides the prohibition of <i>sha’atneiz</i>, so that the Fringes may be made with threads of wool even if the garment itself is of linen. — The Gemara now argues on the basis of the second principle mentioned, that we must say that the upper knots [formed at the lower edge of the garment] after the four threads are passed through the opening and doubled, are obligatory by law of the Torah, “for should you think etc.”</i> “You must deduce from this<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">117</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., from the fact that the Torah intimated a special permission showing that the commandment of the Fringes overrides the prohibition of wearing <i>sha’atneiz</i> (see Note 116 (b)).</i> that the upper knots<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">118</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Knots.” The Hebrew is <i>kesher</i> — “knot” in the singular. But Ramban himself further on refers to “two knots” which are made at the lower edge of the garment. Basically, however, it is the first knot with which we are concerned, since if the threads are of wool and the garment of linen, and they are joined together with only one knot, which holds them together, nonetheless the prohibition of <i>sha’atneiz</i> would be incurred by wearing them afterwards, were it not for the fact that in that case the Torah especially permitted it.</i> in the Fringes are required by Scriptural law. For if you should think that they are not required by Scriptural law, why then did the Merciful One have to state a [special] permission for using mingled stuff of wool and linen in Fringes! Do we not hold the law to be established that if one fastens two pieces together with only one stitch, it is not considered joined!”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">119</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hence if the commandment of the Fringes required merely the passing of the four threads through the hole, and then doubling them, without tying them with a knot, there would have been no need for the Torah to intimate a special permission for <i>sha’atneiz</i> in Fringes, since the woolen threads and linen garment would not be considered “joined together.” But if, on the other hand, after the threads are passed through the opening and are doubled they must then be tied with a knot, that constitutes already an act of joining the woolen Fringes and the linen garment together, which ordinarily would render it forbidden to be worn, and then we would understand that in the case of the Fringes, the Torah had to intimate a special permission. — Thus far is the reasoning of the Talmud. Ramban now deduces from it, that in order to be included in the prohibition of <i>sha’atneiz</i> it is not necessary that the wool and linen themselves be combed, spun and twisted together, as Rashi had written.</i> Thus the Rabbis [of the Talmud] have revealed to us that a garment made of linen, in which woolen fringes have been tied with two knots, constitutes diverse kinds by law of the Torah, even though they have not been compressed and twined together!<br>Rather, the matter is as follows: Scripture here stated, <i>Neither shall there come upon thee a garment ‘kilayim sha’atneiz,’</i> meaning to say that every garment that is made of a <i>thread</i> which has been combed, spun and twisted, we should not wear if it is <i>kilayim</i>, that is, of mingled stuff. And in the Book of Deuteronomy He explained in addition that we should not wear anything which was combed, spun and twisted of wool and linen if they be together, that is to say, if the wool and linen are joined together with [at least] two stitches. This means to say that [even] if the wool and linen were each combed, spun and twisted separately, they may not be attached together, for when they are joined they constitute <i>kilayim</i> (mingled stuff); just as He said [in the preceding verse there], <i>Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">120</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 22:10. Now just as in this case the prohibition applies to joining together in work an ox and an ass, which are two separate creatures, even so in the verse on <i>sha’atneiz</i> which follows, the prohibition applies only where the <i>thread</i> of wool was treated to all three actions separately, and so also the <i>thread</i> of linen, and then they were both <i>joined</i> together.</i> that is to say, if they are tied and joined to each other. And in the case of garments, fastening with two stitches already constitutes “joining” them, it being derived by the Rabbis from the word <i>together</i> [<i>wool and linen ‘together’</i>] that two stitches constitute a joining together. From there [i.e., from the verse in Deuteronomy where the word “garment” is not mentioned, as it is here in the verse before us], the Rabbis have learned that mingled stuff is forbidden although they are not in a garment, but even if one plaited threads of thick material, and made of them belts, although they were not woven [for a vestment], similar to what we are taught in a Mishnah:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">121</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kilayim 9:9.</i> “One may not tie a cord of wool on to one made of linen, in order to bind up the loins.” And the expression <i>nuz</i> [in the word <i>sha’atneiz</i>] is a shortened word<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">122</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Meaning: “<i>naloz</i> (he preverses) <i>umeiliez</i> (and turns) his Father in heaven against him” (<i>ibid.</i>, 9:8). “The word <i>nuz</i> is thus an expression of perverseness and crookedness, similar to the twisting of threads with each other. It is for this reason that the Merciful One had to permit expressly <i>kilayim</i> in Fringes, since in the case of the Fringes the threads must be twisted” (Ramban in his commentary to Tractate Niddah, 61b). See further in the text before us.</i> in this composite term, just like the word <i>tavui</i> (spun), of which there is only the letter <i>teth</i> [in the word <i>sha’atneiz</i>]. And the meaning thereof [i.e., of the word <i>nuz</i>] is in my opinion like the word <i>naloz</i> (perversing), of the expressions: <i>an abomination to the Eternal is ‘naloz’</i> (<i>the perverse</i>),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">123</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 3:32.</i> meaning he who turns aside and perverses his paths; <i>‘unelozim’</i> (<i>and perverse</i>) <i>in their paths</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">124</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 2:15.</i> meaning those who are crooked and turn aside [unto their crooked ways],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">125</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Psalms 125:5.</i> for anything which is spun [like a thread] is turned and crooked. This is similar to what we are taught in a Mishnah:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">126</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kilayim 9:8.</i> “Rabbi Shimon<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">127</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In our text of the Mishnah: “Rabbi Shimon the son of Elazar.” Ramban’s version, however, suggests that it is Rabbi Shimon the son of Yochai, who is always referred to as “Rabbi Shimon” without further qualification.</i> says: [The meaning of the word <i>sha’atneiz</i> is that he who disregards this law] is perverse and turns his Father in heaven against him,” meaning to say that the Glorious Name turns away His merciful ways from him, similar to what is said, <i>and with the crooked Thou dost show Thyself subtle</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">128</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Samuel 22:27.</i> And in the language of the Sages, this word [<i>naloz</i>] is used in a shortened form, thus:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">129</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shemoth Rabbah 37:2.</i> “This can be compared to a king’s son <i>sh’noz</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">130</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In our text of the Shemoth Rabbah the word is <i>sh’zachah da’ato alav</i> — “whose mind was charged with haughtiness upon him.” Ramban will later on explain the text before us as meaning: “who turned [or perverted] his heart into an evil path.”</i> his heart upon him, and he took a digging tool to undermine his father’s house,” [the word <i>sh’noz</i> meaning] that “he turned his heart to an evil path.” It is of the same root [as the word <i>naloz</i>, in its shortened form <i>nuz</i>], that the Sages have said in the Talmud [in Tractate] Sanhedrin:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">131</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 41 b.</i> “<i>Minizyathei</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">132</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In our text of the Gemara: <i>minezihuthei</i>, which Rashi explains as meaning: “if you had wanted ‘to rail at us’ we could not have answered you at all. But as you spoke kindly, we will tell you many things that we have said about it.” Ramban will explain the text before us [which conforms to the reading of the Munich Talmud manuscript] as meaning: “if you had wanted to turn away the matter from the right course etc.”</i> of the master, we could not have answered him at all,” that is to say, if you had wanted to insist and turn away the matter [from the right course], we would not have known how to answer you at all. <i>Nizyathei</i> is thus like <i>nilzyathei</i>, that is to say, “his turning away” from the correct path. This is the true and correct interpretation in this matter [of <i>sha’atneiz</i>]. It was for this reason that it was necessary for the Torah to grant permission for <i>kilayim</i> (mingled stuff) in Fringes,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">133</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See above, Note 116 (b). Ramban’s intention is that although the woolen <i>Fringes</i> are not plaited or woven together with the <i>cloth</i> of the four-cornered garment, to which they are later attached, nonetheless since the Fringes are <i>themselves</i> combed, spun and twisted, and then attached to the cloth which was likewise combed, spun and twisted, as explained above, that is a sufficient “mingling of stuffs” to constitute <i>sha’atneiz</i>. Hence it was necessary for the Torah to grant permission etc.,</i> although the Fringes are not plaited and do not constitute a garment. This then is the law of the Torah [i.e., if the linen garment was made of threads which were combed, spun and twisted, and the woolen threads were likewise combed, spun and twisted, then these two kinds of threads must not be joined together]. However, the Sages prohibited it even if the threads were only made in one way — either combed, or spun, or twisted. It is for this reason that we have been taught in a Mishnah:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">111</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kilayim 9:9.</i> “Felted stuff [of wool and linen] is forbidden because it is combed. An edging of wool on a linen garment<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">134</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even though the woolen edging is not woven together with the linen garment, but is merely attached to it by some artificial means (Tifereth Yisrael, Kilayim 9:9, Note 46).</i> is forbidden since it interlaces the web of the garment.” All these are prohibited by law of the Rabbis.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">135</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In summary then, two major differences of opinion have appeared between Rashi and Ramban on the law of <i>sha’atneiz:</i> (a) According to Rashi the Scriptural prohibition applies where the wool and linen were <i>either</i> combed, <i>or</i> spun, <i>or</i> twisted. Hence felted stuff which is only combed, is forbidden by law of the Torah. According to Ramban, the Scriptural prohibition applies only where the wool and linen went through the process of all three acts mentioned, and therefore felted stuff which is only combed, is forbidden only by enactment of the Rabbis. (b) According to Rashi the prohibition of <i>sha’atneiz</i> applies where the wool and linen were combed [or spun or twisted] <i>together</i>. According to Ramban, the prohibition applies where the <i>threads</i> of wool were separately combed, spun and twisted, and likewise the <i>threads</i> of linen were combed, spun and twisted, and then they were both attached to each other with a minimum of two stitches, or tied with a knot. — Rambam’s presentation of this law follows that of Rashi, while the Rashba follows that of Ramban.</i><br>Now the reason for the prohibition of mingled stuff in garments is in order to keep far away from the mixing together of different species, and He therefore prohibited [the threads, i.e., of wool and linen] from which garments are usually made. But the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] had said in the Moreh Nebuchim<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">136</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Guide of the Perplexed III, 37.</i> that the reason for the prohibition of wearing a garment made of wool and linen, is because at that time this kind of garment was used by the priests and magicians to adorn themselves when performing their activities, and he [Maimonides] says that he found it so written in their books. And since this was for them a matter of great importance, and very much desired by them in order that they should do their activities [in honor of] the idols and demons, therefore the Torah removed it from being worn by all people, since the Torah intends to blot out their deeds and efface their memory."

                    "AND WHOSOEVER LIETH CARNALLY WITH A WOMAN THAT IS A BONDMAID, ‘NECHEREPHETH’ FOR A MAN — “‘Destined’ for a man. I know not of a similar usage of this root [<i>choraph</i>] in Scripture.” This is Rashi’s language. It appears to me that it is associated with the expression, <i>as I was in the days of ‘chorpi,’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">137</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 29:4.</i> meaning, in the days of my youth. Similarly, <i>my heart shall not ‘yecheraph’ me so long as I live</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">138</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 27:6.</i> meaning that I will not have the heart of a youth [who has not yet matured in wisdom]. The days of youth are called “the days of <i>choreph</i>” [a term which means “winter”], since the winter is at the beginning of the year, while the days of old age correspond to the summer which are the days of gathering in. Scripture, then, is stating here that she is a bondmaid, a young girl designated for a certain man, for a concubine who ministers to a man and with whom he has sexual relations, is called “his maiden,” just as every ministering person is also called [the master’s] lad. It is very common in the language of the Sages to say of a woman who has sexual relations with a man, that she is “an attendant to him.” And it is this [relationship that is here called] <i>necherepheth</i>, meaning that she has become a maiden [— attendant] to a man, and is known to him, called in the vernacular [i.e., in Spanish] <i>mancipada</i> (designated to a man). In the language of the Sages likewise we find the expression:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">139</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 58 b.</i> “that slave’s girl” [assigned to him by his master]. Thus the meaning thereof is that she is not completely as his wife, but he has betrothed her and she is to him a maiden-attendant.",

And if so, Scripture then is warning the court to make this investigation because she is like a married woman, and they might [easily] make a mistake [in deciding his punishment]. But their interpretation does not please me, for it is a fact that is self-understood that the matter will be investigated, and that the court will not kill a person in vain. For they do such an investigation in all cases involving the death penalty!<br>Now it is my opinion that this [word <i>bikoreth</i>] is a unique one in Scripture, but it is a common term in the Aramaic language and in the expressions of our Rabbis, namely, the word <i>hefkeir</i> [“ownerless” — with the letter <i>beth</i> in <i>bikoreth</i> and the letter <i>fei</i> in <i>hefkeir</i> interchanging]. For the word is essentially <i>hevkeir</i> [with the letter <i>veth</i>, which is equivalent to the <i>beth</i> in <i>bikoreth</i>], just as the Rabbis have said [in a Mishnah]:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">141</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Peah 6:1.</i> “The School of Shammai say: <i>Hevkeir</i> [produce that is proclaimed ownerless] for the benefit of the poor [only], is deemed <i>hevkeir</i> [and therefore the produce is free from the obligation to give tithes, since ownerless produce is exempt from tithes].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">142</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus we find the Mishnah using the word <i>hevkeir</i> [with the letter <i>veth</i>] instead of <i>hefkeir</i> [with the letter <i>fei</i>].</i> And the School of Hillel say: [It is not valid] unless the owner makes it equally free for the rich, just as in the Sabbatical year” [when the produce of the field is free for poor and rich alike, and is exempt from tithes]. And again we have been taught [in a Mishnah]:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">143</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shevi’ith 9:4.</i> “One may eat [produce of the Sabbatical year] which has been brought into the house <i>al hamuvkar</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">144</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here too, the Mishnah uses the term <i>hamuvkar</i> instead of <i>hamufkar</i>.

Similarly throughout the Mishnah [the term <i>hefkeir</i>] is written with a <i>veth</i> [i.e., <i>hevkeir</i>]. But in the Gemara they became used to saying <i>hefkeir</i> [with a <i>fei</i>], as these letters [the <i>veth</i> and the <i>fei</i>] were used interchangeably by them, just as from the expression <i>the grains ‘ovshu’</i> (<i>shrivel</i>),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">151</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joel 1:17.</i> they used the word <i>‘ofshu’</i> (musty). This is likewise found in many places in the Scriptures, as I have mentioned on the verse <i>Thou didst blow with Thy wind</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">152</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 15:10.</i> And the interpretation of this verse [before us] is as follows: He says concerning this bondmaid that “although she is ‘attending’ this man, she is not considered his wife because she is to him <i>bikoreth</i>, that is to say, she is treated by him as a loose person, and therefore <i>they are not to be put to death</i> as is the law of the adulterer and the adulteress when the woman is [properly] married; <i>for freedom has not been given to her</i> [from her status as a bondmaid] to be his real wife [and therefore he who lies carnally with her is not to be put to death], but instead he is to bring a guilt-offering because <i>she is designated for a man</i>.” And Onkelos who translated <i>‘bikoreth’ shall be made</i> as “<i>bikurto</i> shall be made,” uses a language similar to that of Yonathan ben Uziel, in his rendition [of the Hebrew <i>ufochazim</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">145</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Judges 9:4.

And if so, <i>‘erel’ of heart</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">154</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 44:9.</i> means “closed of heart,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">155</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is generally translated: <i>uncircumcised in heart</i>.</i> just as it is said, <i>and I will rend the enclosure of their heart</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">156</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hosea 13:8.</i> Similarly, <i>‘areila’ is their ear</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">157</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 6:10.</i> means “their ear is closed and dulled so that no sound enters therein.” And <i>‘aral’ of the lips</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">158</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 6:12.</i> means “closed of lips,” for defective speech is a result of an impediment and obstruction in the veins of the tongue, or sometimes in those of the lips, which have not been properly opened. Speech is referred to in Scripture by the term “opening,” thus: <i>Open thy mouth for the dumb</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">159</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 31:8.</i> [which means, “speak up in the cause of the dumb”]<i>; Job opened his mouth;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">160</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 3:1.</i> <i>and the opening of my lips shall be right things;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">161</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 8:6.</i> <i>keep the doors</i> [literally: “openings”] <i>of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">162</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Micah 7:5.</i> Now Scripture uses the expression “closing up” with reference to the fruit of the first three years, so as to prohibit the deriving of any benefit from it, although it does not express it in this way with reference to other things from which we are also forbidden to derive any benefit [e.g., diverse kinds in a vineyard].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">163</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 22:9.</i> This is because the appearance of the fruit in its earliest stage is called “opening,” just as it is said, <i>the vine-blossom has opened</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">164</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Song of Songs 7:13.</i> Therefore He said, <i>three years shall it be ‘areilim’ unto you</i>, as if the fruits are closed up in the trees, and have not put forth buds nor opened blossoms.<br>The reason for this commandment is to honor the Eternal with the first of all our produce of the fruits of the tree and the increase of the vineyard, and that we are not to eat of them until we bring all the fruit of one year [i.e., the fourth year after the planting] <i>for giving praise unto the Eternal</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">165</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 24.</i> Now the fruit of the first three years is not fit to be brought before <i>the Glorious Name</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">166</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 28:58.</i> because it is small; neither does the tree in its first three years impart good taste or flavor into its fruit. Besides, most trees do not bring forth fruit at all until the fourth year. Therefore we are to wait with all of them [an equal period of time], and are not to taste of their fruit until we have brought of the planting which we have done, all its first good fruit to be holy before G-d, and there [in Jerusalem] we are to eat it and praise the Name of the Eternal. Thus this commandment is like that of the first-fruits.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">167</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 26:1-11.</i> It is furthermore true that the fruit which comes forth from the tree when it is first planted, contains an abundance of moisture which attaches to and is harmful to the body and it is not good to eat it, just like a fish which has no scales and all food, forbidden by the Torah, which are harmful also<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">168</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ramban above, 11:13, and 17:11, that the harm is chiefly to the soul of the person. This is the intention of Ramban’s expression here that the forbidden foods are “also” harmful to the body.</i> to the body.<br>The Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] also gave in the Moreh Nebuchim the same type of reason for this commandment as he gave for most of these commandments, namely, that the magicians and sorcerers of those days used to practice certain deeds of witchcraft at the time of the planting of the trees, thinking that by so doing they would accelerate the coming out of the fruits before their natural time, and when the fruits appeared, they would offer them to the idol in the name of which that witchcraft was performed. Therefore the Torah commanded that the fruits which come out before three years [after the planting of the tree] should be forbidden [to derive any benefit from], in order that people should not come to practice these evil deeds, for most trees bring forth fruits in the fourth year, and that we are then to eat them before G-d [in Jerusalem], contrary to their eating of them before the idols."

But the Sages say: The word ‘harlot’ refers only to a proselytess, a freed bondwoman, or to one who had intercourse with a man in the nature of fornication. Rabbi Eliezer says: Even if an unmarried man has sexual relations with an unmarried woman, without the intention of thereby making her his wife, this too [is a case of the ‘harlot’].” Similarly the Rabbis have said<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">184</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Terumah 29 b.</i> with reference to the prohibition, <i>Thou shalt not bring the hire of a harlot … into the House of the Eternal</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">185</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 23:19.</i> that this has no application whatever to an unmarried woman. But the Beraitha taught in the Torath Kohanim<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">186</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifra, <i>Kedoshim</i> 7:1.</i> [which is the source for Rashi’s interpretation] and which is also mentioned in Tractate Sanhedrin<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">187</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 76 a.</i> [namely, that the verse before us refers to one who gives his <i>unmarried</i> daughter for immorality], may either be in accordance with the teaching of Rabbi Eliezer [mentioned above] and is not the final decision of the law, or it may be a case of one who gives his [unmarried] daughter for immorality with a person with whom she can contract no marital status, such as with a Cuthean or a slave, or any of those persons [with whom sexual relations are forbidden] by punishment of excision or death by the hands of the court, which is “harlotry” in the opinion of the Sages. It is this which they intended in saying, “[this verse refers to] one who gives his unmarried daughter to a man without the intention of marriage,” that is to say, to a man with whom it is impossible that there be a marital status.<br>Similarly, that which the Rabbi taught there in the Sifra<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">188</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifra, <i>Kedoshim</i> 7:3. This was mentioned here by Rashi.</i> with reference to the expression <i>lest the Land fall into harlotry</i>, that the fruits of the Land will turn faithless [and grow in other places and not in your Land], is a homiletic exposition derived from the word <i>ha’aretz</i> (the Land), since it is not written “lest <i>the people</i> of the Land fall into harlotry.” But the main intention of this expression is [to establish] a second negative commandment, which the author of the “Hilchoth Gedoloth”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">189</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Vol. II, p. 350, Note 70.</i> has already counted in his enumeration of the [three hundred and sixty-five] negative commandments, it being an admonition directed to the man who commits the immoral act and to the daughter herself, that she should not give herself over to immoral relationships. And it is on the basis of this [interpretation of the verse] that the Rabbis have said there in that Beraitha [in Torath Kohanim]: “And similarly she who gives herself over to immoral relationships [transgresses a negative commandment].” And the meaning of the verse is [as follows]: Since a daughter is in the control of her father, and he is permitted “in her youth” [i.e., when she is not yet twelve and a half years old] to betroth her to a man, and to cause her to enter the bridal-canopy, and one who violates or seduces her must pay the fine to the father [thus accordingly we might think that the father is at liberty to allow a man to have an immoral relationship with his unmarried daughter], therefore Scripture explained that he is not permitted to give her to anyone for immoral purposes, admonishing [first] the father [against doing it] by means of a negative commandment. After having admonished the father, He warned also those engaged in the harlotry, the man and the woman.<br>Now Rashi wrote in the section of <i>Emor El Hakohanim:</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">190</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 21:7.</i> “<i>A harlot</i>. This is a woman who has had sexual intercourse with a man who is forbidden to her [as a husband], such as those [whom she may not marry] under the penalty of excision, or a <i>Nathin</i> [a descendant of the Gibeonites<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">191</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word <i>‘Nathin’</i> [literally: givers] derived from the verse in Joshua 9:27 stating that Joshua “gave” the Gibeonites as hewers of wood etc.</i>] or a <i>mamzer</i>” [i.e., a person born from a union which is itself prohibited under the penalty of excision]. Now this comment constitutes an admission on the part of Rashi that the term “harlotry” does not apply where marriage between them would be possible, except that he does include under this term [of “harlotry”] also those that are forbidden by means of a negative commandment [the punishment for which being whipping, such as marriage to a <i>mamzer</i>]. This is also Rashi’s opinion in his commentaries on the Gemara<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">192</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yebamoth 61 a.</i> [i.e., that “harlotry” applies to all cases where he is forbidden to her — even if only under the penalty of whipping]. But this too is not correct, for it is only [by means of intercourse with] those whom she may not marry under the penalty of excision, or a Cuthean or a bondman with whom she can contract no marital status, that she is rendered a “harlot” so that a priest who takes her as his wife is liable to whipping because of [marrying] a harlot; but [as a result of intercourse] with those whom she is prohibited [to marry] by means of a [mere] negative commandment — such as a <i>mamzer</i>, or an Ammonite or Moabite proselyte — she is not rendered a “harlot,” and a priest who takes her as his wife is not liable to whipping. However, [as a result of that forbidden relationship], she becomes disqualified from eating the heave-offering and from marrying a priest.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">193</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus, because of her forbidden relationship with a <i>mamzer</i> etc., if she be a priest’s daughter who ordinarily is permitted to eat of the heave-offering [and the priest’s share the thigh and the breast he receives from an Israelite’s peace-offering] she is now forbidden to eat. Similarly, if she was a priest’s daughter, or a Levites or an Israelite’s, she is henceforth forbidden to marry a priest.</i> For it is written, <i>And if a priest’s daughter be married unto an ‘ish zar’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">194</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “a stranger,” a common man, a Levite or lay-Israelite.

And Onkelos who rendered the verse before us: “thou shalt rise up before him who understands [the knowledge of] the Torah, and honor the face of the aged,” would also seem to agree with this opinion [that <i>zakein</i> is one who “acquired” wisdom]. Yet despite all this, the concluding opinion of the Gemara in accordance with the final decision of the law is not so, for the Rabbis have said [in the Gemara]:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">203</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kiddushin 32 b.</i> “Isi the son of Yehudah says: Any hoary head is included [under the terms of this commandment], and Rabbi Yochanan said: The final decision of the law is as Isi the son of Yehudah interpreted it.” Thus Scripture is commanding [in the first half of the verse] to honor any old man, even the uncultured, that is, the unlearned, and then [in the second half of the verse] it gives another commandment concerning the <i>zakein</i>, that is one who has acquired wisdom, even if he be young and learned. It is possible that this is also the opinion of Onkelos, except that he translated <i>the hoary head</i> as “young and learned” [and hence the <i>first</i> half of his translation reads, “thou shalt rise up before him who understands — the knowledge of the Torah,” meaning even if he is young and learned], since the term <i>zakein</i> [in the <i>second</i> half of the verse, which clearly means “one who has acquired wisdom”] came and indicated that the term <i>hoary head</i> includes all kinds of <i>old age</i>, whether old in the knowledge of the Torah or old in days.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">206</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For otherwise why did the Torah use two different terms: <i>seiva</i> (the hoary head) and <i>zakein</i> (the old man)? Onkelos thus reasoned that since <i>zakein</i> definitely means “he who has acquired wisdom,” it shows that <i>seiva</i> must mean all kinds of old people, whether learned or not learned. Hence in translating the verse he rendered <i>zakein</i> first and then <i>seiva</i>, although in the Hebrew text the order of the terms is the opposite. In short, then, it may be that Onkelos also agrees with the opinion of Isi the son of Yehudah that one must show honor to all kinds of old people, whether aged in the knowledge of the Torah or just aged in years.</i>"

Now Rashi has already written in the section of <i>Acharei Moth</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">219</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i></i> that the Molech is “an idol the name of which is ‘Molech,’ and this was the way in which it was worshipped: he would hand over his child to the priests etc.” But all this does not conform and agree properly with the Gemara’s conclusion<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">220</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 64 a-b.</i> as it appears after deliberation. For according to the opinion of the Sage who says that Molech is an idol [and not a name for a form of witchcraft], the worship thereof was not by passing children through the fire, for if so there was no need at all for Scripture to mention this, [i.e., the passing through fire] since it would be included in the admonition against worshipping the idols [in the manner in which they are usually worshipped], of which there are many general prohibitions in the Torah, and it is also included in the punishment stated in the section <i>If there be found in the midst of thee … man or woman, that doeth that which is evil in the sight of the Eternal thy G-d, in transgressing His covenant, and hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">221</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 17:2-3.</i> Rather, we must perforce interpret [if Molech is the name of a particular idol] that the essential purpose of Scripture in mentioning [this particular form of worship], was only to make one liable for passing one’s children [through fire] even if that particular idol is not ordinarily worshipped in that manner. And thus the Rabbis have said in the Gemara:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">220</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 64 a-b.</i> “And according to the Sage who is of the opinion that Molech is an idol, why did Scripture state [the punishment of] excision in the case of Molech [when it is already included in the general punishment for all idol-worship]? It is to apply it in the case of one who passes his son [through the fire in honor of any idol, even if that idol is] not ordinarily worshipped in that manner.” And the same reasoning applies to the punishment and the admonition which Scripture mentioned with reference to it [this particular form of worship], that they were only necessary [if we hold that Molech is an idol] for the case of one who passed his son [through fire] to an idol which is not normally worshipped in that manner.<br>It would appear that according to this opinion [that the Molech was idol-worship, and that the main reason why Scripture mentioned this particular form of worship was to prohibit and punish the practice thereof even as an abnormal manner of worship of all other idols], that the term “Molech” is not a name for a particular graven image or statute, but is a general name for anything that is worshipped, “anything which you accept as your king and take upon you as your god.” In accordance with this opinion, the children of Ammon called their abhorrence Molech,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">222</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Kings 11:7. The word “abhorrence” is the term of the Rabbis for idols, which we are to abhor. See Deuteronomy 7:26.</i> because he was their king, the term Molech thus being a general name for all things honored [as deities], for it is derived from the term <i>malchuth</i> (royalty). It is thus not like the Rabbi [Rashi] said [in the preceding section of <i>Acharei Moth</i>], that Molech is “an idol the name of which is ‘Molech,’ and the manner of its worship” was as mentioned. Similarly, that which Rashi wrote here that the phrase <i>to go astray after the Molech</i> “is necessary to include any other idol that was worshipped in that way, even if that particular idol is ordinarily not worshipped in that way” — this interpretation too, is impossible [to accept] for the reason that we have mentioned, namely, that the essential basis for the punishment of excision mentioned specifically in the case of the Molech, is to make one liable for practicing before an idol even if the idol is not ordinarily worshipped in that manner, and this includes all idols! [Hence it is not necessary to include them on the basis of the phrase before us in Verse 5 — <i>to go astray after the Molech</i> — when this point is already established the overall statement of excision mentioned in Verse 3 which essentially prohibits that kind of worship to any idol, even if it is not normally worshipped in that way]! It is also impossible to say that Scripture made one liable to excision in the case of that idol the name of which is “Molech,” although passing a child through the fire before it was not its usual mode of worship, and that then it reverts [in the verse before us, stating <i>to go astray after Molech</i>, in order, as Rashi said] to include in the punishment of excision he [who passes through the fire of his seed] to Peor or Merkulis [which was also an abnormal mode of worshipping them]. For why was it necessary for Scripture to mention it [i.e., Molech] altogether? Why was that idol [called “Molech” or “Peor” or “Merkulis”] different from all other idols [since the Torah has already prohibited passing one’s children through fire before any idol, under punishment of excision even if that particular idol is ordinarily not worshipped that way]? Moreover, if so you would need a special verse to include one who passes his child through the fire to Peor or Merkulis in the punishment of stoning [if there were witnesses to his act and he was given the proper warning], just as Scripture [according to Rashi] included him in the punishment of excision [when there were no witnesses]!<br>Rather, [we must conclude] that Scripture only mentioned the admonition, and the punishments of excision and stoning, in the case of Molech, with reference to one who passes his child through the fire to any idol whatsoever, even if that is not its usual mode of worship. Thus whether you say that the term Molech is a name for all idols [since the name is derived from the word <i>malchuth</i>, (royalty)] as we have explained, or whether you say [as Rashi does] that Molech is the name of a particular idol that was so called, [we must say, as explained above] that Scripture mentioned it [in order to prohibit this practice even] if it be an abnormal mode of worship [of that idol, i.e., Molech]; the same law applying to all idols, for this stringency is on account of the frightfulness of this mode of worship. All this is made clear in the Gemara of Tractate Sanhedrin<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">220</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 64 a-b.</i> according to this opinion which the Rabbi [Rashi] wrote, that the Molech was an idol. But our Mishnah [which mentions first “the idolator” and then “he that offers of his seed to Molech,” thus indicating that Molech is not an idol, for otherwise this would have been included under the law of “the idolator”],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">223</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This point is clearly made in the Gemara in Sanhedrin 64 a, in commenting on the Mishnah.</i> is taught in accordance with the opinion of the Sage who says that Molech was not an idol, meaning to say, it was not worshipped in a manner of being accepted as a god, but instead it was like a practice of witchcraft, to <i>seek on behalf of the living unto the dead</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">224</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 8:19.</i> unto <i>this dead dog</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">225</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Samuel 16:9.</i> According to this opinion, one who passed his seed through the fire to Peor or Merkulis, is not liable [since that form of witchcraft was performed only before Molech, and the Torah specifically mentioned that this practice of witchcraft was done before Molech].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">226</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If Molech is held to have been an idol, then, as explained in Ramban above, there was no need for the Torah to prohibit and punish its practice specifically, since it was included in the many general prohibitions against idolatry. We were therefore forced to say that the reason why the Torah specifically mentioned Molech and its practice, was to prohibit that practice to any idol, even if that particular idol was not normally worshipped in that way. Also, the term “Molech” must be an expression not for a particular idol, but for any idol, the word being of the root <i>malchuth</i> (royalty), as the act of idol worship meant that the idolator accepted the idol as his god. But if Molech is held to have been a form of witchcraft [and not a mode of idol worship], then if one is to perform that practice before Peor or Merkulis, it would not come under that specific prohibition which the Torah singled out, and hence he would be free from the punishment of death, although — needless to state — he has committed a heinous sin.</i> Rashi’s words in his commentaries to Tractate Sanhedrin<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">227</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi, Sanhedrin 64 a. See my Hebrew commentary p. 129, where this text of Rashi is quoted.</i> are also as we have written. And the Beraitha taught in the Torath Kohanim<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">228</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Kedoshim</i> 10:15.</i> [which was the source for Rashi’s comment mentioned at the beginning of this verse]: “<i>And I will cut him off, and all that go astray after him, to go astray after Molech</i>. This is intended to include the case of any other idol [which was worshipped in that way, that the worshipper is liable to the punishment of] excision” — the interpretation of this Beraitha is not based upon the redundant expression <i>to go astray after Molech</i>, as appears from the words of the Rabbi [Rashi]. Rather, the Beraitha is stating that this whole [Scriptural passage laying down the law of] excision is redundant, and therefore we are to apply it to any other idol that was worshipped in that way. It is this which the Rabbis have stated in the Gemara:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">229</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 64 b.</i> “Why is excision mentioned thrice [as the punishment] for idolatry?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">230</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verses 3 and 5 here; Numbers 15:31.</i> It is prescribed once for [worshipping an idol in] the customary manner; once for worshipping it in a non-customary manner,” that is, if he sacrifices, or burns incense, or pours a libation, or bows down before an idol,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">231</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See “The Commandments,” Vol. II, pp. 4-6, that these four modes of worship are forbidden to be done before any idol, even if the idol is not ordinarily worshipped in that manner.</i> which have been included under the punishment of death<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">232</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 22:19: <i>He that sacrificeth unto the gods shall be utterly destroyed</i>. And see “The Commandments,” Vol. II, p. 6.</i> even if the idol is not ordinarily worshipped in that manner, and here [in the verse before us] they are made liable to excision [in the absence of witnesses]. “And once excision is mentioned for [the worship of] Molech” [for Molech is <i>not</i> an idol, but a form of witchcraft which the Torah prohibited by means of this strong form of punishment]. And according to the Sage who says that Molech <i>is</i> an idol [we must perforce say that the reason why the Torah singled out the Molech is in order to prohibit and punish] passing a child through the fire before any idol whatever, even if the idol is not ordinarily worshipped in that manner, as we have mentioned."

                    "AND IF A MAN ‘YIKACH’ (SHALL TAKE) HIS SISTER. Scripture mentions the term <i>kichah</i> [“taking,” which generally denotes the taking of a woman as a wife] in the case of a sister, although betrothal to her is not valid, because a brother and sister sleep together in one house, and when his desire overpowers him, he takes her and draws her to himself, and he does not have to come to her as one does to a woman who is a harlot. Similarly it is the way of Scripture to use the term “taking” in the case of all those with whom one remains alone, for a wife and her mother,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">244</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 14.</i> [a wife] and her son’s daughter and her daughter’s daughter,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">245</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 18:17.</i> a wife and her sister,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">259</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 18.</i> and a brother’s wife<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">260</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 21.</i> are all [found] with him in one house [hence Scripture uses the term “taking” in each of these cases]. For a similar reason Scripture uses this expression in the following verse, <i>A man shall not ‘take’ his father’s wife</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">261</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 23:1.</i> The expression <i>and he see her nakedness</i> is an euphemism, since Scripture modifies its expression in speaking of forbidden relationships. Sometimes it calls sexual intercourse “uncovering of nakedness,” as it says in the case of most of the forbidden women, <i>thou shalt not uncover her nakedness</i>, for it is the way of those who commit fornication to uncover her skirts, similar to that which is said, <i>and I will uncover thy skirts upon thy face;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">262</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nahum 3:5.</i> and at times it calls it “entering,” thus: <i>If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">263</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 22:13.</i> <i>to come in unto us;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">264</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 19:31.</i> <i>and he came in unto her, and she conceived by him</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">265</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 38:18.</i> Many times Scripture calls it “lying,” and here it refers to it as “seeing,” since brother and sister lodge together and there is no need for uncovering of skirts. Similarly Scripture uses the euphemism “knowing,” as in the following expressions: <i>And the man knew Eve his wife;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">266</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 4:1.</i> <i>and he knew her again no more;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">267</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 38:26.</i> <i>a virgin, neither had any man known her</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">268</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 24:16.</i> And Scripture states [here in the verse before us] <i>and she see his nakedness</i>, meaning to say that she too desired his nakedness in her heart and consented thereto. Now it mentions these expressions only in the case of a sister, because in all forbidden relations when a man approaches a woman for the purpose of uncovering her nakedness, it is generally with her consent, and otherwise she can remove herself from him and cry for help, but in the case of a brother [and sister] who lodge together, it may be that it was done without her knowledge, and therefore Scripture mentioned that she too “saw his nakedness.”",
                    "IT IS ‘CHESED.’ In the opinion of the commentators<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">269</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi and R’dak (in Sefer Hashorashim, root <i>chesed</i>).</i> <i>chesed</i> here means “shame,” because all people will naturally be ashamed of this ugly sin, this being used here as in the Aramaic language, for Onkelos translated, <i>for that were ‘a disgrace’ unto us</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">270</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 34:14.</i> “for that were <i>chisudo</i> unto us.” Yonathan ben Uziel also translated <i>and I will lay it for ‘a reproach,’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">271</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 11:2.</i> “[and I will lay it for] <i>chisudo</i>.” And in the language of the Sages [we find]:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">272</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ruth Rabbah 7:11.</i> “Because <i>shechasdo</i> (he shamed him) in public.” Similarly, <i>lest he that heareth it ‘y’chasedcha’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">273</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 25:10.</i> means “lest he cause you shame upon your revealing the secret of another.”<br><i>And they shall be cut off in the sight of the children of their people</i>. The intention thereof is as follows: “You have done this secretly, but G-d will reveal your sin by bringing upon you a punishment before all the children of your people.” He mentioned this with reference to a sin which is done in utmost secrecy, but it applies as well to all [sins punishable by] excision, as I have mentioned. <i>He hath uncovered his sister’s nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity</i>. This means that if he had uncovered his sister’s nakedness against her will, he alone shall bear his iniquity, as Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented. But in my opinion the expression <i>he hath uncovered his sister’s nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity</i> means that each one of those mentioned [will bear the iniquity], just like the expression <i>for he hath made naked his near kin; they shall bear their iniquity</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">274</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 19.</i><br>The correct interpretation of the word <i>chesed</i> [<i>it is ‘chesed’</i>] appears to me to be according to its plain sense [“goodness,” “kindness”]. So also is the opinion of our Rabbis.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">275</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Kedoshim</i> 11:9. “<i>It is ‘chesed.’</i> And if you should say: ‘But Cain did marry his sister!’ It is for this reason that Scripture states, <i>it is ‘chesed’</i> [<i>an act of kindness</i> — done by the Creator in order that the world be built up], for the world from its very start was created only by kindness, as it is said, <i>The world was built up through kindness</i>” (Psalms 89:3).</i> The verse is thus stating that the brother’s kinship is kindness,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">276</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., a brother’s kinship to his sister should express itself in kindness, as that is the essence of kinship, whereas he has acted to the contrary.</i> and it is not proper for the uncovering of nakedness. Thus in the case of other relations Scripture mentions that the reason [for the prohibition of sexual intercourse] is because they are next of kin, but in the case of a brother [and sister] it mentions as the reason the kindness which should be among them. The word <i>ish</i> [<i>and if ‘a man’ shall take his sister</i>] thus draws along with it a similar word [so that the expression <i>it is ‘chesed’</i> becomes “it is <i>ish chesed</i>,” meaning: “it is a man who should have acted kindly to her, but he did the contrary, and hence his punishment is severe”]. Or it may be that [the expression <i>it is ‘chesed’</i>] is like: <i>and I am prayer</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">277</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 109:4.</i> [which means: “and I am ‘a man of’ prayer”<i>; for thou art precious things</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">278</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Daniel 9:23.</i> [which means: “for thou art ‘a man of’ precious things”]<i>; Behold, I am against thee, O arrogance</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">279</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 50:31.</i> [which means: “‘man of’ arrogance”], in all of which cases the word <i>ish</i> (man) is missing [and here too that word is omitted, as if it were to say: “it is <i>ish chesed</i>,” as explained above]. Or it may be that Scripture in these cases refers to these men by their qualities [as if to say, “kindness personifies the brother,” “I am all prayer,” “he is all preciousness,” or “arrogance personified”. Thus Scripture is stating, <i>And if a man shall take his sister … and see her nakedness … he is</i> [to have been] <i>the man of kindness, and they shall be cut off</i>, for <i>he hath uncovered his sister’s nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity</i>. Thus He mentioned that the brother should have been <i>the merciful man who doeth good to his own soul</i>, but <i>he was cruel and troubled his own flesh</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">280</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 11:17.</i> For he should have done the kindness to her that brothers do, to give her in marriage to a husband, but he blemished and troubled her. Scripture ascribes the fault in such cases to the male, just as it is said, <i>he hath uncovered his brother’s</i> [wife’s] <i>nakedness; they shall be childless</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">281</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 21.</i> [and likewise here too it states, <i>‘he’ hath uncovered his sister’s nakedness</i>]. Similarly it is my opinion that the expression, <i>lest he that heareth it ‘y’chasedcha’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">273</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 25:10.</i> means “lest he that hears it will remove from you all kindness, because you have not shown kindness to your friend who entrusted you with his secret.” [The word <i>y’chasedcha</i> here meaning “remove <i>kindness</i>”] is like: <i>l’dashno</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">282</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 27:3.</i> [the root of which <i>deshen</i> in its primary sense means “to <i>cover with</i> ashes,” but also has the opposite meaning of “<i>removing</i> the ashes”]<i>; and all mine increase ‘t’shareish’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">283</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 31:12.</i> [which, in its ordinary form, would mean “to take root,” but also has the opposite meaning of “rooting out”], and similar cases. [Likewise, <i>y’chasedcha</i> which is of the root <i>chesed</i>, kindness, means in the verse quoted “remove kindness,” and does not mean “shame.”] For it appears to me unlikely that the word <i>chesed</i> in the Sacred Language should bear such opposite meanings [as “kindness” and “shame”], when Scriptural texts abound in the praise of <i>chesed</i> and use it in prayers. The term <i>chisudo</i>, however, in Aramaic is another matter. Even that language differentiates between the two usages; “kindness” is translated <i>chisdo</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">284</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 39:21: <i>and He showed him ‘chased’</i> Onkelos translates: “and He showed him [Joseph] <i>chisdo</i>” (mercy, kindness).</i> and “shame” is translated <i>chisudo</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">285</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As Onkelos translated in Genesis 34:14 [mentioned above].</i> Now Rabbeinu Chananel<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">286</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Exodus, Vol. II, p. 106, Note 45, on Rabbeinu Chananel. It is of interest here to add that in view of the fact that Ramban quotes an interpretation of Rabbeinu Chananel on a verse in the Book of Proverbs, it would seem to indicate that Rabbeinu Chananel’s exegetic activity extended also to the Scriptural books in the division of the Writings, in addition to those on the Pentateuch and the Prophets.

But in my opinion this too is an expression of contrast [as will be explained]. For “righteousness” and <i>chesed</i> are mentioned in that verse [thus: <i>Righteousness exalteth a nation, but ‘chesed’ to any people is sin</i>], these being twin terms mentioned in all places, as for example: <i>he that followeth after righteousness and ‘chesed;’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">288</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 21:21.</i> <i>that I am the Eternal who exercises ‘chesed,’ justice, and righteousness in the earth</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">289</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 9:23.</i> Rather, the meaning of the verse in my opinion is as follows: “<i>Righteousness</i> if practiced <i>exalteth a nation</i>, but <i>‘chesed’</i> (mercy, kindness) <i>is a reproach to any people</i> if it fails to practice it.” Thus the verse is stating that upon righteousness and mercy depends the elevation or the decline of any people. Or it may be [that the verse is] stating: “Righteousness exalts any individual nation that practices it, while many nations sin by their failure to do mercy.” A similar example of such a verse is the one immediately preceding it: <i>In the heart of him that hath discernment, wisdom resteth; but in the inward part of fools it maketh itself known</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">290</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 14:33.</i> the meaning of which is that “it makes itself known that [wisdom] is not there,” for all who see them recognize by their deeds that they are fools <i>and there is no understanding in them</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">291</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 32:28.</i> These two verses [thus express their thoughts in their second half] in a negative manner.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">292</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus: <i>Mercy is a reproach to any people</i> if it does not practice it. <i>In the inward part of fools it makes itself known</i> that wisdom does not rest therein.</i><br>Emor"

                    "SAY [UNTO THE PRIESTS] … AND THOU SHALT SAY UNTO THEM. “[The repetition of the verb <i>say … and thou shalt say</i> is] to warn the adults about the children” [that they observe this law]. This is Rashi’s language on the basis of the words of our Rabbis.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yebamoth 114 a.</i> Now the meaning of this “warning” is to state that we are not to assist with our hands in the defilement of children [but it does not intend to warn us that we are obliged to prevent them from becoming defiled]. There are many admonitions in the Torah of this nature according to the interpretation of our Rabbis,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yebamoth 114 a.</i> such being the prohibitions against eating blood and swarming things, and against the defilement [of priests], and from them we learn that [it is applicable to] all prohibitions of the Torah, that we must not assist children in any case to transgress the law. But if they are doing it of their own accord, we<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the court. But his father is obliged to rebuke him and prevent him from doing that which is forbidden (<i>ibid.</i>, and such is the final decision of the law, Shulchan Aruch, <i>Hilchoth Shabbath</i>, 343).</i> are not commanded to prevent them [from so doing since they have not yet reached the training period of minors for religious practices, but if they have reached that stage, everyone is commanded to prevent them from doing a prohibited act].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shulchan Aruch <i>ibid.</i>, Rama, and Mishnah Brurah, 7.</i> The meaning of the verse according to its interpretation is then: “<i>say unto the priests … and thou shalt say</i> it over again to them, that they are not to defile themselves,” the purpose of the many warnings being [to teach] that all sons of Aaron are to be guarded from defilement, even the young ones. And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra said by way of the plain meaning of Scripture, that <i>say unto the priests</i> refers to the section mentioned above [i.e., <i>Seder Kedoshim</i>], since they [the priests] are the teachers of the Torah and it is they who admonish the people; <i>and thou shalt say unto them</i>, meaning those specific commandments which devolve upon them alone to observe, [as mentioned in this section]. But it is not correct [to interpret two such adjacent phrases as referring to two different sections].<br>In my opinion the plain sense of the verse is as follows: The meaning of <i>emor</i> (say) is like that of <i>dabeir</i> (speak): <i>Give ear to ‘amarai,’</i> O Eternal<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 5:2.</i> is like <i>d’varai</i> (my words). A similar case is <i>‘imrei’</i>(<i>words of</i>) <i>truth</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 22:21. This is equivalent to <i>‘divrei’ emeth</i> (words of truth) — Ecclesiastes 12:10.</i> So also: <i>for it hath heard all ‘imrei’</i> (<i>the words of</i>) <i>the Eternal</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 24:27. Here too it is like <i>‘divrei’ Hashem</i> (the words of G-d) in Exodus 24:3.</i> And the expression <i>Go in unto Pharaoh ‘v’dibarta’</i> (<i>and thou shalt speak</i>) <i>to him</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 9:1.</i> is like <i>v’amarta</i> (and thou shalt say). <i>‘Vayedabeir Mosheh’</i> (<i>And Moses spoke</i>) <i>unto Aaron, and unto Elazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left: ‘Take the meal-offering</i>,’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 10:12.</i> is like <i>vayomer Mosheh</i> (<i>and Moses said</i>). And so also you find in many places that both [<i>amor</i> and <i>dabeir</i> are used in one verse, such as:] <i>‘Dabeir</i> (<i>Speak</i>) <i>unto the children of Israel, ‘v’amarta’</i> (<i>and say</i>) <i>unto them</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 15:38.</i> such usage [of the two verbs] being found in those sections where He wishes to warn them strongly [about a certain law] either because of the stringency of the matter, or on account of their habit to commit that sin. Thus <i>‘emor’</i> (<i>say</i>) <i>unto the priests … ‘v’amarta’</i> (<i>and thou shalt say</i>) <i>unto them</i> [is like <i>‘dabeir’</i> (<i>speak unto the priests</i>) <i>‘v’amarta’</i> (<i>and thou shalt say</i>), as will be explained further on]. Similarly, <i>Thus saith the Eternal, the G-d of Israel: Go ‘v’amarta’</i> (<i>and say</i>) <i>to Zedekiah king of Judah ‘v’amarta’</i> (<i>and say</i>) <i>unto him: Thus saith the Eternal</i> etc.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 34:2.</i> means “Go <i>dabeir</i> (speak) to Zedekiah.” Similarly, <i>‘Vatomer ha’ishah ha’t'ko’ith’</i> (<i>And when the woman of Tekoa said</i>) <i>to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and prostrated herself, ‘vatomer’</i> (<i>and she said</i>)<i>: ‘Help, O king’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Samuel 14:4.</i> is like: “<i>vatedabei’r ha’ishah</i> (<i>and the woman spoke</i>) to the king <i>vatomer</i> (<i>and she said</i>), ‘Help, O king.’” The meaning of <i>Say unto the priests … and thou shalt say unto them</i> is thus like “speak to the priests and say to them,” similar to [that which we find elsewhere], <i>‘Dabeir’</i> (<i>speak</i>) <i>unto the children of Israel, ‘v’amarta’</i> (<i>and say</i>) <i>unto them</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 15:38.</i> the meaning thereof being: “speak to the people in My Name, and say thus to them,” like, <i>Go in unto Pharaoh, and say unto him:</i> [<i>‘Thus saith the Eternal: Let My people go’</i>].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 7:26. — In brief, Ramban up to this point has explained that there is no difference between <i>emor</i> and <i>dabeir</i>, and that the double use of each of these verbs or the use of the two together is to indicate the importance of the subject discussed. I have found a similar view in Yonah ibn Ganach’s Sefer Hashorashim, root <i>dabeir</i>.</i> Now many scholars<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I have not identified these scholars.</i> say that the meaning of <i>‘dabeir’ unto the children of Israel</i> is like that of the term <i>kriah</i> (calling), thus: “call unto the children of Israel that they assemble themselves before you, and you shall say to them the following,” and similarly <i>‘emor’ to the priests</i> means [“call them] to assemble themselves and to listen.”<br>[SAY UNTO] THE PRIESTS. The reason for [His mentioning the term] <i>the priests</i> [in this section is as follows]: In commandments relating to matters of the offerings He says, <i>Command Aaron and his sons</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 6:2. Or: <i>Speak unto Aaron and his sons</i> (<i>ibid.</i>, Verse 18).</i> and does not refer to them by the name “the priests,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“The priests.” In the Tur quoting Ramban: “and He does not refer to them by the term of priesthood.”</i> because those subjects concern the offerings or the various degrees of holiness of the Sanctuary. But here He warns the priests that they should never defile themselves for the dead, even at a time when they do not come into the Sanctuary, this being a mark of distinction to them personally; therefore Scripture mentioned here <i>the priests</i>, meaning to say that it is because they are the priests of the Eternal and the ministers of our G-d that He told them to conduct themselves in a manner reflecting honor and greatness, and that they should never become defiled. Thus the priests who are unfit for the priesthood [i.e., those who are born from a marriage forbidden to their father], are excluded from this principle [i.e., they are permitted to defile themselves for the dead].<br>The explanation of <i>‘lo yitama’</i> (<i>he shall not defile himself</i> — in the singular) is that you [i.e., Moses] are to tell the priests that none of them is to defile himself for the dead among his people. Or it may be that [the use of the singular in <i>lo yitama</i>] is connected with the expression of <i>‘ba’al b’amav’</i> (<i>a chief man among his people</i>) mentioned below in Scripture,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 4.</i> and the meaning thereof [here] is: “the chief man among his people is not to defile himself [for the dead].” And the meaning of <i>ba’al b’amav</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 4.</i> is like the expressions: <i>‘miba’alei Yehudah;’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Samuel 6:2.</i> <i>‘ba’aleigoyim,’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 16:8.</i> namely “the dignitaries” or “the lords” among them [i.e., Judah<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Samuel 6:2.</i> and the nations<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 16:8.</i>], similar to the phrase: <i>‘ba’alav ein imo’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 22:13.</i> — “the master is not with it; “<i>‘ba’al habayith’</i> — “the master of the house;” as honored people are called “lords.” The verse here is thus stating: “the honored one among his people [i.e., the priest] is not to defile himself for the dead, [in which case] he would be treating his honor with irreverence.” Scripture is thus explaining that it is because of the distinction of the priest, seeing that he is fit to become the highest and most honored one among his people [i.e., the High Priest] that it warns him not to profane his distinction with the impurity of the dead. By means of this statement, Scripture intends to teach us that it should not occur to us to say that the warning [against the priests defiling themselves for the dead] is only when they come into the Tent of Meeting to perform the holy Service. Similarly in this whole section He states that all restrictions [on the priests mentioned here] are due to their distinction. Thus: <i>she profaneth her father;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 9.</i> <i>and he shall not profane his seed</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 15.</i> Onkelos likewise translated [Verse 4]: “The chief among his people shall not defile himself, to be profaned thereby.” But in the Torath Kohanim<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 1:15.</i> [<i>ba’al b’amav</i>]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 4.</i> is interpreted [literally] to refer to “a husband” with reference to his wife, as Rashi has written.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus: “A husband [a priest] shall not defile himself for his wife’s corpse while it is among his people, meaning where there are other persons who can attend to her burial, this applying only to a wife who disqualified him from serving as a priest, because she was forbidden to him in marriage.” But otherwise the priest is to defile himself for his wife, even if there are other people to attend to her burial.</i>"

From this you deduce that a common priest who officiated when he is an <i>onen</i>, does profane the Service.” This is Rashi’s language.<br>But these two interpretations [that Rashi mentioned, namely, that the High Priest is not to follow the bier of a near relative, and that he may officiate when he is an <i>onen</i>], are really opposing opinions, for since the verse <i>permitted</i> the High Priest not to leave the Sanctuary on account of his mourning, as a common priest must do, but instead he may [continue to] officiate when he is an <i>onen</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See above, <i>Seder Shemini</i>, Note 85.</i> then there is <i>no admonition here</i> against his following the bier of his near relative.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To understand Ramban’s criticism of Rashi’s interpretation, it is necessary to recall the difference between a statement which is a mere negation and one which is a prohibition. “An admonition is in the nature of a charge; it is in fact the verb in its command-form” (“The Commandments,” Vol. II, p. 391). But a statement of negation merely excludes a particular case from a certain subject (see further, Ramban Vol. II, p. 350, Note 71). Now the verse before us reads, <i>Neither shall he go out of the Sanctuary, nor profane the Sanctuary of his G-d</i>. In interpreting the phrase, <i>neither shall he go out of the Sanctuary</i> as a prohibition, meaning that <i>he is not permitted</i> to leave the Sanctuary to follow the bier, how could Rashi continue on the basis of <i>the same phrase</i> to state that <i>he need not</i> leave the Sanctuary, but he may perform the Service, since these two interpretations of the same phrase are contradictory to each other! This is the meaning of Ramban’s succinct objection: “Since the verse <i>permitted</i> the High Priest … then there is <i>no admonition</i> …” Mizrachi, in defense of Rashi, answers that Rashi was not referring only to the first phrase [as if both the permission and the admonition are derived from the same phrase], but rather to both phrases of the verse, the first one [<i>neither shall he go out</i> …] establishing the prohibition, and the second one [<i>nor profane</i> …] constituting the negation. Ramban will also further on defend Rashi’s position from another standpoint.</i> Similarly, <i>nor shall he profane the Sanctuary of his G-d</i> is, according to this interpretation [of Rashi], nothing but a statement that the Service of the High Priest does not become profaned [although performed when he is an <i>onen</i>], from which you are to deduce that a common priest who officiates when he is an <i>onen</i>, does defile the Service. But if so, this verse is merely a negation, not a prohibition, and yet the “masters of the <i>Halachoth</i>”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Masters of the <i>Halachoth</i>.” From the ensuing phrase [“counted it among the negative commandments in the Hilchoth Gedoloth”], it is obvious that Ramban is referring to one particular work. But if so, why does he speak of “the masters” [in the plural] of that work? It may be that this is because it has long been in doubt whether the authorship of that book is to be ascribed to Rav Yehudai Gaon or to Rabbi Shimon Kairo, or to both. Hence Ramban writes here “the masters of the <i>Halachoth</i>.” See, however, in Exodus 21:7, where Ramban writes of “the master of the Hilchoth Gedoloth” — in the singular. See Vol. II, p. 350, Note 70.</i> counted it among the negative commandments in the Hilchoth Gedoloth! Moreover, I have already quoted the Beraitha<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For the meaning of this term, see in Exodus, <i>Seder Bo</i>, Note 209.</i> which is taught in the Torath Kohanim<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Shemini Milu’im</i> 42. Ramban quoted it above, 10:6.</i> where it is clearly explained that this verse is a proper prohibition [and not a mere negation], as it is taught: “<i>And ye shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 8:33.</i> I might think that [upon becoming apprised of the death of a near relative, an ordinary priest may not leave the Sanctuary] whether he is ministering or not; Scripture therefore says, <i>Neither shall he go out of the Sanctuary, nor shall he profane</i>. When is he not permitted to go out [so that only by his staying there] he does not profane it? I must say that this applies only when he is ministering.” And it further states there [in the Torath Kohanim]:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Shemini Milu’im</i> 43.</i> “I would only know that this tells me that Aaron and his sons, who were anointed with the oil of anointment, are liable to death [by the hand of Heaven] if they leave the Sanctuary while they are ministering. How do I know that this [prohibition] applies also to all priests of all times? etc.” Thus it is clear that the verse before us constitutes an actual negative commandment, prohibiting the priest from leaving the Service and going out [of the Sanctuary].<br>Therefore I say in order to maintain the words of all the Sages [i.e., of Rashi and of the author of the Hilchoth Gedoloth, as will be explained], that the main purpose of this verse is to admonish the High Priest not to leave the Sanctuary while he is ministering, on [becoming apprised of] the death of any near relative, and he is not to profane the Sanctuary by leaving its Service for the honor of the dead. Instead, the honor of the Sanctuary and its Service is to be greater to him than his honor of and love for the dead, and it follows all the more so that if he left his ministration for no reason at all, and went out of the Sanctuary, that he has violated this negative commandment. However, Scripture warned him with [especial] reference to the dead, in order [incidentally] to permit the High Priest to perform the Service when he is an <i>onen</i> (a mourner),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See above, <i>Seder Shemini</i>, Note 85.</i> and since it is permissible for him to perform it, therefore if he leaves it voluntarily it constitutes a profanation of the Sanctuary. This is the meaning of this verse, and I have already written it in the section of <i>Vay’hi Bayom Ha’shemini</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above 10:6.</i><br>We find furthermore that our Rabbis have differed in the second chapter of Tractate Zebachim [on this matter, namely whether the verse before us is a prohibition, or a mere negation]. Thus they have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zebachim 16 a.</i> “How do we know that an <i>onen</i> [who performs] profanes the Service? Because it is written, <i>Neither shall he</i> [i.e., the High Priest] <i>go out of the Sanctuary, nor profane;</i> but any other priest who does not go out [of the Sanctuary], does profane it [i.e., if he officiates when he is an <i>onen</i>]. And Rabbi Ilai<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Rabbi Eleazar.</i> said, We derive it from this verse: <i>Behold, this day have they offered their sin-offering and their burnt-offering</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 10:19. The verse refers to the day when Aaron’s two sons — Nadab and Abihu — died, and Aaron the High Priest performed the Service on that day. When Moses was angry with Elazar and Ithamar, Aaron’s two remaining sons, for not eating a certain offering as required, but burning it instead, Aaron intervened by replying: “Did <i>they</i> perform the rites of the offerings? It was <i>I</i>, the High Priest, who ministered, and the High Priest may indeed minister whilst an <i>onen</i>. And as for the reason why that offering was burnt etc.” (see above, 10:19).</i> — it is ‘I’ [Aaron — the High Priest] who offered! From this you may learn that if they [Aaron’s sons — Elazar and Ithamar] had performed the rites of the offerings, they would have acted correctly [in burning them, since common priests who minister when in a state of <i>aninuth</i> (mourning) invalidate the Service] etc. And Rabbi Ilai, why does he not derive this principle from the verse, <i>Neither shall he go out of the Sanctuary, nor profane?</i> He will answer you: Is it after all written, ‘But any other priest who does not go out of the Sanctuary does profane it’?” The meaning of [Rabbi Ilai’s answer] is that since Scripture states an admonition with reference to the High Priest, that he is not to leave the Sanctuary and that he should not profane the Service by leaving it [on becoming apprised of the death of a near relative], there is no implication here that a common priest <i>does</i> profane the Service if he officiates when he is an <i>onen</i> [and hence Rabbi Ilai resorted to another verse — <i>Behold, this day</i> etc.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 10:19. The verse refers to the day when Aaron’s two sons — Nadab and Abihu — died, and Aaron the High Priest performed the Service on that day. When Moses was angry with Elazar and Ithamar, Aaron’s two remaining sons, for not eating a certain offering as required, but burning it instead, Aaron intervened by replying: “Did <i>they</i> perform the rites of the offerings? It was <i>I</i>, the High Priest, who ministered, and the High Priest may indeed minister whilst an <i>onen</i>. And as for the reason why that offering was burnt etc.” (see above, 10:19).</i> — from which he learned that a common priest who is an <i>onen</i> profanes the Service]. From this text, then, there is another proof that it is not [merely] a permission [that the Torah extended] to the High Priest, permitting him to perform the Service, and informing him that his ministration will not become profaned [as Rashi had stated it], for if that were the case, it <i>would</i> surely have followed that a common priest does profane it by ministering [when he is an <i>onen</i>]. Thus it appears from the interpretation of the text,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The significance of this phrase of Ramban (“the interpretation of the text”), becomes clearer later on in the text, as another interpretation is offered by the author. At this point here Ramban is saying that the plain interpretation of the Beraitha shows that the First Sage agrees with Rashi’s view that the verse before us is a mere negation, and not an admonition to the High Priest (see following note).</i> that according to the opinion of the first answer [stated above, that we know that an <i>onen</i> profanes the Service from the verse about the High Priest, <i>Neither shall he go out</i> etc., which teaches by implication: “but any other priest who does not go out, does profane it”], it constitutes a mere negation as far as the High Priest is concerned,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban’s meaning is as follows: Since the First Sage of this Beraitha derives the <i>admonition</i> against a <i>common</i> priest ministering whilst in mourning from the verse about the High Priest [as explained in the text], this perforce shows that this Sage holds that with reference to the High Priest, the verse is a mere negation, and the reasoning is as follows: “Since Scripture states that the High Priest <i>need not</i> leave his ministration, we understand by implication that the common priest <i>must</i> leave it.” Thus with reference to the High Priest the verse is a mere negation, but, by implication, it is an admonition to the common priest. Rashi’s interpretation quoted at the beginning of this verse, that the verse is a negation, is thus justified and is in accord with the opinion of this Beraitha. — Thus far Ramban argued on the basis of the <i>interpretation</i> of the text of the Beraitha, that it substantiates <i>Rashi’s</i> position. Ramban will now turn his attention to the fact that a cursory reading of the Beraitha does convey the thought that the verse is <i>an admonition</i> to the High Priest, which is the opinion of the Hilchoth Gedoloth [as mentioned above], and he will explain the Beraitha accordingly. Thus Ramban has “validated the words of <i>all</i> the Sages” — Rashi and Hilchoth Gedoloth as he promised above in the text.</i> [to teach us] that he does not profane his Service [and invalidate it if he officiates whilst he is an <i>onen</i>], as is the language of Rashi. However, because in the Beraitha [quoted above] it is clearly stated that it is an admonition [an opinion held by the Hilchoth Gedoloth], we shall say that they<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“They.” The reference may be to “the masters of the <i>Halachoth</i>” (see Note 30 above).</i> hold that since the admonition pertains only to the High Priest, and by implication we reason that a common priest does go out [of the Sanctuary] and leave the ministration, from this we learn that [if the common priest would continue ministering], the Service would be profaned, for if it would have been valid, [the Torah] would not have permitted him to leave it. And so it is taught in the Torath Kohanim in this section:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 2:6.</i> “How do we know that if [the High Priest] officiates [whilst he is an <i>onen</i>] that his Service is valid? Because Scripture says, <i>Nor shall he profane</i>. But if a common priest officiates whilst in mourning, his Service <i>is</i> invalid.”<br>Now as to the text written in Tractate Sanhedrin:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 18 a. — Ramban now quotes a text showing that the verse <i>‘Neither shall he go out of the Sanctuary,’ prohibits</i> the High Priest from following the bier of his near relative, so that he should not become defiled thereby and thus “go out from his sanctity” (see Note 44 further). From this text it would then appear that the verse is <i>not</i> an admonition against his going out of the Sanctuary because of the honor of the <i>Service</i>, but because of the honor of his own sanctity, which would thus be a contradiction to what was said above. This, in short, is the intention of Ramban in quoting this text, and further on he will remove the difficulty.</i> “<i>Neither shall he go out ‘min hamikdash’</i> (<i>of the Sanctuary</i>) — this means that he may not follow after the bier with the bearers, but [he may go forth with them as long as they do not see one another, thus:] when they [who form the funeral cortege] are hidden [from his view, as when entering an alley], he [the High Priest] appears; when they emerge, he disappears [in the alley]. These are the words of Rabbi Meir. But Rabbi Yehudah says: He may not go forth from the Sanctuary at all, for it is said, <i>Neither shall he go out of the Sanctuary</i>.” And [in the Gemara there] the Rabbis explained that the reason of Rabbi Meir is that he interprets the verse as follows: “<i>‘u’min hamikdash</i> — out of his sanctity — he shall not go forth,’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is to say, he is to guard himself against being defiled by the dead. This implies that he <i>is</i> to follow the bier, but must guard himself against touching it or its bearers, and hence he must never be in sight of the funeral cortege.</i> and as long as he has some distinction [to remind him not to defile himself, namely, the fact that he is not in sight of the funeral cortege], he will not come to touch the dead. And Rabbi Yehudah [is of the opinion that] on account of his grief, he might by chance touch it.” [Now this whole text would seem to indicate that the verse before us is an admonition whose purpose is to guard the sanctity of the High Priest, and not, as we have said above, that its purpose is to guard the sanctity of the Service!] However, all this is merely a Scriptural support for a Rabbinic ordinance. It is they [i.e., the Rabbis] who [decided to] guard the dignity of the High Priest, that he should not go out after the bier, because he is not permitted to defile himself for near relatives; and since people are upset about their dead, [they feared] lest he will touch it, similar to that which is written, <i>And Joseph fell upon his father’s face</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 50:1.</i> But a common priest must defile himself for his near relatives, and he is not so upset about other people that there is a fear lest he defile himself; [therefore there was no need for the Rabbis to institute a restriction against a common priest following the funeral cortege of people other than his near relatives]. Thus it is clear that all this is a mark of distinction [for the High Priest] by law of the Rabbis, and they gave it support by reference to this verse, as is the manner of <i>asmachtoth</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See in Exodus, p. 314, Note 449.</i> in the Talmud.

This means that he is not to wed a woman who is not a virgin, this being a negative commandment which is derived from a positive commandment [which carries the force of a positive commandment].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The intention of Ramban’s comment is that this verse is primarily intended to teach that the High Priest is <i>not</i> to marry a woman who is not a virgin. And the reason why it is stated in a positive form, is to make the negative aspect of it carry the force of a positive commandment, because it is an accepted principle that a negative commandment which is derived from a positive commandment carries only the force of a positive commandment. Therefore if he marries a woman who is not a virgin, he does not incur whipping, since the prohibition thereof is derived from a positive commandment, and only carries the force of a positive commandment, for the violation of which the court is not empowered to mete out punishment. This interpretation is made necessary by the following Verse 14, where it is stated again, <i>but a virgin of his own people shall he take to wife</i>. As Ramban will explain further on, it is this expression in Verse 14 which established the <i>positive</i> aspect thereof, while Verse 13 before us expresses the prohibitive part thereof. Thus the two verses are not redundant, but instead complement each other.</i> Afterwards [in the following verse] He forbids the High Priest by means of a negative commandment to marry a widow or other disqualified woman, and then says, <i>but a virgin of his own people shall he take to wife</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 14.

They have also explained there the reason why, for [mere] betrothal without [subsequent] intercourse, he is not liable to whipping, because [Scripture says: <i>he shall not take … he shall not profane</i>, meaning:] Why must he not take [her as his wife]? “In order that he may not profane” [his offspring, and therefore if the marriage was not consummated, and he can have no offspring from her, he is not liable merely for the betrothal].

In other words, since the word “they” in phrase 3 means “the children of Israel” mentioned in phrase 1, and the word “they” in phrase 2 definitely means “the priests,” why did Scripture place phrase 2 between phrases 1 and 3, which both refer to the children of Israel?

Hence the last sentence in Rashi contradicts his previous explanation!</i> Rather, [according to this final interpretation mentioned by Rashi, the whole verse can be explained in the order it is written without transposing the phrases, in the following way:] Scripture is stating: “<i>that they</i> [the priests] <i>separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they</i> [the priests] <i>profane not</i> by means of them [i.e., the holy things] <i>My holy Name</i> [through eating them in a state of impurity], and that <i>which they</i> [the priests themselves] <i>hallow unto Me</i>” [they should also not profane], meaning that they [the priests] should not profane the holy things which Aaron and his sons themselves hallow unto Me [and thus there is no need for transposing the verse.]!

And the reason [why He singled out <i>n’veilah</i> and <i>treifah</i> in warning the priests not to eat them, and He did not mention those creeping things which also render the eater impure], is because a man’s soul finds it loathsome to eat creeping things, but it does not find <i>n’veilah</i> and <i>treifah</i> loathsome. Therefore He mentioned here [the prohibition against eating food which conveys] impurity in the case of [that food] which it is common [to eat]. Now the word <i>treifah</i> mentioned here [which renders the eater impure, must perforce] mean an animal that was torn by a lion or bear which killed it in the field, for when it is still alive [and is then slaughtered ritually] it does not convey impurity [although it may not be eaten. The term <i>treifah</i> which the Torah mentions here as conveying impurity to one who eats it, is applicable, however, even to an animal that was not killed when torn by beasts], for from the moment when it is torn by the lion [or any beast] it is called <i>treifah</i> (“torn”), whether it is alive or after its death.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">95</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Therefore even after the animal torn by beasts has died, when strictly speaking it may be referred to as <i>n’veilah</i> since it was not ritually slaughtered, the Torah still calls it here <i>treifah</i>, for from the moment when it is torn by the beast it is called <i>treifah</i>, whether it is alive or after its death.</i> Thus He mentioned here all sources of impurity, for having stated that animals of the forbidden species [which are not mentioned here, although they do convey impurity to one who eats them], cannot be [made permissible by] ritual slaughtering,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">An animal that may <i>not</i> be eaten, even if ritually slaughtered, conveys impurity to the one who eats of it [in addition of course to having violated the prohibition against eating it], because there is no law of ritual slaughter regarding it, and it is therefore included under the term <i>n’veilah</i>. An animal of the permitted species, which, when ritually slaughtered, is found to have an organic disease which renders it forbidden for eating, does not convey impurity to the person who eats it, although he has transgressed the law which prohibits the eating of <i>treifah</i>.</i> as I have explained in the section of <i>‘Vay’hi Bayom Ha’shemini’</i> (<i>And it came to pass on the eighth day</i>),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">97</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 9:1. — <i>Ibid.</i>, 11:24.</i> it is [automatically] included under the term of <i>n’veilah</i> [which is mentioned here]. This is by way of the plain meaning of Scripture. The [Rabbinical] explanation<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">98</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chullin 100 b, and mentioned here in Rashi.</i> likewise interprets [this verse as an admonition] about holy things with reference to impurity, namely that the verse speaks of the carrion of a bird of a permissible species<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">99</sup><i class=\"footnote\">But a bird of a forbidden species has no defiling effect if eaten unintentionally (Mishneh Torah, <i>Hilchoth Aboth Hatumoth</i> 3:14). If there is, however, an intention to eat it, and it has been rendered susceptible to impurity [by having come into contact with liquid], it is like any other food and may itself contract a first grade impurity, but only if it itself comes into contact with an object that conveys impurity. It is not, however, capable of rendering the eater impure, as <i>human beings</i> cannot become impure through contact with <i>food</i>. The case of the carrion of a bird of a permitted species is a special exception, because in that case the Torah declared that it conveys impurity automatically <i>if eaten</i> [but not if merely touched], although it itself has not received impurity from another object. In short, it is, if eaten, a primary source of impurity which renders the eater impure.</i> [i.e., which died by itself, or has not been slaughtered properly], which has no defiling effect by means of contact or carrying, but [conveys] impurity only when in the [eater’s] gullet, and thus it forbids him to eat [subsequently] of the holy things. And we must then explain [that when Scripture states here] <i>‘u’treifah’</i> (<i>or is torn of beasts</i>),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">100</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, since as explained, the verse before us has reference only to the <i>carrion</i> of a permitted species of bird, which is <i>n’veilah</i>, why then did Scripture here mention <i>treifah</i> altogether? The answer is: it was necessary for Scripture to state here also <i>u’treifah</i> etc.</i> [it is in order to define the term <i>n’veilah</i>, and to explain that this law of impurity of <i>n’veilah</i> refers only] to those <i>kinds</i> [of birds] that can have a <i>treifah</i> [i.e., to those species which may usually be eaten if slaughtered properly, but which are nonetheless <i>treifah</i> if found to be suffering from certain organic diseases, and consequently forbidden to be eaten], thus excluding the carrion of a bird of one of the <i>forbidden</i> species, for in its class no <i>treifah</i> is ever possible [for such a bird, even if ritually slaughtered, is still <i>n’veilah</i>, since the law of <i>treifah</i> only applies to such birds which, if they were healthy, would be permitted as food by means of ritual slaughter, which does not apply to these forbidden species], as is stated in the language of Rashi [here]. And as far as the impurity of other <i>n’veiloth</i> is concerned, [so that the priest must be careful not to be defiled by them as this will make it necessary for him to be separated from the holy things, although they are not expressly mentioned in Scripture], they have been included in the Torath Kohanim on the basis of the following interpretation:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">101</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 4:4.</i> “<i>Or whosoever toucheth ‘b’chol’</i> (<i>any</i>) <i>swarming thing</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">102</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 5.</i> I would only know the swarming thing.

Thus the explanation of the verse is as follows: “A man that eats the holy thing [i.e., the heave-offering which belongs to the priest], must add the fifth of that holy thing to it, <i>and give to the priest</i> this <i>holy thing</i> which is its original value and the added fifth.” And since Scripture called it [the restitution] <i>kodesh</i> (holy thing), we deduce that it becomes as the original heave-offering [which he ate in error, and that it must therefore be] something which is capable of so becoming [namely fruits, but not money]. This is the correct explanation according to both the plain meaning of Scripture and the [Rabbinical] interpretation thereof. So also did Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra comment: “<i>And he shall give unto the priests ‘eth’ the holy thing</i>, means ‘with’ the holy thing [i.e., he is to give the priest its original value with the added fifth, all in fruits]. Or it may that the word <i>v’nathan</i> (and he shall give) draws along with it a similar word, and the sense of the verse is thus: ‘then he shall add its fifth part to it and shall give unto the priest, and he shall give unto the priest the holy thing.’ But in my opinion [so continues Ibn Ezra], there is no need [for both interpretations] because of the word <i>alav</i> (to it).”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">104</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, since Scripture states, <i>then he shall add its fifth part ‘to it</i>,’ it implies already that it is in addition to the original value of the heave-offering he ate which he must return to the priest. There is therefore no need any longer to interpret <i>and he shall give unto the priest ‘eth’ the holy thing</i> as meaning “with” the holy thing, since this has already been mentioned above in the preceding verse, and instead we interpret the word <i>eth</i> in its normal way, namely, the mark of the accusative case. By the same token of reasoning, the second interpretation mentioned in the text [that the word <i>v’nathan</i> draws along with it a similar word] also becomes unnecessary, since the word <i>alav</i> (to it) clearly indicates that he is to give both the original value and the added fifth to the priest.</i>"

AND SO CAUSE ‘OTHAM’ (THEM) TO BEAR THE INIQUITY THAT BRINGETH GUILT. “[The word <i>otham</i> here means] ‘themselves,’ meaning that they [the priests) cause themselves to bear iniquity when they [the non-priests] eat the holy things which have been set aside as the heave-offering, and have become sanctified as such, and forbidden to them [the non-priests]. And Onkelos who rendered the verse: ‘when they [the priests] eat them in impurity’ has translated it so unnecessarily.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">105</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For since the preceding verse [14] speaks of a non-priest eating the heave-offering, it is logical to interpret Verse 16 before us as being an admonition to the priests against giving the heave-offering to be eaten by non-priests [as Rashi first interpreted the verse]. According to Onkelos’ interpretation, however, that it is an admonition to the priests that they themselves should not eat it when in a state of impurity, then it properly belongs in the section above. For this reason Rashi rejected Onkelos’ interpretation as “unnecessary,” meaning to say, that while it is of course true that the priests are not permitted to do so, it is unnecessary to derive this prohibition from our verse, as it may be derived by logical deduction from Verse 6 above, which states concerning a priest who has become defiled, <i>he shall not eat of the holy things</i> (Verse 4; Makkoth 14 b).</i> Thus far is the language of Rashi, of blessed memory.<br>But I did not understand Rashi’s opinion. For it would appear from his words that this negative commandment constitutes a prohibition to the priests, that they are not to give the heave-offering to non-priests to eat of it. And if so, it would be fitting to explain [the word <i>‘otham’</i> in the phrase] <i>and so cause ‘otham’</i> (<i>them</i>), as a pronoun for “Israel,” meaning that the priests will thereby burden the Israelites with <i>the iniquity that beareth guilt</i>, when they [the Israelites] eat the holy things! Why then did Rabbi Yishmael find it necessary to interpret the word <i>otham</i> [as a reflexive form], meaning “themselves” [as Rashi mentioned]? Besides, this negative commandment is not mentioned [specifically] in the Talmud, but instead the priest is forbidden to do so as is the case with all other prohibitions [where we are forbidden to help or cause another person to commit a transgression].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">106</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See “The Commandments,” Vol. II, pp. 277-278.</i> Rather, the explanation of the phrase <i>the children of Israel</i> [in Verse 15] is that it refers back to the beginning [part of that verse, thus making it as follows]: “<i>and</i> the children of Israel <i>shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel which they set apart unto the Eternal</i>,” the verse thus constituting a second admonition<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">107</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The first admonition is in Verse 10 here: <i>There shall no common man eat of the holy thing</i>.</i> to the non-priest that he is not to eat of the holy things, [and the reason why it is repeated is] because He wanted to mention the punishment for the transgression thereof, stating <i>and they will cause themselves to bear the iniquity</i> etc. <i>when they</i> [the non-priests] <i>will eat their holy things</i>.<br>Now our Rabbis explained [that the reason for] the repetition of this admonition was to forbid the eating of <i>tevel</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">108</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tevel</i> is produce from which the heave-offering and the tithes have not been separated.</i> Thus they have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">109</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 83 a.</i> “Whence do we know that one who eats <i>tevel</i> is liable to death [by the hand of Heaven]? From the verse, <i>And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel which ‘yarimu’</i> (<i>they shall set apart</i>) <i>unto the Eternal</i>. Now the verse refers to that which is <i>yet</i> to be offered [namely, the verse refers to the holy things — the heave-offering and the tithes — which are not yet set apart from the produce, so that it is all <i>tevel</i>];<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">108</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tevel</i> is produce from which the heave-offering and the tithes have not been separated.</i> and then an identity of law is learned from the use of ‘profanation’ here and in the case of the heave-offering:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">110</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Reference is to Numbers 18:32: <i>Ye shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, that ye die not</i>. See “The Commandments,” Vol. II pp. 143-145, where this whole subject is discussed at length.</i> [just as there the penalty is death by the hand of Heaven, so here too].”<br>However, in the Torath Kohanim I have found this text:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">111</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 6:8-10.</i> “<i>And they shall not profane</i>. This includes one who anoints himself with or drinks [oil of heave-offering].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">112</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Tractate Niddah 32a this is explained as follows: “This includes a case where a non-priest anoints himself with the oil of heave-offering, so that he is as liable as if he had drunk it; but for drinking itself we need no verse to include it in the prohibition, since drinking is always included under the term of ‘eating.’”</i> <i>The holy things of the children of Israel</i>. For the things [declared] holy by the children of Israel, [a non-priest who eats of them by mistake] is liable to pay the priest their value and the added fifth [in fruits], but for the things [declared] holy by non-Jews, he [a non-priest] is not liable to repay [the priest] their value and the added fifth.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">113</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In our Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 6:8-10, the reading is as follows: “For the holy things of the children of Israel, [a non-priest who eats of them by mistake] is liable to add a fifth [to the original value], but for the holy things of non-Jews, he is not obliged to pay the added fifth.” The original value he must of course repay, since they were not his.</i> I might think that he is liable [to pay a fifth] for the heave-offering that is in the <i>tevel</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">108</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tevel</i> is produce from which the heave-offering and the tithes have not been separated.</i> [as will be explained further on]; Scripture therefore states, <i>that which ‘yarimu’</i> (<i>they will set apart</i>) <i>unto the Eternal</i>. For that which has been set apart they are liable to pay [an added fifth], but they are not liable to pay [an added fifth] for the heave-offering in the <i>tevel</i> [which has not yet been set apart]. <i>And so they will cause them to bear the iniquity that bringeth guilt</i>. This teaches us that for eating <i>tevel</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">108</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tevel</i> is produce from which the heave-offering and the tithes have not been separated.</i> one is also punishable by death [by the hand of Heaven].” Now this [Beraitha of the Torath Kohanim] is not in accord with the way of the Gemara [mentioned above].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">114</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The discrepancies between the Gemara and the Torath Kohanim are as follows: (a) The Gemara interprets the verse, <i>And they shall not profane</i> etc. as referring to that which is yet to be offered [as explained above in the text], and the Torath Kohanim explained it to include anointing oneself with or drinking oil of heave-offering. (b) In the Gemara the Rabbis derived from the Scriptural use of the word <i>yarimu</i> (they shall set apart) in the future, that this establishes the prohibition against eating <i>tevel</i> [as explained in the text], while the Torath Kohanim interpreted it to teach that for the heave-offering in the <i>tevel</i> he does not pay a fifth, if he ate it in error.</i> But I say that the inclusion of anointing and drinking [in the prohibition of our verse] is only a Scriptural support for a Rabbinic ordinance, since drinking is included in the term eating [and just as a non-priest is Scripturally forbidden to eat the heave-offering, so too he is Scripturally forbidden to drink it, without the necessity for a special inclusionary phrase], whilst anointing oneself with it is [only] prohibited by Rabbinic ordinance. It is so clearly explained in the Yerushalmi.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">115</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yerushalmi, Maaser Sheini II, 1.</i> And since He stated with reference to <i>tevel</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">108</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tevel</i> is produce from which the heave-offering and the tithes have not been separated.</i> <i>And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel</i>, because they are going to set aside a part thereof for the Eternal [as the future tense in the word <i>yarimu</i> — “they <i>will</i> set apart” — indicates], the Rabbis deduced from this that [only] the portion which is set apart [as the heave-offering] is called “holy”, and not the <i>tevel</i>. And if so, [eating <i>tevel</i>] is <i>not</i> included in the terms of the law, <i>And if a man eat of ‘the holy’ thing through error, then he shall add its fifth to it</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">116</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 14.</i> so that he be liable to pay the additional fifth.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">117</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One might have thought that since <i>tevel</i> contains the heave-offering which will be set apart for the priest, a non-priest who eats it by mistake should therefore make restitution to the priest by giving him its value and an added fifth, just as if he had eaten separately heave-offering which has already been removed from the produce. To preclude us from such reasoning, Scripture states here that he does not have to pay the additional fifth. However, the Divine punishment for eating <i>tevel</i> is the same as for eating the heave-offering, as Ramban continues.</i> It is for this reason that He teaches again, <i>and so cause them to bear the iniquity that bringeth guilt</i>, thereby teaching that eating <i>tevel</i> is also punishable by death [by the hand of Heaven], for it is the heave-offering in the <i>tevel</i> that is mentioned here. In brief, this verse speak of <i>tevel</i> and warns with reference to that which is yet to be offered in the future, according to the interpretation of our Rabbis."

And the reason for [this expression] is that there is nothing in connection with gifts for Temple repair which is obligatory, for [they are all brought only as a consequence of] willingness of the soul, and the custom of those who give a donation for Temple repair is that they bring it with [the language used in offering a] freewill-offering, “‘This is’ for the building.” Therefore wherever Scripture mentions <i>nedavah</i> without any qualification, it is for Temple repair, unless [the donor] expressly says that it is <i>for a burnt-offering</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">133</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above Verse 18.</i> or <i>an offering of peace-offerings</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">121</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 21.</i> as mentioned above. But the term <i>neder</i> (vow) without any qualification is said with reference to the holy things of the altar: <i>I will offer to Thee the offering of thanksgiving … I will pay ‘nedarai’</i> (<i>my vows</i>) <i>unto the Eternal, yea in the presence of all His people, in the courts of the Eternal’s House;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">140</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 116:17-19.</i> <i>I will come into Thy House with burnt-offerings, I will perform unto Thee ‘nedarai’</i> (<i>my vows</i>);<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">141</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 66:13.</i> <i>‘Nedarecha’</i> (<i>Thy vows</i>) <i>are upon me, O G-d; I will render thanks-offerings unto Thee</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">142</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 56:13.</i> And those who give for the altar bring [their animals] with [the language used in offering a vow-offering], saying, “If G-d will prosper me, I will come before Him with a burnt-offering.” It is for this reason that Scripture says here, <i>Any of the herd or flock that hath a limb too large or too small, that mayest thou make ‘nedavah’</i> (<i>a freewill gift</i>) [for Temple repair], for whatever his heart offers freewillingly, <i>but for a ‘neder’</i> (<i>a vow</i>) for G-d [i.e., for His altar] <i>it shall not be accepted</i>, just as He said, <i>that ye shall not bring, for it shall not be acceptable for you</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">143</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 20.</i> For Scripture did not say here, “<i>nedavah ‘takriv’ otho</i> (thou mayest ‘offer’ it as a freewill-offering),” which would have been similar to the expression [of <i>thakrivu</i> — “they shall offer” on the altar] used in this whole section,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">144</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Verses 18, 20, 22, 24, 25, where the expressions <i>yakriv, yakrivu, thakrivu</i>, are used. Now these words signify the bringing of an offering. But not so <i>ta’aseh</i> (thou shalt “make”), as Ramban continues to explain. Hence since it states here: “a freewill-offering <i>ta’aseh otho</i>,” the reference is not to making it an offering, but that we may make a gift of a blemished animal to the Temple treasury for necessary repairs. Rashi’s interpretation [“<i>that mayest thou make for a freewill-offering</i> — for keeping the Temple in repair”], is thus well-founded in the language of the verse.</i> but instead it says <i>‘ta’aseh otho’</i> (<i>thou mayest ‘make’ it</i>) — meaning to say, you may make of it <i>whatever thy hand attaineth to do by thy strength</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">145</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ecclesiastes 9:10.</i> — <i>but for a vow-offering it shall not be accepted</i>. Now [the reason] the Sages were forced to say this [interpretation, i.e., that <i>nedavah ta’aseh otho</i> here means that you may give the blemished animal as a gift to the Temple treasury, but may not bring it as an offering] is because it is in no way whatsoever possible to say that [an animal suffering from] any blemishes [mentioned in the <i>preceding</i> verses], namely, scabbed and scurvy,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">146</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 22.</i> or even one whose testicles are bruised or crushed,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">147</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 24.</i> be forbidden for any kind of offering, whether as a vow-offering or a freewill-offering, and then an animal which has any limb too long or too short [as mentioned in the verse before us] be forbidden for use only for some offerings, [i.e., vow-offerings] and permissible for others [i.e., freewill-offerings]! Such a distinction [between the kinds of offering] is not found in the Torah with reference to blemishes or impurity in those who perform the rites of the offerings [i.e., the priests]!<br>It is possible that He said that <i>any of the herd or flock that hath a limb too large or too small</i>, one may make into a freewill-offering [for the Temple repairs] by saying, “This shall be [<i>nedavah</i> — a gift];” but if he had vowed [for the Temple repairs by saying] “I pledge myself [to donate] of the herd or flock,” then if he brings a blemished animal it will not be acceptable for him, and he is not freed of his vow. We may thus say in accordance with the way [of interpretation] of our Rabbis that both [<i>nedavah</i> and <i>neder</i> mentioned in the verse before us] refer to gifts for the Temple repairs, since the expression <i>‘ta’aseh otho’</i> (<i>thou mayest ‘make’ it</i>) is unlike <i>takriv otho</i> [“thou mayest ‘offer’ it” on the altar]. This is without doubt the truth.<br>Now Scripture mentioned the permissibility of making a gift for the Temple repairs in the case of an animal that has a limb too long or too short, which are congenital blemishes in the formation of the animal, and it follows all the more so that an animal having small blemishes by [later] occurrence, such as <i>avereth</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">146</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 22.</i> which is blindness [caused] by the dimming of the eye, or a broken animal,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">146</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 22.</i> and needless to say [an animal that is] scabbed or [suffering from] scurvy,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">146</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 22.</i> [may be given as gifts for the Temple repairs]. It is possible that the verse [before us] is connected [with the preceding verse, thus]: “<i>Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wart, or scabbed, or scurvy</i> … and all <i>herd or flock that hath any thing too long or too short, thou mayest make a freewill gift</i> of any of these, <i>but for a vow-offering</i> [for the altar] <i>none</i> of these <i>will be acceptable</i>”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">147</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 24.</i> for him, meaning that even if they had been taken up to the altar, they must be brought down.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">148</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ramban above, 6:2.</i> And in the Torath Kohanim [it is written]:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">149</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 7:5.</i> “Whence do we know to include all disqualifications in the herd or flock?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">150</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Such as an animal that is too young for an offering (so explained by Malbim <i>ibid.</i>).</i> From the verse, <i>any of the herd or flock</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">151</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Why is this expression [<i>any of the herd or flock</i>] mentioned here at all, when it would have sufficed to state “and one that has a limb too large etc.”? The Torath Kohanim answers that it forms a sort of “similar expression” with Verse 28 further on, stating: <i>And whether it be one of the herd or flock, ye shall not slaughter it and its young both in one day</i>, this being a case of “lacking time,” and the verse before us thus establishes the principle that <i>anything</i> disqualified for offering in the herd or flock, must not be brought as an offering.</i> <i>that hath a limb too large or too small</i>, which includes all disqualifications of the herd or flock.” Our Rabbis have further included [a principle] within the expression <i>that mayest thou make for a freewill gift</i>, meaning that he may make [a blemished animal] as a gift for whatever [purpose in the Temple that] he pleases, but not unblemished animals, so that one who dedicates unblemished animals [which are fit for the altar] for Temple repairs, transgresses a positive commandment.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">152</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“For since it states, <i>that mayest thou make for a freewill gift</i> [for Temple repairs], it teaches that only a blemished animal we may so dedicate, but not an unblemished animal, and a negative commandment derived from a positive commandment carries the force of the positive commandment” (Temurah 7b).</i>"

So also the he-lamb of the sheaf came on account of the meal-offering of the <i>omer</i> (Verse 12) which was binding only in the Land of Israel.</i> concerning which He said, <i>When ye are come into the Land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">175</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 10.</i> but the observance of the days themselves [as festivals] was binding immediately.<br>He mentioned the Sabbath<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">176</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 3.</i> among <i>the appointed seasons which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">177</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Verse 2 before us.</i> [although the Sabbath is not proclaimed by the children of Israel, since its sanctity has been affirmed by G-d and is fixed throughout the generations], because it is also “an appointed day” [invariably fixed by G-d as the holy day] and we may thus refer to it as “a holy convocation.” Afterwards, He separated the rest of the festivals from the Sabbath, saying of them <i>which ye shall proclaim in their appointed season</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">178</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 4.</i> meaning on whatever day of the week they happen to fall, but the Sabbath is fixed and occurs [always] on the same day, hence it is not necessary that we proclaim it in its season.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">179</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hence in Verse 2 before us which includes the Sabbath among “the appointed seasons,” it says only <i>which shall ye proclaim to be holy convocations</i>, but does not add the expression “in their season,” for this means on whatever day they may happen to fall, whereas the Sabbath is always on a fixed day of the week.</i> And in the opinion of our Rabbis,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">180</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 9:5.</i> <i>which ye shall proclaim in their appointed season</i> alludes to the intercalations [of an extra month in a leap year] so that you proclaim them as festivals.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">181</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is to say, if for any reason the Great Court decided that the year be intercalated with an extra month, it admits of no doubt, and <i>the appointed seasons of the Eternal</i> are shifted accordingly.</i><br>The correct interpretation appears to me to be that the meaning of the verse <i>The appointed seasons of the Eternal, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are My appointed seasons</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">177</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Verse 2 before us.</i> is that it refers [only] to the festivals mentioned further on in the sections: <i>In the first month</i> etc.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">182</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 5.</i> [but it does not refer to the Sabbath]. It is for this reason that He states there once again, <i>These are the appointed seasons of the Eternal</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">178</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 4.</i> because He had interrupted with the subject of the Sabbath. Thus He states, <i>The appointed seasons of the Eternal, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are My appointed seasons</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">177</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Verse 2 before us.</i> meaning that no manner of <i>servile</i> work [be done on them], but the Sabbath you are to keep, making it a <i>Sabbath of solemn rest</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">176</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 3.</i> from <i>all</i> manner of work<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">183</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ramban further in Verse 7 for the difference between “no manner of <i>‘m’lecheth avodah</i>’ (servile work)” found in connection with the festivals, and “no manner of <i>‘m’lachah’</i> (work)” stated in connection with the Sabbath.</i> whatsoever, for He admonishes concerning the Sabbath many times. He further alludes here [to the law that even] when the Sabbath falls on one of [the days of] the festivals, we must not suspend [the law of the Sabbath] so that the preparation of food be permitted on it [as it is on a festival day when it falls on a weekday, but instead it is prohibited]. A similar case [where the phrase <i>these are</i> refers to the continuation of a subject which had previously been mentioned, because in the middle Scripture interrupts with another subject], is the verse, <i>These are the words which the Eternal hath commanded, that ye should do them</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">184</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 35:1.</i> which refers to the Tabernacle and its vessels which he [Moses] will mention in the second section, and [in the next verses] he interrupts with the Sabbath: <i>Six days shall work be done, and on the seventh day there shall be to you a holy day</i> etc.;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">185</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 2.</i> and then he again says, <i>This is the thing which the Eternal commanded … Take ye from among you an offering</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">186</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 4-5.</i> this being the [same] command that Scripture had mentioned at the beginning, but because it was interrupted with another subject, Scripture had to start from the beginning again.<br>Proof for this interpretation is that He does not mention [here] in the case of the Sabbath, <i>and ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the Eternal</i> as He mentions at each and every festival,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">167</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 8, etc.</i> and at the end of the section He states, <i>These are the appointed seasons of the Eternal, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to bring an offering made by fire unto the Eternal … beside the Sabbaths of the Eternal</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">187</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verses 37-38.</i> [This shows] that the Sabbaths are not included within the terms of <i>the appointed seasons of the Eternal</i>. A further proof is that in the second section [i.e., in Verse 4 where He reverts to the festivals after having mentioned the Sabbath], He does not say, <i>And the Eternal spoke unto Moses, saying</i>, as He says in the case of each and every festival;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">188</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 9, etc.</i> for the first communication [to Moses] was indeed concerning the commandments of the festivals, but He mentioned the Sabbath in order to exclude from it the law of the festivals [i.e., that when the Sabbath coincides with a festival, the preparation of food which is permitted on a festival day, is forbidden since it is also a Sabbath, as explained above], but not in order to explain its commandments and laws [and therefore there was no need to repeat the verse, <i>And the Eternal spoke unto Moses, saying</i>]. This is the reason why He does not state [here] about the Sabbath <i>And ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the Eternal</i>, as He states concerning the festivals,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">189</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is because His intention in mentioning the Sabbath was not to explain all its commandments and laws, but only to exclude etc. (as explained in the text).</i> and He mentions it at the end together with the vow-offerings and the freewill-offerings<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">190</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 38: <i>beside the Sabbaths of the Eternal … and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill-offerings</i>.</i> which are not mentioned here, as I have explained [above].

This usage of the word is found already in a Mishnah in Taanith 15 a.</i> <i>Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto him for whom nothing is prepared, for this day is holy unto our Lord; neither be ye grieved, for the joy of the Eternal is your strength</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">193</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nehemiah 8:10.</i> Thus the expression <i>mikra kodesh</i> (<i>a holy convocation</i>) is similar to: <i>‘kru’ei’</i> (<i>those called</i>) <i>of the congregation;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">194</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 1:16.</i> <i>afterwards they eat ‘ha’kru’im’</i> (<i>they that are called</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">195</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 9:13.</i> Similarly, <i>over the whole habitation of Mount Zion, and over ‘mikra’eha’</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">196</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 4:5.</i> meaning the places where they are called to, and where those called of the congregation assemble. Onkelos, however, [in rendering the Hebrew <i>mikra’ei kodesh</i> as <i>m’arei kadish — ”</i>holy events”], understood [the word <i>mikra’ei</i>] as similar to the expression <i>that which ‘yikra’</i> (<i>shall befall</i>) <i>you in the end of days</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">197</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 49:1.</i> an expression of “event,” meaning that whenever the festivals occur, you should make them holy.

This is also the opinion of Onkelos [who translated <i>mikra’ei kodesh</i> as “holy events”]."

                    "YE SHALL DO NO MANNER OF ‘M’LECHETH AVODAH’ (SERVILE WORK). “[Not] even such work as is considered by you important and necessary work, because the neglect of it would involve a monetary loss, as for example a matter that will not permit delay. So I understood from the Torath Kohanim which teaches as follows:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">199</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 12:6.</i> ‘I might think that on intermediate days of the festival<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">200</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the mid-festival days, or the half-festive days between the first and the last days of Passover or of Succoth.</i> it is also forbidden to do <i>m’lecheth avodah</i> (servile work) etc’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">201</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Scripture therefore states with reference to the first and last days of Passover and of Succoth, that it is on them that servile work is forbidden, but not on the intermediate days of the festival.</i> This is Rashi’s language.<br>But this is not correct at all. For what reason is there that Scripture should say, “Do not do [on the festival days even] such work that will not permit delay,” and [the prohibition for] all other labors be deduced by a <i>kal vachomer</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">202</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e. an argument from minor to major. “If work that will not permit delay is forbidden, then surely it is all the more so forbidden if the work can be delayed till after the festival.” See in Vol. II, p. 133, Note 208, on <i>kal vachomer</i>.</i> and if so it would have been proper to say it in the same way in the case of the Sabbath too! [However, with reference to the Sabbath it says <i>Ye shall do ‘no manner’ of ‘m’lachah’</i> (<i>work</i>), and it does not say <i>m’lecheth avodah</i> (servile work) as in the case of the festivals!] Moreover, if it be [as Rashi explained it], then there is an allusion in the Torah to the effect that on the intermediate days of the festival it is permissible to do work that will not permit delay, but the Rabbis have said,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">203</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chagigah 18 a.</i> “Scripture has handed over this matter [of determining which activities are forbidden and which are permitted on the intermediate days of the festival] only to the Sages,” which means that there is no allusion in the Torah as to which work is permitted and which is forbidden! Again, the term <i>avodah</i> (work) includes all kinds of labors and purposes, [as the following verses indicate]: <i>‘oveid’</i> (<i>he that tilleth</i>) <i>his ground shall have plenty of bread;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">204</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 12:11.</i> <i>‘va’avadcha’</i> (<i>he shall serve thee</i>) <i>six years;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">205</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 15:12.</i> <i>‘v’avad’ta’</i> (<i>thou shalt serve</i>) <i>thine enemy</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">206</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 28:48.</i> — and nowhere does the term <i>avodah</i> mean only work that permits no delay, which, if not done today, can no longer be done on the following day [as Rashi had written]!<br>Rather, the meaning of <i>m’lecheth avodah</i> (servile work) is all work that is not necessary in the preparation of food, similar to that which it is said, <i>Six days ‘ta’avod</i> (<i>shalt thou labor</i>)<i>, and do all thy work;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">207</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 20:9.</i> <i>and in all ‘avodah’</i> (<i>manner of work</i>) <i>in the field;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">208</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 1:14.</i> <i>‘v’ne’evadtem’</i> (<i>and ye shall be tilled</i>) <i>and sown;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">209</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 36:9.</i> <i>but Cain was an ‘oved’</i> (<i>tiller</i>) <i>of the ground</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">210</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 4:2.</i> But work which is done in preparation of food is work of direct benefit, and is not [called] <i>m’lecheth avodah</i> (servile work). This [distinction] is clearly explained in the Torah. For with reference to the Festival of Unleavened Bread where He said at first, <i>no manner of work shall be done in them</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">211</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 12:16.</i> it was necessary to explain [in the same verse], <i>Save that which every man must eat, that only may be done by you;</i> therefore with respect to the other festivals He shortened [the command] and said [as in the verse before us], <i>ye shall do no manner of servile work</i>, thus prohibiting all work which is not done in preparation of food, and informing us that the preparation of food is permissible on the festival days. And in no place does Scripture say concerning any of the festival days, that “no manner of work” [shall be done on it] without explaining [immediately] that the preparation of food is permissible on it, because the form <i>m’lecheth avodah</i> (servile work) establishes that principle.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">212</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, when the Torah states concerning any festival, “no manner of ‘servile work’ shall be done on it,” that establishes already the permission to prepare necessary food, since such work is not <i>‘m’lecheth avodah’</i> (servile work). But where Scripture states concerning a festival, “no manner ‘of work’ shall be done on it” [an expression which is similar to that stated concerning the Sabbath], then it is always followed with a permission for the preparing of necessary food, since the term “work” is inclusive of all labors.</i> However, in the section of <i>All the firstling males</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">213</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 15:19.</i> [where all the festivals are mentioned], He states with reference to the Festival of Unleavened Bread, <i>and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the Eternal thy G-d; thou shalt do no work therein</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">214</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 16:8.</i> [and yet Scripture does <i>not</i> follow it up with a permission for preparing food]! The reason for this is that He had already clearly permitted<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">215</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Exodus 12:16 — quoted above.</i> the preparation of food on it [Passover], and it was therefore no longer necessary [there in the section of <i>All the firstling males</i>] to say in connection with it: “all manner of servile work.” He mentioned there merely “work” (<i>thou shalt do no ‘work’ therein</i>),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">214</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 16:8.</i> and did not say <i>kol m’lachah</i> (“all work” or “any manner of work”) as He said with reference to the Sabbath<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">176</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 3.</i> and the Day of Atonement,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">216</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 28.</i> because the intention is, “Do not do that work about which I have admonished you [elsewhere, i.e., ‘servile work’].”<br>Now Rabbi Chananel<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">217</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See above in <i>Seder Kedoshim</i> Note 286. It is important to note that in the printed editions of Ramban the text here is “Rabbi Abraham” (ibn Ezra) instead of “Rabbi [or Rabbeinu] Chananel,” as found in Ramban manuscripts. It is, however, not found at all in Ibn Ezra’s commentaries, thus proving that the correct reading is “Rabbeinu Chananel.” Ramban’s interpretation of the term <i>m’lecheth avodah</i>, as substantiated by Rabbeinu Chananel, has had a wide influence on the whole concept of “work” on the festivals (see an article of mine in “Hadarom,” No. 34, pp. 234-237).</i> wrote: “<i>Do no manner of ‘m’lecheth avodah’</i> (<i>servile work</i>). This teaches that He only permitted [on a festival day] the preparation of food, as it is written in connection with this matter in another place: <i>And in the first day</i> [of Passover] <i>there shall be to you a holy convocation, and in the seventh day a holy convocation; no manner of work shall be done in them</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">211</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 12:16.</i> And because He mentioned there <i>any manner of work</i> [which indicates a prohibition covering even preparation of food], it was essential that He should explain [in the same verse]: <i>save that which every man must eat, that only may be done by you</i>. The meaning of <i>m’lecheth avodah</i> is work for the purpose of material possessions, such as sowing, harvesting, digging and the like, but the preparation of food is not <i>m’lecheth avodah</i>.” This is Rabbeinu Chananel’s language.<br>And the Beraitha in the Torath Kohanim [which Rashi quoted at the beginning of the section] is taught as follows in the correct texts thereof:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">218</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 12:5-8. See also in Vol. II, p. 106, Note 45 on Rabbeinu Chananel.</i> “<i>Do no manner of ‘m’lecheth avodah.’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">219</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 36. See my Hebrew commentary p. 145, that this is the correct reading here. It is this verse which is clearly referred to by Ramban when he begins the interpretation of the Beraitha.</i> This is intended to elucidate [the law] about the intermediate days of the festival, that it is prohibited to do work on them. I might think that any manner of <i>m’lecheth avodah</i> (servile work) is forbidden on them. Scripture therefore states <i>it</i> [i.e., the eighth day of Tabernacles, <i>is a day of solemn assembly</i>],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">220</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 36. See my Hebrew commentary p. 145.</i> meaning: <i>it</i> is a day on which all manner of servile work is forbidden, but on the intermediate days [of the festival] such work is not forbidden. These are the words of Rabbi Yosei the Galilean. Rabbi Akiba says: What need is there for Scripture to say: <i>These are the appointed seasons of the Eternal which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">221</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 37.</i> If it refers to the festivals, they are each stated [separately]! If so, why is it said, <i>These are the appointed seasons of the Eternal, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations</i>? This refers to the intermediate days of the festival, on which the doing of work is forbidden. I might think that all manner of servile work is forbidden to be done on them. Scripture therefore states, <i>it</i> etc.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">220</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 36. See my Hebrew commentary p. 145.</i> [as quoted above].<br>The explanation of this Beraitha is [as follows]: Rabbi Yosei the Galilean interprets the verses, <i>Ye shall do</i> [<i>no manner of servile work</i>],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">220</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 36. See my Hebrew commentary p. 145.</i> and <i>These are the appointed seasons of the Eternal</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">221</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 37.</i> as meaning that Scripture prohibits the doing of work on all [the days] which are termed “the appointed festivals of the Eternal.” Thus I might think that they are all alike with respect to this prohibition, and that any manner of servile work is prohibited to be done on [the intermediate days of the festival] just as on the first and eighth days [of Tabernacles], and [then] we would interpret the verses thus: <i>Ye shall do no manner of servile work. These are the appointed seasons of the Eternal</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">222</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verses 36 and 37 are thus combined to yield this thought.</i> since a verse may be interpreted together with an antecedent phrase or even together with a penultimate phrase.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">223</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shabbath 32 b. In the case before us, Verse 37 [<i>These are the appointed seasons of the Eternal</i>] is explained by an antecedent phrase in Verse 36 [<i>Ye shall do no manner of servile work</i>]. Ramban in speaking of “a penultimate phrase” is merely completing the quotation of the Talmudic saying, but the intent here is perforce to “an antecedent phrase.”</i> It is for this reason that Scripture excludes it by saying, <i>‘it’ is a day of solemn assembly; ye shall do no manner of servile work</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">221</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 37.</i> meaning: “the eighth day [of Tabernacles] is restricted as regards all servile work, but on the intermediate days of the festival the prohibition is not like that of [the eighth day], affecting all manner of ‘servile work,’ but it is only ‘work’ which He said they must not do,” and [the precise nature of the work forbidden on the intermediate days of the festival] Scripture did not mention, nor did it allude to it at all, but entrusted it to the Sages [to establish which work is permitted and which is prohibited]. The text which Rashi brings [further on in Verse 36]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">224</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“<i>Ye shall do no manner of servile work</i>. I might think that it is forbidden to do servile work also on the intermediate days of the festival. Scripture therefore states <i>it</i> (the eighth day of Tabernacles) <i>is a day of solemn assembly</i> [but not the intermediate days]” (Rashi, Verse 36).</i> is also to be explained in this way.<br>This Beraitha [of the Torath Kohanim] is taught in the Gemara of Tractate Chagigah in the following way:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">225</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chagigah 18 a.</i> “<i>Ye shall do no manner of servile work</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">226</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 8, referring to the seventh day of Passover, which is a full festival day as is the eighth day of Tabernacles.</i> This teaches us about the intermediate days of the festival, that it is forbidden to do work [on them]. These are the words of Rabbi Yosei the Galilean. Rabbi Akiba says etc.” [as quoted above]. And there [in Tractate Chagigah] it is further taught: “Just as [servile work] is forbidden on the seventh day [of Passover], so also it is forbidden on the sixth day; if so [I might think], just as the seventh day is restricted with respect to all work,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">227</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As it is stated in Deuteronomy 16:8 with reference to the Passover: <i>and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly … thou shalt do no work therein</i>. Since it does not state “servile work,” the restriction would seem to apply to “all work,” as the Gemara expresses it. Now Ramban has already explained above that the real intention of this verse in Deuteronomy is “servile work,” and the reason why it mentions “work,” is because Scripture has already explained (in Exodus 12:16 — see Note 215), that it applies specifically to “servile work.” The argument of the Gemara, however, merely proceeds on the basis of the expression as stated there in Deuteronomy. Further on in the text Ramban will again remove this difficulty in accordance with this line of thought, by saying that the Gemara is merely following the expressio of the verse.</i> so also the sixth day [as well as the other intermediate days of the festival] are restricted with respect to all work. Scripture therefore states <i>‘ha’shvi’i’</i>, (<i>‘the’ seventh day</i>),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">228</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 16:8. The definite article in [<i>ha’shvi’i</i>] is limiting, meaning: only on the seventh day are you so restricted, but not on the preceding intermediate days.</i> meaning: “the seventh day is restricted with regard to all work, but the sixth day is not restricted with respect to all work, for Scripture entrusted [the determining of which work is permitted and which is forbidden] only to the Sages, etc.” Now the Gemara states that [on the seventh day of the festival we are] restricted against doing “all work,” but the Torath Kohanim [mentioned above] states “all servile work.” This is because in the interpretation [of the Gemara] the Sages chose the wording of the Scriptural text [and since in Deuteronomy 16:8 it says with reference to the seventh day of Passover, <i>thou shalt do no ‘work’ therein</i>, the Gemara followed that expression, but the intention is really only to “servile work”], for with respect to a festival it cannot be said that “all work” is forbidden therein, but only “all servile work.” Thus both [the Torath Kohanim and the Gemara] meant the same thing, namely, that on the festival days all manner of servile work is forbidden, but on the intermediate days of the festival all manner of servile work is not forbidden; however, forbidden are those kinds of labor which [although] have not been set forth in the Torah, but which Scripture entrusted to the Sages [to be specified as forbidden].<br>And in the Sifre [we have been taught]:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">229</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifre, <i>R’eih</i> 135.</i> “Rabbi Yishmael says: Since we have not been instructed that on the intermediate days of a festival it is forbidden to do work, therefore Scripture states, <i>Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">214</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 16:8.</i> [thus teaching that] just as the seventh day is restricted [as regarding work], so also is the sixth day [and all intermediate days of the festival] restricted. Now I might think that just as the seventh day is restricted with regard to all work, so also is the sixth day restricted with regard to all work. Scripture therefore states <i>‘the’ seventh day</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">228</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 16:8. The definite article in [<i>ha’shvi’i</i>] is limiting, meaning: only on the seventh day are you so restricted, but not on the preceding intermediate days.</i> thus teaching that the seventh day is restricted with regard to all work, but the sixth day is not restricted with respect to all work.” This Beraitha too [speaking of “all work” being prohibited on the seventh day of Passover] is to be explained in accordance with the principle we have laid down [i.e., that the intention is “all servile work,” the Beraitha merely following the language of the verse, as explained above]. Thus we have discussed at length the matter of the Beraithoth dealing with this subject, in order that the words of our Rabbis, of blessed memory, should conform with the clear and correct interpretation which we have said of these verses.<br>Yet despite all this, I have found a contradiction to our words from a Beraitha taught in the Sifre:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">230</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, <i>Pinchas</i> 147.</i> “<i>Ye shall do no manner of ‘m’lecheth avodah’</i> (<i>servile work</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">231</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 28:18 (with respect to the first day of Passover).</i> This teaches that the doing of work [on the first day of Passover] is forbidden. How do we know that the preparation of food is permitted thereon? Here it is stated <i>a holy convocation</i> [<i>In the first day shall be ‘a holy convocation'; ye shall do no manner of servile work</i>], and there<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">232</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Exodus 12:16.</i> it is said [with respect to the same day] <i>a holy convocation</i>. Now just as there [the verse explicitly] permits preparing food, so here too the intention is to permit the preparation of food [on the same day].”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">233</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Now this Beraitha is clearly in contradiction to Ramban’s opinion above, that the term <i>‘m’lecheth avodah’</i> (servile work) does <i>not</i> include a prohibition against preparing necessary food on a festival. For if so, seeing that with respect to the first day of Passover it states in Numbers 28:18: <i>Ye shall do no manner of ‘m’lecheth avodah,’</i> why then did the Sifre have to search for a special source to establish the permissibility of preparing necessary food? Ramban will now proceed to remove this contradiction.</i><br>It appears to me that the term <i>avodah</i> was understood by our Rabbis, of blessed memory, in the sense of labor and toil which one does for another, [the usage being] similar to these expressions: <i>‘avodath aved’</i> (<i>the work of a bondservant</i>);<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">234</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 25:39.</i> <i>‘eved avadim’</i> (<i>a servant of servants</i>) <i>shall he be unto his brethren;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">235</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 9:25.</i> <i>‘avdu’</i> (<i>they served</i>) <i>Chedorlaomer</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">236</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 14:4.</i> Similarly: <i>‘avodath avodah va’avodath masa’</i> (<i>the work of service, and the work of bearing burdens</i>),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">237</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 4:47.</i> which means the work of any task in the Tent [of Meeting], and the work of [bearing] burdens upon the shoulder. If so, it would be possible [to think] that light works which one does for one’s own enjoyment are permissible, even though they are not for the preparation of food, while those difficult labors done in the course of preparation of food, which a servant performs for his master, are forbidden to be done. Therefore this [Beraitha just quoted from the Sifre] asked: “Whence do we know that this permission [for certain works] refers to preparation of food, so that all work done in the preparation of food is permissible, even if it involves difficult labor, and that we should prohibit all other kinds of work, for even the easiest of them are called <i>m’lecheth avodah</i>? From the similarity of phrases, <i>a holy convocation</i>, for there<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">232</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Exodus 12:16.</i> it is indicated that all works [even easy ones] are prohibited, and all works done for the preparation of food [even those difficult tasks that a servant does for his master, such as cooking, baking, etc.] are permitted to be done.”<br>Now I have seen the following text taught in the Mechilta:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">238</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mechilta, <i>Pis’cha</i> 9.</i> “<i>Save that which every man must eat, that only may be done by you</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">232</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Exodus 12:16.</i> All works necessary for the preparation of food overrule the festival, but not all Services [in the Sanctuary, as will be explained] overrule the festival. Now [the argument may be advanced]: Let some works done for the preparation of food overrule the Sabbath! And the following reasoning would favor it: If in a situation when all Services do not overrule the festival, nonetheless all works necessary for the preparation of food do overrule the festival, then in the situation where some Services [in the Sanctuary] do overrule the Sabbath, is it not logical that some works done for the preparation of food overrule the Sabbath! Scripture therefore states, <i>Save that which every man must eat</i>, [<i>that only may be done by you</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">232</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Exodus 12:16.</i> — on the festival, but not on the Sabbath. It is thus established that although] some Services [in the Sanctuary] overrule the Sabbath, no work for the preparation of food may overrule the Sabbath.” Now the meaning of the phrase [in the Beraitha] “some Services [in the Sanctuary which overrule the Sabbath],” is such things as offerings which are obligatory for the day, these being the Daily Whole-offering and the Additional Offerings; “but the festival is not overruled by all Services [in the Sanctuary],” these are vow-offerings and freewill-offerings [of individuals], or a freewill burnt-offering [which, although wholly for the altar, may yet not be offered on a festival]. But the meaning of the phrase [“is it not logical that] <i>some</i> works for the preparation of food [overrule the Sabbath]” has not been clarified to me. However, it alludes to what we have said, that work which is accomplished by means of great toil, akin to work [which a servant does for his master], is included in the prohibition, but that which is accomplished easily, and is customary for a man to do for himself, is permitted; or “some works” may mean [those necessary] for maintenance of life, and “all works” may mean abundance of dishes for pleasure. The principle then of <i>‘m’lecheth avodah’</i> [servile work — stated in the case of the festivals], is thus to permit the preparation of food [since that is not within the terms of “servile work” which is forbidden on the festival]."

If, however, the expression <i>on the morrow after ‘ha’shabbath’</i> means “on the morrow after [the first day of] the festival,” in accordance with the tradition of our Rabbis, then the matter appears correctly. For at first Scripture commanded that we should observe in the first month the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">246</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 6.</i> and that on the first day there should be a solemn rest and on the seventh day a solemn rest,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">247</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban’s language here follows that of Verse 39 with reference to the eight days of Tabernacles.</i> and we are not to do thereon any manner of servile work. Afterwards He stated that when we come into the Land we are to bring on the morrow of this rest-day [previously] mentioned, <i>the sheaf of the waving</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">248</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 15.</i> this being the first rest-day here mentioned. And He also taught that the [bringing of the] sheaf was not obligatory in the desert, nor outside the Land [since the section begins, <i>When ye are come into the Land</i> …]. However, the expressions, <i>even unto the morrow after ‘ha’shabbath’ the seventh</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">249</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 16.</i> and <i>seven ‘shabbathoth’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">248</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 15.</i> cannot possibly be interpreted as referring to a festival [as does the expression <i>on the morrow after ‘ha’shabbath’</i> here in Verse 11 and also further in Verse 15.] Onkelos, however, rendered them as meaning “week”, but if so, there are two different usages of the same word in one verse!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">250</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 15 reads: <i>And ye shall count unto you from the morrow of ‘ha’shabbath’ … seven ‘shabbathoth’ shall there be complete</i>. According to Onkelos the first <i>ha’shabbath</i> means “the festival,” while the second <i>shabbathoth</i> means “weeks.”</i> And the commentators<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">251</sup><i class=\"footnote\">So interpreted by Ibn Ezra.</i> have written that this is a literary expression [Scripture using one term in the same instance with two different meanings], such as: <i>they rode on thirty ‘a’yarim’</i> (<i>ass colts</i>) <i>and they had thirty ‘a’yarim’</i> (<i>cities</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">252</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Judges 10:4.

One cannot mistake the expression [<i>ha’shabbath</i>] as referring to the <i>fourteenth</i> day [of Nisan, thus making the offering of the <i>omer</i>, brought on the morrow, to be on the <i>fifteenth</i> day of Nisan, the first day of Passover], for of that fourteenth day He has said that only <i>at dusk</i> [<i>is the Eternal’s Passover</i>].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">258</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 5. — Thus it is clear that the Festival of Passover begins on the fourteenth of Nisan at dusk, and the first <i>day</i> of the festival is the next day, i.e., the fifteenth. Hence <i>on the morrow after ‘ha’shabbath’</i> must refer to the expression <i>and on the fifteenth day</i> etc. (in Verse 6), thus establishing that it is on the <i>sixteenth</i> day of Nisan that we are to begin a new week — the first of the seven complete weeks.</i> And the meaning of <i>they shall be complete</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">248</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 15.</i> is that a Sabbath together with its six days is called “a whole” Sabbath. And the meaning of the expression <i>mimachorath ha’shabbath</i> [literally: “<i>from</i> the morrow of the <i>shabbath</i>”] is like <i>b’machorath ha’shabbath</i> (“<i>on</i> the morrow of the <i>shabbath</i>”). Similarly, <i>Even unto ‘mimachorath ha’shabbath’ the seventh, shall ye number</i> [<i>fifty days</i>]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">259</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “Even unto <i>from</i> the morrow after the seventh week …” This cannot be understood literally, for it would mean that the festival day of Shevuoth is to be observed on the day “<i>from</i> the morrow after the seventh week, i.e., <i>on the following day after the morrow</i> of the seven weeks.” Instead, it must mean: “Even unto <i>on</i> the morrow …”</i> [is like <i>b’machorath ha’shabbath</i> (“<i>on</i> the morrow of the <i>shabbath</i>”)] So also: <i>It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it u’mimachorath</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">260</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 19:6.

Hence “the counting” of the seven clean days which the Torah mentioned that they must do could not be in the nature of a positive act — counting by word of mouth — but merely a warning that they should not forget their state of impurity. However, in the case of the counting of the <i>omer</i>, this reasoning is inapplicable, since the observance of Shevuoth on the fiftieth day is not a matter of choice, hence “the counting” must mean by word of mouth.</i> Similarly, <i>And thou shall number ‘lecha’</i> (<i>unto thee</i>) <i>seven Sabbaths of years</i> etc.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">269</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further 25:8.</i> of the Jubilee, means [only] that you shall be heedful of the number so that you should not forget [when the Jubilee year falls, but the actual counting of the years does not have to be by word of mouth].

                    "AND YE SHALL OFFER A NEW MEAL-OFFERING UNTO THE ETERNAL.

Since the destruction of the Sanctuary, the prohibition extends to the whole day of the sixteenth of Nisan (Rosh Hashanah 30 a-b; see also “The Commandments,” Vol. II, pp. 186-188).</i> [and the Festival of Weeks is connected] with <i>the new meal-offering</i> [mentioned in the verse before us]. Thus this verse is intended to state that even after our exile to countries outside the Land, when the <i>omer</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">243</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “a measure.” This refers to the meal-offering of the new barley brought on the second day of Passover, which is the sixteenth day of Nisan.

Thus it is clear that the time of this festival is dependent upon the <i>omer</i>.</i> and the [new] meal-offering are no longer offered, He nonetheless commanded concerning the observance [of the law of the new crop and resting on the festival], for the [prohibition against eating of the] new crop applies by law of the Torah in all places. It was not necessary to mention this in connection with the Day of Remembrance [i.e., the New Year], and similarly in connection with the Festival of Tabernacles He did not mention [that it is to be observed] “in all your dwellings” [because these two festivals are clearly not dependent upon the offerings in the Sanctuary]. He did, however, mention it with reference to the Day of Atonement,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">286</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 31.</i> because since He had made our atonement dependent upon the offerings, as he mentioned in the section of <i>Acharei Moth</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">287</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Chapter 16.</i> therefore He said here that the prohibition [of eating and working on that day] applies in all places [and at all times], as He stated <i>it is a day of atonement, to make atonement for you</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">288</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 28.</i> by fasting and resting from work, and [the absence of] the offerings does not prevent His [granting of] atonement.

It is because I might have thought that since this prohibition is written in connection with the offerings, therefore when there are offerings [i.e., when the Sanctuary is in existence] the prohibition is applicable, and when there are no offerings it is not applicable, thus the Torah wanted to teach us [that it is always applicable].” There [in Tractate Kiddushin]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">298</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kiddushin 37 b.</i> the Rabbis also said: “Why did the Merciful One write [here in this section — in Verse 3] the expression <i>in all your dwellings</i> with reference to the Sabbath? It is because I might have thought that since it is written in connection with the festivals, the Sabbath should require sanctification by the court just as the festivals do, therefore the Torah wanted to teach us [that the Sabbath is independent of sanctification by the court]. The principle then is that the Torah does not mention this expression [<i>in all your dwellings</i>] with reference to any commandment which is a personal obligation, unless there is a necessity for some reason.<br>Now the expression: <i>‘out of your dwellings’ ye shall bring two wave-loaves</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">299</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 17.</i> [on the Festival of Weeks], is not similar to “out of <i>all</i> your dwellings.” Rather, its meaning is: “<i>out of</i> the Land of <i>your dwellings</i>,” excluding [the obligation to bring two loaves from the produce of] outside the Land of Israel, just as it is said, <i>When ye come into the Land of your habitations which I give unto you</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">300</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers, 15:2.</i> And so the Rabbis have taught [in a Mishnah]:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">301</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Menachoth 83 b.</i> “All the [meal-]offerings of the public or of an individual may come from the produce of the Land or outside the Land, save only the <i>omer</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">243</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “a measure.” This refers to the meal-offering of the new barley brought on the second day of Passover, which is the sixteenth day of Nisan.

Thus it is clear that the time of this festival is dependent upon the <i>omer</i>.</i> and the two loaves.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">299</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 17.</i> And even according to the Sage who says<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">302</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 84 a.

                    "IT SHALL BE UNTO YOU ‘SHABBATHON’ (A SOLEMN REST). This means that it is to be a day of rest, to repose thereon [from work]. And our Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">318</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shabbath 24 b.</i> “The word <i>shabbathon</i> (a solemn rest) amounts to a positive commandment.” Thus one who does work on a festival day transgresses both a negative commandment and a positive commandment, and one who rests thereon fulfills a positive commandment.

Has it not already been stated, <i>no manner of work shall be done in them?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">324</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 16.</i> From this I would know only about matters which are considered <i>m’lachah</i> [‘work’ on the Sabbath, and thus forbidden by the Torah]. How do I know about activities which are termed <i>sh’vuth</i> [as explained later on]? From the verse which states, <i>and ye shall observe this day</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">323</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 12:17.</i> which includes those activities which are termed <i>sh’vuth</i>. I might then think that on the intermediate days of the festival those activities known as <i>sh’vuth</i> are likewise forbidden, and the following reasoning would favor it etc;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">325</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Since the expression <i>holy convocation</i> is stated both with reference to the first and seventh days of Passover (<i>ibid.</i>, Verse 16), and the intermediate days of the festival are similarly termed [in the verse, <i>These are the appointed seasons of the Eternal, even holy convocations</i> — Verse 4 in the section before us], therefore just as activities called <i>sh’vuth</i> are forbidden on the first and seventh days, so are they also forbidden on the intermediate days of the festival.” — So it could be argued.</i> Scripture therefore states [with reference to the Festival of Tabernacles], <i>On the first day shall be a solemn rest</i>”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">326</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 39.</i> [but not on the following intermediate days of the festival].<br>Thus the Sages interpreted the word <i>shabbathon</i> as indicating a complete rest on that day, desisting even from those activities which are not of the chief labors or their derivatives. But this interpretation is not clear to me. For if you say that this Mechilta is a mere Scriptural support for a Rabbinic ordinance, what reason is there for the Rabbis to use this language [i.e., “How do I know about activities which are termed <i>sh’vuth</i>?” when instead they should have said, “How do I know about activities which are not regarded as <i>m’lachah?</i>”], for the term <i>sh’vuth</i> in the language of the Sages is always used with reference to activities forbidden by the Rabbis; and so how is it possible to say, “How do I know that activities which are forbidden on account of <i>sh’vuth</i> instituted by the Rabbis, are forbidden on the basis of a verse [in Scripture]!” The way in which such [Beraithoth make use of] Scriptural texts as a support for Rabbinical enactments, is by teaching [an interpretation in a verse] showing that they [such Rabbinical enactments] are based on the Torah, but they never say, “That activity which is forbidden by the Sages, from what verse in the Torah do we derive it?” Instead, this [Beraitha of the Mechilta] should have stated, “Activities which are not in the category of <i>m’lachah</i> (‘work’),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">327</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There are thirty-nine main classes of “work” (Shabbath 73 a). Their subspecies are also subject to the same regulations (Baba Kama 2 a). The intention here, then, is to find a source for such kinds of activity which are neither “work” nor any of its derivatives. Examples are mentioned further on in the text.</i> whence do we know that they are forbidden? From the word <i>shabbathon</i>!”<br>It appears to me that this interpretation intends to state that we are commanded by law of the Torah to have rest on a festival day even from activities which are not in the category of <i>m’lachah</i> (“work”).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">327</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There are thirty-nine main classes of “work” (Shabbath 73 a).

The intention here, then, is to find a source for such kinds of activity which are neither “work” nor any of its derivatives. Examples are mentioned further on in the text.</i><br>Thus we are not to be engaged the whole day in wearisome tasks: measuring out crops of the field, weighing fruits and gifts, filling the barrels with wine and clearing away the vessels, and moving stones from house to house and from place to place [although none of these activities is “work” in the strict sense of the term]. Similarly, if it be a city encompassed by a wall and its gates are locked at night, [and it is therefore according to law of the Torah treated as one domain, and the prohibition against taking out aught from one domain to another is inapplicable there], they would be loading heaps on asses, <i>as also wine, grapes, and figs and all manner of burdens</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">328</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nehemiah 13:15.</i> they would bring on a festival; and the market place would be full for all business transactions, the shops standing open and the shopkeepers giving credit,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">329</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Aboth 3:16.</i> the money-changers sitting before their tables with the golden coins before them, and the workers would rise early to go to their work and hire themselves out for such works [as described above] just as on weekdays, and so on! And since all these matters do not entail <i>m’lachah</i>, they would be permissible on a festival day and even on the Sabbath itself! Therefore the Torah said that [the festival should be a day of] <i>shabbathon</i> (solemn rest), meaning that it should be a day of rest and ease, not a day of labor [and weariness]. This is a good and beautiful interpretation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">330</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ramban in Exodus 12:16 (towards the end) where he refers to this interpretation that he intended yet to write, and see also there, p. 134, Note 213.</i><br>Afterwards I saw the other Mechilta of Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">331</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The standard Mechilta being that of Rabbi Yishmael [a colleague of Rabbi Akiba], Ramban here refers to another Mechilta which he specifies by name: “the Mechilta of Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai.” Hence the epithet “the other Mechilta.” [See, however, in Vol. I, p. 603, where this epithet is not used by Ramban.] Rabbi Shimon was a pupil of Rabbi Akiba. The text quoted is found in that work on Exodus 12:16.</i> where it is taught in another form: “I know only that it is forbidden [on a festival day to do] the kind of work for which, [if transgressed on the Sabbath through error], one must bring a sin-offering. How do I know that [it is forbidden to do] such works [on a festival day] for which one does not have to bring a sin-offering [if transgressed through error on the Sabbath], such as climbing a tree or riding on animals or swimming in the water, or slapping one’s thighs or clapping one’s hands? From the verse, <i>no manner of work shall be done in them</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">332</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 12:16, stated with reference to the first and seventh days of Passover.</i> I know only concerning acts of [one’s own] choice. How do I know concerning acts commanded [in the Torah], that we may not dedicate anything [to the Temple treasury], or make a vow of valuation, or devote anything [for Temple repairs, or for the priests], or set apart the heave-offering or the tithes? From the expression <i>shabbathon</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">333</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Verse 24 before us with reference to the New Year, and as explained above all festivals have been likened one to another. See Note 320.</i> which means <i>sh’vuth</i>” (rest, abstention from ordinary occupation). In a similar way this [Beraitha] is taught in the Torath Kohanim with reference to the Day of Atonement.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">334</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Acharei</i> 7:9.</i> Now although these Beraithoth<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">335</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On the meaning of this term see above in <i>Seder Vayikra</i>, Note 65.</i> differ in their language and in their interpretations, perhaps they all intend one common thing, namely, to find some Scriptural support for activities forbidden by the Rabbis. But nonetheless, whether the interpretation of the first Beraitha [mentioned above] be as we have said [i.e., that it is forbidden by <i>Scriptural law</i> to do on a festival day activities which are not strictly speaking “work,” but are wearisome labors], or whether all [these Beraithoth] intend only to find a Scriptural support for matters forbidden by the Rabbis, the meaning of the term <i>shabbathon</i> is as we have explained, namely, that we should have a day of repose from labor and toil. This is indeed a very proper and excellent interpretation.<br>Thus we have been prohibited from doing [any of the main classes of] “work” on the Sabbath by a negative commandment,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">336</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 20:10.</i> and [for the intentional transgression thereof is prescribed] the punishment of excision [if the court has no knowledge of the transgression or there are no witnesses, but if there are witnesses who testify, the punishment] is death — but as for labors and toils [which are not strictly speaking “work”], we are commanded by means of this positive commandment;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">337</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For of the Sabbath it is likewise said <i>shabbathon</i> (here in Verse 3): <i>Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh it is a Sabbath of ‘shabbathon’</i> (<i>solemn rest</i>).</i> and on a festival day we are prohibited from doing “work” by a negative commandment, [the punishment for the intentional transgression thereof being whipping], and the doing of labors [which are not strictly speaking “work”] we are forbidden by means of a positive commandment. It is on this basis that the prophet [Isaiah] said, <i>If thou turn away thy foot because of the Sabbath, from pursuing thy business on My holy day … not doing thy wonted ways, nor pursuing thy business, nor speaking thereof;</i> [<i>then shalt thou delight thyself in the Eternal</i>].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">338</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 58:13-14.</i> Similarly, <i>a Sabbath of ‘shabbathon’</i> (<i>solemn rest</i>) <i>shall be for the Land</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">339</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 25:4.</i> means that [the seventh year] shall be a Sabbath of rest, that one is not to plow nor cultivate the Land at all. It is because of this that the Sages have interpreted [in the first Beraitha mentioned above] that on the intermediate days of the festival those activities known as <i>sh’vuth</i> are not forbidden. But this is only according to the law of the Torah, for by Rabbinic enactment whatever one may not do oneself one is not permitted to say to a non-Jew to do, since even with reference to the Rabbinic prohibition against telling [a non-Jew to do work], the Sages were strict [in not permitting it on an intermediate day of the festival].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">340</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Moed Katan 12 a. Thus since the Rabbis forbade even a <i>sh’vuth</i> involving only speech, it is clear that they prohibited every <i>sh’vuth</i> involving action.</i>",

On this statement of the Beraitha the Rabbis of the Gemara asked:] “Surely this is so! The blowing of the <i>Shofar</i> is commanded by law of the Torah, and the recitation of the verses is only by law of the Rabbis [and what need is there for the Beraitha to teach me that the law of the Torah takes precedence!” To this the Gemara answered: “The Beraitha is] necessary only to teach this in a case where one is certain and one is in doubt.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">347</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even if there is only a doubt whether there will be a <i>Shofar</i> in one community, whilst in the other it is certain that they will recite the Service, but without the sounding of the <i>Shofar</i>, the Beraitha teaches that we are yet to go to the place where there is a possibility of the <i>Shofar</i> being blown, even though there is a doubt about it.</i><br>Rather, the expression <i>a memorial of ‘t’ruah’</i> is like the verse, <i>it shall be a day of ‘t’ruah’ unto you</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">348</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 29:1.</i> Scripture stating that we are to blow [the <i>Shofar</i>] on that day, and this shall be to us for a memorial before G-d, as it is said further on, <i>and ye shall blow with the trumpets</i> [<i>over your burnt-offerings, and over the offerings of your peace-offerings</i>]<i>, and they shall be to you for a memorial before your G-d</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">342</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 10:10.</i> And since He said there, <i>And in the day of your gladness, and in your appointed seasons, and in your New Moons, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt-offerings, and over the offerings of your peace-offerings</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">342</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 10:10.</i> whereas here He commanded only a <i>t’ruah</i> [a blast of the horn] for this festival [the New Year], and following it He said, <i>and ye shall bring an offering made by fire</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">349</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 25 here.</i> we deduce that this <i>t’ruah</i> [mentioned here] is not the same blowing which was done with the [silver] trumpets over the offerings. We furthermore [deduce] that this <i>t’ruah</i> here was not done over the offerings, but it is obligatory upon all Israel [wherever they are], and is to be done with the <i>Shofar</i> [the ram’s horn], for he had not yet commanded him [Moses] to make the trumpets, and all unqualified expressions of <i>t’ruah</i> are done with the <i>Shofar</i>, as it is said, <i>And thou shalt make proclamation with ‘shofar t’ruah’</i> (<i>the blast of the horn</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">350</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 25:9.</i><br>Now Scripture did not explain the reason for this commandment, why [we must do] the blowing [of the horn], and why we need a memorial before G-d on this day more than on all other days, and why He commanded altogether that this day should be a holy convocation. But because this day comes at the beginning of the month in which the Day of Atonement occurs, it would appear that on the New Year there is a judgment before Him, blessed be He, <i>for by these He judgeth the peoples</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">351</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 36:31.</i> on the New Year He sits <i>upon the throne as the righteous Judge</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">352</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 9:5.</i> and afterwards in the course of the next ten days He forgives the transgression of His servants.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">353</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Genesis 50:17.</i> Scripture is thus alluding to this matter which is well-known in Israel by word of the prophets and our holy ancestors.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">354</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Up to Moses our teacher, and it is still with us as a matter of tradition and as is known in the Talmud.

                    "ACH’ (BUT) ON THE TENTH DAY OF THIS SEVENTH MONTH IS THE DAY OF ATONEMENT. “All expressions in the Torah of <i>ach</i> (but) and <i>rak</i> (only) indicate limiting qualifications, [and here the word <i>ach</i> indicates that the Day of Atonement] effects atonement ‘only’ for those who repent, but it does not effect atonement for those who do not repent.” This is Rashi’s language on the basis of the words of our Rabbis.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">375</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shebuoth 13 a.</i> And if so, the explanation of the verse is that on the first day of this month [Tishri] there will be for all of you a day of <i>memorial of ‘t’ruah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">376</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 24.</i> [a blowing of the quavering sound which signifies judgment], for you will all be judged then before Him, but for some of you [i.e., those who repent] there will be on the tenth day of this month a day of atonement. Thus the meaning of the word <i>ach</i> is like that of <i>bilvad</i> (“only,” “alone”). Similarly, <i>Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my son ‘ach’</i> (<i>only</i>) <i>this once</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">377</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 10:17.</i> So also, <i>‘harak ach b’Moshe’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">378</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 12:2.</i> means “has He indeed spoken ‘only’ with Moses?” Likewise, <i>‘Ach’ on the fifteenth day of the seventh month</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">379</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 39.</i> means “only on the fifteenth day [of Tishri] <i>ye shall keep the feast of the Eternal seven days</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">379</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 39.</i> not consecutively,” for the Festival-offering [brought by the individual]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">380</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the Festival peace-offering which one is obliged to bring when making the pilgrimage to the Sanctuary three times in the year (see “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 60-61).</i> does not override the Sabbath [and therefore it cannot mean seven days consecutively]. In the same way you are to explain [the word <i>ach</i>] in all the commandments, in accordance with the tradition of our Rabbis. Similarly, <i>‘ach’ he is torn in pieces</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">381</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 44:28.</i> means [that Jacob said] that nothing else [could have happened to Joseph] except that he was torn in pieces. So also, <i>For the children of Israel and the children of Judah ‘ach’ have done that which was evil in My sight from their youth; for the children of Israel have ‘ach’ provoked Me</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">382</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 32:30.</i> means that they have done nothing else.<br>But by way of the plain meaning of Scripture the word <i>ach</i> means <i>achein</i> (“surely”), [a word which is used] to authenticate something, [as in the following expressions]: <i>‘achein’</i> (<i>surely</i>) <i>the thing is known;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">383</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 2:14.</i> <i>‘achein’</i> (<i>surely</i>) <i>ye shall die like men</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">384</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 82:7.</i> And here it means, “Surely on the tenth day of the seventh month is the day of atonement,” the expression constituting a [Divine] assurance on the authenticity of the matter, Scripture stating: “On the first day of the month is the day of judgment, but indeed on the tenth of the month is the day of atonement, therefore you shall afflict your souls, and you shall do no manner of work.” Similarly, <i>‘ach’</i> (<i>surely</i>) <i>thou art my bone and my flesh;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">385</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 29:14.</i> <i>‘ach’</i> (<i>surely</i>) <i>it is the king of Israel;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">386</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Kings 22:32.</i> <i>‘ach’</i> (<i>surely</i>) <i>G-d is good to Israel, even to such as are pure in heart</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">387</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 73:1.</i> So also is the meaning of the verse, <i>‘ach’ ye shall keep My Sabbaths</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">388</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 31:13.</i> which declares: “Now I have commanded you concerning the work of the Tabernacle, but surely My Sabbaths you shall keep forever.” So also in all cases [where the word <i>ach</i> is mentioned] it may be explained to you in this way, if you will understand them."

                    "B’ETZEM’ OF THIS DAY. The commentators<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">389</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R’dak in his Sefer Hashorashim, (Book or Roots), root <i>etzem</i>.</i> have said that the meaning of this phrase is “in this selfsame day.” Similarly, <i>and ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor fresh ears until ‘etzem’ this day</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">390</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 14.</i> means “until this selfsame day.” So also, <i>‘uch’etzem’ the heaven for clearness</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">391</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 24:10.</i> means “the very” heaven. But we cannot interpret that the word <i>b’etzem</i> here alludes to the essence and power of this day<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">392</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And in that case the verse would be stating: “You shall do no manner of work in the essence of the day, meaning at daytime.” That interpretation would be incorrect, as the text continues.</i> [which is at daytime], just as our Rabbis have said with reference to the verses: <i>‘b’etzem’ of this day entered Noah</i> … <i>into the ark</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">393</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 7:13.</i> [which the Rabbis interpreted to mean<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">394</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifre, <i>Ha’azinu</i> 332.</i> that because the neighbors threatened to kill him and destroy the ark should they see him entering it, therefore G-d told him to enter it <i>‘b’etzem’ of this day</i> — in broad daylight]; <i>‘b’etzem’ of this day the Eternal did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">395</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 12:51.</i> [which the Rabbis similarly interpreted<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">394</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifre, <i>Ha’azinu</i> 332.</i> “in broad daylight,” because of the previous threats of the Egyptians not to let them go — such an interpretation we cannot assume here], for it is written, <i>and ye shall afflict your souls, in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">396</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 32. Thus it is clear that the prohibitions affecting the Day of Atonement commence on the evening before the actual day.</i> Similarly, <i>And ye shall make proclamation ‘b’etzem’ of this day a holy assembly</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">397</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 21.</i> [stated with reference to the Festival of Weeks] includes the night as well. Now He did not mention this phrase <i>‘b’etzem’ of this day</i> with reference to the Sabbath nor the festivals, except for the Festival of Weeks and the Day of Atonement, and so also in the prohibition of <i>chadash</i> (the new produce)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">285</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When the Sanctuary stood, the offering of the <i>omer</i> at any time on the sixteenth day of Nisan at once rendered <i>chadash</i> (the new crop) permissible food. Since the destruction of the Sanctuary, the prohibition extends to the whole day of the sixteenth of Nisan (Rosh Hashanah 30 a-b; see also “The Commandments,” Vol. II, pp. 186-188).</i> He said <i>until ‘etzem’ of this day</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">390</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 14.</i> The reason for this appears to be that since He had said of the Festival of Weeks, <i>from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the waving</i> … <i>ye shall number fifty days</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">398</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 15-16. Thus one might think that the observance of the festival depends on the doing of the acts prescribed for it, whereas the real meaning is: “from the <i>day</i> that you are to bring” etc. irrespective of whether they can be brought or not, as when the Temple is destroyed.</i> and then He stated, <i>and ye shall present a new meal-offering … Ye shall bring out of your dwellings</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">399</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 16-17.</i> etc., and dealt at length with the commandments of the offerings [in Verses 17-20], therefore it was necessary to state, <i>And ye shall make proclamation ‘b’etzem’ of this day a solemn assembly;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">397</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 21.</i> meaning that the very day is holy and the doing of work is forbidden on it, and it is not dependent upon the sheaf [of the waving brought on the second day of Passover], nor on the offerings. Similarly in the case of the Day of Atonement, since He had said, <i>and ye shall afflict your souls, and ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the Eternal</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">400</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 27.</i> and in the section of <i>Acharei Moth</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">401</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Chapter 16.</i> He made the [complete] expiation dependent upon the offerings and on the goat sent [to Azazel],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">402</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 22.</i> therefore it was necessary to state here, <i>And ye shall do no manner of work</i> on that very day, <i>for it is a day of atonement</i> in itself <i>to make atonement for you</i>, besides the expiation effected by the offerings. Similarly, <i>until ‘etzem’ of this day</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">390</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 14.</i> said in connection with the new produce [means that the prohibition of eating from the new produce continues] up to that very day, which is the day <i>ye have brought the offering of your G-d</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">390</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 14.</i> thus stating that even if the [meal-] offering [of the new barley] has not been brought, the commandment applies to that very day — so that the new produce<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">285</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When the Sanctuary stood, the offering of the <i>omer</i> at any time on the sixteenth day of Nisan at once rendered <i>chadash</i> (the new crop) permissible food. Since the destruction of the Sanctuary, the prohibition extends to the whole day of the sixteenth of Nisan (Rosh Hashanah 30 a-b; see also “The Commandments,” Vol. II, pp. 186-188).</i> is forbidden before that day and is permissible afterwards. This is the sense of His saying, <i>it is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">390</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 14.</i> as I have explained.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">403</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 16.</i><br>We further find that Scripture mentions this phrase <i>‘b’etzem’ of this day</i> in the case of events which have been decreed to come at certain set times. Thus it says of Noah, <i>‘b’etzem’ of this day entered Noah</i> etc.;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">393</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 7:13.</i> [and in case of the exodus it says,] <i>And it came to pass ‘b’etzem’ of this day that all the hosts of the Eternal went out from the land of Egypt;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">404</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 12:41.</i> [and when Moses was ordered to ascend Mount Nebo it says,] <i>And the Eternal spoke unto Moses ‘b’etzem’ of that day, saying: ‘Get thee up into this mountain of Abarim, unto Mount Nebo.’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">405</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 32:48.</i> The reason for this expression in these [three] cases is that it is possible to think that Noah had brought into the ark beforehand many of the beasts and fowls [and on the selfsame day that <i>he finished</i> bringing them into the ark, he himself came in]; likewise it is possible [to think] that some Israelites had left Egypt before that time and on that day the exodus was completed, and so also that the command for Moses our teacher’s ascension was given before that day, and on that day he actually went up. Therefore Scripture explained in all these [three] cases that [the particular events referred to in the verses] all took place on these selfsame days, not that they were started before and finished on those days, but they all happened [completely] on these very days. Similarly, <i>‘b’etzem’ of this day was Abraham circumcised</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">406</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 17:26.</i> means that many people were circumcised in one day, the verse thus stating Abraham’s zeal in observing the commandments.<br>It further appears to me that the expression “the <i>etzem</i>” of any thing means “its power and strength,” the term being derived from the verses: <i>my power ‘v’otzem’</i> (<i>and the might</i>) <i>of my hand;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">407</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 8:17.</i> <i>strength ‘v’tha’atzumoth’</i> (<i>and power</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">408</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 68:36.</i> So also, <i>One dieth ‘b’etzem tumo’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">409</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 21:23.</i> means “in <i>the</i> fulness of <i>his</i> strength.” And since the bones form the structure of the body and its strength, they are so called [<i>atzamoth —</i> from the word <i>otzem</i>, strength]. Thus <i>‘k’etzem’ the heaven for clearness</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">391</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 24:10.</i> means that the purity of that which they saw [at Mount Sinai] was clear and strong, even as is a pure clear heaven. It is for this reason that He mentions about those specific days [of festivals referred to above] the expression <i>etzem hayom</i>, in order to indicate that these matters specified are of the very essence of the days, not because of other things added to them, namely the offerings brought on those days.<br>And so also did Onkelos translate [the word <i>etzem</i> as] “<i>bikran</i> of that day,” which [literally] means “‘in the horn’ of that day,” [i.e.,] in its essence and in its strength, the word <i>bikran</i> being related to these expressions: <i>and all ‘karnei’</i> (<i>the horns</i>) <i>of the wicked will I cut off;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">410</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 75:11.</i> <i>my shield ‘v’keren’</i> (<i>and the horn of</i>) <i>my salvation;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">411</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Samuel 22:3.</i> for since the strength [of the animal] is in its horns, therefore the substance of a thing is called <i>karno</i> [“its horn” — its strength or essence]. In the language of the Sages we find:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">412</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Terumoth 7:1.</i> “He pays the <i>keren</i> (the principal value) but he does not pay the [added] fifth.” And some texts of Onkelos have <i>bichran</i> [with a <i>chaph</i> instead of <i>bikran</i> with a <i>kuph</i>], but it is all one, for in Scripture <i>kova</i> and <i>chova</i> both mean hat,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">413</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 17:38 (<i>kova</i>); 17:5 (<i>chova</i>). See Vol. I, p. 506, where Ramban mentions this princuple briefly, that the <i>kuph</i> and the <i>kaph</i> (or <i>chaph</i>) are often interchangeable.</i> and the Sages always make use of the term <i>akava</i> written with a <i>kaph</i> [meaning “staying”], which is derived from the expression, <i>‘v’lo y’akveim’</i> [written with a <i>kuph</i>, and meaning: <i>and He stayeth them not</i>] <i>when His voice is heard</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">414</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 37:4.</i> The Rabbis also say <i>mithkasheit</i> [with a <i>kuph</i>]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">415</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tosephta, Kethuboth 7:3. See my Hebrew commentary p. 156, Note 73.</i> from the word <i>tachshitin</i> [with a <i>chaph</i>, meaning “ornaments”]. They further say: “If ants <i>kors’muha</i>” [with a <i>kuph</i>, meaning “nibbled” the crop],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">416</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Peah 2:7.</i> of the root: <i>the boar out of the wood ‘y’chars’menah’</i> [with a <i>chaph</i>, meaning: <i>doth ravage it</i>].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">417</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 80:14.</i> And those other places where the expression <i>‘b’etzem’ of this day</i> is mentioned also mean: “in the strength of that day,” for they were matters which in the normal course of events could not happen in one day. Therefore Scripture stated that all the beasts and all the cattle and all the fowl and all creeping things upon the earth were gathered by “the power” of that day, by the decree of G-d upon them, for <i>it was</i> His <i>mouth that commanded and the breath thereof it hath gathered them</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">418</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 34:16.</i> Similarly, <i>six hundred thousand men on foot, beside children</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">419</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 12:37.</i> cannot be gathered together and go out as one man from the land of Egypt [all in one day], only by the strength of the day which was so decreed upon it by word of the Supreme One. And so also in the case of Moses our teacher, this expression [<i>‘b’etzem’ of this day</i>] is intended to teach that on the day he was commanded to write this song, <i>and teach it the children of Israel, put it in their mouths</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">420</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 31:19.</i> <i>and he finished speaking all these words</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">421</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 32:45.</i> it was decreed upon him that he go up by the power of that day in which the Divine decree was given, to Mount Abarim, and then he said the section of <i>‘V’zoth Habrachah’</i> (<i>And this is the blessing</i>)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">422</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Chapter 33.</i> and afterwards he went up to the mountain — all these activities being matters which would usually take many days, but they were all done by the power and strength of the day. Similarly, that three hundred and twenty men<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">423</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Three hundred and eighteen were the trained men in the house of Abraham (Genesis 14:14). Together with Abraham and Ishmael there are three hundred and twenty.</i> should be circumcised in one day in the house of Abraham was a thing that proceeded from G-d. Now the prophet Ezekiel said, <i>they and their fathers have transgressed against Me, to ‘etzem’ this day</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">424</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 2:3.</i> in order to include that very day in this group. So also the expression <i>until ‘etzem’ of this day</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">390</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 14.</i> of the prohibition of the new produce, means “until and inclusive of this day” [i.e., on the sixteenth of Nisan it is also forbidden to eat of the new produce, before the bringing of the meal-offering of the new barley], for the essence of a thing is its power and strength.<br>And our Rabbis have interpreted the expression <i>‘b’etzem’ of this day</i> used in connection with the festivals, to mean<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">425</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 14:7.</i> “on the day itself,” that is to say, from the time the stars appear until they come out on the following night, thus excluding the additional time which the Sages have deduced must be added from profane unto holy [i.e., before the actual beginning of the festival, and after its actual end]. And in the cases of Noah, and the exodus from Egypt, and Moses’ [death], they interpreted that phrase to mean “in the strength of the day,” [that is] mid-day, as is stated in the Sifre,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">394</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifre, <i>Ha’azinu</i> 332.</i> and Rashi wrote it in the section of <i>Ha’azinu</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">405</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 32:48.</i>"

                    "WHEN YE HAVE GATHERED IN THE INCREASE OF THE LAND. “[This is to state] that this seventh month [in which the Festival of Tabernacles occurs] must be at the time of the harvest. From here we learn that they were commanded to intercalate the years [with an extra month], because if there would be no such intercalation, the seventh month [i.e., Tishri] would sometimes fall in the middle of the summer, or in the winter.” This is Rashi’s language. And the words of the Torath Kohanim are as follows:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">440</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 15:6-7.</i> “Intercalate the years so that you make the Festival of Tabernacles at the time of the ingathering of the fruits.

Now if I am to follow the expression <i>after thou hast gathered in ‘from’ thy threshing-floor</i>, I might think that even if only a little [of it has been gathered in, the Festival of Tabernacles may already be observed in that part of the year, and there is no need then for intercalating an extra month at the end of the preceding winter]; Scripture therefore says [here], <i>when ye have gathered in the produce of the land</i>. How can these be reconciled? [In the following manner]: Try to intercalate the year so that the Festival of Tabernacles occurs when most of the fruits have already been gathered in.” Now the Sages have already derived [the need for] intercalating the year from the verse <i>Observe the month of ‘aviv’</i> (<i>spring</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">442</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 16:1. This teaches that before it comes you are to watch whether that month will be capable of producing <i>aviv</i> (ripe ears), and if not, intercalate a year [by adding a month to the winter period] (Rashi <i>ibid.</i>, on the basis of Sanhedrin 11 a).</i> But there Scripture taught about [the intercalation of the year because of] the spring [i.e., so that the celebration of the exodus occurs in the month when there are ripe ears already, so that the sheaf of waving can be brought on the sixteenth of Nisan from the new barley], and here it teaches concerning the fruits of the trees [that most of them must be ripened at the time of the Festival of Weeks, so that they are ready to be brought as first-fruits to the Sanctuary, and that most of them are to be gathered in before the Festival of Tabernacles]. For so did the Sages teach us:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">443</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 11 b.</i> “The year is intercalated on account of three things: on account of ripe ears [that they be available at the time of Passover], fruits of the trees [at the time of the Festival of Weeks], and on account of the solstice [that the summer solstice should not occur after the passing of Tabernacles].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">444</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi, <i>ibid.</i></i> Thus the need for intercalation is deduced automatically [from the statement] that this festival [of Tabernacles] is at the time of the ingathering [and if an extra month is not added at the end of the winter season, the festival might sometimes occur in the middle of the summer or winter].<br>The meaning, however, of the Scriptural verse here is as follows: It states, <i>These are the appointed seasons of the Eternal</i> all of <i>which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to bring</i> on all of them <i>an offering made by fire unto the Eternal</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">445</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 37.</i> However, <i>on the fifteenth day of this seventh month</i>, because it is the time when you have gathered in the increase of the land, <i>ye shall keep the feast of the Eternal seven days</i>. He said here in addition, <i>on the first day shall be ‘shabbathon’ and on the eighth day shall be ‘shabbathon,’</i> meaning that you are to desist from work, and to rest on them, as I have explained.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">446</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 24.</i> And He further said that they should rejoice even more before G-d with the <i>lulav</i> and <i>ethrog</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">447</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 40.</i> for seven days, for it is a time of rejoicing because G-d has blessed you <i>in all thine increase, and in all the work of thy hands, and thou shalt be altogether joyful</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">448</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 16:15.</i> before Him. The meaning of the phrase [in the verse before us] <i>ye shall keep the feast of the Eternal</i>, is that you are to celebrate it before Him by giving thanks to His Name for your gathering of the harvest which came [in time]. Then He went back and stated again [further on in Verse 41], <i>And ye shall keep it a feast unto the Eternal</i>, in order to place next to it [the commandment], <i>Ye shall dwell in booths</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">449</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 42.</i> the meaning thereof being as follows: <i>and ye shall keep it a feast seven days</i> in the year by dwelling in booths, <i>and all that are home-born shall dwell</i> in them, thus stating that they shall make a festival of seven days by taking the <i>lulav</i>, and rejoicing before G-d, and dwelling in booths.

                    "AND YE SHALL TAKE YOU ON THE FIRST DAY ‘PRI EITZ HADAR’ (THE FRUIT OF GOODLY TREES). “[That is, a tree] whose bark has the same taste as its fruit. <i>Hadar</i> [a fruit] that ‘remains’ on its tree from one year to another, and this is the <i>ethrog</i>.” This is Rashi’s language. But these interpretations are merely Scriptural supports which our Rabbis taught<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">453</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Succah 35 a.</i> as a basis for their tradition [that the reference here is to the <i>ethrog</i>]. And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote: “And they [i.e., the masters of tradition] have said the truth [that <i>pri eitz hadar</i> refers to the <i>ethrog</i>], for there is no fruit of the tree more beautiful (<i>hadar</i>) than the <i>ethrog</i>. The Rabbis’ interpreted that <i>hadar</i> means [the fruit] that ‘remains’ on its tree [from one year to another], but this is merely a Scriptural support for a matter of tradition.”<br>The correct interpretation appears to me to be that the tree which is called in the Aramaic language <i>ethrog</i>, is called in the Sacred Tongue <i>hadar</i>, for the meaning of the word <i>ethrog</i> is “desirable,” as [Onkelos] rendered: <i>‘nechmad’</i> (<i>pleasant</i>) <i>to the sight</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">454</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 2:9.</i> —” <i>dimrageig</i> to see; “<i>‘lo thachmod’</i> (<i>Thou shalt not covet</i>)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">455</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 20:14.</i> — “thou shalt not <i>theirog</i>.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">456</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In our version of Onkelos <i>lo theirog</i> is given as the translation of the Hebrew <i>‘lo thithaveh’</i> (<i>Thou shalt not desire</i>) — in Deuteronomy 5:18. In Exodus 20:14, the Aramaic is the same as the Hebrew: <i>lo thachameid</i>. — The general point, however, is clearly established, that the term <i>theirog</i> means “desire,” “delight” or “pleasant.” The name <i>ethrog</i> is related to this expression.</i> And we also say:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">457</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The source of the expression is found in Targum Jonathan to Psalms 45:14. From Ramban’s words “we say,” it would seem that he is referring to that phrase written in the marriage contract wherein the husband undertakes to pay to his wife a certain sum of money “from all the best, most desirable of his belongings.”</i> “from all the best, <i>arag</i> (most desirable) properties.” And the terms <i>hadar</i> and <i>chemdah</i> are alike in meaning [“desirable”]. Thus the tree and the fruit [<i>ethrog</i>] are both called by one name [as <i>hadar</i> in Aramaic is <i>ethrog</i>], for such is the customary usage of names for most fruits: <i>t’einah</i> [denotes both the fig tree and the fruit]; <i>egoz</i> (nut); <i>rimon</i> (pomegranate); <i>zayith</i> (olive) and other fruits [in all of which cases both the tree and its fruit have the same name], and similarly this tree and fruit are both called in Aramaic <i>ethrog</i>, and in the Sacred Tongue they are called <i>hadar</i>.<br>In line with the plain meaning of Scripture the verse is stating that we should take for ourselves a <i>pri eitz hadar</i> [“the fruit of a tree called <i>hadar</i>” in Hebrew, which is called <i>ethrog</i> in Aramaic], and that we take <i>branches of palm-trees</i>, and one <i>bough of thick trees</i> [known as <i>hadas</i>, the myrtle], and one bough of <i>the willows of the brook</i> [known as <i>aravah</i>]. Thus [we are to take] one of each of the [four] species, for the [plural] expression <i>branches of palm-trees</i> is connected with <i>And ye shall take you</i>, which refers to many people [so that each person is to take only one of these branches],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">458</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, since the Rabbis have interpreted the phrase <i>and ye shall take you</i> as meaning that the taking of the four species is to be done by each person, therefore Onkelos translated it: “and you [all] shall take <i>ethrogin, lulavin</i> etc. [in the plural] since the Torah is speaking here to all individuals together. Hence even though it is written <i>branches of palm-trees</i> in the plural, yet we only have to take one branch of a palm-tree, the plural being used because the phrase is connected with <i>and ye shall take you</i>, which refers to many people.</i> since the final decision of the law is like Rabbi Akiba<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">459</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Succah 34 b. See, however, at the very end of this discussion for the practice today.</i> who says: “Just as only one palm-branch is needed and only one <i>ethrog</i>, so also [we need only] one myrtle-branch and one willow-branch.” Therefore Onkelos translated all these four species in the plural [<i>ethrogin, lulavin</i>, etc.], since they are all connected with the [preceding] phrase <i>And ye shall take you</i>, which refers to many people.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">458</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, since the Rabbis have interpreted the phrase <i>and ye shall take you</i> as meaning that the taking of the four species is to be done by each person, therefore Onkelos translated it: “and you [all] shall take <i>ethrogin, lulavin</i> etc. [in the plural] since the Torah is speaking here to all individuals together. Hence even though it is written <i>branches of palm-trees</i> in the plural, yet we only have to take one branch of a palm-tree, the plural being used because the phrase is connected with <i>and ye shall take you</i>, which refers to many people.</i> And in [explanation of] the reason for this commandment, by way of homiletic discourse, the Rabbis have said that these [four] species are used to obtain the favor of G-d that He may give water.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">460</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Taanith 2 b.</i><br>And by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], <i>‘pri eitz hadar’</i> (<i>the fruit of the goodly tree</i>) is the fruit in which there is a great deal of desire, and the first man sinned with it, as it is said, <i>And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">461</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 3:6.</i> Thus the sin consisted [of taking the <i>ethrog</i>] alone,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">462</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Beiur Ha ‘lvush</i> in his commentary to Ricanti who quotes the language of Ramban.</i> and we obtain His favor [by means of the <i>ethrog</i>] together with the other species …<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">463</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To couple the tent together, that it may be one (Abusaula).</i> From here you will understand and know that the <i>ethrog</i> is not bound up with the other three species, and yet it invalidates [the performance of the commandment] if it is not taken together with them, for it is comparable to <i>Atzereth</i> (the eighth day of Tabernacles)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">464</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 36.</i> which is a festival of its own, and yet is supplementary to the first days.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">436</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus: “He that made no offerings on the first festival day of Tabernacles, must offer them any day throughout the whole festival, even on the last [i.e., the eighth] day of Tabernacles” (Chagigah 9 a).

Ramban is now to differ with this opinion, and holds that since Abraham entered the covenant, he and his seed already enjoyed that status later defined as that of Israelites, and under such law the son of the Israelite woman assumed her status, and hence there was no need for his official conversion. The statement of the Torath Kohanim that he was converted must mean only, as explained above, that he was reared by his mother and he became attached to Israel.</i> But such is not my opinion, for since the time that Abraham entered into the covenant [with G-d], they [i.e., his descendants through Isaac and Jacob] were Israelites <i>and were not to be reckoned among the nations</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">536</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 23:9.</i> just as the Rabbis have said with respect to Esau:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">537</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kiddushin 18 a.</i> “Perhaps the case of an Israelite who is an apostate is different!” [Thus the Rabbis referred to Esau, who was long before the Giving of the Torah on Sinai, as an “Israelite.”] And is it not an argument from minor to major! “If after the Giving of the Torah when a Cuthean has sexual relations with a daughter of Abraham, and he is forbidden to her by a negative commandment and his betrothal to her is not valid, yet she is the source of purification of the nations, so that her child becomes fully-qualified and of her own standing — does it not follow all the more so that before the Torah was given, she purifies her child to be of her own standing, so that circumcision be incumbent upon him as upon the seed of Abraham, and that he be part of the community of the children of Israel!”"

Were not all the commandments declared on Sinai? [It is to teach us that] just as [this law of] the Sabbatical year was ordained on Sinai with its general rules, its specific prescripts and its minute details, so also were all [the commandments] ordained on Sinai with their general rules, and their specific prescripts and their minute details. Thus it is taught [here] in the Torath Kohanin. It appears to me<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e. Rashi. Having quoted the text of the Torath Kohanim, Rashi now proceeds to explain the basis of the analogy of this text of the Beraitha between our section and all other commandments. To follow Rashi’s answer it is important to recall that in the final year of Israel’s stay in the wilderness, when they were encamped <i>in the plains of Moab</i> (Numbers 22:1), Moses, in the last days of his life, restated the commandments of G-d, his words being contained in the Book of Deuteronomy. However, since not all the commandments were restated there by Moses, our verse serves as a basis for the interpretation of the Torath Kohanim, as will be explained by Rashi. Ramban will differ with this whole approach, since the text of the Torath Kohanim makes no reference at all to Moses’ restatement of the laws in the plains of Moab. See at end of Note 10.</i> that the following is the interpretation thereof: Since we do not find the law of the resting of the soil [in the Sabbatical year] repeated in the plains of Moab [when Moses restated the law, as contained in the Book of Deuteronomy], we must deduce that all the general rules and specific prescripts [of the Sabbatical year, including those of the resting of the soil] were declared on Sinai. [Why then was it necessary for Scripture to state here <i>in Mount Sinai</i>, since it is self-understood that this entire law was promulgated on Sinai, since the law of the resting of the soil is not mentioned in the Book of Deuteronomy? We must say that the reason] Scripture mentioned [the phrase <i>in Mount Sinai</i>] here is in order to teach that every communication [i.e., commandment] that was spoken to Moses on Sinai, was given at Sinai together with its general rules and minute details, and they were [merely] repeated and taught again in the plains of Moab.” Thus far is the language of Rashi.<br>But this does not appear to me to be correct at all. For there are many commandments like the Sabbatical year which were not repeated in the plains of Moab, and [all] we know about their general rules and specific prescripts is that they were promulgated either on Sinai or in the Tent of Meeting [but not specifically on Sinai, as Rashi said]!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, we can be certain that those commandments which were not mentioned <i>in the plains of Moab</i> [and are recorded in other parts of the Torah], were declared at some preceding time, but we cannot be sure whether they were said with the commandments given at Sinai, or only later on, after the building of the Tabernacle from which G-d communicated to Moses. On what basis, then, does Rashi say that they were all given on Sinai?</i> Moreover, how do we know that the other commandments which were repeated in the plains of Moab are to be likened to the Sabbatical year [which was not repeated? Perhaps this analogy applies only to those commandments which were <i>not</i> repeated in the plains of Moab, like the Sabbatical year; but how do we know that the analogy applies also to those that <i>were</i> repeated by Moses in the plains of Moab, as contained in the Book of Deuteronomy? And how do we know that in the case of those commandments that <i>were</i> repeated by Moses], that only the general rules were declared on Sinai but the specific prescripts were given in the plains of Moab! And indeed it would be more logical to say so, that those commandments which were repeated by Moses, were restated for the sake of explaining their specific prescripts, since on Sinai only their general rules had been declared!<br>But the interpretation of the above Beraitha is clear: The general rules of the Sabbatical year were declared on Sinai, as it is written in the section of <i>‘V’eileh Hamishpatim’</i> (<i>And these are the ordinances</i>):<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 21:1. Since these ordinances were declared before the Tabernacle was erected, they must perforce have been given on Sinai.</i> <i>And on the seventh year thou shalt let it</i> [i.e., the Land] <i>rest and lie fallow, that the poor of thy people may eat</i> etc.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 23:11.</i> These are the laws of the Sabbatical year in a general way. Here He went back [to this subject] and said that <i>in Mount Sinai</i> all its specific prescripts were also given, since all of them are mentioned in this section. And at the end of this subject it is written, <i>These are the commandments, which the Eternal commanded Moses for the children of Israel in Mount Sinai</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 27:34.</i> in order to liken all the commandments to the Sabbatical year [previously] mentioned, [teaching] that all of them, likewise, were stated in general terms and with their particular details — that is, all were declared on Sinai. And thus it is taught there in the Torath Kohanim:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, end of <i>Seder Bechukothai</i>.</i> “<i>These are the commandments</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 27:34.</i> Henceforth no prophet may promulgate any new thing.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a major teaching in Judaism, that the prophets who came after Moses only served to exhort Israel to obey the laws given by Moses, but no new Divine commandments were added.</i> <i>Which the Eternal commanded Moses</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 27:34.</i> The messenger was [found] deserving before Him Who sent him [since he was the most perfect of all human beings].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Malbim to Torath Kohanim <i>ibid.</i></i> <i>Moses for the children of Israel</i>. It was the merit of Israel that caused [the Divine Glory to rest upon Moses].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“And that the Torah be given through Moses. For if Israel had not accepted the Torah, the Divine Glory would not have communicated with Moses, because where there is no flock there is no shepherd, and if there is a flock there must be a shepherd” (Rabad in his commentary to Torath Kohanim, <i>ibid.</i>).</i> <i>In Mount Sinai</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 27:34.</i> [this teaches] that all commandments originated at Sinai.” Thus far is the text in the Torath Kohanim. But the reason [that the laws were repeated] in the plains of Moab was only for the purpose of explaining the Torah to the children [of those who had left Egypt, who were born in the wilderness after the Giving of the Torah at Sinai]. This appears to me to be the interpretation [of the Beraitha of the Torath Kohanim mentioned] and “it is well and nicely said.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew expression <i>kaftor vaferach</i> literally means “a knop and a flower.” The term is borrowed from the design of the candelabrum (see Exodus 25:33), and here means “a thing of truth, and beautifully stated.” The usage of this expression is found in Bereshith Rabbah 91:12. It has been suggested that since the candelabrum in the Tabernacle represented the light of wisdom, the knops and flowers in the candelabrum symbolized truth beautifully expressed. Hence the expression <i>kaftor vaferach</i> as applied to a dictum of truth well formulated. — In essence, Ramban’s understanding of the Beraitha mentioned by Rashi is as follows: “Why is the expression <i>in Mount Sinai</i> mentioned here? It cannot be to teach us that the <i>general principles</i> of the Sabbatical year were given on Sinai, for all commandments were declared on Sinai in general terms, the Sabbatical year being merely one of them, as expressly stated in Exodus 23:11. Hence the expression here <i>in Mount Sinai</i> must be to teach that all its specific prescripts were also given on Mount Sinai, and from this you may deduce that the verse at the end of the Book of Leviticus, which states, <i>These are the commandments which the Eternal commanded Moses … in Mount Sinai</i> intends to teach us that the specific prescripts of <i>all</i> the laws were also declared on Sinai. — Ramban’s interpretation is thus not based at all on Moses’ restatement of the laws in the plains of Moab, as is that of Rashi, but instead is founded upon the verses in Exodus 23:11, and at the end of Leviticus, as explained.</i><br>Now the reason why this section [of the laws of the Sabbatical year] was written here, Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra explained to be as follows: This is the covenant which was written in the section of <i>‘V’eileh Hamishpatim’</i> (<i>And these are the ordinances</i>),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 24:4-7: <i>And Moses wrote all the words of the Eternal … And he took the Book of the Covenant</i>.</i> and when the people accepted it upon themselves [by saying] <i>we will do, and obey</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 7.</i> then the covenant was made,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 8.</i> and [Moses] told them this whole section [containing the laws of the Sabbatical year]. Scripture mentioned it in this place in order to put in proximity all the conditions [He laid down for Israel’s inheriting] the Land; for just as He said with reference to forbidden sexual relations that on account of them the Land will vomit them out,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 18:28.</i> so He said in the section of <i>‘Im Bechukothai’</i> (<i>If ye walk in My statutes</i>)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 26:3.</i> with regard to [not keeping the laws of] the Sabbaths of the Land,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 34.</i> and therefore it was necessary that He mention [here] first [what are the laws of] the Sabbatical years.<br>In my opinion this section is written here in its proper order, for the expression <i>in Mount Sinai</i> means when Moses went up there to receive the <i>second</i> Tablets [and does not refer, as Ibn Ezra interprets it, to the time immediately after the Giving of the Torah, even before Moses went up the mountain to receive the <i>first</i> Tablets of the Law], and the explanation of the matter is as follows: At the beginning of the first forty days of the first Tablets, Moses wrote in the Book of the Covenant <i>all the words of the Eternal</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 24:4.</i> and all the ordinances stated there [in that section],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Chapters 21-23.</i> and he sprinkled the blood of the covenant upon the people.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 8.</i> But when the people sinned with the [golden] calf and the Tablets were broken, that was equivalent to a breaking of the covenant with the Holy One, blessed be He. Therefore when the Holy One, blessed be He, became reconciled to Moses by giving him the second Tablets, He commanded him concerning a new covenant, as it is said, <i>Behold, I make a covenant;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 34:10.</i> and He repeated there the stringent commandments that had been said in the section of <i>‘V’eileh Hamishpatim’</i> (<i>And these are the ordinances</i>)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 21:1.</i> at the first covenant, and He [now] stated, <i>Write thou these words, for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 34:27.</i> Now the Holy One, blessed be He, wanted to make this second covenant with them with greater stringency, and that it should be upon them by means of oaths and curses, and that it should cover, like the first one, all the original commandments and all the ordinances, as it is said of the first covenant, <i>And Moses came and told the people all the words of the Eternal, and all the ordinances</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 24:3.</i> Therefore Scripture states here at the end of the exhortations, <i>These are the statutes and ordinances and laws, which the Eternal made between Him and the children of Israel, in Mount Sinai by the hand of Moses</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 26:46.</i> this being an allusion to all the commandments and ordinances which had been said at the first covenant, in the section of <i>‘V’eileh Hamishpatim’</i> (<i>And these are the ordinances</i>),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 21:1.</i> for they were all embodied in this [second] covenant.<br>Now in the Book of the first Covenant, the law of the Sabbatical year was stated in a general way as I have mentioned, as it is said, <i>And on the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie fallow</i> etc.,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 23:11.</i> and now in this second convenant it was said with its specific prescripts, its minute details, and its penalties. At the time of the first covenant, during the first forty days [after the Giving of the Torah, when Moses went up to the mountain], Moses was commanded concerning the building of the Tabernacle; and when the Holy One, blessed be He, became reconciled to him and commanded him to make a second covenant for them, Moses came down [from the mountain] <i>and he gave them in commandment all that the Eternal had spoken with him in Mount Sinai</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 34:32.</i> including the making of the Tabernacle. Then <i>Moses assembled all the congregation of the children of Israel, and said unto them</i> as at first, <i>These are the words which the Eternal hath commanded that ye should do them</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 35:1.</i> when making the Tabernacle. Now they accepted the charge joyfully, and departed from his presence at once, and they all came back and brought the donations, and made the Tabernacle and completed its construction. And as soon as it was set up, <i>He</i> immediately <i>called unto Moses, and the Eternal spoke unto him out of the Tent of Meeting</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 1:1.</i> and He commanded him regarding the offerings and the whole <i>Torath Kohanim</i> [“law of the priests,” i.e., the Book of Leviticus], and Moses immediately commanded them all to Aaron and his sons and to all the children of Israel. When he had finished, he said to them: “G-d further commanded me in Mount Sinai to explain to you [the laws of] the Sabbatical year and of the Jubilee, and to make a new covenant with you concerning all the commandments and ordinances, by means of adjuration and oath.” It was not necessary now [for Moses] to slaughter offerings and sprinkle half of the blood upon the people and half upon the altar, as he had done at the first covenant,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 24:5-6.</i> because now they were [again] accepting upon themselves the original covenant, with these oaths and adjurations. This is the sense of the expression, <i>which the Eternal made between Him and the children of Israel in Mount Sinai</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 26:46.</i> for it was He Who made with them this [second] covenant, having forgiven them on the basis of these conditions [i.e., the oaths and adjurations mentioned further on in Chapter 26], as I have explained at the end of [<i>Seder</i>] <i>Ki Thisa</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 34:27; 31.

But the intent thereof is not as Rashi presented it, for etc. The full text of the Beraitha of the Torath Kohanim will be mentioned further on by Ramban.</i> for all [weekly] Sabbaths, and also the festivals, are in honor of the Eternal, and yet in not one of them [i.e., the festivals] does Scripture say that they are “unto the Eternal.” Instead, it says <i>it shall be a solemn rest unto you</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 23:24.</i> and in the case of the Day of Atonement it states, <i>It shall be unto you a Sabbath of solemn rest</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 32.</i> The text of the Beraitha in the Torah Kohanim [quoted by Rashi] is as follows:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Behar</i> 1:2.</i> “<i>A Sabbath unto the Eternal</i>. Just as it says with reference to the Sabbath of Creation, so is it said regarding the Sabbatical year, <i>a Sabbath unto the Eternal</i>.” But the meaning of <i>a Sabbath unto the Eternal thy G-d</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 20:10.

I have already written in <i>Seder Bereshith</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 2:3 (Vol. I, pp. 61-64).</i> that the six days of creation represent [all] the days of the world, <i>and the seventh day is a Sabbath unto the Eternal thy G-d</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 20:10. See note above.</i> for on it will be the Sabbath to the Great Name, just as we have been taught [in a Mishnah]:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tamid 7:4.</i> “On the seventh day what psalm did the Levites sing [in the Sanctuary? They sang] <i>A Psalm, a Song. For the Sabbath-day</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 92:1.</i> — [a song] for the World to Come, which will be wholly a Sabbath, and rest for life everlasting.” Thus the [seven] days [of the week] allude to that which He created in the process of creation, and the [seven] years [of the Sabbatical cycle] refer to that which will occur during the creation of all “the days” of the world. It is for this reason that Scripture was more stringent regarding [the transgression of the laws of] the Sabbatical year than with respect to those guilty of transgressing all other negative commandments, and made it punishable with exile, just as He was stringent with respect to forbidden sexual relations [for which the punishment of the people, as opposed to that of the individual, is also exile];<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 18:28.</i> as it is said, <i>Then shall the Land be paid her Sabbaths</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 26:34.</i> and He repeated this matter many times: <i>As long as it lieth desolate it shall have rest</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 35.</i> and it is further said, <i>And the Land shall lie forsaken without them, and shall be paid her Sabbaths</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 43.</i> “And so we have been taught [in a Mishnah]:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Aboth 5:9. Our text of the Mishnah has a variant reading. See my Hebrew commentary p. 167, Note 55.</i> “Exile comes for the delaying of justice, and for the perversion of justice, and for [the neglect of] the year of rest for the Land.” [This stringency of punishment is] because whoever denies it [i.e., the law of the Sabbatical year], does not acknowledge the work of creation and [life in] the World to Come. Similarly the prophet [Jeremiah] was stringent, and decreed exile for neglecting to send [Hebrew] servants to freedom in the seventh year [of their service], as it is said, <i>I made a covenant with your fathers … At the beginning of seven years ye shall let go every man his brother</i> etc.,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 34:13-14. — The verse there reads <i>‘mikeitz sheva shanim’</i>, which is normally translated as “at the <i>end</i> of seven years” (so also in the J.P.S. translation). Ramban in Deuteronomy 15:1, however, brings proofs that the correct meaning in this context is “at the end-year of the seven years”, i.e., at the beginning of seventh year, rather than “at the end of the seventh year.” Thus the Hebrew servant goes free at the <i>beginning</i> of the seventh year [the <i>end-year</i> of the cycle of seven years], and this is indeed the accepted law (Rambam, <i>Hilchoth Avadim</i> 2:1) that he serves for six years. See, however, Yonathan ben Uziel in Jeremiah.</i> for in the case of a servant the seventh year is also like a [complete] Jubilee; and the Jubilee is known also [at the very beginning of the Torah] — from <i>‘Bereshith’</i> (<i>In the beginning</i>) to <i>‘Vayechulu’</i> (<i>And there were finished</i>)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, in the Scriptural account of the creation — commencing with the verse, <i>In the beginning</i> … and concluding with <i>‘Vayechulu’</i> (<i>And there were finished</i>) (2:1) — the secret of the Jubilee is already hinted at, namely, “that all things, that came into existence in the beginning of time will be finished in the era of the Jubilee (Beiur Ha’lvush to Ricanti who quotes the language of Ramban).</i> — intimating that in the Jubilee everything is to return [to its origin], <i>every man unto his possession, and every man unto his family</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 10.</i> For it is <i>a sure foundation</i>, and <i>he that believeth</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 28:16.

Ramban brings out ingeniously a different meaning by saying: he that believeth <i>‘yacharish’</i> (will keep silence), suggesting that the student of Cabala must be reticent and careful not to disclose the secrets he has learned. Cf. the phrase in Amos 5:13 — <i>‘Therefore ‘hamaskil yidom’</i>. (<i>he who understands will keep quiet</i>)!</i> shall keep silence.

                    "SIX YEARS THOU SHALT SOW THY FIELD.

But if the people do not do the will of G-d, they have to make four ‘years of rest’ of the soil in one seven-year cycle. How so? He plows for one year and cannot sow until the next year, again he plows for one year and cannot sow until the next year. Thus there are four ‘years of rest’ in one seven-year cycle.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The thought expressed is as follows: When Israel observes the law of the Sabbatical year G-d blesses the produce of the Land during the next six years. But if the law of the Torah is not observed, the farmer must leave his field fallow every alternate year in order to preserve the soil. Thus if the law of the Sabbatical year is observed, only one year of rest of the Land is required in a seven-year cycle, but where the law of the Torah is not observed, there must be four years of rest — the first, the third, the fifth, and the seventh. The meaning of the verse, according to this Mechilta [which is, as Ramban calls it here, “a homiletic exposition”], is thus: “six full years you will be able to sow your field without recourse to a rest of the Land, if in the seventh year there shall be a solemn rest for the Land” (Zeh Yenachameinu — a commentary upon the Mechilta).</i>"

[So why then did Scripture prohibit gathering the increase, since there can be none to gather without sowing?] Said Rabbi Akiba: It is from here that the Sages found a Scriptural source for <i>s’fichin</i> (aftergrowths), [indicating] that they are forbidden in the Sabbatical year.” This Beraitha is quoted in the Gemara [of Tractate Pesachim] in the Chapter <i>Makom Shenahagu</i> (“<i>A place where the custom is”</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">85</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Pesachim 51 b.</i> And it is further taught in the Torath Kohanim:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">84</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim. <i>Behar</i> 4:5.</i> “But the Sages say: Aftergrowths are not forbidden by law of the Torah, but only by decree of the Scribes. If so, why is it said, <i>behold, we may not sow, nor gather?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">83</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 20.</i> [It means as follows:] You have told us not to sow, and what there is for us to gather — [the aftergrowths] — we may not bring in for storage [after the time of the Removal];<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">86</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ramban further, Verse 7 for a full discussion of this law.</i> and then You have told us, ‘Remove it [from the house],’ what then shall we eat from the time of the Removal onwards?” Thus far [are the words of the Torath Kohanim].<br>Thus it is clear that according to the words of the Sages the prohibition of aftergrowths is only by law of the Rabbis, that is to say, it is they who decreed that they be prohibited altogether, because of the suspicion that the owners might sow and say that these are aftergrowths. It is for this reason that the Rabbis have said in the Yerushalmi:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">87</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yerushalmi, Baba Bathra V, 1. The translation follows the commentary of P’nei Moshe there.</i> “Rabbi Yannai said: All aftergrowths are forbidden [under the law forbidding theft, i.e., since they belong to the owner of the field, they may not be taken by a stranger during the non-Sabbatical years], except for those which come up in an uncultivated field, a plowed field, a field containing a vineyard, or a field sowed [with fenugreek]. [The aftergrowths of] an uncultivated field [are permissible to a stranger] because the owner pays no attention to such a field [and therefore it is considered ownerless]. A plowed field — the owner desires to clear of all growths. A field containing a vineyard — the owner does not want to forfeit his vineyard<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">88</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 22:9.</i> [because the aftergrowths of the grain in the vineyard constitute diverse kinds which are forbidden, and so he welcomes their being taken out by anyone]. A field sowed [with fenugreek] — the owner does not want to maintain aftergrowths therein [because they harm the fenugreek].”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">89</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, the aftergrowths of these four kinds of fields may be taken by anyone during all normal years, because the owners consider these growths ownerless; and in the Sabbatical year, since the owners are not suspected of having violated the law against planting them, they are permissible to the owners together with everyone else. But in all other fields, since the aftergrowths during any non-Sabbatical year are forbidden to be taken by strangers because the owners do not wish to relinquish their possession of them, in the Sabbatical year they are subject to the law of aftergrowths, as will be explained.</i><br>It is on the basis of this division of opinion [between Rabbi Akiba, who says that aftergrowths are forbidden in the Sabbatical year by law of the Torah, and the Sages, who are of the opinion that they are forbidden only by Rabbinical decree], that it is taught there in the Torath Kohanim:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">90</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Behar</i> 1:3.</i> “<i>That which groweth of itself of thy harvest thou shalt not reap</i>. It is from here that they found a Scriptural source for forbidding aftergrowths in the Sabbatical year.” They thus gave their teaching in accordance with the words of Rabbi Akiba, [who explains the phrase] <i>thou shalt not reap</i> as [prohibiting] altogether [any reaping, even of aftergrowths, by law of the Torah], But according to the words of the Sages [the verse means] that you are not to reap them [solely] for yourself, nor are you to gather the grapes [of your undressed vine solely] for yourself, but you are to treat them as if they were ownerless property. Similarly, <i>and we do not gather in our increase</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">83</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 20.</i> means that we do not gather [entirely] into our homes the fruits of the tree [which grow by themselves] nor the aftergrowths [of crops], because we must declare them ownerless for the poor, the beasts and the cattle, and at the time of Removal,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">86</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ramban further, Verse 7 for a full discussion of this law.</i> [and therefore one might say that] we are not able to live on them [since we cannot use them entirely as our own possession.]!<br>Now these aftergrowths which are forbidden according to Rabbi Akiba are those which have grown in the forbidden season. [i.e., the Sabbatical year]: in grain, all that has reached a third of its growth in the Sabbatical year, and in the case of vegetables, whatever has sprouted in the Sabbatical year are forbidden by law of the Torah. But according to the Sages they are forbidden by decree of the Scribes, except for those [aftergrowths] which come up in any of those [four kinds of] fields mentioned in the Yerushalmi<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">87</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yerushalmi, Baba Bathra V, 1. The translation follows the commentary of P’nei Moshe there.</i> which we have quoted above. However, vegetables that sprouted in the sixth year but were harvested in the seventh, are also subject to all the laws of the sanctity of the Sabbatical year [regarding Seventh year produce, which are as follows]: they must not be wasted [as they were given for food;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">81</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 6.</i> their money substitute may not be used] for [obligatory] offerings;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">91</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For if a person has an obligation to bring any offering, as for instance if he commits one of those sins for which he must bring a sin-offering, etc., he must discharge his duty from unhallowed money, and since the money-substitute of the Seventh-year produce is as sacred as the original produce, therefore this obligatory offering cannot be bought with this money.</i> [they may not be used] for the purpose of trade, and they are subject to the law of Removal.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">86</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ramban further, Verse 7 for a full discussion of this law.</i> For even though these vegetables grew completely in the sixth year [nonetheless if they were harvested in the seventh year, they are subject to the laws of the Sabbatical year], because we follow in the case of vegetables the time of collecting them in, whether for tithes<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">92</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the first and second years of the Sabbatical cycle, as well as in the fourth and fifth years, the First and Second Tithes are given of all produce, while in the third and sixth years, the First and the Poorman’s Tithes are given. The First Tithe is given to the Levite; the Second Tithe belongs to the owner, but he must eat it in Jerusalem. The Poorman’s Tithe is given to the poor, and they may eat it wherever they are. Now each group of produce has different rules to determine which is the relevant year for its specific tithes, since different factors apply; for instance: the fruits, crops and vegetables. The point here is that in the case of vegetables the determining factor is the time when they are gathered. Hence if, for example, the vegetables grew in the second year and were collected in the third, the tithes given are the First and Poorman’s Tithes. Similarly, if they grew in the sixth year and were collected in the seventh, the laws of the Sabbatical year apply to these vegetables, as specifically explained in the text.</i> or for the Sabbatical year. But the law of aftergrowths does not apply to them, for they are not aftergrowths of the Sabbatical year since they grew in the sixth year, and even if they continued [their growth] in the seventh year, the law of aftergrowths does not apply to them. It is with reference to such vegetables that we were taught [in the Mishnah]:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">93</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shevi’ith 8:4.</i> “If a man said to a laborer [in the Sabbatical year], ‘Here you have an <i>issar</i> [a coin equivalent to one twenty-fourth of the silver <i>dinar</i>], and gather me vegetables today’, his payment is permitted etc.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">94</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, the laborer is not restricted to buying only food, drink, or unguents with the money, as would have been the case if the money were subject to the laws of the sanctity of the Sabbatical year. “But if he said to him, ‘In return for it [i.e., the <i>issar</i>] gather me vegetables today,’ his payment is forbidden” [i.e., he is restricted to using the money only for the above-mentioned purposes]. The difference between these two cases is generally explained to be that the latter transaction resembles a sale [<i>in exchange</i> for the coin he gathers for him the vegetables], and it is forbidden to sell Seventh-year produce; therefore the money is “seized” with the sanctity of the original produce.</i> And similarly we were taught [there] in a Mishnah:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">95</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shevi’ith 7:3.</i> “A man may not gather in the [wild] vegetables in a field and sell them in the market; but he may gather them in and his son may sell them for him;” and we were also taught there:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 9:1.</i> “Rue, goosefoot, etc. may be bought from anyone in the Sabbatical year, since no watch is kept over the like of these” [wild vegetables, and, since they are ownerless, the sanctity of the Sabbatical year does not apply to them].<br>Now some [scholars] say<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">97</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This opinion is stated by Rambam, <i>Hilchoth Sh’mitah V’yoveil</i> 4:3. See my Hebrew commentary p. 170 for the text.</i> that [in the case of] these vegetables mentioned [in the above Mishnah] and all similar ones, which people do not usually sow, but which grow by themselves on mountains and near rivers, the prohibition of aftergrowths does not apply to them at all even though they grew in the Sabbatical year, since the Rabbis only forbade [the aftergrowths of] those things which are normally planted, in order that one should not plant them [in the Sabbatical year and then say that they grew by themselves]. And so it appears from the Gemara of the Yerushalmi [mentioned above]. This is the subject of “aftergrowths” whenever the Sages mention it [in the Talmud].<br>Similarly it is [forbidden by law] of the Torah for a person to guard his field and lock it up from the poor in the Sabbatical year, even if he intends to declare them free for all at the time of gathering them in; instead, the field is to be ready and free for the poor throughout the year. Thus the Sages taught in the Mechilta:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">98</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mechilta, <i>Kaspa</i> 20.</i> “<i>That the poor of thy people may eat</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">99</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 23:11.</i> ‘Why did the Torah say this? Was it not so that the poor may eat it? If so, I am going to gather in the fruit and distribute it among the poor’. Therefore Scripture states, <i>But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie fallow</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">99</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 23:11.</i> This teaches that the owner is even [obliged] to make breaches in the fence [so that everyone may come and take]. The Sages, however, as a precaution for the general good, allowed him to keep the fence.” Now the restraining measure which the Sages established was only that he need not make breaches in the fences of his field and vineyard, but not that he may guard his field and gather in the fruits, thereby transgressing the words of the Torah. Moreover, the Sages even decreed against buying fruits which have been guarded, or even from one who is under suspicion of so [guarding]. It is with reference to this that we have been taught in the Mishnah:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 9:1.</i> “[The wild vegetables mentioned] may be bought from anyone in the Sabbatical year, since no watch is kept over the like of these.” And in Tractate Succah the Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">100</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Succah 39 a-b.</i> “One may not hand over to those ignorant of the law more of the monetary equivalent of fruits of the Sabbatical year than that needed for three meals.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">101</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Three meals are needed for the Sabbath, and since it is permitted to give it to him before the Sabbath in order that he may buy the three required meals, it is permitted throughout the week (<i>ibid.</i>). See also the following note for fuller explanation.</i> This applies only where he buys [the fruits] from a field which was free for all,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">102</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, if the <i>chaver</i> (a person who is faithful in observing the law) sees the owner [who is ignorant of the law] taking the fruits from an unguarded field, he may give him the monetary equivalent of three meals’ worth of fruits; but he is not permitted to give the owner more money than that required for three meals, for since such money must be spent according to the restrictions of the sanctity of the Sabbatical year [i.e., he must spend it only for food, drink or unguent] it is feared that the seller receiving such money may not do so. But the Sages permitted the <i>chaver</i> to give him the monetary equivalent of three meals so that he may have sufficient food for himself [for a day] (Rashi, <i>ibid.</i>).</i> but if he buys from a guarded field, even the value of half an <i>issar</i> is forbidden.” And the reason for this is as follows: When the purchaser buys it from a field which was free for all — that is to say, from things which people usually bring from ownerless property, or if it is known that he brought them from a place which was declared free for all — then [the purchaser who knows and observes the law] is permitted to buy the fruit. However, if he gives the owner more money than is needed for his [three] meals on that day, we suspect that the [seller who is] ignorant of the law might use [this money] for the purpose of business [which he is forbidden to do]. But if he buys things which it is customary to guard, then even if it is [no more than the value of] half an <i>issar</i>, we suspect that [the seller, being ignorant of the law], guarded them, in which case it is forbidden to buy from him. However if he buys a <i>perutah’s</i> worth of fruits, or less than half an <i>issar</i>, the Sages did not prohibit this, because it is customary for people to gather them in from any [unguarded] place, even during the other years of the Sabbatical cycle.<br>It is referring to this that the Sages have taught:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">103</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yebamoth 122 a.</i> “If a non-Jew was selling fruits in the market, and he said [by way of praising his products], ‘These fruits are <i>orlah</i> [of the first three years’ growth, and are therefore better than the fruit of an old tree], or ‘they are of <i>azeikah</i>’ [a term explained further on], he has said nought [i.e., we do not believe his statement that the fruits are <i>orlah</i> etc., and hence forbidden; instead we say that these fruits come from the majority of trees which are nor <i>orlah</i>, and they therefore may be eaten]. For the seller only intended to praise his products.” Now Rashi explained there in the name of the early scholars,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">104</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See in <i>Seder Emor</i>, Note 485.</i> [that the term <i>azeikah</i> means that the fruits come] from an orchard “that is enclosed” with a fence around it, and it happens to be the Sabbatical year. Now if we were to believe him [the non-Jewish seller], it would be forbidden to buy the fruits from him in a city wherein most [of the inhabitants] are Jews, lest he is a tenant-laborer of a Jew and guards the field for him; or we would suspect that he may have gathered [these fruits] from a field belonging to a Jew [who has not declared them free for all] and he sells them; or that the fruits belong to a Jew and he is selling them for him. Or perhaps [even if the land belongs to the seller], a gentile cannot make such an acquisition in the Land of Israel as to negate the laws of the Sabbatical year [from his produce]. The Rabbis therefore decreed that the fruits of his field are to be regarded as those of an Israelite [and hence subject to all the laws of the Sabbatical year]. Nonetheless, the Sages did not prohibit the fruits of a guarded field [in the Sabbatical year] to everybody, but only [decreed] that one should not buy them directly from the owner who guarded them [but it is not the fruits themselves of a guarded field which are prohibited; thus if they have already been sold to a first purchaser, another Jew may buy them from him]. Therefore the Rabbis taught in the Torath Kohanim:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">105</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Behar</i> 1:3.</i> “<i>And the grapes of thy undressed vine thou shalt not gather</i>. From that which was guarded when in the land you are not to gather, but you may gather from that which was free for all. <i>Thou shalt not gather</i>, in the [ordinary] manner of those who gather grapes. It was on the basis of this that the Sages said: ‘Seventh-year figs may not be cut with a special fig-knife [but may be cut with an ordinary knife]; grapes may not be pressed in a wine-press, but one may press them in a vat.’” And the meaning thereof is as follows: Since it is not written “the grapes of the undressed vine thou shalt not reap,” but instead it is written <i>‘thy’ undressed vine</i>, it is to be interpreted that you are not to gather them in the way you usually gather your grapes, but you may gather them together with the poor in the way that they gather them, meaning to say that he is not to guard them for himself, but he is to gather them with the poor as if they were ownerless. Similarly he is to treat them [after he has gathered them in] as the poor do, and press them in a vat. And it is further taught there [in the Torath Kohanim]:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">106</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 1:5.</i> “<i>And the Sabbath-produce of the Land shall be for food for you</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">107</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 6.</i> You are to eat from that which rested in the land [as will be explained], but you may not eat from that which was guarded. Hence the dictum of the Sages:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">108</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shevi’ith 4:2.</i> The School of Shammai say, one may not eat from the produce of a field which has been industriously tilled.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">109</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Mishnah refers to a time when the Rabbis permitted tilling the ground <i>once</i> in the Sabbatical year in order to enable the people to pay the Roman government the tax imposed on land, as failure to do so could have led to mortal danger. But if the owner tilled the land <i>twice</i>, the question arises whether the produce thereof may be eaten, since a field which was tilled twice is treated as a field that was guarded.</i> But the School of Hillel say that one may eat of it.’” That is to say, since the Torah stated that the produce of the Sabbath should be for us for food, and not that which was guarded, the School of Shammai say that the fruits themselves become prohibited [and therefore the produce of a field which was tilled twice, and considered as a field that was guarded, may not be eaten]; but the School of Hillel are of the opinion that the fruits themselves are not prohibited, for Scripture’s intention is only to forbid us to guard [our produce], in order that our crops should be from a field in which the Sabbatical rest was observed. Similarly when the Rabbis have said<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">110</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shevi’ith 8:6, and referred to in the Torath Kohanim (<i>Behar</i> 1:3) mentioned above.</i> that seventh-year figs may not be cut with a [special] fig-knife, and grapes may not be pressed in a wine-press, [these laws are] a “fence” and guard of Rabbinic origin, in order that people should not come to guard and gather in their crops, and rob them from the poor. This is [the meaning of] that which is taught here in these Beraithoth [of the Torath Kohanim], and it is the best and clearest exposition of the discussions in the Babylonian and Jerusalem Gemara. The scholar who is acquainted [with the Talmud] will succeed in finding these texts."

                    "AND FOR THY CATTLE, AND FOR THE BEASTS THAT ARE IN THY LAND, SHALL ALL THE INCREASE THEREOF BE FOR FOOD. “If wild beasts may eat thereof, how much more so is this the case with cattle which it is your duty to feed! Why then does it say <i>and for thy cattle</i>? [Scripture mentioned it] in order to liken cattle to the beast. As long as the wild beast is able to eat of [the produce of] the field, you may feed your cattle with that [which is stored] in the house; when food has disappeared for the wild beast in the field, remove it [what is stored] for your cattle from the house [and make it available to all animals alike].” This is Rashi’s language, taken from the Torath Kohanim.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">113</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Behar</i> 1:8.</i><br>The Rabbi [Rashi] did not, however, explain [the meaning of] this Removal. Its purport is that after a certain time the owner must remove all produce from his house and declare it ownerless [i.e., after food has disappeared for the wild beast from the field], this being “the Removal of the Seventh-year [produce]” which the Sages mention everywhere. Now the intention thereof is not that after the time of Removal it is forbidden for him to derive benefit from the produce or to eat, and that the owner must destroy it, for the Sages have not listed the fruits of the Seventh year in the Mishnah<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">114</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Temurah 33 b.</i> among those things that must be burnt, nor among those that must be buried. Rather, [the meaning of the Removal] is only that he must remove them from his control, and declare them free for the poor and for all people, similar to that which it says, <i>I have put away the hallowed things out of my house</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">115</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 26:13.</i> [in which case it obviously does not mean that he destroys <i>the hallowed things</i>, but rather that he gives them to whomever they belong, e.g. the heave-offering to the priest, etc.]. And so we have been taught in a Mishnah:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">116</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shevi’ith 9:8.</i> “The poor may eat [of the produce] after the Removal, but not the rich. These are the words of Rabbi Yehudah. Rabbi Yosei says: Both the poor and the rich may eat of the produce after the Removal.” The meaning of the term “the poor” is all people who gather the produce of fields of other people which have been declared ownerless, and “the rich” means the owners of the fields themselves, who gathered the produce of their own fields after they declared them free for all. Now Rabbi Yehudah declared that they [these “rich” former owners] are forbidden by law of the Rabbis to gather in from their own fields, on account of suspicion [that they did not really intend to make their fields free for all], but Rabbi Yosei permitted them [to gather in from their own fields], and the final decision of the law is according to his words. This Mishnah is also found in the Torah Kohanim.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">117</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Behar</i> 1:6.</i><br>And in the Tosephta it is stated:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">118</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tosephta Shevi’ith 8:1-4. On “Tosephta” see above in <i>Seder Tazria</i>, Note 124.</i> “Originally messengers of the court would go around the entrances of the cities; if anyone had brought the produce [of the Seventh year] into his possession, they would take it from him and give him enough food for three meals, and the rest they would put into a store-house in the city. When the time of [the ripening of] figs came, the court’s messengers would hire workers to pick them, and they would make them into cakes of pressed figs [and then put them into the store-house in the city]. When the time [of the ripening] of olives came, the court’s messengers would hire workers to harvest them, press them in olive-presses and put [the oil] into barrels, and then they would put them into the store-house in the city. When the time of [the ripening of] grapes came, the court’s messengers would hire workers to gather them, press them in a wine-press and put [the wine] into barrels, and they would put them into the store-house in the city. On the day preceding the [weekly] Sabbath they would distribute the food from them [the store-houses] to each and every one according to the needs of his family. When the time of the Removal arrived, the poor would eat after the Removal, but not the rich. These are the words of Rabbi Yehudah. Rabbi Yosei says: Both poor and rich may eat after the Removal. Rabbi Shimon says: The rich may eat from the store-house after the Removal.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">119</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For with respect to the store-house, all people are regarded as “poor,” but an owner of a field may not eat of his own fruits after the Removal. Rabbi Shimon’s teaching is thus a sort of middle position between that of Rabbi Yehudah and Rabbi Yosei.</i> [When the time of the Removal came] he who had produce to distribute gave it to the poor. If someone had produce of the Seventh year [and he lived in a place where there was no store-house, nor a functioning court to supervise the distribution], and the time of Removal was come, he would distribute some of it to his neighbors, relatives and friends, and [the remainder] he would take out and place at the door of his house, and say: ‘Brethren, house of Israel! Whoever has to take, let him come and take!’ And then he may bring [the rest] back into his house and continue to eat of it until it is finished.”<br>All this is taught in the Tosephta, and from it we clearly learn that the term “Removal” only means that [the Seventh-year produce] must be taken out of the owner’s possession, and that he must declare it free for all, and that [for the fulfillment of this law] the Rabbis made various ordinances. Originally the court used to make a store-house in each and every city. As soon as the fruits ripened, they would take them from those who brought them [from their fields] and put them into the store-house. Thus when the time of the harvest for the whole of that crop would arrive, such as when the time had come for reaping the grain or gathering the grapes, the [messengers of the] court would hire workers to gather the grapes, pick the olives and harvest the whole of that species, and then they would press the grapes in a wine-press and the olives in an olive-press as one does during any other year, and put them into their store-house. Now this produce which was gathered into the store-house of the court required no other act of “Removal,” since they were already removed from the homes [of their owners], and both poor and rich were permitted after the time of the Removal to come and receive them from the court’s messengers, and to eat them. All this ordinance and trouble taken by the court was on account of suspicion, that [if the court were not to act in this manner] people would hold on to it [the produce of the Seventh year] or do business with it. And where there was no store-house in the city, nor a [functioning] court, and the produce remained in the hands of he who gathered it in from ownerless property, then he must remove it from his house when the time of Removal comes, and declare it free for all at the door of his house, and from then on he is permitted to continue eating from it [as long as it lasts]. This is [what the Rabbis meant in saying<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">120</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nedarim 58 a.</i> that] Seventh-year produce renders forbidden [a mixture] of its own kind in the smallest of quantities as far as the Removal is concerned,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">121</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus if a person took an onion which grew in the sixth year [of the Sabbatical cycle] and replanted it in the seventh year, even though it only grows a small amount in the seventh year the whole onion is subject to the law of Removal, as if it had grown entirely in the seventh year. Normally any forbidden food which becomes unrecognizable in a mixture the majority of which consists of permitted food, is considered negligible and “annulled” by the majority according to the law of the Torah [however, the Rabbis usually required a ratio of 60:1, for the forbidden food to become annulled]. However, any forbidden food which will at some future time have a permitted status, can never become annulled even if it is a minute part of the permitted part of the mixture; for why should we annul it now when it will eventually become permitted automatically? Here too, since the minute forbidden part of the onion which grew in the seventh year will automatically become permitted to be eaten when the owner declares it free for all at the time of Removal, it does not become annulled by the rest of the onion. Thus the whole of the onion is subject to the law of Removal [since we do not know which is the bit which grew in the seventh year]; and if the owner does not declare it free for all, it is completely forbidden. Ramban quotes this to prove that Removal does not mean destruction of the produce, but merely declaring it free for all, as the Gemara clearly states that it becomes permitted after Removal.</i> as is mentioned in Tractate Nedarim,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">120</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nedarim 58 a.</i> because it may be rendered permissible by removal from his house.<br>Now I have found the following comment of Rashi which he wrote in Tractate Pesachim:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">122</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Pesachim 58 a.</i> “And it is this which constitutes their ‘removal’ — that he is to make them free for all in a place where human beings and animals tread.” Perhaps the Rabbi thought that the owner has to make it free also for beasts and cattle, in order to fulfill that which is written concerning them, <i>that the poor of thy people may eat</i>, [<i>and what they leave the beast of the field shall eat</i>];<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">123</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 23:11.</i> <i>and for thy cattle, and for the beasts that are in thy Land</i> [<i>shall all the increase thereof be for food</i>].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">124</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 7 before us.</i> In this he [Rashi] has stated the matter too strongly, for [as we explain it] eating of the produce [after the Removal] is not prohibited at all. And the Rabbis have already taught in the Tosephta that the Removal of the [produce of the] Seventh year is like the removal [mentioned] in connection with the Second Tithe<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">115</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 26:13.</i>, and there is no difference between them as far as prohibition of eating them [for just as the Second Tithe is eaten, so the Seventh-year produce may be eaten].<br>Now Rabbi Moshe [ben Maimon]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">125</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishneh Torah, <i>Hilchoth Sh’mitah V’yoveil</i> 7:3.</i> and many of the Sages<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">126</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Such as Rabad (Rabbi Abraham ben David of Posqieres) who agrees with Rambam on this point (Keseph Mishneh <i>ibid.</i>).</i> are, however, of the opinion that the Removal renders the produce completely forbidden, and it must be burnt, or spread about and scattered in the wind, or thrown into the sea. But it is not so, as has been explained. If, however, he retained it in his home after the [time for the] Removal so that he may eat thereof, then it does become completely forbidden as food. This is the Seventh-year produce which renders [a mixture of a <i>different</i> kind] forbidden, [but only] if it is enough to give [the entire mixture] its flavor, since it has no permitted status [after the Removal; and therefore if the Seventh-year produce is not enough to give its flavor into the entire mixture, it becomes “annulled” by the majority of permitted food, but if it is enough to give it its flavor, it is not annulled].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">127</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Note 121 above.</i> It is possible that this prohibition is [only] by law of the Rabbis; perhaps even the whole matter of Removal is a stringency imposed by the Scribes, and the Beraithoth taught in the Torath Kohanim on the subject of Removal are only Scriptural supports for a matter which is of Rabbinic origin.<br>On this basis the following Mishnah can be well-explained:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">128</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shevi’ith 9:5.</i> “If one pickles three kinds of vegetables [of Seventh-year produce] in a single barrel etc.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">129</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Rabbi Eliezer says: they may be eaten only as long as the first [to ripen of the three kinds] remains in the field. Rabbi Yehoshua says: Even until the last [to ripen of the three kinds] remains in the field, etc.” Ramban intends to say that if, as mentioned above, the whole law of Removal of Seventh-year produce is only a decree of Rabbinic origin, we may well understand why Rabbi Yehoshua is lenient in this case. — See also Ramban further on in Verse 12 where he quotes this whole text from the Torath Kohanim, and it is more fully explained.</i> Similarly [we may well understand] the following Mishnah:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">130</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 6:1.</i> “Three countries are to be distinguished as regards the Seventh year.” There we are taught: “Throughout that part of the Land of Israel which those that came up from Babylon occupied, as far as Chezib,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">131</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the city of Achzib, mentioned in Joshua 19:29, and Judges 1:31. It was in the vicinity of Acco, as is clear from the verse in the Book of Judges (Tifereth Yisrael). To understand this Mishnah it is important to remember that the sanctity first imparted to the Land of Israel by Joshua’s conquests came to an end with the destruction of the First Temple. Now when the Jews returned from the Babylonian exile and reoccuppied the Land, their settlement was not as large as that originally occupied by those that came up from Egypt. The sanctity imparted to this part of the Land which was re-occupied by the Babylonian exiles was never lost again; and it is to this part that the laws of the Seventh year fully apply.</i> [Seventh-year produce] may not be eaten [without Removal], and [the land] may not be cultivated. Throughout that part of the Land which those that came up from Egypt occupied [but which was not later occupied by those that came up from the Babylonian captivity], from Chezib<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">130</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 6:1.</i> to the river<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">132</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the Brook of Egypt (Joshua 15:47) in the south (Tifereth Shlomoh).</i> and [from Chezib] to Amanah,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">133</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e. Mount Hor (Numbers 34:7) to the north. The Mishnah thus covers two points from Chezib: from the south thereof to the Brook of Egypt, and from the north thereof to Mount Hor (Tifereth Shlomoh).</i> [Seventh-year produce] may be eaten [without Removal], but [the land] may not be cultivated.” Thus the Sages were more lenient as regards eating [the Seventh-year produce] after the time of Removal [without having gone through the actual act of Removal] than they were as regards cultivating [the land].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">134</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As suggested above by Ramban, the reason for this leniency concerning Removal may be that the whole matter is of Rabbinic origin.</i> And in the Yerushalmi it is mentioned:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">135</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yerushalmi Shevi’ith, end of Chapter 9.</i> “A certain person who was suspected of [breaking the law of] Seventh-year produce said to his wife, ‘Separate the dough-offering [from the dough].’ Thereupon she said to him, ‘That person [i.e., you] is suspected of breaking the law of Seventh-year produce, and he tells me to separate the dough-offering!’ He said to her, ‘The dough-offering is a matter of Scriptural law; the law of the Seventh-year produce was ordained by the Rabbis, Rabban Gamaliel and his colleagues.’” That unworthy man was suspected of retaining produce of the Seventh year and eating it after the [time of] Removal, and he said that the prohibition of eating <i>tevel</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">136</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See above in <i>Seder Emor</i>, Note 108.</i> is a law of the Torah, but the Removal and the prohibition of eating Seventh-year produce after the Removal was ordained by Rabban Gamaliel and his colleagues. Or it may be that [he meant that although] the Removal itself is by law of the Torah, the prohibition of eating from the produce after the [time of] Removal [if one did not fulfill the law of Removal] is by law of the Rabbis — and he was only particular not to eat that which is forbidden by the Torah. Now since the Sages have mentioned the words of this person, it would seem that they are correct [inasmuch as that the prohibition against eating produce after the Removal, was enacted only by the Rabbis, as explained above]. Or perhaps [this is no indication that such is the accepted opinion of the law, because it may be] that this wicked person relied upon the [unaccepted] opinion of Rabbi Shimon<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">137</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Moed Katan 2 b. In other words, this was why the Talmud Yerushalmi quoted the words of this man. In our editions of the Gemara, the version is “Rabbi” [the editor of the Mishnah] instead of Rabbi Shimon.</i> who says: “Scripture speaks of two kinds of release [the release of land and the release of money],”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">138</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 15:2: <i>And this is the manner of the ‘release:' every creditor shall ‘release’ that which he hath lent unto his neighbor</i>. The double use of the term “release” indicates that Scripture speaks here of two kinds of release: the release of the land in the Sabbatical year, and the release of monetary debts, and Scripture likens one to another to teach us the following: “At a time the release of the land is in force the release of money is obligatory, but at a time when the release of the land is not in force, the release of money is not obligatory.” And since Rabbi Shimon speaks of “a time when the release of the Land is not obligatory,” he must be referring to the time after the destruction of the Second Temple. (Rashi, Moed Katan 2 b). Thus it is clear that Rabbi Shimon is of the opinion that the law of the Seventh-year produce nowadays is of Rabbinic enactment.</i> and the law of the Seventh-year nowadays is of Rabbinic authority, although the law of removing the dough-offering [in the Land of Israel] is of the Torah."

The title also appears above at the end of Verse 7: “Rabban Gamaliel.” Rabban Yochanan ben Zaccai was the leading Sage in the period of the destruction of the Second Temple [in the year 70 Common Era]. It was he who went to Vespasian the Roman general and obtained permission to open an academy at Jabneh, which, after the destruction of the Temple, took the place of the Sanhedrin as the supreme religious authority for the Jewish people. Under his leadership a number of regulations were instituted by the Sages in remembrance of the Temple.</i> after the Temple was destroyed. This was decreed [by Rabban Yochanan ben Zaccai], because they [the Sages] prohibited the blowing of the <i>Shofar</i> [if the New Year fell on a Sabbath]. Since everyone is obliged to blow the <i>Shofar</i> [or to hear it blown, but not everyone is expert in it, thus we fear that] perhaps he will take the <i>Shofar</i> in his hand and go to an expert to learn, and thus he will carry it the distance of four cubits in a public thoroughfare [which is forbidden by law of the Torah on the Sabbath]; and Rabban Yochanan ben Zaccai therefore only permitted us to do it at the court [where the fear of the judges ensures that nobody will violate the Sabbath on account of the blowing of the <i>Shofar</i>]. There is thus no basis whatsoever for this prohibition in Scripture [and so how could Rashi interpret the verse before us on the basis of this Rabbinic enactment]? And the Rabbis, in mentioning that “the blowing of the <i>Shofar</i> on the tenth day [of the seventh month] overrides the Sabbath,” intended to say that it is done on every Day of Atonement [in the Jubilee year, whether it falls on a weekday or on the Sabbath]; for there is no difference between overriding the Day of Atonement when it falls on the Sabbath or when it falls on a weekday, since the Day of Atonement itself is like the Sabbath in respect of [the prohibition of] all work, whether that of carrying [an object four cubits in a public thoroughfare, or transferring it from “public” to “private” ground and vice versa], or any other kind of [forbidden] work.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">141</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban’s point here is as follows: As far as the blowing of the <i>Shofar</i> on the New Year is concerned, there is a clear distinction between a New Year which falls on a weekday and one which occurs on the Sabbath. In the latter case, Rabban Yochanan ben Zaccai prohibited blowing the <i>Shofar</i> [except at the court] lest someone may accidentally carry the <i>Shofar</i> and thereby transgress a law of the Torah, as explained in the text. But when the New Year falls on a weekday, there is no question of forbidding blowing the <i>Shofar</i>, because carrying on a festival is permitted. But on the Day of Atonement, unlike other festivals, carrying is prohibited as on the Sabbath. Thus when the Beraitha quoted by Rashi states that the blowing of the Jubilee horn was permitted on the Day of Atonement which fell on the Sabbath, this is equivalent to saying that it is permitted on <i>every</i> Day of Atonement, whether weekday or Sabbath. Hence the thought conveyed by the Beraitha is not as Rashi has it [that the blowing of the Jubilee overrides the Sabbath day], for as the Day of Atonement is concerned everyday of the week is like the Sabbath!</i> Even so, the Rabbi [Rashi] wished to teach us that the blowing of the <i>Shofar</i> on the Day of Atonement is to be done in all places, for the meaning of the expression <i>ye shall make proclamation with the horn throughout all your Land</i> is to teach us that each individual is obliged to blow [or hear the sound of] the <i>Shofar</i>, and that the blowing is not done only at the court, as is the counting [of the years].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">142</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 25:8.

Its name is <i>yoveil</i> [literally: ‘the ram’s horn’] on account of the blowing of the <i>Shofar</i>.” This is Rashi’s language, and such also is the opinion of the commentators<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">143</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R’dak in Sefer Hashorashim (Book of Roots), under the root <i>yoveil</i>.</i> that [the word <i>yoveil</i> here] is of the roots: <i>‘b’keren hayoveil’</i> (<i>with the ram’s horn</i>);<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">144</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 6:5.</i> <i>‘shofroth ha’yovlim’</i> (<i>the rams’ horns</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">145</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 4.</i> But I do not find this acceptable, because of [the expression here] <i>shall be unto you</i> [<i>it shall be a Jubilee unto you</i>]<i>;</i> for what sense is there in saying of a year that “it shall be ‘a blowing’ unto you”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">146</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For since Rashi explained that the term <i>yoveil</i> means “blowing the <i>Shofar</i>,” then it follows that <i>‘yoveil hi’ the fiftieth year shall be unto you</i> means that “the fiftieth year shall be blowing the <i>Shofar</i> to you.” But how can this be said of a year? Mizrachi in defense of Rashi writes that Rashi means that “the year in which every man returns to his possession and to his family, is called <i>yoveil</i> (Jubilee) on account of the blowing of the <i>Shofar</i>,” but not that the word <i>yoveil</i> means “blowing.”</i> <i>and you shall return</i> [<i>every man unto his possession</i> etc.]? Perhaps Scripture is stating: “<i>It is a Jubilee</i> distinguishable by that name which I have called it, <i>and it shall be unto</i> all of <i>you</i> known by the blowing of the <i>Shofar</i> which you will do thereon, reminding you of the purport [of the Jubilee year], that in it <i>every man shall return unto his possession, and every man unto his family</i>.” Similarly, <i>A Jubilee shall that fiftieth year be unto you</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">147</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 11.</i> means that it shall be a Jubilee unto you, that <i>ye shall not sow, neither reap</i>, that is to say, it is known by its name that it is to be so.<br>But all this appears to me to be incorrect. For the meaning of <i>shofroth ha’yovlim</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">145</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 4.</i> is “the horns of the rams,” and Yonathan [ben Uziel] also translated there: “<i>shofroth</i> [made] of rams’ horns.” It is also so stated in the Gemara:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">148</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rosh Hashanah 26 a.</i> “What intimation is there that the term <i>yoveil</i> is an expression for a ram? In Arabic they call a ram <i>yovlo</i>.” Now the <i>Shofar</i> used on the Day of Atonement [in the Jubilee year] does not necessarily need to be a ram’s horn, for all <i>shofroth</i> (horns) are valid on it, and in the opinion of our Mishnah<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">149</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 26 b.</i> and all the Tannaim (Sages of the Mishnah), the commandment is [preferably to be performed in the year of the Jubilee] with the horn of wild goats. If so, why then would the [Jubilee] year be called “the year of the ram?”<br>Now Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra said that the meaning of <i>yoveil</i> is like “sending forth.” In my opinion, Scripture does not call the year <i>yoveil</i> with reference to the blowing [of the <i>Shofar</i>], but with reference to “the liberty” [that it brings to the inhabitants of the Land]; for this term is not mentioned in the first verse which states, <i>Then shalt thou make proclamation with the blast of the horn</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">150</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 9.</i> But when He stated [in the verse before us] <i>and ye shall proclaim liberty throughout the Land unto all the inhabitants thereof</i>, meaning that they shall all be free to reside wherever they please, He continued by saying <i>‘yoveil hi,’</i> that it is a year in which every man is “carried away” to his possession, and his feet “transport him” to his family <i>afar off to sojourn</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">151</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 23:7.</i> This term [<i>yoveil</i>] is used in connection with many subjects.

Similarly in Aramaic [as will be explained]. Thus: <i>and carry it quickly</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">157</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 17:11.</i> the Targum renders: “<i>v’ovil</i> quickly.” Thus the meaning of <i>it shall be ‘yoveil’ unto you</i> is “it is a year which ‘brings’ [liberty] and it shall be so to all of you, that you shall come <i>and return every man unto his possession, and every man unto his family</i>.” And He stated again [in the following verse], <i>A ‘yoveil’ shall that fiftieth year be unto you</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">147</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 11.</i> meaning that the fiftieth year shall be to you only for <i>yoveil</i> [“bringing” liberty], and not for anything else, and <i>ye shall not sow, neither reap</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">147</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 11.</i> but instead it <i>shall be holy</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">158</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 12.</i> and <i>every man shall return unto his possession</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">159</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 13.</i> so that the year shall be for all of you a <i>yoveil</i> [bringing everyone back to his possession and family], as its name indicates.<br>And by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], the term <i>d’ror</i> (liberty) is related to the expression, <i>‘dor’</i> (<i>a generation</i>) <i>passeth away, ‘v’dor’</i> (<i>and a generation</i>) <i>cometh</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">160</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ecclesiastes 1:4.

Now our Rabbis have derived from here [the law] that one who sells his field has no right to redeem it before two years [after the date of the sale, for the verse states, <i>according to the number of ‘years’ of the crops he shall sell</i>, and the minimum number of the term ‘years’ is two], even if there were three crops in those two years. [However, although this interpretation of the Rabbis indicates that the verse in speaking of <i>shnei</i> means ‘two years’], it does not lose its literal meaning [i.e., ‘years of’], that is to say, he is to sell by the number of ‘years of’ crops, and not by years when the produce is smitten by blast,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">169</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus, if during one of the two years after the sale the produce was smitten by blast, the vendor does not have the right to redeem his field until three years have elapsed, so that the purchaser has enjoyed at least two crops.</i> and the minimum number implied in ‘years’ is two.” Thus far is Rashi’s language.<br>Now this is indeed the correct interpretation of the verse; however, our Rabbis have said that overcharge does not apply in [the sale of] land, for it is said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">170</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Baba Metzia 56 b.</i> “<i>Or buy of thy neighbor’s ‘hand’</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">171</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 14 before us.</i> and this refers to something which is transferred from ‘hand’ to ‘hand’” [i.e., movable goods or chattels]. But this verse according to the Rabbi [Rashi], both in its plain meaning and its [Rabbinical] interpretation, speaks of [overcharging in the sale of] land! We must then perforce turn the verses away from their simple meaning, and say that each one stands independently [of the others].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">172</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus while Rashi interpreted all three verses [14-16] as applying to business transactions, Ramban interprets only Verse 14 in that way, while Verses 15-16 refer only to keeping the laws of the Jubilee, and Verse 17 prohibits all kind of wronging by words. Thus, as Ramban expresses it, “we must perforce turn the verses away from their simple meaning, and say that each one stands independently of the others.”</i> Thus Scripture is stating: <i>And if thou sell aught unto thy neighbor, or buy of thy neighbor’s hand</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">171</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 14 before us.</i> that is, something which is transferred from hand to hand, <i>ye shall not wrong one another</i>. Then He states further: “<i>According to the number of years after the Jubilee thou shalt buy</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">168</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 15.</i> of him the crops, <i>and according unto the number of years of the crops he shall sell</i> them <i>unto thee</i>. According to the years you shall increase and reduce the price,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">173</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Verse 16.</i> for you will have to return it [i.e., the land] to him in the Jubilee.” All this is an admonition regarding the Jubilee, that they should keep it forever [but it is not intended as a law against overcharging in the sale of land, for in such a transaction the law of overcharge does not apply]. Then He said further, <i>And ye shall not wrong one another</i>, [referring to wronging] by words [i.e., offending].<br>And it further seems to me logical that one who intentionally overcharges his fellowman, definitely transgresses a negative commandment, whether it be [in a sale of] chattels or land, for it is with reference to them that Scripture is saying, <i>Ye shall not wrong one another. According to the number of years after the Jubilee</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">174</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verses 14-15.</i> admonishing that one must buy and sell according to the years [after the Jubilee], and that no man shall wrong another. But our Rabbis laid down a new law regarding overcharge, namely, that [if the amount overcharged was] one-sixth of the total purchase-price, [the sale is valid and that extra amount] must be paid back, but the sale is totally invalidated if the amount overcharged was more than one-sixth of the purchase-price. It is only from this law that land has been excluded, since [a person] foregoes an overcharge of even more than a sixth [of the purchase-price] in the case of [the sale of land], just as one [is prepared to] forego in the case of chattels an overcharge of less than a sixth [of the purchase-price], although it is forbidden intentionally to overcharge by such [amounts], but people do not usually go back on their purchase on account of such a small overcharging. The Sages interpreted [Scripture to give a basis for this law] because the verse states, <i>And if thou sell aught unto thy neighbor, or buy</i> something which is transferred from hand to hand, <i>ye shall not wrong one another</i>. From this we learn that in the matter of overcharging there is a special law for chattels which does not apply to land, namely, the return of the money, [i.e., the cancellation of the entire sale if the amount overcharged was more than a sixth of the purchase-price], but the negative commandment [forbidding overcharging] applies to all transactions. That is why He said, <i>‘v’chi thim’kru mimkar’</i> [“if ‘ye’ sell aught”], which is a plural expression, referring to one who sells land and to one who sells chattels; <i>‘o kanoh’</i> (<i>or buys</i>) <i>of thy neighbor’s hand</i>, referring to an individual, who sells chattels from hand to hand, and with reference to all of them He said <i>ye shall not wrong</i>. But since He singled out and specified chattels, [it indicates that] He gave concerning them an additional law regarding overcharging, namely the [right to] return the money [of the purchase-price and thereby cancel the sale]. This is a correct interpretation according to the expositions which our Rabbis have received on the allusions of the Torah.<br>Perhaps all this is only a Scriptural support [for a Rabbinical enactment], for the negative commandment [<i>ye shall not wrong one another</i>] constitutes an admonition applying to both land and chattels [but does not refer at all to cancellation of the entire purchase], and [the right to return] the money the Rabbis received by tradition as applying to chattels and not to [transactions of] land, just as they have said<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">175</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Baba Kamma 14 b. See my Hebrew commentary, p. 177, Note 96.</i> that [land] is a possession that is worth any price. For all these [differing] standards of one-sixth [of the purchase-price, in which case the sale is valid and the amount overcharged must be returned], and more than one-sixth [in which case the entire sale may be cancelled] are based on people’s opinions [and since “land is worth any price” to most people, the Rabbis did not institute these laws of overcharging with respect to land]. And why should the Rabbis not exclude [transactions of] land from this law [of overcharging] just as they excluded from it wares bought from a householder. Thus they said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">176</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Baba Metzia 51 a.</i> “[The law of overcharging] is taught only if one buys from a merchant, but if one buys from a private householder, the law of overcharging does not apply,” because private people are not in the habit of selling the possessions that they use [and hence if they do sell them, it is considered as if they had made a specific condition that the buyer cannot complain about the price].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">177</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi <i>ibid.</i>, in the name of the <i>She’iltoth</i> of Rav Achai Gaon.</i><br>It is also possible to say that Scripture is warning that they [sellers and purchasers] should take cognizance of the number of years till the Jubilee, and according to them they should sell and buy, and no one shall wrong another because of them by misleading him about the number [of years], or by deceiving him about the sale, so that he thinks that it is in perpetuity, and thus he leads him astray thereby. Instead, they must both know and inform one another of this number, since the sale is according to the number of years [remaining] until the Jubilee, for even in [transactions of] land the law of overcharging applies as regards size and number,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">178</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, it is only with reference to price that specific laws of overcharging do not apply to land, but not with reference to size or number.</i> even if the misleading referred to was less than one-sixth [of the size or the number], and all the more so in the case of chattels [one must be careful not to overcharge]."

But if so, why does He warn about “selling” [saying, <i>the Land shall not be ‘sold’ in perpetuity</i>], when it should rather have said: “Thou shalt not <i>buy</i> in perpetuity”? Perhaps [the meaning of the verse is as if] it said, “<i>and the Land shall not be sold</i> to you <i>in perpetuity</i>” [and thus the prohibition refers to the buyer]. Similarly, <i>they shall not be sold as bondmen</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">183</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 42.</i> is an admonition to the purchaser, that he must send forth to freedom [a Hebrew servant] in the Jubilee year, according to the plain meaning of the verse.<br>It is, [however], possible that <i>the Land shall not be sold in perpetuity</i> is a negative commandment referring to the seller, that he is not to sell it permanently by saying: “I am selling it to you forever, even for after the Jubilee.” For although the Jubilee [in fact] takes it out of his possession [despite his intention of buying it permanently], Scripture nonetheless admonishes the seller or both of them that they should not [attempt to] make their transaction in perpetuity, and if they did so stipulate, they transgress this negative commandment, and [additionally] it will be of no avail to them, for the land <i>will</i> return in the Jubilee.

Rather, [the verse merely states] a reason [for the Jubilee], saying: “Observe between you [the law of] the Jubilee, and be not resentful about it, <i>for the Land is Mine</i>, and I do not want that it should be sold in perpetuity as [in the case of] other transactions.” This is the meaning [of the Rabbis’ interpretation] in the Torath Kohanim:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">186</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Behar</i> 4:8.</i> “<i>And the Land shall not be sold ‘litzmithuth’</i> — permanently. <i>For the Land is Mine</i> — [therefore] be not resentful about it. <i>For ye are strangers and settlers</i> — do not consider yourselves the main [proprietors]. <i>Ye are with Me</i> — it is enough for the servant to be as his Master.

According to their word, the interpretation of the verse appears to me to be as follows: It was the custom in former times in Israel that when a man had to sell his field, the person who had precedence in his inheritance [i.e., who was the nearest relative who could inherit] would come and buy it, and it was this that was called “redemption,” as it is said, <i>Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth, for the right of redemption is thine to buy it</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">199</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 32:7.</i> and so also is it explained there in the matter of Boaz.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">200</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ruth 4:4.</i> And it appears to me that they administered a law of precedence for him, just as our Rabbis enacted for us the law of [the prerogative of] the neighbor,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">201</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Baba Metzia 108 a. If a man wishes to sell his field, his neighbor has the special right of pre-emption — the right of purchasing before or in preference to others.</i> and [if other people wanted to buy it], they would acquire [the right of possession] from the “first redeemer” by the [symbolic act of] acquisition of a scarf, as did Boaz.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">202</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ruth 4:8: <i>So the near kinsman said unto Boaz: ‘Buy it for thyself.’ And he drew off his shoe</i>. See Ramban on Exodus 28:41.</i> Thus Scripture is stating here that when a Levite redeems the inheritance of a Levite, that is to say, when he buys it from him as is the law of redemption, then that [land] acquired shall go out in the Jubilee. It thus teaches that the Jubilee applies to them [the Levites] in the case of “redemption” just as in the case of any other sale [among Israelites]. Scripture did not have to mention this law in the case of a plain sale [i.e., to say that if a Levite sold his field to a non-Levite, who is not his near relative, that it goes back to its original owner, the Levite, in the Jubilee], for they [Levites] are part of all Israel [and it is self-understood that the same laws apply to them]; except that He strengthened their legal right [by giving them, as explained above], a perpetual [privilege of] redemption. This law of “redemption” applies also to Israelites [i.e., that if they bought from Levites, the Levites have an unrestricted right of redemption forever]. Scripture, however, mentioned it with reference to the Levites, in order that one should not say that the [forty-eight] cities<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">203</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 35:6-7.</i> were only given to the whole tribe of Levi [and not to any particular person], and that therefore [fields which a Levite had sold] go back from an Israelite [in the Jubilee, i.e., if the purchaser was an Israelite he must give them back], but they do not go back from a Levite [i.e., if the purchaser was a Levite he does not have to give them back, since they remain anyway in the hands of the Levitical tribe], and certainly [we might think that] from a near kinsman [i.e., a Levite] whom we have made liable to buy [the field of his poor brother-Levite, those fields surely do not go back in the Jubilee]; therefore He said that this <i>redemption</i> too goes back in the Jubilee, and from the [law stated in connection with the] Levite we deduce [that the same law applies] to the Israelites. It is possible also that the Levites are not permitted to sell of their cities in any transaction [i.e., whether a field or house] to an Israelite, and therefore all their purchases are termed <i>redemption</i> [because only other Levites, who are their kinsmen, can buy from them]."

Ben Peturi stated: ‘It is better that both should drink and die, rather than that one should witness the death of his colleague,’ until Rabbi Akiba came and taught: <i>that thy brother may live with thee</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">206</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 36.</i> — thy life takes precedence over the life of thy colleague.”<br>He repeated [the phrase] <i>that thy brother may live with thee</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">206</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 36.</i> in order to emphasize and stress [that we are not to take from him any interest or increase, as is stated in the first part of that verse]. And the Rabbinical interpretation is as follows:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">207</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Baba Metzia 62 a.</i> “Return to him the interest, so that he may live with you.” Thus He commanded the return of [previously] stipulated interest, similar to that which He said in the case of robbery, <i>and he shall restore that which he took by robbery</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">208</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 5:23. Interest is only forbidden by law of the Torah if it is previously stipulated, i.e., at the time of the loan, although the Rabbis forbade all interest.</i><br>Now Onkelos rendered <i>‘geir v’thoshav vachai imach’</i> [generally translated: <i>a stranger and a settler that he may live with thee</i>] as part of the positive commandments [enumerated here, thus meaning:] “he shall sojourn and settle and live with you.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">209</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The sense of the verse according to Onkelos is thus as follows: <i>And if thy brother be waxen poor, and his means fail with thee — then thou shalt uphold him</i>. And the verse continues to explain how you are to uphold him: “he is to sojourn and settle and live with thee.” But according to the Rabbis, as Ramban continues, the sense of the verse is etc.</i> But according to the opinion of our Rabbis in the Gemara,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">210</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Baba Metzia 71a. See my Hebrew Commentary p. 181.</i> the sense of the verse is as follows: [“<i>And if thy brother be waxen poor …</i>] <i>then thou shalt uphold him</i>, and [thou shalt also uphold] <i>a stranger and a settler</i>, so that each one of them <i>shall live with thee</i>.”"

The plain meaning of the verse appears to me to be that <i>neshech</i> (interest) is where, [for example], he lends him a hundred [shekels] and [the borrower is] to give him five shekels each year [for the use of the money, without deducting it from the capital sum of the loan]. It is so called [<i>neshech</i>, literally “biting”] because <i>at the last ‘yishach’</i> (<i>it biteth</i>) <i>like a snake</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">211</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 23:32.</i> [the effect of whose bite is not noticed immediately, but which] spurts and increases. <i>Tarbith</i> [or <i>ribith</i> — “increase”], however, is if he lends him [a sum of money] until a certain time, and then [the borrower is to] repay him and give him an increase of five shekels, but [even if the repayment should be delayed], there is no [additional] increase after that time [i.e., there is one fixed sum and not an annual percentage]; this [form of interest] does not “bite”, since it will not go up more than that [fixed] sum, but it is [nonetheless] “an increase.” Therefore He stated, <i>Thou shalt not give him thy money ‘b’neshech’</i> (<i>upon interest</i>), <i>nor give him thy food ‘b’marbith’</i> (<i>for increase</i>),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">212</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 37.</i> for it is customary to lend money for <i>neshech</i> (interest), [the borrower being obliged] to give every year [a certain amount of money for the use of the capital borrowed], but food is [usually] lent until the time of reaping, and then he pays him back out of his granary with a stipulated addition."

But these blessings which are stated in this section are general ones applying to the people [as a whole], and they [take effect] when the whole of our people <i>shall all be righteous</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 60:21.</i> Therefore He mentions here always <i>the Land: and the Land shall yield;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 4.</i> <i>in your Land safely;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 5.</i> <i>peace in the Land;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 6.</i> <i>out of the Land;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 6.</i> <i>it shall not go through your Land</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 6.</i><br>Now we have already explained<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See in Genesis 17:1 (Vol. I, pp. 215-216), and 46:15 (pp. 556-558). See also at the end of <i>Seder Bo</i> in the Book of Exodus (Vol. II, pp. 174-175).</i> that all these blessings are miracles, for it is not natural that the rains should come [in their due season], and that we should have peace from our enemies, and that they should have faintness of heart so that a hundred of them flee before five, as a result of us observing the statutes and commandments of G-d, nor that everything should be the opposite [i.e., that none of these things should happen] because of us planting in the Seventh year [which we are forbidden to do]. But although they are hidden miracles, for they are [brought about] by means of the natural events of the world occurring according to their habit, yet [the Torah mentions them separately because] they come to be known [as miracles] because of their constant and continuous occurrence in the whole Land. For if one righteous man lives and G-d takes away sickness from him, and he lives out his days, this also happens to some wicked people [and is thus not acknowledged as miraculous]. But when an entire land and a whole people always have rains coming in their season, and plenitude, security, peace, health, strength and defeat of their enemies, in a manner unparalleled in the whole world, it becomes known to all that <i>this is the Eternal’s doing</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 118:23.</i> Therefore He said [in connection with these blessings], <i>And all the peoples shall see that the Name of the Eternal is called upon thee, and they shall be afraid of thee</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 28:10.</i> And the opposite of this will occur because of the curses, when punishments will come upon the [whole] Land, just as He said, <i>and I will make your heaven as iron</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 19.</i> and punishments of sickness, as He said, <i>and sore sickness, and of long continuance</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 28:59.</i> meaning that the food will be spoiled and bring about sickness, and thus the miracle will be made known to all because of its continued existence amongst the whole people. Therefore it is written, <i>And the generation to come, your children that shall rise up after you, and the foreigner that shall come from a far land, shall say when they see the plagues of that Land, and its sicknesses</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 29:21.</i> For they will not wonder at that [single] man upon whom <i>all the curse that is written in this book shall lie</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 19.</i> for it happens many times in the natural order of the world, among all nations, that bad happenings come upon a certain individual.

But the verse can be compared to someone saying: “That person did not eat unleavened bread on the Festival of Passover, but instead [ate] leavened bread.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The intent of this statement is that the transgressor has committed two sins: not only has he failed to fulfill the positive commandment of eating unleavened bread (see “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 168-169), but he has also eaten <i>chametz</i> during Passover, which is forbidden by a negative commandment (<i>ibid.</i>, Vol. II, pp. 194-195). In the same way Scripture states that Asa committed two sins: he failed to seek G-d, and he consulted the physicians. This shows that consulting the physicians was not customary.</i> For he who seeks the Eternal through a prophet, will not consult the physicians. And what part do the physicians have in the house of those who do the will of G-d, after He has assured us, <i>and He will bless thy bread, and thy water, and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 23:25.</i> whereas the physicians are concerned [mostly] with food and drink, warning [the patient] against [eating] certain foods and commanding him [to eat] others.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rambam writes in a similar vein: “Most maladies that afflict people are the result of bad food, or of overeating even wholesome food” (Mishneh Torah, <i>Hilchoth Dei’oth</i> 4:15).</i> Thus also the Rabbis said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Horayoth 14 a. To understand the full significance of this Talmudic statement about Rav Yoseph, and especially about Rabbah’s connection with it [“During all the twenty-two years that Rabbah reigned …”] it is necessary to know the background of a certain event that transpired in their lives. When the post of chief of the Academy of Pumbeditha became vacant the Rabbis of Babylon were in doubt as to whom they should appoint — Rabbah or Rav Yoseph. Rabbah’s distinction was that he was the outstanding dialectician of his generation, while that of Rav Yoseph was that he was the greatest erudite scholar. When an inquiry was made of the Rabbis in the Land of Israel the answer came back: “An erudite scholar is preferable.” It was thus Rav Yoseph’s turn to become the head of the Academy. Yet in his humility Rav Yoseph refused to accept the post and insisted that Rabbah should reign. And thus for twenty-two years Rabbah continued to rule over the Academy of Pumbeditha. In recompense for his humility, the Talmudic story continues, Heaven rewarded Rav Yoseph that “During all the twenty-two years that Rabbah reigned Rav Yoseph did not call even a bloodletter to his house,” as was customary in those days, for his health was in such perfect condition. — See in Ein Ya’akov at end of Horayoth, in the commentary Hakotheiv, at end, for source of this beautiful interpretation. It expresses no doubt the intent of Ramban’s words here before us.</i> “During all the twenty-two years that Rabbah reigned [as head of the Academy at Pumbeditha], Rav Yoseph did not call even a blood letter to his house” [as he, being a righteous person, was protected directly by G-d and needed no physicians], and they also say by way of proverb:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shir Hashirim Rabbah 6:17.</i> “A gate which is not open for the commandments [i.e., a house wherein the commandments are not observed] is open for the physician.” This is also the meaning of their saying:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Berachoth 60 a.</i> “People should not have to take medicaments, but they have become accustomed to do so.” [That is to say]: had they not accustomed themselves to [taking] medicines, people would become sick according to the degree of punishment corresponding to their sin, and would be healed by the will of G-d, but since they accustomed themselves to medicaments, G-d has left them to natural happenings. This is also the intent of the Rabbis’ interpretation:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">64</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Baba Kamma 85 a.</i> “<i>And he shall cause him to be thoroughly healed</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 21:19.</i> From here [you deduce the principle] that permission has been given to the physician to heal.” They did not say that “permission was given to the sick to be healed” [by the physician], but instead they stated [by implication] that since the person who became sick comes [to the physician] to be healed, because he has accustomed himself to seeking medical help and <i>he was not of the congregation of</i> the Eternal <i>whose portion is in this life</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Numbers 27:3; Psalms 17:14.</i> the physician should not refrain from healing him; whether because of fear that he might die under his hand, since he is qualified in this profession, or because he says that it is G-d alone Who is the Healer of all flesh, since [after all] people have already accustomed themselves [to seeking such help]. Therefore when men contend and one smites the other <i>with a stone or his fist</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">67</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 21:18.</i> the one who smote must pay for the healing,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 21:19.</i> for the Torah does not base its laws upon miracles, just as it said, <i>for the poor shall never cease out of the Land</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 15:11.</i> knowing [beforehand] that such will be the case.

Of that [first] exile He stated, <i>Then shall the Land be paid her Sabbaths;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">119</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 34.</i> <i>As long as it lieth desolate it shall have a rest; even the rest which it had not</i> [<i>in your Sabbath</i>],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">120</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 35.</i> because the years of the [Babylonian] exile were [as many] as the years in which they failed to observe [the laws of] the Sabbatical years.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">121</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Rashi in Verse 35, who explains how the seventy years of the Babylonian exile correspond exactly to the seventy Sabbatical and Jubilee years that Israel failed to observe in the Land.</i> So also does Scripture state concerning that exile, [that it was] <i>To fulfill the word of the Eternal by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the Land had been paid her Sabbaths; for as long as she lay desolate she kept Sabbath, to fulfill threescore and ten years</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">122</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Chronicles 36:21.</i> Thus He warned them and thus it happened to them. If so, it is clear that Scripture speaks here of that [first] exile.<br>If you examine further the subject of the redemption from it [the Babylonian exile, you see], that He only assures [Israel] that He will remember the covenant of the fathers,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">123</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 42.</i> and of the remembrance of the Land,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">123</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 42.</i> but not that He will forgive their iniquity and their sin and that He will once again love them as of old, nor that He will gather together those of them who are dispersed. For such indeed happened when they came up from Babylon, for only [the tribes of] Judah and Benjamin returned together with a small group of Levites who were with them, and some<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">124</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ramban’s Sefer Hage’ulah (Kithvei Haramban, Vol. I, pp. 272-4) for a full discussion of this important matter — that in the return from Babylon there were small groups from the other tribes besides Judah and Benjamin, but the main bulk of them remained in their places, and hence the words of the prophets announcing their complete return, not having been fulfilled during the Second Temple, will yet assuredly come to transpire in the future. This is the deeper significance of Ramban’s expression here: “and <i>some</i> of the other tribes …” — “some” but not all, and therefore the words of G-d as spoken by His prophets will still be fulfilled in the future when the <i>ge’ulah shleimah</i> (the perfect redemption) will take place, as the return from Babylon did not represent that final and complete redemption. It is obvious that this constitutes a major principle in our faith of Israel’s future and destiny. Ramban will touch upon this theme of the perfect redemption further on in the text. See also further, Note 154.</i> of the [other] tribes that had been exiled to Babylon, and they returned in poverty, and in servitude to the kings of Persia.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">125</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ezra 9:9.</i> Nor does He state that they will return to Him in complete repentance, but only that <i>they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">126</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 40.</i> and we find that the people of the Second Temple did so, as Daniel confessed: <i>We have sinned, we have dealt iniquitously, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, and have turned aside from Thy commandments</i> etc.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">127</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Daniel 9:5.</i> <i>O Eternal, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">128</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 8. Thus they confessed also the sins of their fathers. The same applies to the following verses.</i> And it is further written, <i>because of our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Thy people are a reproach</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">129</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 16.</i> And so did Nehemiah confess.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">130</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nehemiah 1:6-7.</i> And Ezra said, <i>Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept Thy law</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">131</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 9:34. It should be noted that Scripture there ascribes the actual confession to the Levites, and Ezra’s name is not directly mentioned. However, the implication in Chapter 8 Verse 13 is clearly that it was at Ezra’s instigation that they kept the Festival of Tabernacles and the subsequent confession following it (see <i>ibid.</i>, 9:1). Besides, Ezra being a priest (<i>ibid.</i>, 8:2) he was automatically of the tribe of Levi and was thus included among the Levites who recited the confession.</i> Thus they all deduced from the Torah that they should confess their iniquity and [also] the iniquity of their fathers. All these [matters] are clear indications that this covenant does indeed allude to the first exile and the redemption therefrom.<br>However the covenant in the Book of Deuteronomy<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">132</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 28:1-69.</i> alludes to this our [present] exile, and to the redemption by which we will be redeemed from it. Thus we observe first that there [in the second covenant] neither the end nor the duration [of the exile] are alluded to, and that He did not assure us of redemption [i.e., promising that it would take place at a certain future time as was the case with the Babylonian captivity, whose end was foretold as a definite event in our section here in Leviticus as explained above], but He made it dependent upon [our] repentance. Neither did He mention among the sins [for which they would be exiled that] they would make any Asherim and sun-images, or that they would worship any idols whatsoever. Rather, He said, <i>But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the Eternal thy G-d, to observe to do all His commandments and His statutes</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">108</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 28:15.</i> thus stating that because they will transgress some of His commandments, and will not keep and observe all of them,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">133</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., they will “transgress” some of the negative commandments and “not keep and observe” the positive commandments.</i> they would be punished. Such indeed was the case during the Second Temple, just as the Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">134</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yoma 9 b.</i> “Why was the First Temple destroyed? Because of idolatry, immorality and bloodshed. But the Second Temple, of which we know that they [the people of that period], were engaged in the study of Torah and the practice of loving kindness, why was it destroyed? It was because of the causeless enmity which was among them.” Neither does He mention there [in the covenant in the Book of Deuteronomy] the Sanctuary, or “the pleasing odor” [of the offerings], as He mentioned here,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">135</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 31.</i> because the [Heavenly] fire did not come down and consume the offerings [that were brought] in the Second Temple, as the Rabbis testified there in Tractate Yoma.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">136</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yoma 21 b. Thus, as it were, there never was a “pleasing odor” in the days of the Second Temple which could be removed at its destruction.</i> And He further states there among the imprecations, <i>The Eternal will bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth, as the vulture swoops down</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">137</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 28:49.</i> alluding to the coming upon them of the Romans, who were very far from them. Thus He states there, <i>a nation that thou hast not known;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">138</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 36.</i> <i>a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">137</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 28:49.</i> because of their great distance from our Land. Such is not the case concerning the words of this covenant [before us], for [it speaks of the time when] they were exiled to Babylon and Assyria, which are near to [our] Land, and they always warred with them;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">139</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Therefore, the verse in Deuteronomy 28:49 [<i>The Eternal will bring a nation … from the end of the earth …</i>] could not apply to the period of the First Temple, as their warring enemies were nearby. The case was far different during the Second Temple when the Romans came from far-off Italy.</i> and the stock of Israel comes from there, and they [the Jews] knew their language, as it is said, <i>Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Aramean language, for we understand it</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">140</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Kings 18:26.</i> Similarly, the verse stating [there in the Book of Deuteronomy], <i>And the Eternal shall scatter thee among all peoples, from the one end of the earth unto the other</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">141</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 28:64.</i> is [a reference to] our exile today, in which we are scattered from one end of the world to the other. Again He stated [there], <i>And the Eternal shall bring thee back into Egypt in ships</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">142</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 68.</i> and this happened in our [present] exile, when Titus filled the ships with them [captives], as it is written in the books of the Romans.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">143</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Reference is to the book of Josippon, Chapter 95. See Vol. I, p. 604, Note 249.</i> Similarly, that which Scripture says there, <i>Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people and thy eyes shall see;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">144</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 28:32.</i> <i>Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, and they shall not be thine, for they shall go into captivity</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">145</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 41. Ramban’s illuminating comment on these verses (see following text) brings to light the ruthless cruelty of the Romans at the destruction of the Second Temple, when they deported all the young and only “the fathers [i.e. the old] remained in the Land.”</i> — these are not references to the [Babylonian] exile, when both fathers and sons were exiled, but [refer] to that captivity of the sons alone [following the destruction of the Second Temple by the Romans], when the fathers remained in the Land. Such is not stated in the first covenant, because the exile [which it speaks of] was a complete one [for both fathers and sons], but it is mentioned in the second covenant, because the Romans ruled in our Land and took the sons and daughters at their will. Similarly, [the verse stating], <i>Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemy whom the Eternal shall send against thee in hunger, and in thirst</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">146</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 48.</i> is a reference to our servitude when we were subject to the Romans in our Land, and their officers ruled over us, pressing upon us a heavy yoke and taking away our people and our wealth, as is known in the [history] books. Another proof [that the covenant in the Book of Deuteronomy refers to the exile after the destruction of the Second Temple] is that He said, <i>The Eternal will bring thee, and thy king whom thou shalt set over thee, unto a nation that thou hast not known, thou nor thy fathers</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">147</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 36.</i> for King Agrippa<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">148</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This was Agrippa II, a loyal servant of Rome. He was the last king of Judea. During the siege of Jerusalem he was with Titus, and following the fall of the city he took part in arranging the Roman triumphal celebrations in Caesarea! He was the opposite of his father King Agrippa I, who in his genuine attachment to the Jewish people and religion won the love of all classes of the people.</i> went to Rome at the end of the [period of the] Second Temple, and on account of his going there the Temple was destroyed.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">149</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban here is referring to Josippon Chapter 65, where it is narrated that “King Agrippa went to Nero, emperor of Rome, and told him all these things [concerning the Jewish uprising against Rome], whereupon Nero sent against the Jews the Roman general etc.” This was the beginning of the war which culminated in the fall of Jerusalem.</i> Now Scripture does not state: “the king who will rule over thee,” but it says, <i>thy king whom ‘thou shalt set’</i>. Thus He, blessed be He, is hinting to us that he [that ruler] was not fit to be king, since he was forbidden to be king over Israel according to the law of the Torah [as he was a descendant of King Herod, the son of Antipater the Idumean, and Scripture states, <i>thou mayest not put a foreigner over thee, who is not thy brother</i>],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">150</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 17:15.</i> but they “set up” him and his fathers as kings over them against the law, as is mentioned in Tractate Sotah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">151</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sotah 41 b.</i><br>Now all the hints such as these clearly indicate that the meaning of this matter is this our [present] exile, and the redemption [mentioned] in this second covenant, which will be a complete redemption, superior to all [preceding ones]. Thus He said, <i>And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the blessing and the curse</i> etc.;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">152</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 30:1.</i> and He promised, <i>And He will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">153</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 5.</i> this being a promise to all the tribes of Israel, not [merely] to one-sixth<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">154</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, which constitute one-sixth of the twelve tribes. Ramban is thus stating that the redemption from the Babylonian exile was not a complete redemption, since the return consisted mainly of two tribes [with small groups of the other tribes, see above Note 124]. But the Divine promise stated in Deuteronomy 30:5 [as mentioned here in the text] refers to <i>all</i> tribes of Israel. Hence the coming redemption will be more complete than all preceding ones.</i> of the people; and there He promised [also] that He would cut down and destroy those who caused our exile, as it is said, <i>And the Eternal thy G-d will put all these curses upon thine enemies, and on them that hate thee, that persecuted thee</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">155</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 7.</i> the expressions, <i>thine enemies</i> and <i>those that hate thee</i> alluding to the two nations<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">156</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A reference to the two dominant religions in Ramban’s times — that of Edom and Ishmael — which persecuted the Jews [and still continue to do so] in countless ways.

Now these words [<i>And He will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">153</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 5.</i>] assure us of the coming redemption with a more perfect assurance than all the visions of Daniel.<br>Similarly, that which He stated here, <i>and your enemies that shall dwell therein shall be desolate in it</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">157</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 32.</i> constitutes a good tiding, proclaiming that during all our exiles, our Land will not accept our enemies. This also is a great proof and assurance to us, for in the whole inhabited part of the world one cannot find such a <i>good and large Land</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">158</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 3:8.</i> which was always lived in and yet is as ruined as it is [today],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">159</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When these words were written — sometime after the middle of the thirteenth century — the Land of Israel had just experienced the Mongolian invasion (of 1259-60), which following upon the constant wars of the Crusaders, left the country in total ruin.</i> for since the time that we left it, it has not accepted any nation or people, and they all try to settle it, but to no avail.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">160</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A clear reference to the many nations that have tried — and failed — to cultivate the Land of Israel since the Jews were driven from it by the Romans. This indubitable historical fact is, as Ramban correctly points out, “a great proof” that the Land belongs to Israel. Witness also the miraculous response of the Land since the recent return of the Jews to its borders.</i><br>Now the first covenant mentioned in this section the Holy One, blessed be He, made, for His Great Name was indeed with us in the First Temple, and the second covenant in the section of <i>V’hayah Ki Thavo</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">161</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 26:1. — The covenant referred to is <i>ibid.</i>, 28:1-68.</i> expressed by the mouth of Moses, alludes to the removal of his Divine Presence entirely, since in the Second Temple only the Glory of His Name was present, as it is said, <i>and I will take pleasure in it</i> i.e., the Second Temple] <i>‘v’ikavdah’</i> (<i>and I will be glorified</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">162</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Haggai 1:8.</i> The additional letter <i>hei</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">163</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word <i>v’ikavdah</i> is in this instance actually written <i>without</i> the <i>hei</i> at the end.

Hence his language: “the ‘additional’ <i>hei</i>” …</i> alludes to the second <i>hei</i> in the Great Name [i.e., the Tetragrammaton — which refers to the Glory of His Name].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">164</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Abusaula. — Thus the verse establishes that in the Second Temple there was the Glory of His Name.

The correct interpretation appears to me to be that He is stating: “<i>And I will bring them into the land of their enemies, o</i> (either) until such time when <i>their uncircumcised heart will be humbled, o</i> (or) until the time when <i>they will have been paid the punishment of their iniquity</i> by the length of the exile.”<br>Now it is after [the verse], <i>and they shall confess their iniquity</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">167</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 40.</i> that He should have said, <i>Then will I remember My covenant with Jacob</i> etc.,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">168</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 42.</i> for what reason is there [to state here, between these two verses] <i>and I will bring them into the lands of their enemies</i>, since this is not a time when He would exile them and bring them into the lands of their enemies [since they have just confessed their sins]! Therefore Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra interpreted [the verse to mean]: “This also I did with them, that I punished them by bringing them into the land of their enemies in order to humble their uncircumcised heart.” And He mentioned this here [in order to indicate] that they confessed their sin “because it was I Who brought this about, for even at the time that they became corrupted, My intent was that they should repent and confess.”<br>In my opinion He hints here [by placing the verses in this order] that [even] after the confession [of their sins], He will walk contrary to them and will still bring them into the land of their enemies until their uncircumcised heart is humbled, this being an allusion that He will bring them back into the Land but it will not be subdued before them; rather, they will have adversaries and enemies there, as it is said, <i>And our adversaries said;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">169</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nehemiah 4:5.</i> <i>And it came to pass when our enemies heard</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">170</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 9.</i> The Land [at that time, when they returned from Babylon], was in the hands of foreign peoples, just as Ezra said in his prayer: <i>Behold, we are servants this day, and as for the Land that Thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold we are servants in it.

It cannot refer to [the firstling of] an ass, since the [animal given in] redemption of an ass is only a lamb<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">196</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 13:13.</i> [while here the animal is to be redeemed <i>according to thy valuation</i>, i.e., as you wish], and [moreover the lamb given in redemption of a firstling ass is a] gift to the priest, and is not given to the Temple treasury [as is stated here]. Rather, the verse refers to something dedicated to the Temple treasury [and is a continuation of Verse 11], for above [in Verse 11] He spoke about redeeming a [dedicated] animal which is fit to be eaten and which became blemished [thus disqualifying it as an offering], and here [in the verse before us] He speaks of a case where one dedicated for Temple repairs an animal which is not permitted to be eaten, [or offered up].” Thus far the language of Rashi.<br>It is possible that we answer [Rashi’s argument as to why this verse cannot be referring to the redemption of this firstling of an ass, and that we do interpret it as referring to such a case, by saying] that because He stated [in the preceding verse], <i>Only the firstborn of the beasts, which is born as a firstling to the Eternal, no man shall sanctify it</i>, therefore He reverted [to this subject] and stated [in the verse before us] that if the firstling that he sanctified be of an animal that is forbidden to be eaten, <i>then he shall ransom it according to thy valuation</i>, explaining that [the law of] the firstling does not apply to forbidden animals, except for the firstling of an ass, the law of which has already been explained.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">196</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 13:13.</i> Thus He taught [here] that even if a person did dedicate it, its sanctity is not like that of the law of a [permitted] firstling [which can never be redeemed], but it is like anything else which is dedicated to the Temple treasury, and it may be redeemed. Therefore He stated [here] that he who dedicated it redeems it by adding one-fifth [to its actual value], whereas another person may redeem it <i>according to thy valuation</i> [without the additional one-fifth]. And the verse above [11] stating, <i>And if it be any unclean beast, of which they may not bring an offering</i>, refers, according to the plain meaning of Scripture, to an animal that may not be eaten [not to the firstling of an ass, which has been dedicated to the Temple treasury]. According to the interpretation of our Rabbis,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">197</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Temurah 32 b.</i> there is a redundant expression in that verse [11 above], since He repeated <i>an unclean beast, of which they may not bring an offering to the Eternal</i> [it being self-understood that an offering may not be brought from an animal that may not be eaten]. Therefore the Rabbis interpreted it as follows: “<i>and if it be any unclean beast</i>, or [if it be] <i>of which they may not bring an offering unto the Eternal</i>,” thus including [permitted] animals which have become permanently blemished, of which offerings may not be brought [and thus if they were dedicated to the Temple treasury, the law stated in the verse is to be applied]."

                    "NONE DOOMED WHO SHALL BE DOOMED OF MAN, SHALL BE REDEEMED. “[This means that] if a person is about to be executed [by the court], and someone else says, ‘I take upon myself to pay his valuation [to the Temple treasury],’ his vow is of no effect.” HE SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH. “For you see he is going to die. Therefore he is not to be redeemed; he has neither a market-price nor a fixed valuation” [as fixed by the Torah on the basis of his age]. This is Rashi’s language. But our Rabbis have differed on this matter, some saying<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">198</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Arakhin 6 b. The name of the Sage holding this opinion is Rabbi Yishmael.</i> that it constitutes an admonition in connection with those who are liable to the death-penalty, that one must not take a ransom from them in order to free them. It is possible that He mentions this admonition here in order to state that he [the condemned] cannot give money to [the Temple of] G-d as other devoted things [are given], and thereby go free of punishment.<br>By way of the plain meaning of Scripture, the verse is stating that whatever a man devotes of his belongings, whether man or animal or field of his possession, <i>it is holy unto the Eternal</i>, meaning that they become devoted things of the priests, and there is no redemption for them. But if he devotes people who are not his, such as those who go to war against their enemies and utter a vow, <i>If Thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then will I utterly destroy their cities</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">199</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 21:2.</i> then all the people found in them are to die. The reason for this is that the intention of those making such a vow is not that [the captives] be given to the priests, but rather that it be forbidden to derive any benefit from them, since their purpose is to utterly destroy the enemies. Thus we find in the case of the men of Jabesh-gilead who transgressed the oath of the assembly by not coming to Mitzpah [to take part in the battle against Gibeah for the outrage they had committed],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">200</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Judges Chapter 19.</i> that it is written, <i>And the congregation sent thither ten thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them saying: ‘Go and smite the inhabitants with the edge of the sword’</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">201</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 21:10.</i> And common sense does not allow [us to say] that the whole congregation perpetrated such an evil deed, killing many people of Israel who were not guilty of death! And Phinehas was there,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">202</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 20:28.</i> and by word of his mouth the whole affair was done! I have further found in the Agadah, in the [Midrash] Yelamdeinu:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">203</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I have found this in the Yalkut Shimoni, <i>Shoftim</i> 76. On “Yelamdeinu” see in <i>Seder Bo</i> (Vol. II, p. 131, Note 196).</i> “We have been taught: Rabbi Akiba says, <i>Cheirem</i> (‘doomed to destruction’) is an oath, and an oath is <i>cheirem</i>. The men of Jabesh transgressed the <i>cheirem</i>, and thus they became liable to the death penalty.”<br>Therefore I say that it was from this verse [before us] that they deduced this law — that if any king of Israel, or the Great Sanhedrin [of seventy-one judges] in the presence of all Israel, who have the authority to institute ordinances [for the good of the people], if they declare a certain city <i>cheirem</i>, to be warred on, and likewise if they declare a certain matter <i>cheirem</i>, he who violates it is liable to the death-penalty. This indeed was the guilt of the men of Jabesh-gilead [as mentioned above], and of Jonathan, to whom his father [Saul] had said, <i>‘G-d do so and more also, thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">204</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 14:44.</i> Now on the basis of what legal authority did these people deserve death, if not because of this source [in Scripture]?<br>And this was the mistake that Jephthah made with his daughter.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">205</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Judges 11:30-34, where it is related that Jephthah vowed <i>that whosoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it shall be the Eternal’s, and I will offer it up as a burnt-offering</i>, and it was his daughter who came out to meet him first.</i> For he thought that just as a <i>cheirem</i> [“doomed” object] of the chief of Israel is valid and takes effect to put [certain] people to death, and [also] anyone who transgresses it is liable to the death-penalty, so [Jephthah thought] that if he uttered a vow at a time of war, to make an offering of a certain person or persons, the vow is valid; but he did not know that a <i>cheirem</i> declared by the king and Sanhedrin is valid [only] regarding the destruction of rebels, or against one who transgresses their decrees and ordinances. But that a vow should take effect to make a burnt-offering of something not appropriate for G-d, [as Jephthah thought] — Heaven forbid! Therefore the Rabbis have said in Bereshith Rabbah<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">206</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Bereshith Rabbah 60:3.</i> that [Jephthah] was not even obliged to pay the price of her market-value to the Temple treasury [as his vow was totally invalid], and he was punished for her [innocent] blood!<br>Now do not let yourself be misled by Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra’s<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">207</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The source is unknown to me since we have no commentary of Ibn Ezra on the Book of Judges. This interpretation, however, is found in the commentary of Ralbag.</i> empty words, when he says that the meaning of the expression <i>and I will offer it up for a burnt-offering</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">208</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Judges 11:31.</i> is “or I will offer it up,” as if to say: “if that which comes forth of the doors of my house be a man or woman, that person shall be holy to G-d, inasmuch as he will abstain from the ways of the world, <i>to stand to minister in the Name of the Eternal</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">209</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 18:5.</i> in prayer and thanksgiving to G-d; but if it be something fit for an offering, I will make it a burnt-offering.” Accordingly [Ibn Ezra’s interpretation continues, since Jephthah’s daughter was the first to come out to meet her father], he built her a house outside the city where she resided in seclusion, and he provided her with sustenance all her days, <i>and no man knew her</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">210</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 24:16.</i> so that his daughter remained shut away [from the world all her life].<br>All this are words of emptiness. For if he vowed that [whatsoever comes forth of the door of his house] <i>shall be the Eternal’s</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">208</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Judges 11:31.</i> this does not mean that he should be a recluse [from the world], but instead he is to be like Samuel, of whom his mother said, <i>and I shall give him unto the Eternal</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">211</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 1:11.</i> and he was a servant in the House of G-d, not a recluse. And according to the ordinances of the Torah, no man can utter a vow which will bind the persons who come out of the door of his house to live thereafter in seclusion, just as he cannot bring them as an offering. And if the matter be so [as Ibn Ezra put it] then Jephthah’s daughter would be bewailing her virginity with her companions with her,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">212</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Judges 11:38.</i> like harlots enhancing their hire!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">213</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ezekiel 16:31.</i> Heaven forbid that this be a custom in Israel, <i>to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">214</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Judges 11:39-40. Ramban’s comment here is typical of Jewish teaching which abhors celibacy.</i> because she did not marry and she worshipped G-d in purity! Rather, this whole subject is to be understood in its plain meaning [that Jephthah actually brought her as an offering], and his mistake was as I have explained.<br>And according to the opinion of our Rabbis, of blessed memory, it is possible that this verse [before us] includes many [different] subjects, similar to the verse, <i>Ye shall not eat with the blood;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">215</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 19:26. See Ramban there.</i> and like the verse, <i>The fathers shall not be put to death for the children</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">216</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 24:16.</i> which the Rabbis interpret<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">217</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 27 b. The meaning of the verse is thus: a parent cannot be condemned on the evidence of his children.</i> as invalidating the testimony of relatives, and Scripture further states concerning it: <i>But the children of the murderers he</i> [King Amaziah of Judah] <i>put not to death, according to that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, as the Eternal commanded, saying, ‘The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers.’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">218</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Kings 14:6. Here it is obvious that the Rabbis also understood the verse in its literal sense — that children are not to be put to death for the sins of their parents, and vice versa.</i> Similarly this verse [before us] includes the law of one who vows to give to the Temple treasury the valuation of a person who is liable to the death-penalty [as explained above], the law of those against whom a <i>cheirem</i> is declared at a time of conquest, as we have said, and the law of one who transgresses the <i>cheirem</i> of the Great Court or of the king of Israel, as was the case in the incident of Saul [and Jonathan mentioned above]. It is with reference to that that it is said there, <i>So the people rescued Jonathan, that he die not</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">219</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 14:45.</i> for since the Torah states, <i>he shall not be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">220</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Verse 29 before us.</i> it says there, <i>So the people rescued Jonathan, that he die not;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">219</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 14:45.</i> [meaning] that since a miracle happened through him [i.e., that the Philistines suffered a great defeat on that day], they knew that it was in error that Jonathan had acted [contrary to the <i>cheirem</i> of his father]. And this is the sense of the expression [of the people in speaking on behalf of Jonathan], <i>who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">219</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 14:45.</i> And so likewise did Yonathan ben Uziel translate this expression: “For before the Eternal it is revealed that he [Jonathan] acted in error on that day, and so the people rescued Jonathan.”",
