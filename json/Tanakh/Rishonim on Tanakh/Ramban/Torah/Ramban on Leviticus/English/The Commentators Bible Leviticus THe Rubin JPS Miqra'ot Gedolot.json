                    "I made the Israelite people live in booths. Rashi's comment seems to me to be the straightforward sense of the verse. He has commanded that all future generations should know the deeds of the great God \"Who dealt so wondrously with you\" (Joel 2:26) sheltering them under the clouds of His Presence as in a booth. Having already explained that \"over the Tabernacle a cloud of the LORD rested by day, and fire would appear in it by night\" (Exodus 40:38), our verse needed only to say, \"I made the Israelite people live in booths\" - \"I made My Presence into clouds of glory as shelters to protect them.\" We find the same notion in Isaiah 4:5-6, \"The LORD will create over the whole shrine and meeting place of Mount Zion cloud by day and smoke with a glow of flaming fire by night. Indeed, over all the glory shall hand a canopy, which shall serve as a pavilion for shade from heat by day and as a shelter for protection against drenching rain.\" At the beginning of the dry season, we are commanded to remember the exodus by making Nisan the first month of the year, and by celebrating the festival of Passover; here, at the beginning of the rainy season, a further observance is commanded, in commemoration of the ongoing miracle that was done for them throughout their 40 years in the wilderness. According to the opinion that the phrase refers to actual booths, they did begin making them at the start of the rainy season because of the cold, as people do when they camp, and that is why our text commands that booths be made at this season. In that case, what the future generations are supposed to know is that they made their way in the wilderness and \"found no settled place\" (Psalms 107:4) for 40 years. But God was with them, and they \"lacked nothing\" (Deuteronomy 2:7)."
