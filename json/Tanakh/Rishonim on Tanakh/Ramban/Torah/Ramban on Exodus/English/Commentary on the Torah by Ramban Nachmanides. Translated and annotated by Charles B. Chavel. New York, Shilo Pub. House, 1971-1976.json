            "‘V’EILEH SHEMOTH’ (AND THESE ARE THE NAMES OF…)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew names for the books of the Bible are generally taken from the first words in the Hebrew text. Thus the name <i>“V’eileh Shemoth”</i> for this second book of the Torah, or just <i>“Shemoth,”</i> as it is now known. In the Talmud it is known as <i>Chomesh Sheini</i>, the “Second Fifth” of the five books of the Torah (Sotah 36 b). The English name Exodus stems from the Septuagint, the first Greek translation of the Bible, and is based on the fact that the first fifteen chapters deal with the exodus from Egypt.</i> In the Book of Genesis, which is the book of Creation, the Torah completed the account of how the world was brought forth from nothingness and how everything was created, as well as an account of all the events which befell the patriarchs, who are a sort of creation to their seed.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his commentary on the Book of Genesis, Ramban develops this theme at great length. See Index to Vol. I, p. 618, Patriarchs.</i> All the events that happened to them were symbolic occurrences, indicating and foretelling all that was destined to come upon their seed. After having completed the account of creation, the Torah begins another book concerning the subject that had been alluded to in those symbolic events [recorded in the Book of Genesis].",
            "The Book of V’eileh Shemoth was set apart for the story of the first exile,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Four exiles were decreed. The first one was in Egypt. See Index to Vol. I, p. 613, Exile.</i> which had been clearly decreed,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 15:13.</i> and the redemption therefrom. This is why He reverted and began [this second book of the Torah] with the names of those persons who went down to Egypt, and mentioned their total number,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Verse 5 here: <i>And all the souls … were seventy souls</i>.</i> although this had already been written.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 46:8-27.</i> It is because their descent thereto constituted the beginning of the exile, which began from that moment on.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The exile thus did not begin with the actual enslavement of the Israelites by the Egyptians; rather it started with their very descent into Egypt. Hence here at the beginning of the book of the exile, the Torah uses the same verse found in the Book of Genesis where the actual account of the descent is given, in order to indicate that the exile began at that point. See also Ramban on Genesis 46:2 (Vol. I, p. 553), where he alludes to this thought. Ramban makes further reference to it here in Verse 1.</i>",
            "Now the exile was not completed<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban is now aiming to explain why the second book of the Torah, which as explained above is the book of the first exile and the redemption therefrom, does not close with the actual exodus or with the Revelation on Sinai, but instead proceeds with the account of the building of the Tabernacle. Ramban’s answer is most illuminating and inspiring.</i> until the day they returned to their place<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Hosea 5:15.</i> and were restored to the status of their fathers. When they left Egypt, even though they came forth from the house of bondage, they were still considered exiles because they were <i>in a land that is not theirs</i>,.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 15:13.</i> entangled in the desert.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See further, 14:3.</i> When they came to Mount Sinai and made the Tabernacle, and the Holy One, blessed be He, caused His Divine Presence to dwell again amongst them, they returned to the status of their fathers when <i>the ‘sod eloka’ (counsel of G-d) was upon their tents</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Job 29:4, and Ramban’s commentary thereon, (in my Kithvei Haramban: Vol. I, p. 90), where he interprets the verse as follows: “Job is saying that <i>sod eloka</i> — the counsel of G-d - was known in his tent, as if He foretold all future events. Thus Job and all who were with him were guarded from mishaps and troubles. It may be that <i>sod eloka</i> is a reference to the angels of the Supreme One and the host of the heavens that dwelled upon his tent to guard him from all evil, etc.” Ramban is thus intimating here that the complete redemption of the Israelites from their first exile was not achieved until they were restored to the same position held by the patriarchs. Whereas the Divine Presence rested upon the tents of the patriarchs — see Shabbath 55b, where Rashi clearly states that before the building of the Tabernacle, the Divine Presence was to be found upon the tents of the righteous — so Israel regained its original status only when the Divine Glory came to rest upon the Tabernacle at the time of its completion. See end of Book of Exodus. It is for this reason that the second book of the Torah — devoted as it is to the first exile and the redemption therefrom — continues with the account of the building of the Tabernacle.</i> and “they were those who constituted the Chariot of the Holy One.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Bereshith Rabbah 47:8. See Vol. I, p. 224.</i> Then they were considered redeemed. It was for this reason that this second book of the Torah is concluded with the consummation of the building of the Tabernacle, and the glory of the Eternal filling it<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 40:35.</i> always.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 9:16: <i>So it was always: the cloud covered it…</i></i>"

                    "AND THESE ARE THE NAMES OF …. The meaning [of the connective <i>vav — v’eileh</i>, (‘and’ these are) — when it would have sufficed to say, “These are the names of …,”] is that Scripture desires to reckon the subject of the exile from the time they went down to Egypt. It was then that they were <i>the first of the exiles to go into exile</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Amos 6:7.</i> as I have explained.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Note 7 above.</i> It is for this reason that He returns to the beginning of the subject [stated in the Book of Genesis], which is the verse, <i>And all his seed he</i> [Jacob] <i>brought with him into Egypt</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 46:7.</i> There it is written afterward, <i>And these are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt</i>, etc.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 8.</i> This is the very same verse that He repeats here. Even though they are two separate books, the narrative is connected with subjects which follow one another successively. Here, once He mentioned the children of Jacob, He adopted a concise approach to his children’s children and all of his seed [and did not mention them by name as He had done in the Book of Genesis]. Rather, He alluded to them only generally, just as He had said there, <i>All the souls of the house of Jacob, that came into Egypt, were threescore and ten</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 27. In the same way He said here in Verse 5: <i>And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls</i>.</i><br>A similar case is found in the Book of Chronicles and the Book of Ezra. The Book of Chronicles finishes with the verse: <i>Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the Eternal by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the Eternal stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying: Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, etc</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Chronicles 36:22-23.</i> The author repeated the very language of these two verses at the beginning of the Book of Ezra in order to connect the narrative. However, since they were indeed two books, he completed the first book, [i.e., the Book of Chronicles], with the events that transpired before the building of the Second Sanctuary, and he devoted the second book, [i.e., the Book of Ezra], to the events that happened from the time of the building [of that Sanctuary].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban’s thesis apparently is that Ezra himself completely authored the two books, Chronicles and Ezra. See, however, Baba Bathra 15a, where it is stated, “Ezra wrote his book and the genealogy of Chronicles up to himself.” This would seem to indicate that only the first chapters of the Book of Chronicles, which deal with the genealogical tables, were written by Ezra, but not the other parts of the book. The key to the understanding of Ramban’s words must lie therefore in grasping his intent, i.e., that Ezra connected the Book of Chronicles with his own book by using the restoration-edict of Cyrus as the linking material, with the object of bringing out the continuity of the events during the two Sanctuaries.</i> The same thing occurs in these two books, Bereshith and V’eileh Shemoth.",
                    "Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra said that because He mentioned at the end of Bereshith [50:23] that Joseph <i>saw children of the third generation</i> to his children, this is why He mentioned [here in the second book] that his brethren likewise were at first few and then were fruitful and multiplied. But this is not correct.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban did not explain the reason for his rejection of Ibn Ezra’s interpretation. I found this in Isaac Abarbanel’s (1437-1508) Commentary on the Torah, where he offers the following explanation for Ramban’s rejection: “The reason for it is that in the Book of Genesis, the Torah has already mentioned each one of the twelve tribes, their children, and their children’s children, who went down into Egypt. And this is far more than the mere names of the tribes He mentioned here. Besides, it would have sufficed to say here, <i>And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly</i>, thus informing us of their great increase, and not just mentioning the names of the tribes. Moreover, in my opinion, if Ibn Ezra’s interpretation be correct, it would not have been necessary here to include Joseph as it did in Verse 5, since he had been mentioned already at the beginning of this topic, [i.e., at the end of the Book of Genesis]. Moreover, the division of the chapters refutes Ibn Ezra’s opinion.”</i><br>Rashi wrote: “Although Scripture had already enumerated them whilst they were living, it again enumerates them by name, following their death, in order to show how they were beloved by G-d. They are compared to the stars which G-d also brings out by number and brings in by number,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In our text of Rashi: “Which G-d also brings out and brings in by number and name.”</i> as it is said, <i>He bringeth out their host by number, He calleth them all by name</i>.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 40:26. “It is for this reason that He mentions the names of the tribes always and repeats them, all for the sake of showing how dear they are to G-d” (Bachya).</i> These are words of homiletic exposition,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shemoth Rabbah 1:3.</i> and insofar as they indicate the love of G-d for the tribes — how the Holy One, blessed be He, loves them and repeats their names always — they are words of truth. But the matters of the connection of the verses and how they are joined by the <i>vav</i> — [<i>v’eileh shemoth — (‘And’ these are the names of…)</i>] — is as I have explained."

Pharaoh and his wise counsellors<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Isaiah 19:11.</i> did not see fit to slay them by the sword, for it would have been a gross treachery to smite without reason a people that had come into the land by command of a former king.

Rather, Pharaoh said he would do it wisely so that the Israelites would not feel that it was done in enmity against them.<br>It is for this reason that he placed a levy upon them, as it was customary that strangers in a country contribute a levy to the king, as it is mentioned in the case of King Solomon.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Chronicles 2:16-17.</i> Afterwards he secretly commanded the midwives to kill the male children upon the birthstool<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 16.</i> so that even the mothers should not know it. Following that, <i>he charged all his people, Every son that is born, ye</i> — yourselves — <i>shall cast into the river</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 22.</i> Essentially, Pharaoh did not want to charge his executioners to slay them by the decree of the king or to cast them into the river. Rather, he said to the people that whoever would find a Jewish child should throw him into the river. Should the child’s father complain to the king or to the master of the city, they would tell him to bring witnesses and then they will exact vengeance [for the crime]. Now once the king’s restriction was removed,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, “And when the king’s strap was untied.” In other words, when the government’s restraint against murder was removed, the Egyptians, etc. Ramban thus traces through the verses the gradual disintegration of the Israelites’ right to life in ancient Egypt.</i> the Egyptians would search the houses, entering them at night, and indifferent [to the cries of the parents], would remove the children therefrom. It is therefore said, <i>And when she could no longer hide him</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 2:3.</i><br>It appears that this [decree to drown the Israelite children] lasted but a short time, for when Aaron was born [three years before Moses],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 7:7.</i> the decree was not yet in existence,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This would explain why his mother did not have to seek a way to preserve his life.</i> and when [shortly after] Moses was born, it appears that the decree was revoked. Perhaps it was through Pharaoh’s daughter, who, in her compassion for the child Moses, said to her father that he should not act in that way. It may be that when it became known that this decree was enacted by the king, he revoked it, or again it may be that it was revoked on account of the astrologers, as is the opinion of the Rabbis,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“When Moses was thrown into the waters, the astrologers said to Pharaoh, ‘Their deliverer has already been cast into the waters.’ Immediately, they voided the decree” (Shemoth Rabbah 1:29). See also Rashi to Verse 22 here.</i> since it was all done dexterously by them in order that the crime not be known. This is the meaning of the complaint made to Moses our teacher [by the officers of the children of Israel], <i>Ye have made our savor to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 5:21.</i> meaning, “Now they will increase their hatred of us and find justification for saying that we rebel against the government, and they will then openly slay us by the sword without the necessity of doing it slyly.”",

Thus it is as if Scripture wrote, ‘And <i>we</i> shall have to go up out of the land, and they will possess it.’” These are the words of Rashi. But if the explanation is as the Rabbi has it, [i.e., that the Israelites will go up to wage war against the Egyptians], Scripture would have said, “And he will go up <i>al</i> (against) the land,” [instead of saying <i>min ha’aretz</i> (<i>out</i> of the land)]. Such is the correct expression concerning warriors: <i>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up ‘al’ (against) all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban here combined two verses: II Kings 24:1 and 18:13.</i><i>; Rezin the king of Aram… went up to Jerusalem to war ‘aleha’ (against it)</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 7:1.</i> Perhaps [Rashi will explain it by] saying that the meaning is that “he will come up against us from the land wherein he dwells,” meaning the land of Goshen.<br>It is possible to explain that Pharaoh is saying that “if wars will occur, the Israelites may join forces with our enemies <i>to take the spoil, and to take the prey</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 10:6.</i> They will get themselves up out of this land to the land of Canaan with all our belongings, and we will not be able to wreak our vengeance on them nor to war against them.” This is similar to the verses: <i>that brought us up out of the land of Egypt;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 32:1.</i> <i>that brought up and that led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all the countries whither I had driven them</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 23:8.</i> Similarly, the verse, <i>And they shall appoint themselves one head, and shall go up out of the land</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hosea 2:2.</i> means they shall appoint over themselves a captain and they shall go up to their land out of the country in which they had been exiled."

                    "SAREI MISIM’ (OFFICERS OF THE TRIBUTE) TO AFFLICT THEM. Pharaoh imposed a tribute upon the Israelite people to take men from them for the king’s projects. He appointed Egyptian officers over the tribute to take men at will in turns to serve for a month or more in the royal building-projects and the rest of the days [they remained] at home. These officers commanded the Israelites to build cities for Pharaoh, and the people built storage-cities for Pharaoh through this levy. When the Egyptians saw that this forced labor did not harm the Israelites, they were in dread for their own lives<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 12.</i> on account of them. They decreed that all Egyptians force the Israelites to serve them,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 13.</i> so that any Egyptian who needed work done had the authority to take from them men to do his work. This is the meaning of the verse, <i>And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 13.</i><br>They furthermore decreed against them that they do hard work <i>in mortar and in brick</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 14. Ramban now proceeds to show how <i>all</i> the Israelites — not only those forced into labor for the king’s building-projects — were afflicted. It is necessary to recall the full text: <i>And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor. And they made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field; in all their service, wherein they made them serve with rigor</i> (Verses 13-14). Ramban understands the term “Egyptians” here as referring to the whole population. Further in the text, Ramban will suggest another interpretation.</i> Whereas at first the officers would give them the bricks and the men of the forced labor would erect the buildings, they now conscripted the entire Israelite people into the work, commanding them to bring the earth, make the mortar with their hands and feet while only the straw was given to them from the king’s house, and give the bricks to the men of the forced labor engaged in the construction of the buildings. Every other manner of hard service in the field for Pharaoh and the Egyptians — such as excavations and the removal of dung — were all imposed upon them. In addition, they subjugated them, pressing them not to rest while beating and cursing them. This is the sense of the expression, <i>in all their service, wherein they made them serve with rigor</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 14. Ramban now proceeds to show how <i>all</i> the Israelites — not only those forced into labor for the king’s building-projects — were afflicted.

                    "AND THERE WENT A MAN OF THE HOUSE OF LEVI. Our Rabbis have said<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sotah 12a.</i> that he went after the advice of his daughter.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Amram and Jochebed, Moses’ parents, had been married previously. The children of that union were Miriam and Aaron. “When Pharaoh decreed that the male children of the Hebrews be killed, Amram separated from his wife, and his example was followed by all of the Israelites. Miriam then told her father that his decree is worse than that of the king. ‘Pharaoh decreed only against the male children, while you include the girls as well. It is doubtful if the decree of wicked Pharaoh will persist, while you are a righteous man and your enactment will surely be upheld by G-d.’ Upon recognizing the justice of her plea, Amram remarried his wife, and the men who had previously followed his example also remarried” (Sotah 12 b). It is this episode which the verse suggests by saying, <i>And there went a man</i>, i.e., “went” after the advice of his daughter and remarried his divorced wife. See also further on in the text for a reference to a prophecy Miriam made at that time.</i> Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra said that the Israelites dwelled in many cities, and this woman Jochebed lived in another city. [This would explain the term “went” in the above verse, i.e., he <i>went</i> to another city for his wife.] But what need is there for Scripture to mention this?<br>In my opinion Scripture uses the term “went” because this man paid no heed to Pharaoh’s decree and took to himself a woman to beget children. Such is Scripture’s way of speaking of anyone who prompts himself to do something new. Thus: <i>And Reuben went and lay with Bilhah;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 35:22.</i> <i>So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hosea 1:3.

At this point, Scripture desires to shorten the subject until the birth of the redeemer takes place, and after that, in the second <i>seder</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., in <i>Seder Va’eira</i>. (<i>A seder</i> is the weekly portion of the Torah read in the synagogue at the Sabbath morning services.) Specifically, Moses’ genealogy is found in <i>Seder Va’eira</i>, Chapter 6, Verses 16-20.</i> He traced the genealogy even of other tribes<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Reuben and Simeon. (<i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 14-15).</i> on account of Moses.<br>In line with the simple meaning of Scripture, i.e., that this was a first marriage [and not a remarriage as stated above], there is no significance in its being mentioned earlier or later in the chapter. This marriage took place before Pharaoh’s decree [that all male Hebrew children be killed], and she gave birth to Miriam and Aaron. After that, Pharaoh decreed, <i>Every son that is born, ye shall cast into the river</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 1:22.</i> and then she gave birth to this goodly son Moses. Scripture did not mention the birth of Miriam and Aaron inasmuch as there was nothing new about them. However, in the opinion of our Rabbis,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sotah 12a.</i> this was a remarriage, since Amram separated from his wife in consequence of Pharaoh’s decree and then took her back on account of his daughter’s prophecy.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Miriam prophesied, “My mother is destined to bear a son who will deliver Israel” (Sotah 13 a).</i> He made her a wedding and placed her in the litter, while Miriam and Aaron danced about them in their joy<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\">So clearly stated in Sotah 12a.</i> because through this marriage, Israel would be redeemed [from Egypt]. Even though Aaron was young<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He could have been no more than two years old since he was but three years older than Moses, and Moses was born after the second marriage.</i> [at that time], G-d put gladness in his heart for this occasion, or possibly his sister Miriam taught him."

It is a known fact that all mothers love their children, goodly or ungoodly, and all of them would hide them [from harm] with all their might. There is thus no need for Scripture to explain <i>that he was goodly</i>.

Hence, in accordance with Rabbi Yehudah’s opinion in Sotah 12 b, Rashi construed that he was a child with the voice of a young lad.</i> Thus the language of Rabbeinu Shlomo. Now the Rabbis have already rejected this opinion, saying,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the opinion of Rabbi Nechemya (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> “If so, you have made Moses our teacher appear as having a blemish [and being unfit for Levitical service in the Tabernacle].”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Part of the Levitical services in the Tabernacle — and later in the Sanctuary in Jerusalem — consisted of the chanting of the services. A Levite who had no sweetness of voice was disqualified for this service. (See Maimonides’ The Commandments, Vol. I, pp. 32-3, Soncino.) Now if as an infant, Moses, who was a Levite, already had a voice like that of a young lad, as he grew older his voice must have thickened. After the building of the Tabernacle when he was past eighty, his voice naturally could no longer be a singer’s voice, as it would have been greatly out of proportion to his age.</i> Besides, what reason is there for Scripture to mention his unnatural voice?<br>And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra said that his limbs were developed as that of a young lad. Perhaps Scripture mentioned this in order to denote the child’s beauty. It was due to his exquisite beautiful appearance that she [the princess] had compassion for him since she recognized that he had been recently born and yet his limbs were well-developed like those of a lad.<br>A more correct interpretation is that his was a strong and unrelenting cry like that of a lad, and therefore she had compassion for him. A homiletic exposition has it:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">72</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shemoth Rabbah 1:28.</i> “<i>A weeping lad</i>. He was a child whose behavior was that of a lad [who is not prone to crying]. At that moment, the angel Gabriel came and struck him so that he would cry and she would be compassionate towards him.”<br>In my opinion there is no need for all this.

At that time, Ishmael was seventeen years old. (See Ramban, Vol. I, p. 270, and Note 329, <i>ibid.</i>). Yet he is called <i>yeled</i>.</i> Similarly, <i>‘v’hana’ar na’ar’ (and the lad was young)</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">76</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 1:24. That Samuel was but a child at that time is explained by Ramban in the text, and yet Scripture refers to him as a <i>na’ar</i>.</i> meaning that he [Samuel] was a young child of twenty-four months. As soon as she [his mother, Hannah] had weaned him, she brought him up to Shiloh, as it is written, <i>And she gave her son suck until she weaned him.

The astrologers had said to the king, “Today the deliverer of the Hebrews has been born, and we do not know whether he is born of an Egyptian father or of an Israelite.” Therefore the decree on that day applied to all children. In accordance with that opinion, it is logical to assume that she examined the child, and only then did she come to the conclusion that he was a Hebrew. This is the basis of the opinion of Rabbi Yosei the son of Rabbi Chanina (see preceding Note), i.e., that she knew he was a Hebrew because she saw that he was circumcised.</i>"

The Hebrew who saw him doing that reckoned that Moses had caused [the Egyptian’s death somehow, even though he did not know that he had killed him by pronouncing the Tetragrammaton].

At the end [of that period], the king of Egypt died, and the Divine Revelation concerning it came to Moses and he was returned to Egypt and redeemed the children of Israel. It is for this reason that Scripture does not say, “and it came to pass <i>after</i> many days,” for the purport of that would have been that [the death of the king of Egypt] occurred long after Moses dwelt in Midian.

When they unite, Israel is remembered for help and redemption. This is explicitly referred to in the second half of the verse: <i>in wrath remember compassion</i>.</i> It is for this reason that Scripture gives this lengthy account — [<i>And G-d saw the children of Israel, and G-d knew</i>] — after already having mentioned, <i>And G-d heard… and G-d remembered</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">127</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 24.</i> This verse, [<i>And G-d saw…</i>,] has been explained in the Midrash of Rabbi Nechunya ben Hakanah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">134</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Also called Sefer Habahir.

Besides, they themselves will listen to any one on this matter — for what man is there who would not want to go out from unparalleled cruel bondage — but they will not give heed to go up to the land of Canaan.” Such indeed was the case. The war against those nations [in the land of Canaan] was hard on them from beginning to end, and they feared it while still in Egypt and later when they were in the desert. This then was the fear of Moses our teacher, of Pharaoh, and his apprehension of the children of Israel.<br>And the Eternal answered him on both matters. He said to him: “Do not fear Pharaoh for <i>I will be with thee</i> to save thee. <i>And this shall be the token unto thee</i> for the people <i>that I have sent thee</i> to them, for <i>when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve G-d upon this mountain</i>.

Sarah was taken out from Pharaoh’s house <i>with great plagues</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">198</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 12:17.</i> and Abraham alone subdued the great kings<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">199</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 14:14-15.</i> — all with the help of <i>E-il Sha-dai</i>, the Divine Name known to the patriarchs,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">200</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 6:3.</i> and so likewise He would do to their descendants. Moreover, Jacob had said, <i>And ‘Elokim’ (G-d) will be with you, and bring you back unto the land of your fathers</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">201</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 48:21.</i>, and Joseph also said, <i>‘Elokim’ (G-d) will surely remember you</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">202</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 50:25.</i> Thus the remembrance is by <i>Elokim!</i><br>In my opinion, Moses even at that time was already the father of wisdom, great in achievement of the heights of prophecy, and inherent in his question was the request that He inform him Who is sending him, that is to say, by what Divine attribute is he sent to the Israelites, just as Isaiah said, <i>And now the Eternal G-d hath sent me, and His spirit</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">203</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 48:16.</i> Thus Moses said: “They will ask me concerning my mission whether it is with the attribute of <i>E-il Sha-dai</i> which stood by the patriarchs, or with the high attribute of mercy with which You will do signs and wonders which will be new phenomena in creation.” [Moses was obliged to ask] this question because He had said to him, <i>I am the G-d of thy father, the G-d of Abraham</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">204</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 6.</i> and He did not elucidate to him at all any of His sacred Names. Moses then heard that He assured him of the Revelation on Mount Sinai and the Giving of the Torah, and he knew that the Torah would not be given with the Name of <i>E-il Sha-dai</i> mentioned in connection with the patriarchs, but would be given with the Great Name with which the world came into existence. Therefore he asked, <i>What shall I say unto them?</i><br>Our Rabbis have alluded to this interpretation. Thus they said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">205</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shemoth Rabbah 3:6.</i> <i>“And Moses said unto G-d, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel.”</i> Rabbi Shimon related in the name of Rabbi Simon that Moses said: ‘I am destined to become the agent between Thee and them when Thou wilt give them the Torah and say unto them, <i>I am the Eternal thy G-d</i>.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">206</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 20:2. “And if I am worthy to become Thy agent at the Giving of the Torah, I request to be informed now of Thy Great Name” (Eitz Yoseph to Shemoth Rabbah). This conclusion is here implied and is so clearly stated at the end of the Midrash here quoted.</i><br>“<i>And I shall say unto them: The G-d of your fathers hath sent me unto you</i>. At that moment, Moses desired to be elucidated concerning his activities, for he feared lest the children of Israel ask him, <i>What is His name? What shall I say unto them?</i> At that moment Moses desired that the Holy One, blessed be He, inform him of the Great Name, [i.e., the Tetragrammaton].” This was the purport of Moses’ question.",
                    "And G-d answered him, “‘I WILL BE THAT WHICH I WILL BE.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">207</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 14.</i> I will be with you<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">208</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“You.” In our version of Rashi: “them.”</i> in this sorrow, and I will be with you<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">208</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“You.” In our version of Rashi: “them.”</i> in other sorrows.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">209</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“In other sorrows.” In our version of Rashi: “In the subjection [they will suffer at the hands] of the other kingdoms.”</i> Thereupon Moses said to Him, ‘Master of the universe!

See Torah Shleimah by Rabbi M. Kasher, paragraph 188.</i> “And what is the meaning of I WILL BE THAT WHICH I WILL BE? ‘As you are with Me, so I am with you. If they open their hands and give charity, I also will open My hand, as it is said, <i>The Eternal will open unto thee His good treasure the heaven to give the rain of thy land in its season</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">216</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 28:12.</i> And if they do not open their hands, what is written there? <i>Behold, He withholdeth the waters, and they dry up</i>.’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">217</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 12:15.</i><br>In a similar vein the Rabbis expounded:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">218</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shemoth Rabbah 3:6.</i> “Rabbi Yitzchak said that the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses: ‘I am He Who has been, Who is now, and Who will be in the future.’ This is why <i>Eh’yeh</i> is written here three times.” The explanation of Rabbi Yitzchak’s opinion is that since with respect to the Creator, past and future times are conceived completely in terms of the present — for there is no host succeeding host with regards to Him, and nothing of His time has passed — hence all times with reference to Him are called by one name, signifying a Being Whose existence is absolute.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">219</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Or “a Being Who is necessarily existent.” “G-d alone is that Being, for His existence is absolute — existence and essence are perfectly identical. He is not a substance to which existence is joined as an accident, as an additional element. His existence is always absolute, and has never been a new element or an accident in Him” (Moreh Nebuchim, I, 57, Friedlander’s translation).</i><br>Now Onkelos translated the first two names, [i.e. <i>‘Eh’yeh Asher Eh’yeh’</i>], as “I will be with him that I will be,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">220</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The meaning thereof is further elucidated by Ramban. In our version of Onkelos, these two Divine Names are also not translated and instead are retained in their original Hebrew form.</i> but he did not translate the third name <i>Eh’yeh</i> expressed in the verse, <i>Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel: ‘Eh’yeh’ hath sent me unto you</i>. It appears that Onkelos’ opinion is that <i>the glorious Name</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">221</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 28:58.</i> of which He informed Moses was this four-letter Name of which He commanded him, <i>Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel: ‘Eh’yeh’ hath sent me unto you</i>. But He first informed him of the purport thereof, for Moses’ request had been to know the ways of G-d through His Name, just as he was once again to request [later on]: <i>Let me know Thy ways, that I may know Thee</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">222</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 33:13.</i> And just as He answered him then, <i>And I will proclaim the name of the Eternal before thee, and I will be gracious unto whom I will be gracious</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">223</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 19.</i> — meaning that with <i>this glorious Name</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">221</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 28:58.</i> which He will proclaim before him, He will be gracious and will show mercy, and no man can fathom the profundity of His ways — in the same vein He said to him now: “I will be with him that I will be,” meaning, “with My Name that you will tell them, namely, <i>Eh’yeh</i>, with that Name I am gracious and show mercy to man.”<br>And the Gaon Rav Saadia wrote<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">224</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his Arabic translation of, and commentary on, the Torah. So clearly mentioned by Rabbi Abraham the son of Rambam in his commentary (Wiesenberg ed., London, 1958, p. 226). See Index in my Kithvei Haramban, Vol. II, p. 564, under <i>lashon</i>, for Ramban’s extensive use of Arabic. In view then of the fact that Ibn Ezra does not mention this interpretation of Rav Saadia Gaon in his commentary, nor is it found in Saadia’s philosophic work Emunoth Vehadei’oth, it may be assumed that Ramban saw it in the original Arabic.</i> that its explanation is as follows: “[He is the Being] Whose existence has never ceased and will never cease, for He is the first and the last.” The opinion of the Gaon is not far from the opinion of Rabbi Yitzchak, [i.e., that the name <i>Eh’yeh</i> indicates eternity, as explained above].<br>And the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] has said in the Moreh Nebuchim (Guide of the Perplexed)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">225</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Part I, Chapter 63. In Friedlander’s translation: p. 239.</i> that the meaning of <i>Eh’yeh Asher Eh’yeh</i> is: “He is the existing Being which is the existing Being, that is to say, Whose existence is absolute. The proof which Moses was to give to the elders of Israel consisted in demonstrating that there is a Being of absolute existence, that has never been and never will be without existence.”<br>Now according to these Sages,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">226</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Namely, Rabbi Yitzchak, Rav Saadia Gaon, and Rambam in his Moreh Nebuchim, all mentioned above.</i> it is necessary to explain that the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses that he should tell them this Name and teach them its import. That is to say, Moses was to inform them of this Name and show the rational proofs by which His eternal being or existence would be firmly established among their wise men. The mere mention of the Divine Name — be it whatever it may —is no proof in itself to eradicate the doctrine of the eternity [of matter] from among them, or the calculated heresy of denying the existence [of the Supreme Being] altogether. But this is not the sense of the verse! Rather, [it clearly implies] that the very mention of the Name to them will be the proof, sign and token on the matter they will have asked of Moses.<br>In my opinion, the elders of Israel never doubted the existence of the Creator, as the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] said — Heaven forbid! But this Name does contain the answer to [Moses’ question of G-d], as we have explained it to you.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">227</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Namely, that Moses asked by what Divine attribute is his mission to them, whether with the attribute of <i>E-il Sha-dai</i> which stood by the patriarchs, or with the high attribute of mercy with which signs and wonders, new phenomena in creation, will be done to speed their redemption — all as explained above.</i> He informed Moses that he is being sent to them with the attribute of justice, which is within the attribute of mercy, [suggesting that the miracles which will be done on behalf of their deliverance from the bondage will at the same time be acts of judgment against the Egyptians. This is the sense of <i>Eh’yeh Asher Eh’yeh:</i> “<i>I will be</i> in judgment <i>that which I will be</i> in mercy].” And then G-d said to Moses, <i>Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel: ‘Eh’yeh’ sent me unto you</i>, thus teaching the unity [of the two attributes, which explains why the Divine Name is not mentioned here twice]. It is for this reason that G-d commanded Moses yet further, <i>Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel: The Eternal… hath sent me unto you</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">228</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 15. The Divine Name mentioned here is the Tetragrammaton.</i> for this Name, [i.e., the Tetragrammaton], indicates the attribute of mercy, and thus they will know <i>that He hath caused His glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">229</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 63:12.</i> and He will make new signs and wonders in the world. Thus G-d explained to Moses that the Name <i>Eh’yeh</i> which He commanded him to tell the children of Israel corresponds to this Great Name [the Tetragrammaton] and that they are alike in language, [as both signify eternal existence], and in letters, for the two final letters of the first Name [<i>Eh’yeh</i>] constitute the first ones in the Tetragrammaton. And may the Holy One, blessed be He, show us wonders in His Torah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">230</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See a similar ending in Vol. I, p. 553.

However, from the concluding language of this Midrash quoted here further — <i>kol had’varim</i> (‘all’ the words) — it is clear that the sense here is also “words,” and reference is to the wording of the message of redemption: <i>pakod pakad’ti</i>.</i> They would have said that his father handed him over these words, as Joseph had handed them over to Levi, and Levi to Kohath, and Kohath to Amram.

[The expressions], ‘yesterday,’ ‘recently,’ and ‘since Thou hast spoken,’ imply three days, and the three-fold word <i>gam</i> — [here translated ‘neither’ or ‘nor,’ but literally meaning ‘also’] — points to a similar extension of time. Thus you have six days [that have passed], and it was now the seventh day [when Moses still refused to go on his mission].” Thus the language of Rashi.<br>In line with the plain meaning of Scripture, the purport of the verse is as follows: [Moses said,] “For I am slow of speech from heretofore and from time past, for I have been slow of speech from my youth on and all the more now that I am old, <i>and also</i> now <i>since Thou hast spoken unto Thy servant</i>, for Thou hast not removed the defect in my speech when Thou didst command me to go to Pharaoh to speak in Thy name.

Terrified at what had happened, the magicians advised that he be slain. But Jethro, who was one of the counsellors of the king, advised that he be tested as follows: Two dishes were to be placed before him, one containing pieces of gold and the other live coal. If he would stretch out his hand for the gold, it would be known that his taking the crown was done consciously, and therefore he was to be slain. But it he would grasp the live coal, he was innocent. When the test was made, Moses began stretching his hand toward the gold, but the angel Gabriel made him take the live coal. Thereupon Moses put his hand with the coal into his mouth, which burnt part of his tongue. As a result, he became slow of speech and of a slow tongue for all his life.</i><br>The correct interpretation appears to me to be that G-d said to Moses, “<i>Who hath made man’s mouth? or Who maketh a man dumb? … Is it not I the Eternal</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">273</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 11.</i> Who does all this?

Ibn Ezra’s intent is thus to explain this verse as saying: “<i>See</i> that for <i>all the wonders which I have put in thy hand</i> and which you will do <i>before Pharaoh</i>, for all of these he will not let them go until you will tell him that I will slay his son, his firstborn. Then he will let them go.”<br>This explanation is not correct for what sense is there for the expression, <i>when thou goest back into Egypt, see</i>, etc.?

But nothing was mentioned to Moses about what that plague was. Ramban suggests that Verses 22-23 here concerning the final plague were said to Moses now with the understanding that later, before the tenth plague, he was to relay the warning to Pharaoh, but not that he said it to Pharaoh as soon as he came to see him. Hence it was not necessary for Scripture to say in Chapter 11, Verse 1, what that “one plague more” was.</i><br>It is possible to explain [the matter as follows]: “<i>See all</i> these three<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">312</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The staff turning into a serpent, Moses’ hand becoming leprous, and the waters turning into blood (Verses 3-9).</i> <i>wonders which I have put in thy hand</i> to do before the Israelites, <i>do them</i> also <i>before Pharaoh</i> so that Pharaoh should know that the elders of the people who request of him to let them go say so according to the commandment of G-d, and he should not come with a pretext against them.” And so did Moses do [these three wonders<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">312</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The staff turning into a serpent, Moses’ hand becoming leprous, and the waters turning into blood (Verses 3-9).</i> before Pharaoh], even though it is not so written. The verse [further on] which states, <i>When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying: ‘Show a wonder for you,’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">313</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 7:9.</i> [which might indicate that the wonder of the staff turning into a serpent was done by a special command, and not because of the Divine communication here, as explained above], means that Pharaoh will want a sign for himself. G-d thus commanded Moses to throw the rod and it shall become a <i>tanin</i>, not a <i>nachash</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">314</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban thus distinguishes between the <i>nachash</i> mentioned here in Verse 3, and <i>tanin</i> mentioned further in 7:9.

In our texts of Rashi: “Them,” which refers to all three patriarchs, and so it is mentioned further on.</i> but did not fulfill them [during their lifetime].”<br>All these are the words of Rashi. His intent is to explain that the fulfillment of His promise [to the patriarchs] had not taken place. Even though the time for the fulfillment had not arrived [in their lifetime, and consequently the absence of such fulfillment was no indication of a lack of His “keeping faith” since the time had not arrived], yet He was not known to the patriarchs in the fulfillment of His promise.<br>But with all this interpretation, Rashi has not properly explained the language of the text.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew text reads: <i>ush’mi Hashem lo nodati lahem</i> (literally: <i>and My Name the Eternal I was not made known to them</i>). Ramban’s point is that according to Rashi’s interpretation, the verse should have read either (a) <i>lo hodati</i> (I did not make known), or (b) <i>ush’mi Hashem lo noda lahem</i> (and My Name the Eternal was not known to them).</i> [According to his interpretation], it should be said, <i>lo hodati</i> [“and My Name, the Eternal, ‘I did not make known’ to them,” instead of <i>lo nodati</i> (<i>I was not made known</i>), as the text reads]. Or it should have said, “and My Name, the Eternal, <i>lo noda</i> (was not known) to them.” Perhaps according to Rashi’s opinion, the sense of the verse is: “and My Name is the Eternal, <i>v’lo</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban adds here the letter <i>vav</i> to the word <i>lo — v’lo</i> — thus making it independent of the expression <i>ush’mi Hashem</i>. Accordingly, there are two separate thoughts expressed: “and My Name is the Eternal,” which denotes that “I am certain to substantiate My promise,” and “I was not made known to them by that Name since I made promises to them but did not fulfill them.”</i> <i>nodati lahem</i>,” meaning that “I was not made known to them by that Name.”<br>And the learned Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra explained that the letter <i>beth</i> of the words <i>b’E-il Sha-dai</i> (by the Name G-d Almighty) connected [with the ensuing words <i>ush’mi Hashem</i>, making it <i>ubish’mi Hashem</i>], which has the following meaning: “And I appeared unto Abraham, etc., by the Name <i>E-il Sha-dai</i> (G-d Almighty), but <i>by</i> My Name the Eternal I was not made known unto them.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus according to Ibn Ezra, the sense of the verse is as if it were written: “And I appeared into Abraham…<i>b’E-il Sha-dai ubish’mi</i> — [instead of <i>ush’mi</i>] — <i>Hashem lo nodati lahem</i> (and by My Name the Eternal I was not made known to them).”</i><br>The purport of the verse is that He appeared to the patriarchs by this Name [<i>E-il Sha-dai</i>], which indicates that He is the victor [and prevailer]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Vol. I, pp. 215-6 and 556-7, for further discussion of this theme.

If man were left to his nature or his fortune, his deeds would neither add to him nor diminish from him. Rather, reward and punishment in this world, as mentioned in the entire scope of the Torah, are all miracles, but they are hidden. They appear to the onlooker as being part of the natural order of things, but in truth they come upon man as punishment and reward [for his deeds]. It is for this reason that the Torah speaks at great length of the assurances concerning this world, and does not explain the assurances of the soul in “the World of Souls.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the world to which the soul goes following the death of the body. At the resurrection, body and soul will be reunited. That world, according to Ramban, is <i>Olam Haba</i> (the Coming World).

The <i>Olam Han’shamoth</i> is concomitant with this world, and <i>Olam Haba</i> is the world of the future.</i> These [assurances mentioned in the Torah as recompense for the observance or transgression of the Divine Commandments] are wonders which go contrary to nature,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“For it is not by nature that the heavens become as iron because we have sowed our fields in the Sabbatical year, etc.” (Ramban, Vol. I, p. 557.)</i> while the existence of the soul [after the death of the body] and its cleaving unto G-d are the proper way inherent in its nature that she <i>returneth unto G-d Who gave it</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ecclesiastes 12:7.</i> I will yet explain it further<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 26:11.</i> if G-d accomplishes it for me.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Psalms 57:3.</i><br>Thus G-d said to Moses: “I have appeared to the patriarchs with the might of My arm with which I prevail over the constellations and help those whom I have chosen, but with My Name <i>Yod Hei</i> with which all existence came into being I was not made known to them, that is, to create new things for them by the open change of nature.

Ramban uses the expression here to intimate that Ibn Ezra did indeed allude to the correct interpretation of the verse, namely, that the letter <i>beth</i> in <i>b’E-il Sha-dai</i> is connected also to <i>ush’mi Hashem</i>, making it <i>ubish’mi Hashem</i>, as explained above (see Note 8). But, suggests Ramban, there is still a question to be raised on Ibn Ezra’s explanation, as explained further in the text.</i> Even according to his interpretation, the verse should have said, “And I made Myself <i>known</i> to Abraham, etc., by the name of <i>E-il Sha-dai</i>, but by My Name <i>Hashem</i>, [which describes My true essence], I did not make Myself known to them,” or it should have said, “but by the Name <i>Hashem</i> I did not <i>appear</i> to them.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, why does the Torah use two separate terms: <i>va’eira</i> (<i>and I appeared</i>) and <i>nodati</i> (<i>made Me known</i>)? One term — “appear” or “made Me known” — should have sufficed in both cases.</i> However, Ibn Ezra can answer this by saying that because the prophecy of the patriarchs came to them <i>in the visions of the night</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 46:2. See also Ramban, <i>ibid.</i>, 15:1 (Vol. I, p. 193).</i> He said here, <i>Va’eira</i> (<i>And I appeared</i>) to them, and because that of Moses was <i>face to face</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 34:10.</i> He said here, “<i>I made Me not known to them</i> [the patriarchs] as I made Myself known to you [Moses].”",
                    "By way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], the verse can be explained in consonance with its plain meaning and intent.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban is suggesting that whereas in other places the mystic teachings of the Cabala do not reflect the plain meaning of Scripture, here “the way of the Truth” is in harmony with the plain meaning and import of the text.</i> He is saying: “I the Eternal appeared to the patriarchs through the speculum of <i>E-il Sha-dai</i>,” just as is the sense of the verse, <i>In a vision do I make Myself known to him</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 12:6.</i> “But Myself, I the Eternal did not make Myself known to them, as they did not contemplate [Me] through a lucid speculum so that they should know me,” just as is the sense of the verse, <i>And there hath not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Eternal knew face to face</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 34:10.</i> The patriarchs did know the Proper Name of the Eternal, but it was not known to them through prophecy.

But with Moses, His conduct and His recognition to him were by the attribute of mercy, which is indicated by His Great Name, [i.e., the Tetragrammaton — the Eternal], just as is denoted in the verse, <i>He caused His glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 63:12.</i> and it is written, <i>So didst Thou lead Thy people, to make Thyself a glorious name</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 14.</i> Therefore Moses does not henceforth mention the name <i>E-il Sha-dai</i>, for the Torah was given with His great Name, as it is said, <i>I am the Eternal thy G-d</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 20:2.</i> This is the sense of the verse, <i>Our of heaven He made thee to hear His voice, that He might instruct thee; and upon earth He made thee to see His great fire</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 4:36.</i> I have already alluded to the explanation of the word <i>hashamayim</i> (the heaven).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Genesis 1:8 (Vol. I, p. 37).</i> May the Holy One, blessed be He, open our eyes and show us wonders in His Torah."

The verse, <i>And the Eternal spoke unto Moses, saying</i>, means really explicitly, free from doubt or uncertainty.

                    "AND THE MAGICIANS SAID UNTO PHARAOH: THIS IS THE FINGER OF G-D. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented that because the magicians had done as Aaron did with the serpent and also with the plagues of blood and the frogs and now they could not do so, they therefore said to Pharaoh: “This plague of gnats has not come through Aaron for the sake of Israel. Rather it is a plague of G-d due to the particular [evil] stars under which the land of Egypt found itself at the time.” Pharaoh did not deny the existence of the Creator<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">142</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ramban above in <i>Seder Shemoth</i> 5:3.</i> but only the Divine Name which Moses mentioned to him. This is similar in sense to the verse, <i>It was not His hand that smote us; it was a chance that happened to us</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">143</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 6:9.</i> Therefore Pharaoh’s heart was hardened. And Ibn Ezra brought proof for his explanation from the fact that Scripture does not state that the magicians said, “This is the finger of the Eternal,” which would have been a reference to the G-d of Israel, just as Pharaoh said to Moses and Aaron, <i>Entreat the Eternal</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">144</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 4.</i> Another proof [which Ibn Ezra brought for his explanation] is that in the case of the smiting of the river, Moses had forewarned Pharaoh,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">145</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above 7:17-18. And so also was there a forewarning in the case of the frogs (<i>ibid.</i>, Verses 27-29).</i> but he mentioned nothing to him about the plague of gnats. [Therefore the magicians felt justified in saying that it was not a plague for the sake of Israel but merely due to the evil stars.]<br>Ibn Ezra’s interpretation does not appear to me to be correct. “A chance” is not called “the finger of G-d.” Only a plague which comes directly from Him as a form of punishment is called <i>the hand of the Eternal</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">146</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 5:9.</i> and <i>the finger of G-d</i>, just as it is written in the verse which [Ibn Ezra] mentioned: <i>It was not His hand that smote us</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">143</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 6:9.</i> And it is furthermore written: <i>And Israel saw the great hand;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">147</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 14:31.</i> <i>And the hand of the Eternal shall be against you</i>;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">148</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 12:15 and <i>ibid.</i>, 5:11.</i> <i>the hand of G-d was very heavy there</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">148</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 12:15 and <i>ibid.</i>, 5:11.</i> Moreover, in the next plague of swarms, as well as in the following ones, Pharaoh no longer called upon the magicians to stand before Moses to do the same things, even though there had been a forewarning of their coming!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">149</sup><i class=\"footnote\">How then could Ibn Ezra say that because Moses had not forewarned Pharaoh of the coming of the gnats, the magicians said that the plague came through the evil stars and not from the Eternal? In the following plagues when Pharaoh was forewarned of their coming, why did he not call upon the magicians to do likewise? The answer must be, as Ramban explains, that in the case of the plague of the gnats, the magicians already admitted that it was from the Eternal and therefore they could not do likewise. There was thus no need for Pharaoh to call upon them in the following plagues of which he was forewarned, since those were surely from the Eternal, the G-d of Israel, before Whom the magicians were helpless.</i><br>But the subject, in accordance with the simple explanation of Scripture, is as follows: When the magicians saw that they could not bring forth the gnats, they admitted Aaron’s deed to be through an act of G-d, and this is why Pharaoh no longer called upon them from that time on. They [the magicians] said, <i>This is ‘the finger’ of G-d</i>, and not “the hand” of G-d [as is the customary way of the Scriptures to refer to plagues, as e.g., <i>It was not His ‘hand’ that smote us</i>]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">143</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 6:9.</i> in order to minimize the plague, that is to say, it is but a small plague from Him [which we can easily endure].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">150</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his Discourse “The Law of the Eternal is Perfect,” Ramban adds: “Nevertheless the magicians [thereby] admitted [that it was an act of G-d], and thus they became apprised of the fact that Moses’ deed was effectuated by the Lord of the universe.”</i> They did not, however, say to Pharaoh, “This is the finger of ‘the Eternal,’” [but instead they said, <i>“This is the finger of ‘G-d’”</i>]. Pharaoh and his servants would not mention the Proper Divine Name except when speaking to Moses because he mentioned that Name to them. [In addressing Pharaoh, however, the magicians would not use that Name since that would be an open recognition on their part of His existence and power. Therefore they said to Pharaoh, <i>“ This is the finger of ' G-d, ’”</i> although their intent was to say, “This is the finger of ‘the Eternal.’ “] That the magicians could not bring forth the gnats was [not because they really could not do it, but it] was by reason of the fact that G-d so caused it to happen to them. He confounded their counsel in accordance with His Will, for everything is His and it is within His power to do all.<br>It appears to me further that in the first two plagues — in the one of blood, where the water naturally<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">151</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since water and blood are both liquids, the change of the one into the other may be spoken of as in “the nature” of things inasmuch as both are classified under the element of water. See above, Note 117, on the four elements.</i> changed into blood, and in the one of the frogs, which consisted of bringing them up from the river — since they did not involve the creation of some new phenomenon out of nothing or some act of new formation,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">152</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew text reads: <i>bri’ah o yetzirah</i>. See Vol. I, p. 23, that only the term <i>bara</i> (or <i>bri’ah</i>) signifies “bringing forth something from nothing.”</i> the magicians could do [as Aaron did]. Scripture does not say, “and the frogs came into existence,” but only, <i>and the frogs came up;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">153</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 2.</i> they assembled and came up. In the plague of gnats, however, there was an act of creation, for it is not in the nature of dust to turn into gnats. Therefore He said, <i>that it may become gnats</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">154</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 12. The word “become” suggests a new act of creation.</i> The verse, <i>And the magicians did so with their secret arts to bring forth gnats</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">155</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 14.</i> is similar in intent to: <i>Let the earth bring forth the living creature</i>, etc., <i>and it was so</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">156</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 1:24. In other words, the expression here, “to bring forth the gnats,” means a new act of creation, just as in the Book of Genesis.</i> But only the Creator, praised and magnified be He, can perform such a [new] act of creation. The verse, <i>And the magicians did so…but they could not</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">155</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 14.</i> means they incanted the demons to do their command, but they were powerless.<br>Confirming me in my opinion concerning the frogs, [i.e., that there was no new act of creation there], is the following text [of the Talmud]:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">157</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 67b.</i> ‘Rabbi Akiba said that there was only one frog<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">158</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As Verse 2 has it: <i>‘Vata’al hatz’phardei’a’</i> (<i>and the frog came up</i>), in the singular.</i> which swarmed and filled the whole land of Egypt. Rabbi Eliezer<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">159</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Eliezer.” In our text of the Gemara, “Eleazar,” and so also further in Ramban.</i> ben Azaryah said to him: ‘Akiba, what have you to do with Agadah (homily)? Turn from these matters and go instead to [delve in the difficulties of] Negaim<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">160</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Negaim (Leprosies) is the name of a treatise in the Mishnah dealing with the laws of leprosy. It is considered a very difficult subject.</i> and Oholoth.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">161</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Oholoth (Tents) is one of the most difficult treatises of the Mishnah. It deals with the laws regarding the uncleanness of a corpse as affecting a house and its vessels, as well as human beings.</i> It was only one frog croaking to all other frogs, and so they gathered.’” Rabbi Eleazar ben Azaryah could not accept the opinion [of Rabbi Akiba] that the magicians should have been able to bestow a new nature upon the frog, i.e., that one frog should give birth to so many, which is contrary to its nature, but rather they gathered them in order to bring them up. In the opinion then of Rabbi Akiba, the verse <i>And the river shall swarm with frogs</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">162</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 7:28.</i> means that the river should swarm with them more than its due. But according to Rabbi Eleazar ben Azaryah, the sense of that verse is like, <i>‘shirtzu’ in the earth</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">163</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 9:7. Said to Noah and his sons.</i> which connotes movement, as I have explained in <i>Seder Bereshith</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">164</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 1:20 (Vol. I, pp. 47-48).</i> and here its meaning is that the frogs gather and move about in the river and from there go up upon Egypt.<br>Now with regard to the gnats, our Rabbis have said<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">165</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 67 b, and mentioned by Rashi here in Verse 14.</i> that the demon [through whose power this was to be done by the magicians] is powerless in the case of a creature that is smaller than a lentil.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">166</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Lentil.” In our text of the Gemara, as well as in Rashi here: “a barley-corn.” At any rate, it was completely unnecessary for Scripture to inform us that the magicians could not bring forth gnats, as these are creatures smaller in size than a barley-corn. The expression, <i>but they could not</i>, must hence mean as explained in the text. Such is Ramban’s intent as explained by Rabbeinu Bachya. See my Hebrew commentary, p. 313.</i> The expression, <i>but they could not</i>, must therefore mean that they could not assemble gnats from their [breeding] places and bring them.<br>In Midrash Rabbah, the Rabbis have further said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">167</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shemoth Rabbah 10:7.</i> “Perceiving that they cannot bring forth the gnats, the magicians at once recognized that [Aaron’s deed] was an act of G-d and not an act of the demons. From that moment on, therefore, they were no longer anxious to liken themselves to Moses by bringing forth the plagues.”<br>Now with regard to Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra’s statement that Moses did not inform them of the coming of the plague of gnats, it appears to me that Aaron struck [the dust of the earth] with the rod <i>in the sight of Pharaoh</i>, just as he did in the case of the soot of the furnace.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">168</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 9:8. In other words, just as in the case of boils it is said that it was done in the sight of the king, so also in the case of gnats, where the verse reads, <i>And Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod and smote the dust of the earth</i> (Verse 13), it was done in the sight of the king.</i> However, there was no forewarning here, since the Holy One, blessed be He, warned Pharaoh only of those plagues which entailed the death of people. In the case of the frogs, [there was also death involved], as it is written: <i>And</i> [He sent among them] <i>frogs, which destroyed them</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">169</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 78:45.</i> which is an allusion to death or to the kind of destruction mentioned by our Rabbis,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">170</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shemoth Rabbah 10:4.</i> i.e., that the frogs made them impotent. Similarly, [He warned him of] the locusts, [which destroyed the crops], because it would cause the Egyptians to die of hunger, for they ate up <i>the residue of that which escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">171</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 10:5.</i> All this reflects His mercies towards man, just as it is said, <i>Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it, and he turn not from his way; he shall die in his iniquity, but thou hast delivered thy soul</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">172</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 33:9.</i> Therefore, He did not warn Pharaoh of the plagues of gnats, boils, and darkness, [as these did not entail the loss of human lives]. He warned him<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">173</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 9:3-4.</i> only of the pestilence of cattle because it involved death which should have taken effect also on man, as He told him afterward, <i>For now I might have stretched out My hand and I might have smitten thee and thy people with pestilence. But in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up</i>, etc.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">174</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 15-16.</i> Therefore He informed him of what was to happen.<br>In the case of certain plagues, [i.e., blood, swarms, and hail], G-d said to Moses, <i>Rise up early in the morning … lo he cometh forth to the water</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">175</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The three verses are mentioned by Ramban more fully later in the text. Here he mentions the text in a general way although it is based on Verse 16 here.</i> In line with the plain meaning of Scripture,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">176</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi commented (above, 7:15): “<i>Lo, he goeth forth unto the water</i> to ease himself. Pharaoh claimed to be a god and asserted that [because of his divine powers], he did not need to ease himself. Therefore he would rise early and go forth to the Nile to ease himself in secret.” This interpretation of Rashi which is based upon a Midrash (Tanchuma Va’eira, 14) is alluded to by Ramban’s words that his own explanation is “in line with the plain meaning of Scripture,” thus implying that there is a Midrashic or homiletic interpretation of the verse, namely, that of Rashi mentioned above.</i> this was the time when the kings were wont to go forth in the morning to enjoy themselves in the waters, and the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded Moses to go there. The reason for it is that since the plague of blood was the first one [of the plagues], He wanted Moses to do it in the sight of the king and without fear of him. This is the sense of the expression, <i>and thou shalt place thyself towards him</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">177</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 7:15, in the case of the first plague.</i> Similarly, in the plague of swarms it is said, <i>Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">178</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here in Verse 16.</i> and also in the case of hail it is said, <i>Rise up early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">179</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 9:13.</i> which likewise took place when the king went forth to the water. He wanted these two plagues to be wrought [at that particular time] because since swarms and hail brought death and punishment upon the people, the Holy One, blessed be He, wanted the warning to be given in the sight of all people. When the king went forth to the water, a multitude of people followed him, and when Moses will then forewarn him in their sight, perhaps they might plead with their master to return from his evil way. In case they do not do so, they will deserve punishment. But in the case of the other plagues, the warning given to the king alone was sufficient, and therefore in connection with them it is said, <i>Go in unto Pharaoh</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">180</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 7:26 (in the plague of frogs); further, 9:1 (pestilence), and 10:1 (locusts).</i> meaning that Moses was to go into the palace. In the case of gnats and boils, it does not say [that Moses was to go into the palace] because Aaron had to strike the dust of the earth [to bring on the plague of the gnats], and in the king’s palace there is no dust, as it has <i>a pavement of green and white marble</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">181</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Esther 1:6.</i> In the case of boils, Moses had to throw the soot of the furnace heavenward.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">182</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 9:10.</i> Thus [we must say that] these two plagues, [i.e., gnats and boils], were done in the sight of Pharaoh when he was <i>in the court of the garden of the king’s palace</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">183</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Esther 1:5.</i> or some similar place."

In the name of Rav Saadia Gaon,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">230</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mentioned by Ibn Ezra here. One of the greatest Jewish personalities of all times, Rav Saadia (892 or 882-942) was Gaon of the Academy of Sura. He wrote extensively on every aspect of Jewish learning: Bible, Talmud, grammar, philology, philosophy, polemics against the Karaites, etc. His work, Ha’emunoth Vehadei’oth, the first of its kind in the field of Jewish religious philosophy, exercised a great influence on Jewish thought. He translated the Scriptures into Arabic and wrote extensive commentaries in Arabic on the books of the Bible, which influenced the later commentators. Ramban’s knowledge of his commentaries, as indicated here, seems to have been mainly through a secondary source. See, however, Note 224 in <i>Seder Shemoth</i> that there is some proof indicating that Ramban may have seen the Gaon’s commentary in the original Arabic.</i> the commentators have said that these [two verses are also part of] Moses’ words to Pharaoh. He said to him: “Before you had feared G-d and said, <i>The Eternal is the righteous One</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">231</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 27.</i> the flax and the barley were already smitten and these can no longer be saved. <i>But the wheat and the spelt were not smitten</i> yet, and henceforth you will no longer suffer damage.”<br>I find no sense in this explanation. <i>The hail smote every herb of the field</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">232</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 25.</i> and broke every tree,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">232</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 25.</i> and the wheat and the spelt were saved only because they had not sprouted at all or because they were so tender that they were not destroyed completely by the hail since they could sprout again. That being the case, even if the hail had continued for days more to come down upon them, there would not be a loss. There was thus no need for Moses to inform Pharaoh of what he lost and what he did not lose, for when the hail will be removed, he will himself see!<br>In my opinion, these are Moses’ words to Pharaoh. Moses said to him: “I know that before the plagues are removed, you fear G-d, and afterward you repeat your folly.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">233</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Proverbs 26:11.</i> Now the flax and the barley were smitten while the wheat and the spelt which are your livelihood were not smitten in this plague, but it is within G-d’s power to destroy them if you return and sin again before Him.” Thus Moses alluded to them that which G-d said later [of the locust], <i>And they shall eat the residue of that which escaped</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">234</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 10:5.</i><br>Bo"

This is a clear indication that the servants too had joined the king in admitting their guilt.

(Mizrachi in explanation of Ramban’s intent.)</i> Instead, [we must say that the expression], <i>in all the borders of Egypt</i>, is connected with the end of the verse: <i>before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such</i> there [in Egypt, but in other places there may be].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is thus no contradiction to the prophet Joel’s words. That plague of locusts did not occur in the land of Egypt.</i> It is possible that because the land of Egypt is exceedingly moistened by the river, locusts are not abundant there, for these naturally come in years of drought, as is mentioned by the prophet Joel.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>For the water brooks are dried up</i> (Joel 1:20).</i><br>Now Rabbeinu Chananel<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A Rabbi of Kairwan, North Africa, who flourished in the first half of the eleventh century, just when the Gaonic period in Babylon was about to come to a close. Rabbeinu Chananel’s commentaries on the Talmud are among the most important works in Rabbinic literature. He also wrote a commentary on the Torah, which has been lost in the course of time, except for important extracts from it which are found mostly in the commentary of Bachya ben Asher. Some extracts are found in the works of Ramban and in the Sermons of Yehoshua ibn Shuib, a pupil of Rashba. An edition of mine of these collected explanations of Rabbeinu Chananel has recently appeared through the Mosad Harav Kook, Jerusalem, and they indicate a wide spectrum of interests on the part of the author in Biblical themes.</i> has written in his commentary on the Torah: “From the time that Moses our teacher prayed [for the removal of the locusts] till now, the locusts have not caused damage to the entire land of Egypt, and if an attack of them does occur in the Land of Israel and they proceed to enter within the border of Egypt, they do not devour the produce of the land. People say that this is known by all. Come and see! In the case of frogs, Moses said, <i>Only in the river they will remain</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 8:5.</i> and therefore the <i>altamtzach</i> — [the Arabic word for frogs] — have remained in the river till now.

Through the magnitude of the plague, the Egyptians thus knew that it was a special act of G-d, since the like never happened before.

And this is the reason it does not say at the beginning [of Verse 2], <i>Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel</i>, since “the Sanctification of the New Moon” can be performed only by Moses and Aaron and their like.<br>Now the purport of the expression, <i>This month shall be unto you the beginning of months</i>, is that Israel is to count this as the first of the months, and from it they are to count all months — second, third, etc., until a year of twelve months is completed — in order that there be through this enumeration a remembrance of the great miracle, [i.e., the exodus from Egypt, which occurred in the first month]. Whenever we will mention the months, the miracle will be remembered.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">102</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus everytime a person says, for example, “the third month,” he implies that it is the third in the order of the months which begins with Nisan, when the exodus occurred.</i> It is for this reason that the months have no individual names in the Torah. Instead, Scripture says: <i>In the third month;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">103</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 19:1.</i> <i>And it came to pass in the second year, in the second month … that the cloud was taken up from over the Tabernacle of the Testimony;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">104</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 10:11.</i> <i>And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month</i>, etc.,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">105</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 29:1.</i> and so in all cases. Just as in counting the weekdays we always remember the Sabbath-day since the weekdays have no specific name of their own, but instead are called “one day in the Sabbath,” “the second day in the Sabbath,” as I will explain,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">106</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 20:8.</i> so we remember the exodus from Egypt in our counting “the first month,” “the second month,” “the third month,” etc., to our redemption.<br>This order of the counting of the months is not in regard to the years, for the beginning of our years is from Tishri, [the seventh month], as it is written, <i>And the feast of ingathering at the turn of the year</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">107</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 34:22. Now the feast of ingathering is in the seventh month (Leviticus 23:39) and yet Scripture calls it here <i>at the turn of the year</i>, which means the beginning of the new year. Thus we learn that Tishri is the beginning of the year, although in the order of the counting of the months it is the seventh month.</i> and it is further written, <i>And the feast of ingathering, at the end of the year</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">108</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 23:16.</i> If so, when we call the month of Nisan the first of the months and Tishri the seventh, the meaning thereof is “the first [month] to the redemption” and “the seventh month” thereto. This then is the intent of the expression, <i>it shall be the first month to you</i>, meaning that it is not the first in regard to the year but it is the first “to you,” i.e., that it be called “the first” for the purpose of remembering our redemption.<br>Our Rabbis have already mentioned this matter when saying,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">109</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yerushalmi Rosh Hashanah I, 2.</i> “The names of the months came up with us from Babylon,” since at first we had no names for the months. The reason for this [adoption of the names of the months when our ancestors returned from Babylon to build the Second Temple], was that at first their reckoning was a memorial to the exodus from Egypt, but when we came up from Babylon, and the words of Scripture were fulfilled — <i>And it shall no more be said: As the Eternal liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, but: As the Eternal liveth that brought up and that led the children of Israel from the land of the north</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">110</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 16:14-15. The expression <i>and that led</i> is found <i>ibid.</i>, 23:8.</i> — from then on we began to call the months by the names they were called in the land of Babylon. We are thus reminded that there we stayed [during our exile] and from there, blessed G-d brought us up [to our Land].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">111</sup><i class=\"footnote\">From Ramban’s “Sermon on Rosh Hashanah,” where he discussed the same topic (Kithvei Haramban, Vol. I, p. 215), it is crystal clear that the author’s intent here was not that the memorial of the redemption from Babylon will thrust aside the memorial of the redemption from Egypt. Rather, the one of Babylon will be added to that of Egypt, so that the names of the months will be reminiscent of the two redemptions together. See Note 114 further, for example. Joseph Albo’s position in his book Ikkarim (Roots), III, 16, that Ramban’s intent here was that after the return from the Babylonian exile, the first memorial was to give way altogether to the second, is thus not correct. For further discussion of this problem see the note in my Hebrew commentary Vol. II, p. 520.</i> These names — Nisan, Iyar, and the others — are Persian names and are to be found only in the books of the prophets of the Babylonian era<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">112</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Zechariah 1:7, etc.; Ezra 6:15; Nehemiah 1:1.</i> and in the Scroll of Esther.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">113</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Esther 3:7, etc.</i> It is for this reason that Scripture says, <i>In the first month, which is the month of Nisan</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">114</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i> Thus both memorials are mentioned simultaneously: <i>the first month</i> to our redemption from Egypt, <i>which is the month of Nisan</i>, a name which is reminiscent of our Babylonian exile from which we have also been redeemed.</i> just as it says, <i>they cast ‘pur,’ that is, the lot</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">115</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i> In this case too Scripture explains the Persian word <i>pur</i> as meaning lot, just as it explained the name Nisan as being “the first month.”</i> To this day, people of Persia and Media use these names of the months — Nisan, Tishri, and the others — as we do. Thus through the names of the months we remember our second redemption even as we had done until then with regard to the first one."

It appears to me that the expression <i>bein ha’arbayim</i> denotes those hours which are between the beginning of the darkening of the day and the final darkening at night. The darkening of the day is at the beginning of the seventh hour of the day, from the time <i>the shadows of the evening are stretched out</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">120</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 6:4.</i> and the darkening of the night is at the beginning of the night. The word <i>erev</i> (night) is an expression of gloom and darkness, just as in the verse, <i>All joy is ‘arbah’</i> (<i>darkened</i>).”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">121</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 24:11.</i> Thus the language of Rashi.<br>Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra refuted [this explanation of Rashi] by pointing to the verse which says, <i>And when Aaron lighteth the lamps ‘bein ha’arbayim’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">122</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 30:8.</i> [‘There is no doubt that he lights the lamps at sundown”], as it is written there, <i>Aaron and his sons shall set it in order from evening to morning</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">123</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 27:21.</i> [Thus it proves that <i>bein ha’arbayim</i> does not begin with the seventh hour of the day as Rashi would have it, but at sundown near night.] Besides, the verse regarding the paschal offering itself states: <i>There thou shalt sacrifice the Passover-offering at even, at the going down of the sun, at the time thou camest forth out of Egypt</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">124</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 16:6.</i> and “the going down of the sun” occurs at sunset. [How then could Rashi explain <i>bein ha’arbayim</i> mentioned here as commencing at the seventh hour of the day?]<br>But this is no refutation of the Rabbi’s [Rashi’s] explanation. Our Rabbis have already said<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">125</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Berachoth 9a.</i> that the meaning of the verse is as follows: “<i>At even</i>, you slaughter [the Passover-offering]; <i>at the going down of the sun</i>, you eat it; <i>at the time thou camest forth out of Egypt</i>, [i.e., in the morning of the fifteenth day of Nisan, it becomes <i>nothar</i>]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">126</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, “left over.” Portions of sacrifices left over after the prescribed time within which they are to be eaten must be burnt. See “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 103-4. Now since the Passover-offering is to be eaten only on the night of the fifteenth day, whatever is left by the morning of that day is to be burnt. The actual burning, however, takes place on the morning of the sixteenth day, since it is not permissible to burn <i>nothar</i> on a Festival day.</i> and you burn it.” The Rabbi [Rashi] has already so commented [in his commentary to Deuteronomy 16:6].<br>The correct interpretation on this matter appears to me to be that the night is called <i>erev</i>, as it is said, <i>‘ba’erev’ ye shall eat unleavened bread</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">127</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 18.</i> and this is at night, as it clearly states, <i>And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">128</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 8.</i> Similarly, <i>And there was ‘erev’ and there was morning</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">129</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 1:5.</i> means the beginning of night when the stars do come forth. The same applies to the verse, <i>In the twilight, ‘ba’erev’ of the day, in the blackness of night and the darkness</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">130</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 7:9.</i> [where the word <i>ba’erev</i>, coming after “the twilight,” must signify the night]. Now the end of the day is also called <i>erev</i>, as the verses indicate: <i>And the two angels came to Sodom ‘ba’erev,’ and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">131</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 19:1. In view of the fact that Lot surely did not sit in the gate at night, <i>ba’erev</i> must mean at the end of the day.</i> <i>And it came to pass ‘ba’erev’ that the quails came up</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">132</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 16:13.</i> and the quails did not come at night.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">133</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 12: <i>At eventide ye shall eat flesh</i>. This clearly indicates that the quails came before the night. The word <i>ba’erev</i> in the verse, <i>And it came to pass ‘ba’erev’ that the quails came up</i>, must therefore mean at the end of the day.</i> There are many other such cases.<br>It is further written: <i>‘Erev,’ and morning, and at noonday, I will sigh and moan</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">134</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 55:18.</i> Now these three periods include the whole day [of twenty-four hours. Therefore, if we interpret <i>erev</i> as meaning actual night, the hours from noonday to night will be missing here. We must] thus conclude that [the period] immediately after noonday is called <i>erev</i>, [which lasts from the latter part of the day till morning. Thus the verse encompasses the whole day of twenty-four hours].<br>Morning is so called from sunrise and thence onward as long as the sun remains in the east. This period lasts four hours, just as the Rabbis testified<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">135</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Tractate Eduyoth 6:1. This testimony is attributed to Rabbi Yehudah ben Baba.</i> that the morning Daily Whole-offering [for the entire congregation of Israel] may be offered in the [first] four hours of the day [but not later].<br>After morning, the time is called <i>tzohorayim</i> (noonday), just as it is said, <i>from morning until ‘tzohorayim’</i> (<i>noon</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">136</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Kings 18:26.</i> It consists of two hours: the fifth and the sixth hours of the day. The word <i>tzohorayim</i> is of the root ‘<i>tzohar</i>’ (<i>A light</i>) <i>shalt thou make to the ark</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">137</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 6:16.</i> and implies brightness. It is written in the plural [<i>tzohorayim</i>] because it is the two [brightest parts of the day] which, so to speak, make two <i>tzohorayim</i>. It may be that it is written in the plural because light is then disseminated on all sides. In the morning the light is centered in the east, and towards evening it is in the west, but in the middle of the day when it is high in the sky, it gives light on all sides.<br>When <i>tzohorayim</i> (noonday) passes and the sun departs from shining upon two sides, the time of the day is called <i>arbayim</i> — [from the root <i>erev</i> (darkness)] - because the sun has darkened from [its state of shining on] those two sides. This period [of <i>arbayim</i>] lasts as long as the sun shines in the sky [and is permissible for the slaughtering of the Passover-offering]. But beginning with sundown, which is about an hour and a quarter [before the day terminates with the coming out of the stars], it is no longer the time for the slaughtering thereof according to the opinion of our Rabbis,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">138</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mechilta Pischa, 5: “<i>At eventide</i>. I might understand this to mean at the evening twilight. Scripture therefore says, etc.”</i> for that period of time is no longer <i>arbayim</i> but rather <i>erev yom</i> (the evening of the day).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">139</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>In the twilight, ‘b’erev yom’</i> (<i>in the evening of the day</i>) (Proverbs 7:9).</i><br>The reason it is called <i>bein ha’arbayim</i> [in the Torah, and not just <i>arbayim</i>], is not that the word <i>bein</i> signifies here “between,” [as Rashi above explained that the expression <i>bein ha’arbayim</i> denotes that time-period which is “between” the beginning of those hours, etc.], but it is something like “in their midst,” similar to these verses: <i>Let there now be an oath ‘beinotheinu beineinu ubeinecha';</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">140</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 26:28. It is generally translated: <i>between us, even between us and thee</i>. But according to Ramban, the meaning thereof would be: “let there be an oath in our midst, even in us and in thee.”</i> <i>A piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that ‘beini ubeincha’?;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">141</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 23:15. It is generally translated: <i>between me and thee</i>. Ramban understands it: “in the midst of me and you, the value of the land is not worth discussing.”</i> <i>And her stature was exalted ‘al bein’</i> (<i>among</i>) <i>the thick branches;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">142</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 19:11. Ramban would explain it: “her stature was exalted in the midst of the thick foliage.”</i> <i>Take fire ‘mibeinoth’ the wheelwork</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">143</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 10:6. It is generally translated: “from ‘between’ the wheelwork.”</i> which means from “within their midst”; <i>Take up their fire-pans ‘mibein’ the burning</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">144</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 17:2.</i> which means “from the midst thereof,” similar to the expression, <i>She rises also ‘be’od’ night</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">145</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 31:15. It is generally translated: “she rises also ‘while it is yet’ night.”</i> which means in the midst of the night. And so is the expression <i>bein ha’arbayim</i>, [which signifies “in the midst of that part of the day called <i>arbayim</i>,” as explained above]. It does not state <i>ba’arbayim</i>, for that might have indicated the <i>erev</i> of many days. Thus Scripture is saying that we should slaughter the Passover-offering in the midst of the <i>arbayim</i>, since the time prescribed by the Torah for the slaughtering of the Passover-offering is from after the sixth hour of the day till the commencement of sunset. And Scripture also says, <i>In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month ‘bein ha’arbayim’</i> (<i>at eventide</i>) <i>is the Passover of the Eternal</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">146</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 23:5.</i> which refers to the time of the slaughtering [of the Passover-offering]. Similarly, the verse, <i>In the fourteenth day of this month ‘bein ha’arbayim’ ye shall observe it</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">147</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 9:3.</i> refers to the beginning of the observance, which is the slaughtering, [while the eating of the Passover-offering takes place on the following night]. The verse stating [in connection with the quails], <i>‘bein ha’arbayim’ ye shall eat flesh</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">148</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 16:12.</i> also refers to the hours mentioned, [i.e., from after the sixth hour of the day till the start of sunset], since they had extensive time for the eating of meat. The following verse there which states, <i>And it came to pass ‘ba’erev’</i> (<i>at even</i>), <i>that the quails came up</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">149</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 13.</i> is [so stated] because on the first day, the quails came up for one hour within that period called <i>erev</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">150</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, Scripture is stating that during the part of the day called <i>erev</i> which, as explained above, extends from immediately after <i>tzohorayim</i> until the end of the day — making a period of six hours — the quails came up for a time. See my Hebrew commentary, p. 327, for further discussion of this text.</i> [Therefore it does not say, “and it came to pass <i>bein ha’arbayim</i> that the quails came up,” for that would have signified that the quails came up during the whole stretch of time from after the sixth hour of the day till sundown.]<br>It is possible to explain the expression <i>bein ha’arbayim</i> in accordance with the explanation of Rashi,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">151</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The plural form of <i>arbayim</i> suggests two kinds of <i>erev</i>, and the word <i>bein</i> signifies “between.” Thus <i>bein ha’arbayim</i> denotes those hours which are between the darkening of the day and the darkening of the night. Thus is the explanation of Rashi. Ramban proceeds to confirm Rashi’s explanation that the word <i>bein</i> means “between,” but adds that the plural form of <i>arbayim</i> denotes two different periods of the day, unlike Rashi who wrote that it is between the darkening of the day and the darkening of the night, as will be explained.</i> i.e., that there are two kinds of <i>erev</i>, an <i>erev</i> of the morning and an <i>erev</i> of the day, for Scripture so calls them: <i>the ‘minchah’ of the morning</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">152</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 29:41. Ramban will explain the word <i>minchah</i>.</i> and <i>the ‘minchah’ of the evening</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">153</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Kings 16:15.</i> as it is said, <i>And it came to pass in the morning, about the time of making the ‘minchah’</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">154</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 3:20.</i> and it further says, <i>And I sat appalled until the ‘minchah’ of the evening. And at the evening ‘minchah’ I arose up from my fasting</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">155</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezra 9:4-5.</i> Now the word <i>minchah</i> is an expression denoting the resting of the sun and the diminution of its great light, just as the Targum rendered [<i>l’ruach hayom</i>] <i>l’manach yoma</i> (where the day comes to rest).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">156</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Genesis 3:8, we read: <i>And they</i> [Adam and Eve] <i>heard the voice of the Eternal G-d walking in the garden of Eden ‘l’ruach hayom,’</i> which Rashi interpreted: “in that direction towards which the sun travels, which is the west.” Onkelos rendered it: <i>l’manach yoma</i>, “in the afternoon,” or literally, “when the day comes to rest.” Thus it is seen that the word <i>minchah</i> denotes rest.</i> And the plural form of <i>arbayim</i> connotes the two afternoons: “the greater afternoon,” [i.e., the time from six and a half hours after the beginning of the day], and “the smaller afternoon,” [i.e., from nine and a half hours after the start of the day until sunset], which the Sages have mentioned.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">157</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Berachoth 26b.</i> Now during this entire period [of <i>bein ha’arbayim</i>], it is permissible to kindle the lamps of the candelabrum [in the Sanctuary]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">158</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Unlike the opinion of Ibn Ezra mentioned above, i.e., that the kindling of the lamps of the candelabrum in the Sanctuary was done at sundown.</i> and to burn the incense, both of which are not permissible to be done at night but only at the time of the Daily Whole-offering of the eventide, and in fact their performance precedes the actual offering of the sacrifice upon the altar.<br>Onkelos’ opinion seems to incline towards this explanation [that the plural form of <i>arbayim</i> denotes two different parts of the day], for he translated <i>bein ha’arbayim</i> as <i>bein shimshaya</i> (between the suns), meaning the times when the sun is in the east and the sun is in the west. The verse stating, <i>Aaron and his sons shall set it in order from evening to morning</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">159</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 27:21. From this verse, Ibn Ezra had proven at the beginning of this discussion — see at Note 123 — that the lamps of the candelabrum are kindled at sundown. Ramban proceeds to explain that the purport of the verse is that the priests are to put into the lamps their due measure of oil so that they will burn from evening to morning, but not that it mattered that they were kindled only at sundown. As explained above, that could be done anytime during “the greater afternoon” and “the smaller afternoon.” Thus Ibn Ezra’s strictures on Rashi are removed.</i> means [that it be given its due measure of oil] so that it may burn a whole night [although the actual kindling thereof could be done anytime in the <i>bein ha’arbayim</i>. It does not mean, as Ibn Ezra explained, that this verse teaches that the kindling of the candelabrum took place at sundown].<br>Thus we can explain the verse, <i>There thou shalt sacrifice the Passover-offering ‘ba’erev’</i> (<i>at even</i>),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">160</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 16:6. See above at Note 124 how Ibn Ezra brought this verse in proof against Rashi’s explanation. Ramban already refuted it above on the basis of the teaching of the Rabbis. Here he refutes Ibn Ezra on the basis of the plain meaning of what he has shown, i.e., that <i>erev</i> also means the afternoon, etc. Ramban’s own explanation of this verse is yet to follow.</i> to mean at the above-mentioned time, [i.e., the afternoon], for that is called <i>erev</i> [as explained]. The following expression there, <i>at the going down of the sun</i>, is connected with the following verse, <i>And thou shalt roast and eat it</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">161</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 7.</i> There are many such cases in Scripture [where an expression in one verse is connected with the following verse].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">162</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Vol. I, pp. 437-8.</i><br>In my opinion however, the verse, <i>There thou shalt sacrifice the Passover-offering</i>, does not at all refer to the time of the slaughtering thereof, [which took place on the afternoon of the fourteenth day of Nisan]. Rather, the purport thereof is to state <i>that at the place which the Eternal thy G-d chose to establish His name in, there thou shalt</i> observe [the commandment concerning] the Passover-offering at night, <i>at the going down of the sun</i>, which is <i>the time thou camest forth out of Egypt</i>. It is concerning this performance that Scripture says [in the following verse], <i>And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">161</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 7.</i> mentioned. The sacrifice itself is called <i>zevach</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">163</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban’s intent is to clarify that the word <i>tizbach — There thou shalt ‘tizbach’ the Passover-offering</i> — does not mean “slaughter,” in which case it would necessarily be referring to the afternoon of the fourteenth day of Nisan. Instead, Ramban proceeds to show that the word <i>zevach</i> refers to the sacrifice itself, and the verse therefore refers to the eating thereof which takes place on the following night of the fifteenth day. All this, however, is from the standpoint of the plain meaning of Scripture. Ramban has already noted that the Rabbis in the Talmud (see Note 125), as well as Rashi in his commentary to Deuteronomy 16:6, have explained <i>tizbach</i> as “slaughter.”</i> as Scripture says, <i>Thou shalt not offer the blood of ‘zivchi’</i> (<i>My sacrifice</i>) <i>upon leaven</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">164</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 34:25.</i> which means “My Passover-offering.”<br>This then is the purport of the whole chapter [in Deuteronomy]: <i>Observe the month of Aviv, and observe the Passover unto the Eternal thy G-d; for in the month of Aviv the Eternal thy G-d brought thee forth out of Egypt by night</i>, etc. <i>Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">165</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 16:1-3.</i> Thus He mentioned the observance of the Passover-offering and the night, [clearly indicating that in those verses, He refers only to the time of the eating of the Passover-offering, which occurs on the night of the fifteenth day, and not to the slaughtering thereof which takes place in the afternoon of the fourteenth day]. Commanding how they are to eat it, He then mentioned that [we must eat no leavened bread] for seven days.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">166</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 3.</i> But in this entire chapter, there is not a single reference to the fourteenth day of Nisan on which the slaughtering of the Passover-offering takes place.

The purport of the verse is as follows: <i>And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire</i>, and with unleavened bread with bitter herbs, they shall eat it. [The word <i>al</i> here thus means “with,” and not “upon,” as it generally does.] Similarly: <i>‘al’ unleavened bread and bitter herbs</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">169</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 9:11.

Scripture does not say <i>im</i> (with) [but instead uses <i>al</i>] in order to instruct that it is not obligatory to wrap them together, [i.e., insert the paschal meat and the bitter herbs between the unleavened bread], and eat them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">172</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hillel in fact did wrap them together and eat them. The Sages, however, differed with him and held it not to be obligatory to eat them in that way (Pesachim 115a). As is known, nowadays at the performance of the <i>Seder</i> on the night of Passover, the wrapping together of unleavened bread and bitter herbs is observed “according to the custom of Hillel.”</i> Thus [the word <i>umatzoth</i> (<i>and unleavened bread</i>)] is missing the letter <i>beth</i>, [which would make it <i>ubematzoth</i> (and with unleavened bread)], similar to the expressions: <i>they shall wash ‘mayim’</i> (water)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">173</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 30:20.</i> [the word missing a <i>beth</i>, which would make it <i>b’mayim</i>, (with water)]; <i>And Seled died ‘lo’</i> (<i>no</i>) <i>children</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">174</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Chronicles 2:30.</i> [the word <i>lo</i> missing a <i>beth</i>, which would make it <i>b’lo</i> (without) children]. Thus Scripture teaches that there is no commandment for eating the bitter herbs alone, but only with the eating of the flesh of the Passover-offering.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">175</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus nowadways when we have no Passover-offering, we are not obligated by law of the Torah to eat bitter herbs. It is by law of the Rabbis that we are now obligated to eat bitter herbs at the <i>Seder</i> (Mishneh Torah, Hilchoth Chametz Umatzah, 7:12).</i> Concerning unleavened bread, however, Scripture repeated it by commanding, <i>At even ye shall eat unleavened bread</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">176</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 18.</i> even by itself [when there is no Passover-offering], as is the opinion of our Rabbis.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">177</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Pesachim 120a.</i><br>A more correct interpretation is that we say that the word, <i>umatzoth</i> (and unleavened bread), is connected with the earlier part of the verse: <i>And they shall eat the flesh … and unleavened bread</i>. The verse then continues to command that the flesh mentioned be eaten with bitter herbs. Thus He commanded the eating of the flesh with the eating of the unleavened bread, but He did not command the eating of bitter herbs, except by saying that they should eat the meat with bitter herbs, thus hinting that there is no [separate] commandment regarding the bitter herbs. It is only that the meat must be eaten with them, and when there is no Passover-offering there is no specific commandment [of the Torah] regarding the eating of the bitter herbs. It also teaches us that the bitter herbs do not invalidate the meat. Thus, if one ate the meat of the Passover-offering and did not eat bitter herbs, he has [nevertheless] fulfilled his duty of eating the Passover-offering, since the commandment concerning the eating of the Passover-offering is like the commandment of eating unleavened bread, each one an independent commandment in itself.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">178</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For further discussion of this topic, see “The Commandments,” Soncino, Vol. I, pp. 65-67.</i>"

This Midrash is now practically lost except for some sections found in the Tanchuma.

The teachings of the Rabbis of the Land of Israel on the Mishnah were assembled in the Jerusalem Talmud, while those of Babylon were gathered together in the Babylonian Talmud. To this day, Talmudic study is devoted almost exclusively to the Babylonian Talmud.

It does not, however, cover the entire Book of Exodus. The text mentioned by Ramban is found here on the verse before us.</i> “<i>No manner of work shall be done in them</i>. This means that neither you nor your fellow-Israelite shall do any work, nor shall a non-Israelite do your work. You so interpret it to mean that neither you nor your fellow-Israelite shall do any work, nor shall a non-Israelite do your work, but perhaps it rather means that neither you nor your fellow-Israelite shall do any work, and the non-Israelite shall not do even his own work! Scripture therefore says, <i>Six days shall work be done</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">206</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 23:3. The verse continues, <i>but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of work</i>. See my Hebrew commentary, p. 330, for a detailed explanation of how the principle discussed is derived from the language of the verse.</i> This teaches that neither you nor your fellow-Israelite shall do any work [on the Sabbath], but the non-Israelite may do his own work. These are the words of Rabbi Yashiya. Rabbi Yonathan says that there is no need for this proof. Has it not already been said, <i>Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">207</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 20:9.</i> Now by the syllogism of <i>kal vachomer</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">208</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “a minor and major.” This is a form of reasoning by which a certain stricture applying to a minor matter is established as applying all the more to a major matter. Conversely, if a certain leniency applies to a major matter, it must apply all the more to the minor matter. It is one of the thirteen rules by which the Torah is interpreted.</i> we proceed as follows: If on the Sabbath, in regard to which the Torah is so strict, you are not admonished against a non-Israelite’s work as you are against your own work, [it is logical to assume that on a Festival-day, in regard to which the Torah is not so strict — inasmuch as preparation of food is permitted on a Festival-day but not on the Sabbath — you are surely not admonished against a non-Israelite’s work as you are against your own work].” Thus far extends the text of this Beraitha.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">209</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “outside.” A teaching of the Tannaim that for some reason had not been included in the Mishnah by Rabbi Yehudah Hanasi. The teachings contained in the Mechilta on the Book of Exodus, Sifra on Leviticus, and Sifre on Numbers and Deuteronomy fall into the category of Beraithoth.</i> Now surely this is but a case of a mere <i>asmachta</i>, [a Scriptural text used as a mere support for a Rabbinical enactment]. Since they aimed to prohibit, by law of the Rabbis, telling a non-Israelite to do our work [on a Sabbath or Festival], they used this verse as a support, [but it is actually a Rabbinical law]. It is however permissible for a non-Israelite to do his own work.

In the case before us, the word <i>s’or</i> (leaven) appears here in Verse 19 where “home” is mentioned, and is also mentioned further, 13:7, where the border is mentioned. Now in the case of the border, the Torah clearly stated that the prohibition applies only where it actually belongs to the owner. On the strength of the <i>gzeirah shavah</i>, the same law applies to the case of the home. The <i>gzeirah shavah</i> is one of the thirteen rules by which the Torah is interpreted.

And thus it is taught in the Mechilta:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">219</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mechilta on the verse before us.</i> “<i>In your homes</i>. Why is this said?

Scripture therefore says, <i>in your homes;</i> just as what is in your home is under your control, so also what is <i>in thy border</i> must be under your control. Thus there is excluded [from this prohibition] an Israelite’s leavened bread which he deposited with a non-Israelite. Even though the Israelite may destroy it, he could not do so because he does not have complete control over it. [Also] excluded [from this prohibition] is the leavened bread of a non-Israelite which is deposited with an Israelite, and [an Israelite’s] leavened bread buried under debris, for although it is under the control of the Israelite [or in his territory], he has not the right to destroy it, [or in the case of debris, he does not have the physical ability of actually destroying it], etc.”<br>The explanation of this Mechilta is as follows: One might have thought that the intent of the verse, <i>Neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy borders</i>, is to prohibit the leaving of our leavened bread in all our borders, even in the house of a non-Israelite.

If you do not say thus, then it should follow that for his own leavened bread, an Israelite will transgress the commandments even if he deposited it with a non-Israelite who is beyond the sea, while for a non-Israelite’s leavened bread, even though it be in the Israelite’s home, the Israelite does not violate the prohibitions. If that is the case, why does Scripture say [in one place], <i>in your homes</i>, and in another, <i>in thy borders</i>, when there is no difference between our homes and our borders and the homes and borders of the non-Israelites! Instead, we must conclude that by law of the Torah, we are admonished [against keeping and seeing leaven or leavened bread] only when it is in our control.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">221</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hence by law of the Torah, an Israelite who deposited his leavened bread with a non-Israelite is not dutybound to destroy it. It is by law of the Rabbis, Ramban continues, that he is bound to destroy it in that case.</i> But by enactment of the Sofrim, [the Rabbis of the pre-tannaitic period beginning with Ezra], we are obligated to destroy our leavened bread under all circumstances.<br>Accordingly, the Rabbis have said in the Gemara:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">222</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Pesachim 6a. See above, Note 204, for the word Gemara.</i> “If the Israelite singled out a room [to the non-Israelite and said to him, ‘This corner is for you to keep your leavened bread’], the Israelite does not violate [the prohibitions against keeping or seeing leavened bread in his possession].” This teaches us that for a non-Israelite’s leavened bread for which the Israelite <i>has</i> accepted responsibility, even though it be deemed as belonging to the Israelite, it is forbidden only when it is under the control of the Israelite, but if it be under the control of the non-Israelite, it is permissible. [In this case where the Israelite singled out a room for him to keep his leavened bread, “it is as if the Israelite assumed responsibility for the non-Israelite’s leavened bread which is in the non-Israelite’s home”], and even by law of the Rabbis, nothing was decreed against it. The Rabbi [Rashi], however, is not of this opinion in his commentary on the Gemara Pesachim.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">223</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his commentary (Pesachim 6 b), Rashi explains that the case of the Israelite who singled out a room for the non-Israelite to keep his leavened bread, applies only if the Israelite did not assume responsibility. If he assumed responsibility for it, he transgresses the prohibitions entailed. Ramban’s position that the above case applies even if the Israelite assumed responsibility for the non-Israelite’s leavened bread, coincides with that of Rabbeinu Tam, mentioned in Tosafoth there.</i><br>It is this principle which is the purport of the Beraitha<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">209</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “outside.” A teaching of the Tannaim that for some reason had not been included in the Mishnah by Rabbi Yehudah Hanasi. The teachings contained in the Mechilta on the Book of Exodus, Sifra on Leviticus, and Sifre on Numbers and Deuteronomy fall into the category of Beraithoth.</i> we have cited: “Thus there is excluded [from this prohibition] leavened bread owned by a non-Israelite which is deposited with an Israelite.” [It is excluded] on account of the analogy between the homes and the borders:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">224</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Note 217 above. And not, as Rashi explained, that it is derived from the expression <i>in your homes</i>, as explained above.</i> just as in the case of the borders it is permissible because it says <i>with thee</i>, meaning, “you may not see [leaven or leavened bread] which is yours, but you may see that of others and that which belongs to the Temple-treasury,” so too in the case of the home it is also permissible. Excluded also is the case of an Israelite’s leavened bread buried under great debris where it is impossible for him to clear away the ruin, and it is lost to him and everyone. It is permissible since it is no longer called “his.”"

Rabbi Yonathan says that the word came out from the mouth of Moses saying it to the elders, and the elders saying it to all Israel.” Thus according to Rabbi Yashiya, the expression, <i>Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel</i>, means that he told them to gather together to him all the people, [and he himself told the people all the laws of the Passover mentioned above], as I have explained.

Rather, Rashi should have said, “for on <i>that night</i> permission to destroy was given the angel of destruction, and therefore He warned them against it.” But the Rabbi [Rashi] did not find it correct to say so since the Holy One, blessed be He, in His Presence and in His glory, was the One who smote [the first-born].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">244</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hence there was nothing unique about this night as far as the destroying angel was concerned since he had no special function that night, and yet the Israelites were warned against going out of the door of their homes until the morning!

Now on every other night, if a person goes out and he is harmed by them, the profaning of G-d’s Name is not entailed. But on the night of Passover, if an Israelite were to be harmed, the Egyptians would say that Moses was not a true prophet, and G-d’s Name would be profaned.

It was authored by Rabbi Yosei ben Chalafta, a disciple of Rabbi Akiba. The text quoted here is found in Chapter 1.</i> “Our father Abraham was seventy years old when G-d spoke to him at the ‘covenant between the parts,’ as it is said, <i>And it came to pass at the end of four hundred and thirty years … that all the hosts of the Eternal went out from the land of Egypt</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">305</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 41 here. “And you cannot find four hundred and thirty years unless the “covenant between the parts” took place thirty years before the birth of Isaac” (Yaakov Emden, in his commentary on the Seder Olam).</i> Then he returned to Haran and stayed there five years, as it is said, <i>And Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran</i>.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">302</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 12:4.</i> The sense of the verse then is to state that when Abraham finally left Haran, his native land, never to return again to his father’s house, he was seventy-five years old.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">306</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And the “covenant between the parts” accordingly took place five years before his final departure from Haran, since from the time of the covenant to the birth of Isaac, as Rashi stated, thirty years had passed.</i><br>In line with the plain meaning of Scripture, it is my opinion that G-d said to Abraham, “<i>Know of a surety that</i> before I give you this land, <i>thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs</i> for a long time — <i>four hundred years</i>.” He did not care to mention the additional thirty years<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">307</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban thus introduced a new explanation to help solve the problem, which was as follows: Since in Genesis 15:13, the length of the exile was foretold to be four hundred years, how is it that Scripture mentions here in Verse 40 an additional thirty years? Rashi answered that the four-hundred year period represents the time from Isaac’s birth till the exodus, and the additional thirty years represent the preceding years that elapsed between “the covenant between the parts” and the birth of Isaac. Accordingly, we were forced to say that the covenant took place five years before Abraham’s final departure from Haran. Ramban suggests that the intent of the verse in Genesis 15:13 is also four hundred and thirty years, for although the additional thirty years are not clearly written in the verse, they are nevertheless alluded to, as is explained further on. In his commentary on the following verse, Ramban will revert to this theme for further elucidation.</i> to him [i.e., Abraham], because He told him further on, <i>And in the fourth generation they shall come back hither</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">308</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 15:16.</i> thereby informing him that they will not come back immediately at the end of four hundred years until the fourth generation when the sin of the Amorite will be full.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">308</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 15:16.</i> Thus He alluded to these thirty years, for the Israelites’ staying in the desert for forty years was not on account of the sin of the Amorite not yet being full, [since the four hundred and thirty years were completed at the time of the exodus; their stay in the desert was on account of their own misdeeds].<br>Accordingly, the purport of the verse [before us] is as follows: Now the time that the children of Israel dwelt in Egypt was until four hundred and thirty years, since they lived there in order to fulfill the period of time set [for Abraham’s seed] to live in a land that is not theirs. Thus Scripture informed us that now when they went forth from Egypt, the exile decreed upon them was completed. He brought them forth from servitude to [complete] freedom, and it was not that He took them out from Egypt and they were yet to be strangers in a land not their own. Now because He has already mentioned this matter and informed us thereof [in the section of the “covenant between the parts”], there was no need to prolong it [here], for this verse [here] is intended only to inform us of the thirty years that were added to [the four hundred years mentioned specifically to Abraham]. This is why He says it briefly, i.e., that in Egypt were completed the four hundred years mentioned to their father Abraham and known to them, and an additional thirty years. Then He reverts and says, <i>And it came to pass at the end of four hundred and thirty years</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">309</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 41.</i> of their exile, <i>they went out from the land of Egypt</i> to perpetual freedom.<br>A similar case is the verse, <i>And the days in which we came from Kadesh — barnea, until we were come over the brook Zered were thirty and eight years</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">310</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 2:14.</i> This is to complete the reckoning. The journey from Kadesh–barnea to the brook Zered did not take thirty-eight years. Instead, they abode in Kadesh many years,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">311</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 1:46.</i> and then they journeyed from there and turned back by the way to the Red Sea,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">312</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 2:1.</i> and in the thirty-eighth year they went over the brook Zered. The purport of the verse is thus: <i>and the days in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we were come over the brook Zered were</i> until <i>thirty and eight years</i> had passed. Similarly: <i>Happy is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">313</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Daniel 12:12.</i> means [happy is he who waits and reaches] the end of those days, not the days themselves."

When he stood before Pharaoh, Jacob was one hundred and thirty years old (<i>ibid.</i>, 47:9). We thus have one hundred and ninety years since the birth of Isaac. Deduct them from the sum of four hundred and thirty, and you have two hundred and forty years remaining for the stay in Egypt.</i> But this too in my opinion is not correct according to the plain meaning of Scripture, since all the days of Abraham cannot be counted as exile with respect to his seed.<br>The correct interpretation is that He was saying to Abraham “<i>that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs … four hundred years</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">299</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 15:13. <i>And they shall serve them, and they shall afflict them four hundred years</i>.</i> from this day on.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">316</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., from the time of the “covenant between the parts.” According to Ramban, who is now following the simple meaning of Scripture, this covenant took place after Abram had left Haran when he was seventy-five years old or thereabout. Thus at the time of the covenant, Abraham was about eighty years old, and not seventy, as we reasoned before according to Rashi. (See beginning of Verse 40.)</i> The purport thereof was to tell him: “your children will not immediately inherit this land which I give them, but instead they will be strangers like you were, in a land not theirs [for a period of] four hundred years and more. They will not return here till the fourth generation<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">308</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 15:16.</i> when four hundred and thirty years will be completed.” But if so, then their stay in Egypt lasted about two hundred and twenty years or thereabouts.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">317</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to Ramban’s interpretation, Abraham was about eighty years old at the time of the covenant. (See Note above). It was twenty years from then until Isaac’s birth, since Scripture states that Abraham was one hundred years old when Isaac was born. Isaac was sixty years old when Jacob was born, and when Jacob stood before Pharaoh, he was one hundred and thirty. Thus we have two hundred and ten years. Deduct them from four hundred and thirty, and you are left with two hundred and twenty, which is the length of time they stayed in Egypt.</i> Now if the numerical value of the word <i>‘r’du’</i> (<i>get you down</i>) <i>thither</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">318</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 42:2. These were Jacob’s words to his sons upon sending them to buy food in Egypt. He did not use the word <i>l’chu</i> (go you), but <i>r’du (get you down)</i>, because the numerical value of the word <i>r’du</i> is two hundred and ten. There was thus an allusion here to the time the Israelites would stay in Egypt.</i> [which is two hundred and ten], be an established tradition in Israel, it is possible that [Jacob, by using the word <i>r’du</i>], alluded to those who arrived in Egypt that after Jacob’s death they would stay there two hundred and ten years. With the seventeen years that Jacob lived in the land of Egypt,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">319</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 47:28.</i> their stay altogether totalled two hundred and twenty-seven years.<br>And I have already mentioned<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">320</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 15:13 (in Vol. I, <i>Seder Lech Lecha</i>, p. 203).</i> the explanation of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra that the expression, <i>that thy seed shall be a stranger</i>, means “in servitude and affliction until the end of a four-hundred year period commencing from this day of the covenant.” And Ibn Ezra further said that the thirty additional years [mentioned here in Verses 40-41] represent the time that elapsed between Abraham’s departure from his country<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">321</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., his native country, Ur of the Chaldees. From there he went with his father to Haran, where they stayed five years, and then Abraham left for the land of Canaan. He was then seventy-five years old. Twenty-five years later when Isaac was born, the thirty year period, commencing from the time he left Ur of the Chaldees, was thus completed (Ibn Ezra).</i> [and the day of the covenant]. Accordingly, the explanation of the verse here is as follows: “<i>Now the time that the children of Israel dwelt in Egypt</i> until the end of the period when they and their ancestors were strangers in a land not theirs, <i>was four hundred and thirty years</i>.”<br>I maintain further that the most lucid explanation of all is that we say that the decree of the four-hundred year period, [as mentioned in Genesis 15:13], is to be reckoned from that day [of the “covenant between the parts],” as we have mentioned, and these thirty additional years — [in Verses 40-41 here] — were due to the sin of that generation. If exile and affliction are decreed upon a person for a year or two because of his sin and he will fully continue to add to his transgressions, exile and visitation of seven times<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">322</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Leviticus 26:28.</i> the original magnitude will be his lot; his first punishment is no guarantee against his being punished for the additional sin he committed. Now it had been decreed upon Abraham that his children would be strangers in a land not their own [for a period of] four hundred years, and that they will not return until the fourth generation, <i>for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">308</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 15:16.</i> Abraham was given no assurance [concerning the precise ending of the exile], except in the promise, <i>And afterward they will come out with great substance</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">323</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 15:14.</i> and that [“afterward”] could be immediately [after the four-hundred year period] or some subsequent time. Even that promise was given conditionally, as He said, <i>And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge; and afterward shall they come out with great substance</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">323</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 15:14.</i> meaning that He will bring them to judgment to determine whether they did to Israel in accordance with their deeds and as was decreed upon them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">324</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For fuller explanation of this point, see Vol. I, pp. 204-205.</i> Besides, no assurance is immune to annulment because of subsequent sin unless it is accompanied by an oath. And it is a known fact that the Israelites in Egypt were wicked and exceeding sinners, having also done away with circumcision, as it is written, <i>And they rebelled against Me, and would not hearken unto Me; they did not every man cast away the detestable things of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt; then I said I would pour out My fury upon them in the midst of the land of Egypt</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">325</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 20:8.</i> Again it says, <i>And put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the River, and in Egypt, and serve ye the Eternal</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">326</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 24:14.</i> It was for this reason that He prolonged their exile for thirty years.<br>In fact, it should have been prolonged even more, but on account of their cries and many prayers, [it was shortened to thirty years]. This is the sense of the verses: <i>And the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto G-d;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">327</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 2:23.</i> <i>And G-d heard their groaning</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">328</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 24.</i> <i>And now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto Me</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">329</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 3:9.</i> And it further states, <i>And we cried unto the Eternal, the G-d of our fathers, and the Eternal heard our voice, and saw our affliction, and our toil, and our oppression</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">330</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 26:7.</i> since they did not deserve to be redeemed on account of the end [of the four-hundred year period], but only because He accepted their cry and their groaning on account of the great agony they were in, as I have explained in <i>Seder V’eileh Shemoth</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">331</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 2:25.</i> Why should the earlier scholars — [i.e., Rashi and Ibn Ezra] — find it difficult to explain that their exile was prolonged after the end [of the four-hundred year period] by thirty years, when on account of the sin of the spies their stay in the wilderness was later prolonged forty years!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">332</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 14:34.</i> Those forty years were indeed an affliction to them, as Scripture states, <i>And thou shalt remember all the way which the Eternal thy G-d hath led thee these forty years in the wilderness, that He might afflict thee</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">333</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 8:2.</i> And it further says, <i>And He afflicted thee, and suffered thee to hunger</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">334</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 4.</i> Thus they were subject [in the wilderness] to complete exile in a land given over to <i>serpents, fiery serpents, and scorpions</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">335</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 15.</i> and the promise, <i>And in the fourth generation they shall come back hither</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">308</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 15:16.</i> was not fulfilled in them, since during those forty years, that generation surely passed away after the [fifth] generation was already born.

Rabbi Yosei says that first-fruits are not brought from beyond the Jordan since it is not a land flowing with milk and honey.” Thus the land of the two nations, [the Perizzite and the Girgashite], were excluded from the law of first-fruits because theirs is not a land flowing with milk and honey, and for the same reason, Rabbi Yosei also excluded the land beyond the Jordan, which belonged to the Amorite.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">375</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 32:33.</i> And the Amorite mentioned here [among the five nations whose land was flowing with milk and honey], is the Amorite who lived in the Land of Israel proper.

The intent of Ramban’s words here that Rashi experienced difficulty in explaining this text in Deuteronomy 18:2 is thus clear.

The phylactery of the arm contains one interior chamber which contains but one single scroll upon which all four sections of the Law are inscribed together. For fuller discussion of the subject, see “The Commandments,” Vol. I, p. 18-19.</i> just as we have received their form from the holy fathers<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">407</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A reference to the Sages of the Talmud, who received the true Tradition of the Torah.</i> who saw the prophets and the ancient ones up to Moses our teacher doing so.<br>Now the fundamental reason of this commandment is that we lay the script of the exodus from Egypt upon the hand and upon the head opposite the heart and the brain, which are the pivots of thought. Thus we are to inscribe [on parchment] the Scriptural sections of <i>Kadesh</i> (<i>Sanctify unto Me</i>) [Verses 1-10], and <i>V’haya ki y’viacha</i> (<i>And it shall be when the Eternal shall bring thee</i>) [Verses 11-16], and enclose them in the phylacteries because of this commandment wherein we were charged to make the exodus from Egypt for frontlets between our eyes. [We are also to inscribe and enclose in the phylacteries the sections of] <i>Sh’ma</i> (<i>Hear O Israel</i>) [Deuteronomy 6:4-9] and <i>V’haya im shamo’a</i> (<i>And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken</i>) [<i>ibid.</i>, 11:13-21] because we are charged to have the commandments [of the Torah] also for frontlets between our eyes, as it is written: <i>And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be upon thy heart</i>;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">408</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 6:6.</i> <i>and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">409</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 8.</i> This is why we also inscribe [on parchment] these two sections — [<i>Sh’ma</i> and <i>V’haya im shamo’a</i>] — for frontlets [even though the exodus is not mentioned in them], for they contain the commandments of the Unity of G-d, the memorial of all commandments, the doctrine of retribution, which states that the consequence of disobeying the commandments is punishment and that blessings come in the wake of obedience — and the whole foundation of the faith.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">410</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“The whole foundation of the faith.” This may refer to the principle of the Unity of G-d which is indeed the root of faith, as Ramban describes it in Deuteronomy 6:4. However, in view of the fact that this principle has already been explicitly mentioned here by Ramban, the reference must be to some other doctrine. It is reasonable to assume that Ramban is here alluding to a point he has explained in many places — “a true principle, clearly indicated in the Torah… that in the entire scope of the Torah there are only miracles, and no nature or custom.” (See Vol. I, pp. 556-7; see also his commentary above, 6:2, and on Leviticus 26:11.) The theme appears also in his introduction to the Commentary on the Book of Job (Kithvei Haramban, Vol. I, pp. 17-19). In his “Sermon on the Perfection of the Torah,” (<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 153) as well as at the end of this <i>Seder</i>, he states clearly that “a person has no part in the Torah of Moses our teacher” unless he believes in this principle. It is thus logical to assume that “the whole foundation of the faith” mentioned here is a reference to the above principle.</i> Now of the phylactery of the arm, Scripture says, <i>And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thy hand</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">411</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 9.</i> which the Rabbis explained<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">412</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Menachoth 36b.</i> as referring to the left arm, which is opposite the heart.<br>By way of the Truth, [the mystic lore of the Cabala], the verse, <i>It is because of ‘zeh’</i> (<i>this</i>) <i>which the Eternal did for</i> me,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">413</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 8.</i> is similar to <i>‘zeh’</i> (<i>this</i>) <i>is my G-d, and I will glorify Him</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">414</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 15:2.</i> The verse here thus states that it was because of His name and His glory that He did for us and brought us forth out of Egypt. <i>And</i> “this” <i>shall be for a sign unto thee</i> on the arm of your strength,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">415</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Psalms 89:11.</i> just as it is written, <i>For Thou art the glory of their strength</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">416</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 18.</i> Thus the sign [of the phylactery] is similar to the sign of circumcision<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">417</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 17:11.</i> and the Sabbath.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">418</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 31:13.</i> And since all [emanations] are one perfect unity, which is alluded to in “the sign” on the arm, our ancestors have received the tradition from Moses, who received it from the mouth of the Almighty, that [all four sections of Scripture inscribed in the phylacteries, as described above], are encased in one compartment. This is something like Scripture says, <i>achothi kalah</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">419</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Song of Songs 5:1. Literally, “my sister, the bride,” but here interpreted on the basis of the Hebrew roots which suggest “unity” (<i>achothi</i>, my sister — <i>echad</i>, one) and “totality” (<i>kalah</i>, bride — <i>kol</i>, all), as explained in the text. See also Vol. I, p. 292, where Ramban refers to this theme.</i> because it is united and comprised of the thirty-two paths of wisdom<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">420</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sefer Yetzirah 1:1</i> [with which the world was created], and it is further written, <i>His left hand is under my head</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">421</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Song of Songs 2:6.</i><br>Then Scripture says, <i>And it shall be for a memorial between thine eyes</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">411</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 9.</i> meaning that we are to lay them at the place of remembrance, which is between the eyes, at the beginning of the brain. It is there that remembrance begins by recalling the appearances [of persons and events] after they have passed away from us. These frontlets circle around the whole head with their straps, while the loop rests directly over the base of the brain which guards the memory. And the expression, <i>between your eyes</i>, means that they are to be placed upon the middle of the head, not towards one side. It may be that in the middle of the head, there are the roots of the eyes and from these stems the power of sight. Similarly, the verse, <i>Nor make ye any baldness between your eyes for the dead</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">422</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 14:1. See Rashi, <i>ibid.</i>, that the expression <i>between the eyes</i> means on the head adjoining the forehead. See also Rashi to Leviticus 21:5.</i> [means baldness adjoining the forehead. Thus the expression <i>between your eyes</i> mentioned here in the case of the frontlets also refers to the identical place]. It is to explain this point, [i.e., that the phylactery of the head is not to be placed between the eyes, as the literal meaning of the words might indicate, but that it is to be placed upon the middle of the head adjoining the forehead], that He reverts here [in Verse 16 and instead of using the expression, <i>and for ‘a memorial’ between your eyes</i>, as stated in Verse 9], and says <i>‘ultotaphoth’ between your eyes</i>. This is in order to explain that the commandment is not fulfilled by placing the phylactery between the eyes bottomward, but rather it is to be placed high on the head where it is to be there like <i>totaphoth</i>, [and we have seen above that the word <i>totepheth</i> was used by the Rabbis for an object which lies upon the head]. He uses the plural form [<i>totaphoth</i>, and not the singular <i>totepheth</i>], because the compartments in the phylactery of the head are many, as we have received the form by Tradition.<br>And now I shall declare to you a general principle in the reason of many commandments. Beginning with the days of Enosh<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">423</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 4:26. See also Rambam, Mishneh Torah, Hilchoth Akum, 1:1, where he traces the process of intellectual degeneration by which mankind fell into gross idolatry. Ramban primarily follows here the process of deterioration as affecting the three basic principles of faith: the existence of the Creator, His providence over the world, and the truth of prophecy. The chief purpose of the commandments of the Torah is to guard Israel against deviating from these principles.</i> when idol-worship came into existence, opinions in the matter of faith fell into error. Some people denied the root of faith by saying that the world is eternal; <i>they denied the Eternal, and said: It is not He</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">424</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 5:12.</i> [Who called forth the world into existence]. Others denied His knowledge of individual matters, <i>and they say, How doth G-d know? and is there knowledge in the Most High?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">425</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 73:11.</i> Some admit His knowledge but deny the principle of providence <i>and make men as the fishes of the sea</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">426</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Habakkuk 1:14.</i> [believing] that G-d does not watch over them and that there is no punishment or reward for their deeds, for they say <i>the Eternal hath forsaken the land</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">427</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 8:12.</i> Now when G-d is pleased to bring about a change in the customary and natural order of the world for the sake of a people or an individual, then the voidance of all these [false beliefs] becomes clear to all people, since a wondrous miracle shows that the world has a G-d Who created it, and Who knows and supervises it, and Who has the power to change it. And when that wonder is previously prophesied by a prophet, another principle is further established, namely, that of the truth of prophecy, <i>that G-d doth speak with man</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">428</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 5:28.</i> and that <i>He revealeth His counsel unto His servants the prophets</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">429</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Amos 3:7.</i> and thereby the whole Torah is confirmed. This is why Scripture says in connection with the wonders [in Egypt]: <i>That thou</i> [Pharaoh] <i>mayest know that I am the Eternal in the midst of the earth</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">430</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 8:18.</i> which teaches us the principle of providence, i.e., that G-d has not abandoned the world to chance, as they [the heretics] would have it; <i>That thou mayest know that the earth is the Eternal’s</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">431</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 9:29.</i> which informs us of the principle of creation, for everything is His since He created all out of nothing; <i>That thou mayest know that there is none like Me in all the earth</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">432</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 14.</i> which indicates His might, i.e., that He rules over everything and that there is nothing to withhold Him. The Egyptians either denied or doubted all of these [three] principles, [and the miracles confirmed their truth].<br>Accordingly, it follows that the great signs and wonders constitute <i>faithful witnesses</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">433</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 8:2.</i> to the truth of the belief in the existence of the Creator and the truth of the whole Torah. And because the Holy One, blessed be He, will not make signs and wonders in every generation for the eyes of some wicked man or heretic, He therefore commanded us that we should always make a memorial or sign of that which we have seen with our eyes, and that we should transmit the matter to our children, and their children to their children, to the generations to come, and He placed great emphasis on it, as is indicated by the fact that one is liable to extinction for eating leavened bread on the Passover, and for abandoning the Passover-offering, [i.e., for not taking part in the slaughtering thereof].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">434</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 9:13.</i> He has further required of us that we inscribe upon our arms and between our eyes all that we have seen in the way of signs and wonders, and to inscribe it yet upon the doorposts of the houses, and that we remember it by recital in the morning and evening — just as the Rabbis have said: “The recital of the benediction <i>True and firm</i>, [which follows the <i>Sh’ma</i> in the morning and which terminates with a blessing to G-d for the redemption from Egypt], is obligatory as a matter of Scriptural law because it is written, <i>That thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">435</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 16:3.</i> [He further required] that we make a booth every year<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">436</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 23:42.</i> and many other commandments like them which are a memorial to the exodus from Egypt. All these commandments are designed for the purpose that in all generations we should have testimonies to the wonders so that they should not be forgotten and so that the heretic should not be able to open his lips to deny the belief in [the existence of] G-d.

The purposes of raising our voices in prayer and of the service in synagogues, as well as the merit of public prayer, is precisely this: that people should have a place wherein they assemble and express their thankfulness to G-d for having created them and supported them, and thus proclaim and say before Him, “We are your creatures.”<br>This is the intent of what the Rabbis of blessed memory have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">442</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yalkut Shimoni, Jonah 550.

The undaunted one wins over the abashed one.”<br>Through the great open miracles, one comes to admit the hidden miracles which constitute the foundation of the whole Torah, for no one can have a part in the Torah of Moses our teacher unless he believes that all our words and our events, [as dictated in the Torah], are miraculous in scope, there being no natural or customary way of the world in them, whether affecting the public or the individual. Instead, if a person observes the commandments, His reward will bring him success, and if he violates them, His punishment will cause his extinction.

Ramban will suggest further on in the text that the word <i>ki</i> should be understood here as “although.” The J.P.S. translation follows Ramban’s explanation.</i> IT WAS NEAR. “It would therefore be easy [for the Israelites] to return to Egypt by the same route. There are many Midrashic explanations, [but the above is the plain sense of Scripture].” Thus the language of Rashi. This is also the opinion of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra, who explained the purport of the verse to be that G-d led them not by the way of the land of the Philistines “because” it was near. They might therefore be filled with regret [when they experience war], and they would immediately return to Egypt.<br>In my opinion, if their explanations were correct, the expression <i>for G-d said</i> would have been mentioned in first place in the verse, in which case the verse would read: “and G-d led them not by the way of the land of the Philistines, for G-d said, Because it is near, lest peradventure the people repent!”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">But actually the verse reads: <i>and G-d led them not by the way of the land of the Philistines because it was near; for G-d said</i>, etc. In other words, Ramban argues that according to Rashi and Ibn Ezra, the reason for G-d’s choice of the route by the wilderness and not by the land of the Philistines [<i>because it was near</i>], should have followed after the expression <i>for G-d said</i>.</i> But the correct interpretation is that [the expression in question does not state the reason for G-d’s choice but merely] states that <i>G-d led them not by the way of the land of the Philistines</i> although <i>it was near</i> and it would have been advantageous to lead them by that route, for G-d said: <i>Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt</i>.<br>The reason they would experience war if they went by the way of the land of the Philistines, is that the Philistines would surely not have given them permission to go peacefully through their land, and thus they might return to Egypt.

The war of Amalek in Rephidim<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 17:8-13.</i> was no reason for the Israelites to return to Egypt, since they did not pass through the land of the Amalekites. Rather, Amalek came from his country and warred against them because of his hatred of Israel. Even if they were to take their own course to return to Egypt, it would be to no avail since Amalek would fight them on the way. Besides, they were already far from Egypt because of the circuitous route which they had followed, and they knew of no other route.<br>Now Rashi commented: “<i>When they see war</i>.

AND THEY SAID UNTO MOSES: ‘BECAUSE WERE THERE NO GRAVES IN EGYPT, HAST THOU TAKEN US TO DIE IN THE WILDERNESS’? It does not appear logical that people who are crying out to G-d to help them, should at the same time protest against the deliverance He performed for them, and say that it would have been better if He had not saved them! The correct interpretation therefore is that there were conflicting groups,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As stated in the Mechilta here on Verse 13: “The Israelites at the Red Sea were divided into four groups, etc.” In Rabbeinu Bachya’s rendition of this text of Ramban, it clearly reads: “Therefore we can rely upon the words of our Rabbis who say that these verses represent different groups” (Bachya’s Commentary on the Torah, Vol. II, p. 113, in my edition). Ramban, however, following the plain meaning of Scripture here, does not describe them as four groups but merely as ‘conflicting groups’ without enumeration.</i> and Scripture relates what all of them did. Thus it narrates that one group cried to G-d [for help], and another denied His prophet and did not acknowledge the deliverance done for them. They said it would have been better for them had He not saved them. It is with reference to this group that it is written, <i>They were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 106:7.</i> This is why Scripture here repeats in the same verse the term, <i>the children of Israel</i>, [saying: <i>and ‘the children of Israel’ lifted up their eyes</i>…] <i>and ‘the children of Israel’ cried out unto the Eternal</i>. It thus indicates that it was the better ones among the people that cried out to G-d; the remainder rebelled against His word. This is why Scripture says afterward, <i>And the people feared the Eternal; and they believed in the Eternal, and in His servant Moses</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 31.</i> It does not say “and <i>Israel</i> feared the Eternal, and they believed,” but it says instead “the people,” for the term <i>the children of Israel</i> signifies the outstanding ones, while <i>the people</i> is a name for the multitude. Similarly, the verse, <i>And the people murmured</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 15:24.</i> [clearly indicates the usage of the term <i>people</i> in Scripture].

Although they had seen the signs and wonders he did, they thought that he did them through some manner of wisdom. Perhaps G-d brought the plagues upon the Egyptians on account of their wickedness, [but not necessarily for the purpose of redemption of Israel, and Moses took them out of Egypt just to rule over them], for if G-d had desired their going out, Pharaoh would not have pursued after them.<br>And Onkelos here translated <i>vayitz’aku (and they cried out)</i> as <i>uz’aku</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Elsewhere Onkelos translates it <i>v’tzalu</i> (and they prayed). See Deuteronomy 26:7, <i>vanitz’ak</i>, which Onkelos renders <i>v’tzaleinu</i> (and we prayed). The word <i>uz’aku</i>, on the other hand, means “complaint,” as is explained in the text.</i> thus making its purport to be “complaint,” meaning that they did not pray to G-d but that they complained to Him for having taken them out of Egypt. It is similar in usage to that in the verse, <i>‘vayitz’aku’ unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 5:15.</i> [which does not mean “and they prayed,” but that they complained.] Similarly, <i>Then there was a great ‘tza’akath’ of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nehemiah 5:1.</i> which means they were complaining against them with a great voice and outcry.<br>In the Mechilta we find;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mechilta on the verse before us.</i> “They seized upon the occupation of their fathers, [i.e., at first they conducted themselves properly in that they prayed to G-d as their fathers had done]. <i>And they said unto Moses:</i> ‘<i>Because were there no graves</i>, etc.?’ After ‘they had added leaven into the dough,’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban will explain further on that this is a euphemism for the <i>yeitzer hara</i> (the evil inclination).

Thus the Sages in the Mechilta intended to say that at first the people prayed to G-d to instill in Pharaoh’s heart the desire to turn back from pursuing them. However, when they saw that he was not turning back but instead was marching and drawing near them, they said, “Our prayers have not been accepted,” and an evil thought entered their hearts to find fault with Moses as they had previously done."

It was he who dwelled in the pillar of fire and went before them by night to give them light. Therefore Scripture here mentions [not the Tetragrammaton, which indicates the attribute of mercy, but] <i>ha’Elokim</i> (G-d), [the name which denotes the attribute of justice]. It is possible that [the word <i>malach</i> (angel)] is not in a construct state [meaning “the angel of”] but instead is in apposition.<br>Now I have seen in the Mechilta of Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The standard Mechilta, a Tannaitic commentary of the Book of Exodus, is that of Rabbi Ishmael. There is another Mechilta, that of Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai, to which Ramban refers here. To distinguish it from the other, standard, work, Ramban therefore specifies it by name. For another example, see Vol. I, p. 603. The quotation mentioned here appears in Hoffman’s edition of that work on p. 49. The essence of this particular Midrash is also found here in Rashi.</i> “Rabbi Yonathan the son of Yochai asked Rabbi Shimon the son of Yochai, ‘Why is it that in all places it is written, <i>the angel of the Eternal</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">E.g., Genesis 16:7 and above, 3:2.</i> and here it is written, <i>the angel of ‘Elokim’</i> (G-d)?’ Rabbi Shimon answered him, ‘<i>Elokim</i> everywhere denotes “Judge” [literally: judgment], etc.’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“The verse thus teaches us that Israel at that moment was arraigned in judgment, i.e., whether to be saved or to be destroyed with the Egyptians” (Mechilta quoted, and also mentioned in Rashi here).</i> The Rabbis thus alluded to that which we have said.<br>Thus [the angel] now journeyed in the pillar of fire from <i>before the camp of Israel and went behind them, and the pillar of cloud from before them</i> also <i>journeyed and stood behind them</i>. Thus the two pillars were behind the camp of Israel. Scripture then reverts [in Verse 20] to explain that the pillar of cloud <i>came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel</i>, that is to say, the pillar of cloud did not intervene between the pillar of fire and the camp of Israel, but rather it interposed between the camp of Egypt and the pillar of fire.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus the order was as follows: First came the camp of Israel, followed by the pillar of fire. After that was the pillar of cloud, followed by the camp of Egypt. The two pillars thus intervened between the two camps (Bachya).</i> <i>And there was the cloud and the darkness</i> between the two camps, with the pillar of fire giving light to Israel, even though it was behind them, because it was high, [thus illuminating the way for them to pass through the sea, as explained above.] The pillar of cloud did not obstruct the illumination from reaching them as it did to the Egyptians. This is the meaning of the verse, <i>and it gave light by night</i>, since the pillar of fire illuminated the night for them.<br>This was not as on all other nights, when its function was <i>to lead them the way</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 13:21.</i> for on that night it did not go before them, [but instead the pillar of fire remained stationary]. This was so because if the pillar of fire would have gone before Israel as on other nights [when they journeyed], and the pillar of cloud was between the two camps, then the Israelites would have passed through the sea quickly. Consequently, the Egyptians would not have seen them, and they would not have come after them. However, now [that the pillar of fire was stationary] the Israelites walked slowly, and since there was no great distance between the camps, the Egyptians saw the camp of Israel from the midst of the cloud, and they followed them. They saw the fire out of the midst of the cloud,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“For he who sits in darkness can see light in the distance. But the Israelites did not see the Egyptians, for he who sits in an illuminated place cannot see one who sits in darkness” (Bachya).</i> but they were not able to approach them because of the two pillars which interposed.<br>This is the sense of the verse, <i>And the one</i> [camp] <i>came not near the other all the night</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">64</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 20.</i> <i>And it came to pass in the morning-watch, that the Eternal looked forth upon the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of cloud</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 24.</i> meaning: He removed the pillar of fire from the camp of Israel, as was customary on all days, and today He put it [in a position] overlooking the camp of Egypt. It was thus between the Egyptians and the pillar of cloud which served Israel by day.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, although the pillar of fire was between Israel and the pillar of cloud during the night, in the morning watch G-d took the pillar of fire and placed it between the camp of Egypt and the pillar of cloud. With the pillar of fire heating the Egyptians, they fell into confusion.</i> <i>And He confounded the camp of Egypt</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 24.</i> by causing the pillar of fire to bear down upon them with its great heat reaching them, and <i>the flame burned up the wicked</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">67</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 106:18.</i> Now I have already explained in the story of Creation<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 1:1.

There the reason is given why the element of fire is designated as <i>choshech</i> (darkness).</i> that the element of fire is called “darkness,” and <i>the cloud and the darkness</i> [mentioned in Verse 20] accordingly mean the pillar of fire and the pillar of cloud. To all Israel, the pillar of fire had given light because of its high position [as explained above], but now it darkened for the Egyptians, because it came together with the pillar of cloud, which caused it to darken just as the sun when covered by a cloud.

Similarly, <i>az yedabeir Yehoshua</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">93</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 10:12.

Where the action is mentioned once and once only, the future cannot be used. However, Ramban points out, in the verse, <i>Now Moses ‘yikach’ the tent</i>, where the future tense “shall take” is used, the action is not one of continuous happening and still the future tense is used!</i> since he took it only once.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">108</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Rashi further, 33:11, towards the end (“The Midrash explains, etc.”), that Moses’ removing his tent to pitch it outside the camp happened only once.</i> Instead, [we must conclude that] it is the way of Scripture to use the future tense in place of the past form, and in many places the reverse is quite usual. The reason for this is that it is a distinctive way of language for a narrator of an event to place himself at a certain point of time which he desires, and he then alludes to the event. At times, he places himself at the moment of the action, and he speaks of it in the present tense as if he is watching it from its very beginning. He would say, “Israel is singing,” as if they were singing right before him, and so also in other cases. However, at times the narrator places himself after the event and says, “This has already been done.” It is all a matter of conveying an event realistically. It is for this reason that this interchangeable use of the tenses occurs in matters of prophecy.",

It is thus obvious that Ramban understands the word <i>vayomer</i> (and he said) as a reference to Moses, and not, as rendered in some translations, “and He said.”</i> which He will command you [in the future].”<br>In line with the plain meaning of Scripture, when the Israelites began coming into <i>the great and dreadful wilderness… thirsty ground where there was no water</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">245</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 8:15.</i> Moses established customs for them concerning how to regulate their lives and affairs <i>until they come to a land inhabited</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">246</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 16:35. — “<i>Moses</i> established customs.” It should be noted that Ramban uses the expression <i>sam lahem</i> which could possibly be a reference to G-d, that “<i>He</i> established customs for them.” But in Rabbeinu Bachya’s commentary quoting Ramban he writes clearly: “In line with the plain meaning of Scripture, <i>statute and ordinance</i> are the customs how to regulate their lives in the desert, for Moses was king in Jeshurun, a leader who chastised his people and commanded them how to regulate their lives in the desert” (Bachya, Vol. II, p. 137 in my edition). On the basis of Bachya’s interpretation I have translated here: “<i>Moses</i> established customs.”</i> A custom is called <i>chok</i>, this being associated with the expressions: <i>Feed me with ‘chuki’ (my customary) bread;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">247</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 30:8.</i> <i>‘chukoth’ (the customary ways or laws) of heaven and earth</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">248</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 33:25.</i> Custom is also called <i>mishpat</i> (judgment or ordinance) because it is something measured out accurately. A similar usage [of the word <i>mishpat</i>] is found in these verses: <i>So did David, and so hath been ‘mishpato’ (his manner) all the while;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">249</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 27:11.</i> <i>After the former ‘mishpat’ (manner) when thou wast his butler;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">250</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 40:13.</i> <i>And the palace shall be inhabited upon ‘mishpato’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">251</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 30:18.</i> i.e., upon its ascertained dimension.<br>It may mean that Moses instructed them in the ways of the wilderness, namely to be ready to suffer hunger and thirst and to pray to G-d, and not to murmur. He taught them ordinances whereby they should live, to love one another, to follow the counsel of the elders, to be discreet in their tents with respect to women and children, to deal in a peaceful manner with the strangers that come into the camp to sell them various objects. He also imparted moral instructions, i.e., that they should not become like bands of marauders who do all abominable things and have no sense of shame, similar to that which the Torah commanded, <i>When thou goest forth in camp against thine enemies, then thou shalt keep thee from every evil thing</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">252</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 23:10.</i> In the case of Joshua it is also said. <i>So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">253</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 24:25.</i> Here too the expression, [<i>a statute and an ordinance</i>], does not refer to the statutes and ordinances of the Torah, but rather to the customs and ways of civilized society, such as “the conditions which Joshua made [upon entering the Land],” which the Rabbis have mentioned,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">254</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Baba Kamma 80 b-81 a: “Ten conditions did Joshua stipulate [with Israel when they came into the Land]: that all people have a right to pasture their cattle in forests [without the interference of the owner of the forest] etc.” The customs established by Joshua were thus the norms of a functioning society.</i> and other such similar regulations. And Scripture says, <i>and there he tried them</i>, in order to inform us that he [Moses] led them by such a road on which there was no water, and he brought them to a place where the waters were bitter in order to test them, even as Scripture says, <i>And He afflicted thee, and suffered thee to hunger;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">255</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 8:3.</i> <i>And that He might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">256</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 16.</i>",

This teaches us that if a person is honest in his business dealings, and the spirit of his fellow creatures finds pleasure in him, it is accounted to him as though he had fulfilled the entire Torah.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">264</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is based upon the following phrases, <i>and thou wilt give ear to His commandments, and keep all His statutes</i>. The sense thereof is thus: “If you will do that which is right in G-d’s eyes, meaning if you will be honest in your business dealings, it will be accounted to you as though you had given ear, etc.”</i> I will further explain this when I come to the verse <i>‘And thou shalt do that which is upright and good,’</i> if the good G-d will show me goodness.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">265</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ramban Deuteronomy 6:18.</i>",
                    "I WILL PUT NONE OF THE DISEASES UPON THEE, WHICH I HAVE PUT UPON THE EGYPTIANS; FOR I AM THE ETERNAL THAT HEALETH THEE. Rashi wrote: “<i>I will put none of the diseases upon thee</i>, and if I do place them [because you will not hearken to My voice], they will be as though they had not been placed, <i>for I am the Eternal that healeth thee</i>. This is the homiletic exposition. But according to the plain meaning of Scripture, the verse is to be understood in the sense of a person who says, ‘I am the physician who warns you not to eat certain things which might bring a man back to his state of disease.’” Thus far the language of Rashi.<br>But according to the plain meaning of Scripture, <i>rophecha</i> is not an adjective, [or more precisely, a noun-adjective, as Rashi would have it, meaning “Thy physician Who teaches thee how disease should not befall thee.” Instead, the meaning of the verse is “that I am the One Who heals thee.”] Besides, it is not customary that a master should assure his servants that “if you will do all my will and desire, I will not slay you with sore diseases.” None of the Divine assurances of the Torah are expressed in that way! Rather, the verse here constitutes an admonition by which He warned them not to be among those that rebel against Him as the Egyptians had been. By hearkening to His voice, they will be saved from all sickness, since that sickness deservedly comes upon all those who rebel against His will, even as it befell the Egyptians when they did not hearken to Him. This is similar to that which He said that He will put <i>upon thee all the diseases of Egypt which thou wast in dread of, and they shall cleave unto thee</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">266</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 28:60.</i> And He further said, <i>For I am the Eternal that healeth thee</i>. This constitutes a promise “that I will remove from you sickness that comes in the natural course of events, even as I healed the waters [at Marah].”<br>Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented that this sign, [i.e., making the bitter waters sweet], which was the first one done for them in the wilderness, was in contrast to the first plague that came upon the Egyptians. The waters of the [Nile] river were sweet and He changed them to be of evil effect, while these waters of Marah were bitter and He healed them. Thus it was shown that G-d does things which are contrary to each other, and therefore you should fear Him and not rebel against Him so that He should not afflict you as He did [afflict] them. You should love Him for He will bestow goodness upon you, even as He healed the waters for you. [Thus far Ibn Ezra’s comment.]<br>Now on the matter of Scripture making use here of two expressions, saying, “His commandments, His statutes,” and concluding, <i>I will put none of the diseases upon thee, for I am the Eternal</i>, [thus using the third-person and first-person pronouns in the same verse], I have already <i>written you three times</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">267</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 22:20, according to Jonathan ben Uziel’s translation. Ramban uses the expression here in a figurative sense, meaning: “I have already elucidated this matter in other places.” See Vol. I, pp. 260-261. See also further, 24:2.</i> on the explanation thereof. [Here] it can be understood from the word <i>‘l’kol’ (to the voice)</i> and the word <i>‘ani’ (I)</i>, which convey the thought that if we shall listen to the voice of our G-d to keep G-d’s commandments and His statutes, the Glorious Name will be our healer. It is on the basis [of the verse] that the Sages instituted [the formula of] benedictions [which contain two different pronouns, thus: “Blessed art <i>Thou</i> O Eternal, our G-d, King of the universe,] Who hast sanctified us with <i>His</i> commandments and hast commanded us.” The benedictions contain an expression of acknowledgment of G-d’s Sovereignty, [saying as we do, “our G-d, King of the universe”], and the commandments have been given to us <i>from everlasting even to everlasting</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">268</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Chronicles 16:36.</i> The student learned [in the mystic lore of the Cabala] will understand.<br>And I will enlighten you [on this matter]. All benedictions which contain an expression of His Sovereignty are so formulated that they show respect to the Sovereign of the universe, Who has sanctified us [by His commandments] and Who has done [a certain deed] for us. But where a benediction follows another one, in which case the Sovereignty of G-d is not mentioned,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">269</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Such is an established rule in the prayers. The opening benediction starts: <i>Baruch atah Hashem Elokeinu melech ha’olam (Blessed art Thou, O Eternal, King of the universe…)</i>, the Sovereignty of G-d thus being acknowledged in the second person, i.e., as the One directly addressed. But the benediction concludes with a reference to that Sovereign in the third person, thus concluding, “Who has sanctified us by <i>His</i> commandments.” The following benedictions do not open with a reference to G-d’s Sovereignty, but instead continue throughout in the second person. For example, in the Grace after the meal, the first benediction begins: “Blessed art <i>Thou</i>, O Eternal our G-d, <i>King of the universe</i>, Who sustains the whole world with <i>His</i> goodness… <i>He giveth</i> food to all flesh….” The second benediction begins: “We thank <i>Thee</i>, O Eternal our G-d, for the goodly and ample land of our desire which <i>Thou</i> gavest….” It should be noted that this rule applies only where a number of benedictions relate to one unit of prayer, such as the Grace after the Meal, or the Morning <i>Sh’ma</i>, the Evening <i>Sh’ma</i>, etc. Where the benedictions consist of short unrelated statements, such as the blessings of thanksgiving with which the Morning Service begins, each benediction contains an expression of G-d as the Sovereign of the universe.</i> it is formulated in the second-person, such as [the benedictions beginning]: “Thou art Mighty,” “Thou art Holy,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">270</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These are the second and third benedictions of the <i>Sh’moneh Esreh</i> [literally: the “Eighteen” Blessings — the central prayer around which the regular daily services are built]. They do not begin with a reference to G-d’s Sovereignty, and therefore are formulated in the second person: “<i>Thou</i> art Mighty;” “<i>Thou</i> art Holy.” It should be noted that in the first benediction of the <i>Sh’moneh Esreh</i>, although there is no reference to G-d as the Sovereign of the universe, the expression “G-d of Abraham” is deemed equivalent to “King of the universe,” since Abraham was the first to acknowledge His Sovereignty over the whole universe. See my Hebrew commentary, p. 361.</i> and so all the others. The prayer of <i>Aleinu l’shabei’ach</i> (“It is for us to praise the Lord of all things,” a prayer which begins the three special sections of the New Year Additional Service], was designated in the third-person [even though it is not preceded by a benediction in which G-d’s Sovereignty is mentioned], because we mention therein, “And we bend the knee and bow low and offer thanks before the Supreme King of kings.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">271</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When one stands in His very presence, it is not proper to address prayer to Him in the second person.

I have however, seen here in the Mechilta: “Rabbi Eleazar of Modaim said: ‘On the very day that the Holy One, blessed be He, created His world, He created twelve springs corresponding to the twelve tribes of Israel, and seventy palm trees corresponding to the seventy elders.’” Scripture thus tells that each tribe encamped beside his spring and the elders sat in their shade praising G-d for them, because He had prepared for them [such a restful place] in a land of drought.

Yet, as Ramban concludes, they have a common association, as is explained in the text.</i> Scripture makes use of both terms when speaking of every form of “falling from above.” Thus it is called <i>matarah</i> (target) because they come down like arrows [on a target], and it says, <i>‘vayamteir’ (And He caused to rain) upon them flesh as the dust, and winged fowl as the sand of the seas</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">299</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 78:27.</i> It may be that [Scripture does not use the term <i>mamtir</i> for every form of “falling from above,” but only] for the fowl of heaven. [Therefore, the term, <i>vayamteir</i> in the above — mentioned verse refers only to the winged fowl] because they came down upon them as the rain.",
                    "BREAD. Because they made bread out of the manna — as it is written, <i>and they made cakes of it</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">300</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 11:8.</i> — [Scripture calls it <i>lechem</i> (bread)], for every form of bread is called <i>lechem</i>, not just those of wheat and barley. It says <i>cause to rain bread</i> [although it did not come down in the form of bread, for the meaning thereof is] that He is causing it to come down for them to make it into bread. Similarly: <i>As for the earth, out of it cometh bread</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">301</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 28:5.</i> [meaning: “out of it cometh the wheat from which bread is made”]. So also: <i>To bring forth bread out of the earth</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">302</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 104:14.</i> which means that He brings forth the wheat from which people make bread. And some scholars<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">303</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ibn Ezra, and R’dak in his Sefer Hashorashim, under the root <i>lechem</i>.</i> interpret: <i>Behold, I will cause to rain bread</i>, meaning food. Similarly: <i>‘lechem’ of the offering;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">304</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 3:16.</i> <i>For he offereth the ‘lechem’ of thy G-d;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">305</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 21:8.</i> <i>When thou sittest ‘lilchom’ with a ruler</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">306</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 23:1.</i> — all are expressions of food.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">307</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus is the opinion of Ibn Ezra and R’dak (see Note 303). But, continues Ramban, the correct interpretation is, etc.</i> The correct interpretation is that <i>lilchom</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">306</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 23:1.</i> means “to eat bread,” and <i>‘lechem’ of thy G-d</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">305</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 21:8.</i> is a euphemism, meaning that it is “the food” for G-d even as bread is for man, for we find it said, <i>Man doth not live by bread only</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">308</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 8:3.</i>",
                    "THAT I MAY TRY THEM, WHETHER THEY WILL WALK IN MY LAW OR NOT. “I.e., whether they will observe the commandments associated with it, such as [the laws] that they should not leave [a remainder] of it until the morning<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">309</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 19.</i> and that they should not go out on the Sabbath to collect it.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">310</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 26.</i> Thus the language of Rashi.<br>But this is not correct.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">311</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban’s objection seems to be that the word <i>l’ma’an</i> (“that” or “for the sake of”) — <i>‘that’ I may try them</i> — expresses causation in itself, namely, that the manna as such will be their trial, as will be explained, and not the precepts associated with it, as Rashi explained.</i> Rather, the intent [of the trial mentioned here] is as He said, <i>Who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not; that He might afflict thee, and that He might try thee, to do thee good at thy latter end</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">312</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 8:16.</i> [The manna itself] was a trial to them, since they had no food in the wilderness and were without recourse to any sustenance except the manna, which they knew not from before and had never heard of from their fathers. Each day’s quantity came down on its day, and they were eagerly desirous for it. Yet with all this, they hearkened to walk after G-d to a place of no food. And so indeed He said to them again, <i>And thou shalt remember all the way in which the Eternal thy G-d hath led thee these forty years in the wilderness, that He might afflict thee, to try thee, to know what was in thy heart, whether thou wouldest keep His commandments, or no</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">313</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 2.</i> He could have led them by way of <i>the cities that were round about them</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">314</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 35:5.</i> Instead, He led them <i>through the wilderness wherein were serpents, fiery serpents, and scorpions</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">315</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 8:15.</i> and each day’s quantity of food would come to them only from heaven in order to try them and to do them good at the end so that they would believe in Him forever. I have already explained the matter of “trial” in the commentary on the verse, <i>And G-d tried Abraham</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">316</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 22:1 (Vol. I, p. 275).</i><br>The Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] has written in the Moreh Nebuchim<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">317</sup><i class=\"footnote\">III, 24. Ramban is following Al Charizi’s translation of the Moreh Nebuchim. In Ibn Tibbon’s translation, (as rendered by Friedlander, III, p. 114): “<i>That I may prove them whether they will walk in My law or not;</i> i.e., let every one who desires try and see whether it is useful and sufficient to devote himself to the service of G-d.”</i> [on the verse before us, <i>That I may try them, whether they will walk in My law or not</i>, that it means] that “everyone capable of knowledge should know and determine whether there is usefulness in the service of G-d, and whether there is adequate satisfaction in it or not.” But if so, it would have been proper for Him to say, “that <i>He</i> may try them to know!”<br>Now Scripture mentions here only the matter of manna, which was “the bread” which He caused to rain upon them, [and it does not refer to the flesh which He gave them]. However, from that which Moses told them, <i>This shall be, when the Eternal shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">318</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 8.</i> we know that everything was told to him.

This is also the case in many places. But in the opinion of those scholars<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">321</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See above, Note 303.</i> who say that <i>lechem</i> here means “all food,” it is possible that by saying, <i>Behold, I will cause to rain ‘lechem,’</i> the meaning refers to both the manna and to the quail, i.e., that He would fulfill their request for bread and flesh. Moses explained that the flesh would be [available] to eat in the evening, and the bread would be [available] in the morning to the full, as is the customary way."

[i.e., Moses and Aaron] who have taken you out from there, as you have said, <i>for ye have brought us forth</i>.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">322</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 3.</i> 7. AND IN THE MORNING, THEN YE SHALL SEE THE GLORY OF THE ETERNAL. This does not refer to G-d’s Glory that appeared in the cloud, [mentioned further in Verse 10], for that occurred [later] in the day when Aaron spoke to them, <i>and they looked toward the wilderness and, behold, the Glory of the Eternal appeared in the cloud</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">323</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 10.</i> “But,” commented Rashi, “thus did Moses say to them: <i>At even, then ye shall know</i> that His hand has the power to give you your desire, and He will give you flesh. He will not, however, give it to you with ‘a bright countenance,’ since you were improper in asking for it, [inasmuch as one can exist without meat]. Besides, you asked for it out of a full stomach, [i.e., while still having cattle which you took along with you from Egypt]. But as regards the bread for which you properly asked out of necessity, when it falls in the morning, you will see the Glory of His countenance, as He will bring it down for you in a manner indicative of love, i.e., in the morning, while there is yet time to prepare it.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">324</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the printed Rashi text, it concludes: “and there shall be dew above it and dew below it as though it were packed in a chest.” The quail, on the other hand, came down <i>at even</i> (Verse 13) when there was not much time to prepare it. It was thus given, as the Mechilta — quoted by Ramban — said further on, <i>b’panim chasheichoth</i> (with a ‘dark countenance’), or as Rashi puts it, <i>lo b’panim me’iroth</i> (not with a ‘bright countenance’).</i><br>But it is not correct to interpret the expression, <i>and in the morning, then ye shall see the Glory of the Eternal</i> as applying to the gift of the manna because He gave it to them early in the morning. What <i>Glory of the Eternal</i> is made manifest in this? Moreover, how does it logically connect with the phrase following it, <i>for that He hath heard your murmurings?</i> And this Midrash of our Rabbis, [which Rashi mentions, i.e., that there was a difference in the ways the manna and the quail were given to them], is not like a comment upon the expression, <i>then ye shall see the Glory of the Eternal</i>. Instead, the Rabbis said it [as an explanation of the fact] that He apportioned their sustenance twice a day and did not distribute all of it in the morning. Thus the Rabbis said in the Mechilta:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">325</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mechilta on Verse 8.</i> “<i>And Moses said: ‘This shall be, when the Eternal shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full.’</i> From here, you learn that He gave them the quail with ‘a dark countenance.’ The manna, however, which they were justified in requesting, He gave them with ‘a bright countenance.’” That is to say, in the morning.<br>Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote that the expression, <i>and in the morning</i>, etc., [beginning in Verse 7], is a continuation of the previous verse. [It constitutes Moses’ answer to] what the Israelites had said, <i>for ye have brought us forth</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">326</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 3.</i> from Egypt. Moses replied: “G-d will now show two signs for you so that you may know that it was He Who brought you out from there. One, [the quail] will come in the evening of this day, and the other, [the manna] will come tomorrow in the morning.” And, [continued Ibn Ezra], it would have been proper for Scripture to say: “At even, and in the morning, then ye shall know that the Eternal hath brought you out from the land of Egypt.” The expression <i>in the morning</i> is not connected with <i>then ye shall see the Glory of the Eternal</i>, since they saw the Glory [later] on that day [and not in the following morning].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">327</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To grasp the boldness of Ibn Ezra’s explanation, one must note the following sequence of language in the two verses: (6) <i>And Moses and Aaron said… At even, then ye shall know that the Eternal hath brought you out from the land of Egypt</i>. (7) <i>And in the morning, then ye shall see the Glory of the Eternal</i>. According to Ibn Ezra’s interpretation, the expression of Verse 7, <i>and in the morning</i>, is to be understood together with <i>at even</i> (of Verse 6), thus: “at even and in the morning, then ye shall know that the Eternal hath brought you out from the land of Egypt.” The phrase, <i>and in the morning</i>, cannot be connected with <i>then ye shall see the Glory of the Eternal</i>, for as narrated in Verses 9-10, the Glory of the Eternal appeared that very same day, and not in the following morning. Ramban will further refute this explanation of Ibn Ezra on the basis of the fact that after all, the verses are not written in the way Ibn Ezra would transpose them. His own exposition will then follow.</i> But this interpretation too does not appear to be correct.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">328</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See end of above Note.</i><br>The correct interpretation appears to me to be that the wonder inherent in the manna was extremely great, whereas He brought the quail in from the sea by a wind which came from Him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">329</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 11:31.</i> The manna, however, was created for them now; [it was] a new creation in heaven, similar to the process of [the original] Creation. This is the intent of what the Rabbis have said with respect to the manna, i.e., that it was created on the sixth day of creation between sundown and nightfall.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">330</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Aboth 5:6.</i> This is why Scripture said: “By the sign He will perform for you on the coming night, you will know that He brought you out from the land of Egypt, since He prepared <i>a table in the wilderness</i> for you.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">331</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Psalms 78:19.</i> But by the great wonder He will do for you in the morning, you will see the Glory of His kingdom, <i>for what god is there in heaven or on earth that can do according to</i> His <i>works and according to</i> His <i>mighty acts?</i>”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">332</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 3:24.</i> By the great and marvellous things that G-d does, He shows His Glory, similar to that which is written, <i>I will gather all nations, and all tongues, and they shall come, and shall see My Glory</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">333</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 66:18.</i> It is further written [there], <i>and they shall declare My Glory</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">334</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 19.</i> and there are many other verses similar to this effect. So also is the opinion of Onkelos who rendered [the verse here]: “and you will <i>see</i> the Glory of G-d.” He did not translate it, “and [the Glory of G-d] will be made manifest.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">335</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Had Onkelos translated “and the Glory of G-d will be made manifest,” it would have comprised Onkelos’ effort to remove any implication of G-d’s corporeality. But now that he translated, “and you will <i>see</i> the Glory of G-d,” his reference is to the great and wonderful deed G-d will do for them through the manna.</i><br>Know that the subject of the manna involves a great matter.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">336</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Matter.” In the Ricanti quoting Ramban: “secret.”</i> Our rabbis have alluded to it in Tractate Yoma:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">337</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yoma 75b.</i> “<i>Man did eat bread of ‘abirim’ (the mighty)</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">338</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 78:25. A reference to the manna which the Israelites ate in the wilderness. The question arises about the meaning of the word <i>abirim</i>.</i> i.e., bread which the ministering angels eat! These are the words of Rabbi Akiba. Rabbi Yishmael said to him, ‘You have made a mistake. Do the ministering angels indeed eat bread? Has it not been said [by Moses], <i>I did neither eat bread nor drink water?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">339</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 9:9.</i> Rather, <i>the bread of ‘abirim’</i> means bread which was absorbed in the <i>eivarim</i> (limbs).’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">340</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Vol. I, p. 76, on the fruits of the Garden of Eden.</i><br>The purport of Rabbi Akiba’s words is that the existence of the ministering angels is sustained by the Divine Glory. And so the Rabbis interpreted:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">341</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shemoth Rabbah 32:4.</i> “<i>And Thou ‘m’chayeh’ (preservest) them all</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">342</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nehemiah 9:6.</i> [means] He gives food (<i>‘michyah’</i>) to you all.” It is with reference to this that it is said, <i>And the light is sweet</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">343</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ecclesiastes 11:7.</i> since through the Light, they perceive good discernment. Now the manna was a product of that Higher Light which became tangible by the will of its Creator, blessed be He, and thus [according to Rabbi Akiba], both the people who ate the manna and the ministering angels were sustained by the same substance. But Rabbi Yishmael criticized him, since the existence of the ministering angels is not dependent upon something tangible evolving from the Light. Their existence is by means of the Higher Light itself.<br>It was for this reason, [i.e., the heavenly origin of the manna], that the Israelites found in the manna every flavor they desired. The rational power of the soul causes it to cleave to the higher worlds, thus finding restful life and obtaining His favor.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">344</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Proverbs 8:35.</i><br>And thus the Rabbis have said in the Mechilta:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">345</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mechilta on Verse 25: <i>Today ye shall not find it in the field</i>. This teaching is that of Rabbi Eleazar Chisma. Ramban will later refer to it by name.</i> “Today, [i.e., in this world], you will not find it, but you will find it in the World to Come.” This text [of the Mechilta] can support two explanations. We may say that among those [inheriting eternal life] in the World to Come,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">346</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban clearly uses the concept of <i>olam haba</i> (the World to Come) as referring to the life after the resurrection. It is the life to be in the far hereafter, as distinguished from the <i>olam haneshamoth</i> (the World of the Souls), which is the life in the hereafter immediately following the demise of the body. In <i>olam haba</i>, body and soul will be reunited, and the manner of how the body will sustain itself is here alluded to by Ramban. See also Note 12 in <i>Seder Va’eira</i>. An exhaustive discussion of this whole subject is found in Ramban’s Torath Ha’adam, (Kithvei Haramban, Vol. 2, pp. 283-311).</i> there will be some who have not achieved that high status of sustaining themselves steadily by the Divine Glory. Their existence will be made possible by something tangible evolving from that Glory, like the status of the generation of the wilderness who attained [the beholding of] the Divine Glory at the Red Sea, just as the Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">347</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mechilta 15:2.</i> “A maidservant saw at the sea what the prophet Ezekiel<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">348</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Reference is to Ezekiel, Chapter 1.

Rashi (above. 15:2) just has: “prophets.”</i> never saw.” From that time onward, their souls were elevated to be able to exist by the product [of the Divine Glory], which was the manna.<br>A more correct interpretation is that in the word <i>today</i> — [Verse 25: <i>‘Today’ ye shall not find it in the field</i>] — Scripture is alluding according to the words of Rabbi Eleazar Chisma,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">349</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See above, Note 345.</i> that those [inheriting eternal life in] the World to Come<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">346</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban clearly uses the concept of <i>olam haba</i> (the World to Come) as referring to the life after the resurrection.

Rather, the righteous [of the World to Come] will sit with their crowns on their heads and enjoy the Divine Glory.” [This means] that those [inheriting] the World to Come will exist by their enjoyment of the Divine Glory, which will cleave to the crowns upon their heads. “The crown” is the attribute so named by Scripture when it says, <i>In that day shall the Eternal of hosts be for a crown of Glory</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">351</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 28:5.</i> And it is with reference to it that it is said, <i>Even upon the crown wherewith his mother hath crowned him</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">352</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Song of Songs 3:11.</i> Thus [the verses] allude to the manner in which the righteous inheriting the World to Come will be sustained, the hint being to the substance of the manna.<br>Now Scripture says, <i>And He commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven; and He caused manna to rain upon them for food, and gave them of the corn of heaven.

Thus the first letter of <i>any</i> verb is called the <i>pei</i> of the verb, the second is called the <i>ayin</i>, the third is called the <i>lamed</i>. In the verb <i>chasaph</i> before us, the second root-letter is the <i>sin</i> or its interchange, the <i>samach</i>, as explained in the text.

It is similar in usage to the expression, <i>He scattered ‘k’phor’ (hoar-frost) like ashes</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">384</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 147:16.</i> Now Onkelos rendered [the Hebrew <i>dak kak’phor al ha’aretz</i>] into Aramaic thus: <i>da’adak k’gir kig’lida al ar’a</i>. On this, Rashi wrote [as an interpretation of Onkelos, that the word <i>gir</i> occurs in the expression], “<i>as stones of ‘gir,’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">385</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 27:9.

And that which Onkelos translated, <i>k’gir</i> (as powdered chalk), is an addition to the Hebrew text, there being no word corresponding to it in the verse.” [These are the words of Rashi.]<br>But all this is not correct. <i>Gir</i> [is not a kind of black color, as Rashi wrote, but instead it] is a white earth which sticks to stone, and when crushed, it is used as plaster upon walls. It is very white and is better for the plastering of walls than lime, [which does not have the admixture of that white earth]. And so it is written, <i>upon the ‘gira’ (plaster) of the wall of the king’s palace</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">388</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Daniel 5:5.</i> This is why the manna which was white and spread out upon the earth could be associated with that crushed white earth.<br>Onkelos then translated the Hebrew word <i>k’phor</i> in two ways. First, he derived it from the expression, <i>and thou shalt pitch it within and without ‘bakopher’ (with pitch)</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">389</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 5:14.</i> Hence, he said <i>k’gir</i> (as the white earth) with which [the stones] are fastened and covered. Then he derived it also from the expression, <i>He scattered ‘k’phor’ like ashes</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">384</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 147:16.</i> which is the covering of minute ice needles which form in a cold atmosphere, just as he translated [the Hebrew] <i>‘v’kerach’ (and the frost) by night,</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">390</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 31:40.</i> “<i>ug’lida</i> (and frost) came down upon me at night.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">391</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus it is not necessary to say, as Rashi did, that the Aramaic word <i>k’gir</i> in Onkelos’ translation has no corresponding word in the Hebrew text. According to Ramban, both Aramaic words, <i>k’gir</i> and <i>kig’lida</i> (“as powdered white earth” and “as frost”), are two renditions of the one Hebrew word <i>kak’phor</i>. Such was Onkelos’ style, to give two translations of one Hebrew word.</i> The word can be used in the plural [<i>g’lidin</i>],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">392</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shabbath 152 a: <i>sacharuni g’lidin</i> (ices have sorrounded me), a metaphoric expression of a person describing that the hairs of his mustache and beard have turned gray (Rashi, <i>ibid.</i>)</i> while the singular is called <i>g’lid</i> (ice), just as we have been taught in the Mishnah in Mikvaoth:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">393</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mikvaoth 7:1.</i> “These are the things which only serve to fill up the immersion-pool [to its prescribed measure of forty <i>s’ah</i>] and do not render it invalid: snow, hail, hoar-frost, <i>v’hag’lid</i> (and ice).” And so indeed does Onkelos translate many Scriptural texts in two ways. But in carefully-edited texts of Targum Onkelos, it is written, <i>da’adak d’gir</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">394</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And not <i>k’gir</i>, as we have assumed the reading in Onkelos to be until now. The reading of <i>k’gir</i> had forced Ramban to interpret that Onkelos simultaneously used two different translations of the Hebrew word <i>kak’phor</i>, namely, “as powdered white earth” and “as frost,” as explained above. This is clearly a difficult position. But with this present reading in Onkelos — <i>d’gir</i>, which means a heap — the Aramaic text leads to one unified thought: the manna was piled up in heaps as ice upon the earth.</i> <i>kig’lida al ar’a</i>, and the meaning thereof is that the manna was piled up in heaps as ice upon the earth. This is the truth, for if [the word <i>k’gir</i> in the Targum] were of the root <i>gir</i> (powdered white earth or plaster), as we assumed at first], the Aramaic translation should have been: <i>k’gira d’g'lida</i> (as the powdered flakes of the ice), [and not, as we have it, <i>k’gira ‘kig’lida</i>], for such is the style of the Aramaic language.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">395</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, since all readings in the Targum have <i>kig’lida</i> (“as” ice), and not <i>d’g'lida</i> (“of” the ice), it shows that the antecedent word is <i>d’gir</i> (a heap) and not <i>k’gir</i> (as powdered white earth). Thus the thought conveyed by the Targum is that the manna lay powdered in heaps as ice upon the ground.</i>"

Now if the manna had become wormy in a natural way, as is the way of all things that become wormy, Rashi’s statement would be correct. But since the manna became wormy in a miraculous way, it is possible that it bred worms first,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">397</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For had it given off a stench first, they would have sensed it at night, and they would have disposed of it. This was why it became wormy first, and Dathan and Abiram, who left it until the morning, contrary to Moses’ command, did not know it. In the morning it stank and it became known to all, and Moses was angry with them (Tur). The source of this reasoning is found in Shemoth Rabbah, mentioned further on in the text.</i> and there is thus no need for inverting] the verse. Moreover, the verse which states [concerning the manna which they retained for Sabbath morning], <i>and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">396</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 24.</i> proves that it was so, [i.e., that the manna left over by Dathan and Abiram bred worms first and then stank]. Had it not become wormy until it first stank, when Scripture says [concerning the manna left for the Sabbath], <i>and it did not stink</i>, it would thereby have already assured us that there was no worm therein. Why then should it repeat afterwards, <i>neither was there any worm therein?</i> If however, as the plain meaning of Scripture indicates, the manna that was left over until the morning by Dathan and Abiram became wormy first [in a supernatural way], it became necessary for Scripture to state that <i>this</i> manna [that was left over for the Sabbath] did not stink, nor did any worm come therein at all. Even things which become wormy in a natural way do not give off a stench unless they are warm and moist, but dry things only become wormy and do not give off an odor at all, just as wormy wood or fruits that become wormy when still growing or [immediately] afterwards. Thus Scripture relates that this manna [which Dathan and Abiram left over on a weekday, also stank [in the morning] by a miracle. And in Eileh Shemoth Rabbah we find that the Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">398</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shemoth Rabbah 25:14.</i> “Is there anything that first becomes wormy and then gives off a stench? It is only that the Holy One, blessed be He, wanting to expose the deeds [of Dathan and Abiram] to the people, therefore caused [the left-over manna] to give off no stench at night lest they throw it out. Instead, during the entire night, it formed rows upon rows of worms, <i>and</i> at once <i>Moses was wroth with them</i>.”"

The tradition is mentioned in Bamidbar Rabbah 20:2. This miracle was wrought for the merits of the prophetess Miriam. Ramban’s intent is thus clear: If it was all Miriam’s Well, how can you explain its different forms of activity, for in Horeb it was like a gushing stream, and in Kadesh it was like a well?</i> it is possible that on the first occasion [in Horeb] and during all their forty years’ wandering, the waters came gushing out from the rock like overflowing rivers.

When we will come to exterminate Amalek, as is mandatory upon us, we should warn the Kenites, [the descendants of Jethro], who dwelt near Amalek, and not destroy them together with Amalek. This was indeed done by Saul when he so spoke to the Kenites.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 15:6, <i>And Saul said unto the Kenites: Go, depart, get ye down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for ye showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt</i>.</i><br>Yet with all this, I find it difficult to understand this opinion [that Jethro came after the Revelation, for the following reasons]: When Scripture says, <i>Now Jethro…heard of all that G-d had done for Moses, and for Israel His people, how that the Eternal had brought Israel out of Egypt</i>, why does it not say that he heard what G-d had done to Moses and to Israel by giving the Torah, which is among the great wonders that were done for them, as He said: <i>For ask now of the days past, which were before thee, since the day that G-d created man upon the earth, and from the one end of heaven unto the other, whether there had been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it? Did ever a people hear the voice of G-d speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 4:32-33.</i> And when Scripture states, <i>And Moses told his father-in-law all that the Eternal had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, all the travail that had come upon them by the way</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 8.</i> on the basis of which Jethro said, <i>Now I know that the Eternal is greater than all gods</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 11.</i> why did not Moses tell him about the Revelation<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “‘the stand’ (<i>ma’amad</i>) at Mount Sinai,” or “the Revelation on Mount Sinai.” It is based on Deuteronomy 4:10, <i>the day that thou ‘stoodest’ before the Eternal thy G-d in Horeb</i>. The expression <i>ma’amad har sinai</i> appears in Rambam’s Mishneh Torah, Hilchoth Yesodei Hatorah 8:1.</i> on Sinai? Jethro would thereby know that the Eternal is the true G-d and that His Torah is the truth, there being no other but He, as Moses said, <i>Unto thee it was shown, that thou mightest know that the Eternal He is G-d, there is none else beside Him. Out of Heaven He made thee to hear His voice</i>, etc.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 4:35-36.</i><br>Perhaps we may say that while he was yet in his country, Jethro immediately heard that G-d had brought Israel out of Egypt, whereupon he left his country and reached Moses where he camped before Mount Sinai following the Giving of the Torah. Scripture, however, does not narrate that Moses related the matter of the Revelation<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “‘the stand’ (<i>ma’amad</i>) at Mount Sinai,” or “the Revelation on Mount Sinai.” It is based on Deuteronomy 4:10, <i>the day that thou ‘stoodest’ before the Eternal thy G-d in Horeb</i>. The expression <i>ma’amad har sinai</i> appears in Rambam’s Mishneh Torah, Hilchoth Yesodei Hatorah 8:1.</i> to him, for it had just happened and they were still at that site, and it is self-understood that he told him about it.<br>The most likely explanation seems to me to be to follow the sequence of the sections of the Torah, i.e., that Jethro came before the Giving of the Torah when the Israelites were yet in Rephidim, just as the Rabbis have said in the Mechilta:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mechilta here in Verse 1. On the word “Mechilta,” see <i>Seder Bo</i>, Note 205.</i> “Rabbi Yehoshua says, ‘[<i>Now Jethro…heard</i>. What particular event did he hear of that he came?] He heard of the war of Amalek, as mentioned in the preceding passage,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 17:8.</i> and he came.’” He then journeyed with the Israelites from Rephidim to Mount Sinai. The purport of the verse which states [that Jethro came] <i>unto the wilderness where he was encamped, at the mount of G-d</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 5. Now this verse clearly states that Jethro came to Moses, not in Rephidim, but to where he was camped before Mount Sinai. But the true meaning of the verse is that Mount Sinai, etc.</i> is that Mount Sinai was on the way from Midian, near that country. Moses went there to feed the flock of Midian,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 3:1.</i> and in connection with Aaron’s [going forth to meet Moses upon his arrival in Egypt], it is said, <i>And he met him in the mountain of G-d</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 4:27.</i> Thus Jethro left Midian with his daughter and the children and came to Mount Sinai.<br>At that time, Moses was in Rephidim, which is a locale in the wilderness of Sin. Scripture says, <i>And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 16:1.</i> thus stating that the wilderness of Sin stretches until Mount Sinai and includes the locales of Dophkah, Alush, and Rephidim.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 33:12-14. See Ramban above, 16:1, where the same explanation is expounded briefly. Here, since it affects a major problem in the background - i.e., whether Jethro’s arrival occurred before or after the Giving of the Torah — Ramban discusses his explanation at greater length.</i> Even though it says, <i>And they journeyed…from the wilderness of Sin…and encamped in Rephidim</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 17:1.</i> [which would seem to indicate that Rephidim was not in the wilderness of Sin], it nevertheless also says, <i>And they journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, and pitched in Dophkah</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 33:12.</i> [and from Dophkah they came to Alush, and from Alush to Rephidim, as stated in the following verses<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 13-14.</i> there]. Alush and Rephidim are all part of the wilderness of Sin itself,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And yet it says (above, 17:1) that they journeyed <i>from the wilderness of Sin</i> and came to Rephidim! But how could this be, for it says in the Book of Numbers that they journeyed <i>from the wilderness of Sin</i> and came to Dophkah and then to Alush and finally to Rephidim? It must be, Ramban concludes, that the name “wilderness of Sin” applies in general to an entire area, as well as to one particular locale, as explained in the text.</i> as the whole desert there was called “the wilderness of Sin,” and the place before Mount Sinai was [also] called “the wilderness of Sin.” A similar case is the verse, <i>And they returned unto the land of the Philistines</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 21:32. See Ramban there (Vol. I, p. 274) that “the sense of the verse is that they [Abimelech and Phicol] returned to their city which was in the land of the Philistines.” Here too “the wilderness of Sin” includes Dophkah, Alush, and Rephidim. Thus, the sense of the verse, <i>and they encamped in Rephidim</i> (above, 17:1), is that they encamped in Rephidim, which was in the wilderness of Sin.</i><br>Thus, the explanation of the verse here is: <i>And Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses unto the wilderness where he was encamped</i>, and he [Jethro] came to <i>the mountain of G-d</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 5.</i> It was to the mountain that he [Jethro] came, and he stopped there, this being similar in meaning to the expression, <i>and he came to the mountain of G-d</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 3:1.</i> [which means that he stopped there]. In a similar sense also is the verse, <i>Ye have sat long enough at this mountain</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 1:6.</i> [which means “you have dwelt long enough at this place”]. From Mount Sinai, Jethro sent [a message] to Moses, [who was in Rephidim], saying, <i>‘I thy father-in-law Jethro am coming unto thee,’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 6.</i> <i>and Moses went out</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 7.</i> <i>to meet</i> him. In this case, it would not be necessary for us to say, [as Ibn Ezra did], that the expression, <i>And he</i> [Jethro] <i>said to Moses: ‘I thy father-in-law Jethro am coming,’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 6.</i> means that he said so before [he arrived at the mount of G-d, as stated in the preceding verse].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">But according to Ramban’s interpretation, the verses are in chronological order. First, as stated in Verse 5, Jethro arrived at the mount of G-d, and from there, as stated in Verse 6, he sent Moses — who was in Rephidim — the message: <i>I thy father-in-law Jethro am coming to thee</i>. In order to show respect to him, Moses went out to meet him, as related in Verse 7.</i> Even if Rephidim was not in the wilderness of Sin, it was at any event in the desert, for Israel did not come to an inhabited land during all of the forty years.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 16:35.</i> Further, Rephidim was near Mount Sinai, as [is evidenced by the fact] that a great multitude of people like them came from Rephidim to the mount of G-d in one day,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I have not found any source for this statement of Ramban that the journey from Rephidim to Sinai was accomplished in one day.</i> and as has been explained in the matter of the rock from which they drank in Rephidim, as I elucidated the subject there.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 17:5.</i> Thus the explanation I have offered here is correct.<br>I have also seen this text in the Mechilta:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mechilta here on Verse 5.</i> “<i>Into the wilderness where he was encamped</i>. Scripture thus expresses surprise at him. Here is a man who dwells in the midst of the glory of the world and yet desires to go out into a desolate wilderness which has nothing to offer.” The Rabbis’ intent was to explain the phrase, <i>unto the wilderness where he was encamped</i>, as referring to [that part of] the wilderness where the mount of G-d was, for the wilderness of Sin extended from Elim<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 16:1.</i> until Mount Sinai. Thus, Scripture here relates that Jethro came to the edge of the wilderness where Moses was camped, this being the desert where the mount of G-d was, i.e., unto Horeb.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See above, 3:1.</i> Scripture mentioned this in praise of Jethro, who left his country and came to the wilderness where Moses was, because he knew that this was the mount of G-d, for on it G-d had appeared to Moses. He [Jethro] had already heard of the entire affair, i.e., that Israel went out from Egypt in order to serve G-d upon this mountain,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 12.</i> and he came <i>for the Name of the Eternal, the G-d of Israel</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Chronicles 6:7.</i> This too is correct.<br>It also appears to me concerning that which the verse states here, <i>And Moses let his father-in-law depart; and he went his way unto his own land</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 27.</i> that this took place in the first year [of the exodus] and he betook himself to his own land and returned there. It is possible that he went there to convert his family and then returned to Moses while he was yet at Mount Sinai, since it was near to Midian, as I have mentioned. When they broke camp in Iyar of the second year,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 10:11.</i> and Moses said to him, <i>We are journeying… come thou with us</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 29.</i> and he answered him, <i>I will not go; but I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 30.</i> Moses in turn pleaded with him very much and said to him, <i>Leave us not, I pray thee… and thou shalt be to us instead of eyes. And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what good soever the Eternal shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 31-32.</i> and he did not answer him at all. It would appear then that he accepted Moses’ plea and did according to his will and did not leave them. However, in the days of Saul, we find Jethro’s descendants with Amalek,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 15:6. See above, Note 13.</i> and [after they departed from the Amalekites], they came and attached themselves again to Israel. [We also find that] the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab — [i.e., descendants of Jethro] — were in Jerusalem.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah, Chapter 35.</i> Perhaps Jethro or his sons returned to their land after the death of Moses. It is possible also that the Kenite that dwelled with Amalek were of the family of Jethro but not his direct descendants, and Saul showed kindness unto the entire family on account of Jethro, just as Joshua dealt kindly with the [whole] family of Rahab<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 6:23.</i> [because of her]. The opinion of our Rabbis is thus that Jethro did go along with the Israelites [in the wilderness]. Thus they said in the Sifre<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Sifre is a Tanaaitic Midrash on the Books of Numbers and Deuteronomy. The text quoted is in <i>Beha’alothcha</i>, 81. The Sifre is to be distinguished from the Sifra, which is a work of a similar nature on the Book of Leviticus. The Sifra is also referred to as Torath Kohanim [literally: “the law of the priests”].</i> that [at the time they divided up the land], the Israelites gave him the most fertile part of Jericho, and they [Jethro’s descendants] used it until the Sanctuary was built four hundred and forty years later.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The building of the Temple was begun four hundred and eighty years after the exodus (I Kings 6:1).

In the Mechilta,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mechilta here on Verse 27.</i> we also find: “Jethro said to Moses: ‘I am going to my land to convert the people of my country, for I shall bring them under the wings of Heaven.’ I might think that he merely went back and did not return; Scripture therefore says, <i>And the children of the Kenite, Moses’ father-in-law, went up out of the city of palm-trees</i>, etc.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Judges 1:16.</i>",

In the Mechilta, the Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">81</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mechilta on the verse here.</i> “<i>On the morrow</i>. That is, on the morrow after the Day of the Atonement.” Now the intent of the Rabbis was not that <i>on the morrow</i> alludes to the Day of Atonement, for Scripture has not mentioned the Day of Atonement at all that it should now refer to it by saying <i>on the morrow</i> thereof. Nor is the term <i>on the morrow</i> to be understood literally, [i.e., the day after the Day of Atonement], for they did not eat on the Day of Atonement, that is, if they observed such a day in the first year before they were commanded concerning it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">82</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“It is impossible to say that they observed the Fast of the Atonement in that first year, since the people were not commanded therein until Moses came down from Mount Sinai for the third time, which was on the Day of Atonement itself” (Mizrachi).</i> Moreover, it was on the Day of Atonement that the second Tablets of the Law were given. On the following day, Moses came and he spoke to the children of Israel, <i>and he gave them in commandment all that the Eternal had spoken with him in Mount Sinai</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">83</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 34:32.</i> It thus could not have been a day on which he sat to judge the people, when <i>the people stood about</i> him <i>from the morning unto the evening</i>. It is also impossible to say that this was on the morrow of the Day of Atonement of the second year, for after the Israelites journeyed [from Sinai on the twentieth day of Iyar in the second year (Numbers 10:11)], Hobab [i.e., Jethro], said, <i>I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">84</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 10:30. And even according to what Ramban has written above on Verse 1, i.e., that Jethro listened to Moses’ plea to stay with Israel and he did not leave them, it is nevertheless obvious that at that time, he intended to leave them. The narrative contained in this section concerning Jethro’s advice to Moses on the delegation of power in the administration of justice, could thus logically not have taken place on the morrow after the Day of Atonement in the second year, some four and a half months after they journeyed from Mount Sinai (Kur Zahab).</i><br>Rather, the intent of this Beraitha, [i.e., the Mechilta quoted above, “on the morrow after the Day of Atonement”], is that it was some day after the Day of Atonement, since Moses had no free day on which to sit in judgment from the day they came to Mount Sinai until after the Day of Atonement of that first year.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">85</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Immediately after the Torah was given on the sixth day of Sivan, Moses ascended the mountain and remained there for forty days. When he descended on the seventeenth of Tammuz and found the people worshipping the golden calf, he broke the Tablets. On the next day, he again ascended the mountain to pray for G-d’s forgiveness, and stayed there forty days, which terminated on the twenty-ninth day of Ab. On the following day, he was told to come up to the mountain to receive the second Tablets. He again spent forty days there. Consequently, this forty-day period terminated on the tenth of Tishri, which is the Day of Atonement. Thus, from the time the Torah was given till after the Day of Atonement in the first year, Moses had no free day on which to sit in judgment, as is described in this section of the Torah.

I. e., those who disdain their own money. If they disdain their own money, how much more will they despise the money of their friends!’” The explanation [of this text of the Mechilta] is that Rabbi Yehoshua interprets the expression <i>hating ‘botza’</i> as meaning “hating bribery,” the usage of the word [<i>betza</i>] being similar to: <i>Every one is greedy for ‘botza’ (gain);</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">118</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 6:13.</i> <i>Each one ‘l’bitzo’ (to his gain), one and all</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">119</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 56:11.</i> Rabbi Eleazar of Modi’im explained that <i>hating ‘botza’</i> means that they despise abundance of money and have no desire to increase their silver and gold, something like the verse, <i>If I rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because my hand had gotten much</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">120</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 31:25.</i> Money [or profit] is called <i>betza</i> [in Hebrew]: <i>What ‘betza’ (profit) is it if we slay our brother?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">121</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 37:26.</i> <i>Is it any ‘betza’ (profit or advantage) to the Almighty that thou art righteous?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">122</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 22:3.</i> <i>And thou shalt devote ‘bitz’am (their gain) unto the Eternal, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">123</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Micah 4:13.</i><br>Again, I have seen in the Yelamdeinu:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">124</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Sifre, <i>Devarim</i> 17.

They are the ones who say, ‘Even if this man will burn my stack, even if he will destroy my plants, I will render judgment correctly.’” This is the intent of Rabbi Eleazar of Modi’im, who said that they disdain their own money, meaning that they pay no regard to their property when sitting in judgment, that is, if they will suffer a loss of money on account of it. Moses further admonished them on this, saying, <i>Ye shall not be afraid of the face of any man</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">125</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 1:17.</i> [Thus according to the Yelamdeinu], <i>betza</i> means money, as I have explained. Onkelos rendered it: “those who hate to receive money.” But the word “money,” [as Onkelos uses it], does not mean a bribe, [which of course is forbidden in itself]. It means rather that they should never accept money from people as a gift or loan, so that they should show them no favoritism at the time of judgment.

The correct interpretation is that they should sanctify themselves by separating from their wives, and from all uncleanness, for he who guards [himself] from being defiled by uncleanness is called <i>‘m’kudash’</i> (consecrated), just as it is said with reference to the priests, <i>There shall none defile himself for the dead;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">202</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 21:1.</i> <i>They shall be holy unto their G-d</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">203</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 6.</i> And it is further written, <i>because the priests had not sanctified themselves</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">204</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Chronicles 30:3.</i> that is to say, they had not purified themselves.

Hence, <i>v’kidashtam</i> must mean as Ramban explained it. The reasoning for the requirement of bathing or immersion is found here in the Mechilta: “<i>And let them wash their garments</i>. And whence do we know that immersion was also required? I reason as follows: If immersion is required in cases where washing of garments is not required (see Leviticus 15:16), is it not logical that immersion is also required in this case where washing of garments is expressly mentioned?”</i> And so did the Rabbis say in the Mechilta:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">207</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mechilta, <i>ibid.</i></i> “There is no case where washing of garments is required in the Torah without the requirement of immersion [of one’s body].”"

If you will succeed in having insight into this section [of the Torah], you will understand that His Great Name, [i.e., the Tetragrammaton], came down upon Mount Sinai, and that He abode thereon in fire and spoke to Moses. The communication to Moses in the entire section was by this Proper Name of the Eternal. However, the ascent [of Moses — as mentioned in Verse 3: <i>And Moses went up unto G-d</i>] — and his bringing forth [the people out of the camp — as mentioned in Verse 17] — were towards the place of the Glory, as I have explained.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">229</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 3, also in Verse 19.</i> And He warned, <i>lest they break through unto the Eternal to gaze</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">230</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 21.</i> because even <i>the nobles of the children of Israel</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">231</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 24:11.</i> did not see Him, and all Israel heard the Voice of G-d <i>out of the midst of the fire</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">232</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 5:21.</i> It is this which Scripture says, <i>And ‘Elokim’ (G-d) spoke all these words</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">233</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 20:1.</i> just as our Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">234</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mechilta, <i>ibid.</i></i> “<i>Elokim</i> designates the Judge.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">235</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“The Judge who is just in meting out punishment and faithful in giving reward” (Mechilta, <i>ibid.</i>)</i> And they have also said [with reference to the first two commandments]:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">236</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Makkoth 24a.

This would indicate that they heard <i>Elokim chayim</i> speaking (Abusaula).</i> They did not say “that they heard G-d speaking out of the midst of the fire,” but they said <i>the Voice of G-d</i>, referring to what they perceived. This is why they said, <i>Go thou near, and hear all that the Eternal our G-d may say</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">241</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 24.</i> And so did Moses say to them, <i>Did ever a people hear the Voice of G-d speaking out of the midst of the fire?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">242</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 4:33.</i> The word “speaking” here is referring to “the Voice,” something like the verse, <i>and he heard the Voice speaking unto him</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">243</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 7:89.</i><br>From this you will understand what the Rabbis have always said in Midrashic homilies, i.e., that the Torah was given in seven voices.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">244</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shemoth Rabbah 28:4, “Rabbi Yochanan said: ‘The One Voice was divided into seven voices.’”</i> They are the ones to which David alluded in the psalm: <i>Ascribe unto the Eternal, O ye sons of might</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">245</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 29:1. This psalm was considered by the Sages of the Talmud as referring to the Giving of the Torah (Sifre, <i>V’zoth Habrachah</i>, 343). The voice of the Eternal appears seven times in this psalm: <i>The voice of the Eternal is upon the waters</i> (Verse 3); <i>The voice of the Eternal is powerful; the voice of the Eternal is full of majesty</i> (Verse 4); <i>The voice of the Eternal breaketh the cedars</i> (Verse 5); <i>The voice of the Eternal heweth out flames of fire</i> (Verse 7); <i>The voice of the Eternal shaketh the wilderness</i> (Verse 8); <i>The voice of the Eternal maketh the hinds to calve</i> (Verse 9).</i> This is also the number of times [that the Voice] is alluded to in this section of the Torah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">246</sup><i class=\"footnote\">1.

Here too the Hebrew <i>hakoloth</i> is written defectively and therefore refers only to one voice: “and all the people perceived the voice.” 6. <i>And the voice of the horn (ibid.)</i> 7. <i>And G-d spoke</i> (20:1). Thus there are seven voices mentioned in this section of the Torah (Abusaula).</i> The verse, <i>And there were ‘koloth’ and lightnings</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">247</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Note 246, number 1.</i> is written defectively and therefore counted as one; likewise, the verse, <i>And all the people perceived ‘hakoloth,’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">248</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, number 5.</i> is missing the <i>vav</i> which signifies the plural, [and thus refers to only one voice].

This can be illustrated by a parable: A king invaded a country, and his attendants said to him, ‘Issue decrees to us.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">271</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Us.” In the Mechilta: “them,” i.e., the people.</i> He, however, refused, saying: ‘No! When you have accepted my sovereignty, I will issue decrees to you, for if you do not accept my sovereignty, how will you carry out my decrees?’ Similarly, G-d said to Israel: ‘<i>I am the Eternal thy G-d, thou shalt have no other gods</i>. I am He Whose sovereignty you have accepted in Egypt.’ And when they said to Him: ‘Yes,’ [He continued]: ‘Now, just as you have accepted My sovereignty, so you must also accept My decrees.’” That is to say, “Since you have accepted upon yourselves and have admitted that I am the Eternal, and that I am your G-d from the [time that you were yet in the] land of Egypt, then accept all My commandments.”<br>Now all the [Ten] Commandments are expressed in the singular — <i>the Eternal thy G-d, Who brought ‘thee’ out</i> — and not, as He began to say, [before the Giving of the Torah]: <i>‘Ye’ have seen;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">272</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 19:4.</i> <i>if ‘ye’ will hearken</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">273</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 5.</i> This is because His intent is to warn that each individual is subject to punishment for [transgression of] the commandments, since He addresses Himself to each one individually, commanding him that he should not think that He will judge according to the majority and that the individual will be saved with them.

[The violation thereof] does not make one liable to the death-penalty by the court. So [the question arises]: Why did He state the prohibition against keeping an idol, which makes one liable to whipping, before [He stated] the prohibition against bowing down to idols or worshipping them,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">278</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Verse 5.</i> which makes one liable to extinction [if done intentionally but with no witnesses present], or death by the court [if there were witnesses]?<br>In my opinion, the final decision of the Law is not in accordance with this Beraitha,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">276</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Seder Bo</i>, Note 209.</i> for it represents the opinion of a single Sage [against the opinion of the majority]. Thus we find it taught in the Sifra:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">279</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifra, beginning of <i>Seder Kedoshim</i> (Leviticus, Chapter 19).

Scripture therefore says, <i>Nor make ye</i>: not for you by others, and not by you for others. It is from here that the Rabbis have derived the principle that he who makes an idol for himself, transgresses two negative commandments: <i>Nor make ye</i>, and <i>Nor… to yourselves</i>. Rabbi Yosei says, ‘He transgresses three negative commandments: <i>Nor make ye, Nor… to yourselves</i>, and also <i>Thou shalt have no other gods</i>.’” Thus you see that Rabbi Yosei’s opinion is that of one against a majority, for it is he who says that the verse <i>Thou shalt have no other gods</i> constitutes a prohibition against retaining an idol [in one’s house]. However, according to the opinion of the first Sage, [which is that of the majority of the Rabbis], it is not so.<br>The correct interpretation even according to the literal meaning of Scripture is that the usage of the language of the verse here is similar to the expressions: <i>and the Eternal shall be my G-d;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">281</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 28:21.</i> <i>to be your G-d</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">282</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 11:45.</i> The verse here thus states that excepting the Eternal only, we are not to have others as gods, neither from all the angels above nor from all the host of heaven who are called <i>elohim</i>. This is something like that which is said, <i>he that sacrificeth ‘la’elohim’ (unto the gods) save unto the Eternal only, shall be utterly destroyed</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">283</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 22:19.</i> It is thus a prohibition against believing in any of these beings, accepting them as gods, or saying to them, “thou art my god.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">284</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Psalms 140:7 and Sanhedrin 60b.</i> This is also the opinion of Onkelos, who translated: “[thou shalt have no] other gods excepting Me.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">285</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban’s intent is evidently as follows: Since Onkelos always translated <i>elohim acheirim</i> as <i>ta’avath am’maya</i> (the deceptions of the nations) — see e.g., further, 23:13 — and here he translated, <i>ela acharan</i> (other gods), it shows that he referred to the angels of above, etc.</i><br>Know that wherever Scripture says <i>elohim acheirim</i>, the meaning is “others besides the Glorious Name.” It uses this expression with reference to accepting G-d or worshipping Him, thus saying: “Do not accept them upon yourselves as G-d, with the exception only of the Eternal.” But when Scripture speaks of making idols, it will never say <i>acheirim</i> (others) — [“other gods”] — Heaven forbid!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">286</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“When speaking of accepting or worshipping G-d, Scripture could say, ‘Do not accept or worship any other god besides the Eternal.’ But when Scripture warns against making an idol, how could it say [that we are] not to make ‘other gods’ when it is G-d Who has made everything and Who was not made!” (Tur.)</i> Instead it says, <i>Nor make to yourselves molten gods;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">280</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 19:4.</i> <i>Molten gods do not make unto thee</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">287</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 34:17.</i> They are called [gods] because they were made with the intent of serving their makers as gods, but in reference to them, Scripture says, <i>For they were no gods, but the works of men’s hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">288</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 37:19.</i><br>Thus in the second commandment, He admonished us firstly that we should not accept upon ourselves a master from among all gods excepting the Eternal. He then said that we should not make a graven image or any manner of likeness, [and we are not] to bow down to them or worship them in any manner whatsoever. It is for this reason that He said, <i>Thou shalt not bow down unto them</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">289</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 5. The intent of Ramban’s words is as follows: According to his own interpretation that this entire second commandment is directed against worshipping idols, we can understand why it says here in Verse 5, <i>Thou shalt not bow down ‘to them’</i> and it does not say ‘other gods,’ because the purport of that verse is to be understood in connection with the preceding verse: “do not make a graven image, etc., to bow down ‘unto them.’” But according to Rashi, who interpreted <i>Thou shalt have no other gods</i> (Verse 3) as being a prohibition against keeping an idol, and <i>Thou shalt not make unto thee</i>, etc., (Verse 4) as being a prohibition against making idols, Verse 5 should have said, “Thou shalt not bow down ‘to other gods,’” since the subject of worshipping the idols as gods is here mentioned for the first time.</i> since it is connected with the making [of idols — mentioned in the preceding verse] — which He prohibited the people from bowing down to them. Thus all [of the first three verses in this second commandment] constitute prohibitions against worshipping idols, and their violations all entail death by the court. This verse, [i.e., <i>Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image</i>, etc. (Verse 4)], is thus not a prohibition against making idols which one does not worship oneself, [as Rashi would have it]. Further on [in Verse 20], He indeed warns against this, as it is said, <i>gods of silver, or gods of gold, ye shall not make unto thee</i>. Similarly, <i>Thou shalt not make unto thee molten gods</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">287</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 34:17.</i> <i>Ye shall not make unto thee idols</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">290</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 26:1.</i>",

Thus: <i>So the present passed over ‘al panav’ (before him)</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">293</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 32:22.</i> So also: <i>And Nadab and Abihu died… and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest’s office ‘al p’nei’ (in the presence of) Aaron their father</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">294</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 3:4.</i> meaning that Aaron their father saw it and was aware thereof. In the Book of Chronicles it is written: <i>And Nadab and Abihu died ‘liphnei’ (before) their father, and had no children</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">295</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Chronicles 24:2. Since in the above verse (Numbers 3:4), it says that Nadab and Abihu died <i>before the Eternal</i>, Ramban therefore also quotes the verse from Chronicles, where it is stated that they died before their father. Hence the significance of the statement that he saw the remaining two sons performing the Divine Service in his presence.</i> Thus the purport of the verse here is: “Do not make other gods unto yourselves, for I am present with you always and see you in private and in public.”<br>By way of the Truth, [the mystic lore of the Cabala], you will understand the secret of <i>panim</i> (face) from that which we have written<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">296</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 19:20.</i> that Scripture warned concerning the Revelation:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">297</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See above, Note 17.</i> <i>‘Panim b’phanim’ (face to face) did the Eternal speak with you</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">298</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 5:4.</i> And you will know the secret of the word <i>acheirim</i> (others), and then the entire verse will come [to light] in its plain meaning and purport. And so did Onkelos say it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">299</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Onkelos translated <i>al panai</i> as <i>bar mini</i> (outside of Me). Thus the sense of the verse is as follows: “Do not worship <i>elohim acheirim</i>, since they were all created, excepting G-d, Who is eternal and has not been created by any being.” See also Note 285 above.</i> It is this which is said, <i>Ye shall not make with Me</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">300</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 20.

Now these are referred to in the Torah and in all the Writings as <i>other gods, the gods of the peoples</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">316</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 6:14.</i> for angels are called <i>elohim</i>, as it is said, <i>He is G-d of gods;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">317</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 10:17.</i> <i>Bow down to Him, all ye gods;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">318</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 97:7.</i> <i>For the Eternal is greater than all gods</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">319</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 18:11.</i> They worshipped the angels even though they admitted that supreme strength and infinite power belonged only to G-d the Most High. Thus did the Rabbis say,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">320</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Menachoth 110a.</i> [with reference to the peoples of the world], that they call G-d the Most High “G-d of gods.” Regarding this kind of idol-worship, Scripture has said, <i>He that sacrificeth ‘la’elohim’ (to the gods) shall be utterly destroyed</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">321</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 22:19.</i> It thus mentioned them by the name with which they were known.<br>The second kind of idolatry appeared when people began worshipping the visible hosts of heaven, some worshipping the sun or the moon, and others worshipping one of the constellations. Each of the nations knew the power of the constellation according to the dominion thereof in their land,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">322</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Job 38:33.</i> and they thought that by worshipping them, the constellation would be strengthened and it would help them, something like it is written, <i>or the sun, or the moon, or any of the host of heaven</i>, etc.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">323</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 17:3.</i> And it is further written, <i>And they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have sought, and to whom they have bowed</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">324</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 8:2.</i> and as it is said in the Torah with reference to the prohibition of idolatry: <i>And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the host of heaven, thou be drawn away and worship them and serve them, which the Eternal thy G-d hath allotted unto all the peoples under the whole heaven</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">312</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Deuteronomy 4:19.</i> That is to say, because G-d allotted them to all the peoples and gave each people a star or constellation, you should not let yourself be allured to worshipping them.

In describing the beginnings of this second stage of idolatry, Rambam introduces it with this statement: “In the course of time, there arose among men false prophets who said that G-d commanded them, saying ‘Worship that particular star’” (Mishneh Torah, Hilchoth Akum 1:2). Ramban here is more specific and suggests that the beginnings of this kind of idolatry took place in the age of the dispersion of the nations. This would seem to be the intent of Ramban’s words, “It appears likely to me…”</i> when G-d scattered the nations to various countries and the stars and the constellations began holding sway over them according to their divisions. The builders of the Tower had declared their intention to make themselves a name<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">327</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 11:4.</i> and not be scattered, as I have hinted in its place.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">326</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ramban, Genesis 11:2 (Vol. I, pp. 154-155).

The constellations also have lords who abide in the atmosphere as the angels do in the heavens, and know the things that are to come.<br>Closely related to this kind of idolatry was the worship of human beings. When people of a country saw that a certain individual — such as Nebuchadnezzar — had great power and that his star was very much in the ascendancy, they thought that by accepting his worship upon themselves and directing their thought towards him, their star would also ascend together with his. He would also think that by their attaching their thoughts to him, his success would be augmented on account of the power of their souls directed towards him. This was the opinion of Pharaoh, who, according to the words of our Rabbis, [looked upon himself as a god],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">328</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shemoth Rabbah 9:7.</i> and of Sennacherib, concerning whose ideas Scripture says, <i>I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">329</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 14:14. It is to be noted though that this prophecy was said with reference to the king of Babylon (<i>ibid.</i>, Verses 4, and 22).

See however, in Sefer Hage’ulah (Kithvei Haramban I, p. 274) where Ramban writes that Scripture sometimes “interchanges from the name of the king of Babylon to the king of Assyria” and he quotes various verses to prove it.

                    "POKEID’ (VISITING) THE INIQUITY OF THE FATHERS UPON THE CHILDREN UNTO THE THIRD AND FOURTH GENERATION OF THEM THAT HATE ME. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra said that the meaning of the term <i>p’kidah</i> is similar to that of <i>z’chirah</i> (remembrance), just as in the verse, <i>And the Eternal ‘pakad’ Sarah</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">345</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 21:1.</i> which is like: “and the Eternal remembered her.” The purport [of the verse here, according to Ibn Ezra], is that G-d will postpone [punishment] of the wicked person because perhaps he will repent and beget a righteous son. But if the son walks in his father’s ways, as also the third and fourth generations, their memories will be destroyed, for G-d will ‘remember’ [to visit punishment upon them for] what the parents have done, and He will no longer postpone their punishment. All the commentators have similarly interpreted [the above Scriptural expression]. But if this be so, the sins of the fathers will not be visited upon their children nor upon the third generation, but only on the fourth. It would have been proper then for Scripture to say that He will visit the iniquity of the fathers and their sons and of the third generation upon the fourth generation! Perhaps these commentators will say that the sense of the verse is that He remembers the iniquity of the fathers upon their sons, saying [to them], “You and your fathers have sinned.” He does thus with the third and fourth generations, and then takes vengeance upon them, and never again does He visit it upon them, for He destroys them all in their iniquity.<br>But their explanation is not correct. Scripture mentions G-d’s remembrance of all of them equally, and it does not specify that the vengeance is exacted [only] in the end, i.e., on the fourth generation. Besides, the term <i>p’kidah</i> in conjunction with the word <i>al</i> — [as it occurs here: <i>‘pokeid’ avon avoth ‘al’ banim</i>] — is not used in connection with remembrance, but rather signifies vengeance [or punishment]. Thus: <i>And on the day ‘pokdi upakad’ti’ (that I do punish, I will punish) them for their sin;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">346</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 32:34.</i> <i>In that day ‘yiphkod hashem’ (the Eternal will punish) with his sore and great and strong sword leviathan the slant serpent, and leviathan the tortuous serpent, and He will slay the dragon that is in the sea;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">347</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 27:1.</i> <i>‘yiphkod hashem’ (the Eternal will punish) the host of the high heaven on high</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">348</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 24:21.</i> All of these are expression of vengeance and punishment.<br>The correct interpretation thus appears to me to be that Scripture is stating that He visits the iniquity, which the father perpetrated, upon his children, and excises them on account of the iniquity of their father, something like it is said, <i>Prepare ye slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">349</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 14:21.</i> Similarly, He visits it upon the third generation if the sin of the two generations is not yet full, something like [it is said], <i>for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">350</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 15:16.</i> Sometimes He visits the iniquity of all three generations upon the fourth one when their measure [of iniquity] is filled and then he excises them. But in the fifth generation, no one is punished for the iniquity of his ancestor in the first generation. Now in the Book of Deuteronomy, [where the Ten Commandments are restated], He added a <i>vav</i> [to the expression <i>‘al shileishim’ (unto the third generation)</i>, thus making it] <i>‘v’al’ shileishim v’al ribei’im l’sonai</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">351</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 5:9.</i> But the meaning of the <i>vav</i> [there is not the usual “and”] but “or” — [” ‘or’ unto the third generation ‘or’ unto the fourth generation of them that hate me” — as explained above].<br>Now Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote that children’s children are called “children.” This is why He used the briefer term.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">352</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ibn Ezra tried to answer this question: Since Scripture uses the terms <i>shileishim</i> and <i>ribei’im</i> to signify the third and fourth generations, why does it not say <i>shni’im</i> for the second generation instead of using the term <i>banim</i> (children)? For this reason, Ibn Ezra interpreted <i>banim</i> as meaning “children and children’s children,” for they are both called <i>banim</i>. Hence, Scripture could not use the term <i>shni’im</i>, for that would have meant only the second generation after the sinner, who is the first generation. However, in fact the second <i>and</i> third generations also need to be included here. For this reason, Scripture used <i>banim</i>, which includes the children’s children as well, i.e., the third generation after the sinner. Accordingly, in Ibn Ezra’s opinion, <i>shileishim</i> will mean the children of the third generation, who are the fourth generation after the sinner, and <i>ribei’im</i> will mean the children of the fourth generation, who constitute the fifth generation. Ramban will differ with this entire interpretation.</i> You can understand this from the terms <i>shileishim</i> (the third generation) and <i>ribei’im</i> (the fourth generation).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">353</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ibn Ezra’s intent is that when you consider the words <i>shileishim</i> and <i>ribei’im</i>, this question will occur: Why does Scripture not use the term <i>shni’im</i> instead of <i>banim?</i> You must then conclude as explained in the preceding note.</i> But this is not so. <i>Shileishim</i> means the third generation in that sin. [Hence, it includes only the father, his children, and his children’s children.] Likewise, <i>ribei’im</i> means the fourth generation in that sin, totalling four sinners. And the verse stated in connection with the thirteen attributes of G-d, <i>visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children’s children, unto the third generation and unto the fourth generation</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">354</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 34:7.</i> is to be explained<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">355</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew text possibly lends itself to this translation: “He — [i.e., G-d, Who is proclaiming these thirteen attributes] — is explaining that <i>al b’nei banim</i> (upon the children’s children) is the <i>shileishim</i> (the third generation) and <i>ribei’im</i> (the fourth generation).” In other words, <i>al b’nei banim</i> is in apposition to <i>al shileishim v’al ribei’im</i>.</i> as “the children’s children, <i>who are</i> the third and fourth generations.” It is for this reason that Moses, [when invoking the thirteen attributes] in the case of the spies, turned back [to this specific attribute as expressed here in the Ten Commandments] and said, <i>visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">356</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 14:18.</i> He did not mention “children’s children,” for it is all one, [i.e., “children’s children” is the same as <i>shileishim</i>].<br>Now Scripture states [that this attribute of punishment applies only to] <i>those that hate Me</i>. That is, if the children hate G-d. If the sinner begot a righteous son, he does not bear the iniquity of the father, as [the prophet] Ezekiel has explained.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">357</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 18:20.</i><br>From the words of our Rabbis,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">358</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tosephta Sotah 4:1.</i> there appears a proof to the explanation I have presented above, [i.e., that <i>‘pokeid’ the sins of the fathers</i>, etc., is to be understood in the sense of “visiting” or “punishing”]. From here, they have derived the principle that the [Divine] measure of good is greater than the measure of punishment, for the measure of punishment is for four generations [while that of reward is for thousands]. But if it were as the first explanation has it, [namely, that of Ibn Ezra, that <i>pokeid</i> means “remembers,” thus signifying that He postpones the punishment of the sinner until the fourth generation in the hope that perhaps he will beget a righteous son], then “the measure of good” would have been greater if He postponed punishment even to the tenth generation!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">359</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to Ibn Ezra, the phrase in question represents a measure of G-d’s mercy. He does not punish the sinner immediately but “remembers” it until the third and fourth generations because perhaps he will repent and beget a righteous son. But, asks Ramban, if that were the interpretation, “the measure of Divine good” would be increased if such “punishment” were withheld even to the tenth generation! Why then did the Rabbis in the above-mentioned text speak of the Divine measure of good being manifested in punishment only to four generations when that Divine manifestation would apply even if it were extended to the tenth generation? But according to Ramban, who asserts that this verse represents a measure of G-d’s <i>judgment</i> — for <i>pokeid</i> means “punishing,” and the verse declares that the effects of the punishment are felt up to and including the fourth generation — that question cannot be asked. If punishment were extended to the tenth generation, it would no longer represent “a measure of good.” On the contrary, it would be a harsher judgment.</i><br>It is possible that this strict measure [of punishment that is imposed on a sinner and which is felt up to the fourth generation] applies only to idolatry, for it is with regard to this prohibition that He is warning here. However, in the rest of the commandments, [the rule applies that] <i>every one shall die of his iniquity</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">360</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 31:30.</i> You will find the hidden secret of <i>visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children</i> in the Book of Ecclesiastes.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">361</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The allusion is to the verse, <i>One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh</i> (Ecclesiastes 1:4), upon which the Sefer Habahir commented: “that hath come already.” This means that the generation that passes away had come into the sins of the father “that had come already” in a previous generation, and the sins of the father are now visited upon the son, etc. (Ma’or V’shamesh). The mystic doctrine of the transmigration of souls is thus alluded to here.</i> I have already written concerning it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">362</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 38:8 (Vol. I, pp. 469-470).</i>"

He is thus saying that to those that love Him, He will show mercy to their thousandth generation.

They are called “the lovers [of G-d],” for this is the kind of love that we have been obligated to observe even at the sacrifice of life, just as He has said, <i>And thou shalt love the Eternal thy G-d with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">363</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 6:5.</i> meaning that you should give your very life because of your love of Him, that you should not alter Him for another god, nor join Him together with a strange god.

This refers to Abraham and those like him. <i>And those that keep My commandments</i>. This refers to the prophets and the elders. Rabbi Nathan says that the verse, <i>of them that love Me and keep My commandments</i>, refers to those who dwell in the Land of Israel and give their lives for the commandments.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">369</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reference is obviously to the persecutions by the Roman emperor Hadrian (117-138 Common Era), when the Jews in the Land of Israel were forbidden the practice of Judaism, including the study of Torah. Their determination to remain in the Land of Israel and practice their faith instead of emigrating to more peaceful lands such as Babylon, was at those times constituted as a special manifestation of their love of G-d.</i> ‘Why are you being led out to be executed?’ ‘Because I have circumcised my son.’ ‘Why are you being led out to be burned?’ ‘Because I read the Torah.’ ‘Why are you being led out to be hanged?’ ‘Because I ate the unleavened bread.’ ‘Why are you being lashed with the whip?’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">370</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In our Mechilta: “Why are you whipped with a hundred lashes?”</i> ‘Because I took the <i>lulav</i>.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">371</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“The Palm-branch.” See Leviticus 23:40.</i> And it says, <i>Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">372</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zechariah 13:6.</i> These are the wounds which have caused me to become beloved of My Father in heaven.” Thus Rabbi Nathan explained that the love [of G-d, which is referred to in the verse before us], meant the sacrifice of life for the sake of the commandments. Now the verse here certainly refers to idolatry, for it is with reference to it that we are obligated at all times forever to suffer death rather than transgress [the law].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">373</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 74a.

                    "LO THISA’ (THOU SHALT NOT TAKE) THE NAME OF THE ETERNAL THY G-D IN VAIN. This verse has already been explained in the words of our Rabbis.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">377</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shebuoth 21a. Maimonides’ “The Commandments,” Vol. II, commandment 62, pp. 60-61.</i> He prohibits [here] swearing by the Glorious Name in vain, such as swearing that which is contrary to facts known to man, or swearing to [the truth of] a self-evident fact. For example: if one swears that a pillar of marble is of gold, or that it is of marble, and the pillar is right before them and they recognize it as such [that it is of marble].<br>By way of the plain meaning of Scripture, the verse also prohibits the taking of the Glorious Name in vain upon one’s lips [even without an oath], the usage of the term [<i>lo thisa</i>] being similar to these expressions: <i>‘Lo thisa’ (Thou shalt not utter) a false report;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">378</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 23:1.</i> <i>Nor ‘esa’ (do I take) their names upon my lips</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">379</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 16:4.</i> Speaking is called <i>thisa</i>, [which literally means “lifting”], because the speaker thereby lifts up his voice.

And in truth, this — [i.e., just taking G-d’s Name in vain even without an oath] — is also forbidden, and in the language of the Sages,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">382</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Temurah 3b.</i> it is called “pronouncing the Name of Heaven to no purpose.” Thus our Rabbis have already said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">383</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifra, <i>Vayikra</i> 2.</i> “Whence do we know that [in dedicating a beast for a sacrifice] a man should not say, ‘Unto the Eternal this is a whole-offering,’ or ‘Unto the Eternal this is a sin-offering,’ but instead he should say, ‘This is a whole-offering unto the Eternal,’ ‘This is a sin-offering unto the Eternal’?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">384</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reason for the prohibition is that if he mentions the Name of G-d first and he immediately changes his mind about bringing the beast as an offering, he will have taken the Name of Heaven for no purpose (Nedarim 10 b, Rashi).</i> Scripture therefore says, <i>an offering unto the Eternal</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">385</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 1:2.

He who takes it in vain profanes it, similar to that which is written, <i>And ye shall not swear by My Name falsely, so that thou profane not the Name of thy G-d</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">388</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 19:12.</i> Just as He was stringent in the case of idolatry and wrote the punishment [for transgression], i.e., that He is <i>a jealous G-d, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">389</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 5.</i> so did He record here the punishment <i>that He will not hold him guiltless</i>. He used this expression instead of saying that He will visit his sin upon him, [as He did in the case of idolatry], because people who swear [in vain] do not consider it a real sin, and they think it is proper that He forgive them. Therefore He said that <i>whosoever toucheth</i> that <i>shall not go unpunished</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">390</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 6:29.</i> Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra has written appropriately on this verse.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">391</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The purport of Ibn Ezra’s explanation is as follows: When one swears by the Name of G-d, his intent is to imply that just as G-d is true, so is his word true. When he fails to fulfill it, it is thus tantamount to denying Him. The same reasoning applies to an oath taken in vain.</i><br>Now the language of this verse, <i>the Name of the Eternal thy G-d</i>, implies that it is as if Moses was speaking, and so also in the case of all the following commandments, whereas in the first two verses<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">392</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“First two verses.” When the Ten Commandments are read in public, all the five verses contained in the first and second commandments are read as if they were one verse. Ramban’s language must then be understood as: “the first two commandments.”</i> G-d is speaking: <i>I; Who brought thee out; before Me; For I; Of them that love Me and keep My commandments</i>. It is for this reason that our Rabbis of blessed memory have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">393</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Makkoth 24a.</i> “We heard the two commandments — <i>I am the Eternal thy G-d</i> and <i>Thou shalt have no other gods</i> — from the Almighty Himself,” for they are the root of everything. But Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra asked [concerning this tradition of the Rabbis] that Scripture says, <i>And G-d spoke all these words</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">394</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 1.</i> and still more clearly it is written [following the Ten Commandments], <i>These words the Eternal spoke unto all your assembly</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">395</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 5:19.</i> and again it is written there, <i>And He wrote them down upon two Tablets of stone</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">396</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 4:13.</i> meaning that as He said the Ten Commandments <i>to all your assembly</i>, so He wrote them down upon the Tablets!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">397</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to Ibn Ezra, all these verses apparently stand in contradiction to that which the Rabbis have said, i.e., that we heard only the first two commandments from the Almighty Himself. Ramban proceeds to remove the difficulty.</i><br>I will explain to you the tradition of our Rabbis [that we heard the first two commandments from the Almighty Himself]. Surely all Israel heard the entire Ten Commandments from the mouth of G-d, as the literal meaning of Scripture indicates. But in the first two commandments, they heard the utterance of speech and understood their words even as Moses understood them. Therefore He spoke to them directly [in the first person], just as a master speaks to his servant, as I have mentioned. From then on, in the rest of the commandments, they heard a voice of speech but they did not understand it, and it became necessary for Moses to explain to them each and every commandment until they understood it from Moses. And so [the Rabbis] explained:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">398</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Guide of the Perplexed, II, 33: “<i>Moses spoke, and G-d answered by a voice</i>. In explanation thereof, the Sages said in the Mechilta that Moses brought to them every commandment as he heard it.” I have not been able to identify the exact quotation in the Mechilta.</i> <i>Moses spoke, and G-d answered him by a voice</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">399</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 19:19.</i> Therefore [the rest of the Ten Commandments] were addressed by G-d to Moses so that he should tell them thus. The reason [that the first two commandments were spoken to the people directly by G-d] was so that they should all be prophets in the belief of G-d, [His existence, and His Unity], and in the prohibition of idolatry, as I have explained.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">400</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 19:9.</i> Those are the root of the whole Torah and the commandments, just as He said, <i>Assemble Me the people, and I will make them hear My words, that they may learn to fear Me all the days</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">401</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 4:10.</i> But in the rest of the Ten Commandments, they received their explanation from the mouth of Moses after having heard <i>a voice of words</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">402</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 12.</i> while in all other commandments [of the whole Torah], they believed in Moses completely."

                    "REMEMBER THE SABBATH DAY, TO KEEP IT HOLY.

See Ramban above, Verse 2.</i> — and [after commanding] that we should direct both our faith in all these matters and all honor towards Him alone,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">404</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This was the theme of the second commandment.</i> and He further commanded that the remembrance of His Name be done in a manner of respect,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">405</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As opposed to taking His Name in vain, as was stated in the third commandment.</i> He now commanded that we make in this matter a sign and perpetual remembrance to let it be known that He created everything. This is in the commandment of the Sabbath, which is a remembrance of the creation.<br>Now He said here, <i>‘Remember’ the Sabbath-day, to keep it holy;</i> and in the Book of Deuteronomy it is written, <i>‘Observe’ the Sabbath-day, to keep it holy</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">406</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 5:12.</i> Our Rabbis have said with respect to these verses:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">407</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mechilta on the verse here. Also Shebuoth 20b.</i> “<i>Remember</i> and <i>Observe</i> were both spoken with one utterance.” Now the Rabbis were not so particular as to comment on the other changes of language [between the Ten Commandments written here and those in the Book of Deuteronomy. They commented only on the above-mentioned change] because their intent is to point out that <i>zachor</i> (remember) constitutes a positive commandment, i.e., that He commanded that we remember the Sabbath-day to keep it holy and that we do not forget it, [as will be explained further on]. [They considered] <i>shamor</i> (observe), on the other hand, as a negative commandment, just as they have said,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">408</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Erubin 96 a, etc.</i> “Wherever Scripture says <i>take heed (‘hishamer’)</i>, or <i>lest (‘pen’)</i>, or <i>do not (‘al’)</i>, there is a negative commandment.” It warns us that we should watch it [i.e., the Sabbath] to keep it holy and that we should not profane it, [thus clearly implying both a positive commandment and a negative one with respect to the Sabbath]. It would not have been proper for Moses to change G-d’s words from a positive commandment to a negative commandment. [Therefore the Rabbis were careful to point out that both <i>remember</i> and <i>observe</i> were spoken by G-d in one utterance.] However, the change in the second commandment from <i>‘and’ any manner of likeness</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">409</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 4.</i> <i>to any manner of likeness</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">410</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 5:8.</i> omitting the <i>vav</i> (and), and then adding it [to the expression <i>al shileishim (unto the third generation)</i>, which is found here in Verse 5, rendering it there in Deuteronomy], <i>v’al shileishim (‘and’ unto the third generation)</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">411</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 9.</i> and all such similar changes in the rest of the Ten Commandments, do not matter, for it is all one. This explanation [of why the Rabbis were particular to comment only on the change from <i>remember</i> to <i>observe</i>] will not be entertained by one who is not used to the ways of the Talmud.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">412</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See my Hebrew commentary, p. 398, that this is a veiled criticism of Ibn Ezra, who, in his commentary on Verse 1, continued to raise difficulties on this saying of the Sages and finally concluded that “reason does not bear out all these words.” To this came the retort of Ramban: “this explanation, etc.” In a Ramban manuscript, I found this remark expressed in a positive manner: “This explanation will be entertained by him who is used to the ways of the Talmud.” Thus Ramban avoids casting a direct aspersion on Ibn Ezra’s knowledge of the ways of the Talmud.</i> And the Rabbis have expressly said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">413</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Berachoth 20b.</i> “Women are obligated by law of the Torah to proclaim the sanctity of the Sabbath,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">414</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The proclaiming of the sanctity of the Sabbath is one of the six hundred thirteen commandments of the Torah. See “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 164-165.</i> because it is said, <i>remember</i> and <i>observe</i>, thus equating them so that all those who are obligated to <i>observe</i> the Sabbath are obligated also to <i>remember</i> it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">415</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The general rule is: “The observance of all <i>positive</i> commandments that depend on time is incumbent on men but not on women, but the observance of all the <i>negative</i> commandments, whether they depend on time or not, is incumbent both on men and women” (Kiddushin 29 a). Now proclaiming the sanctity of the Sabbath is naturally dependent on time — i.e., the arrival of the Sabbath — and one would therefore say that women are not obligated to observe that commandment. But <i>‘shamor’ (observe) the Sabbath-day to keep it holy</i>, as was explained in the text, constitutes a negative commandment, and therefore applies to women as well. Now since the Torah equated <i>zachor</i> (remember) with <i>shamor</i> (observe), it follows that women are also obligated in the positive commandment of proclaiming the sanctity of the Sabbath.</i> And since women are obligated in the observance [of the Sabbath] — for women are obligated in the observance thereof, since the observance of all negative commandments is incumbent on women, [and <i>shamor</i> (observe) the Sabbath, as was mentioned above, constitutes a negative commandment] — they are obligated also to <i>remember</i> the Sabbath. Now women would not have been bound to remember the Sabbath — for it is a positive commandment that is dependent on time and is [therefore] not incumbent on women — were it not for this analogy [of <i>remember</i> and <i>observe</i>, i.e., that all who are obligated to observe are bound to <i>remember</i>], which does make it incumbent on them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">416</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban thus brought proof to his original point that the reason the Rabbis were particular about this change from <i>remember</i> to <i>observe</i> and not about the other changes in the Decalogues, is that here, the change represents a reclassification from a positive to a negative commandment. Hence it became necessary for them to point out that both words were spoken with one Divine utterance.</i><br>But I wonder! If <i>remember</i> and <i>observe</i> were both said by the Almighty, why were they not [both] written in the first Tablets? It is possible that in both the first and second Tablets, [only] <i>remember</i> was written, and Moses explained to Israel that <i>observe</i> was [also] said with it. This is indeed the true intent [of the saying of the Rabbis that “<i>remember</i> and <i>observe</i> were both spoken with one utterance]”. And in the Midrash of Rabbi Nechunya ben Hakanah,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">417</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sefer Habahir, 182. See Vol. I, p. 24, Note 42.</i> the Sages have mentioned also a great secret in this matter of <i>remember</i> and <i>observe</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">418</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See my Hebrew commentary, p. 399.</i> Generally, [in the mystic lore], remembrance is at daytime and observance is at night, and this is the intent of what the Sages used to say on the Sabbath-eve at twilight [when welcoming the Sabbath]:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">419</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Baba Kamma 32b.</i> “Come, O Bride; Come, O Bride; Come, let us go forth to meet the Sabbath, the Queen, the Bride.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">420</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“The Queen, the Bride.” In our Gemara: “the Bride, the Queen.” — These words of welcome constitute to this day the official reception of the Sabbath in the Synagogue service as the worshippers bid “the Sabbath bride” come in peace.</i> And the Sages call the blessing that is recited [over the <i>Kiddush</i>-cup] on the Sabbath-day “the great <i>Kiddush</i>,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">421</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Pesachim 106a.</i> for it is the sanctification of the Great One.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">422</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ma’or V’shamesh.</i> Understand this.<br>It is also true that the attribute of “remembering” is alluded to in a positive commandment and issues forth from the attribute of love to that of mercy, for he who does his master’s command is beloved of him and his master shows him mercy. But the attribute of “observing” is alluded to in a negative commandment, which goes to the attribute of justice and issues forth from that of fear, for he who guards himself from doing anything which does not please his master does so out of fear for him. It is for this reason that a positive commandment is greater than a negative commandment,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">423</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The question arises: Since, as Ramban writes, a positive commandment is greater than a negative one, why are all punishments for violation of the precepts specified in the Torah only for the negative commandments? This would indicate that the negative commandments are stricter than the positive ones, and indeed, the Rabbis in the Talmud do speak of the negative commandments as being stricter than the positive. Why then did Ramban write that the positive ones are greater? See my Hebrew commentary, p. 399, for lengthy discussion of this problem. In conclusion, the answer presented is as follows: Ramban did not write that a positive commandment is “stricter” than a negative one; he wrote only “greater.” Fulfillment of a Divine positive commandment represents an act of “doing good,” while observance of a negative precept is an expression of one’s “departing from evil.” Between the two — doing good and departing from evil — the former indeed represents “a greater” expression of man’s active dedication to the Divine service. Hence Ramban’s statement above. As for the stricter punishment of the negative commandments, see further in text and also Note 427.</i> just as love is greater than fear, for he who fulfills and observes the will of his master with his body and his possessions is greater than he who guards himself from doing that which is not pleasing to him. This is why the Rabbis have said<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">424</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shabbath 132 b, etc.</i> that a positive commandment overrides a negative commandment. And it is for this reason that punishment for violation of the negative commandments is great, — the court punishing the transgressor with whipping or death — whereas no punishment at all is meted out in the case of failure to fulfill the positive commandments, excepting when one is in brazen rebelliousness, such as when he says, “I shall not take the <i>lulav</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">371</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“The Palm-branch.” See Leviticus 23:40.</i> I shall not make fringes [on my four-cournered garment],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">425</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 15:38.</i> I shall not make a tabernacle.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">426</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 23:42.</i> In these cases, the Sanhedrin would whip him until he accepts upon himself to do them, or until he dies.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">427</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This rule applies only if the time of the performance is still applicable, but if, for example, the festival of Tabernacles has passed, he is not to be punished for his failure to observe the commandment. See Maimonides’, “The Commandments,” Vol. II, p. 423, where it is clearly so explained. Ramban’s intent is obvious: The violation of a negative commandment entails an act on the part of the sinner, which goes in direct opposition to the King’s command. Hence the punishment is “stricter” than in the case of a violation of a positive commandment, which entails only failure to act in accordance with the King’s desire. Hence if the time for fulfillment of the positive commandment has not yet passed and he is in open defiance of the law, the court may act against him, but if the time for fulfillment has passed, no punishment is to be imposed on him.</i><br>In explanation of the word <i>zachor</i> (remember) — [<i>remember the Sabbath-day</i>] — Rashi wrote: “Take care always to remember the Sabbath-day, so that if a food of good quality happens to come your way, you should put it away for the Sabbath.” This is a Beraitha<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">428</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Note 209 in <i>Seder Bo</i>.</i> taught in the Mechilta<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">429</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mechilta on the verse here.</i> in the following way: “Rabbi Eleazar the son of Chananyah the son of Chizkiyah the son of Garon says: ‘<i>Remember the Sabbath-day, to keep it holy</i>, and remember it from the first day of the week, so that if a good portion happens to come your way, prepare it for the Sabbath.’” But this [Beraitha in the Mechilta] is taught in the name of a single Sage and is not the final decision of the law. In the Gemara,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">430</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Beitza 16a. For the word “Gemara,” see Note 204 in <i>Seder Bo</i>.</i> we find that the Rabbis have said: “We have been taught [in the Beraitha]: They have told about Shammai the Elder that all his life, he ate in honor of the Sabbath. How so? If he found a beautiful animal to buy, he would say, ‘This one will be in honor of the Sabbath.’ On the following day, if he would find a more beautiful one, he left the second one for the Sabbath, and ate the first.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">431</sup><i class=\"footnote\">His eating the first one thus entailed something on which the honor of the Sabbath had rested (see Rashi in Beitza 16 a). Thus all his life he ate in honor of the Sabbath.</i> But Hillel the Elder was guided by another principle. All his deeds were for the sake of Heaven, as it is said, <i>Blessed be the Eternal, day by day He beareth our burden</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">432</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 68:20. Hillel was thus confident that before the Sabbath, G-d would provide him with his proper needs (Rashi, Beitza).</i> We have also been so taught [in another Beraitha]: The School of Shammai say that on the first day of the week, you should begin preparing for your Sabbath. And the School of Hillel say: <i>Blessed be the Eternal, day by day He beareth our burden</i>.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">432</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 68:20. Hillel was thus confident that before the Sabbath, G-d would provide him with his proper needs (Rashi, Beitza).</i> And in another Mechilta<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">433</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the Mechilta of Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai (Hoffman edition, p. 107). For the significance of the expression “<i>another</i> Mechilta,” see Vol. I, p. 603, Note 245.</i> we find: “Shammai the Elder says: ‘Remembering’ — [<i>Remember the Sabbath-day</i>] — means remember it before it comes; ‘observing’ — [<i>Observe the Sabbath-day</i>]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">406</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 5:12.</i> — means observe it when it comes. It was told of Shammai the Elder that the memory of the Shabbath never left his lips. If he bought a good article he would say, ‘This is for the Sabbath;’ a new garment, he would say ‘This is for the Sabbath.’ But Hillel the Elder was guided by another principle, for he would say, ‘Let all thy deeds be done for the sake of Heaven.’” And the accepted decision is like that of the School of Hillel. [Thus it is clear that Rashi’s explanation is like that of Shammai the Elder, or of the School of Shammai, while the accepted decision of law is like that of Hillel or that of the School of Hillel.]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">434</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See my Hebrew commentary, p. 400, for Mizrachi’s defense of Rashi’s explanation.</i><br>In line with the plain meaning of Scripture, the Rabbis have said<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">435</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the Mechilta quote further on. See Note 442.</i> that this verse commands us that we should always remember the Sabbath on every day, so that we should neither forget it nor confuse it with the other days.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">436</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If each of the days of the week were to have a name of its own — such as Sunday, Monday, etc. — then the Sabbath-day is confused with the other days.

The meaning of <i>l’kadsho</i> (to keep it holy) is that our remembrance of it should be to the end that it be holy to us, just as He said, <i>and call the Sabbath a delight, the sacred of the Eternal honorable</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">438</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 58:13.</i> The purport of this is that the resting thereon should be ours because it is a holy day, [which enables us] to turn away from our mental preoccupations and the vanities of the times and instead to give delight to our souls in the ways of G-d, and go to the Sages and to the prophets to hear the words of G-d. This is just as it is said, <i>Wherefore wilt thou go to him</i> [the prophet] <i>today? it is neither New Moon nor Sabbath</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">439</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Kings 4:23.</i> for such was their custom. And so did our Rabbis of blessed memory say:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">440</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rosh Hashanah 16b.</i> “From this you learn that on the New Moon and on the Sabbath one must go [to the prophet].” This is the reason [that the Torah commanded us concerning the resting of cattle on the Sabbath], i.e., in order that we should harbor no thought of it in our hearts.

And in the Mechilta we find:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">442</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mechilta on the verse here.</i> “Rabbi Yitzchak says: ‘You should not count [the days of the week] as others count them. Rather you should count them with reference to the Sabbath.’” The meaning of this is that other nations count the days of the week in such a manner that each is independent of the other. Thus they call each day by a separate name or by a name of the ministers [in heaven, such as Sunday, which means “sun’s day,” Monday which means “moon’s day,” etc.], or by any other names which they call them. But Israel counts all days with reference to the Sabbath: “one day after the Sabbath,” “two days after the Sabbath.” This is of the essence of the commandment which we have been obligated always to remember the Sabbath every day [of the week]. This is the literal meaning of the verse, and so did Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra interpret it.<br>And I say further that this is the intent of Shammai the Elder’s interpretation [mentioned above],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">433</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the Mechilta of Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai (Hoffman edition, p. 107). For the significance of the expression “<i>another</i> Mechilta,” see Vol. I, p. 603, Note 245.</i> who explained the command <i>remember</i> as meaning “[remember the Sabbath] before it comes.” That is to say, we should by no means forget it. [By counting the days of the week with reference to the Sabbath, forgetting it will thus be impossible.] But in the Beraitha [quoted above], they also mentioned a degree of his piety, i.e., that he would remember the Sabbath even in his eating, for all his life he ate in honor of the Sabbath. Now Hillel himself agreed to the interpretation of Shammai [that we are to count the days of the week with reference to the Sabbath], but in food-matters he followed another principle, for all of his deeds were for the sake of Heaven, and he trusted in G-d that He would provide him with a better portion for the Sabbath than that of all the other days of the week.<br>However, our Rabbis have yet another Midrash on the word <i>l’kadsho</i> (to keep it holy),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">443</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the Mechilta mentioned further in the text.</i> namely, that we are to sanctify it by utterance of words. This is similar in usage to the verse, <i>And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">444</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 25:10.</i> which requires the sanctification of the court, i.e., that they say of the Jubilee year, “It is hallowed!

Sanctify it by reciting a blessing. Based on this verse, the Rabbis have said: ‘On its entrance, proclaim the sanctity of the Sabbath over wine. But from this verse, I know only the sanctification for the day. Whence do we know that this applies also for the night? [We know it] from the words of Scripture, <i>And ye shall keep the Sabbath</i>.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">447</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 31:14. Since the word “day” is not mentioned in this verse, as it is in the verse before us, <i>Remember the Sabbath-'day’ to keep it holy</i>, it indicates that the proclamation of the Sabbath is to be observed at its entrance at night.

However, the duty to recite it on the day itself is but an <i>asmachta</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">449</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “Support.” Where a law is actually of Rabbinic origin but a Scriptural text is quoted as a support, it is called an <i>asmachta</i>.</i> and [the <i>kiddush</i> at daytime] contains no reference to the holiness of the day — [since only a benediction over the wine is recited] — because it is sufficient that we proclaimed the sanctity of the Sabbath once at its entrance. So also is the recital [of the sanctity of the Sabbath] over wine only an <i>asmachta</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">449</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “Support.” Where a law is actually of Rabbinic origin but a Scriptural text is quoted as a support, it is called an <i>asmachta</i>.</i> and is not at all a fixed part of the commandment itself.<br>And in the Gemara Pesachim,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">450</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Pesachim 106a.</i> the Rabbis have said: “<i>Remember the Sabbath-day, to keep it holy</i>. That is, remember it over wine at its entrance. From this, I know only that it be done at daytime. Whence do we know that it must be done at night? It is from the Scriptural words, <i>the Sabbath-'day.’</i> [On the version of the Beraitha, the Sages of the Gemara asked]: ‘This Tanna<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">451</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A Rabbi mentioned in a Mishnah or Beraitha.</i> is seeking to find a basis for the sanctification at night, and he mentions a verse which speaks of the day! Besides, the main sanctification is at nighttime!’ Rather, you must learn [the above Beraitha] in this way: ‘<i>Remember the Sabbath-day, to keep it holy</i>. That is, remember it over wine at its entrance. From this, I know only that the Sabbath is to be sanctified at night.’ Whence do we know that it must be done at daytime? It is from the Scriptural words, <i>the Sabbath day</i>.” In a similar way we will explain the Mechilta [mentioned above to make it read as follows]: “From this, I know only that the sanctification of the Sabbath is to be done at night, which is the main <i>kiddush</i>. Whence do we know that it must be done at daytime, etc.,” this being but a mere <i>asmachta</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">449</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “Support.” Where a law is actually of Rabbinic origin but a Scriptural text is quoted as a support, it is called an <i>asmachta</i>.</i> And from there you will learn that this commandment [of proclaiming the sanctity of the Sabbath] is derived from the word <i>l’kadsho</i> (to sanctify it), while the expression, <i>Remember the Sabbath-day</i>, constitutes the commandment to remember it continually every day, as we have explained. However, in the number of two hundred and forty-eight positive commandments that we have been commanded to observe, both aspects are included in the one commandment of remembering the Sabbath.

Thus, [the punishment for profaning the Sabbath] is included in: <i>a jealous G-d, visiting the iniquity</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">485</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 5.</i> while [the reward for he who keeps the Sabbath] is included in the verse, <i>And He showeth mercy unto the thousandth generation</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">490</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 6.</i> In the fifth commandment, which concerns the honor due to parents, He mentioned the reward because it is a positive commandment, [and as mentioned above, reward is for fulfillment of the positive commandments].<br>With reference to the writing on the Tablets of law, it would appear that the first five commandments were on one Tablet, for they are for the glory of the Creator, as I have mentioned, and the second five commandments were on another Tablet. Thus there were five opposite five, something like the Rabbis mentioned in the Book of Creation:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">494</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sefer Yetzirah 1:3. This is one of the earliest books on the Cabala. Saadia Gaon was among the first great scholars to write a commentary on it.

It would appear that it is this that our Rabbis, of blessed memory, have alluded to in saying<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">496</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shemoth Rabbah 41:7.</i> that the two Tablets correspond to heaven and earth,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">497</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the Torah was the instrument with which the world was created, the first Tablet containing our duties towards G-d thus corresponds to heaven, while the second Tablet which states our duties to man corresponds to earth (Eitz Yoseph, <i>ibid.</i>)</i> to a groom and bride,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">498</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The symbol is that of the bestower and the bestowed. Heaven is the bestower and earth is the bestowed. So also is the relationship between G-d and man.</i> to the two friends [of the groom and bride], and to the two worlds [this world and the World to Come].

Meanwhile, the voice of the horn waxed louder and louder.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">515</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above 19:19.</i> Then the people saw what was happening, and they moved backwards and stood further away from the boundary [that Moses had set for them].

The Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] noted in the Moreh Nebuchim<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">525</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Guide of the Perplexed, II, 33.</i> that Onkelos translated <i>but let not G-d speak with us</i> as, “Let not aught be spoken to us from before G-d.” However, he did not paraphrase in [a similar manner] in other such places, for he translated literally, <i>And G-d spoke all these words</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">526</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 1.</i> and so also in all places where it says, <i>And the Eternal spoke unto Moses</i>!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">527</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 6:10, etc.</i> Now the reason for Onkelos’ paraphrasing it here, [according to Maimonides], was that even though all Israel heard the first commandment,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">528</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Reference is to the first two commandments, for we heard both of them from the Almighty Himself, as explained above. See also above, Note 392.</i> their capacity for comprehending it was unlike that of Moses our teacher.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">529</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Therefore, with reference to Moses, Onkelos translated literally, <i>And G-d spoke</i>, for Moses achieved the highest comprehension humanly possible in prophecy, and therefore he received the word of G-d directly. But where the people were concerned, since their comprehension was of a far lesser degree, Onkelos translated, “from before G-d.”</i> But if [Maimonides’ opinion is correct], why did Onkelos translate literally, <i>For I have talked with you from heaven</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">530</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 19. Now here it refers to G-d speaking to the people, and yet Onkelos did not paraphrase it!</i> when he should have rendered it, “It was spoken to you from before Me!” Similarly in the Book of Deuteronomy, he translated literally: <i>These words the Eternal spoke unto all your assembly</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">531</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 5:19.</i> [and he did not paraphrase it]! So also he translated literally their words, <i>and we have heard His Voice</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">532</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 21.</i> which he rendered as follows: “we have heard the voice of His word; this day we have seen that G-d speaks with man!” Likewise he translated literally, <i>The Eternal spoke with you face to face</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">533</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 5.</i> Moreover, [with reference to Moses] he translated, <i>And G-d answered him by a voice</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">515</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above 19:19.</i> as “and from before G-d he was answered by a voice!” [Here Onkelos paraphrased it with regard to Moses himself, which according to Maimonides he should have translated literally!] In fact, such usage already occurs in the Torah with reference to Moses himself! Thus: <i>And he heard the Voice speaking</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">534</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew is <i>midabeir</i>, not <i>m’dabeir</i> (speaking), and Rashi markedly comments that it means “uttering itself” and Moses heard it of himself.

In the entire Revelation, we find Israel hearing G-d’s word only <i>out of the midst of the fire</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">532</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 21.</i> and this is what they comprehended. Similarly, <i>that I have talked with you from heaven</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">530</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 19. Now here it refers to G-d speaking to the people, and yet Onkelos did not paraphrase it!</i> means, by way of the Truth, “from out of the midst of heaven,” and it is identical with <i>out of the midst of the fire</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">532</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 21.</i> The purport thereof has already been explained.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">537</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 19:20.</i> Now when Onkelos saw here the expression, <i>but let not G-d speak with us</i>, [which indicates <i>direct</i> revelation], and no “partition” is mentioned, he did not deem it fit to translate literally. [That would have implied that in their comprehension of the Revelation, they were equal to Moses], and since in his language [i.e., Aramaic] there is no epithet for the word <i>Elokim</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">538</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Throughout his translation, Onkelos does not distinguish between <i>Elokim</i> and the Tetragrammaton. He translates both alike: <i>Ado-noy</i>.</i> he therefore negated here any direct communication to them, [and translated, “Let not aught <i>be spoken</i> to us <i>from before G-d</i>”].<br>Now the amazing thing in Onkelos’ wisdom is that in the Revelation on Mount Sinai, he did not mention “the Glory of G-d,” or “the word of G-d,” but instead translated: “Behold, I will reveal Myself to you;”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">539</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 19:9. The verse reads: <i>Behold, I come unto thee</i>.</i> “G-d will reveal Himself in the sight of all the people upon Mount Sinai;”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">540</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 11. the verse reads: <i>the Eternal will come down</i>.</i> “because He revealed Himself upon it;”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">541</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 18. The verse reads: <i>because the Eternal descended upon it</i>.</i> “And G-d revealed Himself upon Mount Sinai.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">542</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 20. The verse reads: <i>And the Eternal came down</i>.</i> He did not translate, “and the Glory of G-d revealed itself,” as he translated the expression, <i>the mountain of G-d</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">543</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 3:1.</i> at the beginning [of this book] as “the mountain upon which the Glory of G-d revealed itself.” Likewise, Onkelos did so regarding this descent [upon Mount Sinai]; wherever the Proper Name of G-d [i.e., the Tetragrammaton] is mentioned, [he did not translate “the Glory of G-d”]. But when Scripture mentioned <i>Elokim</i>, such as <i>towards ‘ha’Elokim,’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">544</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 19:17.</i> he translated “towards the word of G-d.” Similarly, he translated <i>‘ha’Elokim’ is come</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">545</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 17.</i> as “the Glory of G-d has revealed itself to you,” and he did not render it “G-d has revealed Himself to you.” Likewise, [he translated <i>where ‘ha’Elokim’ was</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">546</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 18.</i> as] “where the Glory of G-d was.” And so also he translated [<i>‘v’ha’Elokim’ answered him by a voice</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">547</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 19:19.</i> as] “and from before G-d, he was answered with a voice.” All this is clear and lucid to him who comprehends our words explained above.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">548</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 20. Also in Vol. I, pp. 550-552.</i> Similarly, I have seen in carefully-edited texts of Onkelos that he translated literally the verse, <i>And Moses went up into ‘har’ha’Elokim’ (the mount of G-d)</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">549</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 24:13.</i> Since it was after the Giving of the Torah, [he translated even the name <i>Elokim</i> literally, and he did not render it, “and Moses went up into the mountain upon which the Glory of G-d revealed itself”], and so it is written, <i>And they set forward from the mount of the Eternal</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">550</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 10:33.</i>"

                    "FOR G-D IS COME IN ORDER TO ‘NASOTH’ YOU. “I.e., to make you ‘great’ in the world, [to ensure] that you obtain a name amongst the nations [because of the fact] that He in His Glory revealed Himself to you. <i>Nasoth</i> is a term for ‘exalting’ and ‘greatness,’ just as in the verses: <i>Lift up a ‘neis’ (an ensign);</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">551</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 62:10.</i> <i>‘k’neis’ (as an ensign) on a hill</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">552</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 30:17.</i> which is so called because it is high.” Thus Rashi’s language. But this is not correct.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">553</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi connects <i>nasoth</i> with <i>neis</i> (ensign, banner). Ramban objects to this because in his opinion, the root of the word <i>nasoth</i> is <i>nasoh</i> (try, accustom).</i> Instead, it is possible that Moses is saying that “it is in order to get you ‘accustomed’ to have faith in Him that G-d is come. Since He has shown you the Revelation of the Divine Presence, your faith in Him has entered your hearts to cleave to Him, and your souls will never be separated from it forever. <i>And that His fear may be before you</i> when you see that He alone is G-d in heaven and upon the earth, you will have great fear of Him.” It may be that Moses is saying that “the fear of <i>this great fire</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">554</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 5:22.</i> will be before you, and you will not sin because of your fear of it.” And the word <i>nasoth</i> is similar in expression to the verses: <i>And he</i> [David] <i>assayed to go, but could not, for he had ‘nisah’ (tried) it. And David said unto Saul: I cannot go with these; for I have not ‘nisithi’ (tried) them</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">555</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 17:39.</i> something like “accustomed.”<br>The Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] has said in the Moreh Nebuchim<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">556</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Guide of the Perplexed, III, 24. The Hebrew text here follows Al Charizi’s translation, and not that of Ibn Tibbon.</i> that Moses said to the people, “<i>Fear not</i>, because the purpose of that which you have seen is that when the Eternal G-d, in order to demonstrate your faithfulness to Him, will test you by sending you a false prophet who will aim to reverse that which you have heard, your steps will never slide from the way of the truth, for you have seen the truth with your own eyes.” But if so, the sense of the verse, [according to Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon], is that “in order to be able to prove you <i>in the future</i>, G-d came now so that you should remain faithful to Him in all trials.”<br>In my opinion, the real “trial” is now, [and not as Rambam has it that “He now came in order to be able to prove you in the future”]. Moses is saying: “Now G-d wanted to try you whether you will keep His commandments,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">557</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Deuteronomy 8:2.</i> since He has now removed all doubt from your hearts. From now on, He will see <i>whether ye do love Him</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">558</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 13:4.</i> and whether you want Him and His commandments.” So also does every expression of <i>nisayon</i> mean “test,” such as: <i>I cannot go with these; for I have not ‘nisithi’ them</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">555</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 17:39.</i> which means “I have never tried to walk with them.”<br>It is possible that this “trial” is for the good [of the one who is being tried],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">559</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Vol. I, p. 275.</i> for the master will sometimes try his servant with hard work in order to know whether he will endure it out of his love for him. Sometimes he will do him good in order to know whether he will requite him with additional service and honor for the good he has done him. This is similar to what the Sages have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">560</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shemoth Rabbah 31:2.</i> “Happy is the person who stands through his trials, for there is no man whom the Holy One, blessed be He, does not try. He tries the rich to see if his hand will be open for the poor; He tries the poor if he can bear suffering, etc.” This is why Scripture says here: “G-d has been good to you in showing you His Glory, which <i>He hath not dealt with any nation</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">561</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 147:20.</i> in order to prove you whether you will requite Him according to the good He has done to you <i>to be unto Him a people of inheritance</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">562</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 4:20.</i> similar to what He said, <i>Do ye thus requite the Eternal?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">563</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 32:6.</i> And it is said. “<i>You only have I known of all the families of the earth; therefore I will visit upon you all your iniquities</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">564</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Amos 3:2.</i> for the nations are not obligated to me as are you, whom I have known face to face.”"

                    "YE YOURSELVES HAVE SEEN THAT I HAVE TALKED WITH YOU FROM HEAVEN.

In my opinion, the explanation of the verse is as follows: “Do not make gods of silver or gods of gold to be to you for gods with Him; <i>and ye shall not make them</i> altogether.” Thus He warned against believing in them, and again warned against merely making them, similar to the verse, <i>Neither shall ye rear you up a graven image, or a pillar</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">566</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 26:1.

This is to prohibit the touching of the stones of the altar with an iron tool, just as He said, <i>Thou shalt build the altar of the Eternal thy G-d of unhewn stones;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">585</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 27:6.</i> <i>thou shalt lift up no iron tool upon them</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">586</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 5.</i> He mentioned iron here by the term <i>cherev</i> (sword), because all iron tools that have sharp edges are called <i>cherev</i>. Thus it is said of a sword, <i>And Ehud made him ‘cherev’ (a sword) which had two edges;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">587</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Judges 3:16.</i> and of a blade it is said, <i>Take thee a sharp ‘cherev’ (sword)</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">588</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 5:1.</i> Of hatchet and hammers with which a building is demolished it is said, <i>And he shall break down thy towers ‘b’charbothav’ (with his axes)</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">589</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 26:9.</i> Similarly, an iron tool with which stones are cut is called <i>cherev</i>.<br>According to our Rabbis,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">592</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mechilta on the verse here.</i> the reason for the commandment [against building an altar of stones which have been touched by iron] is the glorification of the altar: [It is not right] that that which shortens life [i.e., iron] is to be lifted up against that which prolongs life. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra said that this is in order that the chips of the stones should not remain in the dunghills, while part of them [i.e., the stones] is built into G-d’s altar, or that the chips should not be taken to make an altar for the idols, since their worshippers might do so, hoping that perhaps this will bring them success. And the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] wrote in Moreh Nebuchim<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">593</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Guide of the Perplexed, III, 45.</i> that this prohibition is an extraordinary precaution against making stones into certain shapes, thus being hewn stones, for such was the custom of the heathens [to build their altars with hewn stones].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">594</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus by prohibiting the building of an altar with stones which have been touched by iron, the Torah gave us an extraordinary precaution to guard against idolatry.</i><br>But I say that the reason for the commandment is that a sword is made out of iron and is the destroyer of the world. In fact, this is why it is called <i>cherev</i> (sword) [which is of the same root as <i>churban</i> (destruction)]. And since Esau whom G-d hated<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">595</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Malachi 1:3.</i> is the inheritor of the sword — for to him it was said, <i>And by thy sword shalt thou live</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">596</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 27:40.</i> — and the sword is his power in heaven and upon the earth — for with [the power of] Mars and the stars [which influence] bloodshed, the sword succeeds, and with them Esau’s might is shown — therefore it must not be brought into the House of G-d. It is this reason which Scripture mentions expressly: “You should not build [the altar] of hewn stones, for in lifting up any iron to make them, you have lifted up your murderous sword, and increased victims; and thus you have profaned it.” It was for this reason that there was no iron in the Tabernacle, for even its pins, which would have been better if made of iron, were made of copper.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">597</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 27:19.</i> Similarly, in the Sanctuary<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">598</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “The Permanent House,” a synonym for the Sanctuary in Jerusalem, which cannot be built in any other location. It stands in contrast to the Tabernacle, which could be moved from place to place.</i> there were no vessels of iron except the ritual slaughtering-knives, for slaughtering [of the sacrifice] was not an act of “worship” [requiring a priest].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">599</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yoma 42a.</i><br>Scripture prohibited only the building of an altar with hewn stones if touched by iron, for so it is clearly stated, <i>when thou lifteth up thy sword upon it thou has profaned it</i>, and still more clearly, <i>thou shalt lift up no iron tool upon it</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">586</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 5.</i> But if he comes to chisel them with silver tools or the <i>shamir</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">600</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A worm that pierced stones with its touch.</i> which our Rabbis have mentioned,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">601</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sotah 48b.</i> it is permissible, even though the stones are not whole. This law will refute the reasoning of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">602</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If, as Ibn Ezra suggested, the reason for the commandment is that the chips of the stones should not be on a dunghill while the stones be in the altar of G-d, why then is it permissible if the chiselling is done with a silver tool? The same question applies to Rambam’s explanation that the commandment is a precautionary measure against idolatry.</i> The reason advanced by the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] is also incorrect on account of this law.<br>Now [when building the Sanctuary], Solomon added a stricture in the commandment, i.e., that <i>no tool of iron was heard in the House while it was in building</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">603</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Kings 6:7.</i> even though it was permissible, [the prohibition applying only to the altar]. Thus we were taught in the Mechilta:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">604</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mechilta on the verse here.</i> “<i>Thou shalt not build it of hewn stones</i>. You are not allowed to build the altar of hewn stones, but you may build the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies of hewn stones. And how do I explain the verse, <i>And there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the House, while it was in building?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">603</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Kings 6:7.</i> They were not heard ‘in the House,’ but outside of the House they were heard.” What happened was thus as follows: They would remove the stones from their mountains with iron tools and chisel them there with iron, just as they also cut with iron the trees and the cypresses<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">605</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 31.</i> which were in the House. And so it is written, <i>And they quarried great stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the House with hewn stone</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">606</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 31.</i> When they brought them to the House to build the walls, they did not fix them with iron, nor did they lift up any iron tool upon them as is the custom of builders. And that which Scripture says, <i>It was built of whole stones from the quarry</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">603</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Kings 6:7.</i> does not mean that they were whole and complete; they were whole only insomuch as they had no notch deep enough for the nail to halt over on passing upon the edge,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">607</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chullin 18a.</i> but they were smooth and even. The meaning of the word <i>masa</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">608</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>It was built of whole stones ‘masa’</i> (I Kings 6:7) is generally translated “at the quarry.” Ramban interprets <i>masa</i> to mean “great,” and the sense of the verse is: “it was built of whole large stones.”</i> is “great”; for when they moved them from the mountain, they did not divide the rocks into many stones as is the custom of the builders, and they did not fix them there, nor did they set them into the building with hammers or axes as any other building is built. Solomon did not want it to be built [with any iron tool], or that the sound of iron be even heard in the whole Mount of the House. All these strictures were for the purpose of removing iron from it. This is according to the opinion of Rabbi Yirmiyah in Tractate Sotah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">609</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sotah 48b. In our Gemara: Rabbi Nechemyah.</i> But according to Rabbi Yehudah, the hewn stones were for Solomon’s own house, not for the Sanctuary. According to his opinion, the verse stating, <i>And they quarried great stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the house with hewn stone</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">606</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 31.</i> means that they also quarried hewn stones which were for his own house. So also it appears from the plain meaning of Scripture, that he built the court with hewn stone, as it is written, <i>And he built the inner court with three rows of hewn stone</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">610</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Kings 6:36.</i> and he placed himself under restriction [to build with unhewn stone] only in the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies. All this was for the sake of removing iron from the Sanctuary.

Thus we find that the first of the Ten Commandments dealt with the obligation of knowing of the existence of G-d, and the second one with the prohibition against idolatry, after which [following the giving of the Ten Commandments] He again instructed Moses, saying, <i>Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel: Ye yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 20:19.</i> meaning that you, [Moses] should warn them again to take to heart that which they have seen, so that they will be careful to keep these precepts which I have commanded them.

Even so it is forbidden for the litigant to set him up as a judge and complain before him so that he orders the other party to come to court before him, and the layman himself is also forbidden to act as their judge. Now even though the Sages have mentioned these two groups [the layman and the Canaanite] together, there is a difference between them, in that if the two litigants are willing to come before an Israelite who is a layman, and accept him upon themselves, it is permissible for them to do so, and they must abide by his decision, but to come before the Canaanites to act as judges between them, is forbidden under all circumstances, even if the Canaanite laws are in that particular case the same as our laws."

This process repeats itself seven times — representing a total of forty-nine thousand years, the fiftieth thousand being the jubilee when all existence returns to its beginnings.

It appears to me that the master takes the place of the husband [in this respect]. For the Torah had compassion on the wife and children, whose lives are hanging in suspense,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Deuteronomy 28:66.</i> and who expect [to be supported from] the husband’s earnings, since now that he is sold as a servant, they are in danger of being lost in their misery. Therefore the Torah commanded the master who is now entitled to the servant’s labor, to act towards them as he [the servant] would. If so, the master only has to assume the responsibilities of the husband, [and no more]; thus he is entitled to their labor as is the husband, and in return he must feed and support them. This is the meaning of the expression, <i>then his wife shall go out with him</i>, since the servant’s wife was together with him as a handmaid to his master, for the labor of both of them belongs to him, in return for which he is obliged to give them food. Thus the only difference between husband and wife is that the wife has a right to go away as she pleases, [and is not bound to work for her husband’s master if she does not want to be supported by him, whilst the husband, who is the servant, is bound to the master]. Similarly, the master’s obligation to support the children is limited to the time that the father is responsible for them, namely when they are minors, or as long as is customary to feed them, as Rashi explained in Tractate Kiddushin.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kiddushin 22a.

Scripture therefore says, <i>his wife</i>, thus excluding the brother’s childless widow who is waiting for him, since she is not yet his wife. <i>With him</i>, this excludes the betrothed who, [even though she is his wife], is not yet <i>with him</i>.” This Mechilta is a proof to the law which I have stated, for since it is not customary for the betrothed and the childless brother’s widow to be supported by the man [in this case the servant], therefore the Torah did not impose their support upon the master either. And even if the brother-in-law or the bridegroom became liable by law at a certain time known in the Talmud<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to a first [i.e., an older] Mishnah, if after such time as the law allows for the preparation of the wedding, the bridegroom postponed it, he is liable to support her, and she may eat from his goods, so that if she is an Israelite’s daughter and betrothed to a priest, she may eat <i>terumah</i> (the heave-offering) as if she was already his wife. A later Mishnah though, ruled that a woman may not eat heave-offering until she has entered the bride-chamber (Kethuboth 57 b).</i> to support them, that obligation was in the nature of other debts they may have, and therefore the master did not become liable to support them.<br>Again I have found in another Mechilta of Rabbi Shimon:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Hoffman’s edition, p. 120. — See Vol. I, p. 603, Note 245, for explanation of the term “another.”</i> “<i>If he be married then his wife shall go out with him</i>. Just as the master is obliged to feed the servant, so he is obliged to feed his wife and children. Still I might say: if the servant had a wife and children before he was bought, then his master is obliged to feed them, because he bought him on that condition, but if he had a wife and children only after he was bought I might think that his master is not obliged to feed them. Scripture therefore says, <i>if he be married</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “if he be the husband of a <i>wife</i>, then his <i>wife</i> shall go out with him.” The word “wife” is thus mentioned twice, once to indicate etc. (see text).</i> etc. There are thus two wives mentioned here, one referring to a wife that he had before his master bought him, and the other referring to a wife he had after he was bought. I might think that even if he had just a betrothed wife, or a childless brother’s widow who is waiting for him, whom the servant himself is not obliged to feed, that nonetheless his master is obliged to support them, and proof for that argument I might find in the fact that the husband himself is not obliged [by law of the Torah, as explained above] to feed his own wife and children, and yet, the master of the servant is obliged to feed the wife and children of his servant; Scripture therefore says, <i>then his wife shall go out with him</i> — that wife who is <i>with him</i>, the master is obliged to feed, but he is not bound to feed a wife who is not <i>with him</i>. I might think that even if the servant’s wife was one with whom it is not correct for him to continue living — such as a widow married to a High Priest, or a divorcee or profaned woman married to a common priest<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Leviticus 21:7;14.</i> — [that the master is bound to feed her]; Scripture therefore says, <i>then his wife shall go out with him</i> — one that is fit to live <i>with him</i>, but not this one etc. I might think that even if he married without the master’s knowledge [the master is obliged to feed her]; Scripture therefore says, <i>if ‘he’ be married</i> — just as ‘he’ was acquired with the master’s knowledge, so his wife [whom the master must support] means one taken with the master’s knowledge. I might think that the earnings of his sons and daughters belong to the master, and it is logical that it be so: for if we see in the case of a Canaanite bondman, whose master is not bound to feed him, that nonetheless the earnings of his sons and daughters belong to the master, then surely it is logical that in the case of a Hebrew servant, whose master is obliged to feed him, that the earnings of his sons and daughters should belong to his master! Scripture therefore says: <i>he (if ‘he’ be married)</i> — it is he whose earnings belong to his master, but not those of his sons and daughters. <i>Then his wife shall go out with him</i> — do not separate him from his wife; do not separate him from his children.” Thus far the language of this Beraitha.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Seder Bo</i>, Note 209.</i><br>Yet I continue to say<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In spite of the fact that this Beraitha apparently contradicts what Ramban said above — namely, that during the time of the Hebrew servant’s servitude the earnings of his wife and minor children belong to his master, since he is obliged to feed them, whereas here the Beraitha seems to be saying the opposite — “Yet I continue to say” writes Ramban, “as I have written above etc.”</i> as I have written above, that if the servant’s wife and children want to be supported by the master, that he may take their earnings, and this Beraitha quoted above intends only to tell us that they are not his by absolute right, as is the law of the Canaanite bondman, or as is the law of the Hebrew servant himself, [who must of necessity work for their master], but they [the wife and children of the Hebrew servant] can say to him: “We will not be fed by you, and we will not work for you.” What is new in this Beraitha is that if the servant married without the consent of his master, he is not bound to feed the wife or her children, for since it is within the power of his master to give him a Canaanite bondmaid, he is not obliged to feed this Israelite woman. The Rabbis further interpreted the word <i>imo</i> (with him) to teach us that you are not to separate him from his wife and children, which means to say that the master cannot tell him: “Be together with the handmaid I gave you and sleep with her at night, and not with the Israelite wife,” but the servant has the right to choose for himself."

For if we say [as the Beraitha above attempted to,] that the verse here speaks of an Israelite woman, it could no longer refer to the case of a father selling his minor daughter, about whom the law is given that when she shows signs of puberty she goes free, for how could the master give her as a wife to his Hebrew servant, since he has no power to hand her over to any other man [except to designate her to be his own wife, or that of his son — as is explained further in Verses 8-9]!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Accordingly, the Beraitha above that attempted to argue that Scripture here speaks of an Israelite woman [given by the master to his Hebrew servant], must refer only to a Hebrew woman <i>of age</i> who sold herself as a maidservant. So how then could Rashi support his argument [that if she were an Israelite woman, she would go free “if she shows signs of puberty],” when the Beraitha must of necessity be referring not to a minor but to a woman of age?

Now if so, the case of a woman who goes free at the end of six years can only be when her father sold her [as a minor, but in that case the master has no right to give her as a wife to his Hebrew servant, but only to designate her as his own wife or that of his son]!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">So both proofs of Rashi as to why Scripture cannot be speaking here of an Israelite woman, [1. that a Hebrew maidservant also goes free at the end of six years; 2. that even before the end of six years, she goes free if she shows signs of puberty], have no application here for reasons explained above.</i><br>But that which the Rabbis have said [in the Beraitha above, on the basis of the verse, <i>the wife and her children shall be the master’s</i>]: “Consequently, Scripture must be speaking of a Canaanite woman” — the meaning thereof is as follows: Since He stated, <i>the wife and her children shall be the master’s</i> [it must be speaking only of a Canaanite woman], for the children of a Canaanite bondmaid are the master’s since her child has the same status as she does, but in the case of an Israelite woman — even if she were of age [in which case her master could give her to his Hebrew servant as a wife], and even if we were to say that a woman may sell herself as a maidservant<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A woman really cannot sell herself; as the Mechilta puts it: “<i>And if a man sell</i> (Verse 7) — a man can sell himself, but a woman cannot sell herself.” But Ramban is writing only on the assumption that the Beraitha introduced this as a hypothesis finally to be disproved.

The author of the ‘Hilchoth Gedoloth’ thus considered this verse a negative commandment<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As opposed to a mere “negation,” where the verse just negates a certain law from being applicable, without constituting a prohibition. In his Book of the Commandments, Maimonides dedicated the eighth principle to the clarification of this distinction between a negation and a prohibition, and without mentioning the name of the author of the ‘Hilchoth Gedoloth,’ differs with him on the interpretation of this verse, which in his opinion merely states that there is no obligation on the part of the master to let her go free where he causes her the loss of one of her organs. [See in my translation, “The Commandments,” Vol. II pp. 390-393.] In his notes to Maimonides’ Book of Commandments, Ramban came to the defense of the ‘Hilchoth Gedoloth.’</i> wherein G-d warns the master that if he wants to send her out free because of the loss of a tooth or eye, that he transgresses a prohibition; but instead he is to pay her monetary compensation for the tooth or eye, and she shall stay with him up to the time [of six years, or before if she produces signs of puberty], to be designated as the master’s wife [or his son’s]. For it would be a great injustice if, after causing her the loss of a tooth in his anger and blemishing her thereby, he would then send her out of his house, when she had hoped to become his wife. Moreover, many times the monetary compensation for the damage done to the chief external organs, is more than the earnings for her labor if her days as a handmaid have nearly terminated. Therefore Scripture was strict upon the master and made a clear prohibition, so that he should not rob her of the monetary compensation due to her for the loss of any of her chief organs, even if he should want to let her go free on account of them. It may be that sending her to freedom is itself forbidden before the fixed time, for Scripture has obliged the master to support her and that she stay with him, in case she finds favor in his eyes and becomes his wife; just as He warned him with a prohibition that [after he marries her and takes another wife] <i>her food, her raiment, and her conjugal rights shall he not diminish</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">72</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 10.</i> In accordance with this opinion [the author of the ‘Hilchoth Gedoloth’] counted the verse, <i>She shall not go out as the menservants do</i> among the three hundred and sixty-five negative commandments."

Thus the verse is stating that neither the father nor the master has a right to resell her. Ramban will question this interpretation.</i> <i>Seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her</i> — if he [i.e. the master] intends to act deceitfully towards her and not to fulfill the commandment of designating her as his wife [or his son’s]. So also did her father act deceitfully towards her, by selling her to this master.” Thus far Rashi’s language. And if so, <i>l’am nochri</i> would be like <i>l’ish nochri</i> (to a strange man), but we find in all Scripture no parallel to such a usage [that <i>am</i> (people) should be understood in the sense of “man”]. Perhaps the letter <i>lamed</i> in the word <i>l’am</i> draws along with it a similar letter in the next word, thus making it: <i>‘l’am l’nochri’ he shall have no power to sell her</i>, and the explanation thereof would be similar to the verse, <i>Thou gavest him to be food ‘l’am l’tziyim’ (to the folk inhabiting the wilderness)</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">74</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 74:14.</i> where the second word <i>l’tziyim</i> explains: who is <i>the folk?</i> — the men who inhabit the wilderness; so here too He says, <i>he shall have no power to sell her ‘l’am’</i>, and He explains: who is <i>l’am? — l’nochri</i>, that is to say, to any stranger from the whole people [i.e., to another Israelite]. The term <i>nochri</i> here will then be similar in usage to the expressions: <i>and thy labors in the house of a ‘nochri’ (stranger)</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">75</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 5:10.</i> which means in the house of another man; <i>even from the ‘nochriyah’ (the strange woman) that maketh smooth her words</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">76</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 2:16.</i> meaning the woman who is not his wife.

[It was necessary for this to be stated] because in the case of a Hebrew servant He said, <i>and he sell himself unto the stranger who is a settler with thee, or to the offshoot of a stranger’s family</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">78</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 25:47.</i> therefore it had to say that this should not be done to a woman. The reason for it is obvious.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">79</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“That she not be exposed to the dangers of immorality.” (Bachya).</i> This surely is the plain meaning of Scripture, that after the father — the vendor — redeemed her from her first master, he cannot sell her to an idolator, and the same law applies to the original sale. Scripture, however, [had to state this prohibition in the case of a re-sale], because sometimes a man may very much want to redeem his daughter from a master who did not take her as his wife, and will want to sell her to an idolator for a year or two with the intention of then taking her out from him; therefore Scripture warned him against doing this. Or it may be that this expression [i.e., <i>‘l’am nochri’ he shall have no power to sell her</i>] refers back to the beginning of this subject: <i>And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">80</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 7.</i> — <i>he shall have no power to sell her to a foreign man</i>. If so, then the Rabbis’ interpretation in the Talmud<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">77</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Eleazar and Rabbi Shimon — in Kiddushin 18a.</i> that a man may not resell his daughter into the status of a handmaid, [even to an Israelite], is derived [not from <i>‘l’am nochri’ he shall have no power to sell her</i>, but] from the [apparently] superfluous expression: <i>seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her</i>. For to a non-Israelite he never has power to sell her; so why did G-d say: <i>seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her</i>, [since he cannot sell her even once to a foreign man], and the meaning of that expression is that since he acted once deceitfully with her by selling her into a status of a handmaid, he cannot do so another time? Therefore the Rabbis interpreted the verse thus: “<i>to a foreign people he shall have no power to sell her</i> [altogether], and <i>when he hath dealt deceitfully with her</i> [he also has no power to sell her];” that is to say, he shall have no power to sell her if he dealt deceitfully with her, for after he sold her once [to an Israelite], he cannot sell her again. There are many instances where the Rabbis interpreted the verses in such a manner. [Thus we find: <i>Unto the stranger that is within thy gates thou shalt give it that he may eat it, or thou mayest sell it unto a foreigner</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">81</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 14:21.</i> — which Rabbi Meir interpreted]:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">82</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Pesachim 21b.</i> “Read the verse thus: unto the stranger that is within thy gates thou shalt give it that he may eat it, or thou mayest sell it; thou shalt give it that he may eat it or thou mayest sell it unto a foreigner.” Similarly they interpreted here<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">83</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kiddushin 4a.</i> <i>then shall she go out for nothing, without money</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">84</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 11.</i> which, on account of the redundant language, [“for nothing,” “without money”] they made the basis for two additional ways of the Hebrew maidservant regaining her freedom: “<i>she shall go out for nothing</i>, and <i>she shall go out without money;</i>” thus establishing that she goes out to freedom when she produces signs of puberty, or signs of fuller development if she had no signs of puberty — this being that maturity of the barren woman, [who is incapable of conception], as is stated in the beginning of Tractate Kiddushin.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">83</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kiddushin 4a.</i><br>The plain meaning of Scripture in this section is as follows: <i>If a man sell his</i> minor <i>daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as</i> these <i>menservants</i>, [i.e., the <i>Hebrew</i> menservants] mentioned [above in Verses 2-6,] who go out to freedom in the seventh year and in the jubilee year: for the master<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">85</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the Tur who quotes Ramban: “the father.” That is to say, if the maiden pleased the master and he wishes to marry her, the father cannot take her out from his house.</i> can never send her away from his house if the maiden pleases him <i>and she obtains kindness of him</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">86</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Esther 2:9.</i> but he is to take her for a wife as is his will. <i>But if she pleaseth not her master</i>, who has not espoused her to be his wife — for he who buys an Israelite’s daughter does so with the intention of taking her as his wife, thus she is under ordinary conditions designated for him; but now if her master does not desire her, <i>then shall</i> the father mentioned <i>redeem her</i>, for as soon as the master says: “I do not want to marry her,” it is forbidden for the father to leave her any longer under his authority, nor may he sell her to a foreign people in case he comes to deal deceitfully with her, for it is deceit for a man to sell his daughter except to someone who can marry her. Or the meaning thereof may be that anyone who sells his daughter [even to an Israelite], deals deceitfully with her."

                    "AND IF ‘YI’ODENAH’ (HE ESPOUSE HER) UNTO HIS SON, HE SHALL DEAL WITH HER AFTER THE MANNER OF DAUGHTERS. In line with the plain meaning of Scripture, it is possible that G-d is saying that if the buyer <i>yi’odenah</i> for his son, which means that he espoused her to him — for the term <i>yi’ud</i> is an expression of appointing, such as: <i>he tarried longer than the set time which ‘y’ado’ (he had appointed him)</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">87</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Samuel 20:5.</i> — <i>then he shall do unto her after the manner</i> that a man does <i>for</i> his own <i>daughters</i> — he is to give her of his own <i>according to the dowry of virgins</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">88</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 22:6.</i> He thus commanded this as He did in the law of outfitting the emancipated servant,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">89</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 15:13-14.</i> and it is all an expression of His goodness, magnified be He! And in accordance with the interpretation of our Rabbis, which is the truth, the meaning of the verse is: <i>after the manner of daughters</i> whom parents marry off, <i>so shall</i> the son [of the master] <i>deal with her</i>. And then He explains [what is “the manner of daughters”] that <i>if he take him another wife, her food, her raiment, and her conjugal rights</i> — that is, of this one [the former maidservant] — <i>he shall not diminish</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">90</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 10.</i> It is obvious that if he did not marry another woman he must not diminish her rights, but Scripture speaks of that which is usual.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">91</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., if he does marry another woman he is more likely to diminish the rights of this one; hence Scripture speaks of the case <i>‘if’ he take him another wife</i>. But this is by no means to be understood that it was “the usual” thing to take another wife.</i><br>Now Rashi explained: “<i>sh’eirah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">90</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 10.</i> means food; <i>k’suthah</i> is, as the literal sense of the word, raiment; <i>onatha</i> is the marital duty.” And so did Onkelos render <i>sh’eirah: zivanah</i> (food). But in the Gemara<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">92</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kethuboth 47b. — For the meaning of the term Gemara see in <i>Seder Bo</i>, Note 204.</i> the Rabbis said with reference to the Sage who held this opinion [that <i>sh’eirah</i> means food]: “And this Tanna<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">93</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See in <i>Seder Yithro</i>, Note 451.</i> holds that the alimentation of one’s wife is a law of the Torah. For we have been taught: <i>sh’eirah</i> — this means her food, and so it says, <i>He caused ‘sh’eir’ (flesh) to rain upon them as the dust</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">94</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 78:27.</i> etc.” And from the subject under discussion in that Gemara it is understood that this is the opinion of a single Sage, whilst the accepted law is that the alimentation of one’s wife is a Rabbinical enactment. And even according to the plain meaning of Scripture, why should it mention food under the term <i>sh’eir</i> which means “flesh;” it should rather have mentioned <i>lachmah</i> (her bread), for man lives by bread<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">95</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Deuteronomy 8:3.</i> and his obligation towards her is [mainly] in that sustenance. Now Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra thought to correct this, and so he explained <i>sh’eirah</i> as meaning food which builds up her <i>sh’eir</i>, namely her flesh. But there is no sense in Scripture saying that the “husband diminish not her flesh!”<br>Therefore I say that the meaning of <i>sh’eir</i> everywhere is flesh close and near to one’s own, the root thereof being derived from the expression <i>sh’eir b’saro</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 18:6. Generally translated: “that is near of kin to him.” According to Ramban the literal meaning would be: “the flesh close and near to his flesh.”</i> that is his close flesh outside that of the flesh of his own body. Thus relatives are called <i>sh’eir: to any sh’eir b’saro’ (that is near of kin to him);</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 18:6. Generally translated: “that is near of kin to him.” According to Ramban the literal meaning would be: “the flesh close and near to his flesh.”</i> <i>they are ‘sha’arah’ (near kinswomen)</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">97</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 17.</i> this being associated with the expressions: <i>surely thou art my bone and my flesh;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">98</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 29:14.</i> <i>of whom the flesh is half consumed</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">99</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 12:12. “The flesh” here refers to Miriam — Aaron’s and Moses’ sister.</i> Similarly, <i>And I will cut off from Babylon a name, ‘ush’ar’ offshoot and offspring</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">100</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 14:22.</i> means a child related to him. Likewise, <i>when thy flesh ‘ush’eirecha’ are consumed</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">101</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 5:11.</i> which means “yourself and your children” who are the flesh closest to you. Thus meat is called <i>sh’eir — He caused ‘sh’eir’ to rain upon them as the dust</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">94</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 78:27.</i> — because meat when eaten is absorbed by the eater and becomes part of his flesh. It is possible that this is the meaning of the expression, <i>when thy flesh ‘ush’eirecha’ are consumed</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">101</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 5:11.</i> meaning: when the original flesh of your body, and the nutriment of flesh which came from the food, will be consumed and will no longer be part of your flesh. Thus a woman in relation to her husband is called <i>sh’eir</i> — just as the Rabbis interpreted:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">102</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yebamoth 22b.</i> “<i>except for ‘lish’eiro,’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">103</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 21:2.</i> <i>sh’eir</i> means his wife;” — the usage of the term being derived from the idea that G-d stated, <i>and he shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">104</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 2:24.</i> Thus <i>sh’eira</i> here means “the nearness of her flesh;” <i>k’suthah</i> is “the cover of her bed,” just as it is said, <i>for that is his only ‘k’suthoh’ (covering)… wherein shall he sleep?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">105</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 22:26.</i> and <i>onathah</i> is “her time,” that he come to her at times of love. And even if we say as some commentators do, that the meaning of <i>sh’eir</i> is like “his flesh,” and the expression, <i>to any ‘sh’eir’ b’saro’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 18:6. Generally translated: “that is near of kin to him.” According to Ramban the literal meaning would be: “the flesh close and near to his flesh.”</i> is like “to any flesh of his flesh,” just as it says, <i>for he is our brother, our flesh</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">106</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 37:27.</i> — in that case we would still explain <i>‘sh’eirah'… he shall not diminish</i> as meaning that he shall not diminish from her her flesh; that is, the flesh due to her, namely, the flesh of her husband who with her is one flesh. Thus the meaning of the verse is, that G-d says that if the master takes another wife, he shall not diminish from this one the nearness of her flesh, the cover of her bed, and her time of love, for such is <i>the manner of daughters</i>. And the intention is that the other woman should not be sitting <i>upon a stately bed</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">107</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 23:41.</i> <i>and</i> there <i>they shall be one flesh</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">104</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 2:24.</i> whilst this one is to him merely like a concubine, with whom he lives only by chance, and upon the ground, just like one comes to a harlot. It is for this reason that Scripture has forbidden him to act in this way. And so did the Sages say:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">108</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kethuboth 48a.</i> “<i>sh’eirah</i> means the nearness of flesh, that he should not behave to her as is the custom among the Persians, who perform their marital rights in their clothes.” This is a correct interpretation, for such is the style of Scripture always to mention sexual intercourse in clean and brief language. Therefore it mentions these duties by means of allusion: <i>sh’eirah k’sutha v’onatha</i>, referring to the three things which are usual when a man comes together with his wife. Thus the verse is properly explained in accordance with the accepted law, whilst alimentation of one’s wife and provision of her raiment are duties put upon the husband by ordinance of the Rabbis."

                    "AND HE THAT STEALETH A MAN, AND SELLETH HIM, AND HE BE FOUND IN HIS HAND — “previously, before the sale.” This is Rashi’s language. But I have not understood it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">119</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban argues that since Rashi made his comment upon the phrase: <i>and he be found in his hand</i>, it would appear that the fact that the witnesses saw him in his possession constitutes their proof that the holder stole him. On this, Ramban asked: could you possibly think that the thief be subject to death without the witnesses having seen the actual theft and the sale? Their having seen him in the thief’s possession is in fact no proof at all that he had stolen him (Nimukei Shmuel).</i> If Rashi means that witnesses must have seen him [the stolen person] in the thief’s possession before he had sold him — could it even enter your mind that the thief be subject to the death penalty without witnesses having seen him stealing and also seeing him selling! It would therefore have been sufficient if Scripture were to say: “and he that stealeth a man and selleth him”. Further, his being found in the thief’s possession is no real proof that he stole him! Rather, this verse is the source for that which we have been taught in a Mishnah:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">120</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 85b.</i> “He that steals a person is not liable to the punishment unless he brings him into his own possession,” and in a Beraitha the Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">120</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 85b.</i> “If he stole him but did not sell him, or if he sold him but he is still in his [the thief’s], possession, he is free [from the death penalty].” The meaning of this is to teach us that the law applying to the thief of a human being is [in one respect] similar to that of thieves of other, i.e., monetary, matters; namely, that if a thief killed or sold [an ox or a sheep] within the domain of the owner, he is free [from paying five oxen for an ox and four sheeps for a sheep],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">121</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 37.</i> but if he lifted them up [thereby acquiring possession of them], or removed them from the domain of the owner, he is liable to pay. Similarly, this thief of a human being must first have brought the stolen person into his own domain [in order to be liable to death]. Likewise if he lifted the lad upon his shoulder, and sold him to another person, he is liable to the death penalty, because this too is called <i>if he be found in his hand</i>, since it is not logical that a man’s ground should have a greater power of taking possession of a thing for the owner, than his own hand has. In a similar way, that which the Rabbis said [in the Beraitha mentioned above]: “or if he sold him but he is still in his [the thief’s] possession etc.,” means that the buyer did not remove him at all from the thief’s domain, even though he paid him the money, and since he did not remove him from there, the thief is free [from the death penalty]. Now I do not know whether this is to say that [in order to make the thief of a human being liable to the death penalty] the buyer must perform a formal act of acquisition, as is the law in other transactions, that the buyer does not take ownership of the article until he draws it from the domain of the seller into a <i>simta</i>, [an alley adjoining an open place] or until he lifts it [even within the domain of the seller] — or it may be that it is a special Scriptural decree in the case of the sale of a stolen human being, that even if the sale has been finalized between them, and the buyer has taken ownership from the seller by lifting him or by drawing him along in ground which belongs to both of them, [in which case usually the act of drawing the purchased article is a valid act of acquisition even if not done in a <i>simta</i>], that the thief is nonetheless free from the death penalty until the stolen person goes out from his domain into the domain of the buyer. And so indeed it would appear to be [as the latter exposition].<br>Now Rashi in his commentaries there in the Gemara<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">120</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 85b.</i> explained [the phrase of the Beraitha]: “if he sold him but he is still in his possession” as meaning “if he is still <i>in the stolen person’s</i> domain,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">122</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Not as we have explained it heretofore, according to Ramban, that the reference is to <i>the thief’s domain</i>.</i> in which case the thief is free from punishment because there has been no real theft at all.” But if so, nothing new has been established here which is unlike the ordinary law of theft in monetary matters!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">123</sup><i class=\"footnote\">But according to Ramban, as explained above, there is a new law established here: even if the thief brought the stolen person to his domain, and the buyer came there and the sale was completely finalized, [by the buyer lifting him, or drawing him into ground which belongs to both], the thief is nevertheless free from the death penalty as long as the buyer did not remove him from the seller’s domain. In the case of theft of an ox or sheep under such circumstances, the thief would be liable to pay five oxen for an ox and four sheep for a sheep.</i><br>However, it may be, the words of the verse [to be interpreted properly, must be transposed as follows]: “and he that stealeth a man, and he be found in his hand, and he selleth him, he shall surely be put to death.” But it is still possible that the verse may be explained properly in the order it is written in. Thus: <i>And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, and he be found in the hand</i> of the buyer [<i>he</i> — the thief — <i>shall surely be put to death</i>]; for if he stole a human being and brought him to his house, and then he brought the buyer there and sold him without the buyer taking him out from there, the thief is not liable, because the sale has not been completed between them, or even if the sale has been completed, he is still free of the death penalty, as I have written above."

Scripture thus mentioned two kinds of hitting — the hard one, with a stone, and the lighter one, with the fist, which in most cases does not cause death — in order to declare that in both cases an estimate [of the power of the stone or the fist with which he struck him] is needed, and the assailant is meanwhile imprisoned. If the assailed person dies, such as where he struck him a mortal blow, <i>he is a murderer; he shall surely be put to death</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">127</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 35:16.</i> but if he does not die, the assailant has to pay him for the loss of his labor and for the cost of the healing.<br>In the Mechilta [we find the following text]:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">128</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mechilta here on the Verse.</i> “Rabbi Nathan says: He has likened the stone to the fist and the fist to the stone. Just as the stone can cause death, so also the blow of the fist must be such that it is capable of causing death. And just as the fist is something that can be identified [and measured for the power of its blow], so also the stone must be such as can be identified. But if the stone with which he struck him became mixed up with other stones, the assailant is free.” This means if the stone became mixed up with other stones, they [e.i., the judges] estimate the lightest one and if it is incapable of causing death, they free the assailant.<br>Other scholars<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">129</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ibn Ezra and R’dak (in Sefer Hashorashim, root <i>goraf</i>).</i> have said that the word <i>egrof</i> means “a clod of earth,” the term being derived from the expression: <i>the grains shrivel under ‘megr’fotheihem’ (their clods of earth)</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">130</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joel 1:17.</i> and the letter <i>alef</i> [in the word <i>egrof</i> is redundant], as is the <i>alef</i> in the word <i>ezro’a</i> [“arm,” where the word is really <i>zro’a</i>]. And this is the opinion of Onkelos who translated <i>b’egrof — b’churmeiza</i> (a piece of white stone or glazed tile). He mentioned these things also in order to tell us that the assailant who hits him with a clod of earth is also liable to be put to death, if he struck him on a sensitive spot where it is capable of causing death. This is to distinguish the law of the sword from the stone and <i>egrof</i>, for no estimate [of a sword or weapon] needs to be taken [since even a minute piece of metal — such as a needle — can also cause death], as the Sages have mentioned.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">131</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 76b.</i>"

Scripture says <i>and he walketh abroad</i> because it speaks of the customary way of life, for injured men who were laid up in bed do not go out walking again until their wounds have healed and they are out of danger, this being the sense of the phrase, <i>and he walketh abroad</i>, because if he just gets up and walks in his house on his staff, and then dies, the assailant is not free [from the death penalty].<br>In the words of the Mechilta:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">136</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mechilta here on the Verse.</i> “<i>If he rise again and walketh</i>. I might think this means within the house; Scripture therefore says, <i>abroad</i>. But from the word <i>abroad</i> I might think that even if he was wasting away [the assailant is still free from punishment]; Scripture therefore says, <i>if he rise again</i>.” This explanation too is very correct, that Scripture should be saying that if the injured man gets up completely from his bed and goes steadily outside — without having to go back to his bed when returning from outside, as is the way of those who continue to waste away — even though he is weak and has to lean upon a staff, the assailant shall be let off.

It was not necessary for Scripture to state the punishment which he is liable to, but it just stated that he is not to go free merely because the bondman is his money, but <i>he shall surely be punished</i>, as is the punishment of anyone who strikes another person so that he dies, where Scripture has said, <i>he shall surely be put to death</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">141</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 12.</i><br>In line with the plain meaning of Scripture the intention of: <i>Notwithstanding, if a day or two ‘ya’amod’</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">137</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 21.</i> [generally translated “he continues”], is that the bondman literally gets up “and stands” on his feet. This is why it was necessary for Scripture to say <i>a day or two</i>, the meaning thereof being that if on that day or on the following day the bondman will stand up on his feet, <i>he</i> [i.e., the master] <i>shall not be punished</i>. And the verse is to be understood as if it said: “notwithstanding, [if he stands up] <i>‘bayom’</i> or <i>‘bayomayim’</i> (<i>in</i> a day or <i>in</i> two) or <i>‘l’yom’</i> or <i>‘l’yomayim’</i> (<i>to</i> a day or <i>to</i> two).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">142</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse has it: <i>yom o yomayim</i> [literally: “a day or two”]. This fits in with the translation of <i>ya’amod</i> as “he continues,” thus: <i>if he continues</i> [living] <i>a day or two</i>. Ramban who interprets <i>ya’amod</i> in its literal sense — “he stands up” — therefore concludes that the sense of the verse is: “notwithstanding, if <i>he stands up in</i> a day or <i>in</i> two etc.” The opinion of the Rabbis mentioned further on will explain sufficiently why the Torah did write here <i>yom o yomayim</i>.</i> There are many such cases [where the prefix <i>beth</i> or <i>lamed</i> is missing as it is assumed in the meaning of the word]. Thus, at first He had said, <i>and he die under his hand</i>, which might be taken to have meant that the bondman died immediately at the time he struck him; therefore He referred back and explained that if on the day he struck him he stood up on his feet, or even if he could not stand at all on that day, but did so on the next day, the master is free from punishment. But if he did not stand up at all, the master is liable to punishment, even though the bondman only died on the second day, for that too is considered as if he died <i>under his hand</i>. It did not mention a case where he stood up on the third day, for if the bondman lived three days, the master is free from the death penalty, since this is no longer considered a case of <i>he die under his hand</i>.<br>In the opinion of our Rabbis<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">136</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mechilta here on the Verse.</i> Scripture mentioned <i>yom o yomayim</i> [“a day or two,” and not <i>bayom o bayomayim</i>, “in a day or in two”], in order to teach us that [for the master to go free] the bondman must have survived twenty-four hours, and the meaning of the expression used is: “<i>a</i> complete <i>day</i> [consisting, as it does, of twenty-four hours]; <i>or two days</i>, neither of which consists of a complete day, [but instead the period of twenty-four hours is made up of the parts of two separate days].” Had it said just “a day,” the bondman would have had to continue living for a night first and then the following day, as is the “day” of the Torah mentioned at the creation<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">143</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>And there was evening and there was morning, one day</i> (Genesis 1:5).</i> and in connection with the Sabbaths and festivals; [but now that it said, <i>a day or two</i> it means any period of twenty-four hours, as explained above].

And it is correct [to interpret here the letter <i>kaf</i> in the word <i>ka’asher</i> as meaning “when”, and not “as”].

It is known in the tradition of our Rabbis<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">136</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mechilta here on the Verse.</i> that this means monetary compensation. Such usage [of the term <i>tachath</i> to indicate] monetary compensation is found in the verse: <i>And he that smiteth a beast mortally shall pay for it; life ‘tachath’ life</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">152</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 24:18.</i> [in which case <i>tachath</i> surely indicates monetary compensation]. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented that Scripture uses such a term to indicate that he really is deserving of such a punishment, [that his eye be taken from him], if he does not give his ransom. For Scripture has forbidden us to take <i>ransom for the life of a murderer, that is guilty of death</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">153</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 35:31.</i> but we may take ransom from a wicked person who cut off any of the limbs of another person. Therefore we are never to cut off that limb from him, but rather he is to pay monetary compensation, and if he has no money to pay, it lies as a debt on him until he acquires the means to pay, and then he is redeemed.<br>Proof for what the Sages have said [that <i>eye ‘tachath’ eye</i> means he pays him the value of his eye], is in what He has said above [with reference to one who injures another person], <i>only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">154</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 19.</i> But if we were to do to the assailant exactly as he has done to the injured man, why does he have to pay after that? He himself is in need of amends for the loss of his own time and costs of his own healing! And it would not be valid to argue that the assailant is to give the injured man [the difference in cost between a slow recovery and] a fast recovery,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">155</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus, if the assailant had a fast recovery and the injured man a slower recovery, the assailant is to pay him the difference of expenses incurred in the loss of time and costs of healing. In that case, one could still argue that <i>eye ‘tachath’ eye</i> really means that the eye of the assailant be removed, and Verse 19 that deals with his obligation to pay for the loss of time and cost of healing of the injured, applies to that difference as explained above. — This argument is actually mentioned in the Talmud (Baba Kamma 84a.). But, argues Ramban, it is not the plain meaning of Scripture, for the simple meaning of Verse 19 is that it speaks of the assailant having to pay for the <i>whole</i> loss of time and costs of healing. Therefore it constitutes a proof that <i>eye ‘tachath’ eye</i> means monetary compensation, as explained above.</i> since this is not the plain meaning of Scripture. Rather, Scripture speaks of all people, and even if his recovery [i.e., the assailant’s] were to be fast, we would have long taken our punishment of him, in doing to him exactly as he did!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">156</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And why should he be burdened with the additional cost representing the difference in the recoveries [as explained above], after we have already taken our punishment of him by doing to him as he had done to others? Thus it is obvious that Verse 19 speaks of all men alike, and <i>eye ‘tachath’ eye</i> cannot be meant literally, but means the monetary value of the eye.</i><br>If we explain the verses according to the literal interpretation of Scripture, there is no escape from this question,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">157</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., an apparent difficulty in the verses [if we interpret them in their plain meaning]: that in one verse it says <i>eye for an eye</i>, and in the other it speaks of the assailant’s duty to pay for <i>the loss of his time and costs of healing</i>, and the question appears why he should pay this additional payment when we have already punished him. There is no escape from this question except by saying that etc. [see text]. Ramban will finally allude to why he mentions all this: it is to show what sophistry we have to display if we seek to follow only the plain meaning of Scripture!

But if he hits him with a stone or with his fist on his clothes, and he is laid up in bed but then is completely healed without any crippling effect remaining upon his body, in that case He said, <i>only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">154</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 19.</i> All the injuries specified in the verse, <i>burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">160</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 25.</i> are included, according to the plain meaning of Scripture, in this preceding general principle, for a wound and stripe may be completely healed.

He shall make restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft</i>.</i> “This is nothing but a metaphorical expression, [for did the sun rise upon him alone? Does it not rise upon the whole world? It means etc.]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">203</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew text shortens here Rashi’s interpretation, since Ramban’s intention here is not to comment on Rashi’s own explanation, but upon Rashi’s understanding of Onkelos.</i> But Onkelos who rendered the phrase <i>if the sun has risen upon him</i> as: ‘if the eye of the witnesses fell upon him’ chose a different way of interpreting the verse, which is as follows: if the witnesses found the thief before the householder came, and when the householder came to resist the thief, they warned him not to kill the thief, then <i>damim lo</i>, he is liable if he killed him, for since there were witnesses watching him, the thief had no thought of taking human life, and he would not have killed the householder.” Thus is Rashi’s language.<br>But I wonder! When He said above [in Verse 1], <i>there shall be no guilt of blood incurred for him</i>, thereby acquitting the householder for the murder of the thief, it must surely be speaking of a case where the witnesses warned him not to kill him, for no murderer is ever liable to death without prior warning. And if you say then that in stating: <i>there shall be no guilt of blood incurred for him</i>, Heaven permitted the thief’s blood to be shed, that is to say, it is permissible to kill him — that is not true!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">204</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., such an interpretation cannot be the true meaning of <i>this</i> particular verse. For while the law itself is true [that the owner is permitted to kill him], but here the verse speaks of a case where he has already killed him! So how can you say that the intent of the verse is to give him permission to kill him, when he has already killed him! Moreover, since <i>damim lo</i> [in Verse 2] declares the householder culpable both by the court and at the hand of Heaven, then <i>ein lo damim</i> [in the preceeding verse, stating the opposite case], must as a counterpart free him from both, and the way Rashi interpreted Onkelos <i>ein lo damim</i> frees him only from punishment at the hand of Heaven! In other words, Verse 2 must be a case where there were witnesses, as is indicated by the phrase <i>if the sun be risen upon him</i>, as Rashi understands Onkelos. In contrast Verse 1 speaks of a case where there were <i>no</i> witnesses, and hence it cannot refer at all to freeing him from the death by the court, for the court can never act anyway without witnesses; but instead it refers only to freeing him from death by the hand of Heaven. But in that case, the <i>ein lo damim</i> [of Verse 1] and <i>damim lo</i> [of Verse 2] are <i>not</i> in exact contrast: <i>ein lo damim</i> frees him only from punishment by Heaven, and <i>damim lo</i> holds him guilty in both! (Mizrachi). Rather etc.</i> Rather, the first verse acquits the householder under all circumstances from the hand of Heaven, [where he had no prior warning], and from the court if he had prior warning, and the second verse [dealing as it does with another set of circumstances], holds him guilty by the law of both. Perhaps the Rabbi’s intention [i.e., Rashi’s intention in interpreting Onkelos’ translation], was to say that if the witnesses found the thief before the householder came, and recognized him, and the thief knew of their presence, then the thief no longer could have intended to take human life, since he saw that the witnesses recognized him and knew that if he would kill, the witnesses would come to court and have him put to death. And this is the reason for the expression, <i>if the sun has risen upon him</i>, for at night, seeing that the witnesses did not recognize him, he would kill the householder and escape.<br>In my opinion Onkelos intended to say that if the thief has left the break-through, and the householder comes to court to say that he has witnesses that he was found breaking through, <i>damim lo</i> [literally: “he has blood”] as other living people do, and it is not permissible to kill him, and if the householder did kill him, he is to be put to death; but the thief is to pay if he took anything from there. Scripture uses the expression, <i>if the sun be risen upon him</i> because it speaks of the usual manner, for those who break into homes generally do so at night when no one recognizes them, and the one who kills them there is free and may do so with impunity. But if the thief stayed there until the sun had risen upon him, and then left in a stealthy manner and ran for his life, then if the householder comes to bring a charge against him with the help of witnesses, he [i.e., the thief] is not liable to death, neither by the hands of the court nor by the householder. If this is so, then — according to the opinion of the Sage who says<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">205</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The opinion is that of Rav (Sanhedrin 72 a).</i> that a thief who broke into a house and took some of its vessels and went out, is free from paying for them, because he acquired them with “blood”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">206</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Had he been found by the householder while still in the house and he were killed by him, the householder would be free from punishment.</i> — we must say that the second half of the verse which states, <i>he shall make restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft</i>, refers back to a previous verse [i.e., Verse 37 in the preceeding chapter]: <i>if a man steal an ox</i> etc. A similar case is the verse, <i>And also unto thy bondwoman thou shalt do likewise</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">207</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 15:17. This is to be connected with Verse 14 there, which states that the master must present gifts to a manservant who goes out free, and here it states that the same must also be done to a maidservant. But it does not refer to the first half of that verse [17] which speaks of the piercing of the ear of a manservant, since that law does not apply to a woman.</i><br>The plain meaning of the verse is known to be as follows: If a thief dug through into a home at dark, and was found there at night, he may be killed; but if the sun shone upon the thief and someone saw him and recognized him, he may not be killed, but he must pay for what he stole and took from there at daytime. The meaning of the term <i>hashemesh</i> (the sun) is “in the sight of those who saw him.” Similarly, <i>in the sight of this sun</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">208</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Samuel 12:11.</i> means “openly.” The reason for this law is as we have mentioned, that one who comes at night will kill the householder, [and therefore the householder may kill him], whilst one who comes at daytime will flee from him [once he is recognized]."

Moreover, it has been explained in the Gemara<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">221</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Baba Kamma 107a.</i> with convincing proofs, that when he denies the very fact that he ever became a guardian, such as where he says “you have never given me the object to keep,” in that case if he denied it totally, he is free from taking an oath, and if he admitted it partially he is obliged to take an oath, this being the opinion of all Rabbis in the Talmud,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">222</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban is here making an important distinction [in accordance with the teaching of the masters of the Tosafoth — see my Hebrew commentary, p. 430]: If the guardian sets up the kind of defense which can apply to cases of guardianship, such as where he says “an unavoidable accident happened to it” [such a defense has no place naturally where one is sued for a plain debt], then there is no distinction between total and partial admission — he is liable to an oath in either case. But where he puts up the kind of defense which can apply also to a debt, such as where he says, “You have never given me the object to keep” [which can apply to a debt as well: “You have never lent me”], then the law of partial admission applies to a guardian as well as to a debtor: if he denies it totally he is free of an oath, and if he admits it partially he is subject to an oath. — A re-reading of Ramban’s words [“Moreover, etc.”] will yield this thought clearly.</i> even though the Rabbi [Rashi] has not written so in his commentaries to the Gemara.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">221</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Baba Kamma 107a.</i> If so, we may say that the phrase [<i>this is it</i> — from which we derive the principle of partial admission, as explained above], speaks according to the interpretation of the Sages of a case where the guardian’s defense is: “He never gave me anything to keep,” in which case if he denied it totally he is free of an oath, and if he partially admitted it and partially denied it, he is liable to take an oath.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">223</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Such as where the claimant said, “I gave you two vessels to keep,” and he replies, “You gave me one to keep, but the other you never gave to me.” Had the defendant claimed so on both vessels, he would be free of an oath of the Torah. However, if his defense had been that an unavoidable accident happened, even if he claimed so on both of them, he would have had to swear [see preceding Note].</i> Thus the verses are to be explained as follows: <i>If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall come near unto the judges</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">214</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 7.</i> — <i>for every</i> claim <i>of trespass</i> which he may claim against him, such as: “You were negligent in your guarding it,” or where the guardian says: “<i>this is it</i>, — this is what you have deposited with me, and you did not deposit any more with me” — then the one with whom the article was deposited <i>that the judges will condemn</i>, [upon testimony given before them that he embezzled it], <i>shall pay double unto his neighbor</i>. Thus, both [the debtor and the guardian] pay, but double restitution is only where the guardian claims falsely that it was stolen, and the rule concerning the plea of partial admission applies to all claims, even to loans, robbery and other matters. In all these laws the verses of Scripture are few and the rules many. But there is no need to explain them here, except in order to interpret the verses."

Why did Scripture mention specifically here [in the case of the animal being torn to pieces by a wild beast], the necessity of having witnesses, since in this [very same section of the law of the paid guardian] it has already said above, [in the cases where the animal dies, or is hurt, or captured], <i>The oath of the Eternal shall be between them both</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">224</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 10.</i> [i.e., between the owner of the animal and the guardian], and the law in all cases is alike: if there are witnesses that the animal died, or was hurt, or captured, he is free from paying and so also if it was torn in pieces by a wild beast, and if there are no witnesses he must take an oath in all cases, and if he does so, he does not pay?

And since seduction may be achieved in many ways — sometimes with words, sometimes with money, sometimes by falsehood to mislead her, and sometimes even by truth, as when he really wishes to marry her — therefore Onkelos did not use a precise term for it, but rendered it as an expression of “endeavor.” However, in the verse, <i>lest your heart be ‘yifteh,’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">230</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 11:16.</i> he used the other meaning and translated it: <i>‘dilma yit’ei,’</i> for there it means, “perhaps you will be misled.”<br>And that which the Rabbi [Rashi] explained: “‘<i>Mahor yimharenah’ (he shall surely pay a dowry for her) to be his wife</i> — he shall assign her a marriage portion as is the manner of a man to his wife, by writing her a <i>kethubah</i> (marriage contract)” — this is not correct, for if the seducer marries her, he pays no penalty,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">252</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 16, and Kethuboth 39a.</i> and if he divorces her after the marriage, there is no monetary obligation upon him by law of the Torah, since a <i>kethubah</i> is a matter of Rabbinic ordinance. Rather, <i>mohar</i> means gifts — the gifts which a man sends to his betrothed, <i>jewels of silver and jewels of gold</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">253</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 24:53.</i> and clothes for the wedding ceremony and marriage, these being called <i>sivlonoth</i> in the language of the Rabbis.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">254</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kiddushin 50a.</i> Thus they said: “<i>Mohari</i> go back [upon the death of the wife].”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">255</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Baba Bathra 145a. This applies to a case where the marriage was not consumated (Even Ha’ezer 50, 4).</i> And Onkelos rendered the verse, <i>And Shechem said… Multiply upon me greatly ‘mohar’ and gift</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">256</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 34:12.</i> — “multiply upon me greatly <i>moharin</i> [in the plural] and gifts,” and Shechem would not have vowed to write Dinah many <i>kethuboth</i>. Instead, <i>mohar</i> means gifts, as I have explained. It is possible that the word is derived from the expression <i>‘m’heirah chushah’ (hasten, stay not)</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">257</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 20:38.</i> because the <i>mohar</i> is the first thing which hastens the wedding, as the groom hurries and sends these presents ahead of him in eager haste and then he comes to his father-in-law’s house to make the wedding or the feast, just as the Sages have spoken of “parties of <i>sivlonoth</i>” (when presents are presented to the betrothed).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">258</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Pesachim 49a.</i> The meaning of <i>‘mahor yimharenah’ to be his wife</i> is then, that the seducer should send her presents and necessities for the wedding in order to become his wife. There is thus a hint here that both the seducer and the seduced can prevent the marriage, since Scripture uses such language rather than saying expressly that he should take her to him as his wife; for there is no commandment upon him to marry her unless he so desires, and if he does not want her to begin with, he is to pay fifty shekels of silver.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">259</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 22:29. As explained further on in Ramban, this fine [stated in the case of a violator] applies also to a seducer — if he or she refuses marriage.</i> After that Scripture states<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">260</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 16 here.</i> that if the father <i>refuses to give her unto him, he shall pay</i> him <i>money according to the ‘mohar’</i> which men give <i>to virgins</i> whom they marry. The reason for this fine is that the seducer has spoiled her reputation in the eyes of young men, thus the father will have to give her many presents and they will not give her any dowry, therefore it is right that the seducer should pay it. Our Rabbis have said<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">261</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mechilta here in the verse, and Kethuboth 10a.</i> that the amount of this <i>mohar</i> was determined by Scripture in the case of the violator to be fifty shekels of silver,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">262</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 22:29.</i> the law of the violator and of the seducer being alike in this respect. Scripture, however, did differentiate between them in that in the case of the violator it says, <i>and she shall be his wife… he may not put her away all his days</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">262</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 22:29.</i> the reason [for this distinction between the violator, who must marry the maiden whom he has raped, and is forbidden to divorce her ever, and the seducer, who does not have to marry the seduced girl, but may instead pay the penalty mentioned in the Torah], is that usually it is <i>handsome young men</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">263</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 23:6.</i> who seduce virgins, and the beautiful daughters of prominent families, [in the hope of marrying them]. But since it is not proper that he should gain from his sin, [i.e., that the girl should have to marry the seducer], therefore He explained that he cannot marry her against their will [hers and that of her father], but instead must pay them. Also, because she too sinned in this matter, He did not impose it on him to have to marry her against his will, but instead it is enough if he pays the penalty [of the fifty shekels of silver], and if he marries her with her consent and that of her father, she has the same status in relation to him as all women, having no claim to a <i>kethubah</i> from him by law of the Torah [but only by Rabbinic ordinance]. Similarly, it is usually the sons of prominent families who rape the daughters of those less-known families who have no power against them. Therefore He said in the case of the violator, <i>and she shall be his wife</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">262</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 22:29.</i> — against his will. And in the opinion of our Rabbis,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">264</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kethuboth 39b.</i> there too [in the case of the violator] the maiden and her father can withhold consent, as it would not be correct that he should marry her against her will, and thus do her two evils. Sometimes she may be of a more honorable family than he, and it is inconceivable that she should be further disgraced by his sinful act. The fair law is thus that the decision as to the marriage of the raped maiden be left to her discretion and that of her father, and not to the violator; instead, [if she desires it] he must marry her against his will,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">265</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Even if she be lame, even if she be blind, and even if she is afflicted with boils” (<i>ibid.</i>, 39 a).</i> in order that violent men should not take liberties with the daughters of Israel.<br>Now this law of seduction only applies to a <i>na’arah</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">266</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A <i>na’arah</i> is a maiden between the age of twelve years and a day and twelve and a half. After that she counts as a <i>bogereth</i> — past her maidenhood. The period of <i>yalduth</i> (childhood) is from three years and a day to twelve years and a day.</i> as does the law of violation [which applies only to a girl between the ages of twelve years and a day, and twelve and a half], for there Scripture expressly stated, <i>if a man find a ‘n’arah’ that is a virgin</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">267</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 22:28.</i> but here He did not mention <i>na’arah</i>. The reason for this is that the term <i>na’arah</i> mentioned there [in the case of a violator], is used in order to exclude the <i>bogereth</i> [a woman who has passed the stage of maidenhood], who is considered an adult woman, whereas a girl who is a minor [between the ages of three years and a day and twelve years and a day], is also included under the terms of the law of violation. But here [in the case of seduction], it was not necessary to exclude a <i>bogereth</i>, for it is self-understood that one who seduces a <i>bogereth</i> pays nothing, as he did it with her mature consent. Besides, a father has no rights at all in his daughter after the days of her maidenhood, as it is written, <i>‘bin’ureihah’ (in her maidenhood) in her father’s house</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">268</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 30:17.</i> and here He said, <i>If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">260</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 16 here.</i> thus indicating that he [the father] can give her to him as a wife, seeing that he has the authority to take her betrothal-money, and this applies only when she is a minor or a <i>na’arah</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">266</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A <i>na’arah</i> is a maiden between the age of twelve years and a day and twelve and a half.

Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented that in accordance with the plain meaning of Scripture, this command is not directed to Israel, as they had already been warned in the second of the Ten Commandments against the worship of idols. Instead it was said to “the stranger” mentioned in the following verse, that he may live in our land only on condition that he should not sacrifice to his gods as he was wont to do. — But <i>he</i> [i.e., Ibn Ezra] <i>openeth his mouth in vanity</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">281</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 35:16.

See Ramban there for full explanation.

But it is possible that the word <i>ki</i> [generally translated “for”], here means “if,” for this is one of the usages of the word <i>ki</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">309</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rosh Hashanah 3a. The verse here reads: <i>ki im tza’ok yitzak</i>, and is generally translated: “<i>for</i> if he cry.” But with the word <i>ki</i> understood as “if”, the verse would read: “if if he cry,” as explained further on in the text.</i> and the verse thus states: “if if he cry at all unto Me, I will surely hear his cry,” the repetition of the word “if” being used in order to show the gravity and importance of the matter, similar in usage to these phrases; <i>hamiblie ein k’varim</i> [generally translated: “Was it because there were no graves…?” — but literally: “was it because there were ‘no no’ graves…?”];<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">310</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 14:11.</i> <i>harak ach b’Mosheh</i> [generally translated: “hath the Eternal indeed spoken only with Moses”, but literally: “‘only only’ with Moses].”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">311</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 12:2.</i><br>The correct interpretation appears to me to be that He is stating: “<i>If thou afflict him in any wise, if he will</i> only just <i>cry at all unto Me I will</i> at once <i>hear his cry:</i> he does not need anything else at all, for I will save him and avenge his cause from you. And the reason for this is that you oppress him because [you think] he has no one to help him against you, but behold he has more help than anyone else. For other people will try to find saviors to save them, and helpers to avenge their cause, and perhaps <i>they cannot profit nor deliver</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">312</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 12:21.</i> while this one will be saved by the Eternal merely through his crying out, and He will take vengeance from you, for <i>The Eternal is a jealous and avenging G-d</i>.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">313</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nachum 1:2.</i> There are many verses to a similar effect. Thus, that which He said, <i>Rob not the weak, because he is weak, neither crush the poor in the gate; for the Eternal will plead their cause</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">314</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 22:22-23.</i> means: “rob not the poor merely because he is poor and has no helpers, nor crush the poor in your gates, for the Eternal will plead on their behalf.” Similarly He said, <i>And enter not into the fields of the fatherless, for their Redeemer is strong;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">315</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 23:10-11.</i> <i>the Eternal of hosts is His Name</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">316</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 50:34: <i>Their Redeemer is strong, the Eternal of hosts is His Name</i>.</i> for they have a Redeemer Who is stronger and closer to them than all people have. Here also He said, that just by his cry, the fatherless will be saved. Likewise: <i>For as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, except it water the earth, and make it bring forth and bud, and give seed to the sower and bread to the eater; so shall My word be that goeth forth out of My mouth; it shall not return unto Me void, except it accomplish that which I please</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">317</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 55:10-11.</i> In both phrases [<i>except it water — except it accomplish</i>] He is stating that they<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">318</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the rain and the snow.</i> will do nothing else other than to water the earth immediately, and so also will <i>My word</i> do that which I please. Thus the meaning of the word <i>ki</i> [<i>ki im hirvah — ki im asah</i>: except it water — except it accomplish] has the sense of “but.” And so also: <i>‘ki im’ (but) I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">319</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 10:30.</i>"

According to Onkelos the verse thus refers to the first-fruits and the heave-offering.</i> And Rashi explained: “<i>M’leiathcha</i> — this means the duty which falls upon you when your crop becomes fully ripened, and it refers to the first-fruits. <i>V’dim’acha</i> means the heave-offering. But I do not know what the term <i>dim’a</i> means.” It is similarly stated in the Mechilta:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">348</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mechilta here on the Verse.</i> “<i>M’leiathcha</i> means the first-fruits which are taken from the full crop, and <i>dim’acha</i> means the heave-offering.” Perhaps in the same way that according to the Rabbis the first-fruits are called in this verse <i>m’leiah</i> (fulness), because they are taken from the full crop, so the heave-offering is called <i>dim’ah</i> [literally: “tear” or “outflow,” as explained above], because it is set aside from wine and oil, [as liquids], not from the fruit. Scripture mentioned only these two kinds of produce, [wine and oil], in order to hint at the law that the heave-offering only has to be set aside from them when in the form of wine and oil, there being no obligation upon the owner to anticipate and set it aside when they are still grapes and olives.<br>Thus He only mentioned these commandments here by way of allusion, as if to say, “Be careful to keep these commandments about which I will command you further,” in a similar manner to that which He said above, <i>and I will appoint thee a place whither he may flee</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">353</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 21:13.</i> This was in order to write down these commandments in <i>the book of the covenant</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">354</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 24:7.</i> which He mentions in a subsequent section, and Scripture explains them all again in another place, [each one in detail]."

In the Mechilta the Sages differed as to the explanation of this verse and interpreted it in many ways.<br>In accordance with the plain meaning of Scripture, the explanation of the verse is: “<i>and in all things that I have said unto you</i> concerning other gods <i>take ye heed</i>,” for the verse is to be connected with its continuation, [which states: <i>and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth</i>]. Thus He is stating: Of all the many admonitions that I have said to you concerning other gods, take great heed; do not worship them, nor bow down to them, condemn to death anyone who sacrifices to them, and make no graven image, nor any manner of likeness. Moreover, take heed not to mention the name of their gods, such as <i>Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milkom the god of the children of Ammon</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">371</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Kings 11:33.</i> and Ashima the god of Hamath.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">372</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Kings 17:30.</i> <i>Neither let there be heard out of thy mouth</i> their name, even without the epithet of deity, such as merely mentioning Milkom or Ashima; instead you are to mention them in a manner of condemnation: “the abhorrent thing of Moab,” “the abomination of the children of Ammon.” Or, the expression <i>lo yishama (neither let there be heard)</i>, means: let it not be heard from its worshipper through your dealings with him, similarly to that which our Rabbis have said,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">373</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 63b.</i> that one should not make a business—partnership with an idolator, for it might lead to him swearing by his deity.<br>It is possible that <i>lo tazkiru (make no mention)</i> is transitive, meaning: do not mention the name of other gods to their worshippers, such as saying, “By your god! deal kindly with me.” <i>Neither let there be heard out of thy mouth</i> the mention of his name at all.

I do not know why Scripture mentions the names of the festivals with the definite article since He has not yet commanded about or mentioned them at all till now, and it ought to have said first: “and you shall keep a feast of harvest, the first-fruits of your labors,” just as He said in the Book of Deuteronomy, <i>And thou shalt keep a festival of weeks unto the Eternal thy G-d</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">375</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 16:9.</i> But perhaps because He had already said, <i>Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto Me in the year</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">376</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 14 here.</i> and further explained, <i>The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep… in the mouth of Aviv</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">377</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 15. — <i>Aviv</i> [literally: “maturity”] means the month when the grain becomes full in its ripe state (Rashi).

Now all these festivals are thus named with reference to man’s activities in the field, in order that he give thanks for them to G-d who guards <i>the ordinances of heaven</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">378</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 33:25.</i> and brings forth bread out of the earth<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">379</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Psalms 104:14.</i> to satisfy <i>the longing soul, and the hungry soul He hath filled with good</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">380</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 107:9.</i> This is Scripture’s intention in using here the expression: <i>el pnei Ha’adon Hashem (three times in the year shall all thy males appear — ‘before the Master, the Eternal’)</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">381</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 17 here.</i> for He is the Master who provides the needs of His servants, and when they take their part from before Him, they come to Him to see what He commands them to do. Thus the expression <i>el pnei</i> is like <i>‘liphnei’</i> (“before”) — <i>before the Master</i>. But by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], the word <i>pnei</i> is derived from the term <i>panim</i> [literally: “face”], and I have already alluded to the explanation of <i>panim</i> in the Ten Commandments.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">382</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 20:3.</i> This is why He said <i>Ha’adon Hashem (the Master, the Eternal)</i>, just as He said the second time, <i>the Master, the Eternal, the G-d of Israel</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">383</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 34:23. — Ramban’s intention is to suggest that <i>el pnei Ha’adon</i> here is not in the grammatical form of construct with the word <i>Hashem;</i> this is evident from the same expression which occurs a second time [in 34:23] where it is written <i>Hashem Elokei Yisrael</i>, thus indicating that here too the word <i>Hashem</i> is not in construct with <i>Ha’adon</i> (Abusaula).</i> Similarly: <i>Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Master of all the earth;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">384</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 3:11.</i> <i>Tremble, thou earth, ‘miliphnei’ (at the presence) of the Master</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">385</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 114:7.

To this Rava answered that we derive it from the verse, <i>Thou shalt not slaughter…</i> (further 34:25), which means: “do not slaughter the Paschal-lamb while the leavened bread is still there.” And since the time for the slaughtering of the Paschal-lamb begins after the sixth hour, we therefore deduce that unleavened bread is forbidden from that time on. When the Gemara further asked: “Perhaps the Torah meant a separate time for each individual, [so that if he slaughtered it on the ninth hour of the day, he would not be in violation of the law against keeping unleavened bread till such time]? To this the answer is given: “The Merciful One has declared a time for the slaughtering of the Passover-offering [for all alike, and He did not distinguish between one person and another]. — Ramban is now writing that Rashi’s explanation was <i>not</i> prompted by this text of the Gemara, for reasons explained further on.</i> “The Merciful One has declared a time for the slaughtering of the Passover-offering for all alike” — for this interpretation is not the real point of the verse in accordance with the final decision of the law mentioned there. For there is no <i>prohibition</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">387</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban’s point is that the duty of removing from one’s possession unleavened bread on the fourteenth day of Nisan, is a matter of a <i>positive</i> commandment, thus one who failed to remove it from his possession after the sixth hour of that day, has thereby violated a <i>positive</i> commandment. But there is no <i>negative</i> commandment to cover this matter. Hence the verse before us which is a <i>negative</i> commandment cannot be establishing the time for the removal of unleavened bread, since that is covered only by a positive commandment. This is the intention of Ramban’s words.</i> according to the law of the Torah requiring the removal of unleavened bread on the day before Passover, not even is there a prohibition against eating it [but the violation of a <i>positive</i> commandment].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">388</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here too Ramban’s opinion is that there is no <i>negative</i> commandment of the Torah covering it, but one who eats it violates thereby a <i>positive</i> commandment, since he had failed to destroy the unleavened bread beforehand. See, however, “the Commandments,” Vol. II, p. 196, where Rambam differs on this point and counts a specific negative commandment, wherein we are forbidden to eat unleavened bread after the middle of the fourteenth of Nisan.</i> But the subject of the verse as established according to the final decision of the law, is an admonition against slaughtering the Passover-offering <i>with leavened bread</i>, meaning that none of the company who have been counted to eat of this Passover-offering, may have leavened bread remaining in their possession at the time it is slaughtered. And so Rashi explained it in the section of <i>Ki Thisa</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">389</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 34:25. “This is an admonition addressed to him who slaughters the offering, as well as to him who sprinkles its blood [on the altar], or to one of the company [that joined together to eat the Paschal-lamb]” (Rashi).</i> Now the verse should have read, “Thou shalt not slaughter with unleavened bread My sacrifice” [omitting the word: <i>dam</i> — blood], for the blood is not “slaughtered.” But in the opinion of our Rabbis<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">390</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mechilta here on the Verse.</i> this comes to include the sprinkling, so that the priest who sprinkles the blood of the offering is also forbidden to have leavened bread in his possession. The verse thus states: “Do not slaughter the Passover-offering with unleavened bread, and neither [sprinkle] the blood of My sacrifice,” That is, and neither let the blood of My sacrifice be with unleavened bread. It is an elliptical verse."

And to this one [i.e., Rabbi Yosei the son of Rabbi Yehudah] we listen, since he has spoken according to the accepted opinion.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">486</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Peah 4:1 for origin of this expression [“to this one we listen etc.”].</i>",
                    "<i>And unto Moses He said</i>. The reason for this kind of expression [when it should have said, as elsewhere, <i>And the Eternal spoke unto Moses</i>], is that up till now the commandments and the ordinances were addressed to the children of Israel, therefore Scripture said here that this particular commandment was given to Moses, that he alone should do it; thus He commanded him: “After you have set before them the commandments and the ordinances, and have made with them the covenant, come up to Me.” This was why Moses fulfilled the first command [i.e., of telling the people the section beginning with <i>Ye yourselves have seen</i> — above 20:19 — up to <i>for they will be a snare unto thee</i> — 23:33], on the sixth day of Sivan, [following the Revelation which took place on that morning], and on the seventh he rose up early in the morning and made with them the covenant, and after that he went up into the mountain, he and those that were asked to come,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">487</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel (Verse 1).</i> as they were commanded.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">488</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., just as at the time of the Giving of the Torah Moses had a place designated for himself, Aaron a place designated for himself, and the people a place designated for themselves (see Ramban above 19:19), so here too Moses approached closer than Aaron, etc.</i>",
                    "<i>Come up to the Eternal</i>. In line with the simple meaning of Scripture, the reason for this expression [when it should have said: “Come up unto Me”], is because it is the Scriptural style to mention the proper name instead of the pronoun, such as: <i>And Lemech said… Ye wives of Lemech;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">489</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 4:23.

For just as it is said there, <i>And the glory of the Eternal abode upon Mount Sinai</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 24:16.</i> and it is further written, <i>Behold, the Eternal our G-d hath shown us His glory and His greatness</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 5:21.</i> so it is written of the Tabernacle, <i>and the glory of the Eternal filled the Tabernacle</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 40:34.</i> Twice is this verse, <i>and the glory of the Eternal filled the Tabernacle</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 40:34.</i> mentioned in connection with the Tabernacle,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, and in Verse 35.</i> to correspond with <i>His glory and His greatness</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 5:21.</i> Thus Israel always had with them in the Tabernacle the Glory which appeared to them on Mount Sinai.

Some scholars<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I have not been able to identify these scholars.</i> say that this is an elliptical verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These scholars are of the opinion that <i>b’samim</i> (spices) and <i>hasamim</i> (aromatics) are two different terms. And since it says further on that for the incense <i>take unto thee ‘samim’ (aromatics)</i> (30:34), the word <i>b’samim</i> cannot refer also to the incense mentioned here. Hence they complete the sentence thus: “spices for anointing oil, <i>and aromatics</i> for incense and aromatics.”</i> the sense being: “spices for anointing oil and aromatics for incense of aromatics.” And other scholars<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mentioned in Ibn Ezra in the name of “contemporary scholars.” I found this in Chizkuni.</i> say that the verse is to be understood as if it were inverted: “and for incense of aromatics they shall bring aromatics.” Scripture mentions them with the definite article [<i>hasamim</i>], in order to indicate that it is referring to those aromatics that are good as incense, for there also [i.e., further in the section of the Torah dealing with the incense — 30:34] He did not explain [fully the compound forming the incense].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hence He referred to them here by the definite article — <i>hasamim</i> — the aromatics that are known. See Ramban further 30:34 for full discussion of this subject.</i> And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote that the verse is to be taken in its simple sense, that spices be taken for both — for the anointing oil and for the incense, for included in the compound of the incense were these spices: spikenard and saffron and cinnamon, according to the words of our Rabbis.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kerithoth 6a.</i> It was not necessary for Scripture to mention “spices and aromatics for the incense,” because it said <i>the incense of aromatics</i>, just as it did not say “oil for the anointing oil.” This is the correct interpretation.<br>All these opinions are necessary because according to the view of the linguists [<i>samim</i> and <i>b’samim</i> connote two different things]: <i>samim</i> are curative herbs which are not edible, such as frankincense and galbanum,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 30:34.</i> while <i>b’samim</i> are those that are edible, and are called <i>mis’adim</i> (props)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This was a Medieval medicinal term for spices which were given to the sick to restore their vigor. See Hebrew dictionaries, under the term <i>mis’ad</i>.</i> because they have a strengthening power by their fragrant odor.<br>However, in the opinion of Rashi <i>samim</i> is identical with <i>b’samim</i>. And such is the meaning of our Rabbis in the Midrash<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shir Hashirim Rabbah 1:61.</i> in saying: “Eleven <i>samonin</i> (ingredients) were told to Moses on Mount Sinai” [which form the incense, and among them were spikenard and saffron and cinnamon which are <i>b’samim</i>, thus proving that they are all called by the term <i>samim</i>]. Onkelos also translates in both cases <i>busmin</i> [“<i>busmaya</i> for the anointing oil, and for incense of <i>busmaya</i>”]. This is correct in the understanding of this verse. But because Scripture changed the terms [calling one <i>b’samim</i> and the other <i>samim</i>] we might possibly say that the most important of aromatics and spices are called <i>b’samim</i>, a term which signifies the choicest and most famous of the spices, just as He said, <i>‘b’samim rosh’ (the chief spices)</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 30:23.</i> <i>‘b’rosh kol bosem’ (with chief of all spieces)</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 27:22.</i> We are also correct in saying that the words <i>b’samim</i> and <i>bosem</i> are composite words: <i>bo sem, bo samim</i> (“in it is spice,” “in it are spices”). Proof to the words of the Rabbis [that the term <i>b’samim</i> includes also <i>samim</i>] is the verse, <i>Take thou unto thee ‘b’samim rosh’ (the chief spices) of flowing myrrh</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 30:23.</i> and myrrh, is counted among the <i>samim</i> since it is a curative, not an edible herb. Scripture further says, <i>Spikenard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Song of Songs 4:14.</i> and the verse there continues: <i>myrrh and aloes, with all the chief ‘b’samim’ (spices)</i>. And with reference to all of these Scripture says, <i>Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that ‘b’samov’ (the spices thereof) may flow out</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 16. Thus it is clear that the term <i>b’samim</i> (spices) includes also <i>samim</i> (aromatics), since it speaks of all of them as <i>b’samim</i> and lists amongst them myrrh, which is one of the <i>samim</i>.</i> A further proof [to the opinion of the Rabbis that <i>b’samim</i> includes also <i>samim</i>] is the verse, <i>and the princes brought… the ‘bosem’ and the oil for the light and for the annointing oil and the incense of aromatics</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 35:28.</i> but it does not mention that they brought <i>samim</i>, from which we may conclude that they are all included in the <i>bosem</i>."

                    "AVNEI SHOHAM’ (ONYX STONES) ‘V’AVNEI MILU’IM’ (AND STONES FOR SETTING). “Because they used to make a setting for the stone in gold — a kind of indentation — and they placed the stone there to fill the indentation, they are called <i>avnei milu’im</i> (stones for filling-in), and the place of the indentation is called <i>mishbetzet</i> (setting). FOR THE EPHOD AND THE BREASTPLATE. The onyx stones were for the <i>ephod</i>, and the stones for setting were for the breastplate.” This is Rashi’s language. Similarly Rashi explained: “<i>They shall be inclosed in gold in their settings</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 28:20.</i> — surrounded by gold settings of such a depth that each setting shall be filled by the thickness of the stone. This is the meaning of the word <i>milu’otham</i> (their filling),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 28:20.</i> and this is the meaning of every expression of <i>milui</i> (filling) mentioned in this connection.”<br>But it does not appear to me to be at all correct to say that Scripture calls them already now <i>avnei milu’im</i>, because in some time as yet in the future He was to command that the indentations made for them were to be filled with these stones! Moreover, the onyx stones were also <i>enclosed in settings of gold</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 11 — in the case of the ephod.</i> and yet He did not call them <i>milu’im</i>. Again, our Rabbis have already said in the Gemara:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sotah 48b.</i> “These stones<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The onyx stones for the ephod, and the stones for setting in the breastplate. Ramban will later suggest that the reference perhaps is only to the stones for setting in the breastplate. See further, Note 76.</i> are not incised with a chisel,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For the purpose of writing the names of the tribes upon the stones (further, 28:12, and 21).</i> for it is said <i>b’milu’otham</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 28:20.</i> (in their filling).” Now if the explanation <i>b’milu’otham</i> would be, [as Rashi has it], that they fill the indentations with the stones, there would have been no proof at all from this verse that they should not incise the names [of the tribes] on them with a chisel. Besides, the manner of the setting of the stones which the Rabbi [Rashi] mentioned, namely that it was made in a kind of indentation, is not correct. Instead, it is as Onkelos rendered it: [<i>meshubatzim zahav</i> — inclosed in gold] <i>meramtzan didhav</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 28:20.</i> which means that they made at the bottom a gold setting according to the measure of the stone, and from it they projected a fork-like shape of three prongs which would hold the stone. [The word <i>meramtzan</i> mentioned by Onkelos] is similar to the expressions of the Sages: “and they take it out <i>beramtza</i> (with a pointed tool) made of iron;”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Niddah 62a.</i> “as when he bored a hole in it <i>beramtza</i> (with a pick) made of iron.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">64</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shabbath 103a.</i> This is how they also do it today when they set precious stones in rings, in order that they be seen from all angles and that their beauty and splendor should not be hidden in the indentations. You may know that this is so, for the two gold chains inserted in the two rings of the breastplate were attached to the <i>mishb’tzoth</i> on the shoulder-pieces of the <i>ephod</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 28:24-25.</i> Now if <i>mishb’tzoth</i> were [as Rashi said] frames for the setting of the stone, how would they attach to them the chains? And even [if there were there other <i>mishb’tzoth</i> not for the setting of the stone but for the purpose of inserting the chains] how would the indentations serve that purpose [as they were not perforated for the chains to go through]? Rather, the <i>mishb’tzoth</i> are the fork-like prongs as we have said and the holes for the chains were made in them. Associated with the word <i>mishb’tzoth</i> is, in my opinion, [Saul’s expression, <i>Slay me</i>] <i>for ‘hashabatz’ hath taken hold of me</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Samuel 1:9.</i> these being the men who hold spear-like weapons with mounted forks on top to catch those that flee the battle-field, just as it is said, <i>and lo, the chariots and the horsemen pressed hard upon him</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">67</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 6.</i><br>And the meaning of <i>musaboth mishb’tzoth</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 28:11.</i> is that he should fix the gold prongs “around it.” And in the opinion of Onkelos who translated [<i>musaboth</i> as] <i>meshak’on</i> [literally: “depressed,” “sunk”], the stones were sunk into the frames from which came forth prongs surrounding them above and holding them in place.<br>But the sense of the word <i>milu’im</i> is that the stones be whole as they were created, and that they should not be hewn stones which were cut from a large quarry, or from which anything has been chipped off. It is also known in the natural sciences that the complete powers of precious stones and the particular qualities that distinguish them, exist only when in their natural state, as when smooth stones are taken from the river. This is why Onkelos translated [<i>avnei milu’im — avnei</i>] <i>ashlamutha</i> (stones of perfection). But the term <i>milui</i> (filling of) vessels or an indentation [Onkelos] translates literally, — thus: <i><b>'va’t'malei'</b> (and she filled) her pitcher</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 24:16.</i> Onkelos translated: <i><b>u’mleiah</b></i> (and she filled), and similarly in all other cases — but here he translated the term <i>milui</i> to mean <i>shleimuth</i> (perfection). Similarly, he translated the verse, <i>‘milei’ (He filled) them with wisdom of heart</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 35:35.</i> — <i>ashleim</i> (“He perfected” them with wisdom of heart), as wisdom is not something that you can fill a vessel with, but instead it denotes perfection, that they [i.e. Bezalel and Oholiab — who did the workmanship of the Tabernacle] were perfect in wisdom. This is the intent of the verse, <i>and in cutting of stones <b>'l’maloth'</b></i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 31:5.</i> — that they knew how to engrave like the engravings of a signet upon stones in their [natural] perfect state.<br>Now in the case of the stones of the ephod it is said, however, <i>with the work of an engraver in stone, like the engravings of a signet, shalt thou engrave the two stones, according to the names of the children of Israel</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 11 — in the case of the ephod.</i> [but it does not say here <i>b’milu’otham</i> — “in their perfect state”], because they made an incision in them when writing the names [of the tribes upon them] as stone engravers do, and thus the stones were no longer in their [natural] perfect state. But in the case of the stones for the breastplate it is written, <i>‘umileitha’ in it ‘miluath’ of stone</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">72</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 28:17.</i> and again it is written of them, <i>they shall be ‘b’milu’otham;’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">73</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 20.</i> <i>and the stones</i> [of the breastplate] <i>were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">74</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 38:14.</i> — not the work of engravers [who make incisions upon the stones]. Therefore Moses our teacher could find no way [of inscribing the names of the tribes of Israel upon the twelve stones in the breastplate] except by means of the <i>shamir</i> [a worm that cuts stones with its glance] which our Rabbis mentioned, just as they have said in Tractate Sotah:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">75</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sotah 48b.</i> “These stones<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">76</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e. the stones of the breastplate. See above Note 61.</i> are not written upon with ink, for it is said, <i>like the engravings of a signet</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">77</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 28:21. “And this means carving” (Rashi, <i>ibid.</i>, Sotah). — The verse is mentioned in connection with the stones of the breastplate.</i> and they are not incised with a chisel, for it is said <i>b’milu’otham</i> (in their perfect state).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">78</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 20. — Also in connection with the stones of the breastplate.</i> But instead [Moses] brought the <i>shamir</i> and showed it the stones and they split of their own accord.” Now the word <i>b’milu’otham</i> is said only in connection with the stones of the breastplate. Do not be troubled by what is mentioned in the Agadah (homily, tradition) that the Rabbis said to Solomon:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">79</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gittin 68a. In preparing to build the Sanctuary, Solomon asked the Rabbis: “How shall I accomplish the cutting of the stones without using iron tools?” They replied: “There is the <i>shamir</i> etc.”</i> “There is the <i>shamir</i> with which Moses cut the precious stones of the <i>ephod</i>.” [From this you might argue that the stones of the <i>ephod</i> also had to be <i>b’milu’otham</i> — in their perfect natural state — which would be contrary to what we have said above, that this applied only to the stones of the breastplate! Do not be troubled by this statement,] for the breastplate is called ephod by the Rabbis by way of metaphor, because the breastplate is attached thereto. It is also written, <i>Bring hither the ephod</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">80</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 23:9.</i> and it was of the breastplate that they asked [for guidance].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">81</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ramban further, 28:30.</i> Thus the explanation of the verse before us is as follows: “<i>onyx stones</i> three — two for the ephod<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">82</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 28:9.</i> and one for the breastplate;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">83</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 20.</i> and <i>stones of ‘milu’im’</i> for the breastplate.” And in case the opinion of our Rabbis was that the stones of the ephod also had to be in their full natural state [as the stones of the breastplate], then both <i>the onyx stones and the stones of ‘milu’im’</i> were for both, <i>for the ephod and for the breastplate</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">84</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, if that be the opinion of the Rabbis that the stones of the ephod also had to be <i>b’milu’otham</i> (in their full natural state), then they derived it from this verse as explained in the text. For — the ephod and the breastplate — had both the onyx stones and the stones of <i>milu’im</i>. Of the ephod it is clearly written that it had two onyx stones (further, 28:9), and according to the Rabbis these were also <i>b’milu’otham</i> (in their full natural state). In the case of the breastplate <i>b’milu’otham</i> is clearly mentioned (<i>ibid.</i>, Verse 20) and so is the onyx stone (<i>ibid.</i>). Thus the verse before us, <i>stones of onyx and stones of ‘milu’im’</i> means that both were <i>for the ephod and for the breastplate</i>.</i>"

These are the very four rings which are mentioned at the beginning of the verse, but here Scripture explains that two of these rings were placed on one side [and the other two on the other side].” Thus did Rashi explain, and he explained it well. But I do not know why Rashi wrote that “on the upper corners near to the cover” the rings were placed. For in that case, the weight [of the ark and the tables of law hanging down from the staves] would be very much heavier.

Principally Ramban differs with three points that Ibn Ezra made: 1. That there were eight rings to the ark; 2. that the staves for carrying the ark were inserted in the <i>upper</i> rings; 3. that the ark had feet. — It is on this second point that the texts differ. It must then be remembered that Ramban is directing his criticism on Ibn Ezra holding that it was the <i>upper</i> rings that were for carriage. Ramban’s opinion is that the lower rings were for the insertion of the staves with which the ark was carried. Ramban will also differ with Ibn Ezra on the other two points.</i> being those through which the staves were inserted to carry the ark with, whilst the four upper rings were purely for ornamental purposes. His words are, however, not at all correct. For if, as he said, <i>pa’am</i> means foot, then Scripture is commanding that the rings should be in the lower corners upon which the ark rests, and these bottom corners are called “feet” because the Sacred Language adapts all forms according to the image of man. Thus it calls the upper part of any object <i>rosh</i> (head), and the bottom part <i>regel</i> (foot). [Accordingly there is no need to say as did Ibn Ezra that the ark had feet to it upon which it rested, since Scripture calls the bottom corners “feet.”] And this is indeed true, that the rings for the purpose of carriage were at the bottom corners, and the ark was thus lifted up above the staves, as I have explained above.<br>But in my opinion <i>pa’am</i> does not mean “foot” but is a term meaning “step.” <i>How beautiful are ‘p’amayich’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">103</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Song of Songs 7:2.

For, assuming that the length of the ark was placed in an east-west position, then there were two rings on its north side, one at the eastern head and one at the western, and likewise two rings on the south side of the ark [similarly placed], and the steps of the priests moved between the rings with their faces towards one another.

Into this mould the dough was put, measured and shaped to fit its form, and for this reason it was called <i>mechila</i> because it was made to “the measure.” The term <i>menakiyoth</i> then [according to Onkelos] is a name just like ephah and <i>s’ah</i> [a third of the ephah measure is a <i>s’ah</i>], similar, to <i>ke’arothav</i> and <i>ksothav</i> and other nouns which are not descriptive.

And <i>ksavoth</i> is a general term covering the canes [which were put between one loaf and another] and the trestles [notched in five places upon which the canes separating the loaves rested]. Perhaps because of their notches they were so called [<i>ksavoth</i>], with the letter <i>tzade</i> [<i>ktzavoth</i> — sides, corners] being used instead of the letter <i>sin</i> [<i>ksavoth</i>], this word [<i>ksavoth</i>] being similar to [the word <i>ktzavoth</i> found in the following verse]: <i>so that they that dwell in ‘ktzavoth’ (the uttermost parts) stand in awe of Thy signs</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">150</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 65:9.</i> by interchanging the letter <i>tzade</i> with the <i>sin</i>, just like in the word <i>s’chok</i> [“laughter,” which is the word <i>tzchok</i>].<br>Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote: “There is an error in Chronicles,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">151</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Chronicles 28:17.

                    "OF A TALENT OF PURE GOLD SHALL HE MAKE IT WITH ALL THESE VESSELS. This means “that its weight together with all its vessels shall be exactly one talent, neither less nor more.” This is Rashi’s language. And such indeed is the simple meaning of Scripture. But if that be so, there is here a point which is greatly to be wondered about, namely that Scripture should not specify at all how much of the talent of gold should go into the candelabrum itself! For in that case half of the talent or even more could then go into the making of the tongs and the snuffdishes<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">175</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 38.</i> which are vessels separate from the candelabrum, while the candelabrum itself could be made of less than half the talent, or perhaps the candelabrum would be made of the entire talent less one <i>maneh</i> [a sacred talent consisted of one hundred and twenty <i>manoth</i>] and all these vessels would be made of the one <i>maneh</i>! Moreover, what reason is there that the total weight of the candelabrum with its many separate vessels should be given as one talent, and why was it not explained how many tongs and snuffdishes should be made from it?<br>But the opinion of our Rabbis is not as the Rabbi [Rashi] stated it, for thus did the Sages teach in Tractate Menachoth:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">176</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Menachoth 88b.</i> “The candelabrum and its seven lamps<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">177</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 37. — These were a kind of small receptacle into which the oil and the wicks were put (Rashi).</i> came from the talent, but not its tongs and snuffdishes. And if you ask how will I then explain, [<i>Of a talent of pure gold shall he make it</i>,] <i>with all these vessels?</i> Then I reply that this includes the lamps. These are the words of Rabbi Yehudah. Rabbi Nechemyah says: the candelabrum [alone] came from the talent but not its lamps, tongs, and snuffdishes. And if you ask how will I then explain the expression, <i>with all these vessels?</i> I answer that it teaches that they all be made of gold [aside of the talent mentioned].” There in Tractate Menachoth the Rabbis have further said, that according to Rabbi Yehudah [who says that the lamps came from the talent], the lamps were also of beaten work together with the candelabrum; yet Scripture calls them <i>these ‘vessels,’</i> because they are receptacles for the oil, known by a name of their own, since in all other candelabrums they are separate from them [although here they were hammered out of the same talent of gold from which the whole candelabrum was made]. And according to Rabbi Nechemyah [who says that the lamps did not come from the talent, the Rabbis] have said there that the lamps were not of beaten work together with the candelabrum. Thus according to Rabbi Yehudah included in the weight of the talent — with that which was of beaten work with it — is only the candelabrum itself but none of the separate vessels thereof. And according to Rabbi Nechemyah the Rabbis have said there: “And if you ask how will I then explain the expression, <i>with all these vessels</i>? I answer, it teaches that they all be made of gold, this being necessary to be stated because of the mouth of the lamps.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">178</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One might think that the mouth of the lamps where the wicks burn and become blackened should not be made of pure gold, since the Torah cares for the wealth of Israel; therefore Scripture let it be known that even the mouth of the lamps be made of pure gold (Rashi, Menachoth 88 b).</i><br>According to the simple meaning of Scripture the verse states: “<i>Of a talent of pure gold shall he make it; all these vessels</i> he shall [also] make of pure gold,” since He did not explain at first that the lamps<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">179</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That the tongs and snuffdishes are to be made of pure gold is clearly stated in Verse 38. However, concerning the lamps He did not mention at all (in Verse 37) that they be made of pure gold. Hence the reverting to them in Verse 39 before us.</i> should be of gold. Similarly, Scripture relates at the time of the making of the candelabrum, <i>And he made the lamps thereof, seven, and the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, of pure gold</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">180</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 37:23.</i> the expression <i>of pure gold</i> referring only to the tongs and the snuffdishes [but not to the lamps], and therefore He explained it further and said, <i>Of a talent of pure gold he made it, and all the vessels thereof</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">181</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 24.</i> the meaning being that all its vessels he [i.e., Bezalel] made of pure gold, not that he made them out of the talent of gold. Included in the expression <i>all the vessels thereof</i> are the oil vessels, for he made with the candelabrum many vessels besides those mentioned, just as it is said during the journeyings, <i>And they shall cover the candelabrum of the light, and its lamps, and its tongs, and its snuffdishes, and all the oil vessels thereof, wherewith they minister unto it</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">182</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 4:9.</i> And the verse which states, <i>unto the base thereof, and unto the flowers thereof, it was beaten work</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">183</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 8:4.</i> likewise indicates according to its plain sense that only the candelabrum itself was of beaten work but not its lamps. All this is in accordance with the line of teaching of the Gemara.<br>But in the Beraitha of the work of the Tabernacle<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">184</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See above, Note 108.</i> it is taught in another way. “The candelabrum which Moses made in the wilderness was made of gold. It had to be made by a process of beating, and had to have cups, knops, and flowers, for it is said, <i>And thou shalt make a candelabrum of pure gold</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">185</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 31.</i> I might have thought that [the cups etc.] may be made separately and then soldered on to the candelabrum; Scripture therefore states, <i>they shall be of one piece with it</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">186</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 36.</i> How do we know that this includes lamps, so that they must also be made of one piece with it? Scripture therefore says, [<i>Of a talent of pure gold</i>] <i>he shall make</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">187</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 39 before us.</i> I might think this also includes its cups, knops, and flowers? Scripture therefore says, <i>it</i> [<i>he shall make ‘it’</i>]. Now how do you know that you are to include its lamps and exclude its cups, knops and flowers? Since Scripture has here used a term of amplification and followed it by a term of limitation,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">188</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A literal translation of the text here reads: “After it included its lamps Scripture limited.” I have followed on this point Ish Shalom’s text (see Note 108). The thought conveyed would seem to be identical in both versions.</i> I reason as follows: I include its lamps because they have to be made with the candelabrum, and I exclude its cups, knops and flowers because they do not always have to be made with it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">189</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The intent, as explained further on, is as follows: even if the candelabrum is made of any other metal beside gold it must also contain the branches. But cups, knops, and flowers are to be made only if the candelabrum is made out of gold. — When the Hasmonean kings recaptured the Temple from the hands of the Greeks the candelabrum was first made of iron, then of silver and finally when the people could afford it, they made it of gold (Menachoth 28 b). Now when it was made of iron or silver it did not need cups, knops etc.</i> And how do I know that I am to include its <i>malkocheha</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">190</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Up to this point we have followed all standard commentators — Rashi, Onkelos, etc. as well as all translations — that <i>melkochayim</i> are “tongs.” But from this point on it is clear [and Ramban will so clarify it further] that <i>melkochayim</i> are a sort of cover-like part for each of the lamps so that no impurities fall into the lamp while it is burning. Ramban’s comment that “in the same way they make today in candelabrums for kings” is obviously a reference to what he had personally seen in the royal palace of the Kingdom of Aragon which as the recognized leader of the Jews he often visited.</i> and <i>machtotheha?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">191</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The same change applies to <i>machtoth</i> which we have translated till now as “snuffdishes.” But it is clear that Ramban interprets it now as meaning that underneath each lamp there was a small receptacle for the sparks to fall into.</i> Scripture therefore says, [<i>of beaten work</i>] <i>shall it be done</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">185</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 31.</i> I might think I am also to include the <i>tzvatim</i> (tongs) and the snuffers; Scripture therefore says, [<i>Of a talent of pure gold he shall make</i>] <i>it</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">187</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 39 before us.</i> And how do you know that you are to include the <i>malkocheha</i> and <i>machtotheha</i> and exclude the tongs and the snuffers? Since Scripture has here used a term of amplification and followed it by a term of limitation, I reason as follows: I include the <i>malkocheha</i> and <i>machtotheha</i> because they are used with the candelabrum, and I exclude the tongs and the snuffers because they are not used with it. Rabbi Yehoshua the son of Korcha says: <i>It</i> [i.e., the candelabrum] is made of the talent, but not its vessels, for it is said, <i>Of a talent of pure gold he shall make ‘it.’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">187</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 39 before us.</i> And if you ask how will I then explain the expression, <i>and all its vessels</i>? Then I reply that it means that they should be made of pure gold [but not of the talent].” Thus far is the text of the Beraitha.<br>It appears from that which the Rabbis, of blessed memory, have said, that the lamps, the <i>melkochayim</i>, and the <i>machtoth</i> were all made of beaten work together with the candelabrum; since the <i>melkochayim</i> were not tongs [as we understood the word till now]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">192</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And as Rashi and Onkelos interpreted <i>melkochayim</i> to mean “tongs.”</i> but they were rather golden lids which were made on the rim of the lamps for opening and closing, and would cover them so that nothing fell into the oil, in the same way that they make today in candelabrums for kings. This usage [of the word <i>melkochayim</i>] is associated with the expression, <i>and my tongue cleaveth ‘malkochay’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">193</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 22:16.</i> — the palate and bottom parts of the mouth being called <i>melkochayim</i> [of the root <i>loko’ach</i> — “taking”] because they “take in” the tongue between them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">194</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The above-mentioned verse from the Psalms would then mean: “and my tongue cleaveth to the roof and bottom of my mouth.”</i> The <i>machtoth</i> are receptacles under each lamp to catch the sparks of fire which might fall from them. The <i>melkochayim</i> and the <i>machtoth</i> were all of one beaten work with the candelabrum and were made out of the talent of gold. But the tongs and the snuffers, which were not used in the candelabrum itself but were instead vessels separate from it and not attached thereto, did not come from the talent at all. Similarly this Beraitha excluded its cups, knops and flowers, so that if he wanted to make them not of beaten work together with the candelabrum he was so permitted, the reason according to the Beraitha being “because they are not made with it,” that is to say, they do not invalidate the candelabrum. For if he made it of any other metal besides gold, it did not come with cups, knops and flowers, but the [six] branches [with the central shaft] always invalidated the candelabrum if lacking therefrom.<br>According to this Beraitha then, the Scriptural expression, <i>and all the vessels thereof</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">181</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 24.</i> means that Bezalel made of gold all vessels needed for the proper use of the candelabrum and appropriate to it — these being the tongs and the snuffers that are necessary in the use of all candelabrums. Similarly, <i>All the instruments of the Tabernacle in all the service thereof</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">195</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 27:19.</i> means all instruments needed for [erecting] the Tabernacle. These He did not explain but mentioned only that they were to be made of brass. But the verse before us which states, <i>Of a talent of pure gold shall he make it, with all these vessels</i>, refers to those vessels mentioned [in the preceding verse, namely, <i>malkocheha</i> and <i>machtotheha</i>], and they were all of beaten work with it. It is possible that the statement which Scripture uses at the construction, namely, <i>and all the vessels thereof</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">181</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 24.</i> alludes to these vessels [the <i>malkocheha</i> and <i>machtotheha</i>] mentioned there in the preceding verse, so that they were all to be made with the candelabrum of beaten work, as is the plain meaning of Scripture. But <i>the vessels of oil</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">182</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 4:9.</i> were not mentioned at the construction just as they were not mentioned at the command [for making the candelabrum], but they made them on their<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">196</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., Bezalel and Oholiab.</i> own accord. Perhaps Bezalel did not make them but certain individuals made them and dedicated them to the public.<br>In summary, the candelabrum itself came from the talent, but nothing outside of it came therefrom, according to the words of all authorities."

                    "TWO TENONS SHALL THERE BE IN EACH BOARD. Rashi wrote: “He cut out the lower part of the board in the middle to a height of one cubit, and he left one quarter of its width on the one side and one quarter of it on the other side. These [pieces on each side] are the <i>yadoth</i> (the tenons). The part cut out between the tenons was one half of the breadth of the board, and these tenons they fixed into the sockets which were hollowed out. The sockets were one cubit in height, forty of them fitting closely one to the other. The tenons of the boards which were fixed into the sockets were cut away on three sides, the width of the portions cut away being equal to the thickness of the rim of the sockets, so that when the boards [were fitted into the sockets, the wood of the board] would cover the entire top of the socket. For if this were not so [if the same thickness were not cut away from the tenons], there would have been a space between one board and the other equal to the thickness of the rims of the two sockets which would have separated them. This is what is meant when it is said, <i>And they shall be coupled together beneath</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">197</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 24.</i> meaning, that they should cut away the sides of the tenons so that the boards should fit closely one to the other.” So I found the language of the Rabbi.<br>But I wonder! If the part cut away in the middle was half of the breadth of the board [as Rashi has it] — measuring four and a half handbreadths<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">198</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The whole breadth of the board was a cubit and a half (Verse 16) which are nine handbreadths, and a half thereof is four and a half.</i> — it follows that the thickness of the rim of each socket must be the same as a fourth of the breadth of the board, which is two handbreadths and a thumb, in order that the thickness [of the rims] of the two sockets should cover the part cut away in the middle, which is half of the breadth of the board, and thus there would be no space between one socket and the other. But if so, if you cut away the boards<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">199</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“The boards.” In Mizrachi quoting Ramban: “the tenons.” This is correct. The Hebrew text before us also means the same, except that the term “boards” is here used in a general sense.</i> on three sides in that way, there would be nothing left [for the tenons], since the rims of the sockets were alike on all sides! Moreover, the Rabbi [Rashi] brought proof further on in Verse 20, stating: “Thus it is taught in the Mishnah of ‘The structure of the Tabernacle:' The order of arranging the boards for making the Tabernacle was as follows: He made the sockets hollow and cut away from<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">200</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The text in Rashi states <i>v’choreitz</i> (and he cuts away) — “and he cuts away a quarter on one side and a quarter on the other side.” Ramban will then ask: if in addition to these two quarters which he cuts away at the sides he also cuts away in the middle half of the width of the board — then there is nothing left for the tenons! Mizrachi answers that Rashi’s understanding of the Beraitha was that the expression “a quarter on one side etc.” does not refer to the cutting away but to what is “left” at the sides of the board as tenons. The translation would then be: “and he cuts the board at the bottom, [leaving] a quarter on one side and a quarter on the other.” To understand the text of Ramban though requires the first translation as above.</i> the board at the bottom a quarter of its width on one side and a quarter on the other, and the cut-away portion in the middle totalled one half of its width. Thus they made for each board two tenons like two rungs of a ladder, and these they fixed into the two sockets.” But if one takes this Beraitha too in its ordinary sense, it would result in something exceedingly astonishing. For if he cuts away from the board a quarter on each side, and in the middle he cuts away half of the breadth of the board, then the whole bottom part [to the height of a cubit] is cut away, and nothing is left of it at all [to serve as a tenon]! In my opinion, however, this Beraitha did not specify the size of the amount cut away, since the Torah also gave no measurements for the thickness of the rims of the sockets. Therefore what the Rabbis [in this Beraitha] said is that he cut away a quarter of the total amount of the board on one side in order to cover one rim of the socket, and another quarter he cut away on the other side; and in the middle of the board he cut away <i>half</i> of the total amount cut away from the whole board, in order to cover the rims of the two sockets.<br>But according to all opinions it still needs to be clarified further, because the Tabernacle at the bottom to the height of a cubit was not wide ten cubits,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">201</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is to say, Scripture states that the height of each board was to be <i>ten</i> cubits (Verse 16). But because of the cutting away at the bottom to the height of a cubit for the tenons, its size was reduced to <i>nine</i> cubits high, as it lay on top of the sockets!</i> since the thickness of the two sockets, one on each side, reduced its size! Perhaps there is no objection to that. And in the words of Rashi we read: “He cut away from the thickness of the tenons inside, out of the board which was a cubit thick, according to the thickness of the rims of the sockets”. This is correct, but it is not mentioned in the Beraitha.",
                    "MESHULAVOTH ISHAH EL ACHOTHAH’ (SET IN ORDER ONE TO ANOTHER). “<i>Meshulavoth</i> means made like <i>shlivoth</i> (rungs of) a ladder. <i>One to another</i>, this means that they should correspond exactly one to the other, and should be separated from each other, and so planed at their ends that they may be inserted into the hollow of the sockets, just like a rung enters the holes of a ladder’s uprights; further, that the portions cut away [from the boards] in their fronts and backs should be alike, one identical to the other, in order that there should not be two tenons, one of which extends towards the front and the other towards the back in relation to the thickness of the board which was one cubit.” This is Rashi’s language.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">202</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It should be noted that the version of Rashi here in Ramban is somewhat different in the order of the phrases from the standard editions of Rashi.</i><br>Thus according to Rashi the word <i>meshulavoth</i> refers back to the tenons, that they be planed at their ends so that they enter the hollow of the sockets, and <i>ishah el achothah (one to the other)</i> refers only to the boards, that they be fitted close together. But the Hebrew word <i>krashim</i> (boards) is masculine, and therefore it should have rather said <i>ish el achiv</i> [“one to the other” — in the masculine form]!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">203</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And not <i>ishah el achothah</i> — which is in the feminine form.</i> Perhaps [Rashi] will interpret <i>ishah el achothah</i> as meaning that the <i>shlivoth</i> [literally: “the rungs” but here referring to the <i>yadoth</i>, the tenons — a feminine form] correspond exactly one with the other, and the thickness of wood cut away from each of the tenons be exactly alike, for in that way the boards will fit closely together. Now the tenons were not planed in a sloping fashion, for the hollow of the sockets was alike in each of them; they were cut only on their sides in order that the boards fit closely one to another.<br>But in the Beraitha on the work of the Tabernacle I found the following text: “Two <i>sanin</i> (‘pegs’) [as explained further] projected from the boards, two from each of them, fitting into corresponding holes, for it is said, <i>meshulavoth ishah el achothah</i>. These are the words of Rabbi Nechemyah. For Rabbi Nechemyah says: It should not have said <i>meshulavoth</i>; what does Scripture teach us then by using that word? It is to teach us that he make them like the rungs of an Egyptian ladder.” Now the meaning of the word <i>sanin</i> is similar to the device they make in chests to tighten and hold the boards together, a sort of wooden peg, somewhat like that which we have been taught in the Mishnah of Keilim:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">204</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Keilim 10:6.</i> “If [two boards] were fastened together with <i>sanin</i> (pegs) or joints they need not be plastered in the middle.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">205</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the pegs or joints hold the boards together tightly they need not be plastered in the middle to afford protection from corpse uncleanness.</i> In the Talmud<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">206</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Baba Metzia 117a.</i> they likewise speak of “reeds and <i>sanin</i>.” Accordingly it would appear that Scripture is telling us that he is to make a projection on the side of the board, like a sort of “male shafts,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">207</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Succah 12b.</i> and on the opposite side of the board next to it he is to make a corresponding cavity into which the arrow-head is set. The same he is to do on the other board, thus dovetailing each board twice [one on each side]. <i>Meshulavoth ishah el achothah</i> is thus a reference to these <i>shlivoth</i> (pegs) themselves [and not to the tenons as Rashi has it], and is here properly in the feminine form [<i>ishah el achothah</i>, because of the word <i>shlivah</i> which is feminine]. And so did the Sages make mention of this term in the feminine: “The <i>shlivah</i> (rundle) slipped from under him;”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">208</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Makkoth 7b.</i> “In a ladder it depends on the material of <i>shlivothav</i> (its steps).”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">209</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shabbath 60a. And if the steps are of metal the whole ladder is susceptible to uncleanness.</i> And even though we find the plural of this word in the masculine form — <i>between ‘hashlabim’ (the stays)</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">210</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Kings 7:28.</i> — it is like <i>nashim</i> (women) and <i>pilagshim</i> (concubines) whose plural form is in the masculine.",

The word <i>kedem</i> (east) is not found in connection with the boards, as the Tabernacle on that side had only a curtain. Hence Ramban chose a verse from the following chapter which mentions <i>kedem</i>, and then he will revert to the theme of the boards, and explain the terms <i>negbah, teimanah</i> (the south side, southward) mentioned here in the following Verse 18.</i> The reason for this expression is that the Sacred Language calls the east <i>kedem</i>, just as it is said, <i>And ye shall measure without the city for the side of ‘keidmah’ (east) two thousand cubits</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">212</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 35:5.</i> and calls the west <i>achor</i> (back), just as it is said, <i>Behold, I go ‘kedem’ (forward), but He is not there, v’achor (and backward), but I cannot perceive Him</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">213</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 23:8.</i> Similarly: <i>As far as ‘ha’achron’ (the hinder) sea</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">214</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 34:2.</i> which means the western sea. Both [<i>kedem</i> and <i>achor</i>] are borrowed terms, as the Sacred Language adopts these substitute forms from the standpoint of a person who turns to the light of the sun [thus calling the east <i>panim</i>, “face,” because his face is turned eastward to the rising sun, and the west <i>achor</i>, “back,” because his back is then to the west]. Similarly it says, <i>and they went l’achor (backward) and not ‘l’panim’ (forward)</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">215</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 7:24. According to Ramban the sense of the verse is: they went away from the light [the word of G-d] and did not go towards it.</i> And the south is called <i>negev</i> (dry, parched) because the land is dried up on account of the heat. At times Scripture mentions the borrowed term and then explains it by name.

The south is also called <i>yamin</i> [which means “right”] and the north is called <i>smol</i> [meaning “left”] with reference to a man who turns eastward [to face the light of the rising sun, in which case his right hand is to the south, and his left to the north], as I have mentioned.<br>The secret of these names is known from the mystic speculations on the Chariot on high [i.e. the vision of Ezekiel of the Divine Chariot].

                    "AND THEY SHALL BE COUPLED TOGETHER ABOVE THE HEAD OF IT UNTO THE ONE RING. According to Rashi’s interpretation this verse goes back to explain that all the boards should be coupled together beneath, where the boards were cut away on their sides, and they all should be <i>coupled together about the head of it</i>, meaning “of each board.” Or it may be that <i>rosho (the head of it)</i> refers to the top of the Tabernacle. Similarly, [according to Rashi] the expression <i>unto the one ring</i> means of each of the boards. Likewise he explained, <i>thus shall it be for them both</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">223</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the second half of Verse 24 (before us).</i> for the two end boards [for the board at the end of the north side and for the adjacent board in the western wall].<br>But if this is so, I do not know why Scripture does not explicitly tell us about these rings, saying “and you shall make twenty gold rings” [instead of saying, <i>unto the one ring</i>, which means of each board], seeing that it mentions the cut which he is to make in all the boards.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">224</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 17.</i> Moreover, how could Scripture say <i>unto the one ring</i> with the definite article [when it has not mentioned it previously]? Perhaps because it is the customary manner with all houses made of boards to attach them at the top with one ring, Scripture shortened the explanation and said <i>the ring</i> — meaning the one which is known to him and customary. Similarly it said of the bars, <i>and thou shalt make their rings of gold for places for the bolts</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">225</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 29.</i> which means the customary [rings] being known to them. A similar case is the expression, <i>their hooks shall be of gold</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">226</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 37.</i><br>I have found in the Beraitha on the work of the Tabernacle [the following text]: “He cut away the board at the top, a fingerbreadth on one side and a fingerbreadth on the other side, and he placed them [i.e., the two adjacent boards] inside one gold ring in order that they should not move apart from each other, for it is said, <i>And they shall be coupled together beneath, and they shall be coupled together above the head of it unto the one ring</i>. Now it need not have said, <i>unto the one ring;</i> and what does it teach us by saying it? It is to teach us that this is the place where the bolts were inserted.” Accordingly, the verse stating: <i>and they shall be coupled together above the head of it</i>, refers to the head of the board where it was cut away until the place of the upper ring of the bolts, for the incision in the board was to extend as far as the place of the ring. Now Scripture was not particular [concerning these upper parts of the boards] how they should be attached, whether with rings of silver or gold, fixed ones or moveable, or with connecting rods. But the Beraitha states that Moses made rings for that purpose. However, in line with the plain meaning of Scripture this verse refers only to the endboards."

And in Tractate Tamid<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tamid 3:9.</i> we have been taught as follows: “[The priest] who was privileged to clean out the candelabrum [during the morning service] entered [the Sanctuary], and if he found the two easternmost lamps burning, he cleaned out the rest [leaving them to be lit during the evening service], but the two easternmost lamps he left burning as they were. If he found that [the two easternmost lamps] had gone out, he cleaned them out and kindled them from those that were still burning, and then cleaned out the rest” [leaving them to be kindled during the evening service].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This text again shows that there were lamps burning in the candelabrum the whole day. — In case the priest found that all the lights had gone out it has already been mentioned above in Ramban’s text quoting the Torath Kohanim that the <i>neir ma’aravi</i> was then kindled from the fire upon the altar of the burnt-offering which stood outside in the Sanctuary Court.</i> Now this anonymous Mishnah conforms to the opinion of Rabbi<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Yehudah Hanasi. See in <i>Seder Mishpatim</i> Note 64.</i> who says that the lamps of the candelabrum were placed in an east-west direction, and the <i>neir ma’aravi</i> (the western light) in his opinion is the second light from the east side.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For since the candelabrum was standing with its six branches extending in an east-west direction, the first [the easternmost] light could not be considered as being <i>before the Eternal</i>, since that expression implies that there is one light still further away from the Holy of Holies [where the Divine Glory abided]. Hence the first lamp of which it might be said that it is <i>before the Eternal</i> is the second from the east, and since we must not pass over an occasion for performing a religious act, the second light from the east becomes affixed as being <i>before the Eternal</i>, and that is the <i>neir ma’aravi</i> (the western light). — There is, however, another opinion [mentioned further on in the text] that the candelabrum was placed in a south-north direction, and the term <i>neir ma’aravi</i> was given to the middle lamp, because the three lamps on each side turned towards the center one. — Menachoth 98b. See also Shabbath 22 b, Rashi.</i> It is called <i>ma’aravi</i> (western) because it is to the west of the first, and since he has to kindle the western light to fulfill therewith the Divine command <i>before the Eternal continually</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 24:3, and Verse 2 here.</i> he must kindle also the easternmost lamp, for the second lamp cannot be called “western” until there be an “eastern” next to it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hence if the ministering priest found that the two easternmost lamps had gone out, he trimmed them and kindled them both. For although the command regarding the perpetual lamp [burning day and night] applied essentially to the second — the western — light, yet since it could not be called “western” unless there was an “eastern” in front of it, the priest lit both.</i> But according to the opinion of the Sage<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is Rabbi Eleazar the son of Rabbi Shimon (Menachoth 98 b).</i> who says that the candelabrum was placed in a north-south direction, the <i>neir ma’aravi</i> was the middle one — on the central shaft of the candelabrum — and that light alone he kindled in the morning [for since none of the lamps were “outside” of it towards the east it was not necessary that another lamp be lighted].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus there appears an important difference as to the number of lights that burned a whole day in the candelabrum. According to Rabbi who holds that the candelabrum was placed in an east-west direction, the two easternmost lamps burned a whole day [for reasons explained in Note 24]. But according to Rabbi Eleazar the son of Rabbi Shimon who says that the candelabrum was placed in a north-south direction, only the middle lamp burned a whole day.</i> Thus the principle is clear that the expression <i>before the Eternal continually</i> applies to “the western light,” which burns regularly day and night."

                    "AND THOU SHALT PUT IN THE BREASTPLATE OF JUDGMENT THE URIM AND THE THUMMIM. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra thought to display wisdom in the matter of the Urim and the Thummim, by saying that they were made by a craftsman from gold and silver, and he continued his discussion of them in this vein, for he thought that they were akin to the forms which the astrologers make in order to know the thoughts of the one who comes to ask of them [about the future]. But what [Ibn Ezra] said is of no import. Rather, the Urim and the Thummim are as Rashi has written: “This was an inscription of the Proper Name of G-d which was placed between the folds of the breastplate.” It was for this reason that the breastplate had to be double<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">73</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 16.</i> [i.e., made of a material that was folded in order to form a sort of bag, into which the Urim and the Thummim — the sacred Names of G-d, as explained further on, — were placed by Moses]. The proof for this is that in the work of the craftsmen the Urim and the Thummim are not mentioned at all, neither in the command nor in the [description of the] making thereof. Now concerning the garments He details: <i>And he made the ephod</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">74</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 39:2.</i> <i>and he made the breastplate</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">75</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 8.</i> but it does not say, “and he made the Urim and the Thummim.” And if it were the work of a skilled engraver He would have dealt with it in greater length than with all [the garments]. Even if perhaps He desired to shorten the discussion about them on account of their profundity, He would at least have said here, “and thou shalt make the Urim and the Thumim as it has been shown to you in the mount; of pure gold — or purified silver — you shall make them.” moreover, you will notice that He did not use the definite article in connection with any of the vessels [of the Tabernacle] which had not been previously mentioned. Instead, He said, <i>and they shall make an ark;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">76</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 25:10.</i> <i>and thou shalt make a table;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">77</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 23.</i> <i>and thou shalt make a candelabrum,</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">78</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 31</i> and thus too in connection with all of them. In the case of the Tabernacle, however, He said, <i>And thou shalt make ‘the’ Tabernacle</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">79</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 26:1.</i> because He had already mentioned it [in saying], <i>And let them make Me a Sanctuary</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">80</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 25:8.</i> Now with reference to the Urim and the Thummim He said, <i>And thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment ‘the’ Urim and ‘the’ Thummim</i>. He did not command him as to the making of them, and yet Scripture mentions them with the definite article! Moreover, Scripture mentions them with reference to Moses only, saying by way of command, <i>and thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment…;</i> similarly, at the time of making them it says, <i>and in the breastplate he put the Urim and the Thummim</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">81</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 8:8.</i> since they were not the work of craftsmen. Neither craftsmen nor the congregation of Israel had any part whatsoever in their making or in their donation, for they were a secret transmitted by the Almighty to Moses, and he wrote them in holiness. They<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">82</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Ricanti [quoting the language of Ramban]: “Or they were…”</i> were thus of heavenly origin, and therefore they are referred to without any specification and with the definite article, in a similar usage to that which we have in the verse, <i>and He placed at the east of the garden of Eden the cherubim</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">83</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 3:24. Here too Scripture uses the definite article [<i>‘the’ cherubim</i>] and yet nowhere previously do we read concerning them (Bachya).</i> Now Moses took the inscription of the Urim and the Thummim, and placed them in the breastplate of judgment after he had clothed Aaron with the ephod and the breastplate, as it is said, <i>And he put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the skilfully-woven band of the ephod… And he placed the breastplate upon him; and in the breastplate he put the Urim and the Thummim</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">84</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 8:7-8.</i> For only after [Aaron was already clothed with the ephod and the breastplate] did Moses place the Urim and the Thummim between the folds of the breastplate.<br>Thus the Urim and the Thummim were the holy Names of G-d, and it was by virtue of the power residing in these Names that the letters inscribed upon the stones of the breastplate would light up before the eyes of the priest who inquired of their judgment.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">85</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 27:21.</i> For example, when they inquired, <i>Who shall go up for us first against the Canaanites, to fight against them</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">86</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Judges 1:1. — Scripture continues [in Verse 2]: <i>And the</i> Eternal said: <i>‘Yehudah ya’aleh’ (Judah shall go up)</i>.</i> the priest fixed his thoughts on those Divine Names which were the Urim [literally: “lights”], and the letters forming the name <i>Yehudah</i> lighted up before his eyes, and [for the word <i>ya’aleh</i> — “he shall go up”] the letter <i>yod</i> lighted up from the word <i>Levi</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">87</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The twelve stones in the breastplate bore the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. Since there was no letter <i>tzade</i> amongst these names, the patriarchs’ names [<i>Avraham, Yitzchak</i> and <i>Yaakov</i>] were also inscribed upon the stones. Finally to include the letter <i>tet</i> the words <i>shivtei Y-ah</i> (“the tribes of G-d”) were also written upon them (Yoma 73 b). The answer given to the priest who inquired of the Urim and Thummim was through the gleaming forth of the letters written upon the stones. Thus when the tribes asked, <i>Who shall go up for us first against the Canaanites?</i> the name <i>Yehudah</i> gleamed forth, and as for the word <i>ya’aleh</i>, the <i>yod</i> of <i>Levi</i> lighted up etc.</i> the <i>ayin</i> from <i>Shimon</i>, the <i>lamed</i> from <i>Levi</i>, and the <i>hei</i> from <i>Avraham</i> which was also written there, according to the opinion of our Rabbis,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">88</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yoma 73b. See Note above.</i> or perhaps the <i>hei</i> from <i>Yehudah</i> lighted up a second time. Now when the letters lighted up before the eyes of the priest, he did not yet know their arrangement [that is, how these letters were to be grouped together into words], for from the letters forming the words <i>Yehudah ya’aleh</i> (Judah shall go up), it is possible to form the words: <i>hoy heid alehah</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">89</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“The echo of woe upon it.”</i> or <i>hie al Yehudah</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">90</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Lamentation upon Judah.”</i> and very many other words. But then there were other sacred Divine Names [in the fold of the breastplate] called Thummim [literally: “perfection”], through whose power the priest’s heart was made perfect to understand the meaning of the letters which lighted up before his eyes. Thus, when he fixed his thoughts on the Divine Names in the Urim, and the letters lighted up, he would then immediately turn and fix his thoughts on the Divine Names in the Thummim, whilst the letters [of the Urim] were still lit up before him, and then it came to his mind that they combine to form the words <i>Yehudah ya’aleh</i> (Judah shall go up). This knowledge [of how to combine the letters that lit up in the breastplate into words], is one level of the degrees of <i>Ruach Hakodesh</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">91</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “The Holy Spirit.” See Moreh Nebuchim II, 45, beginning: “second degree of prophecy.”</i> It is lower than prophecy, and higher than the <i>Bath Kol</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">92</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “echo” or “reverberating sound.” It is here used in the sense of a Divine Voice which on certain occasions was heard coming forth from the Holy of Holies (Sotah 33 a).</i> which served [Israel] in the Second Sanctuary after prophecy had ceased, and after the Urim and Thummim had ceased, just as our Rabbis have mentioned.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">93</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yoma 21b.</i> It is possible that after Moses placed the sacred Names of the Urim and Thummim in the breastplate, they became known to the great Sages of Israel, having been transmitted to them from Moses together with the secrets of the Torah. Hence we find that David possessed an ephod<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">94</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 23:6.</i>, which was similar to the ephod of Moses, and together with it was a breastplate similar to the holy breastplate [in the Tabernacle]. It appears, however, that [instead of being made of gold, blue-purple etc.] it was made of linen, just as it says of Samuel that he was <i>a child, girden with a linen ephod</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">95</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 2:18.</i> and of Nob, the city of priests, it is said, <i>fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid</i>, 22:18.</i> They would clothe a priest who was of <i>the sons of the prophets</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">97</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Kings 4:1.

Using this responsum as a basis, Ibn Ezra commented that if Rashi had seen this responsum he would not have written that the Urim and Thummim were inscriptions of the Proper Name of G-d etc. [as quoted above]. — To this comment of Ibn Ezra, Ramban answers caustically: “We have already seen this responsum of Rabbeinu Hai and have pondered its meaning, and we do know that it was Ibn Ezra’s understanding that did not grasp it.”</i> he would not have explained as he did, [that the Urim and Thummim were inscriptions of the Proper Name of G-d] — now we have already seen that responsum and have considered it, and we know [for a certainty] that it was Rabbi Abraham whose opinion [shows that he] did not grasp it."

                    "ME’IL’ (ROBE). Rashi commented:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">99</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On Verse 4 above.</i> “This was a kind of shirt, and so also was the <i>k’thoneth</i>, except that the <i>k’thoneth</i> was worn next to the body and the <i>me’il</i> is a term for the upper [outer] shirt.” But this is not so, for the <i>me’il</i> is a garment in which one wraps oneself, just as Scripture says, <i>and he</i> [Samuel] <i>is covered with a ‘me’il’</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">100</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 28:14.</i> and it is further written, <i>‘y’atoni’ (He hath covered me) with ‘me’il’ (the robe) of righteousness</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">101</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 61:10.</i> and the term <i>atiyah</i> (enwrapping) does not apply to a shirt, but to a garment with which one covers oneself, as it is said, <i>‘oteh’ (Who coverest Thyself) with light as with a garment</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">102</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 104:2.</i> it being associated with the term <i>atoph</i> (enveloping onself). And so we find: <i>and his upper lip ‘ya’teh’ (he shall cover up</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">103</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 13:45.</i> [which Onkelos renders] <i>yitatoph</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">104</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This shows that <i>atiyah</i> and <i>atoph</i> are identical terms.</i> This is identical with the word <i>kardunin</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">105</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In our Rashi: <i>kardutin</i>.</i> from the Targum of Jonathan ben Uziel which the Rabbi [Rashi] mentioned [as his translation of the word <i>me’il</i>], for this <i>kardunin</i> is used for enwrapping oneself, something akin to the form of the ephod with which [the High Priest] envelops the half of his body that is towards his feet. But if a <i>me’il</i> was a kind of shirt [as Rashi said], then <i>me’il</i> and <i>kardunin</i> would not be alike at all. Another proof is the verse, <i>and he seized the skirt of ‘me’ilo’ (his robe), and it rent</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">106</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 15:27.</i> Thus the <i>me’il</i> has skirts and is not a kind of shirt. Rather, the <i>me’il</i> is a garment which enwraps the whole body from the neck downwards to the feet of the person, and has no sleeves at all. Now in other <i>me’ilim</i> there is a piece of garment for the neck, covering the whole of it, and sewed on [with a needle], this garment being called <i>pi me’il</i> (the hole of the robe), but with reference to this <i>me’il</i> Scripture commanded that it be woven together with the robe.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">107</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 32.</i> The <i>me’il</i> is entirely slit frontwise till the bottom, and he put his head through the hole on top; thus the neck [of the priest] is enwrapped with the hole of the <i>me’il</i>, and in front of him are the two skirts with which he covers or uncovers himself at will — something like [our] cloak which has no head-tire. Now since the seam divides the front part of the <i>me’il</i> and separates it all the way downwards, therefore the term <i>atiyah</i> (enwrapping) is always used in connection with it [as explained above].<br>Nor do I know either<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">108</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., “in addition to that which I did not understand in Rashi’s definition of the <i>me’il</i> [as explained above], I also do not know why etc.”</i> why the Rabbi [Rashi] made the bells independent objects, stating that there was one bell between every two pomegranates.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">109</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi, Verse 33.</i> For if so, the pomegranates served no purpose. And if they were made just for ornament, why were they made like hollow pomegranates? Let him rather make them like golden apples! Moreover, Scripture should have explained with what the bells should be hung, and whether rings should be made on which to hang the bells. Instead, [we must say that] the bells were inside the pomegranates themselves, for the pomegranates were hollow and made in the shape of small pomegranates that have not yet burst open,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">110</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zebachim 88b.</i> and the bells were hidden inside but visible through them. Now Scripture has not specified their number. But our Rabbis have said<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">110</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zebachim 88b.</i> that there were seventy-two bells and within them there were seventy-two clappers; he hung thirty-six on one side and thirty-six on the other side, as is found in Tractate Zebachim, in the chapter The Altar Sanctifies.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">110</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zebachim 88b.</i> From here also you may learn that the <i>me’il</i> was not a sort of shirt or <i>kthoneth</i> [as Rashi wrote], but instead it had skirts [front and back, and therefore the Rabbis speak of “one side” and “the other side” of the <i>me’il</i>].<br>Similarly Rashi wrote<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">99</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On Verse 4 above.</i> that “the <i>mitznepheth</i> (mitre) is a kind of domed helmet, for in another place<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">111</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 40.</i> the verse calls it <i>migba’oth</i>, which we translate in the Targum <i>kov’in</i> (helmets).” This also is not correct, for the Rabbis have said<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">112</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The source is not known. See my Hebrew commentary, p. 476.</i> that the <i>mitznepheth</i> was sixteen cubits long. Thus it was a sort of turban with which the head is wrapped, as he wound it around and around his head, fold upon fold. Moreover, the <i>mitznepheth</i> of the High Priest is nowhere called <i>migba’oth</i> [as Rashi said]. It is only with reference to the ordinary priests that Scripture calls the head-dress <i>migba’oth</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">113</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 39:28. [<i>And they made… the ‘mitznepheth’ (mitre) of fine linen, and the ornamented ‘migba’oth’ (head-tires) of fine linen</i>. — Thus Scripture distinguishes between the two garments, since the <i>mitznepheth</i> was made for Aaron and the <i>migba’oth</i> for Aaron’s sons. So how did Rashi write of the <i>mitznepheth</i> that in another place Scripture calls it <i>migba’oth?</i></i> and these too were a sort of turban,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">114</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban’s intent is as follows: Even if we were to say that Rashi intended to state that the head-dress for the High Priest here called <i>mitznepheth</i> is for the common priest elsewhere called <i>migba’at</i>, that too, continues Ramban, would not be correct; since the head-dress for the common priest is also called <i>mitznepheth</i>, as explained in the text (Gur Aryeh). Thus according to Ramban the head-dress for the common priest is called both <i>mitznepheth</i> and <i>migba’at</i>, while that of the High Priest is called only <i>mitznepheth</i>.</i> except that they were set upon<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">115</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The difference between the two attires is thus clear. The head-dress of the High Priest — i.e., the <i>mitznepheth</i> — was wound <i>around</i> his head in several folds like a turban, and the one for the common priest was also wound in folds (hence its name <i>mitznepheth</i>) but set <i>upon</i> his head and came up like a conical helmet [hence its other name — <i>migba’at</i>]. See also Ramban further on Verse 37, and 29:7.</i> the head and the folds came up like a sort of [conical] helmet which is the <i>kovei’a</i>, as Onkelos rendered it. For <i>migba’at</i> is like <i>mikba’at</i>, as I have said in <i>Seder Mikeitz</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">116</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 41:47 (Vol. I, pp. 505-506).</i> as the letter <i>gimmel</i> serves here as <i>kuph</i>, excepting that the <i>migba’at</i> was also wound like a <i>mitznepheth</i>. It is for this reason that the Sages always mention in Torath Kohanim<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">117</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifra <i>Tzav</i>, 2:1. — For the term Torath Kohanim see above Note 19.</i> the <i>mitznepheth</i> both in relation to the High Priest and the common priest.

To these the High Priest adds the breastplate, the ephod, the upper garment, and the frontplate.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">119</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus it is clear that the term <i>mitznepheth</i> applies to the head-dress of both the High Priest and the common priest.

But it does not appear to me to be correct, for if so He should have written this verse after having mentioned all eight garments [of the High Priest], and why did He mention it after three garments — the breastplate, the ephod, and the robe — before mentioning the frontplate, the upper garment, the mitre, the belt and the breeches! Furthermore, [the verse reads here,] <i>and when he cometh out</i> [of the Sanctuary], <i>that he die not</i>. But the act of going out [from the Sanctuary] is no function for which he should incur death if lacking the [proper number of] garments!<br>Similarly Rashi commented on the verse: “<i>And they shall be upon Aaron and upon his sons</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">120</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 43.</i> — <i>they</i> means all these garments; <i>upon Aaron and upon his sons</i>, those which are proper to him, and those specified for them.

For He had commanded that they be made, [as it is said,] <i>And thou shalt make them linen breeches</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">122</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 42.</i> and then He commanded concerning their being worn [by the priests, saying,] <i>And they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">120</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 43.</i> As to the rest of the garments, He had already given the command above concerning the making of them and wearing them, [as it is said,] <i>And thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother, and upon his sons with him</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">123</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 41.</i> If so, this command <i>[And they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons</i>]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">120</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 43.</i> refers wholly to the breeches, and the punishment likewise refers [only] to them.<br>We learn this from what the Rabbis have said in Tractates Sanhedrin<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">124</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 83b.</i> and The Slaughtering of Sacrifices:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">125</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zebachim 17b.</i> “Whence do we know that a priest who ministered [the Divine Service] lacking the [proper number of] garments is liable to death [by the hand of Heaven]? Said Rabbi Abohu in the name of Rabbi Yochanan, and they arrived in the chain of tradition up to ‘in the name of Rabbi Eleazar the son of Rabbi Shimon:' <i>And thou shalt gird them with belts, Aaron and his sons, and bind head-tires on them; and they shall have the priesthood by a perpetual statute</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">126</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 29:9.</i> the interpretation of which is: ‘So long as they wear their [appointed] garments, they are invested with their priesthood; when they do not wear their garments, they are not invested with their priesthood, and they become laymen, and it has been said that a layman who ministers [in the Sanctuary] incurs the penalty of death [by the hand of Heaven].” Now if this verse [<i>that they bear not iniquity, and die</i>]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">120</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 43.</i> were held by the Rabbis to apply to all the garments [of the priests], as the Rabbi [Rashi] said, they could have found in it an expressly stated punishment for one who ministers lacking all the garments, [and why did they need to base it upon an inference from another verse]! Rather, this verse refers only to the breeches, and the other verse to the rest of the garments, where the breeches are not mentioned at all. Proof to what the Rabbis have said [that this verse, <i>And they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons… that they bear not iniquity, and die</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">120</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 43.</i> refers only to the breeches], is that further on when the order of putting on the garments is mentioned,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">127</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 5-9.</i> the breeches are not referred to at all, for having declared here the punishment if they are lacking [when ministering in the Sanctuary], there was no more need to mention them again further on, as it is understood already that he would wear them.<br>And that which He said above [i.e., in Verse 35 before us], <i>and the sound thereof shall be heard when he goeth in unto the holy place before the Eternal, and when he goeth out, that he die not</i>, is [not as Rashi has it that from here we learn that if he enters the Sanctuary lacking one of these garments he incurs death at the hand of Heaven, but is] in my opinion an explanation for the commandment of the bells [upon the robe], since there was no need to wear them, nor are they customary amongst dignitaries. Therefore He said that He commanded that they be made in order that the sound thereof be heard in the Sanctuary, that the priest enter before his Master as if with permission. For he who comes into the king’s palace suddenly, incurs the penalty of death according to the court ceremonial, just as we find in the case of Ahasuerus.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">128</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Esther 4:11. <i>All the king’s servants… do know, that whosoever… shall come unto the king… who is not called, there is one law for him, that he be put to death</i>.</i> It thus alludes to what the Rabbis have said in Yerushalmi Tractate Yoma:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">129</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yerushalmi Yoma I,5. — On Jerusalem Talmud see in <i>Seder Bo</i>, Note 204.</i> “<i>And there shall be no man in the Tent of Meeting when he goeth in to make atonement in the holy place</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">130</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 16:17.</i> — even those [heavenly beings] of whom it is written, <i>As for the likeness of their faces they had the face of a man</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">131</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 1:10.</i> they too are not to be then in the Tent of Meeting.” Therefore He commanded that [the ministering High Priest] make a sound be heard, as if crying out, ‘<i>Cause everyone to go out from before me</i>,’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">132</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 45:1.</i> so that he can come to minister before the King alone. Similarly, when going out from the Sanctuary his sound is heard in order to leave with permission, and that the matter be known so that the King’s ministers can go out before Him. In the Chapters of the Palaces<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">133</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Pirkei Heichaloth, 31. — This is an Agadic Midrash on “The Seven Palaces of Heaven.” See Wertheimer’s ed. of Batei Midrashoth Vol. I, p. 67.</i> this subject is known. Thus the reason [for the bells upon the robe of the High Priest] is that he should not be encountered by the angels of G-d. He gave this warning concerning the High Priest<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">134</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the common priests also entered the Sanctuary in the regular daily service, the question arises why were these bells not necessary upon their garments so that their sound be heard when they come into the Sanctuary? Ramban’s answer is that this was on account of the high position of the High Priest. “For the greater the person the more are the powers of strict judgment stirred up against him” (Bi’ur Ha’lvush to Ricanti who quotes the language of Ramban).</i> on account of his high position. This is Scripture’s intent in saying, <i>when he goeth in unto the holy place before the Eternal</i>, for it is the High Priest who passes<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">135</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Another reading: “ministers.”</i> before Him so that He cause His Divine Glory to rest upon his service, <i>for he is the messenger of the Eternal of hosts</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">136</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Malachi 2:7.</i> even though the common priests also enter the Sanctuary to burn the incense and to kindle [the lamps].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">137</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yet the High Priest is more distinguished; hence the bells were necessary upon his garments and not upon those of the common priests, as explained above (see Note 134).</i><br>Now I have seen in the Midrash Shemoth Rabbah<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">138</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shemoth Rabbah 38:10.</i> with reference to the stones upon the breastplate: “For what reason were the stones? It was in order that the Holy One, blessed be He, observe them in the garments of the priest when he enters on the Day of Atonement,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">139</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When the High Priest on the Day of Atonement entered the Holy of Holies he did not wear the eight garments [amongst which was the breastplate], but instead, he wore the four linen garments [as prescribed in Leviticus 16:4]. The meaning of the Midrash must perforce be as follows: The merit of the High Priest wearing the breastplate all the year round when ministering in the Sanctuary, stood by him when he entered the Holy of Holies on the Day of Atonement, although at that moment he did not wear it.</i> and He be gracious to the tribes [whose names were inscribed upon the stones in the breastplate]. Rabbi Yehoshua in the name of Rabbi Levi says: This may be compared to a king’s son, whose tutor came before the king to speak in his defense, but was afraid of those standing there lest they strike him. What did the king do? He dressed him in his purple cloak in order that they see it and be afraid of him. In the same way Aaron entered at all times<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">140</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Reference here is to the four times that the High Priest entered the Holy of Holies during the special service for the Day of Atonement (Peirush Maharzav on Midrash Rabbah).</i> the Holy of Holies, and were it not for the many merits that entered with him and helped him, he could not have entered. Why? Because of the ministering angels who were there. What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He gave him a likeness of His sacred garment, as it is said, <i>And He put on righteousness as a coat of mail</i>.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">141</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 59:17.</i> Thus far is the language of this Agadah. Now even though the High Priest did not enter into the innermost part of the Sanctuary [i.e., the Holy of Holies] with these garments, yet on the Day of Atonement he needed these [garments] even in the Tent of Meeting, for it is written, <i>And there shall be no man in the Tent of Meeting</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">142</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 16:17.

The middle string which was on top was tied together to the ends of the two strings [at the extremities of the frontplate], and passed over above the breadth of the head. Thus it came to be that [the frontplate with the strings] formed a kind of helmet. Now it is with reference to the middle string that Scripture states, <i>and it shall be upon the mitre</i>, for he placed the frontplate [together with the strings tied in the above manner] upon his head [as a kind of helmet, passing it over the mitre], and tightened it through the middle string so that it would not fall. Thus the frontplate hung in front of his forehead. All these verses are thus reconciled: the string was on the frontplate, and the frontplate upon the string, and the string on the mitre above.” All this is Rashi’s language.<br>But I wonder concerning Rashi’s words, for Scripture commands the making of only one blue-purple string, and he makes six!

One could count in such manner in the case of the ark, the table, and the candelabrum [two of each, since they are mentioned once in the command to make, and again in the narrative when they were actually made]! Furthermore, if Scripture commanded that they put the frontplate on a blue-purple string, how did they [do the opposite and] put a blue-purple string on it? Where were they commanded to do so? And why did they need the strings in the middle, since the frontplate was tied behind the neck, as are all frontplates which are worn by men and women?<br>Indeed, the matter is not as the Rabbi [Rashi] said. For there was only one string there; the plate reached from ear to ear and was pierced at its two ends and the blue-purple string was put through the two holes, the plate being thus tied behind the neck. Thus he wound the <i>mitznepheth</i> (mitre) around the head, not at all upon the forehead, but on the head where the hair grows. And according to the opinion of our Rabbis<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">148</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zebachim 19a.</i> that he also left [uncovered] part of the hair of his head towards his face for the phylacteries, he wound [the <i>mitznepheth</i>] high above on the crown of the head, opposite the middle of the brain, covering the whole head at the back. Thus the <i>mitznepheth</i> lay above on the slope of the head opposite the brain, and the frontplate rested opposite his forehead from ear to ear, there being nothing intervening between his forehead and the frontplate. Thus the <i>mitznepheth</i> lay on the back of his head from ear to ear, opposite the whole neck, and the string which was tied to the frontplate was upon the <i>mitznepheth</i>. It is with reference to this that Scripture says, <i>And thou shalt put it on a blue-purple string</i>, meaning that he should put the string through the holes of the frontplate; <i>and</i> the string <i>shall be upon the mitre</i> behind his ears opposite the neck; <i>towards the front of the mitre it shall be</i> — that is, the frontplate, which shall be upon the forehead opposite the front part of the mitre. This is Scripture’s intent in stating, <i>And thou shalt set the mitre upon his head</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">149</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 29:6.</i> that is to say, above on the crown of the head, unlike the <i>migba’oth</i> of which it is said, <i>and thou shalt bind head-tires upon them</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">150</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 9.</i> binding the head like one whose head hurts and he binds it for the purpose of strengthening the head. It further states, <i>and thou shalt put the holy crown upon the mitre</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">149</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 29:6.</i> for it was upon the mitre that [the frontplate] was tied at the back. This is so stated: <i>And they put upon it a string of blue-purple, to fasten it upon the mitre above</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">143</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 39:31.</i> for there upon [the mitre] the string [of the frontplate] was tied. Similarly, <i>and upon the mitre, in front, did he set the golden plate</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">151</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 8:9.</i> means that he tied upon the front of the mitre the golden frontplate. Thus the term “placing” in all the verses refers to putting [the string of the frontplate] upon the mitre, for it was there that it was tied; the frontplate itself, however, was on the forehead opposite the mitre. There is then no difference between the expression <i>And they put upon it a string of blue-purple</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">143</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 39:31.</i> and [in the verse before us] <i>and thou shalt put it on a blue-purple string</i> [unlike Rashi who distinguished between them], for in both cases it is as if it said, “and thou shalt place it <i>with</i> a blue-purple string,” “and thou shalt put a blue-purple string,” similar in usage to the expression, <i>and thou shalt put them ‘on’ one basket</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">152</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 29:3.</i> which means “in” the basket. Likewise, <i>escape ‘on’ thy life</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">153</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 19:17.</i> [which means “with your life,” as long as your life is in you, or “escape for your life”]. Or it may be that the word <i>al</i> (‘on’ — <i>on a blue-purple string</i>) here serves as <i>el</i> (to), thus stating: “and you shall put it <i>to</i> a blue-purple string,” “and they put a blue-purple string <i>to</i> it,” for the string was put [to the frontplate, and the frontplate was put] to it, for it rested on it for support. In essence, the meaning of the verses is only that they should place a string in the holes of the frontplate, and in that way it also came about that the frontplate was upon the string and the string upon the frontplate. Similarly, <i>And they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof to the rings of the ephod with a string of blue-purple</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">154</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 28.</i> from which Rashi brought a proof<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">155</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Rashi’s exposition of the frontplate he had explained (as mentioned above) that there were three double strings attached to it. To answer the question why Scripture speaks only of “a thread of blue-purple” in the singular, Rashi wrote (further 39:31). “Do not be puzzled because it does not say ‘<i>threads</i> of blue-purple,’ for we find the same thing in the case of the breastplate and the ephod, of which it is said, <i>And they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof with a string of blue-purple</i> (above, Verse 28), and you must admit that there could not have been less than two strings, for at the two ends of the breastplate were the two rings of the breastplate, and on the two shoulder pieces of the ephod were two rings opposite them. Now according to the way the breastplate was tied on, there were four threads, and under any circumstance it could not have been less than two [and yet Scripture speaks only of ‘<i>a string’ of blue-purple</i>]!” — To this proof of Rashi, Ramban answers that reference is only to one string, as explained in the text.</i> [that there were three double strings in the frontplate], also refers to only one string, which they put through the rings of the breastplate and the rings of the ephod opposite them; so also on the other side there was one string, for these were two [separate] places, and in each place they tied [the breastplate by the rings thereof] with one string [of blue-purple to the rings of the ephod]."

But I have not understood his words. How does the expression of “filling the hand” come to mean “installation?” And as to that which the Rabbi said that “in the [old] French language — when a person is appointed to be in charge of any matter, the ruler puts into his hand a leather glove which they call <i>gant</i>, and by means of that glove gives him the right to that matter, and it is this which is called ‘filling the hand,’” — I do not know whether the Rabbi’s intent is to state that because of that glove the installation is called “filling the hand,” and to this he brought proof from a custom [in France]! Know that this custom they derived from the Torah, as to them this form of taking possession is [what is meant by] the acquisition by exchange mentioned in connection with Boaz, for so they translated: [<i>Now this was the custom in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging…</i>] <i>a man drew off ‘na’alo’ (his shoe)</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">156</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ruth 4:7.</i> — “a man drew off his <i>gant</i>,” and they say<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">157</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Our accepted law is that acquisition by exchange is accomplished with something that originally belongs to the buyer. Hence it was Boaz [the buyer] who “drew off his shoe” and gave it to the near kinsman. But “they say” differently, that it was the near kinsman [the seller] that gave it to Boaz. Hence they derived the custom that it is the prince [who is in the position of the bestower or seller] who pulls off his <i>gant</i> and gives it to the recipient.</i> that it was the near kinsman that gave it to Boaz. This custom of theirs is mentioned in the books of their scholars. Thus we have engaged in vain talk!<br>The correct interpretation of <i>milui yadayim</i> in the Torah is that it is an expression of perfection, similar in usage to these verses: <i>‘ki malu yamai’ (for my days are completed);</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">158</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 29:21.</i> <i>‘ubimloth’ hayamim ha’eileh’ (and when these days were fulfilled);</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">159</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Esther 1:5.</i> <i>until the days ‘m’loth’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">160</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 8:33.</i> — be fulfilled. Similarly, <i>‘b’keseph malei’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">161</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 23:9.</i> means “for the full price.” And the reason for this expression is that one might say of a stranger [i.e., a non-priest] who cannot perform the offering for his cleansing, or of any person who is not empowered to perform some royal service, that his hand misses that function; and when he becomes empowered to do it, his hand has thereby been perfected and made fit for all kinds of work and service. Thus, <i>‘milu yedchem hayom’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">162</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 32:29.</i> [generally translated: <i>consecrate yourselves today</i>] means that: “now your hands are full with the whole service of G-d, <i>for even every man upon his son, and upon his brother</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">162</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 32:29.</i> have you served Him [that day].” Or it may be that Moses was hinting to the sons of Levi that by virtue of this merit they would be chosen to perform the Divine Service in the Tabernacle, as it is said, <i>At that time the Eternal separated the tribe of Levi</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">163</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 10:8.</i> Similarly King David said to Israel on the occasion of the donations for the House [of G-d], <i>Because I have set my affection on the house of my G-d, seeing that I have a treasure of mine own of gold and silver, I give it into the house of my G-d</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">164</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Chronicles 29:3.</i> and then he continued saying, <i>Who then offereth willingly ‘l’maloth yado’ this day unto the Eternal?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">165</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 5.</i> — meaning “to perfect his hand [this day unto the Eternal],” for by doanting towards the building of the House [of G-d] their hands become full with all the sacrifices and all manner of services, for Israel’s worship of G-d is only a complete one in the Sanctuary. Similarly, <i>the ram of ‘milu’im’</i> mentioned in this section<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">166</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 29:22.</i> is so called because the filling of the priests’ duties was accomplished through this offering, for the sin-offering and the burnt-offering<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">167</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 5.</i> were to effect atonement, and this ram was to fill the priest’s hand with [the right to] sacrifice.

Hence Onkelos’ translation: “and you [i.e., Moses] will bring their sacrifices,” as during these seven days of installation you will be the priest to offer their sacrifices.</i>] followed the sense of the subject and was not pedantic as to the literal language, as is his custom in many places. Some scholars<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">170</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Found in R’dak’s Sefer Hashorashim, root <i>male</i>.</i> explain <i>umileitha eth yadam</i> as meaning that he will fill their hands [with the gifts] from the sacrifices.

And the meaning of the expression, <i>whosoever would, ‘yemalei eth yado’ that he might be one of the priests of the high places</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">171</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Kings 13:33.</i> is that he would bring for himself an offering of installation <i>as he devised of his own heart</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">172</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 12:33.</i> in order to initiate himself into his office, and thereby he became one of the priests of the high places, for they acted in a manner similar to the ways of the Torah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">173</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Leviticus 6:13. This is also applied to the ordinary priest who brought a meal-offering when he officiated for the first time.

Further, however, He does say, <i>And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave-offering… of the ram of consecration, even of that which is Aaron’s, and of that which is his sons’</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">199</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 27.</i> for the intent is to state: “just as he [Moses] takes of the offering which belongs to them all, the breast and the shoulder,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">200</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“And the shoulder,” is merely an expression, for it is clearly stated in Verse 22 that the shoulder was also burnt on the altar, and Rashi also so states it clearly.</i> so shall they — the father and the sons [High Priest and common priests] — take of the future [peace-] offerings which they [the children of Israel] will offer up.”"

Perhaps it is so. For because authority in Israel belonged to those who were anointed — the king and the High Priest — they used the term [“anointing”] metaphorically for all kinds of authority. Similarly, when it says, <i>thou shalt anoint Hazael to be king over Aram… and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy stead</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">203</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Kings 19:15-16.</i> [the term “anoint” is used metaphorically — “appoint” or “designate”]. Here, however, the correct interpretation of <i>l’moshchah bahem</i> is to anoint with the garments the High Priests above their sons, and to consecrate them to offer the sacrifices. Likewise, <i>unto thee have I given them ‘l’moshchah’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">201</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 18:8.</i> means that I have given them [i.e., the priestly gifts] because I have anointed you <i>to minister unto Me</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">204</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 1.</i> Similarly, <i>touch not ‘bimshichai’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">202</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 105:15.</i> means that he who touches them touches the anointed ones of G-d [i.e., the kings] who are destined to come from them, as He said, <i>and kings shall come out from thy loins;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">205</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 35:11.</i> <i>kings of peoples shall be of her</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">206</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 17:16.</i><br>It is even possible that we say that the expression <i>thou shalt anoint Hazael to be king over Aram</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">203</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Kings 19:15-16.</i> means that he [i.e., Elijah] is to send him oil to be anointed as king, in order to inform him that this was the command of G-d; and Elisha [his disciple] did so in accordance with the charge of his master when he told Hazael that he will rule as king.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">207</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Kings 8:13.</i> Now even though it is not written there, [he yet actually anointed him as king], and [so did Elijah] anoint Elisha as a prophet [in accordance with G-d’s command to him]. Perhaps they<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">208</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The prophets who lived in the time of Cyrus.</i> also did so to Cyrus [king of Persia] whom they anointed like the kings of Israel, in order that he would know that it was a prophet in Israel who prophesied that he would reign, and [generations before his birth] he even called forth his name, for [the glory of] G-d.

See also further on in the text.</i> And so it appears from what Scripture says, [<i>And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him:</i>] <i>‘Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the tax of Moses the servant of the Eternal, and of the congregation of Israel, for the Tent of Testimony?’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Chronicles 24:6.</i> From this it would appear that the tax of Moses was enjoined for all time — and that it was to be brought for the repair of the Temple even though no census was to be taken. Likewise the offering for [buying the public] sacrifices [was enjoined for all time] as the Sages have said, and it is so written [of Ezra and Nehemiah]: <i>Also we made ordinances for us to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our G-d; for the showbread, and for the continual meal-offering and for the continual burnt-offering, of the Sabbaths, of the New Moons, for the appointed reasons, and for the holy things, and for the sin-offerings to make atonement for Israel, and for all the work of the house of our G-d</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nehemiah 10:33-34.</i> Here it is clearly stated that they used to bring shekels every year for the sacrifices and for the Temple repair. Scripture states that the levy was <i>the third part of a shekel</i> [whereas here it is stated that it is to be half a shekel]; this was because in the days of Ezra they added to the value of a shekel, so that the third of a shekel was then ten gerahs [the equivalent of a half a shekel in the days of Moses].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>The shekel is twenty gerahs</i> (Verse 13).

Then they changed and began paying in whole <i>s’laim</i> [each one giving one <i>sela</i> — since there was a decrease in the needs of the Temple repair].

Since three <i>s’laim</i> [or shekels of the Torah] make one <i>daric</i>, it is now clear why the Mishnah quoted above states that when Israel came up from the exile they paid the shekel in <i>darics</i>, and as Ramban clearly states, “each one giving a <i>daric</i>” which was equivalent to three shekels of the Torah.</i> From here you also learn that we must not impose on the public more than three times a year” [for the Temple treasury].<br>Now Rashi wrote: “there are three offerings hinted at here<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Half a shekel for an offering to the Eternal</i> (Verse 13); <i>he shall give the offering of the Eternal</i> (Verse 14); <i>when they give the offering of the Eternal</i> (Verse 15).</i> — one was for the making of the sockets, for Moses counted them when they began to contribute towards the building of the Tabernacle after the Day of Atonement in the first year [of the exodus], — each one giving half of a shekel, and the total amounting to a hundred talents, as it is said, <i>And the silver of them that were numbered was a hundred talents</i> etc.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 38:25.</i> The second [offering] was also levied through a census, for he counted them after the Tabernacle was erected, this being the census referred to in the Book of Numbers: <i>on the first day of the second month in the second year</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 1:1.</i> each one giving a half-shekel for purchasing the public sacrifices. And if you ask: How is it possible that on both of these occasions the number of Israelites was exactly the same — 603,550?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 38:26. Numbers 1:46.</i> Were these two censuses not taken in two [different] years;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The first census was taken in the month of Tishri [after the Day of Atonement in the <i>first</i> year of the exodus]. The second census — on the first day of Iyar — was seven months later. But since we calculated the beginning of a new year [in the count after the exodus] with Nisan, the second census was therefore in the <i>second</i> year. Thus the two censuses were in two years!</i> thus it is impossible that there were no people aged nineteen at the time of the first census, [who accordingly were not counted], who became twenty years old [by the time the second census was taken, and thus must have added to the total]! The reply to this question is as follows: As far as the years of people’s ages are concerned, the two censuses were taken in one year, but counting from the exodus from Egypt, they were held in two years. For when we count from the exodus from Egypt, we calculate from Nisan, but when we count the years of man’s ages we count according to the era of the creation of the world, which begins with Tishri. In that way, the two censuses were in one year: the first census was in Tishri after the Day of Atonement, when the Holy One, blessed be He, became reconciled to Israel and they were commanded about the construction of the Tabernacle, and the second census took place [in the same year] on the first day of Iyar.” All these are the Rabbi’s words.<br>But I wonder! How is it possible that the number of deaths amongst such a great assemblage of people in a period of half a year did not run to the hundreds and thousands! For according to the words of the Rabbi [Rashi], they remained for about seven months [from about the middle of Tishri to the beginning of Iyar] without one fatality, and yet it is written, <i>But there were certain men, who were unclean by the dead body of a man</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 9:6. This happened in Nisan in the second year after the exodus. Thus it is clear that before the month of Iyar when the second census took place, there was at least one death in the camp.</i> I have also another difficulty: The years of men’s ages are not counted according to the era of the creation of the world which begins with Tishri, but are counted in astronomical years beginning with the day of one’s birth. It is for this reason that it says with reference to the people counted, that they are to be <i>from twenty years old and upward</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 1:3.</i> meaning that they are to be a full twenty years old. Similarly, all countings of the Torah with respect to people’s ages are calculated in astronomical years, just as the Rabbis have said in Tractate Arakhin:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Arakhin 18b.</i> “The ‘year’ mentioned in connection with the hallowed offerings,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Such as <i>a he-lamb of the first year</i> (Leviticus 12:6).</i> and dwelling-houses in a walled city,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If sold, these houses can be redeemed within the space of a full year (Leviticus 25:30).</i> the two ‘years’ mentioned in connection with a field which is the owner’s by inheritance [which, if sold, he may not redeem until after two years],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 25:15, and Arakhin 29b.</i> the six ‘years’ mentioned in connection with a Hebrew servant,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 21:2.</i> a son and daughter [explained further on], are all reckoned in astronomical years. Whence do we know this of the hallowed offerings? Scripture says, <i>keves ben shnatho</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Such as <i>a he-lamb of the first year</i> (Leviticus 12:6).</i> [literally: “a lamb of his year”] — his year, and not the year counted according to the era of the creation of the world etc.” Then [the Gemara] explains there: “In connection with what law does this principle affect ‘the son and daughter’ [mentioned above] ? Said Rav Gidal, It is in connection with Valuations.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If a person vows to give to the Sanctuary his “Valuation,” the sum is fixed by the Torah on the basis of years for a male and for a female (Leviticus 27:1-7). These years then are not counted according to the era of the creation of the world, but are calculated astronomically.</i> And the reason for this is because [in the case of Valuations] it says, <i>and upward</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 27:7: <i>And if it be from sixty years old and upward…</i></i> and in all censuses of the wilderness it is also written <i>and upward</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 1:3: <i>from twenty years old and upward</i>. Similarly, <i>ibid.</i>, 26:2.</i> The calculation of years in the census taken in the wilderness was thus alike in every respect to the calculation in the Valuations, as the Rabbis have said in [Tractate] Baba Bathra:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Baba Bathra 121b.</i> “The analogy is established on the basis of the identical phrase <i>and upward</i> [which is stated in the censuses taken in the wilderness, and its precise meaning is] derived from that mentioned in the law of Valuations.” And if so, all people born between Tishri and Iyar completed an astronomical year in the interim, thus between the two censuses there was bound to be a great number of people added to the total! But it would be more correct if we were to say that it so happened that the Israelites at the time of the first census [in Tishri] were 603,550 people, and in the following seven months many of them died, as is natural, and those who were twenty years old completed their twentieth year between Tishri and Iyar, and it so happened<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">By way of miracle (L’vush Ha’orah).</i> that their number corresponded exactly to that of those who died.<br>In my opinion, however, these identical numbers [of the two censuses] present no difficulty at all. For in the first census the tribe of Levi was counted together with the other tribes, since they had not yet been selected and were therefore not separated from the people, but at the second census Moses was told, <i>Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi, and neither take the sum of them among the children of Israel</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 1:49.</i> Now the number of those whose twentieth year was completed between the two censuses was close to twenty thousand<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the separate count that was taken of the Levites they numbered twenty-two thousand (<i>ibid.</i>, 3:39). But since they were numbered from the age of a month upward, Ramban rightly assumes that the Levites who were twenty years old and upward were “approximate to twenty thousand.” Their numbers [not included in the figures of the second census], were made up by those Israelites who completed their twentieth year between the two censuses.</i> [thus making up for the tribe of Levi which was not counted in the second general census]. This is clearly established [that the tribe of Levi was counted in the first census]. For since Scripture found it necessary to say at the second census, <i>Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi, and neither take the sum of them</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 1:49.</i> it is proof that until then they were counted with the other tribes of Israel; and only now was the tribe of Levi selected and numbered by itself, in order to become “the legion of the King.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 1:49, Rashi.</i> Now when Israel left Egypt they were <i>‘about’ six hundred thousand ‘g’varim’ (men) on foot</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 12:37.</i> — not “six hundred thousand;” of these there died a number of people corresponding to the number of young men whose twentieth year was completed [in the next six months between the exodus, which was in the middle of Nisan, and the first census which was taken in the middle of Tishri, when the number was 603,550]. Perhaps the term <i>g’varim</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 12:37.</i> does not denote men of twenty years of age, but all those who had reached puberty — including all those from thirteen years old upwards — and that term [<i>g’varim</i>] is only used in order to exclude women and children, as it says, <i>beside little ones</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 12:37.</i><br>It also appears to me that of the three offerings here alluded to, the one designed for purchasing the public sacrifices is not the one taken through a census and mentioned in the Book of Numbers, as the Rabbi [Rashi] said, for there it is said, <i>Only thou shalt not count the tribe of Levi</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 1:49.</i> and all the Sages agree that the Levites too were liable to give the shekels for the sacrifices; and in accordance with the words of the Sages, even the priests had to give it,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shekalim 1:4.</i> and such is the established law as is explained in Tractate Shekalim.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shekalim 1:4.</i> Moreover, the duty of giving the [half-] shekel for the sacrifices was not dependent upon a man being twenty years old or more, [as is mentioned in the case of the second census], but as soon as he could produce two [bottom] hairs he became liable to give the shekel. It is so clearly stated there [in Tractate Shekalim].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 1:3.

Ramban is following the text of Al Charizi’s translation [and not that of Ibn Tibbon].</i> “Do not think that our language is called the Sacred Language just as a matter of our pride, or it be an error on our part, but it is perfectly justified; for this holy language has no special names for the organs of generation in male or female, nor for semen, nor for urination or excretion, excepting in indirect language. Be not misled by the word <i>sheigal</i> [to take it to mean the act of intercourse; this is not the case,] but it rather denotes a female ready for intercourse. It says <i>yishgalenah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 28:30. In Tibbon’s translation there is here a completely different text.</i> in accordance with what has been written on it, and it means that ‘he will take the woman as a concubine.’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">64</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I have found this interpretation in Jonah ibn Ganach’s Sefer Hashorashim (under the root: <i>shin, gimmel, lamed</i>): “The most appropriate of the interpretations on it is that it is used in reference to a concubine.”</i> Now there is no need for this reason [why Hebrew is called the Sacred Language], for it is clear that the Hebrew language is most holy, as I have explained. And the reason [Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon] mentioned is in my opinion not correct. The mere fact that [the masters of the Masorah] have circumscribed the word <i>yishgalenah</i> [to be read as] <i>yishk’venah</i> (he will lie with her), shows that the word <i>mishgal</i> is the term for sexual intercourse itself. Similarly the fact that they circumscribed the expression, <i>to eat ‘et choreihem’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Kings 18:27.</i> [to be read <i>eth tzo’atam</i> — “their dung”] shows that <i>choreihem</i> is an indecent term. And if the reason were indeed as the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] has said, they should have called [the Hebrew language not “the Holy Language” but] “the modest langauge,” similarly to that which we have been taught [in a Mishnah]:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 68b.</i> “until he grows a beard — the lower one and not the upper one [is meant], except that the Sages spoke in modest language.” The Rabbis have further said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">67</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Bereshith Rabbah 86:6.</i> “<i>Save the bread which he did eat</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 39:6.</i> — this is a refined expression [for it refers to his wife],” and so also in many places.<br>Now Scripture explained that <i>the shekel is twenty gerahs</i>, of silver. Onkelos translated gerahs as <i>mo’ah</i>, for the gerah was, in his opinion, a name for a coin which in Aramaic is called <i>mo’ah</i>. And so did Yonathan ben Uziel translate <i>la’agorath keseph</i> (a piece of silver):<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 2:36.</i> <i>l’mo’ah d’chsaph</i> (for a <i>mo’ah</i> of silver). So also did Onkelos translate <i>after the shekel of holiness</i> as <i>sil’o</i>, for such is the name of the [shekel] coin in Aramaic, and its measure is also known in the Talmud.<br>Rashi wrote:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Seder Mishpatim</i> 21:32.</i> “A shekel weighs four gold coins, making half an ounce according to the correct weight of Cologne.” Now when the Rabbi [Rashi] found it clearly written in the Gemara<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Baba Metzia 34 b; Shebuoth 43a.</i> that a [silver] <i>sela</i> [which is equivalent to the shekel] is four [silver] <i>denars</i>, he deduced [that a gold shekel is also equivalent to four gold <i>denars</i>], for the weight of the silver <i>denars</i> is as the weight of the gold <i>denars</i>. Thus he wrote in his commentary to the Gemara of Baba Kamma:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">72</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Baba Kamma 36b.</i> “A [silver] <i>denar</i> weighs as much as a gold [<i>denar</i>], and in Constantinople they even call the gold coin <i>denar</i>.” All this is correct. But as to the Rabbi’s estimation, that in terms of the gold coins found in his generation and in our generation the shekel is equivalent to half an ounce, as he mentioned — that is not so, for the kings of the peoples have lessened [the weight of] the gold coins. We find it already mentioned in the words of the author of Hilchoth Gedoloth<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">73</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See in <i>Seder Mishpatim</i> Note 70.</i> and the first Gaonim,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">74</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Following the close of the Talmud [in the year 500 of the Common Era] the recognized spiritual heads of Jewry were the heads of the Sura and Pumbeditha academies in Babylon.

But the shekel mentioned in the words of the Sages — such as that which we have been taught in a Mishnah:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">78</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shebuoth 43a.</i> [“if a man lent his fellow money on a pledge, and the pledge was lost, and the borrower said,] ‘You have lent me a shekel on it and it was worth a <i>sela</i> [and therefore you owe me two <i>denars</i>],’ or [the lender said,] ‘I lent you a <i>sela</i> on it and it was worth a shekel [and therefore you still owe me two <i>denars</i>]’” — [this shekel] is two <i>denars</i>, half of a <i>sela</i>. The reason for this [change in the meaning of the term shekel — the shekel of the Torah being four <i>denars</i> whilst the shekel of the Sages is two <i>denars</i>], is that the people called the half-<i>s’laim</i> [which were each two <i>denars</i>] “shekels,” since they used them every year to pay the [half-] shekel to the Sanctuary. And so it was adopted by the Sages in the style of the Mishnah. Therefore a man would say to his friend, “You have lent me a shekel,” that is, the “shekel” which Israelites give to the Sanctuary.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">79</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus the shekel of the Torah is really four <i>denars</i>, but since the Torah enjoined the giving of a half-shekel, that half-shekel came to be called “shekel,” as that was the coin the people gave yearly to the Sanctuary, and hence the Sages adopted the usage of that term — so that when people say “shekel” they really mean a coin worth two <i>denars</i>.</i> It is possible that in the time of the Second Sanctuary they actually made a silver coin of two denars, so that it should be available to be given to the Temple treasurer, and they would not have to give an allowance [for exchanging the full shekel of the Torah into two half-shekels]. That coin they called “shekel,” and the shekel of Moses which is the shekel of the Torah they called <i>sela</i>, as Onkelos translated it. Some scholars<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">80</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I have not identified them.</i> say that the reason [they called the shekel of Moses <i>sela</i>] is because of what the Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">81</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Bechoroth 5a.</i> “The maneh<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">82</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The maneh is a weight equal to the sixtieth part of a talent.</i> of the Sanctuary was double [as much as the common maneh],” and so also were all the coins.

                    "THE RICH SHALL NOT GIVE MORE, AND THE POOR SHALL NOT GIVE LESS. The meaning of this is that they should all bring the specified amount of money in equality. It would appear from this verse that if the poor man gave as his shekel-dues less than the half-shekel [prescribed by the Torah], he transgresses this negative commandment, since this verse constitutes a prohibition. For even if we were to say that the phrase <i>the rich shall not give more</i> constitutes a mere negation,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">86</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See in <i>Seder Mishpatim</i>, Note 71.</i> meaning that it is enough for him to give the half-shekel, we could not so interpret <i>and the poor shall not give less</i>.

Ramban on the basis of the verse before us suggests an additional reason for this procedure.</i> was to rectify this matter, for if the poor gave less, the balance was destined to be collected from him, but as for the rich who gave more, the Temple-officers would not “take up” his surplus, for they would not take possession of these surpluses [on anyone’s behalf]. However, I have noticed that neither the author of the Hilchoth Gedoloth nor all other scholars who counted the commandments [including the Rambam in his Sefer Hamitzvoth], have mentioned this as one of the negative commandments."

In addition He prescribed here the washing of feet because the priests performed the Service barefooted, and there are some people who have impurities and dirt on their feet.<br>By way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], these parts of the body had to be washed because the extremities of the person’s body are his hands and feet, for when the hands are upraised they are higher than the rest of the body, and the feet are the lowest point. They allude in the human form to the Ten Emanations, with the whole body between them, just as the Rabbis have said in Sefer Yetzirah:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">90</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sefer Yetzirah (Book of Creation), 6:4.</i> “He made a covenant with him [i.e., Abraham] between the ten fingers of his hands and the ten fingers of his feet, with the protrusive part of the tongue and with the protrusive part of the nakedness.” Therefore the ministers of the One on High were commanded to wash their hands and feet, this washing being for the sake of holiness, as Onkelos translated here, <i>l’rochtzah</i> (to wash): <i>l’kidush</i> (to sanctify).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">91</sup><i class=\"footnote\">But in all other places (such as Genesis 18:4) Onkelos renders the term <i>rochtzah</i> (washing) literally.</i> It is on the basis of the idea of this commandment that our Rabbis have instituted the washing of hands before prayer,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">92</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Berachoth 60b.</i> in order that one should direct one’s thoughts to this matter, just as in the uplifting of hands by the priests when blessing the people.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">93</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When reciting the Benediction for the washing of hands one must lift up the hands. This is comparable to the raising of the hands of the priests in order to bring down the blessings from on High; so also the washer raises his hands for that purpose.</i><br>It is the washing which is the essence of the commandment, but He commanded [the making of] the laver only in order that the water should be ready in it. Thus the absence of the laver does not invalidate the washing, neither is there any duty [to do the washing specifically from the laver]; thus on the Day of Atonement the High Priest washed his hands and feet from a golden jug<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">94</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yoma 43b.</i> which they made in his honor.

The commentators<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">95</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ibn Ezra quoting Rabbeinu Saadia Gaon.</i> — including Harav Rabbi Moshe [ben Maimon]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishneh Torah, <i>Hilchoth Klei Hamikdash</i>, 1:3: “<i>Mor</i> is the blood gathered up [in the abdomen] of a certain animal in the land of India known to all, which is used in perfumery.”</i> — have agreed that <i>mor</i> is that perfume which is called musk [an animal perfume].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">97</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Jastrow: <i>muskin</i> and <i>mor</i>.</i> But Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra objected to this interpretation, since [musk] is not a spice [as are <i>the sweet cinnamon</i> and <i>the sweet calamus</i> mentioned here in the same verse], even though it has a pleasing odor. Perhaps this is why Scripture separated it from the spices.” And then [Ibn Ezra] asked: “But is it not written, <i>I have gathered ‘mori’ (my myrrh)</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">98</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Song of Songs 5:1.</i> which shows that <i>mor</i> is something gathered [like spices], while those who bring musk say that it is a substance gathered in a glandular sac under the skin of the neck of the deer?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">99</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, this proves that <i>mor</i> is not musk as Saadia Gaon said, for the verse speaks of <i>mor</i> being gathered while musk is not “gathered.”</i> Moreover, the verse states, <i>and my hands dropped with myrrh</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">100</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Song of Songs 5:5.</i> [and musk does not drop]. But perhaps it does do so, due to its moistness.” [Thus far are Ibn Ezra’s words].<br>It is possible that we say that Scripture states <i>I have gathered ‘mori’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">98</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Song of Songs 5:1.</i> because <i>mor</i> is the blood gathered up in the abdomen of an animal of the hind species known in the land of India; when it walks between the shrubs on very hot days it scratches against the sac and the blood comes out in thickened mass, which is then gathered from the reed-grass. It states <i>and my hands dropped ‘mor,’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">100</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Song of Songs 5:5.</i> because Scripture imagines its odor to be such that one’s hands drop globules of water because of it.<br>Others<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">101</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Reference is to Rabbi Abraham ben David [Rabad] who commented on Rambam’s language (see Note 96): “My opinion does not accept this, that there should enter into sacred things the blood of any animal in the world, and all the more the blood of an unclean animal.”</i> have argued: how could there be included in the incense<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">102</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Among the eleven components of the incense was <i>‘mor’</i> (myrrh, cassia, spikenard etc.) (Kerithoth 6 a).</i> and the sacred oil the blood of an unclean animal? This too is no question, for that moisture gathered up in the animal because of its abundant blood, which drops from [the animal] whilst still alive, is not susceptible to uncleanness, nor is it repulsive.<br>The word <i>dror</i> they<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">103</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R’dak, in his Book of Roots, under the root of <i>dror</i>.</i> have explained to be of the expression, <i>and ye shall proclaim ‘dror’ (liberty)</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">104</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 25:10.</i> here meaning that it should be free from any imitation or adulteration. Perhaps we might say that Scripture requires it to be gathered when free, meaning that it should be taken from that deer whilst it is free, wandering between the beds of spices and enjoying itself at will, because once it is captured and held in the possession of man, it produces but little <i>mor</i> (musk) and it does not have such a pleasant odor. This is clear.<br>Yet despite all this [that we have written to justify the opinion of Rabbeinu Saadia Gaon and Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon, that <i>mor</i> mentioned here is musk], it appears to me from the words of our Rabbis that <i>mor</i> is not musk, for they have said in Midrash Chazita:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">105</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shir Hashirim Rabbah 4:29. See Vol. I, p. 292, Note 73, for explanation of the name “Chazita.”</i> “<i>Mor</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">106</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Song of Songs 4:14.</i> means <i>inmirinon</i>” [an unguent scented with Arabian myrtle], while musk is so called even in the language of the Sages, just as it is said in Tractate Berachoth:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">107</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Berachoth 43a.</i> [“Over all spices put on coals one recites the Benediction: ‘Blessed… Who createst diverse kinds of spices’], except over musk, because it is derived from an animal.” In the Yerushalmi there<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">108</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yerushalmi Berachoth VI, 6.</i> they likewise say, [with respect to this Benediction]: “excepting <i>muskin</i>,” and the author of the Aruch<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">109</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Nathan ben Yechiel of Rome [flourished in the middle of the eleventh century] was a contemporary of Rashi. His work the “Aruch” is not only a complete dictionary of Talmudic and Midrashic language but is also a veritable storehouse of explanations of Rabbinic texts. It is thus both a dictionary and commentary. It has had a lasting influence on Jewish learning. — The particular reference here is to the Aruch, under the term: <i>mushk</i>.</i> wrote that it is also so called in Greek. In Midrash Chazita it furthermore says:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">110</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shir Hashirim Rabbah 1:58.</i> “<i>My beloved is unto me a bag of ‘hamor’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">111</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Song of Songs 1:13.</i> — this refers to Abraham.

Just as this <i>mor</i> exudes only through the fire, so Abraham’s deeds were not known until he was thrown in the fiery furnace.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">113</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Vol. I, p. 160.</i> And just as with this <i>mor</i> [we see that] whoever gathers it with his hands develops bad sores, so did Abraham cause himself to be distressed and afflicted with suffering” [for the sake of his love of G-d.] Now the musk exudes its odor [spontaneously], without being put upon the flame! Moreover, we have been taught [in a Mishnah]:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">114</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mikvaoth 9:5.</i> “These interpose in vessels:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">115</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When immersing an unclean vessel in an Immersion-pool to be cleansed, for the immersion to be valid there must be nothing interposing between the body’s surface and the water of the pool.</i> pitch and <i>mor</i> etc. on a packsaddle. Rabban<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">116</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The title “Rabban” [instead of “Rabbi”] signifies that he was the <i>Nasi</i> (Prince) of the Sanhedrin.</i> Shimon ben Gamaliel says: [They interpose only] if they are as big as an Italian <i>issar</i> [a Roman coin].” And it further teaches there:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">117</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mikvaoth 9:7.</i> “This is the general principle: Anything about which a person is particular, interposes [and invalidates the immersion]; anything about which he is not particular that does not interpose.” Now musk is not something which sticks [to a vessel or to a garment] so that it should interpose [and invalidate the immersion, and so, if <i>mor</i> is musk, why does the Mishnah state that it does interpose]! And even if perhaps they fix it in such a way that it does attach to vessels, a person is not particular about it, so that it should interpose even on a packsaddle! Moreover, the verse <i>‘mor va’aholoth k’tzioth’ are all thy garments</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">118</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 45:9.</i> [Yonathan ben Uziel] translated: <i>‘mura,’ aloe-wood and cassia</i>. [Thus it is clear that <i>mor</i> is not musk, for <i>mura</i> is myrrh.]<br>It is likely that <i>mor</i> is so called in Arabic as there are diverse kinds of it — <i>mur achmar ve’abitz</i>. It is used for incense, and when burned produces a sweet odor. Thus all languages — Hebrew, Aramaic, and also Arabic — are alike in the usage of this term. And in the language of the Agadah [quoted above]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">119</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the text from the Midrash Chazita, at Note 105.</i> — be it Persian or Greek<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">120</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Kohut’s Aruch Hashalem [and in Jastrow’s Dictionary] <i>inmirinon</i> is explained as a word of Greek origin.</i> — it is a similar expression: <i>inmirinon</i>. In Latin as well it is called <i>myrrha</i>. The consensus of the languages on this term would thus indicate that [the <i>mor</i> of the Torah] is indeed that substance [called myrrh or its equivalent in the above-mentioned languages — and not the musk mentioned by Saadia Gaon], and it is counted among the spices.<br>And as to that which the Rabbis said above,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">121</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the text from Midrash Chazita mentioned above at Note 110.</i> that “the <i>mor</i> is the chief of all kinds of spices,” they mean that [in the verse before us where the spices are listed] the Torah mentioned it first, or it may mean that for aromatic purposes it is the best of all spices. Possibly amongst its diverse kinds there may be a still more aromatic one, and that is called <i>dror</i>, and the one who gathers it [as the Midrash quoted above said], develops bad sores on his hands, because it is bitter as wormwood. And the Rabbis have taught in the Sifra:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">122</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifra, <i>Vayikra Chova</i> 22:7.</i> “Things which cannot be recognized, such as a mixture of water into wine, or of gum in myrrh,” for this is how they falsify the myrrh, by putting into it a certain gum which resembles it, called <i>tzemeg</i> in Arabic. This is why He said <i>mor dror</i>, meaning that it be clear of any of these usual adulterations. It is possible that the term <i>dror</i> always indicates “clean” (or “pure”). Similarly, <i>and ye shall proclaim ‘dror’ throughout the land unto all the inhabitants thereof</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">104</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 25:10.</i> means that all people of the land be “clean” from servitude, and from all subjection attaching to their persons or lands, similar to the expression, <i>and the owner of the ox shall be quit</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">123</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 21:18.</i> And as to that which Scripture says, <i>And my hands dropped with ‘mor’, and my fingers with flowing ‘mor,’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">100</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Song of Songs 5:5.</i> it is possible that the meaning is as follows: “and my hands dropped with <i>oil</i> of myrrh,” for it is customary to apply it also to the hands in order to make them gentle and soft, as it is written, <i>six months with oil of myrrh</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">124</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Esther 2:12.</i> which our Rabbis have explained to be: “the oil of olives that have not reached a third of their growth, because that makes the hair fall out and improves the complexion.” And the purport thereof is that that oil was prepared with myrrh and therefore it was so called [“oil of myrrh”]. This then is the meaning of <i>‘natphu’ (dropped with) ‘mor’</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">100</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Song of Songs 5:5.</i> [the dropping being not from the myrrh but from the oil put in it]. I hold this to be the <i>inmirinon</i> mentioned in the Midrash [quoted above,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">105</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shir Hashirim Rabbah 4:29. See Vol. I, p. 292, Note 73, for explanation of the name “Chazita.”</i> namely that it is identical with <i>the oil of myrrh</i> mentioned in the Scroll of Esther], for similarly the Rabbis in the Yerushalmi<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">125</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yerushalmi Demai I, 3.</i> call “oil of <i>v’rad</i>” (roses): <i>vardinun</i> [and in the same way they called “the oil of <i>mor</i>” — <i>inmirinon</i>]. Such is the customary usage for names of oils in the various languages of the nations. [Finally,] it is also possible that they extract oil from the myrrh, as is done with gum mastic and other kinds of gums. Thus it is correct to call it “myrrh,” and “oil of myrrh.”",

But this is not the opinion of our Rabbis.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">142</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For according to the Talmud (Kerithoth 5 b) every High Priest who would be appointed was to be anointed with this oil, as were also some of the kings. Generally an heir to the throne of Israel did not have to be anointed, though in order to avoid disputes over the royal succession [as was the case with Solomon] anointing was resorted to. See further on this topic “The Commandments,” Vol. I, p. 45.</i><br>And I say that [the opinion of our Rabbis is borne out by the language of the verse]. For Scripture states, <i>This shall be a holy anointing oil unto Me throughout your generations</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">143</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 31.</i> and it would have been correct if it were to say instead, “This shall be a holy anointing oil for Aaron and his sons throughout their generations,” just as He said in the case of the garments, <i>And the holy garments of Aaron shall be for his sons after him;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">144</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 29:29.</i> or that He say, “And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and sanctify them, that they may minister unto Me, and it shall be a statute forever to them throughout their generations.” But now that He mentioned only them, [<i>And Aaron and his sons thou shalt anoint</i>] and then continued by saying that it should not be put upon any <i>zar</i>, it could mean that [the prohibition extends] to all people [even High Priests after Aaron] except those mentioned specifically [i.e., Aaron and his sons] ! Similarly He said, <i>Upon the flesh of man shall it not be poured</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">145</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 32.</i> [which might be taken to mean upon anyone’s flesh — even that of the High Priests after Aaron], and yet Scripture explicitly states, <i>And the anointed priest that shall be in his</i> [Aaron’s] <i>stead, from among his sons!</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">146</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 6:15. This shows that it is impossible to say that the High Priests after Aaron should not be anointed with this oil. And if so, the question appears why did Scripture use here language which might indicate the opposite, as explained above?

It is for this reason that kings and High Priests were anointed with this oil, for both of them are “the anointed ones of G-d.” Thus it is written, <i>I have found David My servant; with My holy oil have I anointed him</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">147</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 89:21.</i> — meaning, with the oil which is <i>the holy anointing oil unto Me</i>. And the meaning of the verse, <i>Upon the flesh of man shall it not be poured</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">145</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 32.</i> is as an admonition to all men [even to Aaron and his sons after they have been anointed with it], since He did not say, “upon the flesh of a <i>zar</i> shall it not be poured.” Thus the purport thereof is that he [Moses] is to pour of the oil upon Aaron’s head in order to anoint him, and then he is to anoint also his sons, but he is not to pour this oil upon any man, even upon the anointed priests, merely as people apply good oils to their bodies in order to scent themselves with hands soaked in oil, after bathing, something like it is said, <i>Wash thyself and anoint thee;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">148</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ruth 3:3.</i> <i>Then I washed thee with water… and I anointed thee with oil</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">149</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 16:9.</i> This is the plain meaning of the verse and its intention.

Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented that by way of the plain meaning of Scripture the interpretation of the verse is: “take unto you the aromatics which are stacte, onycha and galbanum; these spices [you are to take], and pure frankincense with them.” But it is not correct that Scripture should just repeat the word <i>samim</i> [in such a short verse], for it is not the normal way of Scripture to repeat words unless there is some lengthy interpolation<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">151</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ramban above, 4:9.</i> or in order to indicate that it is a continuing thing.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">152</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ramban above, 15:6.</i> The truth is as our Rabbis have said,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">153</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kerithoth 6b.</i> that the second word <i>samim</i> refers to other aromatics.<br>Now Rashi wrote: “<i>‘Samim’</i> — the least number of aromatics implied by the plural form of this word is two. <i>Stacte, and onycha, and galbanum</i>, make together five. <i>‘Samim’</i> adds a similar number to those already prescribed, thus making ten. <i>With frankincense</i>, makes eleven [altogether].”<br>But one wonders! Why did Scripture not mention them explicitly? Perhaps Scripture is saying: “<i>Take unto thee aromatics, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum</i>, many <i>aromatics with pure frankincense</i>,” thus insisting only on these four spices, for they were the ones that caused <i>the cloud of</i> the smoke of <i>the incense</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">154</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 16:13.</i> to ascend; but He commanded that they add to them many other aromatic spices in order that the pillars of smoke [of the incense] should be fragrant. This is why He did not explain [in the case of the incense] the weight of each component [as He did in the case of the Oil of Anointment], nor how much of it should be burnt [daily], since He insisted only that these four [spices mentioned] should be alike [in weight], and that he should add to them other good spices for the burning. The reason for this is that just as He had said with reference to the Oil of Anointment that they make it in accordance with the art of the perfumer, and did not specify how it was to be made but relied upon it [that they knew how to make it], so He said in respect of this incense that he take an equal weight of these four [mentioned] aromatics, and add to them other aromatics and make out of all the components one incense, done <i>after the art of the perfumer</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">155</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 35.</i> [which implies by] using spices known to blend well with these [four] and by preparing them through the process by which they are usually prepared. It is of this incense that he had to put before the Testimony,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">156</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 36.</i> so that its pillar of smoke should go up, as was the custom to put spices on coals before kings. In the same way He shortened the account of how to make the incense, and did not mention it when He referred to all the other spices. In a similar vein the Rabbis have said in the Gemara:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">153</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kerithoth 6b.</i> “Resh Lakish said: What is the meaning of the word <i>k’toreth?</i> It is something which circles and rises.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">157</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word <i>k’toreth</i> (incense) is thus of the root <i>kateir</i> (surrounding, circling), because the smoke of the burning incense circles and rises.</i> Thus the Torah only commanded in connection with the incense to use those spices the smoke of which circles and rises, in a way similar to the art of the perfumers. Perhaps it was explained to Moses on Sinai by word of mouth which spices are best for that purpose, as well as the whole process of making the incense, for the process of making the Oil of Anointment was likewise explained to him in this manner, even though Scripture made it dependent upon the art of the perfumers. Or it may be that He insisted only on those [four spices] expressly mentioned in the verse, commanding that he perfume them with other spices after the art of the perfumers. And so the Rabbis have said in Midrash Chazit:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">158</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shir Hashirim Rabbah 3:7.</i> “The Sages investigated and found no more fitting components for the incense than those eleven spices.”<br>It is also possible that <i>samim</i> (aromatics) and <i>b’samim</i> (spices) denote the same thing, as I have mentioned,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">159</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above 25:6.</i> and these three components<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">160</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., <i>Nataph ushcheileth v’chel’bnah’</i> These are generally translated as being various kinds of fragrant spices: “stacte, and onycha, and galbanum.” But Ramban will now question the two terms [stacte and galbanum].</i> which He specified are not spices, for <i>‘nataph’ and ‘chel’bnah’</i> are saps, and <i>shcheileth</i> is the onycha which comes from the ocean.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">161</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Onycha… supposed to be the operculum of a marine gastropod (Dictionary).</i> And Scripture states: “Take unto you the mentioned <i>samim</i> [i.e., all components mentioned above<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">162</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verses 23-24.</i> in the preparation of the Oil of Anointment — namely, the flowing myrrh, the cinnamon, the calamus, and the cassia — as all these <i>b’samim</i> also went into the incense, as will be explained], and the <i>nataph</i>, and <i>shcheileth</i> and the <i>chel’bnah</i>, and other <i>samim</i> [in addition, as will be explained], with pure frankincense, and make of them a perfumed incense, after the art of the perfumer.” For the <i>samim</i> mentioned above in connection with the Oil [of Anointment] — flowing myrrh, cinnamon, and cassia — also went into the incense. And the <i>knei bosem</i> [mentioned among the components of the oil]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">163</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 23. Generally translated “sweet calamus.”</i> is in my opinion the <i>kiluphah</i> mentioned by the Sages,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">164</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kerithoth 6a.</i> called <i>dratzini</i> in Arabic, and so also in the language of the Gemara,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">165</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shabbath 65a. In connection with what is taught in the Mishnah there that a woman may go out on the Sabbath with “anything that she puts in her mouth” [to have a good breath], the Gemara explained, “such as <i>dartzuna</i>,” which Rashi explained as “cinnamon.”</i> which is a cane [of sweet spices] resembling reeds. And the <i>samim</i> which He commanded to add [to all those mentioned above] are: spikenard and saffron and the costus, in accordance with that which the Sages have taught.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">164</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kerithoth 6a.</i> Perhaps Scripture only insisted on these nine<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">166</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Nine.” The reading should be “eight” (as explained above): the four components mentioned in the making of the Oil of Anointment [myrrh, cinnamon, <i>kanah</i> — the cane of sweet spice — and cassia], and the four expressly stated in the making of the incense [<i>nataph, shcheileth, chel’bnah</i>, and frankincense]. With the three components [spikenard, saffron, and costus] added by the second word <i>samim</i> they form the eleven components of the incense.</i> which He mentioned, but was not particular as to [the nature of] those included by means of the repetition of the word <i>samim</i>, except inasmuch as they are to be sweet, so that they may make a perfumed incense. Thus He shortened the account of the making thereof, as well as of the weights of the other components [except for the four mentioned in the making of the oil, where the weights are prescribed],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">162</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verses 23-24.</i> because He commanded that they make it <i>after the art of the perfumer</i>.<br>It appears to me that the Sages chose three spices [spikenard, saffron, and costus] because they are mentioned in the Song of Songs: <i>Spikenard and saffron… and ‘oholoth,’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">167</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Song of Songs 4:14.</i> which is the costus. Its name is in the plural from [<i>oholoth</i>] because there are two kinds of it, the sweet and the bitter. Now Scripture mentioned there, <i>calamus and cinnamon… frankincense</i>, and <i>myrrh</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">167</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Song of Songs 4:14.</i> together with these three [spikenard, saffron, and costus], and then said, <i>with ‘all’ the chief spices</i>, so as to include cassia. Thus you have there all<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">168</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., eight components: spikenard, saffron, costus, calamus, cinnamon, frankincense, myrrh, and cassia. Three more will follow. Thus Ramban found the eleven components of the incense mentioned in the Song of Songs.</i> the components of the incense. Now before that Scripture mentioned there: <i>‘k’pharim im n’radim’ (henna with spikenard plants)</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">169</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Song of Songs 4:13.</i> This is to include <i>nataph ushcheileth v’chel’bnah</i> [mentioned here in the verse] which are saps, for <i>k’pharim</i> is of the root <i>‘v’chapharta othah’ (and thou shalt pitch it)</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">170</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 6:14.</i> it being an adhesive sap. And the Targum Yerushalmi rendered: <i>myrrh and ‘oholoth’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">167</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Song of Songs 4:14.</i> — [pure myrrh and] <i>aksi lalu’an</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">171</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“A tree of bitter aloe wood.” Ramban will further on explain that <i>aksi</i> means tree. See also Jastrow under the term <i>aksiloliyon</i>.</i> which is that precious tree called in Latin <i>linga lubin</i> as <i>aksi</i> means “tree” in Aramaic, and <i>lalu’an</i> is the name of the tree. In Greek it is actually so called: <i>aksiluin</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">172</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Jastrow (<i>ibid.</i>) for the Greek term.</i> and so it is called in Arabic — <i>al urtib</i>. But Onkelos rendered: <i>‘ka’aholim’ planted of the Eternal</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">173</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 24:6.</i> — <i>k’busmaya</i> (as spices), without specifying a particular name [for <i>oholim</i>, as did the Targum Yerushalmi mentioned above].",
                    "NATAPH’ — is <i>tzori</i> (balsam). Now in Rashi’s commentary it is written: “The balm itself is called <i>triga</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">174</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In our Rashi: <i>theriaque</i>. — To this term Ramban will object, since a theriac is an electuary [a medical compound] composed of many ingredients.</i> but because it is merely the sap which ‘drips’ from the wood of the balsam it is called <i>nataph</i> (dripping).” But I do not know whether this is the scribe’s mistake, or the one who so told Rashi misinformed him. For theriac [the <i>triga</i> mentioned by Rashi] is not one ingredient but is a compound of many ingredients, containing leaven and honey, the flesh of forbidden animals and reptiles, for the powder of dried scorpions and the flesh of the viper go into it, this being the reason why it is so called [theriac], for “poison” in Greek is called <i>theriac</i>. So also in the language of the Talmud:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">175</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shabbath 109b.</i> “<i>Torkai</i> (stung by) a serpent.” Similarly this compound is mentioned in the language [of the Rabbis]:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">176</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nedarim 41b.</i> “as theriac is good for the whole body.” And Heaven forbid that there should be in the incense the flesh of forbidden animals and reptiles, leaven and honey, for it is written, <i>for ye shall make no leaven, nor any honey, smoke as an offering made by fire unto the Eternal</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">177</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 2:11.</i> Rather, the <i>tzori</i> is the oily sap which drips from the balsam tree, called in the language of the Sages <i>k’taph</i>. It is this which we have been taught:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">164</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kerithoth 6a.</i> “Rabban<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">116</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The title “Rabban” [instead of “Rabbi”] signifies that he was the <i>Nasi</i> (Prince) of the Sanhedrin.</i> Shimon ben Gamaliel says: The <i>tzori</i> [required for the incense] was the sap which exuded from the <i>k’taph</i> (balsam) tree.” Perhaps it is called <i>k’taph</i> (plucking off) because they break off its branches on days in the hot season, and the balm runs down from the place where it is broken. In the Gemara of Chapter <i>Bameh Madlikin</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">178</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“With what may they light” [the Sabbath lamp]? — Shabbath 26a.</i> it is stated: “Rabbi Shimon ben Eleazar says: We do not light [the Sabbath lamp] with <i>tzori</i>, and so did Rabbi Shimon ben Eleazar<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">179</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Ramban manuscripts: “Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel.” So also in some manuscripts of the Talmud (see Dikdukei Sofrim, Shabbath, p. 48 Note 1).</i> say: The <i>tzori</i> [required for the incense] was the sap exuding from the balsam tree.” And there in the Gemara<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">180</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 25b.</i> the Sages explained the reason [why that balm is not used for the Sabbath lamp], because its fragrance spreads and he may come to use it as food [and taking off oil from a burning lamp is considered the same as extinguishing it]. Thus it is clear that the <i>tzori</i> mentioned [for the incense] is that good oil mentioned [in the above Gemara].<br>And I wonder! For Onkelos translated: <i>‘n’choth’ (spicery) ‘u’tzri’ (and balm) and labdanum</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">181</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 37:25.</i> — <i>sh’aph u’ktaph</i>. Similarly he rendered: <i>a little ‘tzori’ (balm)</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">182</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 43:11.</i> — <i>k’taph</i>. But <i>nataph</i> [here in this verse] he translated <i>n’tupha</i>, and did not translate it as he did in the case of the word <i>tzori!</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">183</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For since Onkelos translated (in Genesis 37:25) the Hebrew <i>tzori</i> as the Aramaic <i>k’taph</i>, he should have translated likewise here the Hebrew <i>nataph</i>, for as said above <i>nataph</i> is <i>tzori</i>, and so why did he translate it as <i>k’topha</i>?</i> And Yonathan [ben Uziel] translated everywhere <i>tzori</i> as <i>sh’aph</i>, which is a term for an anointing oil in the language of the Talmud, such as in their saying:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">184</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chullin 111b.</i> “[for him whose eyes hurt] they make <i>shipha</i> (an ointment of various components) in a vessel,” the word <i>shipha</i> being short of the letter <i>ayin</i>, which would make it <i>she’ipha</i>. A similar example is:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">185</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Beitzah 16a.</i> “<i>D’sha’yeiph</i> (he anoints) him with the same kind he gave him” to eat. Here too, the word <i>d’sha’yeiph</i> is like <i>d’sha’iph</i> [with the letter <i>ayin</i>].<br>It appears from their opinions<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">186</sup><i class=\"footnote\">From Onkelos who translated (in Genesis 37:25) <i>tzori</i> as <i>k’taph</i>, and from Yonathan who translated it as <i>sh’aph</i>.</i> that both the balsam tree and its fruit are called <i>tzori</i> in the Sacred Language, just like <i>t’einah</i> (fig), <i>rimon</i> (pomegranate), <i>ethrog</i>, and many other names like them. The term <i>n’choth</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">181</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 37:25.</i> is thus, according to them, [Onkelos and Yonathan], a generic name for all notable and fragrant oils. That is why Scripture states, <i>and he</i> [Hezekiah] <i>showed them all the house ‘n’chothoh’</i> (of his treasure),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">187</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Kings 20:13.</i> because the treasure-house where the precious oil is stored is called by that name, seeing that it is the choicest of all treasure, and there in fact it is also written, <i>and the precious oil</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">187</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Kings 20:13.</i> Therefore Onkelos said in the case of the present that Jacob sent to Joseph, that they brought him <i>sh’aph</i> [which is the Aramaic translation for the Hebrew <i>n’chot</i>],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">182</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 43:11.</i> which is the term for that notable oil. And they further brought [in the present for Joseph] from the branches of the <i>tzori</i>-tree called <i>k’taph</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">188</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This explains Onkelos’ translation in Genesis 43:11.</i> In other places where Scripture mentions <i>tzori</i> alone, speaking of it as a beneficial medicine — such as in the verse, <i>Is there no ‘tzori’ in Gilead?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">189</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 8:22.</i> — Yonathan translates it as referring to the oil called <i>sh’aph</i>. Onkelos translated [here] <i>nataph</i> as <i>netupha</i>, which is an oil called by that name because it “drips” from the broken branches. There is no justification here to translate <i>nataph</i> as <i>sh’aph</i>, for the incense did not contain any ointment.<br>Now I have seen that Harav Rabbi Moshe [ben Maimon]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">190</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishneh Torah, <i>Hilchoth Klei Hamikdash</i> 2:4.</i> included in the incense the bark of a tree called in Arabic <i>od balsan</i>. From this it would appear that he was of the opinion that Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel who said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">164</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kerithoth 6a.</i> “The <i>tzori</i> [required for the incense] was the sap which exuded from the <i>k’taph</i>-tree” thereby intended to differ with the Sages [who counted the <i>tzori</i> among the eleven components of the incense], and to say instead that <i>tzori</i> was not one of the ingredients of the incense, since <i>tzori</i> is nothing but a sap, and it was not the sap [of the <i>k’taph</i>] that was put into the incense, but the [bark of the] <i>k’taph</i> itself."

                    "MEMULACH’ (SEASONED WITH SALT), PURE AND HOLY. This means that it be seasoned with salt of Sodom, just as the Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">164</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kerithoth 6a.</i> “Of salt of Sodom, the fourth part of a <i>kab</i>.” Onkelos translated [<i>memulach</i> as] <i>m’areiv</i> (mixed together). By this he intended to say that <i>memulach</i> means “rubbed out” — that the ingredients should all be so well-ground and mixed so thoroughly together, that their identity is “rubbed out” and none of the [individual] ingredients can be recognized. This is of the expression: <i>For the heavens ‘nimlochu’ (shall vanish away) like smoke</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">191</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 51:6.</i> Similarly: <i>‘u’vloyei m’lachim’</i> (and worn rags);<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">192</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 38:11.</i> <i>A fruitful land ‘limleichah’ (into a salt waste)</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">193</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 107:34.</i> These are all expressions of destruction and annihilation.<br>And Rashi explained that the term <i>memluach</i> means that it be thoroughly mixed together in the grinding of the ingredients one with another. To this interpretation Rashi brought proof from the verse similar in meaning: <i>‘malachayich’ (thy mariners) and thy pilots</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">194</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 27:27.</i> who are so called “because they turn over the water with the oars when they propel the ship, like a person who stirs up beaten eggs with a spoon in order to mix them thoroughly.”<br>In my opinion mariners are called <i>malachim</i> [of the root <i>melach</i> — salt] because they know the “taste” of the sea, as if they could feel if it is “salty” or “sweet;” that is to say, they know when it will be sweet and pleasant for those travelling by sea, and when it will be bad and bitter for them. It is not those who hold the oars [propelling the ship] who are called <i>malachim</i> [as Rashi said], for it is written on Tyre, <i>The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were thy ‘shotim’ (rowers);</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">195</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 8.</i> <i>The elders of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee thy calkers; all the ships of the sea ‘u’malacheyhem’ (and their mariners) were in thee</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">196</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 9.</i> For it is the older captains who know the sea that are called <i>malachim</i>. And it is further written, <i>And all that handle the oar, ‘malachim’ (the mariners), and all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships, they shall stand upon the land</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">197</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 29.</i> Thus three categories are mentioned: those that handle the oar, the mariners, and the pilots [which proves that <i>malachim</i> — the mariners — are not those that handle the oar].<br>Similarly, <i>a fruitful land ‘limleichah’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">193</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 107:34.</i> means “to a salt land,” for in a salt land nothing will grow, just as is written of Sodom, <i>The whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and a burning, that it is not sown, nor beareth</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">198</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 29:22.</i> and it is further written, <i>and he sowed it with salt</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">199</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Judges 9:45.</i> It is possible that the letter <i>lamed</i> is redundant in the verse, <i>for the heavens ‘nimlochu’ like smoke</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">191</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 51:6.</i> the intent thereof being as in the word <i>nimchu</i> (erased), which would make it similar to these cases: <i>ba’l'umim;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">200</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 44:15.

                    "AND THE GARMENTS OF ‘HA’SROD.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">214</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi explains it as “the garments of net-work” [with which the sacred vessels were covered during the journeyings]. Ramban will differ with this interpretation.</i> I do not know why He did not command the making of these garments at the beginning, as He did concerning all the [rest of the] work of the Tabernacle and the garments of Aaron and his sons, for it would have been proper that He say to Moses, “and thou shalt make cloth of blue-purple to cover with it the ark,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">215</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 4:6.</i> and a red-purple cloth to cover with it the altar,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">216</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 13.</i> and a cloth of scarlet to cover with it the table,” and now when charging Moses about those who were to make these things, He should have included these garments with the rest of the work. Perhaps there was no insistence on how they were to be made, and they could have made these garments of <i>srod</i> of one kind alone, but they made them of blue-purple, red-purple and scarlet. They did not want to make them of linen, as that is not distinguished, as are those other colors. After they made them, G-d willed that the blue-purple cloth be for the ark, the red-purple for the altar, and the scarlet for the table. Therefore, it was sufficient to command them in brief [here] when He gave the command about those who were to do all the work, for these <i>garments of ‘ha’srod’</i> were to be made according to their understanding.<br>Now it is not befitting that a garment made to cover [the sacred vessels] should have many holes in it, as Rashi has said. Rather, the word <i>ha’srod</i> is of the term <i>sarid</i> (a lone survivor), because all these garments were of one kind,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">217</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e. wool, excepting that they were colored differently: blue-purple, red-purple, and scarlet.</i> as Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra said.<br>All this I have written in accordance with the line of thought of Rashi. <i>Yet all this availeth me nothing</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">218</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Esther 5:13.</i> For what meaning is there in the Holy One, blessed be He, saying to Moses that they should make “garments of <i>kela</i>,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">219</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew word <i>kla’im</i> (hangings) (above 27:9) Onkelos translates <i>s’radin</i>. Similarly he translates the Hebrew word <i>michbar</i> (grate) (<i>ibid.</i>, Verse 4) as <i>s’rada</i>. On the basis of these translations of Onkelos, Rashi suggests here that the word <i>ha’srod</i> is an Aramaic term, which means “garments of net-work,” because they were made with many holes. — It is with reference to this basis for Rashi’s explanation that Ramban says, “garments of <i>kela</i>.”</i> or “garments of <i>s’ridah</i>,” without explaining to him how many of them there should be, two or a hundred, how long and wide they should be, and why they should be made altogether, since the matter cannot be understood at all from this communication [stated here]? Moreover, why are they mentioned always before the garments of Aaron?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">220</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the verse before us: <i>And the garments of ‘ha’srod,’ and the holy garments for Aaron</i> etc. — Likewise further, 35:19, and 39:41.</i> Besides, what is the meaning of the phrase, <i>the garments of ‘ha’srod’, for ministering in the holy place</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">221</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 35:19.</i> for this seems to refer to the sacrificial rites in the holy place, just as He says, <i>or when they come near to the altar to minister</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">222</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 30:20.</i> in the holy place. Similarly, <i>even he who cometh into the Tent of Meeting to minister in the holy place</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">223</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 29:30.</i> does not refer to outer work, or the carrying of the holy vessels. Furthermore, it is written, <i>and they will make all that I commanded thee: the Tent of Meeting</i> etc., <i>and the garments of ‘ha’srod’</i> etc., <i>and the incense of sweet spices; according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">224</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verses 6-11.</i> But He had not commanded him before about <i>the garments of ‘ha’srod’</i> at all!<br>What appears from the words of our Rabbis is that <i>the garments of ‘ha’srod’</i> are the actual garments of the priesthood. This is mentioned in Tractate Yoma.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">225</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yoma 72 a-b. “What is the meaning of the verse, <i>the garments of ‘ha’srod’ for ministering in the holy place</i> (further 35:19)? If not for the garments of the priesthood [which are worn during the service which brings atonement to Israel], there would not have been left a survivor [a <i>sarid</i>] of Israel’s enemies.” The final expression is a euphemism. But the whole quotation shows that <i>the garments of ‘ha’srod’</i> refer to the actual garments of the priests.</i> If that is so, it is correct that we translate <i>the garments of ‘ha’srod’</i> as “the garments of uniqueness,” that is to say, the garments which when worn designate the outstanding one of the people, <i>the highest among his brethren</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">226</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 21:10.</i> Similarly, <i>‘u’basridim’ whom the Eternal shall call</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">227</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joel 3:5.</i> means the remnants of those who have survived, [the word being] of the root, <i>escape ‘v’sarid’ (and remain)</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">228</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 44:14.</i> [<i>The garments of ‘ha’srod’</i>] thus allude to the garments of Aaron, which are so called [‘unique’] because only one of the generation may wear them — Aaron in his lifetime, and after him <i>the priest that is highest… upon whose head the anointing oil is poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">226</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 21:10.</i> And Scripture always mentions Aaron’s garments in a way of honor, as it says: <i>for splendor and for beauty;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">229</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 28:2.</i> <i>holy garments;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">230</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 4.</i> <i>the golden plate, the holy crown</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">231</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 8:9.</i> It is for this reason that they are called <i>the garments of ‘ha’srod’</i> — garments of royalty. This is the meaning of the verse, <i>And the garments of ‘ha’srod’</i> (the High Priest) <i>to minister in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest</i>, Scripture thus reverting [in the second half of the verse] to explain [that the garments of <i>ha’srod</i> are for Aaron]. Similarly it is mentioned in the section beginning, <i>And they brought the Tabernacle unto Moses</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">232</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 39:33. In Verse 41 there it is stated: <i>the garments of ‘ha’srod'… the holy garments for Aaron the priest</i>.</i> And the reason why in this section of <i>See, I have called by name</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">233</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 2.</i> it says, <i>And the garments of ‘ha’srod,’ ‘and’ the holy garments for Aaron the priest</i> [when the second half of the verse should have been without the connective <i>vav</i> which signifies “and,” since, as explained, it is in apposition to the first<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">234</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See also Note 232; further in 39:41 the connective “and” is not used by Scripture. The question then appears why is it mentioned here.</i>], is to indicate that these garments are superior in two qualities: they are garments of <i>ha’srod</i> [the High Priesthood], and they are garments of holiness. This is in order to tell us that only the outstanding one among the people should wear them, [and only] when he comes in to minister in the holy place. And seeing that He did not mention here the phrase, <i>to minister in the holy place</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">223</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 29:30.</i> He added in explanation that they are garments of <i>s’rod</i> and garments of holiness. Besides, there are many cases in Scripture where a redundant <i>vav</i> occurs. And the reason why Scripture states, <i>And of the blue-purple, and red-purple, and scarlet, they made garments of ‘srod,’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">235</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 39:1. And if, as explained above, <i>srod</i> is a term referring to the garments of the High Priest, why then does the verse not mention the linen, of which the garments of Aaron were also made? This is because etc.</i> is because it comes to explain <i>These are the accounts of the Tabernacle</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">236</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 38:21.</i> giving an accounting — because of their importance — of the gold, silver and brass, how much of them the Israelites brought and what they did with them; therefore it then said afterwards that <i>of the blue-purple, and the red-purple, and scarlet</i> which were brought to them they made <i>the garments of ‘srod’</i> (the High Priest), neither more nor less. Thus it did not mention the linen because it is not as costly a matter [as the rest]. Perhaps they brought so much [of the linen] that it was left over [and therefore Scripture did not mention it]. Then Scripture there refers back and explains [what they did with the blue-purple, the red-purple, etc.] and says, <i>and they made the holy garments for Aaron, as the Eternal commanded Moses</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">235</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 39:1. And if, as explained above, <i>srod</i> is a term referring to the garments of the High Priest, why then does the verse not mention the linen, of which the garments of Aaron were also made? This is because etc.</i> <i>And he made the ephod of gold</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">237</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 39:2.</i> and then finished the [whole] subject."

                    "ACH’ (BUT) YE SHALL KEEP MY SABBATHS. “Even though you may be anxious<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">238</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Our Rashi adds: “and alert.”</i> to do the work promptly, do not set aside the Sabbath on its account. All [Scriptural expressions containing] the words <i>ach</i> (but) or <i>rak</i> (only), intimate limiting qualifications; [in this case] it is to exclude the Sabbath from [the days on which] the work of the Tabernacle may be done.” This is Rashi’s language. But I have not been able to explain it. For according to the method used by our Rabbis to interpret the words <i>ach</i> (but) and <i>rak</i> (only), it should limit the scope of Sabbath-observance [and permit the work of the Tabernacle on the Sabbath], for the limiting qualifications [of <i>ach</i> and <i>rak</i>] everywhere apply to the subject of the commandment itself [and since the verse here speaks of Sabbath-observance, the word <i>ach</i> should be restricting its application]. Thus if we are to interpret [and apply] the limiting nature of the word <i>ach</i> to the subject of the work of the Tabernacle, it should follow that it is allowed to be done on the Sabbath! Rather, the limiting nature of the word <i>ach</i> here applies to circumcision [on the eighth day of the child], or to the saving of human life, and similar instances, [to tell us] that they set aside the Sabbath. And so the Rabbis said in Tractate Yoma:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">239</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yerushalmi Yoma VIII, 5.</i> “And whence do we know that even in a doubt whether life is in danger, the Sabbath may be set aside? Rabbi Abohu said in the name of Rabbi Yochanan: <i>‘Ach’ ye shall keep My Sabbaths</i> — [the word <i>ach</i>] has a limiting qualification.” And the reason why the work of the Tabernacle does not override the Sabbath [is not on account of the word <i>ach</i>, but] because He warned [about keeping the Sabbath] here [right next to the subject of the making of the Tabernacle, thus indicating that the Sabbath is not to be set aside on account of it]. And in line with the plain meaning of Scripture the verse states as follows: “You shall do the work of the Tent of Meeting, but My Sabbaths you shall keep forever.” And in the Torath Kohanim<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">240</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifra <i>Kedoshim</i> Section 3, 7:7.</i> [the Rabbis have said as follows]: “I might think that the building of the Sanctuary overrides the Sabbath? Scripture therefore says, <i>Ye shall keep My Sabbaths, and reverence My Sanctuary: I am the Eternal</i>.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">241</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 19:30. This teaches that “all of you are obligated to keep My honor” (Yebamoth 6 a), and as the Meiri explains it: “you and the Sanctuary are obligated to keep My honor.” Thus the building of the Sanctuary does not override the Sabbath.</i><br>Now the reason for the word <i>Shabtothai</i> [in the plural] is because the Sabbaths of the year are many. By way of the Truth, [the mystic lore of the Cabala], He commanded here [the keeping of the “Sabbaths”] by <i>zachor</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">242</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>‘Remember’ the Sabbath-day</i> (above 20:8).</i> and <i>shamor</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">243</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>‘Observe’ the Sabbath-day</i> (Deuteronomy 5:12).</i> as I have hinted with reference to their secret,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">244</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 20:8.</i> this being the reason for the plural — <i>My Sabbaths</i>. Of the two of them [<i>zachor</i> and <i>shamor</i>] He says, <i>for it is a sign</i> [when He should have said “for <i>they</i> are a sign,” this is in order to indicate] that “it” [the Sabbath] is the sign <i>between Me and you… that ye may know</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">245</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See my Hebrew commentary here, p. 505, for the mystic interpretation thereof.</i> He states, <i>Ye shall keep the Sabbath</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">246</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 14.</i> and declares that those that profane it are liable to extinction,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">246</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 14.</i> for <i>the spirit returneth unto G-d who gave it</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">247</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ecclesiastes 12:7.</i> but the soul of that one [who profanes the Sabbath] will be cut off from there.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">248</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“It is measure for measure. On the Sabbath everything is in perfect Unity. But he who desecrates the Sabbath shows that he does not believe in that Unity, and therefore he deserves to be cut off from it” (Ma’or V’shamesh).</i> He states concerning the seventh day that it is <i>a Sabbath of solemn rest holy to G-d</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">249</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 15.</i> because it is the foundation of the world; of the Sabbath He also says that it is <i>a perpetual covenant</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">250</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 16.</i> and then He states again that <i>it is a sign between Me and the children of Israel</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">251</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 17.</i> meaning that the Sabbath is the sign on the seventh day, and the purport thereof is that the [seventh] day itself is a sign, and [its sanctification as] the Sabbath is the sign forever.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">252</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The allusions are Cabalistic.

FOR THIS MOSES, THE MAN THAT BROUGHT US UP OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT, and used to show us the way we were to go, WE KNOW NOT WHAT IT BECOME OF HIM. Now we need many gods which shall go before us.” This is Rashi’s language.<br>But his language does not fit [the verse, since Scripture indicates only that they wanted a leader in place of Moses, but not gods]. Rather, this verse is the key to understand the incident of the golden calf, and the thought of those who made it. For it is known that the Israelites did not think that Moses was a god, and that he did for them the signs and wonders through his own power. So what sense is there in their saying, “since Moses is gone from us, we will make ourselves gods?” Moreover, they clearly said, <i>make us, ‘elohim’ who shall go before us</i> — and not a deity who should give them life in this world or in the World to Come. Instead, they wanted another Moses, saying: “Moses, the man who showed us the way <i>from Egypt until now</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">256</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 14:19.</i> being in charge of the journeyings <i>at the commandment of the Eternal by the hand of Moses</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">257</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 9:23.</i> he is now lost to us; let us make ourselves another Moses who will show us the way at the commandment of the Eternal by his hand.” This is the reason for their mentioning, <i>Moses, the man that brought us up</i>, rather than saying “the G-d who brought them up,” for they needed <i>a man of G-d</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">258</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 33:1.</i> You can also understand this matter from Aaron’s answer to Moses our Teacher, when he asked him, <i>What did this people do unto thee, that thou hast brought a great sin upon them</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">259</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 21.</i> to which Aaron replied, <i>And they said unto me: Make us a god</i> etc. <i>And I said unto them: Whosoever hath any gold, let him break it off; so they gave it to me; and I cast it into the fire</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">260</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 23-24.</i> Now Aaron was apologizing to Moses and saying to him, <i>Let not the anger of my lord wax hot</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">261</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 22.</i> and yet here he was speaking as if adding <i>rebellion unto his sin</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">262</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 34:37.</i> saying that they asked of him an idol and he made it for them with his hands! So why should Moses’ anger not burn against him! What greater sin than this is there?<br>But the matter is as I have stated, that they did not want the calf to be for them in place of a god <i>who killeth and maketh alive</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">263</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 2:6.</i> whom they would take upon themselves to serve as a deity; instead, they wanted to have someone in place of Moses to show them the way. And this was the apology of Aaron. He argued that “they merely told me that I should make them <i>elohim</i> who would go before them in your place, my lord, because they did not know what had happened to you and whether you would return or not. Therefore they needed someone who would show them the way as long as you were not with them, and if perchance you would return they would leave him and follow you as before.” And so indeed it happened, for as soon as the people saw Moses, they immediately left the calf and rejected it, and they allowed him to burn it and scatter its powder upon the water,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">264</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 20.</i> and no one quarrelled with him at all. Similarly you will note that he did not rebuke the people nor say anything to them, and yet when he came into the camp <i>and he saw the calf and the dancing</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">265</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 19.</i> they immediately fled from before him; and he took the calf and burnt it [and scattered its powder upon the water] and made them drink of it, and yet they did not protest at all. But if the calf were to them in place of a god, it is surely not normal that a person should let his king and god be burnt in fire. Lo, if one burn their abominations before their eyes, would they not stone him?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">266</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See above, 8:22.</i> Now it was Aaron who brought forth this shape, for they did not tell him what he should make, whether <i>a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">267</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 22:27.</i> or other forms.

Because Israel was in a wilderness, a desolate wasteland, and destruction and everlasting desolation come from the north, as it is written, <i>Out of the north the evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">269</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 1:14.</i> the reference being not merely to the king of Babylon, as can be seen clearly from Scripture,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">270</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 15: <i>For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north</i> etc.</i> but rather [the intent of the verse is to state] that the attribute of justice comes to the world from the left,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">271</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As one faces the east, his left hand is to the north.</i> to requite upon all the inhabitants of the land according to their evil; and since in the account of the Divine Chariot it is said, <i>and the four of them had the face of an ox on the left side</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">272</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 1:10.</i> — therefore Aaron thought that the destroyer [the ox, which was to the left, i.e. the north] points to the place of destruction where its great power is centered, and when worshipping G-d through there <i>the spirit will be poured from on high</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">273</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 32:15.</i> just as it was put upon Moses. It is for this reason that Aaron said, <i>Tomorrow shall be a feast to the Eternal</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">274</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 5.</i> meaning that the services and the sacrifices would be to the Proper Name of G-d in order to obtain His favor upon the power [symbolized by] this image,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">275</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., “the ox” which is on the left side of the Divine Chariot, and denotes the attribute of justice. See my Hebrew commentary, p. 507.</i> for, it being before them, they would direct their thoughts towards the purport thereof [and thus would be able to mitigate the destructive forces of the wilderness].<br>It is our Rabbis who have taught us this interpretation, and it is they who have revealed the secret thereof. Thus they have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">276</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban is quoting here a composite of Midrashim in Shemoth Rabbah — 3:2, 42:5, 43:8.</i> “<i>‘Ra’oh ra’ithi’ (I have surely seen) the affliction of My people</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">277</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 3:7.</i> Said the Holy One, blessed be He, to Moses: ‘Moses, you see them in one appearance, and I see them in two appearances.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">278</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hence the double expression: <i>Ra’oh ra’ithi</i>, translated “I have surely seen.”</i> You see them coming to Sinai and accepting My Torah, and I see them contemplating Me and how I came forth in My ‘travelling coach’ to give them the Torah, as it is said, <i>The chariots of G-d are myriads, even thousands upon thousands</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">279</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 68:18.

The sense here is thus that “they will unhitch one of the four <i>chayoth</i> (creatures) in My Chariot, and worship it.”</i> of which it is written, <i>and the face of an ox on the left side</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">272</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 1:10.</i> and bring Me to anger with it.” <i>Tatromulin</i> means “four mules,” for <i>tetra</i> in Greek means “four,” just as the Rabbis have said,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">281</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nazir 8b.</i> [“If a person vowed, ‘I will be a <i>Nazir</i>] <i>tetragon</i>,’ he becomes [a <i>Nazir</i> for a period of] four times;” <i>mulin</i> means “mules,” just as in the expression, “The <i>mula’oth</i> (mules) of Rabbi’s house<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">282</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shabbath 52a.</i> [used to go out with their bits on the Sabbath].” The word <i>tatromulin</i> is thus used as a symbol of the four <i>chayoth</i> (living creatures) who carried the Divine Chariot.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">283</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 1:5.</i> And in Vayikra Rabbah [10:3] [we find the Midrash stating] that Aaron said, “Since I am building the altar, I will build it to the Name of the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is said, <i>and Aaron made a proclamation, and said, ‘Tomorrow shall be a feast to the Eternal.’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">274</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 5.</i> It is not written here, ‘Tomorrow shall be a feast to the calf,’ but <i>to the Eternal</i>.”<br>Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote that <i>elohim</i> in this case [<i>Arise, make us ‘elohim’</i>] means that Aaron should make them “something visible and corporeal on which the glory would rest. And if you will pay attention to the first journey,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">284</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 14:19. <i>And the angel of G-d, who went before the camp of Israel</i> etc. (Bachya).</i> you will understand this.” But this does not appear to me to be correct, since the calf was not made according to the manner of those proficient in the art of the constellations, so that the glory or some spiritual influence should dwell upon it; rather, the figure was made so that when the people would worship it they would direct their thoughts to the purport thereof [as explained above]. Now I have already explained<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">285</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 13:21.</i> the secret of the first journey, and far it be from Aaron that he should want to be likened to him. Instead, his desire was merely to take of [the <i>tatromulin</i>, as explained above] so that their journeys [in the wilderness] should be on the side of that attribute.

But Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra’s opinion is that Moses did not pray for Israel as long as the idol was among them;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">332</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hence the prayer recorded in Verses 11-13 was really not recited by Moses until after his descent from the mount and his cleansing the camp of the idolatrous worship, mentioned in Verses 15-29. — Ramban will differ with this interpretation of Ibn Ezra.</i> but only when G-d told him, <i>Let me alone, that I may destroy them</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">318</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 14.</i> and he realized that the fate [of the people] was dependent upon him, did he go down the mountain and destroy the calf, and then he returned to pray for forty days, there being no strict chronological order in the narrative of the Torah. But I do not agree with this opinion. For the prayer he recited upon his return to the mountain [after he had cleansed the camp of the idol] is the one which he mentions, <i>Oh, this people have sinned a great sin</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">326</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 31.</i> And if it is all one prayer<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">333</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., if the prayer mentioned in Verses 11-13, and the one in Verses 31-32, were both said at the same time, as Ibn Ezra would have it, namely during the forty days after he returned to the mountain, then why etc.</i> which Moses said during the forty days after he returned to the mountain, why does Scripture divide it, mentioning here [in Verses 11-13] part of it, and after he had come down, mentioning the other part [in Verses 31-32]? Rather, these are two separate prayers. Therefore it appears that when G-d told him <i>Let Me alone, that My wrath may wax hot against them</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">334</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 10 here.</i> Moses immediately <i>besought the face of the Eternal</i> and did not delay at all, for he was afraid lest the wrath go out from G-d and the plague would begin<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">335</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Numbers 17:11.</i> and consume them in a moment,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">336</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 10.</i> therefore at once he said, <i>Eternal, why doth Thy wrath wax hot against Thy people?</i> Similarly I found it in Eileh Shemoth Rabbah:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">337</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shemoth Rabbah 42:1.</i> “Said Moses: ‘If I leave Israel [to their fate] and go down the mountain, they will never have a restoration again. Instead I will not move from here until I seek mercy for them.’ Immediately Moses began pleading on their behalf etc.” Thus he prayed for them and G-d <i>repented of the evil which He said</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">338</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 14.</i> to kill them and destroy them. That does not mean that He was [completely] reconciled with them, but at least He said, “I have repented, I will not destroy them.” And now that Moses had time, he went down the mountain and burnt the calf, and punished its worshippers, and afterwards he said to the people, <i>I will go up unto the Eternal, perhaps I shall make atonement for your sin</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">339</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 30.</i> so that He should entirely forgive you.

Thus he told them of the golden calf they had made in Horeb,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">342</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 8.</i> on account of which he had to break the Tablets of the Law and to pray for them forty days and forty nights, and also for Aaron,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">343</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 20.</i> and how he was put to the trouble of burning the calf.

Perhaps Moses told him so in order to magnify his guilt.<br>The correct interpretation appears to me to be that this is like the verse, <i>What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">364</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 20:1.</i> Moses is thus saying: “What hatred did you have for this people, that you have [almost] brought about their destruction and annihilation?” Moses told him this because Aaron had served them in the function of one who reproves<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">365</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a reference to what the Rabbis have said that Aaron served as prophet while Israel was yet in Egypt. See commentaries to I Samuel 2:27.</i> and atones for them, and he should have had compassion and mercy on them [and should have made them desist from their course of conduct]; thus the meaning is: “You conducted yourself towards them as an enemy who desires to see their calamity, when they had neither sinned nor transgressed against you.” Now the proper order would have been for Moses to blame him firstly for the sin which he himself had done, and then to charge him for the sin which he brought upon the people, saying: “how did you do this great sin against G-d, causing also many people to trespass, and bringing a great sin upon them?” Moses, however, in his humility showed respect towards his elder brother, and only mentioned to him the stumbling of the people. It is possible that Moses’ <i>heart was steadfast, trusting</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">366</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 112:7.</i> in the righteousness of his brother [and he assumed] that his intention was not a bad one, [and therefore he did not reprove him for his own conduct]; but for the people’s guilt he did blame him, for he should have reproved them, and thus they stumbled because of him, — and Aaron replied that they deceived him with their words."

                    "NOW MOSES TOOK THE TENT AND WOULD PITCH IT WITHOUT THE CAMP. Rashi wrote: “This was practiced by Moses from the Day of Atonement until the Tabernacle was set up [five and a half months later — on the first day of Nisan], but not afterwards. For on the seventeenth day of Tammuz the Tablets of the Law were broken, on the eighteenth he burnt the calf and brought the sinners to judgment, and on the nineteenth he ascended the mountain and stayed there for forty days. On the first of Ellul it was said to him, <i>and come up in the morning</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">435</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 34:2.</i> to receive the second Tablets. There he spent another forty days [which terminated on the tenth day of Tishri]. On the tenth of Tishri the Holy One, blessed be He, became reconciled with Israel, and He handed over to Moses the second Tablets, whereupon Moses came down the mountain and began to command them concerning the work of the Tabernacle. This occupied them till the first of Nisan, and from that time on, since the Tabernacle was set up, G-d only communicated with him from there.” This also is the opinion of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra, that all this [narrated here in Verses 7-11] took place after Moses brought down the second Tablets [the account of which is narrated further on in 34:1-10], there being no strict chronological order in the narrative of the Torah.<br>But it does not appear to me to be correct, for what reason is there to mention this [practice of Moses] here in the middle of the section? The words of our Rabbis in all Midrashim are also to the effect that Moses did this on account of their sin with the calf. Thus they explained<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">436</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shemoth Rabbah 45:3.</i> [that Moses said], “One who is excommunicated from the master, is also excommunicated from the disciple,” and as Rashi mentioned [that G-d said to Moses], “I am angry and you are angry; if so, who will bring them near to Me?” Now if the removal of the Tent was after the Day of Atonement [as Rashi and Ibn Ezra have it], the Holy One, blessed be He, as well as Moses, was already in [complete] reconciliation with them! Rather, it appears that on the day that he came down from the mountain — on the seventeenth of Tamuz — he burnt the calf and punished the worshippers.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">437</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And not, as Rashi has it, that the burning of the calf and the punishing of the sinners took place on the eighteenth of Tammuz.</i> On the next day, [i.e., on the eighteenth of Tammuz] he told them that he would go up to G-d to seek atonement for them,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">438</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 32:30.</i> and so he went up to the mountain where the Glory was. This is the sense of the verse, <i>And Moses returned unto the Eternal</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">439</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 31.</i> and prayed briefly: <i>Oh, this people have sinned a great sin</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">439</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 31.</i> and G-d answered him, <i>Whosoever hath sinned against Me</i>, etc.;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">440</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 33.</i> <i>And now go, lead the people</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">441</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 34.</i> and the plague began.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">442</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 35.</i> Then He commanded him, <i>Depart, go up hence, thou and the people</i> etc.,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">443</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 1 here.</i> and Moses told this to Israel, <i>and they mourned, and stripped themselves of the ornaments</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">444</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verses 4-6.</i> Then Moses realized that the matter was a very long one, and did not know what the end thereof would be, therefore he took the tent and pitched it outside the camp so that the Divine Glory would communicate with him from there, for it was no longer dwelling in the midst of the people, and if the tent were to be in the midst of the camp, He would not communicate with him from there. Scripture continues, <i>and it came to pass, that every one that sought the Eternal…</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">445</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Verse 7 here.</i> meaning that everyone who sought the Eternal used to go out to him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">446</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban interprets the Hebrew <i>yeitzei</i> (the imperfect — “was going out”) as <i>yotzei</i> (a participle — taking of the nature of both a verb and an adjective — “used to go out”). Rashi explained it likewise.</i> Then Scripture [in Verse 8-11] completed the narrative of all that happened whilst the tent was there until the Tabernacle was set up, which was, according to the opinion of our Sages, from the Day of Atonement until the first day of Nisan.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">447</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ramban further, 40:2.</i><br>I have seen in Pirkei d’Rabbi Eliezer [the following text]:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">448</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chapters of Rabbi Eliezer, Chapter 46.</i> “Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korcha says: “[After the Revelation] Moses spent forty days on the mountain, studying the Written Law at daytime, and the Oral Law at night. After the forty days he took the Tablets and came back to the camp. On the seventeenth of Tammuz he broke the Tablets and killed the sinners of Israel, and then stayed in the camp forty days until he burnt the calf and ground it like dust of the earth. Thus he eliminated idolatry from Israel, and established each tribe in its place. On the first of Ellul the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, <i>come up unto Me into the mount</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">449</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 10:1.</i> [to be given the second Tablets]. Then the ram’s horn was sounded throughout the camp, announcing to the people that Moses was going up the mountain, so that [they might not be alarmed by his absence] and not be misled anymore after idols. [On that day] the Holy One, blessed be He, was exalted by the sound of that ram’s horn, as it is said, <i>G-d is gone up amidst shouting, the Eternal amidst the sound of the horn</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">450</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalm 47:6. “For by the sound of this horn Israel vowed eternally never again to be deceived by the idols” (R’dal; see my Hebrew commentary, p. 518).</i> And thus likewise the Sages ordained that we blow the horn every year on the first day of Ellul.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">451</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Shofar is now sounded in the synagogue every morning during the whole month of Ellul, except on the Sabbaths and on the day before the New Year.</i> Thus far are the words of this Agadah. And if this is so, then the whole section from: <i>Moses took the tent</i>, applied to the time from the eighteenth of Tammuz till the end of the forty days [i.e., up to the first of Ellul], and from the Day of Atonement till the first of Nisan [when the Tabernacle was set up]. But this exposition does not fit in well with what Scripture says, <i>And I fell down before the Eternal, as at the first, forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread</i> etc.,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">452</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 9:18.</i> and it is further written there, <i>So I fell down before the Eternal the forty days and forty nights that I fell down; because the Eternal had said He would destroy you</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">453</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 25.</i> and it is impossible that all this refers to the last forty days [i.e., between the first of Ellul and the Day of Atonement], since He told him, <i>Hew thee two Tablets of stone… and come up unto Me into the mount</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">449</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 10:1.</i> thus these last forty days were already those of G-d’s good-will, after He had already nullified the decree that <i>He would destroy you!</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">454</sup><i class=\"footnote\">From all this it is thus obvious that there was an intervening period of forty days [i.e. from the eighteenth of Tammuz to the twenty-ninth of Ab] when Moses was on the mountain interceeding for Israel. So how could the Pirkei d’Rabbi Eliezer hold that there were only two ascents of forty-day periods of Moses? — In his commentary to that Midrash, Rabbi David Luria answers Ramban’s question by suggesting that the phrase <i>He would destroy you</i> does not refer to the beginning of that verse, <i>so I fell down before the Eternal</i>, but reverts to the very beginning of the incident of the calf, when G-d had said He would destroy them. The verse itself can still apply then to the final forty days, which culminated on the Day of Atonement.</i>"

We must therefore say that this is the meaning thereof: <i>and his minister Joshua the son of Nun</i> rendered him such service as can be given only by a youthful attendant.”<br>In my opinion it is the way of the Sacred Language to call any attendant [regardless of age] <i>na’ar</i>, for the person of high office is called <i>ish</i> (man),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">458</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ramban Genesis 9:20, Vol. I, p. 141.</i> and [with respect to him] his attendant is called <i>na’ar</i>.

                    "The reason for the form <i>‘bin’ Nun</i> [instead of <i>‘ben’ Nun</i>] is that the vowel <i>chirik</i> comes sometimes in place of the <i>segal</i> [which would have made it “ben Nun”]. Similar cases are: <i>The words of Agur ‘bin’ (the son of) Jakeh;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">465</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 30:1.

Why [of all the times that Joshua the son of Nun is cited in the Scriptures] is the name of this righteous man not once mentioned properly [i.e., <i>‘ben’</i> Nun]? Therefore I think that they used to call him in this way as a mark of honor, since he was the greatest of the disciples of Moses our teacher, and so they called him <i>binun</i>, meaning “the understanding one,” since there was <i>none so discreet and wise</i> as he.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">468</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 41:39.</i> Or it may be that the meaning of it is: “Joshua, whom understanding begot;” they thus used the term <i>nun</i> as in the expression, <i>may his name ‘yinon’ (be continued) as long as the sun</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">469</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 72:17.</i>"

The following is its meaning by way of the Truth. Moses said, and <i>Thou hast not let me know</i> who is the angel <i>Thou wilt send with me</i>, and he requested that He fulfill two things He had said to him: firstly, that <i>I know thee by Name</i>, meaning [G-d said to Moses] that “I will be known to you by My [Great] Name, for your sake” [and this was now Moses’ request, that he be not divested of this highest degree of prophecy on account of the incident of the calf]. It is possible that the phrase, <i>yet Thou hast said</i>, [<i>I know thee by Name</i>], is based upon what He had said to Moses [with reference to the patriarchs], <i>but by My Name the Eternal I made Me not known to them</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">480</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 6:3. But to Moses He did reveal Himself by His Great Name, as explained there.</i> as I have explained [there]. And secondly Moses had been told: <i>and thou hast also found grace in My sight</i>, meaning that he will find grace, which is the cleaving of knowledge.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">481</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That G-d always be with them in the wilderness <i>face to face</i> (Abusaula).</i> And Moses continued, <i>Now therefore, I pray Thee, if I have found grace in Thy sight</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">482</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 13.</i> in the attribute of justice, <i>show me now</i> the paths of the ways<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">483</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“The paths of goodness with which You conduct Your world, and by which You are known” (Bachya).</i> even as Thou art known by Thy Name, <i>that I may know Thee</i> to declare Thy Unity, <i>to the end that I may find</i> the great <i>grace; and consider that this nation is Thy people</i> — Thou art their Father, and they are Thy children.

Rather, Scripture is stating that when all Israel went forth to meet him [upon his descent from the mountain with the second Tablets], they saw the beams of glory streaming from his face, <i>and they were afraid to come nigh him</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">552</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 30.</i> and stepped backwards.

The actual building thereof was delayed until after Moses’ intercession and the complete reconciliation of G-d with Israel. Rashi, however, following the principle that there is no strict chronological order in the narrative of the Torah, clearly writes: “The incident of the golden calf happened a considerable time before the command regarding the building of the Tabernacle was given” (Rashi above, 31-18). See my Hebrew commentary, p. 526, for further elucidation of this point.</i> the breaking of the Tablets.

This had to be stated because He did not say here: “whosoever doeth ‘any manner’ of work,” just as He said in the Ten Commandments, <i>thou shalt not do any manner of work</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 20:10.</i> but instead He merely said “work” without specifying any type. Therefore we might have excluded from the general statement [<i>whosoever doeth work</i> …] all activity necessary for the preparation of food, for we find it said about the feast of unleavened bread, <i>thou shalt not do work therein</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 16:8.</i> and yet the preparation of food is not included [in the scope of its prohibition]. It is for this reason that here He mentioned expressly that the preparation of food is also forbidden on the Sabbath.<br>I have found a similar text in the Midrash:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mechilta here.</i> “Rabbi Nathan says: <i>Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the Sabbath-day</i>. Why is this said? Because it is stated, <i>And Moses assembled all the congregation of the children of Israel</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 1. — Reference here in the Mechilta is of course to Verse 2: <i>whosoever doeth work therein</i>…, and as Ramban explained above. The insertion of the word “etc.” at the end of the verse mentioned in the text of Ramban, would clarify the matter completely. It is present in texts of the Mechilta.</i> I might think that one should be allowed to light a candle, to put away food to be kept warm, and to make a fire on the Sabbath. Therefore Scripture says, <i>Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the Sabbath-day</i>.” This corresponds closely to that which we have said, that these works [mentioned in the Mechilta], since they are of direct benefit to the body, were not included in the first prohibition. Thus Rabbi Nathan wanted to say that the purpose of the verse here is not to prohibit baking, cooking, and the rest of the activities involved in the preparation of food, for these have already been prohibited to them by the verse, <i>Bake that</i> [on the sixth day of the week] <i>which ye will bake</i> [i.e., which ye intend to bake on the Sabbath], <i>and seethe that which ye will seethe</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 16:23.</i> But yet I might think that all activities which benefit man in such a way that the benefit is only to the body — such as lighting a candle, making fire, or washing one’s whole body in hot water — should be allowed, for these are part of the delight of the Sabbath.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Isaiah 58:13.</i> Therefore it says, <i>Ye shall kindle no fire</i> — to prohibit all [mentioned activities even if done for these purposes].<br>Our Rabbis in the Talmud<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shabbath 70a.</i> have yet another Midrash on this verse, because it does not say: “whosoever doeth any manner of work therein shall be put to death,” or: “whosoever kindles fire throughout your habitations shall be put to death.” Therefore they said that the kindling of fire was singled out in order to make it punishable in a less stringent manner, [namely by stripe], since it is a mere negative command, [whereas violation of the Sabbath by doing any of the other kinds of work is punishable by death]. But another Sage<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is Rabbi Nathan.</i> holds that it was singled out in order to separate it, since it was included in the prohibition, <i>thou shalt not do any manner of work</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 20:10. It was thus singled out to indicate a general principle: just as in the case of kindling, which is specifically mentioned although it is included in the prohibition, <i>thou shalt not do any manner of work in it</i>, one becomes liable to punishment for transgressing it alone, so also in the case of all the other thirty-nine categories of forbidden work on the Sabbath, one becomes liable upon transgressing each one of them by itself. For otherwise we might have thought that only if one has done all thirty-nine main classes of “work” he is liable to punishment; therefore kindling of fire was singled out in order to teach that the punishment applies even if he has done but one kind of “work” (Rashi, Yebamoth 6 b). For it is one of the thirteen rules of interpretation of the Torah: “If anything is included in a general proposition and is then made the subject of a special statement, that which is predicated of it is not to be understood as limited to itself alone, but is to be applied to the whole of the general proposition.” Similarly we might have thought that if one has done all thirty-nine main classes of “work” on the Sabbath through error he is liable to bring but one sin-offering, therefore kindling of fire was singled out to teach that he is liable to bring such an offering for each of the main classes of “work” he has done.</i>"

This procedure [of Moses’ telling the workers the exact details of the measurements] Scripture does not mention, for it is understood that he told them everything in order, since they made each part exactly as prescribed. And the reason why Scripture does not mention it is that it was not necessary for Moses to go with them into the smallest details as they are mentioned at the command and the construction; instead, he told it to them briefly, as if to say that they should make the Tabernacle of ten curtains, five opposite five, and they themselves understood that they had to make loops corresponding to clasps of gold in order to couple the curtains together. Similarly with the rest of the work, he hinted to them the matter in brief, and they understood everything. It is for this reason that Scripture does not dwell at length on this detail [of Moses’ instruction to the workers], since its hints [at the same time] at their wisdom, understanding, and good sense. After this Scripture describes again the whole work in a specific way as at first, stating, <i>And every wise-hearted man among them that wrought the work made the Tabernacle; and he made curtains of goats’ hair;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 14.</i> <i>and he made the boards</i> etc.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 20.</i><br>Now it would have been sufficient in this whole subject for Scripture to have said, “and Moses told the whole congregation of the children of Israel all the work which G-d had commanded him,” and then say, “and the children of Israel did <i>according to all that the Eternal had commanded Moses</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 39:42.</i> <i>so did they. And Moses saw all the work, and behold they had done it, as the Eternal had commanded, even so had they done it. And Moses blessed them</i>.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 43.</i> Scripture, however, wanted to state that Moses mentioned to the whole congregation of the children of Israel and the wise men who were there all the work in general, for he intended thereby to stir the people to donate sufficiently for the large work, and in order also that the wise men should hear [the entire scope of the work] and would know if they could undertake to do everything as he had been commanded. Then Scripture mentions in detail the whole work in order to tell us that all the wise men worked on the Tabernacle. It is with reference to this that Scripture states here, <i>And every wise-hearted man among them that wrought the work made the Tabernacle of ten curtains</i>. The verses stating, <i>and he made curtains of goats’ hair</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 14.</i> <i>and he made the boards</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 20.</i> mean: “and every wise-hearted man made the curtains of goats’ hair,” [not Bezalel alone].<br>In the case of the ark, however, Scripture mentions specifically, <i>and Bezalel made the ark</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 37:1.</i> in order to say that the greatest craftsman amongst them made the ark alone. The reason for this is because he was filled <i>with the spirit of G-d, in wisdom, and understanding, and in knowledge</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">64</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 31:3.</i> so that he could contemplate its meaning and make it with the proper intention. For in the actual making of the ark there was no great craftsmanship entailed, there being amongst the other work things which required greater skill than that of the ark. [Hence we must conclude that Bezalel was required to make the ark on account of its great significance.]<br>Then Scripture again states without elaboration, <i>and he made the table</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 37:10.</i> <i>and he made the candelabrum</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 17.</i> In the opinion of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 37:1.</i> this alludes to Bezalel who made all the sacred vessels. But this is not my opinion, for in the case of the court of the Tabernacle it likewise says, <i>and he made the court</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">67</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 38:9. And it would not be reasonable to say that Bezalel alone made the court.</i> Rather, this refers back to every <i>wise-hearted man</i> as mentioned in the making of the Tabernacle.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mentioned here in the verse before us (36:8), and as explained above.</i><br>After Scripture completed the account of the construction of the Tabernacle in general and particular terms, it mentions their bringing it to Moses in a general way, stating, <i>And they brought the Tabernacle unto Moses, the Tent, and all its vessels</i> etc.,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 39:33.</i> in order to tell of their wisdom, in that they brought everything in order and no one brought his work to Moses until the whole work had been completed, as Scripture says, <i>Thus was finished all the work of the Tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 32.</i> After it was finished they all gathered and showed it to Moses in order, saying at first: “Our Rabbi, here is the Tent and there are its vessels,” and afterwards they said, “Here is the ark and here are its staves,” and so on with everything.<br>Now [in this whole section of <i>Vayakheil</i>] Scripture does not state that the Tabernacle and its vessels were made “as the Eternal commanded Moses.” But in the next section of <i>Eileh Pekudei</i>, with reference to the garments of priesthood, it mentions such a statement at each item. The reason for this is that the whole work of the Tabernacle is included in the verse mentioned at the end, <i>And Bezalel the son of Uri… made all that the Eternal commanded Moses</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 38:22.</i> Perhaps it is because of the change of the order, as our Rabbis have mentioned.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">72</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Berachoth 55a. Moses told Bezalel to make “the ark, vessels and the Tabernacle.” But Bezalel said to him, “It is the way of the world first to build a house and then to place in it its various utensils. Perhaps G-d told you to make the Tabernacle, and then the ark and vessels.” Moses consented, and Bezalel made them in this order.</i><br>In general, then, all this repetition in the account of the Tabernacle is a sign of love and distinction, showing that G-d desires the work, and He mentions it in His Torah many times in order to increase the reward of those who engage themselves in its study. This is similar to what the Rabbis have said in the Midrash:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">73</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Bereshith Rabbah 60:11.</i> “The ordinary conversation of the servants of the patriarchs’ homes is more pleasing to the Holy One, blessed be He, than even the Torah-discourses of their children, for the section about Eliezer [as he recounts his journey],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">74</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 24:34-48.</i> comprises two or three columns in the Torah, [whereas many important principles of the Torah are derived from only slight references in the text].”"

                    "OF THE MIRRORS ‘HATZOVOTH’ (OF THE SERVING WOMEN). “The women of Israel possessed mirrors of brass which they used to look into when they adorned themselves, and even these they did not withhold [from donating to the Tabernacle]. But Moses was reluctant to accept them because they were made to arouse sensual desires. Said the Holy One, blessed be He, to Moses: ‘These are dearer to Me than all [other donations], for by means of them the women raised many hosts in Egypt, etc. For this reason the laver was made from these mirrors, because it was used in order to bring peace between husband and wife; for it was out of this laver that they took the water which they give to drink to a woman who was warned by her husband not to meet a certain man privately and who had nevertheless associated with him.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">78</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 5:17-24.</i> This is Rashi’s language.<br>The meaning of this Midrash is that in the whole work of the Tabernacle they accepted ornaments from women, as it is written, <i>And they came, both men and women… and brought nose-rings, and ear-rings, and signet-rings ‘v’chumaz’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">79</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 35:22.</i> — the <i>chumaz</i>, according to its Midrashic interpretation, being even more undesirable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">80</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Shabbath 64, the <i>chumaz</i> is explained as an ornament worn by women on their pudendum.</i> There, however, all the donations became mixed together, whereas here they were to make one specific vessel purely from ornaments [i.e., the mirrors] which were made to arouse sensual desire. Therefore Moses did not consent at first [to accept them] until he was told to do so by the Almighty.<br>But I do not know how to explain according to this Midrash the phrase — <i>that did service at the door of the Tent of Meeting</i> — [since the Tent of Meeting had not yet been put up]. Perhaps it can be said that the women brought this donation to Moses’ tent, which he called the Tent of Meeting,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">81</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 33:7.</i> and he himself received it from them by word of G-d, since the tent of the Tabernacle had not yet been made. Onkelos’ translation, “women that came to pray at the door of the Tent of Meeting,” accords approximately to the words of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra, who said that these women worshipped G-d, and turned away from the desires of this world and gave their mirrors as a donation, coming each day to the door of the Tent of Meeting to pray and to hear instruction about the commandments.<br>In line with the plain meaning of Scripture, it is also possible to say that Moses <i>made the laver and its base for the mirrors</i> of the women who came in a great crowd,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">82</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban thus interprets the word <i>tzavu</i> as being from the root <i>tzava</i> (a host). <i>Of the mirrors ‘hatzovoth’</i> would thus mean “of the mirrors of the hosts of women” who assembled at the door of the Tent of Meeting.</i> <i>and assembled at the door of the Tent of Meeting</i> in order to give their mirrors in the generosity of their hearts. Now the brass of the mirrors was <i>burnished brass</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">83</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 1:7.</i> resplendent and very beautiful. It is for this reason that he set aside this brass from the beginning for the making of this vessel. Upon seeing this [that Moses accepted it from them], the women gathered and came in many hosts, all of them wanting to give their mirrors for the making of the whole laver and its base. It is also correct to explain that they had in mind right at the start to offer them for the laver because of its use in connection with the suspected adulteress [as explained above], and they accepted the law [of the suspected adulteress] upon themselves with joy, and offered to give all their mirrors.<br>Pekudei"

                    "THESE ARE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE TABERNACLE, THE TABERNACLE OF THE TESTIMONY. Scripture uses this expression because the term “Tabernacle” means the curtains of fine-twined linen, which are so called both when the command was given<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>And thou shalt make the Tabernacle of ten curtains</i> (above, 26:1).</i> and at the construction of the Tabernacle,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>And every wise-hearted man… made the Tabernacle of ten curtains</i> (<i>ibid.</i>, 36:8).

But the holy vessels — the ark, the table, the candelabrum, and the altars — are not included in the term “Tabernacle,” for they were in the hands of Eleazar.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 3:32. The verse refers to the time of the journeying through the wilderness.</i> But this is not my opinion, for why should Scripture mention the entrusting of those things given to Ithamar, and not mention that of Eleazar, which was the more honored one? Rather, <i>these are the accounts of</i> hints at those things that Scripture mentions in the section further on, thus stating that <i>the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation was a hundred talents</i> etc.,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 25.</i> — from which were made the sockets, the hooks for the pillars, the overlaying of their capitals and their fillets.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 27-28.</i> And <i>the brass of the wave-offering</i>, which was seventy talents, from which were made the brazen altar and its grating and all its vessels, and the sockets of the court and the pins<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 29-31.</i> — all these Moses gave over by number and weight through the hand of Ithamar. Now the section does not say what was done with the gold, for that was partly in the charge of Ithamar, namely, that used for covering the boards and the bars, and part of it was in the charge of Eleazar — the ark and the cover, the candelabrum, the table, and the golden altar. Now since one cannot know exactly how much gold went into the covering of each of these vessels, Scripture did not say that Moses gave it over to them by number and weight. It is for this reason that Scripture did not mention here the entrusting of the things given to Eleazar, for its intention here is only to speak of the work of the Tabernacle, not of that involved in the journeyings. Do not object [to this explanation] because Scripture mentions here <i>the brazen altar</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 30.</i> which was in the charge of Eleazar,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 3:31-32.</i> for Scripture had to state that they made it out of the brass of the wave-offering, therefore it was not particular to exclude this one item from the general list of objects of which it said that they were <i>by the hand of Ithamar</i>, this being the way of Scripture in many places.<br>Scripture does not mention in this section the laver and its base [which were also made of brass, and were under the charge of Ithamar], because it was not made according to a specified weight; instead, he put into it all the mirrors that the women brought together<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">see Ramban above, 38:8, towards the end.</i> and thus Moses did not know its weight. It is possible that these were not under the charge of Ithamar [and therefore they are not mentioned], but they come into the category of that which Scripture says [of the children of Kohath, whose work was under the charge of Eleazar], <i>and their charge was the ark, and the table, and the candelabrum, and the altars, and the vessels of the Sanctuary wherewith the priests minister</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 3:31.</i> for through the laver and its base the priests were enabled to minister at the altar.

                    "ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE FIRST MONTH SHALT THOU SET UP THE TABERNACLE OF THE TENT OF MEETING. In the opinion of our Rabbis<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifra, beginning of <i>Seder Shemini</i>.</i> who say that this was on the eighth day of the installation [of the priests into their sacred office],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On the first seven days of the installation the Tabernacle was put up and taken apart each day. But on the eighth day it was put up and no longer dismantled until they moved away from the encampment at Mount Sinai. Accordingly, since in the opinion of the Rabbis the first day of Nisan was the eighth day of the installation, the expression <i>thou shalt set up the Tabernacle</i> must mean “set it up permanently etc.,”</i> the meaning of the verse is: “you are to put up the Tabernacle and it should remain so; do not dismantle it and do not put it up again, for when the camps will move, the Levites will dismantle it and put it up.” It was not necessary that G-d should command Moses now about the putting up of the Tabernacle during the first seven days, since He had told him at the start, <i>And thou shalt set up the Tabernacle according to the fashion thereof which hath been shown thee in the mountain</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 26:30.</i> Now since He explained to him here that <i>On the first day of the first month</i> the setting up of the Tabernacle would be of a permanent nature, Moses thus understood that during [each of] the seven days of installation it would be necessary for him to put it up and to dismantle it. Perhaps this was done in order to train the Levites how to do it, for they would see how he did it and would do likewise. Or it may be that this was done in order to crown the eighth day with this special crown [that the Tabernacle was for the first time not dismantled on that day].<br>It would appear according to the opinion of the Rabbis that on the first seven days Moses put up the Tabernacle each morning, and it remained standing all day and all the following night, and at each dawn he would dismantle it and put it up again immediately, for Scripture says, <i>And at the door of the Tent of Meeting shall ye abide day and night for seven days</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 8:35.</i> and there could be no “door” to the Tent of Meeting except at the time when it was erected.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus since Scripture states that during the first seven days of the installation Aaron and his sons had to sit <i>at the door of the Tent of Meeting</i>, we must therefore conclude that the Tabernacle was dismantled at dawn and put up again immediately.</i> The Sages have already interpreted:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifra <i>Vayikra, parshata</i> 4.</i> “<i>he shall bring it to the door of the Tent of Meeting</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 1:3.</i> — at the time when it is open, and not when [the Tent of Meeting] is taken to pieces.” Similarly, the Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zebachim 55b.</i> “Peace-offerings which have been slaughtered before the doors of the Sanctuary were opened are invalid, because it is said, <i>and he shall slaughter it at the door of the Tent of Meeting</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 3:2.</i> — at the time it is open, and not when it is locked.” Similarly, “at the Tabernacle, [peace-offerings which were slaughtered] before the Levites put up the Tabernacle, or after the Levites had dismantled it, were invalid.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zebachim 55b.</i> Moreover, [during the first seven days of installation, Moses] used to sacrifice the Daily Offering of the evening and kindle the lamps at night. And in Vayikra Rabbah<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I have not found this quotation in Vayikra Rabbah, but in Tanchuma <i>Pekudei</i>, 11.</i> I have seen [the following text]: “Moses used to put up the Tabernacle and dismantle it twice every day. Rabbi Chanina the Great says: three times every day, for [the phrase ‘putting up’ of the Tabernacle] is mentioned three times: <i>thou shalt put up;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Verse 2 before us.</i> <i>the Tabernacle was put up;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 17.</i> <i>and Moses put up the Tabernacle</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 18.</i> Once it was put up for the Daily Offering of the morning, and once for the special offerings of the installation, and once for the Daily Offering of the evening.” It is possible that all this was done for the sake of practice, so that they would know the procedure for putting it up, and which order to follow, but they never left it in a dismantled state at all [during the seven days of installation].<br>And that which Scripture states here, <i>And the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the Glory of the Eternal filled the Tabernacle</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 34.</i> in the opinion of the Rabbis it refers to the eighth day, for Scripture says, <i>So Moses finished the work</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 33.</i> and when he had completed this erection on the first of Nisan, the cloud covered the Tabernacle. Now Rashi has already mentioned the interpretation of the Rabbis: “<i>And they came out and blessed the people</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 9:23.</i> During all the seven days of installation when Moses was putting up the Tabernacle, and officiating therein, and dismantling it,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Our Rashi adds: “every day.”</i> the Divine Glory did not rest upon it, and the Israelites felt ashamed, and they said to Moses: ‘Our master! All the trouble which we have taken was only so that the Divine Glory would dwell amongst us, and that we would know that the sin of the calf has been atoned for!’ Then Moses said to them: ‘My brother Aaron is more worthy and meritorious than I am, and it is through his offerings and service that the Divine Glory will rest upon us.’”<br>And in the <i>Parshath Hamiluim</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifra, beginning of <i>Seder Shemini</i>.</i> (the Chapter of the Installation) we find written: “I might think that the Tabernacle was put up on the first of the month of Nisan, and that the Divine Glory did not rest thereon until the eighth day of the month. Scripture therefore says, <i>And on the day that the Tabernacle was put up, the cloud covered the Tabernacle, even the Tent of Meeting</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 9:15.</i> This teaches us that on the day the Tabernacle was put up, the Divine Glory rested thereon through the service of Aaron.” Thus the Rabbis are clearly saying that the cloud covering the Tabernacle was on the eighth day of the installation, which was on the first day of Nisan.<br>If this is so, then this whole chapter, in the opinion of the Rabbis, took place on the eighth day of the installation. This is indeed so, because Scripture describes the sequence of events as follows: G-d commanded Moses that the final putting up of the Tabernacle should be <i>on the first day of the first month</i>, and then it states that Moses did so and finished the whole work<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 33.</i> [of the seven days of installation], and then [on the eighth day] <i>the cloud covered the tent</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 34.</i> and so it was always [henceforth whenever they journeyed and put up the Tabernacle at their new place of encampment]. Then Scripture goes back to the beginning of the communication which came to Moses from the Tent, saying, <i>And He called unto Moses</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 1:1.</i> All this is now in proper order.<br>A kind of proof to what the Rabbis have said, [that during the seven days of installation the Tabernacle was dismantled every day], is what Scripture says, <i>And it came to pass on the day that Moses had made an end of setting up the Tabernacle</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 7:1.</i> Now if he did not dismantle it, what sense is there to the expression, <i>the day that he ‘made an end’ of setting up the Tabernacle</i>, since he began and finished all the work in one day? In that case it should rather have said: “and it came to pass on the day that Moses set up the Tabernacle.” Moreover, it says there [with reference to the eighth day], <i>This is the thing which the Eternal commanded that ye should do;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">64</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 9:6.</i> <i>and the Glory of the Eternal appeared unto all the people</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 23.</i> The implication of these verses is that the cloud had not yet covered the Tent of Meeting, and the Glory of the Eternal did not yet fill the Tabernacle.<br>However it may be, from the first day of the installation G-d communicated to Moses from the Tabernacle all the sections from the beginning of the Book of Leviticus until <i>And it came to pass on the eighth day</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 9:1.</i> But the cloud did not cover the Tabernacle, and the people therefore thought that the communication from there to Moses was directly from heaven, just as it was in the land of Egypt. But in the Midrash Chazit<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">67</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I have not found it in Shir Hashirim Rabbah ( Midrash Chazit ), but in Koheleth Rabbah 1:31.</i> I have found the following text: “<i>And it came to pass on the eighth day</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 9:1.</i> This really should have been the beginning of the Book of Leviticus. Why then was it written here? Because there is no strict chronological order in the narrative of the Torah.” Now if this is so, then the chapter beginning <i>And He called unto Moses… out of the Tent of Meeting</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 1:1.</i> happened after <i>and the Glory of the Eternal appeared unto all the people. And there came forth fire from before the Eternal, and consumed upon the altar;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 9:23-24.</i> and the communication addressed to Aaron, <i>drink no wine or strong drink</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 10:9.</i> took place on the following day, for it is impossible that G-d should speak to Aaron from the Tent of Meeting before He had spoken to Moses.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\">But if we say, as Ramban does, that G-d already spoke to Moses from the Tent of Meeting on the first day of the installation, then the communication to Aaron, <i>drink no wine nor strong drink</i>, took place on the eighth day of the installation.</i> But I do not know whether this Midrash represents the unanimous opinion of all the Sages, or whether they are the words of a single Sage, for they are mentioned there in the Midrash with reference to Rabbi Yishmael.",

All the seven days of the installation Moses burnt the incense on the golden altar, and even though he was not specifically told to do so when he was commanded,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">97</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Verse 5: <i>And thou shalt set the golden altar for incense</i>…</i> he did so nonetheless, for he understood that he was to do so from all the other acts of service, since G-d had commanded him here that he should set the bread<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">91</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 4.</i> and kindle the lamps.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">91</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 4.</i> Similarly, <i>and he offered upon it the burnt-offering and the meal-offering</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">93</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 29.</i> means that Moses was the one who offered them, for thus he was commanded, <i>Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">98</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 29:38.</i> meaning that he was to begin to do this when performing the Service during the days of the installation, for all commands there [about the burnt- and the meal-offering]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">99</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 39-41.</i> refer to Moses’ service. Afterward, it says, <i>It shall be a continual burnt-offering throughout your generations</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">100</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 42.</i> meaning that the priests shall do throughout the generations as Moses now did. Therefore in the section of <i>Pinchas</i> it says about this Daily Offering, <i>It is a continual burnt-offering, which was offered in Mount Sinai</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">101</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 28:6.</i> meaning that Moses began doing it there. Thus Moses our Teacher was the first priest in all these acts of service, therefore he also burnt the incense. Perhaps this is included in the words, <i>and thou shalt put the golden altar for incense</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">92</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 5.</i> meaning that he should immediately burn the incense on it. And that which is said at the time of the command, <i>And thou shalt put it before the veil… and Aaron shall burn thereon the incense of sweet spices</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">102</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 30:6-7.</i> refers to the proper time, from the day that Aaron begins his service and forever afterwards, [and does not exclude Moses’ service during the seven days], for so He said, <i>And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at dusk</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">103</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 8.</i> and he only lit them from that day on, for here Moses was clearly commanded: <i>and thou shalt light the lamps thereof</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">104</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 4. Accordingly, the verse here in this chapter must refer to the seven days of the installation when Moses acted as the priest, and the verses above (30:6-8) refer to the time when Aaron would take charge of the service.</i><br>Now in Rashi’s commentary I have seen this text:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">105</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is not found in our texts of Rashi.</i> “<i>And he — Aaron — burnt thereon incense (of sweet spices)</i> morning and evening, as it is said, <i>every morning, when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn it. And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at dusk</i> etc.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">106</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 30:7-8.</i> But I do not know if this is the scribe’s mistake.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">107</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For, as explained above, the verse here speaks of Moses doing the service, and not Aaron, since the account here is of what happened during the seven days of the installation.</i>"

                    "AND THE CLOUD COVERED THE TENT OF MEETING etc. Scripture is stating that the cloud covered the Tabernacle from all sides, with the result that the building was covered and hidden in it. ",
                    "AND THE GLORY OF THE ETERNAL FILLED THE TABERNACLE, this means that it was filled completely with the Glory, for the Glory rested within the cloud inside the Tabernacle, just as it is said with reference to Mount Sinai, <i>unto the thick darkness where G-d was</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">108</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 20:21.</i> It states further on that <i>Moses was not able to come into the Tent of Meeting</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">109</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 35.</i> — even to the door, because the cloud covered it, and he was not permitted to come into the cloud. Moreover, <i>the Glory of the Eternal filled the Tabernacle</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">109</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 35.</i> so how could he enter it? The reason for this was so that Moses should not go in without permission, but instead G-d would call him and then he was to come into the midst of the cloud, just as He had done at Mount Sinai, as it is said, <i>and He called unto Moses on the seventh day out of the midst of the cloud</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">110</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 24:16.</i> and then it says, <i>And Moses entered into the midst of the cloud</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">111</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 18.</i><br>In line with the plain meaning of Scripture, it is because it is said, <i>and the Eternal spoke unto him out of the Tent of Meeting</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">112</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 1:1.</i> that Moses did not enter the Tabernacle, but G-d called him from the Tent of Meeting and he stood at its door and He spoke to him. But our Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">113</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifra, Introduction, 8.</i> “One verse states, <i>And Moses was not able to enter into the Tent of Meeting</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">109</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 35.</i> and another verse states, <i>and when Moses went into the Tent of Meeting</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">114</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 7:89.</i> [thus the two verses appear to be contradictory]! The matter is decided by the passage, <i>because the cloud abode thereon</i>.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">115</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here in Verse 35. “From this you learn that as long as the cloud was there, Moses was not able to enter; when the cloud withdrew, Moses entered and He spoke with him” (Sifra <i>ibid.</i>).</i> For in the opinion of the Rabbis, the phrase <i>and when Moses went into the Tent of Meeting</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">114</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 7:89.</i> means that he went inside of his own accord without being called. Or it may be that because Scripture states there, <i>and he heard the Voice speaking unto him from above the ark-cover</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">114</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 7:89.</i> therefore it appeared to the Rabbis that Moses stood within the Tent before the ark-cover. Now as long as the Glory of G-d filled the Tabernacle, Moses did not enter it. Therefore they say that he only would enter after the cloud withdrew, meaning after it withdrew from covering the whole Tent, and the Glory no longer filled the Tabernacle. That was only on the eighth day of the installation when the Glory descended there,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">116</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 9:23-24.</i> and as for the call that came to Moses, of which it is said, <i>And he called unto Moses</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">112</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 1:1.</i> that happened, in the opinion of the Rabbis, before [the eighth day, namely, on the first day of the installation], as I have explained above.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">117</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 2.</i> It is possible that the verse before us which repeats, <i>and the Glory of the Eternal filled the Tabernacle</i> [when it had already stated, <i>and the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting</i>], alludes to the Glory that dwells within it.",
