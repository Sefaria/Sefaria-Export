                    "[Why did G-d tell Moses to preface his actions with these words of rebuke here? Ramban explains:] Because this (blood) was a plague, and from this point, He will begin to strike with several plagues, G-d (through Moses) was telling him that it is hs wickedness that is causing him to bring punishment upon himself because he did not heed the commandment of his Creator. [Once Pharaoh witnessed the wonder of the staff, which took place the last time that Moses spoke to him, Pharaoh no longer seemed to have an explicitly negative reaction. Why then does Scripture accuse him of refusing to heed G-d's command? Ramban explains:] Now Pharaoh did not tell them explicitly that he would not heed and not send out the people, except the first time when he said, \"I do not know HaShem nor will I send out Israel\" (above 5:2). Pharaoh did not angrily shout at Moses and Aaron, rather he merely heard their words and remained silent because he was fearful of the upcoming plagues from the time that Moses and Aaron performed before him the wonder of the tanin and that it swallowed their staffs. However for the first plagues he tested the capabilities of the necromancers to do as [Moses and Aaron] did, as if to say that [Moses' plagues] were not miraculous but rather acts of those wise in the arts of producing such things. Thus, Pharaoh was fearful of the upcoming plagues but made himself strong to overcome his fear, and this is the meaning of \"the heart of Pharaoh strengthened\". "
