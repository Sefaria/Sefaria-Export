                    "<b>For the sons of Yoseif for the sons of Ephraim</b>. The verse mentioned Ephraim before Menashe and juxtaposed Yoseif to Ephraim, and the same further on regarding the banners, because Ephraim was the one who carried the banner and he was the firstborn; his brother came second to him, as Yaakov’s blessing. Furthermore, Ephraim’s descendants were more numerous than those of Menashe. However, in the second counting at the Plains of Moav, Menashe was mentioned first because at that time Menashe’s descendants were more numerous and they took their inheritance first. Similarly, when it mentions the Land of Israel’s leaders it mentions him first and connects Yoseif to him. However, regarding the spies Ephraim is mentioned first although it juxtaposes Yoseif to Menashe (13:11), “For the tribe of Yoseif, for the tribe of Menashe.” This can be explained in the way of Aggadata, since Yoseif was the one who brought a bad report about his brothers the Torah connects the slanderers to him. Alternatively, the Torah apportions honor to both of them, and the mention of his leader (Yehoshua) was sufficient honor for Ephraim."

Similarly, it is a merit for them all to be counted by Moshe and Aharon in that Moshe and Aharon will place their eye upon them for good, and beseech for mercy on their behalf (Devarim 1:11): “Hashem, God of your forefathers, will add to you a thousandfold as many as you are” — may Hashem never decrease your number."

                    "<b>Hashem spoke to Moshe in the Sinai desert, saying</b>. The tribe of Levi was not like all the other tribes, because from the age of one month and over, there were only twenty-two thousand, and from the age of thirty they were eight thousand. Therefore, Levites from the age of twenty and above were not even equal to half of the least numerous tribe. And as of yet, they did not carry the Aron, whose holiness would reduce their number. This, then, raises a strong difficulty: How is that His servants and pious ones were not blessed by Hashem as were the rest of the nation? I think that this lends support to the statement of our Rabbis that the tribe of Levi was not enslaved in the crushing Egyptian servitude. This is in contrast to the Israelites, whose lives were embittered by the Egyptians with hard labor so as to reduce their numbers, and in return, the Holy One increased their population, in defiance of the Egyptian decree, as it says, “But the more [the Egyptians] oppressed him, the more [the B’nei Yisrael] increased and spread.” Furthermore, it is stated concerning the verse, “If it is a boy, kill him” — “and the people increased and were very mighty.” This is because Hashem said, “Let us see whose words shall stand, Mine or theirs.” The tribe of Levi, however, multiplied in the normal way and did not increase as much as the other tribes. Perhaps this was due to the elder’s [Yaakov’s] anger at them. Shimon, who was at this point a large population, decreased at the time of entry to Eretz Yisroel to 22,000, and Levi, the tribe of His pious ones, did not decrease in the plague."

They will belong to the <i>kohein</i> he chooses, as his property. Accordingly, second tithes, fourth year fruit and tithes from livestock, which are called “holy to Hashem,” belong to the owner as his own property. However, when the Torah commands in Parshas Korach to give sacred objects to the <i>kohein</i>, they belong entirely to the <i>kohein</i> to whom the owner decides to give, and no other <i>kohanim</i> may take them away from him. This teaches us, automatically, that only the executory benefits belong to the owner."

Here, Aharon and his sons were commanded to bless them for the future generations, and the Torah spells out the blessing they should use. This blessing was mentioned next to the assembly of the <i>Mikdash</i>, “for there Hashem commanded the blessing, life forever” (Tehillim 133:3). Furthermore, our Sages said in the <i>Mishnah</i> (Sotah 7:6) that the <i>kohanim</i> would pronounce the name of Hashem as it is written (the Ineffable Name of Hashem) and in the <i>medina</i> (outside the <i>Mikdash</i>) as the appellation (Hashem). Also, in the <i>Mikdash</i> they would say the <i>kohein’s</i> blessing as one blessing (because the people did not answer Amen between verses) and in the <i>medina</i> — three blessings (they answered Amen). Thus, the blessing in the <i>Mikdash</i> was special in that the Ineffable Name was used [and therefore it was juxtaposed to the assembly of the <i>Mikdash</i>]."

Therefore, the Torah mentioned first that it should be beaten [and then that it should be of gold]. It did not mention that it should be made with branches [because it is obvious that without branches it is invalid, since without branches it would not be a menorah]. Nor does it mention knobs and cups engraved in almond shaped patterns [because if they are not present the Menorah is valid]. It mentions gold because there is a mitzvah for future generations to make the Menorah of gold, to elevate the House of Hashem. The verse then repeats: “It is beaten out of a solid block,” to teach that only the law of being beaten out of a solid block [if it is made of gold] prevents fulfillment of the obligation, but not the law of being made of gold. So much the more so — a lack of the other adornments does not make it invalid. This was taught by our Sages in Sifrei (here) and in Mesaches Menachos (28a). <b>So he made</b>. Moshe, who was mentioned previously, made it. He struggled to learn how to make it and made it by commanding [Betzalel to do the actual work]. The Sifrei (here) says the same as well: This teaches the praise of Moshe — he did as Hashem commanded him. Rashi, however, explains here: “The one who made it [referring to Betzalel].

One might have thought that only the proselytes who went out from Egypt, i.e., the mixed multitude, would be the ones to bring a Pesach-offering, because they were included in the miracle of the Exodus. Proselytes who converted afterwards in the Wilderness or in the Land of Israel, though, would not be obligated to bring a Pesach-offering, for neither they nor their forefathers were taken out of Egypt — “And us He took out of there” (Devarim 6:23).

The verse teaches us that even if the Cloud tarried on the <i>Mishkon</i> many days and yet the place of the encampment did not find favor in their eyes, so they wanted very much to leave, nevertheless, they would not transgress on the word of Hashem. And this is the explanation of the continuation: <b>Bnei Yisroel would keep the watch of Hashem and they would not travel</b> — due to their fear of Hashem, and because they wanted to keep His commands, they would not travel. Similarly, if the Cloud rested only a few days, and the nation was still very tired from the efforts of traveling, nevertheless, they would do the will of Hashem and travel after the Cloud. The Torah continues to relate (v. 21) that sometimes they camped only one night and traveled in the morning, although this was a great burden on them. And sometimes the Cloud rested a day and a night, which means they walked the entire night and came to the place of their encampment in the morning, where the Cloud rested for the entire day and the following night, and the next morning it lifted and they traveled. This was an even greater burden than the previous case, because they thought they were going to stay there and they unloaded the wagons and unpacked all their possessions, as people are wont to do when they return from their travels. When the Cloud lifted in the morning they had to repack everything, and had no time to make preparations for the trip. And sometimes the Cloud rested for two days (v. 22) and they had to travel from there at night. It could be that only the occurrences recorded here happened during their travels, and no other occurrence. That is, it happened that the Cloud rested overnight, or one day and one night, or two days, or a month or year. Therefore, the verse specifies these times. However, it did happen that the Cloud rested for many years, as mentioned here (v. 22): “The Cloud prolonged its stay above the <i>Mishkon</i>” — many years. This happened in Kodeish, as it says (Devarim 1:46): “You lived in Kodeish many years”."

This is because Hashem gives a new name to His servants. Moshe asked him to go with them, and mentioned, “We will treat you well” without specifying what it would be. Yisro thought he would receive a portion of the spoils — gold and silver, garments, flocks and cattle — but he would not have an inheritance among the Bnei Yisroel. Therefore, Yisro was not interested, and he answered: <b>But rather to my land and to my birthplace will I go</b> — for there I have an estate, property and honor. Moshe replied: <b>Please do not forsake us, for, because you know of our encampment in the desert and you will be our eyes</b> — that is, since you are familiar with the Wilderness you will be our eyes in conquering the lands, and you will show us the way to go. <b>And it will be, that when you go with us, it shall be that the very good which Hashem will bestow on us we will bestow on you</b> — With this Moshe hinted that he would be given an inheritance in the good land, as reward for his efforts and assistance in conquering the Land. In my opinion Chovav agreed to Moshe’s request because of this promise, as I mentioned (Shemos 18:1). And thus we find in the Yerushalmi as well (Bikurim 1,4): “The sons of Chovav, Moshe’s father-in-law, bring [first fruits] and read [the <i>parshah</i>], as it says, ‘Come along with us and we will treat you well’”."

The verse is saying that they spoke sinful speech. This is not correct, though, because if so, why does the verse hide their sin? Why does it not inform about it as it does in every other place? What appears correct to me is that when Bnei Yisroel traveled away from Mount Sinai, which was close to civilization, and entered the immense and awesome wilderness on their first travel, they were pained. They complained: What can we do? How can we live in this wilderness? What will we eat and drink? How can we bear the struggle and infliction, and when will we leave the wilderness?."

                    "<b>Send, for yourself.</b> According to the view of the Sages, the Bnei Yisroel sinned when they asked: “Let us send men before us.” They saw Hashem’s continuous deliverance and they should have been willing to follow after the Cloud wherever it would go. Moshe accepted their demand in order to fill their desires. According to this, the explanation of the statement (Devorim 1:23), “The idea pleased me,” is that Moshe restrained himself upon hearing their ill-advised words and instructed them to go ahead with it. Hashem then commanded him to send twelve spies, one from each tribe. This is similar to what Hashem said to Shmuel: “Listen to the voice of the people, according to all that they will say to you, for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected Me from reigning over them” (Shmuel I 8:7). Hashem did not specify the names of these leaders, as He did regarding the counting (1:5-15) and by the division of the Land (34:19-28), because fulfillment of Hashem’s commands never results in failure — “Whoever keeps the commandment shall know no evil thing” (Kohelles 8:5). What happened was that Hashem commanded Moshe to send one man from each tribe and that they should be leaders, and Moshe chose these men on his own. Thereupon, they brought evil on themselves of their own free will."

                    "<b>Korach took.</b> Rabbi Avraham (Ibn Ezra) wrote. “This event took place in the Sinai desert when the firstborn were exchanged for the Levites. The Bnei Yisroel thought that Moshe did this on his own accord, because he wanted to uplift his bother Aharon, the sons of Kehos, his relatives, and all the sons of Levi, his family. The Levites rose up against him because they were slated to be under the authority of Aharon and his sons. Dasan and Aviram rebelled because Moshe took away the rights of the firstborn from their father Reuven and gave them to Yosef. Korach was a firstborn as well.” In this, Rabbi Avraham follows his view that the Torah was written without regard to chronological order. However, I wrote (at the beginning of Parshas Acharei Mos) that in my opinion the entire Torah is written in chronological order, except for the places in which Scripture notes explicitly that it is out of order. In those places it is because of a certain need or suitable reason. Consequentially, the correct explanation here is that this event occurred in the Paran desert, at Kodeish Barnea, after the incident of the spies. The real reason for Korach’s rebellion is as explained in Midrash Rabbah and Tanchuma — Korach was angry about the appointment of Elitzafan to leadership. He was also envious of Aharon, as it says (v. 10), “And yet you ask to be <i>kohanim </i>as well?” Dasan and Aviram did not join with Korach because Moshe took away the right of the firstborn from the tribe of Reuven, for it was their forefather Yaakov who took it away from Reuven and gave it to Yosef. Rather, they stated their complaint (v. 13): “To kill us in the desert” and (v. 14), “Even into a land flowing with milk and honey you have not brought us.” As long as the Bnei Yisroel were in the Sinai desert, no bad event occurred, for even the very severe Sin of the Golden Calf resulted in relatively few deaths. The rest of the people were saved through Moshe’s prayers, which lasted forty days and forty nights (Devorim 9:28). Consequentially, the nation loved Moshe with all their soul, and obeyed him. If someone would have rebelled at that time he would have been stoned by the people. Therefore, Korach bided his time and refrained from reacting to Aharon’s appointment as <i>Kohein Gadol</i>. In the same way, the firstborn refrained from reacting to the elevation of the Levites and all of Moshe’s actions. However, when they arrived in the Paran desert many were burnt in Taveirah (11:1) and died in Kivros Hataavoh (11:33). When they sinned with the spies, Moshe did not succeed in annulling the decree with his prayer, and the leaders of the tribes died in a plague before Hashem. It was decreed upon the entire people to die in the wilderness. As a result, the people were embittered, and they began to feel that all their failures came as a result of Moshe’s leadership. Korach saw his opportunity now to dispute with Moshe, and he reasoned the people would listen to him. Thus, this is the explanation of Dasan and Aviram’s statement: “To kill us in the desert.” They claimed: You have brought us to this place, and you have not fulfilled the promise to bring us to a land flowing with milk and honey. You have not given us any inheritance at all. We will die in this desert and be annihilated here, and even our children will never leave this desert, for just as you have not fulfilled your promise to us, you will never fulfill your promise to our children."

I never took even one donkey for my needs, the way kings and ministers do. This is indeed the prerogative of kings, as in: “And your donkeys he will take, and put them to his work” (Shmuel I 8:16). This follows Targum Onkelos: Did I sequester (שחרית) — forced labor of the king is called שחוור. Moshe first mentioned that even a small item, such as a donkey, he never took as the king’s right, and then he continued: Nor have I done ill to any one of them — to harness him to my carriage or to subjugate him to my work, as a king will do; nor did I distort the judgment of any of them or shame him.

                    "<b>Moshe said to Korach: You and your entire congregation will be before Adonoy.</b> This was already stated above (v. 5-7). The explanation is that first Moshe said to them: “Do this: Take, for yourselves fire pans, Korach and his entire congregation… and it will be that the man who will be chosen by Adonoy, he is the holy one.” Moshe did not mention that Aharon would be with them. They were silent, indicating that they did not accept this for the following reason: If Aharon would be there with us, then whether the fire would come down for all of us, or whether it would not come down at all, we would all be equal. But if Aharon will not be there with us, and the fire will not come down, then Bnei Yisroel will say that this proves Hashem has not chosen us, whereas He has chosen Aharon, for the fire already came down for Aharon’s offerings on the eighth day (Vayikro 9:24). However, we will still have a complaint against Moshe — he should not have chosen Aharon alone to be <i>kohein</i>, for the fire did not come down in Aharon’s merit, but rather in the merit of the entire Jewish people who made the <i>Mishkon</i>, and it would have come down for any emissary of the congregation, for at that time the firstborn had not yet been replaced. For this reason Korach would not agree to any test without Aharon being there. When Moshe spoke to Korach and his congregation the first time (v. 6-7), Dasan and Aviram were also present. They were included in the command: “Take, for yourselves, fire pans, Korach and his entire congregation.” However, after Moshe sent for them and they refused, Moshe was extremely distressed, and he decided to decree that they should not meet their death as any other man. Then Moshe said to Korach a second time (v. 17): “Each man will take his firepan … two hundred and fifty firepans, and you and Aharon will each take his own firepan.” He thus eliminated Dasan and Aviram, and added Aharon. Korach agreed to this because he thought as a result they would all be equal."

This is the explanation of (v. 33), “and the earth covered them,” and therefore it says: “The ground beneath them split.

The same question can be asked about the earlier verse (16:21): “Separate yourselves from among this congregation.” We know that Hashem is able to kill many people with a plague surrounding one righteous person and leave him alone alive. This happened with the firstborn of Egypt, as well as the other plagues, where there would be three people sleeping in one bed, two of them would die and the middle one would escape with his life. The answer here is that Hashem, in His anger, intended to kill the entire congregation in the same death as these sinners, since they followed after them — either with opening of the earth’s mouth or through the fire that went out before Him. These were general plagues that in the natural sense would kill all those standing there together, unless Hashem made a special miracle to save them [and Hashem wished to minimize the miracle]. Another explanation is that the Holy One said this to honor the righteous ones, for as long as they were among them He would not strike them. Hashem’s intention with these warnings was to inform them that Yisroel needed their prayers for mercy and atonement. Moshe immediately hurried Aharon to offer the incense for atonement."

This is because the nation only needed a proof that the tribe of Levi was chosen of all the tribes of Israel, as I explained earlier (end of v. 6)."

Therefore, the correct explanation is that the staff would be preserved as a symbol that the tribe of Levi was chosen instead of the firstborn. The fire that burned the 250 men was proof for the <i>kehunah</i>, and the staff’s blossoming was proof for the Levite service, as I explained (v. 6 and 17).

Alternatively, Moav knew this because they heard Hashem's restriction to Bnei Yisroel not to afflict Moav (v. 9). Therefore, Moav said to the elders of Midian: Even if they do not overtake our land, since they are so numerous they will lick up everything around us, just as the ox laps up the herbs of the field. They will overtake everything around us just as they did to the two Emorite kings, and they will force us to be slave labor."

                    "<b>To Balak’s dignitaries.</b> According to Rashi's commentary, the elders of Midian departed when Bil'am told them to spend the night here. It could also be true that when Bil'am told them, according to what Adonoy tells me, they did not wish to wait for him. For they understood that Hashem is constantly a help to the Jewish People — He is the One who took them out of Egypt, and He performed signs and wonders for them. Furthermore, the elders of Midian were wise and certainly knew of the discussions that took place between Moshe and Yisro, although the verse does not mention this. Rabbi Avraham (Ibn Ezra) explains differently. He says that the elders of Midian are not mentioned because Balak [king of Moav] is the main subject and sent the messengers. Likewise [Midian is not mentioned in the verse], And the dignitaries of Moav remained, since it was primarily [Balak] the king of Moav who sent them. It is feasible that the elders of Midian — who were perhaps those first emissaries — came to Balak from their land to consult with him regarding the Bnei Yisroel and, all together, they decided to send dignitaries to Bil'am. But then Balak sent his own dignitaries, officers, and wise men who traveled together with the elders of Midian to Midian on the way to Bil'am's city. However, the elders of Midian remained in their city whereas the dignitaries sent by Balak — who alone were the emissaries — traveled onward to Aram. This is the meaning of, And the elders of Moav and Midian went (v. 7), that they all departed from Balak together and traveled until Midian. Then, they came to Bil’am, (ibid.) refers only to the elders of Moav, for the earlier verse He sent emissaries, (v. 5) refers to them but not to the elders of Midian."

                    "<b>If the men have come to call you.</b> It seems correct to explain the matter as follows: At the beginning Hashem prevented Bil'am so that he should not curse the Jewish People for they are blessed. Why, then, should he go with them since he will not curse them and they did not need him for any other purpose? This is what Hashem said to him (v. 12), Do not go with them! You shall not curse the people, for they are blessed.” Bil'am certainly informed them of Hashem's response. Afterwards, Balak sent emissaries to him a second time because he did not believe the response. Rather, he honored Bil'am even more with dignitaries who were greater in number and of higher rank, and he promised to increase his honor and reward. Bil'am responded that the matter does not depend on money or on his willingness. Rather, everything is in Hashem's hands. Bil'am then asked Hashem again what He shall command him, which was acceptable of him to do so. For what did Bil'am know of Hashem's intentions? It is always good to seek counsel from Hashem, as He guides [even] sinners along the [proper] path. Hashem could certainly inform him what to respond to the emissaries, or He could tell Bil'am a prediction for the future. And behold, Hashem said to Bil'am, I have already make known to you that you shall not be able to curse the people, for they are blessed. But now that they have returned to you, if the men have come <b>only to call you.</b> In other words, if they desire that you go with them on condition that you do not curse the people, as I informed you from the beginning, arise and go with them.<b> However, whatever I will say to you, you will do</b> — even if I shall command you to bless the people, you will do so with no fear of Balak. This is the meaning of, <b>if the men have come to call you.</b> This was Hashem's intention from the beginning, that Bil'am should go with the emissaries after he informed them that he will not curse the people and that he will conduct himself only as Hashem commands him, for Hashem's desire is that Israel should receive a blessing from the prophet of the Nations. It was incumbent upon Bil'am to relate this to Balak's dignitaries and say to them, Behold, Hashem has permitted me only to answer your call — but on condition that I shall not curse the people, and also on condition that if Hashem shall command me to bless them that I shall do so. If you are not satisfied with this, then leave me. For Balak had said a second time, if you would just please come and curse this people for me” (v. 17). He did not want Bil'am to predict the future or any purpose except to curse the people. Bil'am, due to his great desire to go with them, did not inform them of this; he said nothing to them. Instead, Bil’am arose in the morning, saddled his donkey, and went with the Moavite dignitaries (v. 21). Therefore, Hashem showed anger because he went (v. 22). If Bil'am would have informed them, he would not have gone. Furthermore, Bil'am besmirched the name of Hashem by going with them because, in going with them under the impression that Hashem had given approval, the emissaries thought that Hashem had granted permission to curse the people and that He retracted what He said at first, You shall not curse the people, for they are blessed” (v. 12), as Bil'am had said to them. When the emissaries saw yet again that Bil'am would not curse them, they thought that afterwards Hashem would change His mind again, or that He was teasing them as a person might do, and Heaven forbid to think that Hashem acts in such a way; Hashem is eternally the God of Israel."

Rather, this People has a single Torah and a single law; it is a single nation. They dwell alone under the name Yaakov and Yisroel. For this reason, he said (v. 23:7), Come, curse Yaakov for me; go, invoke wrath against Yisroel. He mentioned their distinguished name and the name of their patriarchs in order to emphasize that they are a lone nation, and that they have beautiful names which they received from their patriarchs. For Balak did not mention the name Yisroel. Rather, he only said that (v. 22:5), a nation came out of Egypt, acting as if he does not know them; he was ungrateful for the good that Avraham had done for Lot, their ancestor.

[Since Hashem now appeared to Bil'am through the attribute of mercy] this explains the verse (24:1), When Bil'am saw that it was favorable to Adonoy to bless Yisroel, for also Adonoy [the attribute of mercy] is bestowing goodness through the blessing.

Rather, he died by his sin alone, without provoking others to sin with him.” However, Rashi did not explain why they needed to say he died because of his own sin. They could have simply said, “Our father died in the Wilderness without leaving any sons.” According to the view of our Sages (Baba Basra 117b) they needed to say he was not part of Korach’s assembly, because Korach’s assembly lost their portion in the Land of Israel, as did the complainers. The daughters knew this because the Beis Din of Moshe spread this information among the people. Rabbi Avraham (Ibn Ezra) explained this way as well, and wrote that the daughters thought that the group that banded together against Hashem would not inherit in the Land. In my view, according to the plain meaning, they said this because they thought Moshe hated Korach’s assembly more than all the other sinners who died in the Wilderness, since they rebelled against him and denounced all his deeds. They thought that maybe Moshe would say about Korach’s assembly, due to his hatred of them: “May he have none who extends kindness, and may no one be gracious to his orphans” (Tehillim 109:12); “May the iniquity against his forefathers be remembered by Adonoy” (ibid. 14). Therefore, the daughters informed him that their father was not a part of that assembly, and hinted that he was not among those who died in the plague; rather, he died in the Wilderness upon his bed. The meaning of, but he died because of his own sin, was that he died because of his sin in the Wilderness and did not merit to enter the Land."

The reason Moshe was commanded not to teach everyone these laws was so that they would not be too lenient with vows. Therefore, Moshe taught these laws only to the wise men of Yisroel, the tribal leaders. Furthermore, this verse hints at the statement of the Sages (Nedarim 78a) that the tribal leaders have more power in releasing vows than the rest of the nation, for a single expert judge can release a vow. The matter of releasing vows was not mentioned explicitly in the Torah; it is a <i>halachah l’Moshe m’Sinai</i>."

They are defined in tractate Nedarim.” Rashi spoke briefly, for indeed the husband annuls vows which are of self-denial, for example, if she said, “the fruits of the world are prohibited to me.” Included in this is even if she vowed not to taste one type of fruit. However, besides these vows, the husband can annul matters between him and her even if they do not involve self-denial. For example, if she said I will not use eye mascara, or remove hair, or engage in marital relations. About these things it says (v. 17): “regarding a man and his wife,” as stated in Nedarim (79b)."

We learn from here that one who causes another’s downfall must bear full punishment in his place.” The source of this is the Sifrei. It appears that this refers to a woman who violated her vow unintentionally or mistakenly. That is, the Torah speaks about a husband who heard about her vow and the woman did not know he heard. On a later day, he nullified it and told her that this was the day he heard about it. The Torah teaches two things here: 1) The husband bears the transgression as if he himself made a vow and transgressed it. 2) She is exempt and is not punished even for an unintentional sin. If, however, the woman knew that her husband did not annul on the day he heard about the vow, and she knows the law in this case, she is liable, and her husband did not cause her downfall. He will be punished only as one who could have protested and did not protest. The Torah mentions this in conjunction with a husband, but the same applies to a father. However, the Torah speaks about the usual case, for a father will usually not cause a downfall because he loves his daughter, but a husband might hate his wife and want to try to cause her to be guilty."

He conquered the two great Emorite kings and apportioned their land for an inheritance. Thus, he was selected to take vengeance from the enemies of Hashem. Yehoshua, in contrast, had only the leadership roles that related to Eretz Yisroel. There was another reason Hashem gave Moshe the responsibility for this war. It was to honor him by allowing him to see the revenge enacted, as it says, “The righteous man will rejoice because he saw revenge” (Tehillim 58:11). These two reasons are the explanation of: Afterward you shall be gathered to your people. Moshe honored Pinchas, who had begun the mitzvah [when he killed Kosbi] and had the responsibility to finish the mitzvah. Moshe appointed Pinchas as the <i>kohein meshuach milchamah</i>—anointed for war. It was not appropriate to appoint Elozor, because he was the Kohein Gadol."

However, Moshe suspected that they were afraid of the Canaanites, about whom the spies had said (13:31): “We are not able to go up against the nation, for they are more powerful than we.” Therefore, he told them that they do not trust Hashem, as their forefathers, and Hashem will punish them as He did their forefathers, “He will again place them in the wilderness.” And so they answered: God forbid that we should fear them.

The Torah speaks of awesome and wondrous miracles: Yisroel was in the Wilderness forty years and found manna every day. They journeyed in places far from civilization, places where there was no natural way for them to live, for it was “not a place of seed, figs, grapes, or pomegranates” (20:5). The Torah relates (Devorim 29:5): “Bread have you not eaten, neither fresh nor aged wine have you drunk.” All these things were open miracles that were seen to the eye. Since the Creator knew that these miracles would be affected by the same process [of forgetfulness and denial] that affects all historical events. He was concerned that the people who heard about them would not believe them. They would think that the places where Yisroel stayed were close to civilization and people could exist normally in them, like the desert places where the Arabs live today. Or perhaps they were places where they could plow and harvest, or there were herbs and plants for human consumption, and there were wells for water. Therefore, Hashem distanced such thoughts from people’s hearts. He strengthened the belief in these miracles by mentioning the journeys, so that the following generations would see the places and realize the great miracles that sustained Yisroel in those places forty years. These are the words of Rambam."

Thus, they must be careful not to pollute the Land."
