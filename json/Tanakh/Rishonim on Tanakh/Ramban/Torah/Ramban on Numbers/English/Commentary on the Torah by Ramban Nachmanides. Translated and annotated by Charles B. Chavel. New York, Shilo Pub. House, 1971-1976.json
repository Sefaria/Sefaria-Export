            "‘B’MIDBAR SINAI’ (IN THE WILDERNESS OF SINAI). After having explained the laws of the offerings in the third book, He now began to set forth in this book the commandments which they [the children of Israel] were told with reference to the Tent of Meeting. Now He had already given a warning for all times about [the prohibition of] impurity relating to the Sanctuary and its holy things.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 5:2-3. See Ramban there (Vol. III pp. 52-54).</i> Here He defined the boundaries of the Tabernacle whilst it was in the wilderness, just as He had set bounds for Mount Sinai when the [Divine] Glory was there,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 19:12. Ramban here, in stressing the parallels between the Tent of Meeting and Mount Sinai, is developing the idea that he mentions in Exodus at the beginning of <i>Seder Terumah</i>, that the Tent of Meeting was, as it were, a continuation of Mount Sinai. See Vol. II p. 435.</i> and He commanded <i>that the common man that draweth nigh shall be put to death</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 1:51.</i> just as He had said there, <i>no hand shall touch him</i> [i.e., the mountain], <i>but he shall surely be stoned</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 19:13.</i> He also commanded [here], <i>And they shall not go in to see the holy things as they are being covered, lest they die</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 4:20.</i> just as He warned there [at Sinai], <i>lest they break through unto the Eternal to gaze, and many of them perish</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 19:21.</i> He commanded here. <i>And ye shall keep the charge of the holy things and the charge of the altar</i>, [<i>that there be wrath no more upon the children of Israel</i>],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 18:5.</i> just as He said there, <i>And let the priests also, that come near to the Eternal, sanctify themselves, lest the Eternal break forth upon them;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 19:22.</i> <i>and let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the Eternal, lest He break forth upon them</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 24.</i> Thus He commanded [here] how the Tabernacle and its vessels are to be guarded, and how they [the people] are to pitch round about it and how the people are to stand afar off, and how <i>the priests that come near the Eternal</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 19:22.</i> are to treat it [the Tabernacle] when it is resting and when it is being carried [during the journeyings], and how they are to guard it. Now these are all [signs of] distinction and honor for the Sanctuary, just as the Rabbis of blessed memory have said,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifre Zuta <i>Korach</i> 18:4.</i> “A King’s palace<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“And it is known that the term ‘palace’ is a reference to the Sanctuary” (“The Commandments,” Vol. I, p. 31). — It is possible, on first thought, to explain Ramban’s expression “and how they are to pitch round about it” that the pronoun “they” refers to all the Levites, and in that case the continuing expression “and how <i>the people</i> are to stand afar off” would thus complete the thought by contrast: the Levites are to encamp round about the Tabernacle, while the people are to stand afar off. But see in Chapter 2, Verse 2, that Scripture speaks clearly of <i>the children of Israel</i> encamping round about the Tabernacle. Hence the words of Ramban are to be understood as follows: the people are to pitch round about the Tabernacle, and when they approach it they are to stand afar off. This interpretation is fully borne out in the following chapters of this book of the Torah.</i> that has guards over it cannot be compared to a palace that has no such guards.”",
            "Now this whole book deals only with those commandments which were meant only for a particular time, being the period when the Israelites stayed in the desert, and [it deals also] with the miracles which were done for them, in order to tell all the wondrous deeds of the Eternal which He wrought for them. It tells how He began to destroy their enemies before them by the sword, and He also commanded how the Land should be divided up amongst them. There are no commandments in this book which are binding for all times except for some commandments about the offerings which He had begun in the Book of [the Law of] the Priests [i.e., Leviticus], and whose explanation was not completed there, therefore He finished them in this book."

                    "FROM TWENTY YEARS OLD AND UPWARD, ‘KOL YOTZEI TZAVA’ (ALL THAT ARE ABLE TO GO FORTH TO THE HOST) IN ISRAEL. “This tells us that no one under the age of twenty goes forth to the host. <i>‘Se’u eth rosh’</i> [literally: ‘take the head’ and generally translated: <i>take ye the sum</i>] <i>of all the congregation of Israel</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 2.</i> This is as one says to an executioner: ‘take that man’s head’.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The meaning of this text which stems from Bamidbar Rabbah 1:9 will be explained further on by Ramban. The final quote is not found in our texts of Rashi, although Ramban quotes it from his commentary. The reason for its disappearance from all other texts of Rashi may well be its sharpness of expression which on first sight baffles the student. Ramban, however, recognizing that it is a genuine text which stems from Midrash Rabbah proceeds to explain it appropriately.</i> This is Rashi’s language.<br>Perhaps the reason for this [law that a male under twenty years old was not liable to military service] is because he is not strong enough for war under the age of twenty, as the Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Aboth 5:21.</i> “Twenty is the age for pursuit.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew is <i>lirdof</i>, which is variously interpreted as: “for seeking a livelihood:” or “for seeking one’s life-pursuit.” Ramban here understands it in its literal sense — “to pursue [the enemy in battle].”</i> But it may be that the meaning of the phrase <i>kol yotzei tzava</i> is “all who go forth to be assembled in the congregation,” because the young men do not take part in such an assembly of the people, and every gathering of the people is called <i>tzava</i>, as in ‘[<i>litzvo</i>] <i>tzava</i>’ (<i>to be counted among the host</i>) <i>for the work of the Tent of Meeting;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 8:24.</i> <i>he shall return from the ‘tz’va’ of the work;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 25.</i> <i>with the mirrors of the ‘tzov’oth’ that ‘tzav’u’</i> (<i>women that congregated together</i>);<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 38:8.</i> and similarly <i>‘tz’va’</i> (<i>the host of</i>) <i>heaven;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 4:19.</i> <i>and all ‘tz’va’am’</i> (<i>their host</i>) <i>I commanded</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 45:12.</i> Therefore Scripture explains when speaking of men of war: <i>‘mi’tz’va’</i> (<i>from the host of</i>) <i>the war;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 31:14.</i> <i>and the number of them reckoned ‘bi’tz’va’</i> (<i>by the host</i>) <i>for the war</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Chronicles 7: 40.</i> Scripture states here <i>all that go forth to the host</i>, similar to what it says, <i>all that went out of the gate of the city</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 34: 24. Ramban’s meaning is that the intention of the verses is: “all that are able to go,” even if they have not actually gone.</i> It states, <i>ye shall number them by their ‘hosts’</i> [in the plural], because they consisted of many hosts, since each and every tribe was a great host.<br>But as for Rashi’s expression when he wrote — “This is as one says to an executioner: ‘take that man’s head’” — it is not clear to me why the Sages should interpret the verse in this derogatory manner. If it is because [the people counted here] died in the desert [therefore He said, <i>take the head …</i>] whereas in the case of the tribe of Levi He said <i>Number the children of Levi</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 3: 15.</i> since they were not included in the decree [that they die in the desert] — [this cannot be so], for in the second census [taken] of those who <i>were</i> to come into the Land it also uses the same [expression], <i>take the head of all the congregation of the children of Israel</i>!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 26:2.</i> But in the Agadah (homiletic exposition) of Vayikra Rabbah<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I did not find it there. But a similar exposition is found in Bamidbar Rabbah 1:7. See my Hebrew commentary p. 196, Note 26 for the full text.</i> the Rabbis explain it as an expression of praise [for the people]: “The term <i>se’u</i> always means ‘greatness’, as it is written, <i>Pharaoh ‘yisa’</i> (<i>shall lift up</i>) <i>thy head, and restore thee unto thy office</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 40:13.</i> Said the Holy One, blessed be He, to Israel: ‘I have given you an exaltation of the head, and I have likened you to Myself. Just as I am exalted above all inhabitants of the world, as it is said, <i>Thine is the kingdom, O Eternal, and Thou art exalted as head above all</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Chronicles 29:11.</i> so to you also I have given an elevation of the head, as it is said, <i>Lift up the head of all the congregation of the children of Israel</i>, thus fulfilling that which is said, <i>And He hath lifted up a horn for His people</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 148:14.</i> and similarly it is said, <i>and the Eternal thy G-d will set thee on high above all the nations of the earth</i>. ' ”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 28:1.</i><br>I have found further in Bamidbar Sinai Rabbah that the Sages have stated:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Bamidbar Rabbah 1:9.</i> “Said Rabbi Pinchas in the name of Rabbi Idi: What is [the meaning of] that which is written at the beginning of this book, <i>‘se’u eth rosh’</i> (<i>take the head</i>)? It does not say: ‘lift up the head,’ ‘elevate the head,’ but it says <i>se’u eth rosh</i>, like a man who says to an executioner: ‘take this man’s head’. Here He gave a hint to Moses, <i>se’u eth rosh</i>, meaning that if the people are worthy they will become exalted, just as it is written, <i>Pharaoh ‘yisa’</i> (<i>shall lift up</i>) <i>thy head, and restore thee unto thy office;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 40:13.</i> but if they are not worthy, they will all die, just as it is written, <i>Pharaoh ‘yisa’</i> (<i>shall lift up</i>) <i>thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree. ”</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 40:19.</i> Thus the expression [<i>se’u eth rosh</i> which, as Rashi explained, is used in connection with execution] is to be interpreted according to the intention [of the speaker] — in a good way for those who are good.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Psalms 125:4: <i>Do good, O Eternal, unto the good</i>. Thus Pharaoh said unto the chief executioner: “Take the chief butler and lift up his head and restore him to his office.” <i>But as for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the Eternal will lead them away with the workers of iniquity</i> (<i>ibid.</i>, Verse 5). Thus in the case of the chief baker, the same expression signified his downfall. In short, the expression of the Midrash which Rashi quoted can be interpreted either for bad or for good. And since it is an expression of elevation etc.</i> And since it is [also] an expression of elevation, and it is used [here] in the first census, He used the same expression in the second census.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 26:2.</i>",
                    "TIPHKEDU OTHAM.’ The term <i>p’kidah</i> is an expression meaning remembrance of and attention to a certain matter, as in the phrase, <i>And the Eternal ‘pakad’</i> (<i>remembered</i>) <i>Sarah as He had said</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 21:1. See Ramban there (Vol. I, p. 268).</i> and this in my opinion is its interpretation in all places, without any exception. The expression <i>pikadon</i> [which means a bailment or deposit of goods] is also [from this root], because his guarding and supervision is on it [i.e., because the bailee must guard it]. And therefore when He commanded that Israel be counted He stated <i>tiphkedu otham</i>, in order to hint that he [Moses] was not to count them [by persons] but that they were each to give <i>half a shekel as a ransom for</i> their <i>soul</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 30:12-13.</i> and he should supervise them [the half-shekels] and thereby know the number of the people. In the case of David Scripture states: <i>the sum of ‘miphkad’</i> (<i>the numbering</i>) <i>of the people</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Samuel 24:9.</i> because he knew their numbers through the counting of [the half-shekel] ransom [that each one gave]. For it appears to me unlikely that David should not be careful about that which Scripture states, <i>that there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 30:12.</i> And even if David did perhaps make a mistake,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Exodus, at the beginning of <i>Seder Ki Thisa</i>, Ramban in fact does explain that David made a mistake and did indeed count them without half-shekels [a theory to which he reverts here briefly at the end of the verse]. For the reason for his mistake, see <i>ibid.</i>, (Vol. II, p. 511).</i> why did Joab [the captain of the host in charge of the census] not take [the census through] shekels, <i>for the king’s word was abominable to Joab</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Chronicles 21:6.</i> and Joab [in fact] said to the king, <i>Why doth my lord require this thing? Why will he be a cause of guilt unto Israel?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 3.</i> So why did he [Joab] not count them through the shekels, so that he should not sin?<br>But in my opinion the [Divine] wrath was [aroused] against him [David] because he counted them unnecessarily, since he was not going forth to war, nor did he do anything with them [the men he counted, so that he would need to know their number] at that time, and [the census] was only to make him rejoice that he ruled over a large people. Therefore Joab said [to David], <i>Now the Eternal thy G-d add unto the people, how many soever they may be, a hundredfold, and may the eyes of my lord the king see it; but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Samuel 24:3.</i> And I have seen in Bamidbar Sinai Rabbah:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Bamidbar Rabbah 2:17.</i> “Rabbi Eliezer in the name of Rabbi Yosei ben Zimra said: Whenever Israel was counted for a purpose, their numbers did not diminish; but when they were counted for no purpose, they became diminished. When were they counted for a purpose? In the days of Moses, and<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In our Midrash Rabbah the word “and” is not found in the Hebrew text, so that it refers to only one, not two times: “When were they counted for a purpose? In the days of Moses for the [setting up of the] standards” as described here in Chapter 2. See, however, Rashi on Verse 1 above, who is of the opinion that the people were counted at the exodus from Egypt (Exodus 12:37), and again after the worship of the golden calf to ascertain the number of those left. In that case Ramban’s version in the text of Bamidbar Rabbah is fully understandable, for there were numberings in the days of Moses preceding the one at the time of setting up the standards.</i> for the [setting up of the] standards and at the division of the Land.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Chapter 26; <i>ibid.</i>, Verse 53.</i> [When were they counted] for no purpose? In the days of David.”<br>It is also possible to say by way of explanation that David commanded that every “man” in Israel be counted, meaning thereby to include everyone above the age of thirteen years old, who is regarded as “a man” [and not from the age of twenty years upwards], since it is nowhere mentioned in [describing] his counting: “from twenty years old and upwards”, but instead David said, <i>Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan … that I may know the sum of them</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Chronicles 21:2.</i> And this was [the reason for] his punishment, for Scripture only allowed counting to be done <i>from twenty years old and upwards</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 30:14.</i> by means of the shekels. It was because this is not clearly expressed in Scripture [that even by means of the half-shekels the people are only to be counted from the age of twenty years and over] that David made this mistake, for he thought that when Scripture says <i>that there be no plague among them</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 30:12.</i> it is because of the shekels, which are a ransom [of the soul] for them [and therefore he thought that as long as he counted them by means of the shekels and not by direct census there would be no plague even if he counted them from above the age of thirteen years old, instead of twenty], but Joab applied his heart [to understand the matter] and was concerned because of it.<br>And Scripture [itself] stirs me to this thought by saying: <i>But David took not the number of them from twenty years old and under, because the Eternal had said He would increase Israel like to the stars of heaven. Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but finished not; and there came wrath for this upon Israel</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Chronicles 27:23-24. It is apparent that Ramban interprets these verses as follows: <i>But David took not the number of them from twenty years old ‘and under’</i> because <i>Joab began … but finished not</i> for the reason that he [Joab] applied his heart to understand the matter and was concerned about the breach of the law in taking the census from twenty years old and under.</i> From this it appears that Joab’s census included those under twenty years old, and this was [the reason for] the “wrath”, because G-d does not want all Israel to be limited by numbers since He will multiply them like the stars of heaven, as He said [to Abraham], <i>Look now toward heaven, and count the stars, if thou be able to count them</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 15:5.</i> And when the verse says concerning that census [of Joab], <i>And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and a hundred thousand men that drew sword</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Chronicles 21:5.</i> it does not mean to say that they were all eligible for military service [since, as explained above, they included also thirteen-year olds who do not go to war], but its correct interpretation is that they were all sufficiently healthy and strong to be able to go to battle, thus stating that he did not count the sick, the weak, and the old, because <i>the king’s word was abominable to</i> him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Chronicles 21:6.</i> This interpretation is very appropriate.<br>But according to the opinion of the Midrash Agadah [a homiletic exposition<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Berachoth 62 b: “And when he [David] counted them he did not take from them the ransom of soul etc.” This would seem to indicate that David’s mistake was that he counted them <i>by persons</i>, [from twenty years old and upwards], and not, as Ramban suggested above, because he included in the count [which <i>was</i> done with shekels] people under twenty but over thirteen years old.</i> from which it would appear] that there was an actual census [i.e., that the people were counted without the use of shekels, we must say that] they all erred. This is why David said [to Joab], <i>Go, ‘number’ Israel</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Samuel 24:1.</i> and it is further written, <i>after that he had ‘numbered’ the people</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 10.</i> [expressions which indicate that there was an actual counting of persons without using half-shekels], for in the Torah the term “numbering” of people is not mentioned at all, and the meaning of the expression <i>according to the number of names</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 2.</i> is that each one should tell his name when he is counted through bringing his ransom [of half a shekel]."

Scripture mentions [the date although it is already stated in Verse 1 above, to indicate] the zeal of our teacher Moses in [fulfilling] the command of G-d for on the very day of the communication [that he was to take a census of the people] he took the princes of the tribes and assembled all the congregation and began to count them. The count, however, was not completed in one day, and therefore He states again, <i>so did he number them in the wilderness of Sinai</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 19.</i> in order to inform [us] that the counting was all done in that place, but was not all [finished] on that day.",
                    "VA’YITHYALDU’ (AND THEY DECLARED THEIR PEDIGREES) AFTER THEIR FAMILIES. “They brought the documents of their genealogy and witnesses confirming the birth of each of them, so as to prove their descent from their [respective] tribes.” This is Rashi’s language. But it does not appear [correct to say] that they should have to bring genealogical documents and witnesses with regard to belonging to a [particular] tribe. Rather, <i>va’yithyaldu</i> means that they were counted by <i>their generations, by their families, by their fathers’ houses</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verses 20, 22, etc.</i> the sense thereof being to state that the whole congregation assembled, as Moses had commanded them by the order of the Holy One, blessed be He, at the door of the Tent of Meeting, except for <i>the mixed multitude</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 12:38.</i> who <i>were not of the children of Israel</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Samuel 21:2.</i> for they were recognizable amongst them from the day that they had gone out of Egypt. Thus each man in the congregation brought his [half-] shekel and said to Moses and the princes: “I so-and-so was born to such-and-such a person of such-and-such a family, which is of the tribe of Reuben,” or some other tribe, and Moses put the shekels of each particular tribe in a special place [to be counted later], so that he would know the sum of [each] individual [tribe] and of all the tribes together. And the proof for this<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., a proof that they did not have to bring their genealogical documents, as Rashi explained, but that <i>va’yithyaldu</i> means merely that they declared to which family and tribe they belonged, is that etc.</i> is that at the second census [taken when they were about to enter the Land of Israel] where the families [of each tribe] are mentioned,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., mentioned by name, in contrast to this census [taken at the arrangement of the people into four main groups headed by the four standards] where the names of the families of each tribe are not listed.</i> it does not say <i>va’yithyaldu</i>, nor does it mention <i>according to the number of names, by their polls</i>, [as it says here in Verse 19]. This is because ever since the tribes had pitched by their standards, they were separated from each other and it was clearly known to which tribe each family belonged; thus they only had to know how many families there were in each tribe, and each family counted its men <i>by their polls</i>, but not <i>according to the number of names</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">But if <i>va’yithyaldu</i> means, as Rashi explained that they were to produce their genealogical documents, the question arises why was that not required at the second census? According to Ramban, however, who explains that <i>va’yithyaldu</i> means that they each declared to which family and which tribe they belonged, we can understand why <i>va’yithyaldu</i> is not mentioned at the second census. For once they pitched by their standards, each person’s place would indicate to which tribe he belonged, and the families themselves counted their own numbers, whilst Moses counted the numbers of all the families. Hence it was no longer necessary to declare to which family and which tribe one belonged.</i> Therefore the princes of the tribes did not have to be present [with Moses] at that [second] census [as was stipulated at the first census — in Verse 4 — since the princes of the tribes were only needed in order to identify which families belonged to which tribe, and this was already known at the time of the second census]. And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra explains that <i>va’yithyaldu</i> means that they were asked when they were born, in order to ascertain whether they were [over] twenty years of age."

                    "AND ALL THOSE THAT WERE NUMBERED OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL BY THEIR FATHERS’ HOUSES … ALL THAT WERE ABLE TO GO FORTH TO WAR IN ISRAEL. It was necessary for Scripture to state the collective number of the people although it had already stated the individual numbers [of each of the tribes], because Moses and Aaron were commanded to ascertain the total number of the people counted, as well as the number of [people in] each tribe, for such is the way of kings when they take a census of their people.<br>However I have not understood the reason for this commandment, namely why the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded [that they should ascertain the number of the people]. For whilst there was indeed a need for them [the people] to establish their relationship to the [individual] tribes because of the [division of the tribes of Israel according to four] standards, I cannot understand why G-d commanded that they find out the number [of men in each tribe]. Perhaps it was in order to proclaim His mercy over them, for it was <i>with</i> [only] <i>threescore and ten persons</i> that their <i>fathers went down into Egypt</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">73</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Deuteronomy 10:22.</i> and now they were as the sand of the sea, so many men [above] the age of twenty [not to mention the women and children].

Verse 1; see also Bamidbar Rabbah 4:2.</i> “Because of His abundant love for them He counts them every now and then.” Furthermore, he who comes before the father of the prophets, and his brother [<i>Aaron</i>] <i>the holy one of the Eternal</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">77</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 106:16.</i> and becomes known to them by name, receives thereby a merit and life, because he has come <i>in the council of</i> the <i>people and in the register of the house of Israel</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">78</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 13:9. The prophet Ezekiel states it in the negative as a punishment for sinners: <i>they shall not be in the council of My people, neither shall they be written in the register of the house of Israel</i>. Ramban, as indicated, applies it in the positive, namely, that those possessing merit will be included in the council of G-d’s people and be written in the register of the house of Israel. It is possible that Ramban also hints to the concluding part of that verse: <i>neither shall they enter into the Land of Israel</i>, thus intimating that those who are deserving of reward will enter into the Land.</i> and he receives a part in the merits of the community by being included in their numbers. Similarly, each of the people receive a special merit through being counted by number before Moses and Aaron, for they <i>will set</i> their <i>eyes upon them for good</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">79</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 24:6.</i> and intercede on their behalf for mercy, [just as it is said], <i>The Eternal, the G-d of your fathers, make you a thousand times so many more as ye are</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">80</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 1:11.</i> and He will not reduce your numbers, and the shekels shall be a redemption for your souls.

[Thus He said]: You shall not say to the head of the family: ‘How many people are there in your family? How many sons do you have?’ but they are each to pass before you with awe and in respect, and you shall count them. — It is with reference to this that it is written, <i>according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, by their polls. ”</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">82</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 18 above.</i><br>It is also possible for us to say that [the reason for ascertaining their numbers] was similar to the practice of governments before fighting a war, since they were now ready to enter into the Land and to fight against the kings of the Amorite that were on the other side of the Jordan [eastward] and all the others, as Moses said [unto Hobab], <i>We are journeying unto the place of which the Eternal said: This I will give unto you</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">83</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 10:29.</i> Therefore Moses and the princes [of the tribes] had to know the number of those armed for war, and also the numbers of each and every tribe, [in order to decide] what to command each of them in the plains of Moab [when drawing up] the battle-lines, for the Torah does not rely on the miracle of one chasing a thousand.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">84</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Deuteronomy 32:30.</i> This is the purport of the expression, <i>all that go forth to the host in Israel</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">85</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 3.</i> namely that the census was for the purpose of [determining the number of] men that will go forth to war; and also so that he should distribute the Land to them according to their numbers, and should know how many parts will be allotted to them of the Land that they capture, since if not for the affair of the spies, they would have entered the Land immediately."

Therefore he was in doubt about the Levites and did not know what to do with them. And when he had finished all those who were counted of the people, and the Levites remained alone [uncounted], the Holy One, blessed be He, explained to him that he was not to count them <i>among the children of Israel</i> but that he should take their sum separately, for he was to <i>appoint</i> them <i>over the Tabernacle of the Testimony</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">87</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 50.</i><br>He stated <i>‘p’kod’</i> [<i>‘number’</i> — in the singular] <i>the children of Levi</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">88</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 3:15.</i> meaning that he [Moses] was to count them by himself without [the assistance of] the princes, and it was he [Moses] who called upon Aaron to be with him,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">89</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 39: <i>All that were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron numbered</i> etc. Thus it is clear that Aaron also participated in the counting of the Levites.

Each week a new <i>mishmar</i> of priests, Levites, and Israelites would arrive in Jerusalem to attend to the Divine Services in the Sanctuary. The Israelites’ function was to “stand by” the daily offerings brought for the whole congregation of Israel, for “how can a man’s offering be offered while he does not stand by it?” (Taanith 26a). Such a group of Israelites is referred to as a <i>ma’amad</i> (literally: “stand by”).

According to Rashi, the dots on the word <i>Aharon</i> indicate that “he was not in the census of the Levites,” which can be interpreted as saying that he did not participate in <i>counting</i> the people, and only Moses did it. Mizrachi in fact interprets Rashi in this way, since the verse [<i>whom Moses and Aaron counted</i>] refers to those who did the actual counting of the Levites, thus the dots on the word “Aaron” indicate that he did not participate in the counting — but he himself may well have <i>been counted</i>. Ramban’s language, however, clearly means that “Aaron himself <i>was not counted</i> at all in the census of the Levites.” This explains why Ramban does not quote this explanation of the Gemara in the name of Rashi, as he is wont to do, since his interpretation of the text of Bechoroth 4a is different than Rashi’s.</i>"

These twelve standards are not to be confused with the four main standards, around each of which three tribes rallied.</i> The color of each standard corresponded to that of the stone fixed in the breastplate [of the High Priest, on which the name of that tribe was engraved], and by this method everyone would recognize his standard.” This is Rashi’s language. But Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented: “There were signs on each of the [four main] standards. Thus the ancient Sages said that on Reuben’s standard there was a figure of a man decorated with mandrakes,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">107</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Genesis 30:14.</i> and on Judah’s standard there was the form of a lion, to which Jacob had compared him,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">108</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 49:9.</i> and on Ephraim’s standard was the figure of an ox, based upon [the expression that Moses used in speaking of that tribe], <i>the firstborn of his ox</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">109</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 33:17.</i> and on Dan’s standard was the figure of an eagle.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">110</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This was because of the expression, <i>as an eagle stirreth up his nest</i> (<i>ibid.</i>, 32:11), and of Dan it is written that <i>he was the rearward of all the camps</i> (further, 10:25), who stirred the attention of all the camps to any lurking dangers (Tziyoni).</i> Thus [the four signs on the four main standards] were similar to the four figures that the prophet Ezekiel saw [in the Divine Charriot].”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">111</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel Chapter 1. <i>As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man; and they four had the face of a lion on the right side; and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four had also the face of an eagle</i> (<i>ibid.</i>, Verse 10).</i> The Tent of Meeting was in the exact center, with the camps of the Levites surrounding it in the midst of the camps [of the other tribes], as is mentioned in Sefer Yetzirah:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">112</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I have not found it in our editions of the Sefer Yetzirah (Book of Creation). On the book itself, see Vol. I, p. 24, Note 41.</i> “And the Holy Temple is placed exactly in the middle.”<br>Now the directions [in which the standards were to be set up] begin with the east, like the movement of the sun [in its daily course], and afterwards the south, and then the west and finally the north. They put the [main] standard of Judah in the east because he was the first to start journeying as he was the prince,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">113</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Chronicles 28:4.</i> just as G-d commanded, <i>Judah shall go up</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">114</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Judges 1:2.</i> <i>first</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">115</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 20:18.</i> and Reuben was [set next to him] in the south to honor him as the firstborn. Thus these two neighboring standards consisted of [the children of] Leah [i.e., Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, Reuben Shimon] together with the firstborn of her maidservant who was born upon her [Leah’s] knees [i.e., Gad the son of Zilpah.]. And there was one [main] standard for the children of Rachel [Ephraim, Menasheh, and Benjamin] in the west, and the standard of the [other] children of the maidservants [Dan, Asher, and Naphtali] was last, in the north.<br>I have furthermore seen in the Midrash [the following text]:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">116</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Bamidbar Rabbah 2:9.</i> “And just as the Holy One, blessed be He, created four directions in the universe, so He surrounded His Throne with four ‘living creatures,’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">111</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel Chapter 1. <i>As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man; and they four had the face of a lion on the right side; and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four had also the face of an eagle</i> (<i>ibid.</i>, Verse 10).</i> and high above them all is the Throne of Glory. The Holy One, blessed be He, told Moses to arrange the standards in a manner corresponding to these directions. Thus He said to him: In the east, whence comes light to the world, shall Judah the sovereign pitch his camp, and next to him shall be the tribe of Issachar, who studies the Torah,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">117</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“For it is said, <i>And of the children of Issachar, men that had understanding of the times</i> (I Chronicles 12:32), and Torah is called ‘light,’ <i>For the commandment is a lamp, and the Torah is light</i> (Proverbs 6:23)” (Bamidbar Rabbah 2:9) — Thus, just as the royal House of David is referred to by Scripture in terms of light — as it is said, <i>that David My servant may have ‘a lamp’ always before Me in Jerusalem</i> (I Kings 11:36) — so also is Issachar, student of the Torah which is called light. The position of these two tribes is therefore rightfully in the east whence comes light to the world. And as for Zebulun (see further in text).</i> and next to him the tribe of Zebulun, who is wealthy, just as it is written, <i>Zebulun shall dwell at the shore of the sea</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">118</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 49:13.</i> and it is also said [of Zebulun], <i>for they shall suck the abundance of the sea</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">119</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 33:19. And riches are also referred to as “light” (Midrash Rabbah <i>ibid.</i>). Thus the three tribes that pitched on the east — Judah (sovereignty), Isaachar (knowledge), and Zebulun (wealth) — all represented aspects of “light” which originates in the east.</i> They were to be the first to journey, just as it is said, <i>And their king is passed on before them, and the Eternal at the head of them</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">120</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Micah 2:13.</i> From the south come the dews and the rains [which bring] blessing for the world, therefore shall Reuben pitch on that side, for he is the master of repentance,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">121</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Sotah 7b and Rashi <i>ibid.</i>, that Judah’s repentance in admitting his guilt in the case of Tamar (Genesis 38:26) was motivated by Reuben’s prior repentance in the case of Bilhah (<i>ibid.</i>, 35:22). Reuben was also first of the brothers who tried to save Joseph in order to return him to his father (<i>ibid.</i>, 37:22). According to a Midrash, G-d then said: “‘You [Reuben] were first in making an effort to bring back a beloved son to his father. By your life! A descendant of yours will be the first [of the prophets] to bring back Israel to their Father in heaven.’ And who was that? Hosea the son of Beeri, as it is written, <i>When the Eternal spoke at first with Hosea</i> (Hosea 1:2) [and it was that prophet <i>who proclaimed: Return, O Israel, unto the Eternal thy G-d, for thou hast stumbled in thine iniquity</i>” (<i>ibid.</i> 14: 2)] (Yalkut Shimoni, at the beginning of the Book of Hosea). That Hosea was of the tribe of Reuben is indicated in I Chronicles 5:6, where his father Beerah is counted among the descendants of Reuben. Beeri and Beerah, according to the Rabbis, refer to the same person.</i> which is a good quality, and the mercies of the Holy One, blessed be He, come to the world when people repent [of their evil ways]. Next to Reuben is Gad, who has the quality of heroism.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">122</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 49:19. In our Bamidbar Rabbah: “master of the troop,” as stated in Genesis <i>ibid</i>:</i> Thus there were [in the south] Reuben with repentance, Gad with heroism, and in between them Shimon in order to atone [for his having caused anguish to his father Jacob].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">123</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 5-7, and in Chapter 34:30.</i> <i>And they shall set forth second</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">124</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 16 here.</i> because repentance is second to Torah [for by studying Torah one is coming to repent of evil ways]. In the west are the storehouses of snow, and the storehouses of hail, cold, and heat, and corresponding to them were [the tribes of] Ephraim, Menasheh and Benjamin, and the Divine Presence is always in the west within the border of Benjamin, as it is said, <i>Of Benjamin he</i> [Moses] <i>said: The beloved of the Eternal shall dwell in safety by Him</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">125</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 33:12. This is an allusion to the fact that the Sanctuary proper, in which the Divine Presence resided, was in Benjamin’s territory. The eastern part of the Temple was in the territory of Judah. These three tribes of Ephraim, Menasheh and Benjamin, to whom G-d grants might (see Psalms 80: 3) are thus the most able to resist the destructive aspects of the natural elements (Eitz Yoseph on Bamidbar Rabbah).</i> <i>And they shall set forth third</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">126</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 24 here.</i> for heroism is fitting to Torah and repentance, in order that a person may grow strong in Torah and overcome his [bad] inclinations. From the north comes darkness to the world, and corresponding to it was the tribe of Dan. For what reason? It is because the tribe of Dan darkened the world through the idols which Jeroboam made, as it is said, <i>and the one idol he put in Dan</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">127</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Kings 12:29.</i> Next to him was the tribe of Asher, to illuminate the darkness, as it is said [of Asher], <i>and he shall dip his foot in oil</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">128</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 33:24.</i> and next to him was the tribe of Naphtali who is full of blessings.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">129</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As it is said of that tribe, <i>O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, and full with the blessing of the Eternal</i> (<i>ibid.</i>, Verse 23).</i> <i>They shall set forth hindmost</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">130</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 31 here.</i> for whoever worships idols <i>goes backward and not forward. ”</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">131</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 7:24.</i><br>There [in Bamidbar Rabbah]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">116</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Bamidbar Rabbah 2:9.</i> the Rabbis also interpret [the division of the tribes of Israel according to four standards as] corresponding to the four groups of angels [surrounding the celestial Throne].

Scripture is stating that Eleazar was in charge of all these things, and the meaning of [the end of the verse] is that “he was in <i>charge of all the Tabernacle and</i> in charge of <i>all that therein is</i>.” And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra explained that it means that “Eleazar’s charge extended also to the Tabernacle and to all its vessels, together with his brother Ithamar,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">199</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ibn Ezra’s interpretation is intended to answer the following point: Scripture further on (4:28, 33) explains that it was <i>Ithamar</i> the son of Aaron who was in charge of the work of the sons of Gershon [in carrying the curtains, etc.] and of the work of the sons of Merari [in carrying the boards and bars of the Tabernacle, etc.]. Why then does Scripture state here that the charge of <i>Eleazar</i> was <i>all the Tabernacle</i> etc.? Ibn Ezra answers that Eleazar shared together with his brother Ithamar in the charge of <i>all the Tabernacle</i> etc., and that the first part of our verse is pointing out that in addition to sharing the general charge of the Tabernacle, Eleazar was, due to his great distinction, solely in charge of <i>the oil for the light</i> etc. Ramban objects to this interpretation and suggests his own explanation.</i> and that due to Eleazar’s great distinction, he alone was in charge of the oil [for the light], and the incense.” But this is not correct, since Scripture states [that the services of the sons of Gershon and Merari were] <i>under the hand of Ithamar</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">200</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 4:28, 33.</i> [which thus indicates that Eleazar had no share in it]!

It is clear from Scripture’s explanations that Eleazar was <i>the prince of the princes of the Levites</i> inasmuch as he supervised the most holy things. In Verse 4 above it is clearly stated that the sons of Kohath — <i>alone</i> — were in charge of the most holy things, thus disproving Ibn Ezra’s explanation quoted above. If so, the phrase <i>the charge of all the Tabernacle</i> must be in apposition to the end of the verse namely <i>in the Sanctuary, and in the vessels thereof</i>, and the meaning is as follows: “the charge of the oil for the light, etc., <i>the charge of all the Tabernacle</i>, that is, <i>in the Sanctuary, and in the vessels thereof which</i> refers to the most holy things [the ark, etc.] they were given over to the Kohathites — and all these were under the charge of Eleazar,” just as Ithamar was in charge of the work of the sons of Gershon and Merari.

Now since Scripture does not say that Eleazar “shall bear” [the oil for the light etc.] as is said of the Levites,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">205</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 25: <i>And they shall bear …</i></i> it would appear that Eleazar did not carry them, but was in charge over them and would give them from hand to hand to those Kohathites whom he chose because of their zeal and piety.

This rule applies to the compounding of the incense, which was to be done once every year. But, continues Ramban, although valid if done in this manner, surely Moses would prepare the complete, and not just half, the required amount. Hence Eleazar carried the full quantity [except, of course, for the amount that had been used up from the time of the erection of the Tabernacle until the camps set forth].</i> and the oil for the light for a whole year was a large amount, namely one hundred and eighty-three logs,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">212</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Half a log of oil was used up every night of the year (Menachoth 89 a). This was the measure that was estimated to be sufficient for the longest night of the year ; if any of the oil was left over on the shorter nights, it did not matter (<i>ibid</i>).</i> and as for [the ingredients required for] the continual meal-offering, we do not know how many days’ supply he carried!

                    "AND THE PILLARS OF THE COURT ROUND ABOUT, AND THEIR SOCKETS, AND THEIR PINS, AND THEIR CORDS. “[These sockets, pins and cords refer only to] those of the pillars, because the pins and cords of the hangings were part of the burden of the Gershonites [as stated above in Verse 26, and here Scripture is speaking of the work of the sons of Merari]. For there were pins and cords for the curtains and hangings on their lower edges, so that the wind should not raise them, and there were [also] pins and cords round about the pillars, in order to suspend the hangings on them at their upper edges with poles and rails, as we have been taught in [the Beraitha] on the work of the Tabernacle.” This is Rashi’s language. But I do not understand what pins have to do with the pillars!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The pins were made of brass (Exodus 27:19) and their purpose was to secure the hangings to the ground so that the wind would not blow them from side to side. The poles and rods to which the <i>upper end</i> of the hangings was fixed, however, were made of wood, not of brass, and are not included in the Hebrew word for pins. Therefore Ramban asks what do the pins [made of brass] have to do with the pillars? (Kur Zahav).</i> Moreover, [even if the pillars did have pins], why were the pins of the pillars different from the other pins, in that [the other pins were given] to the sons of Gershon, and those [of the pillars were given] to the sons of Merari? Nor have I found in the Mishnah<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See further in the following text, and also in Ramban on Exodus 26: 17, from which it is clear that Ramban when referring to the “Mishnah”, is in fact referring to the Beraitha on the construction of the Tabernacle. For the nature of this book, see Vol. II, p. 448, Note 108.</i> on the work of the Tabernacle that there were pins to the pillars! Instead, the Rabbis taught there the following:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">M’lecheth Hamishkan, Chapter 5 (p. 33, in Ish Shalom’s edition).</i> “He [Moses] joined the rails by means of cords to the pillars, and attached them to the pins of the Tent. And just as there were pins to the Tabernacle, so were there pins to the court, as it is said, <i>All the instruments of the Tabernacle in all the service thereof, and all the pins thereof, and all the pins of the court</i>, round about, <i>shall be of brass</i>. ”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 27:19. The expression “round about” is found <i>ibid.</i>, 38:20.</i> This is the language of the Beraitha. And it does not teach there that there were pins to the pillars.<br>But we must rather explain that the pins and cords of <i>the hangings of the court</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 26.</i> were in the hands of the sons of Merari [not, as Rashi understands, that they were in the charge of the Gershonites]; whereas it is the cords and pins of the Tabernacle and Tent<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Note 179 in <i>Seder Bamidbar</i>.</i> that were in the hands of the Gershonites, for [the prepositions] <i>and ‘their’ cords, and all the instruments of ‘their’ service</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 26.</i> [mentioned in connection with the charge of the Gershonites] are a reference to <i>the curtains of the Tabernacle and the Tent of Meeting</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 25.</i> mentioned in [the beginning of] the previous verse [relating to the work to be done by the Gershonite], and do not refer to [the hangings of] the court [as Rashi wrote]. Similarly, when He said above [with reference to the charge of the Gershonites], <i>and the cords ‘of it’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 3:26.</i> [the preposition “it”] alludes to the Tabernacle mentioned there [in the <i>preceding</i> verse],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 25: <i>And the charge of the sons of Gershon in the Tent of Meeting, the Tabernacle and the Tent</i> etc. — Ramban is thus, interpreting the preposition “it” [<i>and the cords of ‘it’</i>] — in 3:26 — as referring back to Verse 25 which mentions the Tabernacle and Tent and does not refer to <i>the hangings of the court</i> mentioned in the selfsame Verse 26. To prove this method of exegesis, Ramban proceeds to bring examples from other places in Scripture where this principle perforce applies.</i> and not to the hangings of the court [mentioned in the same verse]. A similar case [of a Scriptural reference to a prior subject] is [G-d’s command addressed to Aaron]: <i>only ‘they’ shall not come nigh unto the vessels of holiness and unto the altar</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 18:3.</i> [where the pronoun “they”] refers back to the more distant [phrase, namely: <i>thy brethren, the tribe of Levi</i>] <i>the tribe of thy father</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 2.</i> [mentioned] in the preceding verse, and does not refer to the nearer [phrase] <i>thy sons</i>. So also the verse, <i>And ‘their’ redemption-money — from a month old shalt thou redeem them</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 16.</i> [where the word “their”] refers back to <i>the firstborn of man</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 15.</i> [mentioned in the earlier part of the preceding verse], and not to <i>the firstling of unclean beasts</i> [stated at the end of the preceding verse]. There are many cases like this.<br>However, it appears to me that according to the text of the Beraitha [mentioned further on] the Gershonites only carried cloths, but [did] not [carry] any brass and wood at all. This is the Beraitha wherein we are taught:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">M’lecheth Hamishkan, Chapter 13 (p. 80, in Ish Shalom’s edition).</i> “The sons of Gershon were assigned [to pitch] on the west<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 3:23.</i> [of the Tabernacle], and they were in charge of all woven materials.” If so, the meaning of the term <i>and their pins</i> [mentioned in the verse before us dealing with the charge of the sons of Merari] is: “[the pins] of the Tabernacle <i>and</i> of the pillars of the court,” while [the term] <i>and their cords</i> refers only to those of the pillars of the <i>court</i> [since the cords of the Tabernacle itself were in the hands of the Gershonites]. Similarly He said above [with reference to the burden of the sons of Merari]<i>: the boards of the Tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and the sockets thereof, and all the instruments thereof, and all that pertaineth to the service thereof</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 36.</i> including [in general terms] the pins thereof [i.e., of both the Tabernacle and the pillars of the court]. Therefore He mentioned the cords [in speaking of] both [the burdens of the sons of Gershon<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 26.</i> and those of Merari,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In this verse.</i> because the cords of the Tabernacle were carried by the sons of Gershon, and those of the pillars of the court by the sons of Merari], but the pins He mentioned only [in the verse before us] with reference to the sons of Merari [because the Gershonites carried no objects of brass or wood at all, but which instead were carried by the sons of Merari].",
                    "AND BY NAME YE SHALL APPOINT THE INSTRUMENTS OF THE CHARGE OF THEIR BURDENS.

                    "UPHKUDAV’ (THUS WERE THEY NUMBERED OF HIM) ‘ASHER’ THE ETERNAL COMMANDED MOSES. “A <i>Masorah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Masorah</i> is the tradition handed down from generation to generation of the exact Scriptural text, and also refers to a collection of exegetical notes on the Scriptural text. The comment before us is of this second class.</i> has it: Five [words in the Scriptures] are written <i>asher</i> (‘which,’ or ‘that’) but they are to be understood as <i>ka’asher</i> (‘as’),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This whole sentence is not found in our texts of Rashi. See however, Berliner’s edition of Rashi, p. 286. — The point though is clear. The Hebrew text reads: <i>asher tziva Hashem</i> literally meaning: [and his countings] “which the Eternal commanded,” and Rashi on the basis of a <i>Masorah</i> interpreted it to mean: <i>ka’asher tziva Hashem</i> — [thus were they numbered] “‘as’ the Eternal commanded.” Ramban later on interprets the text <i>asher tziva Hashem</i> in its literal meaning.</i> [this being one of the five cases, and therefore the above expression is to be interpreted as follows: <i>thus were they numbered of him ‘as’ the Eternal commanded Moses</i>]. And those counted were, in accordance with the command, from thirty to fifty years old.” This is Rashi’s language. If this is so, the word, <i>uphkudav</i> refers to Moses [<i>thus were they numbered ‘of him’</i> — by Moses]. But Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented that [the meaning of the verse is as follows]: <i>every one</i>, that is to say, of the three [Levitical] families — namely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari — Moses appointed <i>to his service, and to his burden</i> as Scripture mentioned above [that he should appoint them]. And this is the meaning of [the word] <i>uphkudav</i>, namely “[the appointment] of every one” mentioned.<br>But it is possible that the expression <i>‘asher’ tziva</i> be understood in its plain sense [i.e., “which” He commanded, and not, as Rashi has it, as if it said <i>‘ka’asher’ tziva</i> — “as” He commanded]. Scripture would thus be saying that Moses appointed [each of the sons of] these three brothers [i.e., Gershon, Kohath, and Merari] <i>to his service and to his burden</i> as explained above; <i>‘uphkudav’</i> (<i>and the numbered individuals</i>) of each of them <i>‘which’ the Eternal commanded Moses</i> to count <i>by their polls</i>, he appointed <i>to his service, and to his burden</i>. Thus the verse mentioned that Moses numbered them by their families, and also that he appointed the [numbered] individuals by their polls, <i>every one to his service, and to his burden</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In brief: a) according to Rashi <i>asher tziva</i> is to be understood as <i>ka’asher tziva</i> (“as” the Eternal commanded). b) Rashi explains <i>uphkudav</i> as meaning “his countings,” i.e., those of Moses. Ibn Ezra interprets it as “his appointments,” the pronoun “his” referring to each of the three Levitical families. c) Ramban explains <i>asher tziva</i> in its literal sense, “which” the Eternal commanded [as explained in the text], the word <i>uphkudav</i> he understands as does Rashi, i.e., as “countings,” but the pronoun [“his”] Ramban explains as referring to each of the three brothers [Gershon, Kohath, and Merari — not personally, but in the sense of the descendants of each of them] <i>‘which G-d commanded’</i> Moses to count <i>by their polls</i> — each of them he assigned to his individual work.</i> And such indeed is the law, that a Levite [of one group] is not permitted to do the work of another group or to assist therein, just as the Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Arakhin 11b.</i> “It once happened that Rabbi Yehoshua the son of Chananyah wanted to help [his fellow-Levite] Rabbi Yochanan the son of Gudgada to close the gates [of the Sanctuary]; whereupon [the latter] said to him: ‘Turn back, [for if you do not do so] your life is already forfeit, since I am one of the gatekeepers, and you are one of the singers.’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">All the Levites were divided into two groups, those who attended only to the gates in the Sanctuary, and those who attended to the singing at the Services. It was forbidden for a Levite of one group to do the work generally assigned to one of the other group (see “The Commandments,” Vol. II, pp. 70-72).</i>"

This is the plain meaning of the verse. And so the Rabbis have said in the Sifre:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifre <i>Naso</i> 5.

The “Sifre” is the Tannaitic Midrash on the Books of Numbers and Deuteronomy. It is equivalent to the Mechilta on Exodus, and the Sifra or Torath Kohanim on Leviticus.</i> “<i>Which ‘yakrivu’</i> (<i>they bring</i>) <i>unto the priest</i>. Said Rabbi Yishmael: But do they bring the heave-offering to the priest? What then is the meaning of the expression, <i>which ‘yakrivu’</i> (<i>they bring</i>) <i>unto the priest, shall be his?</i> [It is as follows:] Since He stated, <i>The choicest first-fruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the House of the Eternal thy G-d</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 23:19.</i> but we have not been informed yet what shall be done with them, therefore Scripture states [here], <i>which ‘yakrivu’</i> (<i>they bring</i>) <i>unto the priest, shall be his</i> — Scripture comes and teaches you that the first-fruits are to be given to the priest.” Now Rashi [in citing here this text of the Sifre] explained [the question] “But do they bring the heave-offering to the priest?” in the following way: “Does not the priest have to go around the granaries asking for it?” But this is not clear.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">From Rashi’s comment it is obvious that even if the priest does not take it by force, but goes around the granaries to obtain the heave-offering, it is also prohibited on the basis of the expression stating <i>which ‘yakrivu’</i> (<i>they ‘bring’</i>) <i>unto the priest, shall be his</i>. The heave-offering, according to Rashi, is to be “brought” to the priest. In the opinion of Ramban, only the priest’s taking it by force is forbidden, while his going around for it, is not prohibited in this verse, [[illegible]]since the <i>yakrivu</i> as explained by Rabbi Yishmael in the Sifre is to be understood as denoting offering on the altar, and his question is as follows: “Were they [really] (<i>yakrivu</i>) ‘bringing’ the heave-offering on the altar? Certainly not. Therefore it must refer to the first-fruits.” In brief, Rashi’s interpretation of <i>yakrivu</i> as “bringing” the heave-offering to the priest is therefore “not clear” (as Ramban expresses it).</i> But the [correct] explanation is that in the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael [in the above text of the Sifre] the root <i>hakravah</i> in the Torah [“bringing” — as in <i>yakrivu</i> mentioned here] refers only to things which are offered up on the altar. Therefore he interpreted the expression <i>‘asher yakrivu’</i> (<i>which they bring</i>) as referring to the first-fruits, which require waving and bringing to the altar, Scripture thus stating [here] that all first-fruits which the owners bring to G-d shall belong to the officiating priest. And when Rabbi Yishmael said [in the Sifre above], “Since it is stated, <i>The choicest first-fruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the House of the Eternal thy G-d</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 23:19.</i> but I do not know what is to be done with them,” he means to say that we have not yet been taught at all that the first-fruits are amongst the gifts of the priests, and it is here that He taught us for the first time that they are to be given to the priest. But afterwards He taught it again in the section dealing with [the gifts of] the priests: <i>The first ripe fruits of all that is in their Land, which they bring unto the Eternal, shall be thine</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 18:13.</i> for there He also restated the [laws of the] heave-offering,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 12.</i> and hallowed objects,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 9, 17-19.</i> in order to include together all gifts given to the priests, and to make <i>a covenant of salt</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 19.</i> for all of them [indicating that just as salt never decays, so will His covenant with Aaron endure].

The verse is speaking about first-fruits.</i> We furthermore learn from the verse here [i.e., from the expression <i>asher yakrivu</i> which, as explained above, refers to some act of service in the Sanctuary] that the first-fruits are to be given to the men of the <i>mishmar</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">64</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Note 92 in <i>Seder Bamidbar</i>.</i> to offer it up [i.e., to the priests who are then on duty in the Sanctuary], and that [the owner] may not give them to any priest he wants to, as is the law of the heave-offering."

                    "AND EVERY MAN’S HALLOWED THINGS SHALL BE HIS; WHATSOEVER ANY MAN GIVETH THE PRIEST, IT SHALL BE HIS. The correct interpretation of this verse is that Scripture is saying that <i>all</i> hallowed things of a man shall be his, meaning to say that all hallowed things about which He has not commanded that they be given to the priest, [such as the Second Tithe, fourth-year produce of trees and the tithe of the cattle] shall be the owners’ [entirely], and they may have benefit from [and eat] them, even though they are called “holy.” But <i>whatsoever any man giveth the priest</i> as I have commanded him, <i>it shall be his</i> [partially], for even in the hallowed things about which Scripture commanded that they be given to the priest, the owners have a certain right, for although they belong to the priest to whom the owner gives them, as his personal property [but the owners have the right in these hallowed things to choose to whom to give them]. Thus the Second Tithe and the fourth-year produce of trees about which Scripture stated that they be <i>holy to the Eternal</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 27:30 (speaking of the Second Tithe): 19:24 (in reference to fourth-year produce of trees). Both of these “holy” things do not have to be given to the priest, but are to be eaten by the owner in Jerusalem.</i> belong to the owner as his personal property, and likewise the tithe of cattle.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 27:32. The tithe of cattle likewise did not have to be given to the priest, but belonged wholly to the owner, after the blood and fat of the animal were offered upon the altar (see “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 90-91).</i> But as for all other hallowed things concerning which He commanded in the section of <i>Vayikach Korach</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">67</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 16:1. The reference here is to the section on the gifts given to the priests (<i>ibid.</i>, 18:8-32).</i> that they should give them to the priest, they are to be given to him directly by the owners, and the priests cannot take them from them by force. From this we may deduce ourselves that the right of choosing to whom to give them [with the consequent satisfaction of so doing] is that of the owners. This is the correct interpretation in accordance with the plain meaning of the verse. It is also the opinion of Onkelos [who rendered the verse: “and every man’s hallowed ‘tithe’ shall be his,” thus in dicating that he understood the verse as referring to a tithe which is the owner’s, for instance the Second Tithe].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Onkelos’ expression “hallowed tithe” may also refer to the First Tithe [given to the Levites] or the Poorman’s Tithe (see my Hebrew commentary, p. 212), in which case Ramban understands that Onkelos supports the explanation he mentioned: namely, that these tithes, although given away by the owner, are still partially “his” inasmuch as the choice to whom to give them and satisfaction of so chosing, is his.</i> It is interpreted in a similar manner in the Sifre, where the Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifre <i>Naso</i> 6.</i> “All hallowed things are included in the general verse stating, <i>And every man’s hallowed things shall be his</i>. Scripture took away all hallowed things and gave them to the priests, leaving only the thanks-offering, the peace-offering, and the Passover-offering, because they too belong to the owners” [and they are permitted to eat them]. However, this verse is not necessary at all for these matters [i.e., to teach us that the thanks-offering, peace-offering, and Passover-offering belong to their owners, since in each of these cases Scripture clearly states that the meat is eaten by the owners, hence the verse before us must refer, as indicated above, to the Second Tithe, and fourth-year produce of trees].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Sifre, however, mentioned “the thanks-offering etc.” incidentally because it discusses all the hallowed things which belong to the owners.</i>"

But in my opinion the expression <i>for it is a meal-offering of jealousies</i> refers to the beginning of the verse, stating that the husband shall bring the offering for his wife, that is to say, instead of her, <i>for it is a meal-offering of jealousies</i> bringing her iniquity to remembrance. Thus it is not fitting that she should bring it of her own property, but it is he who is to bring the meal-offering to G-d so that He should take note of his suspicions of her, and punish her on his [the husband’s] behalf. And the reason [why this meal-offering comes from] <i>se’orim</i> (barley)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">74</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word <i>se’orim</i> (barley) is suggestive of the word <i>sa’ar</i> (storm), as is indicated in the next verse quoted by Ramban.</i> is so that <i>‘sa’arath’</i> (<i>a storm of</i>) <i>the Eternal is gone forth in fury, yea, a whirling storm; it shall whirl upon the head of wickedness</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">75</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 23:19.</i> like <i>the cake of barley bread</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">76</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Judges 7:13. Gideon indeed inflicted later a great defeat upon the Midianite host (<i>ibid.</i>, 22-28).</i> mentioned in the story of Gideon, which [one of the Midianites who saw it in a dream] interpreted as referring to a storm (<i>sa’ar</i>) and great confusion [which would break forth upon the camp of the Midianites]. Similarly, <i>the earthen vessel</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">77</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 17.</i> [in which the holy water is put] is a hint that she shall be broken like a potter’s vessel,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">78</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Jeremiah 19:11.</i> and likewise the dust [which must be taken from the floor of the Tabernacle and put into the water<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">77</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 17.</i> indicates] that she is dust, and into dust shall she return<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">79</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Genesis 3:19.</i> [if she is guilty of adultery]. The meaning of the word <i>hu</i> [<i>ki minchath kna’oth ‘hu’</i> — using the masculine form of “it” in the phrase “it is a meal-offering of jealousies,” when it should have used <i>hi</i>, the feminine form, since the word <i>minchah</i> (meal-offering) is feminine] is because it refers back to the word <i>kemach</i> (flour) [which is mentioned above in the same verse, and the word <i>kemach</i> is masculine]. But this [unusual usage of the masculine here] has a mystical explanation, for further on when the meal-offering is in the hands of the woman<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">80</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 18.</i> Scripture uses the word <i>hi</i> [<i>minchath kna’oth hi</i> — literally: “‘she’ is a meal-offering of jealousies”]. And now fin this verse] Scripture mentions the memorial first, stating that “she” <i>brings iniquity to remembrance</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">81</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse here reads: <i>ki minchath kna’oth hu minchath zikaron mazkereth avon</i> [literally: “for a meal-offering of jealousies ‘he’ is, a meal-offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance”], and the meaning thereof is that in this meal-offering there is both judgment and mercy: judgment, if she is guilty, and mercy if innocent. The word <i>hu</i> in this verse thus refers both to <i>kemach</i> and <i>zikaron</i>, which allude to these two attributes. Hence also the word <i>hu</i> is mentioned before <i>zikaron</i> (“memorial”), for “the memorial which brings iniquity to remembrance” surely alludes to the attribute of judgment, and the word <i>hu</i> which is mentioned <i>before</i> “the memorial” therefore alludes to mercy. Further on in Verse 18, however, the text reads: <i>eith minchath hazikaron minchath kna’oth hi</i>. There the word <i>hi</i> (“she”) appears at the <i>end</i> of the whole expression, after <i>hazikaron</i> (“the memorial”), when the meal-offering is in her hands [as the verse states] it is only “judgment” which brings the iniquity to remembrance.

The commentators<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">82</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi and Ibn Ezra.</i> have written that Scripture describes it [i.e., <i>the water of bitterness</i>] in terms of its final effect, for there will be a bitterness in it, and <i>G-d</i> will <i>deal very bitterly with her</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">83</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ruth 1:20.</i> and it will effect a curse upon her.

If so, the verse stating, <i>and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her and become bitter</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">87</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 24.</i> should rather have said: “and the bitter water shall enter into her to cause the curse,” [since the bitter substance was already present in the water before she drank it].

Therefore Scripture states, <i>And when he hath made her drink the water, then it shall come to pass, if she be defiled, and have acted unfaithfully against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her and become bitter</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">90</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 27. This shows that the water is called <i>mei hamarim</i> in our verse because of its final effect, for if she is guilty, the curses that have been erased into the water will cause a bitter taste and the fatal effects described further on.</i> for it is after drinking, when the water enters her belly, that it immediately becomes bitter in her mouth and inside her, as happens with all substances which make one nauseous and cause vomiting, that they seem very bitter to those that drink them. After that <i>her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall fall away</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">90</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 27. This shows that the water is called <i>mei hamarim</i> in our verse because of its final effect, for if she is guilty, the curses that have been erased into the water will cause a bitter taste and the fatal effects described further on.</i> The water is called [in the verse before us] <i>m’orerim</i> [from the root <i>arur</i> — “cursed”] because of the curses [written on the scroll] which have been erased into the water, and which cause her to suffer their effects.<br>Now the commentators<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">91</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The commentators quoted above. The point involved is as follows: Since the commentators explain that <i>mei hamarim</i> is a reference to the final effect of the water, the word <i>mei</i> cannot be in construct [‘the water of’ bitterness — for it is not yet bitter]; thus the word <i>mei</i> here merely means “water” — “the bitter water,” and is so called because of its final effect. However, as Ramban continues, according to the Rabbis who said that the bitter substance was mixed with the water, the word <i>mei</i> may indeed be understood as being in construct — “the water ‘of’ bitterness,” since the water was already bitter.</i> have said that the word <i>mei</i> [<i>‘mei’ hamarim</i>] is like <i>mayim hamarim</i> [“the bitter water”], the word <i>mei</i> [literally: “the water of”] being stated here in a construct form in place of the absolute form, just as we find [an opposite verse]: <i>mayim birkayim</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">92</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 47:3.</i> [literally: “the water the ankles,” where the word <i>mayim</i> occurs in the absolute form, but is really to be understood in the construct: <i>mei birkayim</i> — “the water ‘of’ the ankles,” i.e., water which reached as high as the ankles]. But Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote that “the word <i>mei</i> is [indeed] construct [meaning: <i>the water ‘of’</i>], but the word <i>hamarim</i> is an adjectival noun [meaning: ‘the bitter substances’ — thus <i>mei hamarim</i> means ‘the water of bitter substances’], and if so, the secret thereof is known.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">93</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A reference by Ibn Ezra to the statement of the Sages that a bitter substance had to be mixed with the water, and hence the term <i>mei hamarim</i> — “the water of bitter substances.”</i> But [Ibn Ezra’s interpretation] does not appear to me to be correct, because the verse states, <i>and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her and become bitter</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">89</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 23.</i>"

The correct meaning of the verse is as if it had said: “<i>This is the law of the Nazirite who voweth</i> a vow of the Nazirite;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">109</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse cannot be understood literally, for “the law of the Nazirite” does not consist of a vow to bring a sin-offering; rather, “the law of the Nazirite” is that he must not eat grapes or drink wine, nor defile himself by contact with the dead, and the offering is brought on fulfillment of the Nazirite vow. Hence Ramban explains that the meaning of the verse is: “this is the law of the Nazirite who vows a vow of Naziritehood, etc.”</i> <i>his offering unto the Eternal for his Naziritehood</i> shall be <i>besides that which his means suffice</i>.” Or it may mean: “<i>This is the law of the Nazirite</i>, and this is the law of <i>his offering unto the Eternal for his Naziritehood</i>.” It is possible that He is saying: “<i>This is the law of the Nazirite</i>, that <i>he vow his offering unto the Eternal for his Naziritehood</i>,” meaning to say that he should not specify a particular animal as an offering, but should vow: “I shall bring an offering for my Naziritehood,” or he should simply say: “I am a Nazirite,” for as soon as he vowed to be a Nazirite, it is [already] binding upon him as a vow [to bring] the offering mentioned [in the Torah]. He reverts and states, <i>besides that which his means suffice</i>, [meaning to say] that if he is rich he may [voluntarily] increase his offerings [i.e., the burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, as will be explained, but not the sin-offering]; and <i>according to his vow which he voweth</i> concerning these offerings, whether [he is] rich or poor, <i>so he must do after the law of his Naziriteship</i> — so that he may bring more, but not less [than what Scripture prescribes for him to bring]. He mentioned this in order to teach us that if the Nazirite was rich and wants to bring several offerings, or if he vowed at the beginning: “I am a Nazirite and I shall bring a thousand burnt-offerings and peace-offerings,” then he must bring them all on the day of completion [of his time as a Nazirite], and he may not drink wine until he has offered them all up, for they all constitute <i>the law of his Naziriteship</i>. It is possible that [the latter half of the verse means]: “<i>besides that for which his means suffice</i> so must he do <i>according to his vow which he voweth</i>.” This He mentioned because it is usually the rich who vow in this way.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">110</sup><i class=\"footnote\">At first Ramban explained the expression <i>besides that which his means suffice</i> as referring to the rich, and <i>according to his vow which he voweth</i> as applying to the poor, as explained above. Now Ramban interprets both expressions as applying to the rich, for it is usually they who vow to bring several burnt-offerings or peace-offerings. The reason why Ramban gives this interpretation may be because it is unnecessary for Scripture to state specifically that a poor Nazirite must bring the minimum number of offerings, as was explained in the first interpretation, since this is self-understood.</i>"

This teaches us that on each of the seven days of initiation [of the priests] Moses erected and dismantled the Tabernacle, and on that day [the eighth day] he erected it but did not dismantle it. Therefore it says, <i>on the day that Moses had finished setting up the Tabernacle</i>, since it was on that day that he finished all his erections.

But it is not a complete proof [that Moses set up the Tabernacle and dismantled it again on each of the seven days of initiation], for the expression <i>on the day that he had finished</i> is not connected only with the word <i>l’hakim</i> (setting up), but [its meaning is rather as follows]: “<i>on the day that Moses had finished setting up the Tabernacle</i> and anointing and sanctifying it, and [doing likewise to] the altar and all the vessels thereof — the princes offered their offerings, when all this was done.” Nonetheless [however we explain the verse], it was [indeed] on the eighth day [of the initiation of the priests].<br>This section was written here because on the first day of the initiation <i>He called unto Moses out of the Tent of Meeting and G-d spoke to him</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">128</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 1:1.</i> all the sections [of the Torah] from the beginning of the Book of Leviticus until the section of <i>Vayehi Bayom Ha’shemini</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">111</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 9:1.

Now the princes thought that it would be impossible for the Levites to carry on their shoulders the boards of the Tabernacle and the sockets, which were very heavy, and therefore they brought the wagons of their own accord, for such is the way that all those who carry houses of kings and their palatial tents adopt, transporting them on wagons.<br>We may also explain that the expression <i>And they brought their offering before the Eternal, six wagons ‘tzov,’</i> means six large wagons bearing their offerings, <i>and twelve oxen</i> drawing the wagons. Thus they brought the wagons laden [with the offerings], and the oxen [drawing the wagons] <i>before the Tabernacle</i>.

Hence the second interpretation is to be preferred.</i> And it is a linguistic expression [in the Sacred Language] to say “wagons” when referring to their contents, just like: <i>those who eat ‘shulchan Izebel’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">140</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Kings 18:19.</i> [literally: “Jezebel’s table,” which means “the food on Jezebel’s table”].

Rabbi Moshe the Preacher is however quoted here in Verse 23. He was an older contemporary of Rashi’s who lived in the city of Narbonne. His work was in the nature of a Midrashic commentary compiled from earlier sources. See in Vol. I, p. 424 Note 196.</i> But I cannot understand what they mean in saying this. If we are to consider this a miracle, what benefit is there in the occurrence of this miracle? And if this is the natural result with all weights, why should Scripture specifically mention it?

Here, however, the term <i>beith olamim</i> refers both to the Tabernacle and to the Sanctuary.</i> were not like ordinary vessels. In the case of ordinary vessels, if one weighs each separately and then weighs them all together, the total is sometimes more or less [than it should have been] etc.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">149</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Now this Sifre “clearly” states [as Ramban wrote above] that there was some special phenomenon in the weighing of the vessels. It does not yet explain what purpose it served; hence Ramban continues to quote from the Sifre the words of Rabbi Nathan.</i> And there [in the Sifre] the Rabbis further said: “Rabbi Nathan says: If one were to weigh all the vessels of the Sanctuary together<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">148</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “the Permanent House” (see Vol. II, p. 335, Note 598). Here, however, the term <i>beith olamim</i> refers both to the Tabernacle and to the Sanctuary.</i> and then turn them into bullion, and again make vessels of it, they would be neither more nor less [than the original weight].” He means to say by this that [these vessels were made of] a very pure gold [or silver, as the case may be], so that even if one melted them down and turned them into bullion, they still remained at their original weight. This was not because a miracle happened to them, but because they were made of a very pure gold.<br>The correct interpretation of the verse is that the Holy One, blessed be He, bestows honor upon those who fear Him, just as He said, <i>for them that honor Me I will honor</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">150</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 2:30.</i> Now all the princes brought this offering on the same day, because they all agreed to it simultaneously. But since it was impossible that one of them should not precede the others, He honored those who came first in [the position of] the standards to bring their offerings on the earlier days. He wanted, however, to mention them all by name and the details of their offerings, and to cite the day of each one, rather than honoring the first one by saying, <i>This was the offering of Nachshon the son of Amminadab</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">151</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 17.</i> and then saying “and so did each of the princes offer on his day,” for that would have been a diminution of the honor of the others. Afterwards [i.e., after having listed them all separately] He included them all again in a general verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">144</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 84.</i> in order to tell us that they were all equal before Him, blessed be He. And so did the Rabbis say in the Sifre:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">152</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifre <i>Naso</i> 53.</i> “Scripture tells us that just as they were all equal in the thought [of bringing these offerings] so were they all alike in merit. <i>Twelve silver dishes</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">144</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 84.</i> — these were the same ones that they donated, and nothing which would have invalidated them<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">153</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Such as becoming chipped or perforated, in which case a sacred vessel may no longer be used.

Therefore they brought a meal-offering, incense, a burnt-offering, a sin-offering, and a peace-offering. Now the incense and the sin-offering were [permitted to be brought by] a special temporary decree, since they cannot usually be brought as freewill offerings. But [this exception was made] in order to complete the dedication with all kinds of offerings, for no other offerings can be brought in Israel except for these offerings [mentioned here], the sin-offering and the guilt-offering being the same thing and having the same name, and <i>there is one law for them</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">185</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 7:7: <i>As is the sin-offering, so is the guilt-offering; there is one law for them</i>.

Thy contribution is [of] greater [significance] than theirs, for thou wilt kindle and trim the lamps every morning and evening.’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Every morning and evening.” This is not found in our texts of Rashi.</i> This is Rashi’s language, from a Midrash Agadah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tanchuma <i>Beha’alothcha</i> 5. — “Midrash Agadah.” Rabbinic texts on the Five Books of Moses are divided into two classes: “Midrash Halachah” (texts dealing mainly with the legal parts of the Torah), which consist of the Mechilta on the Book of Exodus, Sifra [or Torath Kohanim] on the Book of Leviticus, and Sifre on the Books of Numbers and Deuteronomy. Another set of texts deal mainly with the narrative, ethical and homiletical aspects of the Scriptures. These comprise two major works — the Midrash Rabbah and Tanchuma. There is in addition a large group of smaller Midrashim that belong to this category. The generic term “Midrash Agadah” includes all this second group of texts.</i><br>But it is not clear to me why G-d consoled Aaron [by reminding him of his function] in lighting the lamps, rather than consoling him with the burning of the incense every morning and evening, which is [the specific function of his] with which Scripture praised him, as it is said, <i>they shall put incense before Thee</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 33:10. This was recited by Moses in praise of the whole tribe of Levi consisting of priests and Levites, and he singled out this function of the priests for special praise, thus indicating that the burning of incense was a highly significant act.

Moreover, what reason was there for Aaron’s uneasiness of mind [upon seeing the offerings of the princes]? Was not his [dedication-] offering greater than that of the [other] princes, for he offered up during those days — all the [seven] days of the initiation [of the priests] — many offerings? And if you reply that [he was disheartened because] his offerings were obligatory and he had been commanded to bring them, and therefore he was dispirited because he did not bring a <i>voluntary</i> offering for the dedication of the altar as they did — [this cannot be so] because the lighting of the lamps with which He consoled Aaron was also a duty which he had been commanded! [Therefore what consolation did Aaron derive for not sharing in the <i>voluntary</i> offerings by being given a commandment which was obligatory?]<br>But the intention of this homiletic text is to derive an allusion from this section [of the Torah] to the Chanukah (“Dedication”) of lights which occurred in the period of the Second Temple through Aaron and his sons, namely [Matithyahu] the Hasmonean, who was High Priest, and his sons.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Vol. I, pp. 589-590.</i> And I have found this explanation in the following text of Megillath Setharim<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “Scroll of Hidden Things.” This was a kind of anthology of various subjects — law, tradition, Biblical exegesis, philosophy, as well as explanations of customs.

After the death of his father, Rabbeinu Nissim together with Rabbeinu Chananel (see Vol. II p. 106, Note 45, and Vol. III, p. 324, Note 286) were the recognized authorities of the Kairwan community. Rabbeinu Nissim wrote a commentary on many tractates of the Talmud which is existing and is outstanding for its clarity of exposition.</i> who mentions this tradition, saying: “I have seen in the Midrash: When [the princes of] the twelve tribes brought the dedication-offerings and the tribe of Levi did not etc., the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, <i>Speak unto Aaron, and say unto him: When thou lightest the lamps</i>. There is another Dedication in which there will be lighting of the lamps, when I will perform through your sons miracles and salvation for Israel, and a Dedication which will be called by their name, namely, ‘the Chanukah of the sons of the Hasmonean.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The sense of the verse here is thus: “It is you [Aaron and sons, through your descendants the Hasmoneans] who will kindle and trim the lamps in the days of the Second Temple.”</i> Therefore He put this section [dealing with the lighting of the lamps] next to the section concerning the dedication of the altar.” Thus far is his [Rabbeinu Nissim’s] language.<br>And I have further seen in Yelamdeinu<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tanchuma <i>Beha’alothcha</i>, 5.

You are designated for something of greater importance than this. The offerings are brought only as long as the Sancutary is in existence, but the lamps will <i>give light in front of the candelabrum</i> forever; and all the blessings that I have given you with which to bless My children will never come to an end.’” Now it is an obvious fact that when the Sanctuary is not in existence and the offerings are not brought because of its destruction, the lighting of the lamps [of the candelabrum in the Sanctuary] also ceases [so what does the Midrash mean in saying that G-d promised Aaron that the lighting of the lamps would never stop]! Therefore [we must say] that the Sages of the Midrash were alluding to the lights of the Dedication of the Hasmoneans, which applies [on the festival of Chanukah] even after the destruction of the Sanctuary, in our exile. Similarly the priestly blessing<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 6:24-26.</i> which is also juxtaposed to the dedication-offerings of the princes applies forever. Thus the Rabbis interpreted the proximity to the chapter of the dedication-offerings of the princes of both [the section] before and after it, in honor of Aaron who was not included with the princes [in those dedication-offerings].<br>Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra explains that this section was placed next to [the verse above, stating, <i>And when Moses went into the Tent of Meeting that He might speak with him …</i>],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 7:89.</i> in order “to inform us that the Divine communication [to Moses] would come at night as well, for there [in the Tent of Meeting] the lamp would be burning and would not become extinguished.” But this is not so according to the opinion of our Rabbis, who say:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mechilta <i>Pis’cha</i> 2.</i> “Did He not speak to him [Moses] only in the daytime?” And if Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra would have understood the difference between the prophecy [experienced by] Moses and that of the other prophets,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban clearly refers to the explanation of Rambam in his introduction to the tenth chapter of Tractate Sanhedrin, where he elucidates the ways in which the prophecy of Moses our teacher differed from that of all other prophets: “…Secondly, in the case of all other prophets, prophecy only comes to them either in the course of natural sleep … or when overtaken during the day by such a deep sleep as to be deprived of all consciousness, their minds being completely suspended … In the case of Moses, however, the word of G-d came to him during the day, and whilst he was standing between the two cherubim [of the ark of the covenant]” (see my translation of this introduction, in “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 275-276).</i> he would not have thought so [i.e., that the Divine communication also came to Moses at night]; as Scripture states, <i>If there be a prophet among you, I the Eternal do make Myself known unto him in a vision, I do speak with him in a dream. My servant Moses is not so</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 12:6-7.</i> for his prophecy was not through a dream, since dreams take place when it is actually night.

Therefore<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word “Therefore” is added in the Tur.</i> He commanded again afterwards, [so that it would be applicable] at once and for all generations, <i>Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure olive oil</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 24:2.</i> stating, <i>He</i> [Aaron] <i>shall set in order the lamps upon the pure candelabrum</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 4.</i> meaning that he may only set the lamps in order <i>upon the pure candelabrum</i>.

He did not mention the Tent of Meeting in this section, in order to instruct [us] that this [law] applies also in the Sanctuary [at Jerusalem], for one might have thought that because there were no windows in the Tent of Meeting it was necessary to have this light, whereas in the Sanctuary [at Jerusalem] where there were <i>windows broad within, and narrow without</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Kings 6:4.

But I do not know whether this [explanation that there was a five-year period of training for the Levites] is the unanimous opinion of our Rabbis, for I find it taught in the name of a single Rabbi in the Sifre:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifre <i>Beha’alothcha</i> 62.</i> “Rabbi Nathan says: One verse states, <i>From twenty and five years old</i> etc.” And it furthermore appears that these words [of the Sifre as quoted by Rashi] are merely Scriptural support for the practice of the pupils [i.e., the new Levites] who used to study the laws of the service for five years.<br>According to the plain meaning of Scripture, the [Levites] counted by the hand of Moses and Aaron were aged thirty years old and over, and it is they whom he appointed <i>every one to his service, and to his burden</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 4:49.</i> But here He commanded that every Levite who [although not counted by Moses] knows himself to have reached the age of twenty-five years, is permitted to do the service, and may <i>come with all the desire of his soul</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 18:6.</i> to work with them and help them in the service, but he may not be <i>a chief officer</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 20:1.</i> over any particular task. And the reason for this is that every person pays attention to [the passing of] his decades, since there are physical changes at these stages, therefore he knows when he reaches the age of twenty or thirty; for even his neighbors, relatives, his father and mother and his children notice it and inform him of it. But when a person reaches twenty-five years of age, they do not notice it so much; therefore He only commanded Moses to go to the trouble of counting those Levites above the age of thirty, when a man is recognizable by his years. And so did David say, <i>And the Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Chronicles 23:3. Thirty is the age when a person attains full strength (Aboth 5:24).</i><br>And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra said that the plain meaning of Scripture is that from thirty years old they were to do the work of bearing burdens, and from twenty-five years old they did work in the Tent of Meeting.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On the nature of the work in the Tent of Meeting, see Ramban on the verse that follows.</i> But this is not correct. For there also [when speaking of the Levites who were more than thirty years old] it is said, <i>all that came to perform the service, to do the work in the Tent of Meeting</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 4:23.</i> and it is also said [of this group], <i>to serve and to bear burdens</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 24.</i> Moreover, it is written of the Sanctuary: <i>These were the sons of Levi after their fathers’ houses, even the heads of the fathers’ houses, according to their numberings, in the number of names by their polls, who did the work for the service of the House of the Eternal, from twenty years old and upward. For David said: ‘The Eternal, the G-d of Israel, hath given rest unto His people, and He dwelleth in Jerusalem forever; and also the Levites shall no more have need to carry the Tabernacle and all the vessels of it for the service thereof.’ For by the last ordinances of David the sons of Levi were numbered from twenty years old and upward. For their station was at the side of the sons of Aaron for the service of the House of the Eternal, in the courts, and in the chambers</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Chronicles 23:24-28.</i> Thus it is stated that <i>by the last ordinances of David</i> when the House [of G-d] is built and the Levites no longer have to carry [the parts of the Tabernacle] on their shoulders, and their service will be only <i>in the courts, and in the chambers</i>, he counted them <i>from twenty years old and upward</i>, while at first [before the building of the Sanctuary] he counted them from the age of thirty upwards.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Chronicles 23:3.

But in the Sifre<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifre <i>Beha’alothcha</i> 63.</i> the Rabbis mentioned only that “he returns to close the gates or to the work of the sons of Gershon”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reference is also to the work of the sons of Merari, since the work of both of them [the sons of Gershon and Merari] consisted only of loading the wagons during transport, and serving as gate-keepers when the Tabernacle was in its place. The Sifre, however, speaks only of “the sons of Gershon” since they are mentioned (above, in Chapter 4, where the work was assigned to each of the three main families of the Levites) next to the sons of Kohath, whose work consisted of carrying the loads on their shoulders.</i> [but they did not say that he may return to the service of singing]! And this indeed appears correct [that a Levite above the age of fifty was not allowed to take part in the singing] — for if it were as the Rabbi [Rashi] has written, why were the twenty-year old Levites not appointed to sing, to close the gates and to load the wagons until they reached the required age,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, since the maximum age of fifty applied to the bearing of burdens, which was the specific work of the Kohathites — see above, Chapter 4 — but not to the service of singing, the minimum age of twenty-five likewise does not refer to the service of singing, and the same reasoning applies to serving as gate-keepers and loading the wagons. If so, why were the Levites [including the Kohathites] not counted from the age of twenty, and with no upper age limit?</i> and why were they counted from thirty to fifty years old and only for the work of bearing burdens [since both before and after these two age-limits they could still serve by singing etc., therefore they should have been counted from twenty years, with no upper limit]? Moreover, why were the sons of Gershon and Merari counted in this way [from thirty to fifty] since all their work [i.e., singing, closing the gates and loading the wagons] could be done when they were older?<br>We must rather say that since they were appointed to carry the ark at the age from thirty to fifty, they [therefore] were not appointed to sing, which was the main function of the Levites, unless they were also qualified to carry the ark, for all those who were appointed to sing were qualified to perform all the services [including the carrying of the ark]. And since the Kohathites [who were the only ones permitted to carry the ark] were counted from thirty to fifty years old, even for singing, they were all counted in this manner, in order that the sons of Gershon and Merari should not be qualified to sing during these years [i.e., <i>below</i> the age of thirty and <i>above</i> the age of fifty] and the sons of Kohath be disqualified. [Hence the age limits of thirty and fifty applied to the Kohathites’ singing, which was their main function, as well as to their carrying of the parts of the Tabernacle, and therefore these age limits applied to the function of singing of the sons of Gershon and Merari as well, and they could not, as Rashi wrote, return to the singing.] But for closing the gates or loading the wagons all of them were qualified [even after the age of fifty, as quoted in the Sifre above].

Pesachim 6b.</i> “There is no [strict] chronological order in the narrative of the Torah” [for the census mentioned at the beginning of this Book of Numbers was <i>on the first day of ‘the second’ month in the second year</i>, and the present chapter about the Passover was <i>in the ‘first month’</i> of the same year]! Now the reason for this delay [in mentioning the section concerning the Passover] was that since this fourth book [of the Torah] comes to mention the commandments which Israel was given in the wilderness of Sinai for that particular time, He wanted [first] to complete everything related to the Tent of Meeting and its functioning during all the time [that Israel was] in the wilderness. Therefore He mentioned first the [commandments about the four] standards, and the place of the Tent [of Meeting], and the position of its ministers, and the ordinance concerning the divisions [of the Levites] when carrying [the Tabernacle whilst travelling, and] all services of the Tent. Then He mentioned the dedication-offerings of the princes, who brought the wagons in which they would carry it [the Tent] as long as they were to be in the wilderness, and He finished [the account of] their offerings at the dedication of the altar, which began on the first of Nisan or afterwards.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See above. <i>Seder Naso</i>, Notes 131-132, which mention two opinions, to which Ramban alludes here.</i> After all this He returned and mentioned the admonition that He had given them not to forget the commandment of the Passover.<br>Now in the opinion of our Rabbis<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifre <i>Beha’alothcha</i> 67.</i> [the obligation to bring the Passover-offering] only applied in the wilderness in this [second] year, after the exodus because they did not perform circumcision in the wilderness,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reason for this is that during the years of G-d’s displeasure with Israel after the incident of the golden calf (Rashi), or that of the spies (Ramban), the north wind did not blow, and there was nothing to mitigate the effect of the extreme heat, so that it was dangerous to do the circumcision (Yebamoth 72 a, and see Rashi and Ramban there).

And in the opinion of our Rabbis<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifre <i>Beha’alothcha</i> 67.</i> they only brought the Passover-offering in this [second] year [after the exodus], because they begot sons and servants whom they could not circumcise, for the reason that the Rabbis mentioned, that it was dangerous [to observe circumcision], as is explained in Tractate Yebamoth.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reason for this is that during the years of G-d’s displeasure with Israel after the incident of the golden calf (Rashi), or that of the spies (Ramban), the north wind did not blow, and there was nothing to mitigate the effect of the extreme heat, so that it was dangerous to do the circumcision (Yebamoth 72 a, and see Rashi and Ramban there).

Or it may be that this Beraitha [of the Sifre which speaks of the “shortcoming” of Israel, as hinted at in this section] is in agreement with the words of the Sage<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Eliezer (Mechilta <i>Pis’cha</i> 15).</i> who holds that [non-performance of] circumcision of one’s male children or servants does <i>not</i> prevent one from eating the Passover-offering, and therefore the people were permitted to bring the Passover-offering, but they did not trouble themselves to do it, and this is indeed a great “shortcoming.” The first interpretation, however, appears more likely to be correct, for [had they been obliged to bring it] Moses would have forced them to observe it and would not have allowed them [by not bringing it] to incur the penalty of excision. But as for the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days, and the removal [over that period] of leavened bread, Scripture did not have to say that they observed it [in the wilderness], since these are commandments that are obligatory on everyone’s person and apply in all places, and it has already been stated [that they are to be observed] <i>throughout your generations by an ordinance forever</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 12:17.</i>"

A person who was on <i>a distant way</i> on the fourteenth of Nisan [or in a state of impurity] must bring the <i>second</i> Passover-offering, on the fourteenth of Iyar; but if he did not bring the second Passover-offering, even wilfully, he is not liable to punishment, since at the time of the first Passover-offering, when the main duty arose, he was unable to bring the offering. However, a person who was <i>not</i> on a distant way on the fourteenth of Nisan and did not bring the Passover-offering, may nonetheless bring the second Passover-offering on the fourteenth of Iyar; but if he wilfully did not bring it then on the fourteenth of Iyar he is subject to the punishment of excision.

Now since prior to that time there is no obligation to bring the offering yet, and Ula is of the opinion that a person on <i>a distant way</i> is “one who cannot come into the Sanctuary Court in time <i>for the slaughtering</i> of the Passover-offering,” it follows perforce that the term <i>a distant way</i> cannot mean in reality far away, since prior to the beginning of that afternoon there was no obligation to bring it yet. Hence even if the distance was actually not far but that person for some reason was not in the Sanctuary Court he is also considered as having been on <i>a distant way</i>. The case, however, would be different if he were to hold like Rav Yehudah, who says that a person on <i>a distant way</i> is “one who cannot come in, in time <i>for the eating</i> of the Passover-offering,” which is on the following night. In that case a person on <i>a distant way</i> would be one, who from the beginning of the afternoon cannot reach Jerusalem at night, in time for the eating of the Passover-offering, since he is actually on a far distant way.</i> This is indeed the plain meaning of Scripture, that a person who is situated at the beginning of the afternoon in a place from which he cannot reach the Sanctuary Court [on foot] by the time of the slaughtering, is considered as being on <i>a distant way</i>, and therefore he is free [from the obligation of bringing the Passover-offering]. It is possible that [according to Rabbi Akiba] the reason for the dot [on the letter <i>hei</i> in the word <i>r’chokah</i> (distant) in the Torah] is to indicate that it is too distant for him to bring the Passover-offering, even though it is not actually distant [since fifteen-miles — walking-distance — is the required distance]; therefore when He repeated it He stated, <i>But the man that is clean, and is not on ‘a journey,’</i> [<i>and forbeareth to bring the Passover-lamb</i>],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">86</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 13.</i> and did not mention “distant.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">87</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For had Verse 13 said: “and he was not on a <i>distant</i> journey,” it would have implied that even if he was beyond a distance of fifteen miles and fails to bring the Passover-offering, he is liable to the punishment of excision. But this is not the law, for if he were beyond fifteen miles the punishment does not apply. See Note 83 above.</i><br>Now Scripture commanded that a person who was impure or on a distant way should bring the second [Passover-offering], but the same law, for the same reason, applies to anyone who did not bring the first Passover-offering, even wilfully, namely that he is obliged to bring the second Passover-offering, in accordance with the words of our Rabbis.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">88</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Pesachim 93b. See “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 67-69.</i> Scripture, however, mentioned only [those who were impure or on a distant way in order] to say that they are allowed to bring the second Passover-offering, and to forbid an <i>impure</i> person to bring the <i>first</i> Passover-offering. However, one who was on a [distant] way is free from bringing the first Passover-offering, and <i>may</i> bring the second one, but if he wants to fulfill his duty on the first Passover and he told someone [in Jerusalem to include him in a group, and] to slaughter the offering for him [as well], it is acceptable [for him]. For we accept [as the correct interpretation of the law]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">89</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Pesachim 92b. This is the opinion of Rav Nachman.</i> that the [meaning of the verse is not that he <i>must</i> bring it only on the second Passover, but that the] Merciful One dealt kindly with him [and <i>allowed</i> him if he prefers to bring the second Passover-offering], but if he did bring [the first one] — he is deserving of a blessing [and he has acted rightly]. It is also possible that the reason why Scripture mentioned “distant” [is because it is referring to a journey which is <i>actually</i> far away, and only then <i>must</i> he bring the second Passover-offering], but if he is on a “near” journey [i.e., <i>within</i> fifteen miles — this distance being considered the beginning of what is technically already “a far way”], he <i>may</i> bring the second Passover-offering, <i>or</i> the first one, by [telling them] to slaughter it and sprinkle it for him as well [in the afternoon of the fourteenth day of Nisan], and then coming [into the city of Jerusalem] and eating the Passover-offering at night."

Perhaps the Rabbi [Rashi] thought that these episodes were not written in their [chronological] order, and that He [already] alluded to the first [punishment] in saying, [<i>and they set forward</i>] <i>from the mount of the Eternal</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">141</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 33.</i> for perhaps they already intended to do so [to demand meat] from the time that they set forth on that journey; but He made a break [by writing the section of the ark], and then wrote the second [punishment, i.e., that of the murmurers], and afterwards He went back to [relate the actual realization of their original intention to ask for meat, namely] the first punishment.

The correct interpretation appears to me to be that as they got further away from Mount Sinai, which was near an inhabitable settlement, and entered <i>the great and dreadful wilderness</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">150</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 1:19.</i> in their first journey, they became upset and said: “What shall we do? How shall we live in this wilderness? What shall we eat and what shall we drink? How shall we endure the trouble and the suffering, and when shall we come out of here?” The word <i>k’mithon’nim</i> is thus related to the expression, <i>Wherefore doth a living man ‘yithonein’</i> (<i>complain</i>), <i>a strong man because of his sins?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">151</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lamentations 3:39.</i> which is an expression indicating pain, and feeling sorry for oneself.

The point is thus clear: there will not be anything “too hard” for them.</i> Similarly at the Giving of the Torah [special prominence was given to] <i>seventy elders of Israel</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">200</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 24:1.</i> and it is fitting that the Glory of the Divine Presence should rest upon [a group of] this perfect number, since it is [comparable to] the camp on high, for Israel are <i>the hosts of the Eternal</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">201</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 12:41.

The intention of the verse is to say that the transmission [of the spirit resting on Moses to the seventy elders] will take place at the time when G-d will speak to Moses; and it will be from that [Divine communication that the prophetic power will be transmitted to them],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">214</sup><i class=\"footnote\">So clearly explained in the Tur. See my Hebrew commentary p. 234.</i> as is stated at the actual occurrance [of the events], <i>And the Eternal came down in the cloud, and spoke unto him</i>, [<i>and took of the spirit that was upon him, and put it upon the seventy elders</i>].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">215</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 25.</i> Now Scripture did not explain here what this communication was about, as is [usually] written in the whole Torah, where after [stating that G-d spoke to Moses] it explains what the Eternal said and what He spoke. [The reason for this is] that what happened here was that the elders, of whom Scripture states that they prophesied,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">215</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 25.</i> did not hear any communication from the mouth of G-d, nor did He appear to them <i>in a vision</i> or <i>in a dream</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">216</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See further, 12:6.</i> but G-d spoke to Moses, and from the <i>atziluth</i> [as is explained further on] of the spirit upon Moses, they understood that Divine communication. This is the sense of the expression, <i>and they prophesied, but they did so no more</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">215</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 25.</i> meaning that they did not continue receiving Divine communication on their own, for it was only the communication that G-d said to Moses in which they shared. This is also the meaning of <i>v’atzalti</i> [of the root <i>eitzel</i> — “near”], that “I will hold back with Me of the spirit which I put upon you, <i>and I will put it upon them</i>.” This is not the same idea as in the verse, <i>and thou</i> [Moses] <i>shalt put of thy honor upon him</i> [Joshua],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">217</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 27:20.</i> for the term <i>atziluth</i> always means “holding something back,” as in the expressions: <i>And whatsoever mine eyes desired ‘lo atzalti’</i> (<i>I did not keep</i>) <i>from them;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">218</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ecclesiastes 2:10.</i> <i>‘Halo atzalta’</i> (<i>Hast thou not reserved</i>) <i>a blessing for me?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">219</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 27:36.</i> Similarly, [<i>Now the upper chambers were shorter, for the galleries took away from these, more than from the lower and the middlemost, in the building. For they were in three stories, and they had not pillars as the pillars of the courts;</i>] <i>therefore ‘ne’etzal’</i> (<i>room was taken away</i>) <i>from the lowest and the middlemost, in comparison with the ground</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">220</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 42:5-6.</i> meaning that more [room] was left by them [i.e., the upper chambers] relative to the ground, than by the chambers on the bottom and middle [stories], since their galleries did not take away from these upper chambers.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">221</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The meaning is as follows: It is clear from the verses that there were three stories, and that they were not supported on pillars. Thus each floor had to be set in somewhat in relation to the floor below it, leaving “galleries” around it. The top floor was the shortest, since the lower ones protruded and covered more of the ground-area than the highest story; thus more room was left relative to the ground by the top floor than by the other two. This shows that the root <i>‘atzal’</i> used in the verse signifies “holding back.”</i> Likewise, <i>and to the ‘atzilei’ of the children of Israel</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">222</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 24:11.</i> means “those who were left and were separated from them, who were withdrawn to themselves from the rest of the ordinary people.” Or it may be that great men are so called [<i>atzilim</i> — from the root <i>eitzel</i> (near)] because everybody comes to them [for counsel and instruction]. And translators of languages<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">223</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban is obviously referring to translators from Arabic into Hebrew. See e.g., in Yehudah Halevi’s philosophic work Al Khazari, written in Arabic, which Ibn Tibbon rendered into Hebrew, where he writes of <i>atziluth ne’etzeleth mimenah sibah shenith</i> (an Emanation from which emanated a second) etc. (Hirschfeld’s translation, I, 1, p. 36).</i> use the term <i>atziluth</i> with reference to an emanation of any powers [coming forth] from the Creator and spreading to a created object. Thus they speak of the soul as <i>atzulah</i> (emanating) from <i>Ruach Hakodesh</i> (<i>the Holy Spirit</i>), since they understand <i>atziluth</i> as an expression of “drawing forth.” But it does not appear to me to be correct that <i>atziluth</i> should mean “drawing forth” or<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">224</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Or placing upon etc.” — In Kur Zahav it is suggested that the reading in Ramban should be [instead of: <i>o hanachah</i> — “or placing upon”]<i>: ela hanachah</i> — “but placing upon.” That is to say, Ramban differs with the translators who understood <i>atziluth</i> as an act of both, coming forth from one subject and spreading to another, while Ramban holds it is primarily a concept of “placing upon” a subject, part of something which the bestower has set aside for it. — See further my Hebrew commentary p. 235.</i> “placing upon” [the receiver], something which the bestower has set aside [for him]. Onkelos, however, explained that the term <i>atziluth</i> has two meanings. Thus he translated here [<i>v’atzalti</i>] — “and I shall make great” [thus indicating that the term <i>atziluth</i> is to be understood as a “drawing forth” by the giver for the benefit of the receiver, that he will be made great], and similarly <i>and to the ‘atzilei’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">222</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 24:11.</i> [he translated], “and to the great men;” but he rendered <i>‘Halo atzalta’ a blessing for me</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">219</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 27:36.</i> — “Have you not ‘left’ for me a blessing?” Thus it appears that his opinion about the meaning of <i>atziluth</i> is that it [sometimes] refers to a drawing forth or bestowing by a giver on a receiver; thus [according to this interpretation] the verse here is saying: “I will draw forth from that which is upon you [Moses] of the spirit of prophecy, <i>and I will put it upon them</i>.” But we may [also use the term <i>atziluth</i> in speaking of] a “drawing forth” which a giver does to himself from that which is given, so that it remains with him, this being the meaning of the verse, <i>‘Halo atzalta’ a blessing for me</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">219</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 27:36.</i> — “Have you not kept to yourself for me one of the blessings with which to bless me?”<br>The general principle about the elders is that their Divine communication came only from [G-d’s] spirit which spoke to Moses, and from him it came to them. Therefore the Rabbis have said in Bamidbar Sinai Rabbah:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">225</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Bamidbar Rabbah, at the end of <i>Seder Beha’alothcha</i>.</i> “This can be compared to a master who gave an orchard to a guardian, and paid him a wage for his service. After a while the guardian said to him: ‘I cannot guard the whole orchard alone; bring in some more people to guard it with me.’ Thereupon the master said to him: ‘I gave you my orchard to guard, and all the fruits for guarding it I gave you [i.e., I gave you a reward for it], and now you tell me to bring in others to guard it with you! I will bring in others to help you guard it, but you should know that I will not give them wages for watching it out of my resources; rather it is from the wages that I have given you that they will take their payment.’ So did the Holy One, blessed be He, say to Moses: ‘I have given you spirit and knowledge to lead My children, and I did not want anyone else [to help you], in order that you alone should be singled out for this guardianship, and now you want someone else! Know then that from Me they will not take anything, but <i>I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them</i>.’ Yet nonetheless Moses did not lose anything [of his spirit].” Thus far is in the Midrash.<br>It appears likely to me that this [bestowing of the Divine spirit that was upon Moses] happened to the elders throughout their lives, so that they knew whatever G-d commanded Israel by the hand of Moses in connection with the temporary needs of the people and the events which happened to them in the wilderness. This is the meaning of the expression [in the verse before us] <i>and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee</i>, that whatever Moses told the people they knew, and each one would pass the Divine communication about it to the people of his tribe, and thus Moses no longer had to bear their complaints alone."

Shall the flock and herds be slaughtered for them so that they [the people] will be killed immediately, and this eating should be their last, satisfying them forever!” Then G-d said to Moses: <i>Now shalt thou see</i> etc. (see note that follows).</i> and of Rabbi Yehudah Hanasi<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">237</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In our Rashi: “Rabban Gamaliel the son of Rabbi Yehudah Hanasi.” This Sage explains that Moses said: “Since they are merely seeking a pretext, Thou wilt never be able to satisfy them, for they will always beg for something else.” — Then G-d said to Moses: “<i>Now shalt thou see whether My word shall come to pass unto thee or not</i> (Verse 23) — for they will not listen unto thee.” Moses then went to appease them and told them what G-d said to him: <i>Is the hand of the Eternal waxed short</i>? (<i>ibid.</i>) But the people answered that He indeed has no power to grant their request. This is what the following verse [24] means: <i>And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the Eternal</i>. Since, however, they refused to listen to him, the verse continues, <i>and he gathered seventy men</i> etc.</i> do not fit in properly with the language of Scripture, because He said, <i>Now shalt thou see whether My word shall come to pass unto thee or not</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">238</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban’s intent is as follows: Had Verse 23 stated: “<i>And the Eternal said unto Moses: ‘Is the hand of the Eternal waxed short?’</i> And Moses said: ‘I will go to appease them.’ And G-d said to him: ‘They will not listen unto thee. <i>Now shalt thou see whether My word shall come to pass unto thee</i> [that they will not listen unto thee] <i>or not …</i>’” the interpretations of Rabbi Shimon and of Rabbi Yehudah Hanasi would have fitted in with the text of Scripture. But all which is written after the phrase, <i>Is the hand of the Eternal waxed short?</i> is: <i>Now shalt thou see</i> etc. which implies that Moses, as it were, doubted that G-d would satisfy them. Hence we must offer another interpretation, as set forth in the text that follows.</i> And the interpretation of Rabbi Akiba who says that the words [of Moses] are to be taken literally, namely “Will it be enough for them?” is the true sense of Scripture, and this is the opinion of Onkelos [who translated <i>umatza lahem</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">239</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Note 236, quoting Verse 23.</i> — “will it suffice them?”]. But the event itself is amazing, as Rabbi Shimon said [commenting on Rabbi Akiba’s interpretation]: “The person of whom Scripture writes, <i>he is trusted in all My house</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">240</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 12:7.</i> would he say that G-d cannot supply enough for them!” Moreover, all of them had already seen far greater wonders than this! And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra answered this [by saying] that Moses thought that G-d would not create a new wonder except to vindicate His prophet [as happened in the affair of Korach, further, Chapter 16; and since the truth of his prophecy was not now in question, Moses thought that no miracle would happen merely to satisfy the people’s requests]. But this too, does not appear correct to me, for He had already done for them [a miracle] of this sort with the first quail,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">241</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 16:13.</i> and also with the water<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">242</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 17:6.</i> and the manna,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">243</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Chapter 16.</i> for all of these things were given to them to satisfy their complaints.<br>The correct interpretation appears to me to be that when G-d does signs and wonders for Israel, they are deeds of kindness from Him, and they are all for their good, for <i>The Eternal is good to all; and His tender mercies are over all His works</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">244</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 145:9.</i> except when <i>there is wrath gone out</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">245</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 17:11.</i> against those who transgress His Will, when He acts towards them with anger and the attribute of judgment to their complete punishment. Thus miracles can only be [manifestations of] complete and perfect goodness in mercy, or retribution by the attribute of judgment. But now when G-d told Moses that He would fulfill their request and they would eat meat <i>until it cometh out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">246</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 19.</i> Moses our teacher knew that there would not be a wonder from G-d to supply them with flesh as He gave them <i>the corn of heaven</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">247</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 78:24.</i> similar to which the Sages say:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">248</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Bereshith Rabbah 51:5.</i> “No evil thing comes down from heaven.” Moreover, all miracles He told Moses about beforehand: <i>Behold, I will cause to rain bread from heaven for you;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">249</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 16:4.</i> <i>Behold, I will stand before thee there on the rock in Horeb;</i> [<i>and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it</i>].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">250</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 17:6.</i> But here since He told him, <i>And say unto the people: Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">251</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 18.</i> and He did not inform him [that he would then give them meat, as He informed about the other miracles], Moses understood that there would be no miracle from Him, blessed be He. Therefore he asked in astonishment: “What can He do [to satisfy] them by natural means? If all the flocks and herds around them be slaughtered for them they will still not be satisfied, and if all the fish of the sea in the place nearest to them be gathered in for them it would still not be sufficient for them.” Therefore G-d answered that His hand is not too short to fulfill their request even by ordinary events, this being the meaning of the expression <i>‘ha’yikrecha’</i> [of the root <i>mikreh</i> — “chance”] <i>My word or not</i>, [i.e., <i>Now shalt thou see whether My word ‘shall suffice for thee even by chance’</i>]. And He said, <i>Is the Eternal’s ‘yad’</i> (<i>hand</i>) <i>waxed short</i>, similar to the expression, <i>and royal wine in abundance, according to the ‘yad’</i> (<i>bounty</i>) <i>of the king</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">252</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Esther 1:7.</i> but He did not say, <i>Is there anything too hard for me?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">253</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 32:27.</i> since this was not done by a wonder.

Therefore Joshua said to Moses, <i>“Shut them in</i>, for perhaps <i>it is a lying spirit</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">256</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Kings 22:22.</i> in their mouths, or it is <i>an evil spirit</i> that <i>terrifies</i> them,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">257</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See I Samuel 16:14.</i> and thus they must be put in a prison like <i>a man that is mad, and maketh himself like a prophet.”</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">258</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 29:26.</i> But Moses in his humility answered: “<i>Would that all the people of the Eternal were prophets, that the Eternal would give His spirit upon them!</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">259</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 29.</i> — for G-d put His spirit directly upon them without taking of the spirit which was upon me, and would that this would happen to all the people.”<br>However, from the words of our Rabbis it appears that the custom in Israel was that no one would prophesy about future events in the presence of a prophet who is greater than him, but they would follow him as his disciples, and these were <i>the sons of the prophets</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">260</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Kings 20:35. Rambam defines <i>the sons of the prophets</i> as “those who sought the prophetic gift. And although they directed their minds towards it, the Divine Spirit might or might not rest upon them” (<i>Hilchoth Yesodei Hatorah</i> 7:5).</i> Thus the Rabbis have said in Tractate Sanhedrin [with reference to the prophecy of Eldad and Medad]:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">261</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 17 a.</i> “We can well understand according to that Sage who said that [Eldad and Medad prophesied that] ‘Moses will die [before entering the Land],’ that Joshua therefore said, <i>My lord Moses, shut them in</i> [since he wished to save Moses from grief]. But according to the Sage who said that [they prophesied] about the quails [that they would come from the sea], why should they be shut in [and not prophesy]? It is because the case resembled that of a pupil who renders a decision in the presence of his master.” Similarly [this was the reason why they were forbidden to prophesy] according to the Sage who says that they prophesied about Gog and Magog.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">262</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 38:17.</i> And the Rabbis have mentioned a similar case in Tractate Megillah in the matter of Deborah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">263</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Megillah 14 b the Talmud lists the seven prophetesses that prophesied in Israel, mentioning among them Deborah, Huldah, etc. It is related in the Book of Kings that King Josiah of Judah sent to Huldah a delegation to inquire about a certain matter (II Kings 22:14). On this the Gemara asked: “But how could Huldah prophesy whilst Jeremiah [[illegible]] the leading prophet in Jerusalem — was present?” To this question the answer is given that “Huldah was a relative of Jeremiah and therefore he did not mind her prophesying.” Thus it is clear from this text that there was a rule in Israel that no one should prophesy in the presence of a greater prophet. Ramban’s mentioning “Deborah” is merely a reference to the text in the Gemara which begins this discussion, but the actual reference is to Huldah, as explained above.</i> But Moses said that he, being the master, foregoes the honor due to him [and the law is that a Rabbi is able to renounce the honor due to him],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">264</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kiddushin 32 a.</i> and he desires and is happy [that they prophesy]. And I have seen that the Targum Yerushalmi<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">265</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is found in our Targum Yonathan ben Uziel.</i> rendered: “<i>k’la’eim</i> — withhold from them the Holy Spirit.” The Targum thus understood the word <i>k’la’eim</i> to be like the expressions: <i>Behold, ‘lo echla’</i> (<i>I did not refrain</i>) <i>my lips;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">266</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 40:10.</i> <i>‘lo thichla’</i> (<i>Thou wilt not withhold</i>) <i>Thy compassions from me</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">267</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 12.</i><br>Now the reason for this matter is that Joshua thought that [Eldad and Medad] were prophesying because <i>they were of them that were recorded</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">268</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 26.</i> [among the prescribed number of seventy men that were to join Moses], because the spirit of Moses was transmitted to all <i>that were recorded</i>, for he intended that all [seventy of them should become prophets]. Therefore Joshua said to Moses: “It is not fitting that they [Eldad and Medad] should prophesy <i>in the camp</i>, since they did not fulfill the word of G-d who commanded: <i>and thou</i> [Moses] <i>shalt bring them unto the Tent of Meeting, that they may stand there with thee</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">269</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 16.</i> and thus it might appear that not all of them prophesied through His putting of the spirit which was upon you [on them]. It is therefore fitting for my lord to direct your mind towards the spirit of G-d [which is upon you] and to bring it [completely] back to you, so that it should not be taken from you except for those who stand before you in accordance with the word of G-d. For it was because you intended at first that all <i>who were recorded</i> [should be prophets] that some of your glory came upon them, and if you will now intend to withdraw it from them, it will come to rest only upon those who stand before you in accordance with the word of G-d.” But Moses answered [Joshua by saying] that he should not be zealous for his sake, for he wishes that they prophesy whether in his presence or outside it, since G-d had put His spirit upon them — either by transmission from Moses or [directly from G-d] without such a transmission."

Therefore Scripture uses the term <i>pith’om</i> [only] on account of Aaron and Miriam, for Moses our teacher was fit for a Divine communication at any time, and his mind was prepared to cleave to <i>the Glorious Name</i> at every moment, as our Rabbis have explained in connection with the reason why he [Moses] separated himself from his wife.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">273</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shabbath 87 a: Since the Divine Glory reveals itself to me at all times [and there is no definite time fixed for the Divine communication] …”</i> Onkelos, however, rendered [the word <i>pith’om</i>] as <i>bithkeiph</i> (in a hurry), the sense being that whilst Miriam and Aaron were still speaking about Moses, and the words were still in their mouths, they were told: <i>Come out ye three unto the Tent of Meeting</i>, and He did not delay [the rebuke] to them at all.

Ibn Ezra explains it by adding the word <i>navi</i> (prophet), which is in construct with <i>Hashem</i> — “the prophet of the Eternal.” The reason why Ibn Ezra is forced to do so is because when a noun is in construct it cannot have a pronoun as a suffix, and here it says <i>nevi’achem Hashem</i>, the word <i>nevi’achem</i> having such a pronoun as a suffix. Hence Ibn Ezra adds the word <i>navi</i> (the prophet of), to be in construct with the noun <i>Hashem</i>. The sense of the verse is thus: <i>Im yih’yeh nevi’achem ‘nevi’ Hashem</i>.</i> as in [the expression] <i>and the prophecy of Oded the prophet</i>.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">284</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Chronicles 15:8. The meaning thereof is: “and the prophecy, a prophecy of Oded the prophet.” The point here is that a noun which is in the construct cannot have the prefix <i>hei</i>, which indicates the definite article. Here it is stated: <i>v’hanevua Oded</i>. Hence Ibn Ezra explains it by adding the word <i>nevuath</i> (a prophecy of), making the sense of the phrase: “and the prophecy, a prophecy of Oded the prophet.”</i> He has explained it well. Thus the meaning of the verse is that “even if there is a prophet among you who is a [true] prophet of the Eternal, he can only prophesy by My Great Name through a vision or in riddles.” He mentions this [“if he be a true prophet of the Eternal”] because many prophets did not attain even this [stage], but were prophets by virtue of the Holy Spirit, as it is said, <i>The spirit of the Eternal spoke by me</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">285</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Samuel 23:2.</i> this being the “hand” mentioned in connection with Ezekiel,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">286</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 1:3.

The verse continues that the people said to Moses: ‘<i>Let us send men before us, that they may search the Land for us, and bring us back word</i> etc.’</i> that is to say, the cities into which we shall come first, and from which we will enter the whole country. Now this is the correct guidance [to give] to anyone who [plans to] conquer a country. And so did Moses himself do, as it is said, <i>And Moses sent to spy out Jazer</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 21:32.</i> and Joshua the son of Nun also [sent] <i>two spies</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 2:1.</i> It was for this reason that [the people’s request to send out scouts] pleased Moses,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 1:23. In other words, since Moses was aware of G-d’s displeasure with the whole mission, why did he say that <i>the thing pleased me well</i>?</i> for Scripture does not [allow man] to rely on a miracle in any of its affairs. Instead, it commands those who go out to battle to arm themselves, to take [all necessary] precautions, and to set ambushes [if needed], as Scripture relates in connection with the battle for [the city of] Ai, which was by command of G-d,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 8:2. Thus the method of ambush was also by command of G-d, thereby teaching that in war we are not to rely on miracles.</i> and similarly in many places. Then Moses consulted the Divine Presence and G-d gave him permission, saying, “<i>Send thee men, that they may spy out the land of Canaan</i> and become acquainted with it, and bring back a report to you, and according to their information you should take counsel regarding the conquest.” Now Moses told the spies, <i>Get you up here into the south</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 17. The literal translation is: “Go up this, into the south;” therefore Ramban explains that it means “go up by this road into the south.” It is also so explained by Ibn Ezra. In Targum Yonathan it is rendered: “Go up by this side, by the south.”</i> meaning: “Go up by this road into the south so that you will get to know the people who live in the land of the south — [this being] the direction from which Israel was [approaching] — [and see] <i>whether they are strong</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 18.</i> and [the Israelites] when dealing with them will need to be very much on their guard and well-armed; similarly, [see] <i>the cities</i>, and whether they are fortified so that [the inhabitants] are well-entrenched, and it will therefore be necessary to build forts and ramps, or [even] to come against them from another direction.” Moses further told them that they should get to know <i>the Land</i> itself, <i>whether it is good or bad</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 19.</i> and if it is bad, they should first conquer other parts [of it]; for they spied out the hill-country of the Amorites from the side of Hebron,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 22.</i> and even Joshua did not conquer all [areas of the Land], — this being the meaning of the expression <i>and what the Land is that they dwell in</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 19.</i> meaning the people who live in the land of the south.<br>[Furthermore] it is possible that it was because Moses knew that it is a fertile and good land, — as he was told, <i>unto a good Land and a large one, unto a Land flowing with milk and honey</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 3:8.</i> — that he told them to set their minds ascertaining this [fact], so that [upon their return] they would tell the people about it, and they would rejoice and gain renewed strength to go up there in joy. Therefore he told them, <i>And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the Land</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 20.</i> so that they [the people] would see with their own eyes the goodness of the Land. Now it is well-known that Egypt is not very far from Hebron — approximately a seven-days’ journey distant — and the border of the land of Canaan comes close to Egypt, and it is therefore impossible that people who live in Egypt should not know about the land of Canaan <i>whether it is good or bad</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 19.</i> And indeed Moses’ intention was to find out the way by which he should go up, and the cities which he was to capture first, as I have explained. However, since the Israelites in Egypt were slaves doing most rigorous work, <i>they did not know, neither did they understand</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 82:5.</i> [the nature of the Land], therefore Moses wanted the spies to tell them all the particulars of the Land in order to cause them to rejoice in its qualities, since he [himself] knew of them [as explained above.].<br>Now it appears to me from the language of Scripture that Moses did <i>not</i> [in fact] consult the Divine Presence [as to whether he should send spies at all], but the meaning of <i>Send thee men</i> is that they [the people] had decided [already] to send spies, and it was customary to send <i>two spies secretly, saying:</i> [<i>‘Go view the Land’</i>],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 2:1.</i> and that they be taken [only] from some [tribes of the people]; but G-d Who knows the future commanded Moses [here] to send <i>one man from each of the tribes</i> of Israel, <i>every one a prince among them</i>. [This is because] G-d wanted all the great men to be [represented] equally in this matter, so that perhaps <i>they</i> would <i>remember and turn unto the Eternal</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 22:28.</i> and if not, so that the decree [of punishment] would apply equally to the whole people, this being the meaning of the expression [that Moses sent them] <i>according to the commandment of the Eternal</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 3. Thus the burden of punishment, instead of falling heavily upon a particular tribe or tribes, would be more lightly distributed throughout the camp. Moreover, by commanding that the heads of the tribes should lead the mission, the people would avoid total responsibility and thus be spared annihilation. This latter point is made clear by Ramban in the text that follows.</i> for it was by command of G-d that they were to be <i>princes</i> and <i>heads of the children of Israel</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 3. Thus the burden of punishment, instead of falling heavily upon a particular tribe or tribes, would be more lightly distributed throughout the camp. Moreover, by commanding that the heads of the tribes should lead the mission, the people would avoid total responsibility and thus be spared annihilation. This latter point is made clear by Ramban in the text that follows.</i><br>It [further] appears to me according to the plain meaning of Scripture that G-d [in speaking] to Moses did not refer [at all] to the request which the people had made, to send out spies, nor to Moses’ consent to that request, for if that were the case, Scripture here would have related: “And the children of Israel approached Moses and said: <i>Let us send men before us</i> etc.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 1:22. The verse continues that the people said to Moses: ‘<i>Let us send men before us, that they may search the Land for us, and bring us back word</i> etc.’</i> <i>And the thing pleased</i> Moses <i>well</i>,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 1:23. In other words, since Moses was aware of G-d’s displeasure with the whole mission, why did he say that <i>the thing pleased me well</i>?</i> and afterwards it would have written: “<i>And the Eternal spoke unto Moses, saying:</i> ‘<i>Send thee men</i> as they have spoken to you, <i>one man</i> etc.’” But the matter was as follows. The Israelites asked to send [spies], <i>and the thing pleased</i> Moses <i>well</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 1:23. In other words, since Moses was aware of G-d’s displeasure with the whole mission, why did he say that <i>the thing pleased me well</i>?</i> and afterwards a Divine communication came to Moses, as did all other such communications, merely saying, <i>Send thee men</i>, this being the reason [for the necessity of the subsequent explanatory words], <i>that they may spy out the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel</i>, as He is speaking of a new matter about which nothing has [hitherto] been related. All this was because <i>the Eternal was pleased, for His righteousness’ sake</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 42:21.</i> that the mission be at His command, and that it be with [the participation of] all their tribes and their great men, so that [the people] should be saved.<br>Similarly it appears that they asked of Moses, <i>Let us send men before us, ‘v’yachperu’</i> (<i>that they may search</i>) <i>the Land for us</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 1:22. The verse continues that the people said to Moses: ‘<i>Let us send men before us, that they may search the Land for us, and bring us back word</i> etc.’</i> which means spying out the roads and [working out] the strategy of conquest, similar to the expression <i>from there ‘chaphar’</i> (<i>he spieth out</i>) <i>the prey</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 39:29.</i> This is the meaning of [the words] <i>before us</i> [<i>Let us send men ‘before us’</i>],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 1:22. The verse continues that the people said to Moses: ‘<i>Let us send men before us, that they may search the Land for us, and bring us back word</i> etc.’</i> for they [the Israelites] would follow them [later on] in their route, similar to the expression, <i>and the ark of the covenant went ‘before them’</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above 10:33.</i> G-d, however, commanded <i>‘v’yathuru’ the land of Canaan</i>, which refers to a choice, as is made by those who come to buy something, similar in expression to the verse, <i>beside that which ‘mei’anshei hatarim’</i> (<i>the traffickers</i>) <i>and merchants</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Chronicles 9:14.</i> Similarly: <i>into a land that ‘tarti’</i> (<i>I had sought out</i>) <i>for them;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 20:6.</i> also, <i>‘lathur’</i> (<i>to seek out</i>) <i>a resting-place for them</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above 10:33.</i> Therefore Moses commanded them to state specifically <i>whether it is good or bad … whether it is fat or lean</i> etc.,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verses 19-20.</i> all this being in order to cause them to rejoice, for <i>it is the beauty of all lands</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 20:6.</i> and they would go up to it with great eagerness. Thus this subject is related here without explanation [of the exact sequence of events leading up to the sending of the spies], as it occurred, but in the Book of Deuteronomy Moses mentioned to them all the happenings from their beginning, in order <i>to declare</i> to them <i>their transgression</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Isaiah 58:1.</i> that they sinned by their [very] request which they themselves initiated.<br>In the opinion of our Rabbis<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mentioned by Rashi at the beginning of this verse: “I told them [at the time of the exodus] that it is a good Land etc.”</i> their sin was in saying <i>Let us send men before us</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 1:22. The verse continues that the people said to Moses: ‘<i>Let us send men before us, that they may search the Land for us, and bring us back word</i> etc.’</i> because they had seen <i>the salvation of the Eternal</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 14:13.</i> which He continually did for them, and they should have followed the cloud <i>whither the spirit was to go</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 1:12.</i> and Moses accepted their request to fulfill their desire. The meaning, then, of [the verse] <i>And the thing pleased me well</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 1:23. In other words, since Moses was aware of G-d’s displeasure with the whole mission, why did he say that <i>the thing pleased me well</i>?</i> is: “I endured your evil plan and directed that it be done”. And G-d commanded him that he send <i>one man of every tribe of their fathers</i> etc., just like it is said in the case of Samuel, <i>Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee; for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected Me, that I should not be King over them</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 8: 7. In that case too, the Divine consent was given only on account of the people’s intransigence for having a king appointed over them. The matter, however, was displeasing to G-d because their devoted leader Samuel was still alive.</i> Now these men [who were sent out as spies] were not <i>pointed out by name</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 1:17.</i> by the word of G-d, as was the case at the census<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 1:17.</i> and at the division of the Land,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 34:19-28.</i> for no mishap occurs to those who carry out the command of G-d, and <i>whoso keepeth the commandment shall know no evil thing</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ecclesiastes 8:5.</i> Therefore He, blessed be He, only commanded Moses <i>one man of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send</i> etc., and that they be princes, and Moses at his own discretion chose these men and sent them, and <i>they wrought evil unto themselves</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 3:9.</i>"

[If so, the question arises why Moses continued with the apparently superfluous command to find out <i>whether</i> the Land <i>is fat or lean</i>, since it is already included in the phrases <i>good</i> and <i>bad</i>?] It is possible, however, that a good land is fruitful and its fruits are fat, and it produces fat products such as balsam and oil,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 27:17.</i> dates and figs and similar things.

Thus [by saying that the spies are to ascertain <i>whether</i> the Land <i>is fat or lean</i> Moses] meant “whether it is a fat land, as valleys are, or a lean land like the mountains.” Onkelos, however, translated [<i>whether it is fat or lean</i> as] “whether it is rich or poor,” for there are countries whose inhabitants are rich because of the low prices prevalent among them, and their neighbors trade with them in all the good things found among them, and there are some countries whose inhabitants are dependent upon their neighbors <i>and their inhabitants are of small power</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Kings 19:26.</i> although they are good [lands] and not at all bad.<br><i>‘And be ye of good courage’, and bring</i> [<i>of the fruit of the Land</i>].

Rather, you must say that [the meaning of the word <i>nivnethah</i>] is <i>m’vunah</i> (“built up” — i.e., furnished, supplied) with all excellent qualities, seven times more than Zoan [in Egypt]. The verse thus comes to tell you of the wonderful quality of the Land of Israel.” This is Rashi’s language.<br>It appears to me according to the plain meaning [of Scripture] that Hebron is Kiryath-arba, the greatest man of the Anakim having the name Arba, and it was he who built it [Hebron], therefore it was called by his name; just as it is said, <i>Now the name of Hebron beforetime was Kiryath-arba, which Arba was the greatest man among the Anakim</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 14:15.</i> This man begot a son whom he named Anak, and it was after him that they [the inhabitants of Hebron] were called Anakim. Therefore Scripture states [here in our verse] that <i>there</i> in Hebron <i>were Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, and Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt</i>, meaning to say that Arba built it for his son Anak seven years before the building of Zoan in Egypt, which was an ancient city. [Scripture thereby] tells of the longevity of these people, for just as they were exceptional in their height so also they lived longer than other peoples; since Hebron was built [by Arba] for their father [i.e., Anak, the father of these giants <i>Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai</i>] before Zoan in Egypt, and many generations had elapsed since then [the founding of Zoan] until now.<br>It is possible that [in saying that <i>Hebron was built seven years before Zoan</i> Scripture] is alluding to that which it said, <i>whether it is fat or lean</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 20.</i> [implying] that Hebron was very ancient and nonetheless still produced fat and large fruits, as Scripture tells about the bunch of grapes,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 24.</i> and how much more so the newer [parts of the] Land, which was more fertile.<br>It may be that Arba [and not, as explained above, a son of his, called Anak], was the father of Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, and he was called Arba [literally “four”] because there were [altogether] four <i>Anakim</i> [“giants” — the three sons, <i>Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai</i>, and their father. According to this we would not have to postulate, as explained above, the existence of a son of Arba whom he named Anak, and who was the ancestor of the people called Anakim]. And the verse which states <i>even Kiryath-arba, which Arba was the father of ‘Anak’ — the same is Hebron</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 15:13.</i> [from which you might deduce that Arba indeed had a son, called Anak, uses the singular as a generic term and] means “the father of Anakim.” Therefore Scripture speaks of [<i>Ahiman, Sheshai and Talmai</i> as <i>the sons of</i>] <i>Anak</i> and as <i>the children ‘ha’anak’</i> (<i>of Anak</i>),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Verse 33 here, Scripture speaks of [<i>the sons of</i>] <i>Anak</i>, and in Verse 22 here [also in Joshua 15:14] of <i>the children of ‘ha’anak.’</i></i> that is, the children of the greatest [giant] of them all [Arba], just as it says, <i>which Arba was the greatest man among the Anakim;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 14:15.</i> and therefore [since it refers to the greatest giant, called Arba, and not to an individual called Anak] Scripture mentions the name with the definite article.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The definite article [indicated in Hebrew by prefixing the word with the letter <i>hei</i>] cannot be prefixed to a proper name of a person.

The reason [for not mentioning them] was because the Land was given to the patriarchs, and it is from them that they were to inherit it, but they rebelled against their ancestors, and did not want the gift which the patriarchs desired very much, so how could he say now, [<i>Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Thy servants,</i>] <i>to whom Thou didst swear by Thine own self, … and all this Land that I have spoken of will I give to your seed</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">126</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 32:13.</i> since they were saying: “We do not want this gift!”<br>Moses [mentioned here the attribute of <i>forgiving iniquity and transgression</i> but he] did not say <i>and sin</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">127</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., of <i>forgiving sin</i>, as well as <i>iniquity and transgression</i>. See the verse in Exodus 34:7, where all three are mentioned: <i>forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin</i>.

In other words, since after G-d said, <i>I have pardoned ‘according to thy word’</i> (Verse 20), He yet continues to state, <i>Surely they shall not see the Land</i> (Verse 23), it follows that Moses’ request, <i>Pardon, I pray Thee</i> (Verse 19) must mean only that G-d be long-suffering to them, but not that they be totally forgiven. Such is the interpretation of Ibn Ezra. Ramban will suggest another explanation of Moses’ request.</i> [is a prayer that G-d be] long-suffering to them [but not that they be totally forgiven]. The same meaning also applies to <i>‘v’nislach lo’</i> (<i>and he shall be pardoned</i>),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">132</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 4:26. Here too the actual offering in itself does not effect atonement until the sinner repents (see Ramban in Vol. III, pp. 21, 54). Hence, says Ibn Ezra, the phrase <i>v’nislach lo</i> means that G-d will be patient and will not punish him until he has had a chance to repent.</i> which implies [that G-d will be long-suffering with him] until he repents sincerely.”<br>The correct interpretation appears to me to be that the term <i>s’lichah</i> means remittance of punishment, as Onkelos rendered it: [<i>s’lach na</i> — “Let go please”]. And the offerings [which one brings for a sin committed in error] remove the punishment for the error from him [the person who brings the offering].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">133</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hence <i>v’nislach lo</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) stated in connection with bringing a sin-offering means that “his punishment will be remitted.”</i> So also, <i>For Thou, Eternal, art good ‘v’salach’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">134</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 86:5. The fact that the word “good” appears before <i>v’salach</i> indicates that the term <i>s’lichah</i> does not merely mean being long-suffering and patient [as Ibn Ezra has it] but expresses a complete remittance of punishment.</i> [means “and are ready to remit punishment”]. And G-d said, <i>‘salachti’ according to thy word</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">129</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 20.</i> meaning [that He has remitted punishment] from the people as a whole, and will not <i>smite them with a pestilence and destroy them</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">135</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 12.</i> <i>and make of</i> Moses <i>a nation greater and mightier than they</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">135</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 12.</i> while they and their seed will perish from the earth; instead, He will pardon them — so that their children [at least] will inherit the Land, and they [themselves] will not die in a plague, for He decreed that their carcasses perish in the wilderness<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">136</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 33.</i> and that each will die when his day comes.<br>Now in the Book of Deuteronomy in mentioning the sin of the golden calf Moses recalled the prayer which He had prayed on their behalf, saying, <i>And I fell down before the Eternal, as at the first</i> etc.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">137</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 9:18.</i> and he explained there what the prayer was, <i>And I prayed unto the Eternal, and said</i> etc.,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">138</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 26.</i> and he also mentioned his prayer on behalf of Aaron. But in [recounting] the affair of the spies he did not mention at all that he had interceded on their behalf. All this is for the reason that I have mentioned, namely, that he did not pray that G-d should forgive them [completely], but rather that He should remit their punishment and be long-suffering with them, and should visit <i>the iniquity of the fathers upon the children</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">122</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 18.</i> Thus his prayer on their behalf was not a complete one [inasmuch as he was not able to intercede for total forgiveness], and therefore [when speaking to the second generation in the Book of Deuteronomy] he did not mention it to them, since they might have complained against him [for not praying for total forgiveness, without realizing that he could not do so because of the greatness of their parents’ sin]."

Ramban, however, does interpret it as part of the oath, which [as he continues to explain], starts at the beginning of Verse 21, and hence there is no need to rearrange the second half of that verse and to place it after Verse 23. See also Note 147.</i> Rather, these verses omit the oath [itself] out of respect to Him Who is on high, [and the meaning thereof is as follows]: “<i>As I live and all the earth shall be filled with</i> My <i>Glory</i> — <i>if</i> all <i>these men</i> who have tested Me <i>shall</i> see the Land, this matter shall not be so!” Similarly, <i>As I live, saith the Eternal … If ye come into the Land</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">140</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verses 28-30.</i> omits the [Divine] oath [meaning: “If they shall come into the Land, it shall not be so!”] Similarly we find verses speaking of a human being which shorten the oath: <i>G-d do so unto me and more also</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">141</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Samuel 3:35.

According to Rashi, however, [see Note 139 above] the oath is completed at the end of Verse 23. Verse 24 promising a reward to Caleb is therefore not part of the oath.

                    "AND WHEN YE SHALL ERR, AND NOT OBSERVE ALL THESE COMMANDMENTS. This section is obscure in meaning, and the commentators of the plain meaning of Scripture<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">183</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A veiled reference to Ibn Ezra, who [in Verse 27] interprets the verse in this way. — But this is obviously not the accepted law. See Vol. III, pp. 11-13, with the respective notes.</i> have mistakenly explained it as referring to an offering which must be brought by one who has unwittingly failed to observe what G-d has commanded him to do. But these words are <i>words of wind</i>!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">184</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 16:3.</i> For if so, there would be an obligation to bring an offering for any of the positive commandments of the Torah, if a person did not fulfill them all and <i>unwittingly</i> [neglected to do] any one of them, and there would [also] be the punishment of excision<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">185</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verses 30-31.</i> for anyone who does not fulfill them all, that is, who neglected <i>knowingly</i> to do [any] one of them, since Scripture states, <i>even all that the Eternal hath commanded him unto you!</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">186</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 23.</i> Moreover, He stated here, <i>And it shall be if it be ‘done’ in error by the congregation</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">187</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 24.</i> [clearly indicating] that the error consists of a [positive] act which they did, and not of sitting back and failing to act! Similarly, <i>But the soul that ‘doeth’ ought with a high hand</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">188</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 30.</i> [which also indicates that the sin consisted of <i>doing</i> something which the Torah prohibited]. But the meaning [of the verse before us] is: “<i>When ye shall err and not observe</i> what G-d has commanded [you to do], but you do the opposite.” Or it [may be that the verse] is stating that [if] “<i>ye shall err and not observe</i> His commandments, namely those things that He has commanded you <i>not</i> to do,” since matters prohibited by a negative commandment are also called “commandments,” just as He said, <i>If any one shall sin through error against any of ‘the commandments’ of the Eternal concerning things which ought not to be done</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">189</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 4:2.</i> Now this offering [mentioned here] which the congregation has to bring when sinning in error is different from the offering mentioned in the section of <i>Vayikra</i>, for there He commanded [the congregation] to bring <i>a bullock for a sin-offering</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">190</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 14.</i> and here He commanded them to bring <i>a bullock for a burnt-offering and a he-goat for a sin-offering</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">191</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 24 here.</i> Therefore our Rabbis had to say that this offering [mentioned here] applies only to worshipping idols in error [and hence has a stricter form of atonement].<br>The language of the verses [here] without being taken out of its simple meaning and implication is [to be understood as if] He were saying: “<i>And when ye shall err</i> in <i>all</i> the commandments, and transgress <i>all</i> that G-d has commanded you <i>by the hand of Moses</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">186</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 23.</i> inasmuch as you will not do <i>anything</i> of that which He has commanded you, then you shall bring this offering.” Therefore He does not mention here, as He does with reference to those offerings [brought] for [committing a particular] sin, <i>‘any of all the commandments’ of the Eternal</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">192</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 4:13.</i> [since the reference here is to transgressing <i>all</i> the commandments, and not just one of them, as is explained further on]. Thus this section according to its plain meaning refers to [the duty of] one who is unwittingly an “apostate” with regard to the entire Torah, [to bring] an offering, such as one who goes and becomes assimilated amongst one of the nations, and behaves as they do and does not want to be part of Israel at all. This applies if it was all done in error, such as — in the case of an individual — a child who was taken into captivity among the nations [and grew up unaware of his Jewish origin], and in the case of the community, if they [mistakenly] thought that the time of the Torah had already passed, and that it was not given for all generations; or if they say — as is mentioned in the Sifre<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">193</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifre, <i>Shelach</i> 115.</i> — “‘Why did G-d give [the Torah]? Was it not so that we should observe it and be rewarded for it? We will not observe it, and will take no reward!’ This is similar to that which the Israelites said and asked of Ezekiel, as it is stated, <i>certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the Eternal and sat before me</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">194</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 20:1.</i> They said to him: ‘Our master Ezekiel: A slave that was sold by his master, does he not go out of his control?’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">195</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The implication is that the Babylonian exile constituted” a sale” to another “master,” and therefore they were released from the authority of the Torah. The answer was given by Isaiah: <i>Thus saith the Eternal: Where is the bill of your mother’s divorcement, wherewith I have put her away? Or which of My creditors is it to whom I have sold you?</i> (50:1). The exile was thus no “sale” of Israel. Instead, it continues to be G-d’s people and duty-bound to keep His commandments.</i> etc.” Or [the section here may refer to a time] when people forget the Torah. This has already happened to us, because of our sins, for in the days of the wicked kings [of the kingdom] of Israel, such as Jeroboam, most of the people forgot the Torah and the commandments completely, as is mentioned [also] — in the Book of Ezra<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">196</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nehemiah 8:14-17. <i>And they found written in the Torah, how that the Eternal had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel dwell in Booths … And all the congregation of them that were come back out of the captivity made Booths, and dwelt in the Booths</i> etc. It is thus clear that the majority of the people had forgotten this commandment. See my Hebrew commentary p. 252, for a further elucidation of this point. It is important to point out that Ramban is referring only to the majority of the ordinary people, but of course even in the dark times of the kingdom of Israel, there were a significant number of individuals, who observed every commandment of the Torah. — [Ramban here calls the Book of Nehemiah “Ezra,” because it was Ezra who wrote it (Baba Bathra 15a). It is generally referred to, as such by many commentators (see e.g., Rashi on Succah 12a)].</i> concerning the people of the Second Temple. This, then, is the purport of our verse, for the “error” mentioned here refers to the totality of the Torah and the commandments. Therefore our Rabbis singled out one commandment, through the unwitting violation of which a person goes out of the community of Israel and all that they have been commanded, namely worshipping idols. The explanation of the verse is thus: “<i>And when ye shall err, to walk after other gods</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">197</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 11:28.</i> <i>and not observe</i> one [particular] thing [which is in itself a denial] of <i>all the commandments</i> of the Eternal;” because one who acknowledges any divinity apart from Him, has already rendered meaningless <i>all</i> that <i>the Glorious Name</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">198</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 28:58.</i> has commanded, whether positive commandments or negative commandments, since if there were to be a deity other than Him, then the [duty of] fearing Him and [keeping] His commandments and all the obligations they entail are of no consequence.<br>This section thus comes to complete the laws of the priests with the law of one who worships idols in error, for this book [of Numbers] completes the laws of the offerings, as I have explained.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">199</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the Introduction to this book, p. 4.</i> It was put in here because the people [after hearing the false report of the spies] rebelled against the word of G-d, and said, <i>Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">200</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 14:4.</i> which means to remain in Egypt as they were originally, without Torah and without the commandments. The section thus comes to inform them that even in the case of idolatry, He forgives those who are in error, but those <i>who do it in a high hand</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">201</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 30.</i> He will cut them off [from among their people].

                    "AND THEY HAVE BROUGHT THEIR OFFERING, AN OFFERING MADE BY FIRE UNTO THE ETERNAL. This refers to the <i>bullock</i> as <i>a burnt-offering</i> mentioned [in the preceding verse]. AND THEIR SIN-OFFERING, which refers to the <i>he-goat for a sin-offering</i> [mentioned there]. Scripture states this on account of the greatness of the sin, involving as it does all the commandments of G-d, and is thereby saying that although the sin was exceedingly grave, since it was in error <i>and they have brought their offerings</i> for it, the burnt-offering and the sin-offering, they are worthy of atonement. And in the Sifre<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">203</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifre, <i>Shelach</i> 111.</i> the Rabbis interpreted this verse on the basis of its [apparent] redundancy: “Rabbi Yashiyah says: If the whole of one tribe [unwittingly] acted [committed idolatry] on the basis of a [mistaken] decision of the [chief] court of that tribe, and the other tribes did so [too, on their word], whence do we know that they [the other tribes] must also bring [these prescribed offerings] on account of them [i.e., the people of the particular tribe who acted according to the decision of its chief court]? Scripture therefore states, <i>‘and they’ have brought their offering, an offering made by fire unto the Eternal</i>. Rabbi Yonathan says etc.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">204</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Yonathan is of the opinion that if the people erred on the basis of the decision of the chief court of a particular tribe, then only the members of that tribe must bring these offerings, but not the other tribes [as is the opinion of Rabbi Yashiyah]. It is only if a wrong decision was [mistakenly] given by the Great Court of seventy-one judges — the supreme court of all Israel — and one tribe acted upon this decision, that all the other tribes must also participate in these offerings, according to Rabbi Yonathan (Malbim <i>ibid.</i>).</i><br>And by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], I have already informed you<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">205</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 20:3; 25:30.</i> that wherever the Tetragrammaton is mentioned it refers to the attribute of mercy, and the expression <i>‘liphnei Hashem’</i> [<i>before the Eternal</i> — as here in the phrase: <i>and their sin-offering ‘before the Eternal’</i>] is like <i>‘al panai’</i> (<i>before Me</i>),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">206</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 20:3. Literally “upon My face.”</i> and this is similar to what the Rabbis of blessed memory have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">207</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Bereshith Rabbah 51:3. See Vol. I, p. 260.</i> “He and His Celestial Court.” Thus the verse is stating that “<i>they have brought their offering</i> to the Proper Name of G-d [i.e., the Tetragrammaton],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">208</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is indicated by the first part of the verse, <i>and they have brought their offering, ‘isheh Lashem’</i> (<i>an offering made by fire to the Eternal</i>) where the Hebrew for <i>the Eternal</i> is the Tetragrammaton. Ramban explained at the beginning of his commentary on this verse that <i>their offering</i> refers to the burnt-offering, which was thus offered to the Tetragrammaton, the Divine Name symbolizing G-d’s attribute of mercy; and the second half of the verse speaks of <i>sin-offering</i> brought <i>l’phanai</i>, i.e., to the Name symbolizing the attribute of judgment. Hence [in the concluding words of Ramban] “the sin is atoned for in the attribute of mercy and in the attribute of judgment.”</i> and <i>their sin-offering ‘l’phanai’</i> (<i>before Me</i>),” and thus the sin is atoned for in the attribute of mercy and in the attribute of judgment. He mentioned this in the case of idolatry [due to the gravity of the sin, because of which they need to be forgiven in both attributes], but in <i>Seder Vayikra</i> where [the sin-offering for violation of] the other commandments is commanded, He mentioned many times <i>‘liphnei Hashem’</i> (<i>before the Eternal</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">209</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 4:4, 6, 7, 15, 17, 24.

On the relationship of the Midrash Tanchuma to Midrash Yelamdeinu, see Volume II, <i>Seder Bo</i>, p. 131, Note 196.</i> <i>Vayikach Korach</i> — he betook himself<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the object of the verb [<i>vayikach</i> — “and he took”] is not mentioned in the verse, Rashi explains that it is reflexive in meaning, referring to Korach himself: “Korach betook himself to one side etc.” Ramban suggests a number of other possible interpretations.</i> to one side in order to separate himself from the [rest of the] congregation so that he could contend for the priesthood [which Moses had conferred upon Aaron and his sons, and Korach claimed that it belonged to all Israel]. This is [also] Onkelos’ intention in translating [the word <i>vayikach</i> as] <i>v’ithpleig</i> — ‘he separated himself’ from the congregation to persist in his contention. Similarly, <i>Why ‘yikachacha’ thy heart?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 15:12. These are the words of Eliphaz the Temanite, when criticizing Job for lack of trust in G-d.</i> means: [Why does your heart] ‘carry you away’ to separate yourself from the rest of the people?”<br>But the opinion of the Midrash [Tanchuma quoted further on] is not in accordance with the Rabbi’s [i.e., Rashi’s] interpretation,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban understood Rashi’s comment as meaning that Korach betook himself <i>physically</i> and left his tent, setting up his quarters outside the camp in order to gather people together to rally to him in his dispute with Moses. In Ramban’s opinion, however, the Midrash clearly means that Korach’s heart stirred him up to revolt (Mizrachi), but not that he betook himself elsewhere physically. See also my Hebrew commentary, pp. 254-255.</i> for the Rabbis have said there: “The term <i>vayikach</i> always denotes ‘division,’ [and here it means] that his heart took control of him, in a similar manner to that which it says, <i>Why ‘yikachacha’ thy heart?</i>”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 15:12. These are the words of Eliphaz the Temanite, when criticizing Job for lack of trust in G-d.</i> The verse thus does not mean to say that Korach betook himself [physically] to one side [of the camp]. Similarly, <i>Why ‘yikachacha’ thy heart?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 15:12. These are the words of Eliphaz the Temanite, when criticizing Job for lack of trust in G-d.</i> does not mean that it [your heart] takes you to one side to separate yourself [physically] from other people. Instead, the meaning of the [interpretation of the] Midrash on [the phrase] <i>Vayikach Korach</i> is that he took counsel in his heart to do that which [Scripture] relates [subsequently], for [the term] “taking” applies also to counsel and thought. Similarly, <i>Why ‘yikachacha’ thy heart?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 15:12. These are the words of Eliphaz the Temanite, when criticizing Job for lack of trust in G-d.</i> means: “What thought does your heart lead you to, that you should be thinking secretly: ‘There is no justice nor Judge,’ and you do not reveal it? Or, <i>and why do thine eyes wink?</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 15:12. These are the words of Eliphaz the Temanite, when criticizing Job for lack of trust in G-d.</i> for one can notice from your winkings that you deny G-d’s justice, but you do not utter [that belief] openly, but [instead] you complain [of injustice], as one who conceals his intent.” Eliphaz said this to Job before Job explained his thoughts in a clearly-expressed statement, [saying] that the Creator’s concern does not extend to the individuals of the lower beings [of each species]. Therefore Eliphaz said to Job: <i>And thou sayest: ‘What doth G-d know? Can He judge through the dark cloud?’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 22:13.</i> This is the true meaning of that reply [of Eliphaz to Job: <i>Why ‘yikachacha’ thy heart? and why do thine eyes wink?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 15:12. These are the words of Eliphaz the Temanite, when criticizing Job for lack of trust in G-d.</i> — as is apparent] to one who considers it carefully. Similarly we find the term “taking” used of “thinking”: <i>‘k’chu’</i> (<i>take</i>) <i>my instruction;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs, 8:10. This clearly cannot refer to taking physically, but means: “think of my instruction and guide your conduct accordingly.”</i> <i>nor ‘kachath’</i> (<i>to take</i>) <i>instruction</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 17:23.</i><br>The Rabbis have further said in the Midrash:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Bamidmar Rabbah 18:13.</i> “Scripture does not state here: And Korach ‘quarelled,’ or ‘spoke,’ or ‘commanded,’ but it says <i>vayikach</i> (<i>and he took</i>). What did he take? He did not take anything; rather, it was his heart that took [control of] him, just as Scripture says, <i>Why doth thy heart take thee?</i>”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 15:12. These are the words of Eliphaz the Temanite, when criticizing Job for lack of trust in G-d.</i> This [Midrash] coincides with what I have explained. And Onkelos who translated: [<i>vayikach</i> as] <i>v’ithpleig</i> (“and he separated himself”) explained the [expression according to its] general meaning, not according to its literal sense, as is his habit in many places. Thus also he translated [the expression] <i>about ‘d’var’</i> (<i>the matter of</i>) <i>Korach</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 17:14.</i> as “about ‘the strife’ of Korach,” while <i>‘bi’dvar’</i> (<i>the matter of</i>) <i>Balaam</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 31:16.</i> he translated as “through ‘the counsel’ of Balaam,” because he mentions the [whole] subject-matter in his translation [rather than the literal meaning, as illustrated by the change in the translation of the word <i>d’var</i> in the above example].<br>And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote: “<i>And Korach took</i> [means he took] ‘men,’ the phrase being elliptical, as in: <i>chamor lechem</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 16:20.</i> [literally: ‘an ass of bread,’ which means: ‘an ass laden with bread’].” Others<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This interpretation I have found in the commentary of Chizkuni. See Genesis, Vol. I p. 298, Note 109, where the same expression “Others” also refers to Chizkuni.</i> explain that [the word] <i>v’dathan</i> (<i>and Dathan</i>) [in the phrase: <i>And Korach took … and Dathan</i>] is like the verse, <i>And these are the children of Zibeon: ‘and’ Ajah, and Anah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 36:24. See Vol. I, p. 440.</i> [where the letter <i>vav</i> in the word <i>v’ayah</i> is redundant, and here too the <i>vav</i> in <i>v’dathan</i> is redundant], and its correct meaning is thus: “<i>and Korach took</i> Dathan and Abiram” [<i>and they rose up before Moses</i>]. But in my opinion there is no need for [these interpretations], for it is quite correct for the [Sacred] Language to say: “and Korach took and Dathan, <i>and they rose</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 2.</i> <i>and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron</i>,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 3.</i> because the [word] “taking” always occurs at the beginning of an event, being an expression of taking action to [do] that deed. Similarly, <i>And Absalom in his lifetime had ‘taken’ and reared up for himself the pillar</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Samuel 18:18.</i> [which means that “he bestirred himself” to set up the pillar]. And if you prefer to explain that the term “taking” refers to the object mentioned subsequently, [so that the verse quoted means]: “and Absalom took the pillar and reared it up for himself in his lifetime” — you may likewise explain [our phrase] “and Korach took” [as referring to] the <i>men of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 2.</i> <i>and they rose up before Moses, and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 3.</i><br>Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote that this incident [of Korach’s rebellion] happened in the wilderness of Sinai when the firstborns were exchanged [for the Levites]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 3:44-51.</i> and the Levites were separated [to do the Divine service in the Tent of Meeting],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 8:5-22.</i> for [some] Israelites thought that Moses our master did this of his own accord so that he could bestow greatness upon his brother [Aaron] and on the children of Kohath who were his relatives,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kohath was Moses’ grandfather. Since Kohath had three other sons beside Amram — namely, Itzhar, Hebron, and Uzziel (above, 3:19) — some people thought that Moses gave the Kohathites special distinction in the Tabernacle service of his own accord (see above, Chapter 4:1-20) because they were his relatives. In actual fact, of course, he did everything by Divine command (see above, 3:40, 4:1 and 8:5).</i> and on all the Levites, since they were of his family. The Levites [nevertheless] joined the conspiracy against him [Moses] because they were <i>given to Aaron and to his sons</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 8:19.</i> and Dathan and Abiram [who were of the tribe of Reuben] joined in the rebellion because Moses took away the right of the firstborn from their ancestor Reuben [and gave it to Joseph].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See (Genesis), Vol. I, pp. 570-572. Here the reference is to the fact that Moses considered Joseph’s sons, Ephraim and Menasheh, as two separate tribes, and Dathan and Abiram claimed that this distinction should have been conferred upon Reuben the firstborn.</i> Korach too was a firstborn.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 6:21 — <i>And the sons of Itzhar: Korach, and Nepheg, and Zichri</i>. — Now before the Tabernacle was set up, the service of the offerings was performed by any of the firstborn in Israel (Zebachim 112b), but afterwards it was performed only by priests. As a firstborn, Korach was thus personally amongst those deprived of his prerogative under the new order established by Moses.</i> [Thus far are Ibn Ezra’s comments.] Now all this is based on the opinion of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra [himself] who has said in many places, as it pleases him, that there is no strict chronological order in the [narrative of the] Torah, but I have already written<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In (Exodus), Vol. II, pp. 252, 419, and in Leviticus 8:2. Here too, Ramban’s objection is that according to Ibn Ezra the rebellion of Korach took place when Israel was still encamped in the wilderness of Sinai although their departure from there has already been recorded long ago (above, 10:12)! Since then there had already been many other stages in their journey through the desert (see e.g. above, 11:35, 12:16)!</i> that in my opinion the whole Torah follows the chronological sequence, except for those places where Scripture [itself] expressly states the “earlier” and the “later,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., if the verses clearly state the dates. See, for example, the section commencing above in Chapter 9, where the date given is clearly <i>before</i> the date of the previous chapters (see Chapter 1, Verse 1).</i> and even then it is [only changed] for a particular purpose and for good reason. But this matter [i.e., the rebellion of Korach] happened <i>in the wilderness of Paran</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 12:16.</i> in <i>Kadesh-barnea</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 1:19. It is from Kadesh-barnea that they sent the spies, as related in the Book of Deuteronomy, <i>ibid.</i></i> after the incident of the spies [and not, as Ibn Ezra wrote, before the sending of the spies].<br>A correct interpretation by way of homiletic exposition is that Korach became angry because of the status of prince [of the Kohathites]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 3:30.</i> bestowed [by Moses] upon Elizaphan, as our Rabbis have said,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Said Korach: “My grandfather Kohath had four sons: Amram, Itzhar, Hebron and Uzziel (Exodus 6:18). The two sons of Amram, the eldest, namely Moses and Aaron, assumed the royalty and the priesthood. Who is entitled to the next rank — the prince of the Kohathites — if not I, the eldest of the second son of Kohath, Itzhar? And yet he [i.e., Moses] went and appointed Elizaphan, whose father was Uzziel, the youngest son of my grandfather!” (Tanchuma <i>Korach</i> 1, mentioned by Rashi).</i> and he was also jealous of Aaron, as it is said, <i>and seek ye the priesthood also!</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 10.</i> Dathan and Abiram [who were of the tribe of Reuben] were attracted to Korach, but not because of the [loss of their] birthright, for it was their father Jacob who had deprived Reuben of it and given it to Joseph;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 48:5.</i> however, they too, voiced their complaint [by saying that Moses had taken the people out of Egypt] <i>to kill us in the wilderness</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 13.</i> and <i>moreover thou hast not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 14.</i> Now as long as Israel was in the wilderness of Sinai no evil happening befell them, for even after the incident of the [golden] calf, which was a serious and well-known sin, those who died [as a punishment] were few, and the people were saved by Moses’ prayer when he <i>fell down before the Eternal the forty days and forty nights</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 9:25.</i> Thus they loved Moses as [they loved] themselves, and they obeyed him, so that had anybody rebelled against Moses at that time, the people would have stoned him. Therefore Korach endured the greatness of Aaron [when he was appointed High Priest], and the firstborns accepted [without protest] the high status of the Levites, and all [the other] acts of Moses. But when they came to <i>the wilderness of Paran</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 12:16.</i> and [some people] were burnt in Taberah,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 11:3.</i> and many died in Kibroth-hattaavah,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 34.</i> and when after sinning [in the matter of] the spies Moses did not pray on their behalf,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ramban above, 14:17 (towards the end) who explains the reason for this.</i> so that the decree against them was thus not annulled, and the princes of all the tribes <i>died by the plague before the Eternal</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 37.</i> and it was decreed that the whole people would be consumed in the wilderness <i>and there they shall die</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 35.</i> then the mood of the whole people became embittered, and they said in their hearts that mishaps occur to them through Moses’ words. Therefore Korach found it an opportune occasion to contest Moses’ deeds, thinking that the people would [readily] listen to him. This was the intention of [the statement of Dathan and Abiram that Moses had taken the people out of Egypt] <i>to kill us in the wilderness</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 13.</i> meaning: “Behold, you have brought us to this place and you have not fulfilled that which you promised to give us, [namely to take us to] <i>a land flowing with milk and honey</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 14.</i> for you have not given us any inheritance at all; instead we will die in the wilderness and be wiped out there, for our children will also never come out of the wilderness, and that which you promised our children will also not be fulfilled, just as it did not come to realization with respect to their parents.” This then was the reason why they murmured particularly at this juncture immediately after the [Divine] decree because of the spies. It is likely that all those who assembled [against Moses] were firstborns, and therefore they were annoyed about the priesthood [which was taken away from them],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Note 22 above.</i> and that is why Moses told them to take censers [and put incense upon them<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verses 6-7.</i> as they used formerly to do, and it would become clear thereby whether G-d preferred them or the priests."

Or it may be, as Ramban continues, that this test took place at the Service of the Morning Whole-offering, which included the burning of incense, so that there is no need to say that Moses resorted to special emergency powers.</i> or maybe it was the [daily] incense of the morning which he used to burn when he kindled<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the Tur: when he “dressed” the lamps.

I have already shown you<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See e.g., Vol. II, pp. 101, 111.</i> that in many places Scripture will sometimes deal at length with the account of G-d’s communication to Moses, but mention [the matter] in brief in Moses’ narration thereof, and at other times it does the opposite. At other instances [still] it does not mention one of the communications at all, such as in the story of the children of Gad and the children of Reuben, where Scripture tells the event [only] with respect to Moses himself [that he gave them the land east of the Jordan as a conditional inheritance], and [this whole matter] was [in fact] done by the commandment of the Eternal, as they said, <i>As the Eternal hath said unto thy servants, so will we do</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">64</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 32:31.</i> And in [the Book of] Joshua it is written, [<i>And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Menasheh returned … to go</i>] <i>unto the land of Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they were possessed, ‘according to the commandment of the Eternal by the hand of Moses’</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 22:9.</i> And if we say that [Moses in fact gave these lands to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Menasheh on his own authority, and the above-mentioned verse which says that it was done <i>according to the commandment of the Eternal</i>] refers to G-d’s [subsequent] agreement to Moses’ action, similar to that which it says, <i>This is the Land wherein ye shall receive inheritance by lot, which the Eternal hath commanded to give unto the nine tribes, and to the half-tribe</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 34:13.

There is a marked difference though between the cases of Moses and those mentioned above. Moses according to tradition acted on his own reasoning, and G-d subsequently approved. In the cases mentioned above [such as in the section about the impure people on Passover, etc.] inquiry was first made for Divine guidance, and it happened that the opinion of those seeking guidance coincided with that on High.</i> — [this cannot be so because] it is not right [to say] that Moses would have done anything in connection with the division of the Land without [Divine] permission.

Moreover, in addition to [being punished for] the census, there was a punishment upon the people [already] at the beginning of this matter, as it is written, <i>And again the anger of the Eternal was kindled against Israel, and He moved David against them</i>, [<i>saying: ‘Go, number Israel and Judah’</i>].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">119</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 1.</i><br>Now Rashi wrote there: “I do not know why [<i>G-d’s anger was kindled against Israel</i>].” And I say by way of explanation that Israel was punished because of the delay in the building of the Sanctuary,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">120</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “The Chosen House,” a reference to the Temple in Jerusalem.

Four hundred years had already passed since the exodus up to that period in the reign of David.</i> <i>as a stranger in the Land</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">122</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 14:8.</i> and none of the tribes bestirred themselves to say, “Let us seek G-d and build a house to His Name, just as it is written, <i>even unto His habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come</i>.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">123</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 12:5.</i> [This situation continued] until David was roused to action in this matter after many years and a long period of time [had elapsed since he had become king], as it is said, <i>And it came to pass, when the king dwelt in his house, and the Eternal had given him rest from all his enemies round about, that the king said unto Nathan the prophet: ‘See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of G-d dwelleth within curtains.’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">124</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Samuel 7:1-2.</i> Now G-d, blessed be He, prevented David [from building the Sanctuary], because He said, <i>for thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in My sight</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">125</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Chronicles 22:8.</i> and thus the building was [further] delayed until the reign of Solomon. But had Israel really desired this matter [and really wanted to build the Sanctuary], and had they bestirred themselves to action from the start, it would have been done [already] in the days of one of the Judges, or in the days of Saul, or even in the days of David. For had the tribes of Israel aroused themselves in this matter, he [David] would not have been [considered] the builder, but Israel would have been the builders. But since the people did not concern themselves about it, and David was the one who was troubled about it and called for action, and it was he who prepared all the materials [for the House of G-d],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">126</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 29:2.</i> he was the builder. However, since he was a man of judgment, guided [in his actions] by the attribute of justice, he was not fit for [the task of building] the House of Mercy,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">127</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To my knowledge, Ramban’s use of this term “the House of Mercy” as an alternative name for the Temple in Jerusalem is the first of its kind in Rabbinic literature. It is of interest to note that a generation later, the French Rabbi Estori Haparchi (1282-1357), in his classic book of itinerary on the Land of Israel, <i>Kaftor Va’ferach</i>, mentions <i>for the first time</i> that one of the gates on the eastern side of the wall surrounding Jerusalem was called by the people <i>Shaarei Harachamim</i> — the “Gates of Mercy” — a name which is still used to this day. Since no definite source is known for the name given to this gate, it is possible that it is derived from this concept of the Sanctuary as “the House of Mercy,” and thus the name “Gates of Mercy” is a shortened form of “the gates of the House of Mercy.” See II Chronicles 23:19 for such usage in the Scriptures: <i>the gates of the House of the Eternal</i>.</i> therefore the building [of the Sanctuary] was delayed as long as David lived due to the negligence of Israel [in not coming forth themselves to build it], and therefore the [Divine] wrath was upon them. It was for this reason that <i>the place which the Eternal shall choose … to put His Name there</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">123</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 12:5.</i> came to be known, as a result of their punishment through the plague.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">128</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In II Samuel, Chapter 24, Verses 16-25 it is related that “<i>the angel of the Eternal was</i>, at the moment that the plague ceased, <i>by the treshing-floor of Aravnah the Jebusite</i>,” and on that spot David built the altar. This is the meaning of Ramban’s statement that <i>‘the place which G-d shall choose’</i> came to be known [i.e., identified] through the punishment and plague which came upon Israel for their indolence in the pursuit of the building of the Sanctuary. But had the people bestirred themselves to action, the place would have been identified through a more pleasant way. This is Ramban’s clear intention.</i><br>Scripture alludes to all this when it says, <i>For I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle. In all places wherein I have walked among all the children of Israel, spoke I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed My people Israel, saying: Why have ye not built Me a house of cedar?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">129</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 7:6-7.</i> Thus Scripture is blaming [the people] because the Divine Presence was walking about among all Israel <i>from tent to tent, and from tabernacle</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">130</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Chronicles 17:5. The continuation here by Ramban [<i>from tent to tent, and from tabernacle</i>] is clearly based on this verse in Chronicles. In II Samuel 7:6 the reading is: <i>in a tent and in a tabernacle</i>.</i> to tabernacle, and there was not one among all the Judges of Israel, who were their shepherds, that bestirred himself in this matter. Scripture also states that G-d too kept distant from them, and did not tell any one of them to build the House, but “now that you [David] have aroused yourself to do it, <i>thou didst well that it was in thy heart</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">131</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Kings 8:18.</i> and I will now command that it should be built by thy son Solomon, who will be a man of peace.”"

But, [continues Ibn Ezra], many countries have already been rent [by earthquakes], and their inhabitants went down alive into the pit. Rather, the meaning of <i>b’riah</i> is ‘cutting off,’ from [the expression] <i>‘u’varei’</i> (<i>and they shall cut</i>) <i>them</i>”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">159</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 23:47.</i> [thus meaning here: “if the Eternal will ‘cut them’ down by causing the ground to open up its mouth etc.”].<br>The correct interpretation is that the term <i>b’riah</i> is [indeed] used [in the sense of] bringing forth something from nothing, for we have no other word in the Sacred Language denoting this concept [<i>creatio ex nihilo</i>] except for this one. The explanation of the matter is that splitting open the [crust of the] earth is [indeed] not a new creation, but that the ground should open up its mouth to swallow up [certain people] is a new event which had never occurred previously. For when the earth is split open, as happens many times during an earthquake which is called <i>zalzalah</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">160</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Arabic word for earthquake.

Rabbi Yosei, Rabbi Yehudah, Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Eliezer the son of Yaakov say: ‘this one was done by Eleazar [the deputy], and all other heifers may be done either by the High Priest or an ordinary priest.’” The purport of this is to tell us that this commandment, because of its profound secret, deserved to be given to the greatest of the priests, and yet it was not given to Aaron [but to Eleazar the deputy]!

See above, <i>Seder Naso</i>, Note 146.</i> Thus the Holy One, blessed be He, treated Aaron also as a prophet in this commandment, and he and Moses our teacher were to give it [the Red Heifer] to Eleazar, who was the greatest of the priests after Aaron, and he was the one who had been anointed with the Oil of Anointment.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 30:30. See also Numbers 3:3: <i>the sons of Aaron, the priests that were anointed</i>. See further Ramban on Leviticus 10:6 (Vol. III, p. 117) where he clearly states that in a certain respect Aaron’s sons were considered like the High Priest because of their anointment during the days of the consecration.</i> This is [therefore] a hint that in subsequent generations the Red Heifer was to be prepared by the greatest of the priests, namely the High Priest. Similarly we have been taught in a Mishnah:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Parah 4:1.</i> “If the Heifer of Purification<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Rashi on Verse 9.</i> was not slaughtered by the High Priest, it is invalid. But Rabbi Yehudah says it is valid.” And in the Gemara of Tractate Yoma [it is stated]:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yoma 42b.</i> “<i>And ye shall give ‘her’ unto Eleazar the priest</i>. ‘Her’ [i.e., this first Red Heifer] you shall give to Eleazar [the deputy High Priest], but in subsequent generations it is not to be given to Eleazar. Some Rabbis say that in subsequent generations it is to be given to an ordinary priest, and some say that in subsequent generations it is to be given [only] to the High Priest.” This [latter statement] is the opinion of the anonymous Mishnah [quoted above, namely that if the Red Heifer was not slaughtered by the High Priest it is invalid], and it is the correct opinion. According to the Sages who are of the opinion that during later generations it may be prepared [even] by an ordinary priest, [the reason why here] Eleazar was commanded to do it is because there was no [ordinary] priest, for it would not be fitting that his younger brother [Ithamar] should take precedence over him [and at that time there were only three priests — Aaron, and his two sons, Eleazar and Ithamar]."

Scripture mentioned this [punishment of] excision without explanation,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., without first saying <i>here</i> that one who is impure may not enter the Sanctuary or Tabernacle.</i> saying, <i>he hath defiled the Tabernacle of the Eternal</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 13. — The Torah there uses the term <i>mishkan</i> (Tabernacle), and the same law applies of course to the <i>mikdash</i> (Sanctuary), mentioned here in Verse 20. Ramban here uses the terms interchangeably; and later on explains why the law is mentioned twice.</i> because He had already warned us against defiling the Sanctuary, just as He said, <i>she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the Sanctuary</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 12:4.</i> For since He mentioned [this prohibition] there in dealing with a lesser degree of impurity, namely, that of a woman after childbirth in the days of her purification, which is a natural event for her, it [is self-understood that it] applies equally to all impure persons. He has also mentioned the [requirement of] immersion [in a ritual pool for purposes of purification], saying, <i>but if he wash them not</i> [i.e., the garments which have become unclean], <i>nor bathe his flesh, then he shall bear his iniquity</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 17:16.</i> that is to say, <i>he will bear his iniquity</i> if he transgresses [the law and does] that which he is admonished not to do [i.e., if he eats holy food or enters the Sanctuary whilst he is still impure, or when he is wearing impure garments]. Therefore He stated here in respect of the impurity [conveyed] by a corpse that <i>whosoever touches the dead</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 13. — The Torah there uses the term <i>mishkan</i> (Tabernacle), and the same law applies of course to the <i>mikdash</i> (Sanctuary), mentioned here in Verse 20. Ramban here uses the terms interchangeably; and later on explains why the law is mentioned twice.</i> <i>and purifieth not himself</i> [with the waters of purification], even though he washes his clothes and bathes himself in water, is [nonetheless] considered one who defiles the Tabernacle, just as if he had not immersed himself [in a ritual pool] at all. Thus it was only necessary to mention that the purification [by means of sprinkling the waters of purification] prevents him from becoming pure [if he did not sprinkle them upon himself, even if he washed his clothes and bathed himself in water], this being the meaning of the expression, <i>his impurity is yet upon him</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 13. — The Torah there uses the term <i>mishkan</i> (Tabernacle), and the same law applies of course to the <i>mikdash</i> (Sanctuary), mentioned here in Verse 20.

There are many such verses. And the meaning of the expression <i>‘ki’ he hath defiled the Sanctuary of the Eternal</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here in Verse 20.</i> is “‘when’ he has defiled the Sanctuary of the Eternal,” [this usage of the word <i>ki</i> being similar to that found in the verse]<i>: ‘ki’ a bird’s nest chance to be before thee</i> [which means: “‘when’ a bird’s nest chance to be before thee”],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 20:6.</i> and [it is like] its many companion-verses.<br>Now Scripture mentions here [the punishment of] excision twice [once in Verse 13 in connection with defiling the Tabernacle, and again in Verse 20 in connection with the Sanctuary]. In the opinion of our Rabbis<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shebuoth 16b.</i> this is in order to declare him liable for defiling the Tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting, and also for the Sanctuary, i.e., the Permanent House [the Temple in Jerusalem].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Vol. II, p. 335, Note 598.</i> According to the plain meaning [of Scripture] it may be that <i>eth mikdash Hashem</i> [usually translated: <i>the Sanctuary of the Eternal</i>] refers to the holy offerings. For He had already declared that he <i>that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which pertain unto the Eternal, having his impurity upon him</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">64</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 7:20.</i> is liable to excision; therefore He now declared furthermore that [in the case of impurity conveyed through a corpse] even if [the impure person] immerses himself [in a ritual pool] he is still liable [to that punishment], if he does not purify himself on the third and seventh day [with the waters of purification, before he eats of the holy offerings]. The meaning, then, of <i>mikdash Hashem</i> [literally: the “Sanctuary” of the Eternal] will be [as if it said]<i>: kod’shei Hashem</i> (the “holy things” of the Eternal), as in the expression <i>eth mik’dsho mimenu</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 18:29.</i> [literally: “the Sanctuary thereof,” which really means: <i>eth kodsho mimenu</i> — “the hallowed part thereof”]. Thus the [punishment of] excision mentioned in [this] section refers to [entering] the Sanctuary [whilst impure, as stated above in Verse 13], and [eating] its hallowed offerings [in such a state, as mentioned in this verse here].<br>The correct interpretation appears to me to be that [implied] by the literal meaning [of Scripture], namely that the first [mention of] excision [in Verse 13] refers to one who [actually] touches the corpse, as He said, <i>Whosoever toucheth the dead, even the body of any man that is dead</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 13.</i> and the second [mention thereof, i.e., in Verse 20 here] applies to those who were rendered impure by <i>ohel</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “a tent.” This refers to the law that anything “spread over” an unclean object has the same effect as “a tent.” Hence if a tree shaded a corpse, the law of a dead body in a house or tent applies.</i> but did not [actually] touch <i>the bone</i> or <i>the grave</i>; for the meaning of [the expression] <i>but the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here in Verse 20.</i> is: “<i>but the man that shall be unclean</i> by any of these means [mentioned in Verses 14-16] <i>and shall not purify himself</i>, [<i>that soul shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly</i>].” By way of the Truth [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], it is possible that the expression <i>mikdash Hashem</i> is alluding to the Sanctuary of the Sanctuary.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">67</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A reference to the Glory of G-d (Abusaula).

                    "WHEN A MAN DIETH IN A TENT. The meaning thereof is: “When a man dies, and he is now [lying] in a tent” [even though he may have died outside the tent and was later on brought in]; or it may be that Scripture speaks about the usual circumstances [and people usually die inside a building], but the same law applies if he died outside and they brought him into the tent. <i>All that come into the tent and all that is in the tent</i> — this includes the vessels therein and the tent itself, as He said [further on], <i>and he shall sprinkle upon the tent and upon all the vessels and upon the persons that were there</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 18.</i> Scripture mentions <i>the tent</i> in order to let us know that the tent itself is rendered unclean for seven days, and [in order to become clean again] requires sprinkling [with the waters of purification]. Furthermore, the Israelites were tent-dwellers in the wilderness and Scripture spoke of the usual [circumstances at that time], because the commandment applied [both] immediately and for later generations; but the same law applies to a house and to everything that “covers” [a corpse], namely that they convey uncleanness to all the vessels and persons that are there, except that a house which is [permanently] attached to the ground cannot itself become impure [unlike a tent which is also defiled].<br>Now Scripture stated [that] a corpse [conveys] impurity by contact<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 16: <i>And whatsoever toucheth … shall be unclean for seven days</i>. — See Vol. III, p. 129, Note 150, on the interchangeable use of the terms “clean,” and “unclean,” or “pure” and “impure.”</i> and by an <i>‘ohel,’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “a tent.” This refers to the law that anything “spread over” an unclean object has the same effect as “a tent.” Hence if a tree shaded a corpse, the law of a dead body in a house or tent applies.</i> but does not mention [that it also conveys impurity to the person who] carries it. Our Rabbis, however, deduced it by a <i>kal vachomer</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “a minor and major.” See Vol. II, p. 133, Note 208 for a fuller explanation of this principle.</i> from [the law of] a dead animal,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“If a dead animal, which only renders one impure until [the same] evening, and does not convey impurity by <i>ohel</i> (see Note 32), nonetheless does convey impurity [to one who] carries it — surely a corpse [which conveys impurity for <i>seven</i> days, and also by <i>ohel</i>, conveys impurity to one who carries it]! And just as in the case of a dead animal, touching it conveys impurity until the [same] evening and carrying it [likewise] conveys impurity until the evening, so also in the case of a corpse, where touching conveys impurity for seven days, carrying also conveys impurity for seven days” (Rambam, Mishneh Torah, <i>Hilchoth Tumath Hameith</i>, 1:2).</i> and have included it in [the law of] uncleanness of seven days, just like [one who] touches [a corpse]. This is also in accordance with the plain meaning of Scripture, for He mentioned in the case of one who dies [of his own accord] or was killed that he who touches him becomes unclean for seven days,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 16: <i>And whatsoever toucheth … shall be unclean for seven days</i>. — See Vol. III, p. 129, Note 150, on the interchangeable use of the terms “clean,” and “unclean,” or “pure” and “impure.”</i> and [requires] sprinkling [with the waters of purification]; and it is already known that [the word] “touching” in the Torah refers to actual personal contact, and to contact through another object, that is, by carrying it [in which case he is “touching” the object carried by means of the intervening object]."

And the plain meaning [of the verse] is: <i>in the open field</i> where there are no tents, a corpse conveys uncleanness [only] by contact.” This is Rashi’s language. But in the opinion of the Sages<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reference here is to Rabbi Yishmael, whose opinion on this matter is, according to Ramban, the accepted decision of the law. Rashi’s comment, however, follows the opinion of Rabbi Akiba (Chullin 72a) who does derive the principle of the upper board and the side board of the coffin from the verse before us (Mizrachi).</i> the [law that the] upper and side boards of the coffin [convey uncleanness] is not derived from Scripture, but is a tradition [handed down by Moses who received it at Sinai]. Therefore a Nazirite [who has become impure by coming into contact with them] is not subject to [the law of] shaving his hair,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See above, 6:9. In other words, since this impurity is not derived from a Scriptural verse, although it is in fact a law of the Torah and not merely of the Rabbis, the Nazirite is not considered as having defiled himself to the extent that he must start his period as a Nazir anew.</i> and likewise [one who becomes impure through contact with them] is not liable to punishment for defiling the Sanctuary [by entering it when impure] or [by eating] the hallowed offerings [in such a state of uncleanness]. Rather, [the expression] <i>in the open field</i> is to be understood according to our Rabbis in its literal sense, i.e., that he touches a person who is slain by the sword, who has fallen <i>in the open field</i>, and there is nothing covering over the corpse. And since this verse is now [seemingly] superfluous, [since it has already been stated in Verse 11 above that one who touches a corpse becomes impure], the Rabbis derived from it the following interpretation, and they said in Tractate Nazir in the Chapter “The High Priest:”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nazir 53b.</i> “<i>And whosoever toucheth in the open field</i>. This refers to one who ‘covers over’ a corpse” [and tells us that he becomes impure], since by covering over it he “touches” <i>the open field</i>. [According to this interpretation of the Rabbis the expression] <i>bachalal cherev</i> (<i>slain by the sword</i>) is lacking the [connective letter] <i>vav — u’bachalal cherev</i>, [meaning: “or slain by the sword”].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus according to the interpretation of the Rabbis, two separate principles are enunciated in this verse: 1) <i>and whosoever ‘touches’ upon the face of the field</i>, i.e., who leans over a corpse or covers it with his body, because in doing so he “touches” the corpse; 2) or <i>whosoever touches</i> directly <i>one slain by the sword</i>.</i> And since Scripture says <i>‘pnei’ hasadeh</i> [literally: “the face” of the field] and does not [just] say “the field”, Rabbi Yishmael further interpreted it<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chullin 72a.</i> to exclude the [case of a] foetus which died whilst still in its mother’s womb [so that if the midwife put her hand inside the mother and touched it, she does not become impure], because it is impurity which is “swallowed up,” and is not “upon the face” of the place.<br>Scripture states <i>slain ‘by the sword’</i> because it speaks of the usual [way of events], but the same law applies if the person was slain by a stone or fist. It mentions those killed and those who die [naturally, stating: <i>one that is slain by the sword, or one that dieth of himself</i>] in contrast to animals for [those animals, which are permitted as food] are pure if they are slaughtered properly, but if they die of their own accord [or were not slaughtered properly] convey impurity as carrion; whereas <i>all</i> human corpses convey impurity, regardless of how the person met his death]. Since it appears superfluous, however, our Rabbis interpreted it in the following manner, namely [that the expression <i>one that is slain by the sword</i> is intended to teach us] that the sword [with which the person was slain] is exactly like the slain person himself, and the whole purpose of the verse is to equate the slain and the sword, so as to say that it [the sword] becomes an <i>avi avoth hatumah</i> (a progenitor of a primary source of impurity),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the process of conveying impurity from one source to another, the general rule is always that the defilement of the recipient is of a lesser degree than that of the conveyor. But here in the case of a dead body there is a point of novelty. Since the corpse itself is considered an <i>‘avi’ avoth hatumah</i> (<i>a progenitor</i> of a primary source of impurity) the sword which touched him should have become only an <i>av hatumah</i> (a primary source of impurity), while the rule is that it becomes an <i>avi avoth hatumah</i> just like the dead itself. Hence a person that touches the sword which was so defiled becomes an <i>av hatumah</i> (a primary source of impurity), and not a <i>rishon l’tumah</i> (a first degree of impurity) as would be the ordinary rule. See further on these laws in Vol. III, p. 148, Note 252. It should also be pointed out [for the sake of the following text of Ramban] that the above principle of the sword [becoming an <i>avi avoth hatumah</i> just as the corpse] applies also to all metal vessels which have been rendered impure by a corpse.</i> just like the dead person himself, and it conveys impurity of seven days’ duration to people and vessels. It appears from the text of the Mishnah and Gemara<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ramban in his commentary to Baba Bathra 20a where he discusses at length these “texts of the Mishnah and Gemara” which corroborate his opinion. It is of interest to note that Ramban cites there also the varying opinion of Rabbeinu Tam [the outstanding authority among the masters of the Tosafoth] who holds that the sword is equated entirely to a corpse, even in regard to the impurity of <i>ohel</i> (see Note 32 above). — For the term <i>Gemara</i> see in Vol. II p. 132, Note 204.</i> that it [the sword and all metal vessels] convey impurity by contact and through carrying just like the corpse, but it is unlike the corpse in [that it does not] convey impurity by <i>ohel</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “a tent.” This refers to the law that anything “spread over” an unclean object has the same effect as “a tent.” Hence if a tree shaded a corpse, the law of a dead body in a house or tent applies.</i> [i.e., if it is in a tent or building together with a person or object, that person or object remains pure]. Perhaps the Rabbis based this exclusion on the verse dealing with the tent, which says: <i>when ‘a man’ dieth in a tent</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 14.</i> [thus implying that the law of “the tent,” i.e., that of conveying impurity by <i>ohel</i>], applies only to the dead body itself. And if a sword [or metal vessel] which became impure by [touching] a corpse were to convey impurity of <i>ohel</i>, the priests would be forbidden to enter all buildings [even after the removal of the corpse], for they all have a “sword” [i.e., some metal vessel]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Note 40 above.</i> which has become impure, and it would defile them by <i>ohel</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “a tent.” This refers to the law that anything “spread over” an unclean object has the same effect as “a tent.” Hence if a tree shaded a corpse, the law of a dead body in a house or tent applies.</i> [and it is obviously impossible to say that priests may never enter all buildings]!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This problem was proposed by Rabbeinu Chayim Hakohen to Rabbeinu Tam: “If so, what house would you build for them [the priests], and what place may be their resting place?” (see my Hebrew commentary p. 270).</i> It further appears in the Gemara<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nazir 54b.

The fact, that in this verse which speaks of the sprinkling of the waters of purification upon the impure, it does not mention that he became defiled by having touched “one that is slain with a sword,” indicates that he is rendered impure for a seven days’ duration, yet he does not require the sprinkling of the waters mentioned.</i> it says, <i>and upon him that touched the bone, or ‘the slain,’ or the dead or the grave</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 18.

But this is not correct, since Israel turned away from him [Edom]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 21.</i> and did not wage battle with them at all.<br>The correct interpretation appears to me to be that it is the Scriptural style to mention [“the whole congregation”] when speaking of complaints, [just as in the following verses]<i>: And all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 16:1. See <i>ibid.</i>, Verses 2-3, that they murmured for food.</i> <i>And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, by their stages … and encamped in Rephidim</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">72</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 17:1. There too it is related in Verses 2-3 that they quarrelled with Moses, saying, “Give us water.”</i> — and Scripture thereby informs us that they all [participated] in the complaint. Similarly, <i>And all the congregation lifted up their voice;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">73</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 14:1. In that case they were discouraged by the report of the spies, and wanted to return to Egypt.</i> <i>And on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">74</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i> 17:6. There they complained about the death of Korach and his followers.</i> Scripture uses that expression when they came to Mount Hor<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">75</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 22.</i> in order to tell us that they all took part in the mourning for Aaron, <i>the holy one of the Eternal</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">76</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 106:16.</i> just as it is said, <i>and they wept for Aaron … all the house of Israel</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">77</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 29.</i> and it states [furthermore]<i>: in the sight of all the congregation</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">78</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 27.</i> In Bamidbar Sinai Rabbah<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">79</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Bamidbar Rabbah 19:9.</i> I have seen mentioned the text [quoted above by Rashi] — “an upright congregation etc.” — only in connection with the second verse [speaking] about Mount Hor [i.e., Verses 20 and 27 quoted above, which say that <i>‘the whole congregation came’</i> to Mount Hor, and that Moses and Aaron <i>went up into Mount Hor ‘in the sight of all the congregation’</i>], for in the case of the first verse [i.e., the present verse, the expression <i>all the congregation</i>] is used because [Scripture wants to indicate that they all joined in] the murmuring, as I have explained.",

I.e., the verses do not state explicitly what constituted the sin of Moses and Aaron, but it was clearly considered a grave one. Ramban proceeds to discuss various explanations at length.</i> is not clearly expressed in Scripture. Rashi explains<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">84</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verses 11-12.</i> that [their sin consisted of hitting the rock], because He had commanded them, <i>and speak ye unto the rock</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">85</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 8.</i> and did not say “and ye shall strike it.” For had they spoken [to the rock and it had brought forth water] the Holy One, blessed be He, would have been sanctified before the whole congregation, since the people would have said: “If [even] this rock, which does not hear and does not speak, nonetheless obeys the command of the Holy One, blessed be He, how much more so should we [obey His commands]!” These words are [in the nature of] a homiletic interpretation,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">86</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Found in Midrash Agadah, here on Verse 8. — In other words, Ramban does not question the homiletic truth of this interpretation, for it is surely conducive to gaining the proper awe for the word of G-d. But it does not clarify the matter of the verses.</i> but they do not clarify [the matter]. For since G-d had commanded Moses: <i>Take the rod</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">85</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 8.</i> it implied that he <i>should</i> smite [the rock] with it, for had He only wanted that he should speak to it, what was [the point of] this rod in his hand? Similarly, in the [case of the] plagues of Egypt where He said, <i>and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thy hand</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">87</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 7:15.</i> it was in order to smite with it;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">88</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 17: <i>I will smite with the rod that is in my hand upon the waters which are in the river</i>.</i> and sometimes He said, <i>Stretch forth thy hand</i> [<i>with thy rod</i>],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">89</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 8:1.</i> when the meaning is: “to smite with the rod,” since Scripture writes briefly when the subject-matter is self-understood. Moreover, the miracle [involved in the rock giving forth water] is no greater if [accomplished] by speech than by smiting, for as far as the rock is concerned both are equal. Furthermore [if the sin consisted of smiting the rock], why did He say about this: <i>ye</i> [Moses and Aaron] <i>trespassed against Me?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">90</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 32:51.</i> [It cannot be because they failed to <i>speak</i> to the rock], for the [fulfillment of the] command to [Moses to] <i>speak</i> to the rock is indeed [also] mentioned at the occurrence [of the event]! Thus He commanded [Moses and Aaron] to say whilst the rock “listens” that G-d will bring forth water out of this rock, similar to [that which Joshua said about a stone which he put up as a witness to the covenant which he made with the people], <i>for ‘it hath heard’ all the words of the Eternal</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">91</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 24:27.</i> And they [Moses and Aaron] indeed did so, as Scripture states, <i>And Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock, and he said unto them</i> etc.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">92</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 10. Thus it is obvious that Moses did utter the Divine message whilst the rock “listened.” And so why did Rashi attribute to Moses the lack of speaking in this event!</i> Thus the rock did “hear” when he [Moses] spoke these words to all the people!<br>Now Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra has already refuted many claims of the commentators in [their explanations of the nature of] this sin. But the secret<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">93</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ibn Ezra alludes to the Cabalistic concept that when a person’s mind cleaves solely to G-d, he can accomplish miracles. Now G-d told Moses to speak to the rock, and had he done so with single-minded devotion to G-d, he would have been able thereby to bring forth water. But when he began rebuking the people for their complaints, he lost that complete concentration of mind which was required for invoking G-d’s miraculous intervention to bring forth water, and he then proceeded to smite the rock. When this failed to produce any water, he smote it a second time, by which time he had regained his original complete concentration of mind on G-d, so that the water then came forth. Ramban rejects this interpretation.</i> to which he alluded is also incorrect. For if Moses lost his concentration of mind because of the strife of the people, and [therefore] did not speak to the rock, so that the water did not come forth [when he smote the rock] the first time, and only when he hit the rock again, a second time, with concentration of cleaving unto [the Creator of] all, did the water come forth [as Ibn Ezra explains] — then they [indeed] sinned the first time, but it was not such [a sin] about which He would say: <i>ye believed not in Me, to sanctify Me</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">94</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 12.</i> since there was no lack of “faith” here at all!<br>Now Rabbeinu Rabbi Moshe [ben Maimon] advanced the following reasoning,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">95</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his <i>Shemonah Perakim</i> (The Eight Chapters), Chapter 4. These chapters are Maimonides’ introduction to the Tractate Aboth, which contains the roots of ethical and moral teachings of the Rabbis of the Mishnah.</i> and explained “that the sin of Moses our teacher, of blessed memory, consisted of tending towards anger, when he said, <i>Hear now ye rebels</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 10.</i> and G-d, blessed be He, treated this as a failing, that a man like him should show anger in front of the congregation of Israel, in a situation in which anger was not warranted. All similar actions of such a man are treated as a profanation of G-d’s Name, because the people take an example from all his [Moses’] movements and words, hoping thereby to achieve successes<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">97</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In our “Shemonah Perakim” it is in the singular: “success.” The word is here indicative of achievement of those qualities of character which make one’s life “a success” in the noblest sense of the word.</i> in this world and the World to Come. How could he [permit himself to] appear angry, since it [anger] is an evil trait, and is derived only from a bad characteristic of the features of the soul! But when He said of this sin: <i>ye trespassed against Me</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">90</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 32:51.</i> [the meaning thereof] is as I shall explain. Moses was not speaking to simpletons, nor to those of insignificant status, for the least important of their women was [equal in prophetic vision] to [the prophet] Ezekiel the son of Buzi, as the Sages have mentioned.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">98</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“A maidservant saw at the [splitting of the Red] Sea what the prophet Ezekiel never saw” (Mechilta, Exodus 15:25). See Vol. II, p. 228.</i> Thus whatever Moses said or did the people would examine, so that when they saw him becoming angry, they said that he — may his memory be blessed — did not lack moral perfection, and therefore ‘unless he knew that G-d was angry with us for demanding water, and that we have aroused His anger, blessed be He, Moses also would not have been angry with us.’ But we do not find that G-d, praised be He, was angry [with the people] when He spoke to Moses on this matter. But [instead] He said: <i>Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes, that it give forth its water; and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock; so thou shalt give the congregation and their cattle drink</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">85</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 8.</i> [This statement does not indicate that G-d was angry with the people for having demanded water, and hence Moses’ anger was unjustified.] Thus we have solved one of the most difficult problems in the Torah, concerning which many things have been said, and which has been asked many times, namely: ‘what was the sin which Moses committed?’ Consider what has been said [by others] about it, and what we ourselves have explained, and let the truth prevail.” These are the words of Rabbi Moshe [ben Maimon] of blessed memory.<br>He has added <i>vanity</i> upon <i>vanities</i>!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">99</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ecclesiastes 1:2. — In other words, yet another interpretation has been added to those of the previous commentators which are not satisfactory.</i> For Scripture says <i>ye trespassed against Me</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">90</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 32:51.</i> meaning that they transgressed His command, and He [further] stated, <i>ye believed not in Me</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">94</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 12.</i> meaning that they lacked faith in Him, [and if so] the punishment [of Moses] was not because he showed anger! [Were this to be his sin], Moses would have deserved punishment [not so much here as] when he <i>was wroth with the officers of the host</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">100</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 31:14.</i> for no reason. Moreover, Scripture [here] does not mention anything about him being angry, for the expression <i>Hear now, ye rebels</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 10.</i> is [merely a form of] rebuke, similar to that which he [Moses] said: <i>Ye have been rebellious against the Eternal</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">101</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 9:24.</i> Furthermore, Aaron never in his life became angry, for he always <i>walked in peace and uprightness</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">102</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Malachi 2:6. — Yet Verse 12 clearly states that Aaron too, was to be punished, although according to Rambam’s explanation he had not sinned!</i> Besides, it is impossible [to suggest, as Rambam does], that G-d was not very angry with them [the people] for their strife with Moses! For throughout all their [previous] trials in the wilderness, their greatest sin was when they said, <i>wherefore hast thou brought us up out of Egypt?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">103</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 17:3.</i> and they preferred to be slaves to their enemies doing rigorous work, rather than to be G-d’s [people], like a son who serves his father. Thus Scripture says: <i>because that ye have rejected the Eternal Who is among you, and have troubled Him with weeping, saying: ‘Why, now, came we forth out of Egypt?’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">104</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 11:20.</i> On the first occasion they said even less than this, [namely], <i>Wherefore hast thou brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">103</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 17:3.</i> and yet there was great [Divine] wrath against them, and [it was considered] a great sin, just as it is said, <i>And the name of the place was called Massah</i> [Trying] <i>and Meribah</i> [Strife], <i>because of the striving of the children of Israel</i> etc.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">105</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 17:7.</i> And here it says expressly, <i>These are the waters of Meribah</i> [Strife], <i>where the children of Israel strove with the Eternal!</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">106</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 13. Thus Scripture here emphasizes that the people’s sin consisted of <i>striving with the Eternal</i>, and this is not so according to Maimonides’ explanation, as Ramban continues.</i> What greater transgression can there be than this! <i>Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker!</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">107</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 45:9.</i> And Moses said, <i>Also the Eternal was angry with me for your sakes, saying: ‘Thou also shalt not go in thither.’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">108</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 1:37.</i> If so, it was they [the people] who sinned and brought about all this misfortune! But according to the explanation of the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon], they did not commit any transgression and sin at all in this whole affair! And as for that which Rabbi Moshe said: “We do not find that G-d, praised be He, was angry [with the people when He spoke to Moses on this matter], but instead He said: <i>Take the rod</i> etc.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">86</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Found in Midrash Agadah, here on Verse 8. — In other words, Ramban does not question the homiletic truth of this interpretation, for it is surely conducive to gaining the proper awe for the word of G-d.

But [it is only] when they complained for no [good] reason, that <i>He poured upon</i> them <i>the fury of His anger</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">115</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 42:25.</i> And here there is an additional allusion to great wrath, and [the people] being liable to a plague, as it is said, <i>and the glory of the Eternal appeared unto them</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">116</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 6.</i> [The expression <i>unto them</i>] refers to <i>the assembly</i> mentioned [in the first part of the verse], which indicates “the hand of the Eternal” that is present in plagues, as you may note in [incidents of] the spies,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">117</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 14:10-12: <i>and the glory of the Eternal appeared … ‘I will smite them with the pestilence.’</i></i> the day of Korach’s punishment,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">118</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 16:19: <i>and the glory of the Eternal appeared</i> … The destruction of Korach and his company followed, as related <i>ibid.</i>, (Verses 31-33).</i> and the following day.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">119</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 17:7: <i>and the glory of the Eternal appeared</i> … This was followed by a plague, as related there in Verses 11-14.</i> And one must [moreover] wonder at the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon, who wrote that the people committed no sin in this affair] since the verse explicitly states, <i>They angered Him also at the waters of Meribah, and it went ill with Moses because of them!</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">120</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 106:32. — See my Hebrew commentary, pp. 274-276 for various defenses of Rambam’s interpretation of Moses’ sin at Meribah. In his Sefer Hazikaron (see Vol. I, Preface pp. x-xi) Rabbi Yom Tov ben Abraham (Ritba) concludes his defense of Rambam’s opinion as follows: “And although I know that the tradition of our master, Rabbi Moshe ben Nachman (Ramban) of blessed memory, in the matter of Moses’ sin is the true tradition which one cannot criticize, yet there are seventy [different] interpretations of the Torah, and they are all the words of the living G-d.” Ramban’s own explanation follows now in the text.</i> And the verse [there] counts this sin amongst the great trials with which they [the people] tested G-d in the wilderness!<br>The most likely explanation amongst all those that have been said about this matter, and the one best suited to answer a questioner, is that of Rabbeinu Chananel,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">121</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See above, <i>Seder Korach</i>, Note 48.</i> who wrote [in his commentary] that the sin consisted of their saying, <i>are ‘we’ to bring you forth water out of this rock?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 10.</i> They should [not have said “are we”, but] “shall the Eternal bring you forth water?” just as they had said <i>when ‘the Eternal shall give’ you in the evening flesh to eat</i> etc.,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">122</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 16:8.</i> and similarly in [the case of all the] miracles they [Moses and Aaron] informed them that the Eternal would do wonders for them. And [since they did not say so here], perhaps the people thought that Moses and Aaron brought forth the water for them out of the rock through their own wisdom [and that it was not a Divine miracle]. This is [what G-d referred to in saying], <i>ye sanctified Me not</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">123</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 32:51.</i> Now in the case of the first episode with the rock, He said, <i>Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">124</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 17:6.</i> and the seventy elders saw the pillar of the cloud<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">125</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 13:21.</i> hovering over the rock, and thus it was made apparent to all that the miracle was the deed of the Great G-d. But here, since the people saw nothing, they misunderstood the words of Moses and Aaron [as explained above].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">126</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the comments of later scholars on Rabbeinu Chananel’s explanation of this topic, quoted in my edition of Rabbeinu Chananel al Hatorah (Mosad Harav Kook, Jerusalem, 5732).</i><br>It is possible that He said <i>‘m’altem bi’</i> (<i>ye ‘trespassed’ against Me</i>),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">123</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 32:51.</i> because if one derives benefit from a sacred object, it is called <i>me’ilah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">127</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here too, a deed which was in reality a Divine miracle came to be ascribed to Moses’ and Aaron’s own doing, as explained above, because they said, <i>are ‘we’ to bring you forth water out of this rock</i>? In a way, then, Moses and Aaron thereby “derived benefit” from a sanctified matter.</i> Similarly, He said <i>‘m’rithem pi’</i> (<i>ye rebelled against My commandment</i>)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">128</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 27:14.</i> because He had commanded them to <i>speak unto the rock before their eyes</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">129</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 8.</i> in order that I should become sanctified in their eyes. Or [it may be that <i>m’rithem pi</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">128</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 27:14.</i> means] “you have ‘changed’ My commandment,” related to the expression <i>‘vatemer’</i> (<i>and she changed</i>) <i>My ordinances</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">130</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 5:6.</i> since I did not command you to speak in this manner [<i>are ‘we’ to bring you forth water out of this rock?</i>]. And [according to Rabbeinu Chananel’s explanation, the criticism that] <i>lo he’emantem bi</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">131</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 12.</i> (<i>ye believed not in Me</i>) refers [not to Moses and Aaron <i>themselves</i> lacking in belief, but] to the children of Israel [i.e., it does not mean, as it is generally translated, “ye believed not in Me,” but “‘ye did not cause the children of Israel to believe in Me’ because you did not attribute to Me the bringing forth of the water from the rock”]. Or [the word <i>he’emantem</i>] may mean “strengthening,” as if to say: “you did not strengthen yourselves to sanctify Me in their eyes,” related to these expressions: <i>‘va’amanah’</i> (<i>and a ‘sure’ ordinance</i>) <i>concerning the singers;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">132</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nehemiah 11:23. Meaning: “a strong” ordinance.</i> <i>the peg that was fastened ‘bimkom ne’eman’</i> (<i>in a ‘sure’ place</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">133</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 22:25. Meaning “a strong” place.</i><br>The Truth [Cabalistic explanation] is that this subject [i.e., the nature of Moses’ sin in the incident of the waters of Meribah] is one of the great secrets amongst the mysteries of the Torah. For on the first [occasion with the rock] He said to Moses, <i>Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">124</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 17:6.</i> meaning to say: “My Great Name will be upon the rock in Horeb,” which is <i>the Glory of the Eternal</i>, the <i>devouring fire on the top of the mount</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">134</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 24:17. The verse reads: <i>‘like’ devouring fire</i>.</i> Therefore he only hit it there once, and a great amount of water came forth. But here He did not tell him so, and so both of them [Moses and Aaron] agreed that they would smite the rock twice — and that was their sin.

See my Hebrew commentary p. 276.</i> that by faith [alone] the miracle will be done.” It states, <i>‘m’rithem pi’</i> (<i>ye rebelled against My commandment</i>),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">128</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 27:14.</i> because <i>they rebelled</i> against <i>His holy spirit</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">136</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Isaiah 63:10.</i> which is always called <i>pi Hashem</i> (<i>the commandment of the Eternal</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">137</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ramban above, 10:6.</i> Therefore He said, <i>‘m’altem’ bi</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">123</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 32:51.</i> and the term <i>me’ilah</i> always denotes “untruth.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">138</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In this case the “untruth” consisted of thinking that there would be no water unless they would hit the rock twice (Abusaula).</i> Thus the sin [of Moses and Aaron] is clearly expressed in Scripture. And so did the Psalmist say, [<i>Tremble thou earth</i> …] <i>at the presence of the G-d of Jacob; Who turneth the rock into a pool of water</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">139</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 114:7-8.</i> And you can understand this from Moses’ prayer, when he said, <i>O G-d Eternal, Thou hast begun</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">140</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 3:24.</i> pleading before <i>the Glorious Name</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">141</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 28:58.</i> to forgive him.<br>And in the opinion of our Rabbis<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">142</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifre, <i>Matoth</i> 157.</i> who mention Moses’ anger [as a factor in his sin], it is possible that he hit the rock but [only] a few drops came forth as a result of the diminution in his concentration because of his anger, and they both [Moses and Aaron] were astonished at this, and decided to hit the rock a second time, as I have mentioned, and that was the sin of both of them.<br>In my opinion, the meaning of the phrase, <i>and speak ye ‘el’</i> (<i>unto</i>) <i>the rock</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">129</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 8.</i> is like <i>‘al’</i> (concerning) the rock. Similarly, <i>Thus saith the Eternal of hosts ‘el’ the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases … they shall be carried unto Babylon</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">143</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 27:19; 22. The verse clearly does not mean “unto the pillars,” but “concerning the pillars.”</i> Thus He commanded them [Moses and Aaron] to say in the presence of the congregation, when they are all gathered together, that G-d will bring them forth water out of the rock, as He indeed did. Now do not find a difficulty<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">144</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The difficulty is as follows: If we explain [as we have done hitherto] that <i>speak ye ‘el’ the rock</i> means “to” the rock, and <i>the rock</i> will listen, then the following word <i>l’eineihem</i> (<i>before their eyes</i>) fits in perfectly. The speaking by Moses and Aaron with the rock listening, is to be done before “the eyes” of the people. But if as we now explain <i>speak ye ‘el’ the rock</i> as meaning <i>‘al’ the rock</i> [“concerning” the rock] while <i>the people</i> are to listen, how is the word <i>l’eineihem</i> in accord with the thought, since people do not listen with “their eyes?” Hence Ramban proceeds to remove this difficulty by pointing out that the word <i>l’eineihem</i> is Scripturally not always used in a literal sense and here it means “in their presence.”</i> in the verse, <i>and ‘speak’ ye unto the rock ‘before their eyes,’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">129</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 8.</i> for the meaning thereof is like “in their presence”, so that they should all hear it. Similarly [we find]: <i>And Hananiah ‘spoke before the eyes of’</i> [which means: “in the presence of”] <i>all the people, saying:</i> ‘<i>Thus saith the Eternal: Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon</i> etc.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">145</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 28:11.</i> There are many cases like this. Or the meaning of the word <i>l’eineihem</i> (<i>before their eyes</i>) here may be that [Moses’] speaking [to the rock] should be when the people are all gathered there, and the rock is <i>before their eyes</i>, as it says when the event [actually took place], <i>And Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together ‘before the rock’</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 10.</i> For when they had gathered together there and saw the rock face to face, they [Moses and Aaron] said, <i>are we to bring you forth water out of this rock?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 10.</i> — as the Sages have mentioned<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">146</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tanchuma, <i>Chukath</i> 6.</i> — so that they should not say that there were springs [hidden at that place]. It is possible that the verse is to be [interpreted] as if it were transposed, meaning: “assemble the congregation unto the rock, and speak ye before their eyes, that it give forth water.”",
                    "THAT IT GIVE FORTH ITS WATER. The meaning thereof is that a large amount of water should immediately spring forth, just as it is said, <i>and water came forth abundantly</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">147</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 11.</i> for the term “giving” denotes abundance, as in [the verses]: <i>and the Land shall ‘give’ her produce, and the trees of the field shall ‘give’ their fruit;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">148</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 26:4.</i> <i>For as the seed of peace, the vine shall ‘give’ her fruit, and the Land shall ‘give’ her increase, and the heavens shall ‘give’ their dew</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">149</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zechariah 8:12.</i> In all these [verses] He was promising them abundance. And so, it is written, [<i>Behold, He smote the rock, that waters gushed out</i>], <i>and streams overflowed</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">150</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 78:20.</i> Now the meaning of <i>‘its’ water</i> [<i>that it give forth ‘its’ water</i>] is not like [<i>the Land</i>] <i>shall give ‘her’ produce</i>, and [<i>the trees</i>] <i>shall give ‘their’ fruit</i>, since it is not in the nature of a rock to have water in it. But its meaning is [that it will give forth] the water which will come out of it, for when G-d turns <i>the flint into a fountain of waters</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">151</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 114:8.</i> so that they are [contained] in it and come forth out of it, the waters may [indeed] be called <i>‘its’ water</i>. Similarly, <i>and He will bless ‘thy’ bread, and ‘thy’ water;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">152</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 23:25.</i> <i>‘his’ bread shall be given, ‘his’ waters shall be sure</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">153</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 33:16.</i> He stated it in this way [<i>that it give forth ‘its’ water</i>] in order to inform us that the waters will come forth from the very rock itself, not from the ground beneath it, as occurs naturally in the case of many fountains; but [these waters] will come forth from the middle of the rock. And so it is written, <i>Who turneth the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a fountain of waters</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">151</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 114:8.</i> He repeated a second time [in this verse], <i>and thou shalt bring forth to them water</i>, meaning that “while you [Moses] are still there, you should bring them forth water from the rock, so that they should all see it gushing forth.” SO THOU SHALT GIVE THE CONGREGATION AND THEIR CATTLE DRINK. [This means] that “you should command them to drink from it in your presence.” All this was for the purpose of publicizing the miracle. In the actual event, [however], it is not mentioned that “he gave the congregation and their cattle to drink;” instead, it says, <i>and the congregation drank, and their cattle</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">147</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 11.</i> because owing to their great thirst, as soon as they saw water gushing out in abundance, they fell upon the river and drank.<br>Now according to the opinion of our Rabbis about Miriam’s Well,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">154</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This was a moving well in Miriam’s merit which accompanied the Israelites throughout their forty year’s journeys in the desert. “When Miriam died [as mentioned here in Verse 1] the well was taken away.” (Taanith 9a). Hence the crisis of the lack of water. See also Vol. II, pp. 240-241, and Note 436 <i>ibid.</i></i> this rock [in Kadesh] is the same flint which was in Horeb;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">124</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 17:6.</i> therefore they explain [that the expression] <i>‘its’ water</i> [in <i>that it give forth ‘its’ water</i>] refers to the water which it used to give, for now as a result of Miriam’s death the fountain ceased [and was only restored in the merit of Moses and Aaron].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">155</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Taanith 9a.

The meaning is: “Have you not eaten? Of course you have eaten!”</i> But Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote [that the meaning of the verse is]: “Do we indeed have power to bring you forth water out of the rock?” He means thereby to explain that Moses said to them: “<i>Hear now, ye rebels</i> against G-d, who say, <i>‘and why have ye brought the assembly of the Eternal</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">167</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 4.</i> <i>unto this evil place?’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">168</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 5.</i> Do we have the power by natural means to bring you forth water out of this flint? You should therefore recognize that this is all from G-d, for it is He Who took you out of Egypt, and brought you to this place, and it is He Who will feed you here.” This is similar to what he [Moses] told the people in the case of the manna, <i>and ye shall know that the Eternal hath brought you out from the land of Egypt</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">169</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 16:6.</i><br>In my opinion this letter <i>hei</i> [in the word <i>hamin</i> — “out of”] indicates a [real] query, [and the meaning thereof is as follows]<i>:</i> “<i>Are we to bring you forth water out of this rock</i> or not?” For sometimes Scripture explains a question in its positive and negative aspects, such as: <i>whether there are trees therein or not?’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">170</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 13:20.</i> <i>whether thou wouldest keep His commandments, or not?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">171</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 8:2.</i> — and at other times it mentions only the positive aspect, [such as in the following verses]<i>: Is this your youngest brother?;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">172</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genssis 43:29.</i> <i>Know ye Laban the son of Nachor?;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">173</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 29:5.</i> <i>Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">174</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zechariah 7:3.

He said to them: “<i>Hear now, ye rebels. — What do ye devise against the Eternal?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">175</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nahum 1:9.</i> — <i>Are we to bring you forth water out of this</i> strong <i>rock</i>? Will this event happen or not?” [i.e., “Do you believe that it is within His power to do it, or not?”] He thus stressed that their [behaviour was a serious] rebellion, telling them they were wanting in faith, and that the reason for their quarrelling with him was because they thought that G-d would not act wondrously for them, in a similar manner to that which it says, <i>And they tried G-d in their heart … ‘Can G-d prepare a table in the wilderness … Can He give bread also?’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">176</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 78:18-20.</i> Similarly the Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">177</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Aboth 5:4.</i> “Ten times our ancestors in the wilderness tried the Holy One, blessed be He.” [Moses’ question was thus] like a query as to the belief of the person addressed, [of which we find examples] in many places in Scripture: <i>Must I then bring thy son back?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">178</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 24:5.</i> which means: “Is that your wish?” <i>Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">179</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Chronicles 18:5.</i> which means, “If that is your advice.” Here too, [the meaning of Moses’ question is]: “Do you think that we shall bring you forth water out of this rock?” The same is also my opinion with regard to [the following verses]: <i>Did I reveal Myself?;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">163</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i> The sense is: “Did I not reveal Myself, although your sons, by their actions appear to belie it!”</i> <i>Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before Me?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">180</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Kings 21:29.</i> <i>Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">166</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 3:11.

Of course you will judge!”</i> For all these are questions, but their purpose is to ask about [the truth of] something well-known, so that the person who is asked is compelled to admit [the truth of the fact] against his will. Thus [<i>Did I reveal Myself?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">163</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i> The sense is: “Did I not reveal Myself, although your sons, by their actions appear to belie it!”</i> means]: “Have I revealed Myself to your father’s house and chosen you? Since you know this, then <i>Wherefore kick ye at My sacrifice and at Mine offering?</i>”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">181</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 2:29.</i> <i>Do ye thus requite the Eternal</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">182</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 32:6.</i> with such a requital! Similarly, “<i>Hast thou eaten of the tree</i>, about which <i>I commanded you</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">166</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 3:11. The meaning is: “Have you not eaten?

The sense here is: “Do you not see [that it is best that you return to the city in peace]!”</i> is a genuine inquiry about a matter [as to which the questioner is] in doubt, [David saying to Zadok the priest]: “If you ‘advise’ it, then return to the city,” [and the usage of the term <i>‘seest’ thou</i>? means “do you see fit?”] as in the expression: “I see the words of Admon”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">184</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kethuboth 109a.</i> [which means: “I find the opinion of Admon correct”].

Afterwards the Israelites sent them a message [saying] that they would not [even] approach the cities at all, but they would go <i>by the highway</i> which leads up to the land of Canaan, which is a paved road traversed by all people, and if they or their animals drink [even] of the waters of the rivers on the way, whilst passing through the rivers, they would pay them for the benefit they derived from them. Therefore Moses said [here in Verse 19] <i>there is no hurt</i>, meaning that in [passing through their land] there would be no damage of any sort.

It is likely that when Aaron came down from offering the Daily Whole-offering, and burnt the incense and kindled the lamps, Moses took him up to Mount Hor whilst he was still dressed in the garments of the [High] Priest, and [then] he stripped him of them. And according to the plain meaning of Scripture [the verse is to be interpreted: <i>And strip Aaron of his garments</i> in order to] put on him the shrouds of a dead man which he had prepared for him, and then he stripped Eleazar of his ordinary clothes and put the sacred garments upon him, as he did to him on the day of initiation. And according to the Midrashic interpretation of our Rabbis,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">211</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifra, <i>Tzav Milu’im</i> 1:6.</i> various miracles occurred in connection with these garments.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">212</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The miraculous nature of the event which occurred here has been explained in various ways, but from Ramban’s quotation of it the explanation is as follows: Since it is obvious that Aaron would not be left naked for even one moment, we must say that as soon as the uppermost garment was removed from him, the Divine Glory wrapped him with a corresponding celestial garment. But if so, how could Moses proceed to remove the lower garments “in their proper order,” since there was now a [celestial] upper garment upon them? The answer is given in the following text of the Torath Kohanim [Sifra]. See the following note.</i> Thus they said: “How could Moses strip Aaron of his garments in their proper order? Are not the upper ones always on top, and the lower ones always underneath? But G-d did miraculous deeds for Aaron at the time of his death, even more so than during his lifetime. Thus Moses put Aaron upon the rock and stripped him of the priestly garments, and [alternative] celestial garments clothed themselves [upon him] <i>underneath</i> them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">213</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Underneath them.” Thus as Aaron was stripped of his <i>upper</i> robe, he was covered with a corresponding celestial garment <i>underneath</i> his tunic [which was the lower garment directly on his body]. Moses could then proceed to remove the tunic [which was now <i>above</i> the celestial “upper” robe, thereby fulfilling the Divine command of stripping Aaron of his garments “in their proper order.” As he removed the tunic, a corresponding celestial tunic likewise clothed itself <i>underneath</i> the celestial robe. This interpretation of the Torath Kohanim is based upon Malbim’s commentary.</i> <i>And he put them upon Eleazar his son</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">214</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 28.</i> But how could Moses put the garments upon Eleazar in their proper order?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">215</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For as soon as he stripped Aaron of the upper robe, Moses had to put it upon Eleazar, so that he would be clothed in the order in which the clothes are worn. If so, how could he later on put the lower garments [such as the tunic] underneath? In answer to this question the Torath Kohanim presents a second miracle, namely, that Aaron found himself arrayed in eight celestial garments and then he put on the eight garments of the high priesthood in opposite order, first the robe and finally the tunic. [Ordinarily this is not permitted, but since he was now attired already in the celestial garments underneath it was permissible for him to do it.] When Moses removed the tunic from upon Aaron and put it upon Eleazar it was thus done in proper order. See my Hebrew commentary pp. 380-381.</i> [We must say that this was not natural], but that G-d bestowed a great honor upon Aaron at the time of his death, even more so than during his lifetime, in that celestial garments first [miraculously] clothed themselves underneath [the other garments], and then Moses stripped Aaron of the priestly garments in their proper order,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">216</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., in the order he had put them on after he found himself arrayed in the eight celestial garments, which as explained above (Note 215), was in the opposite order: first the robe and finally the tunic as the uppermost garment.</i> and [also] put them on Eleazar in their proper order.” So it is taught in the Torath Kohanim.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">211</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifra, <i>Tzav Milu’im</i> 1:6.</i>"

                    "AND THE CANAANITE, THE KING OF ARAD, HEARD. We find [mentioned] amongst the conquests of Joshua: <i>the king of Arad, one</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">217</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 12:14. Ramban is to ask: since the verse in Joshua clearly indicates that Arad was in Canaan proper, to the <i>west</i> of the river Jordan: so how — as indicated in this section — could its king fight against Israel whilst they were still on the eastern bank of the Jordan:</i> Moreover, in the section dealing with the [stages of the Israelites’] journeyings [in the wilderness], it is written, <i>And the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who dwelt in the south in the land of Canaan</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">218</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 33:40.</i> and Scripture does not refer to [that land which is] on the eastern side of the Jordan as “the land of Canaan” without qualification, just as He said, <i>the land of Canaan according to the borders thereof</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">219</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 34:2. Verses 10-12 <i>ibid.</i>, define the eastern boundary of Canaan as the Jordan: hence we see that the word “Canaan” does <i>not</i> include land <i>east</i> of the Jordan. So the question reappears: how come that the king of Arad, a land west of the Jordan, came to fight the children of Israel who were now encamped <i>east</i> of the Jordan?</i> Furthermore, [if Arad was to the east of the river Jordan], Moses should have given the land of the king of Arad to one of the tribes of Israel [as their inheritance, in the same way that he divided up the other lands which he conquered]; but Scripture always tells<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">220</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 13-15; Joshua 12:6, etc.</i> that it was the land of Sihon and Og, the two Amorite kings, which Moses gave to the two tribes [Reuben and Gad] and to the half-tribe [of Menasheh], whereas the nine tribes and the [other] half-tribe [of Menasheh] received their inheritance after they crossed the Jordan into the land of Canaan. Perhaps we may explain [that the reason for this is] that Israel utterly destroyed their land, and did not settle therein at all. But that is not [the] correct [explanation of the word <i>v’hacharamti</i> in Verse 2]. Similarly Rashi explains [that the expression: <i>And Israel vowed a vow unto the Eternal, and said, If Thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand</i>,] <i>then ‘v’hacharamti’ their cities</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">221</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, verse 2.</i> means that Israel would dedicate the spoils [of those cities] to the Most High [and not that they would destroy the cities themselves].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">222</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hence the question would be: If Arad was on the eastern side of the Jordan, why did Moses not give it to any of the tribes?</i><br>The correct interpretation appears to me to be that this king of Arad <i>dwelt in the south</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">218</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 33:40.</i> on the <i>western</i> side of the Jordan, in the land of Canaan near the Jordan, bordering onto the land of the children of Judah, near Hebron which is in the south;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">223</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 13:22: <i>And they went up into the south, and came unto Hebron</i>.</i> <i>and he heard</i> from afar <i>of the coming of the children of Israel</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">218</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 33:40.</i> so he [the king] <i>came by the way of Atharim</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">224</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here in Verse 1.</i> to the plains of Moab to fight there against Israel. This is the meaning of the word <i>‘vayishma’</i> (<i>and he heard</i>) [i.e., he heard from a distance]. Therefore Scripture relates that he <i>dwelt in the south in the land of Canaan</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">218</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 33:40.</i> [to point out] that he came from another land, to the place where Israel was [encamped]. Then <i>Israel vowed a vow unto the Eternal</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">221</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, verse 2.</i> that if He would deliver him [the king of Arad] into their hand, they would dedicate all that they had to G-d. And Scripture [further] relates<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">225</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 3.</i> that G-d heard their prayer, and the vow that they had vowed unto G-d, they fulfilled,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">226</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Isaiah 19:21: <i>and they shall vow a vow unto the Eternal, and shall perform it</i>.</i> for they killed them now in the days of Moses, as He had commanded, <i>None devoted, that may be devoted of men, shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">227</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 27:29. See Ramban <i>ibid.</i></i> and they gave all their spoils <i>into the treasury of the House of the Eternal</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">228</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 6:24.</i> Scripture continued by relating <i>here</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">225</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 3.</i> that Israel also laid their cities waste when they came into the land of Canaan, after the death of Joshua, in order to fulfill the vow which they had made, and they called the name of the cities Hormah [Utter Destruction].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">229</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban is thus saying that the account in Verse 3 of the destruction of the cities refers to an event which took place after Joshua’s death, and which is recorded in detail in the Book of Judges, as will be explained further on. Thus we must say that this future event was told by G-d to Moses, who wrote it down — like the rest of the Torah — at the command and dictation of G-d. Compare Ramban’s remarks in his introduction to the Commentary on the Torah, (Vol. I p. 9): “However, it is true and clear that the entire Torah — from the beginning of Genesis to <i>in the sight of all Israel</i> [the last words in Deuteronomy] — reached the ear of Moses from the mouth of the Holy One, blessed be He”. Since there is no difference in time for G-d, it is written in the past tense, for past, present, and future are all the same to Him. See also Ramban Vol. II, p. 192, for the reason why the tenses are often used interchangeably in prophetic statements.</i> It is with reference to this that it is stated in the Book of Judges, <i>And the children of the Kenite, Moses’ father-in-law, went up out of the city of palm-trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of Arad</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">230</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Judges 1:16.</i> and it is [further] written, <i>And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they smote the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And he called the name of the city Hormah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">231</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 17.</i> It was then that this vow [recorded here] was fulfilled, but Scripture, however, completed the account of the matter here, just as it did in the section speaking of the descending of the manna, [where it states]<i>: and Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept. And the children of Israel did eat the manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat the manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">232</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 16:34-35.</i> [an event which occurred] after the death of Moses, until <i>the morrow after the Passover</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">233</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 5:11.</i> Similarly, <i>These are the names of the men that shall take possession of the Land for you</i> etc.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">234</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 34:17.</i> constitutes a prophecy that these men will [still] live and function [at that time]; for it is impossible [to say] that G-d would specify for them men about whom there was a doubt [as to whether they would still be living; for if so], He should rather have commanded Joshua [about them] at the time of the division of the Land. [But since the command was already given to Moses, we see that the Torah speaks of future events, and that this constitutes a Divine promise that these specified men would live until the time of the division of the Land.]<br>It is also correct to say that already now in the days of Moses the Israelites destroyed this king [of Arad] <i>and his people with the edge of the sword</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">235</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 17:13.</i> and called the place of the battle Hormah, and after they crossed the Jordan, Joshua also killed the [then] king of Arad<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">217</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 12:14. Ramban is to ask: since the verse in Joshua clearly indicates that Arad was in Canaan proper, to the <i>west</i> of the river Jordan: so how — as indicated in this section — could its king fight against Israel whilst they were still on the eastern bank of the Jordan:</i> who ruled after [the one in the days of Moses], together with the [other] Canaanite kings who ruled at that time. When the children of Judah came into their cities, they destroyed them as well, and called the name of the cities Hormah,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">231</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 17.</i> because [by destroying them] they fulfilled the vow which their fathers had made, <i>and I will utterly destroy their cities</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">221</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, verse 2.</i> Therefore He stated here, <i>and he called the name of ‘the place’ Hormah</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">225</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 3.</i> but there [in the Book of Judges] it is written, <i>and he called the name of ‘the city’ Hormah</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">231</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 17.</i> meaning the name of every city which belonged to the king of Arad, as they fulfilled their vow, and their spoils were dedicated to the Sanctuary. Thus [according to this interpretation] everything mentioned here happened at the same time [in the days of Moses], except that He mentioned, <i>and their cities</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">225</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 3.</i> [the destruction of which] occurred at a later time, when they came into their cities. It is for this reason that it says [here], <i>and I will utterly destroy their cities</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">221</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, verse 2.</i> and does not say “[I will destroy] them and their cities,” because the verse [only] mentions their vow concerning the future, but they themselves [the people] died in the battle [at the time of Moses] and were destroyed there. And the language of the verse fits in well with this explanation of ours, for it should have said: “and He delivered up the Canaanites ‘into their hand,’ and ‘they’ utterly destroyed them and their cities, and ‘they’ called the name of the place Hormah.” But Scripture omitted the pronouns<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">236</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus it does not say that He gave the Canaanites “into their hand” [which would refer exclusively to the hand of the Israelites <i>of the days of Moses</i>]. Nor does it say <i>vayacharimu</i> (and “they” destroyed), but instead says: <i>‘vayachareim’</i> [literally: “and ‘he’ destroyed” — i.e., the one who destroyed them — now, or later on in the days of Joshua]. Similarly it does not say <i>vayikr’u</i> (“and ‘they’ called”), the name of the place Hormah [in the days of Moses] but <i>‘vayikra’</i> [“and ‘he’ called” — the one who called — now or later on].</i> in order to indicate that He delivered the Canaanites into the hand of whoever of the Israelites He delivered them, some of them now and some of them at a later time, for G-d hearkened to their prayer, and they fulfilled their vow.",
                    "THAT ISRAEL CAME BY WAY OF ‘ATHARIM.’ According to the opinion of Onkelos [who rendered the verse: “that Israel came by the way which ‘the spies’ had gone”], the meaning is that when the spies came and went up from the south<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">237</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 13:22.</i> and returned, the inhabitants of the Land noticed them, and this Canaanite who dwelt in the south heard about them, and so he followed the same route which they had taken, until he reached the camp of the Israelites. Onkelos has interpreted it well. And our Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">238</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rosh Hashanah 3a.</i> “What was the report which he [the Canaanite] heard?” — because they found difficulty with the verse in the section [dealing with the stages] of the [Israelites’] journeyings,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">239</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban by implication differs here from Rashi, who quoted this text of the Rabbis on the verse before us. According to Ramban, the Rabbis made their remark with reference to the verse mentioned further on. Ramban’s reason for disagreeing is apparent, because in our verse it states quite clearly the reason why the Canaanite came, namely because he had heard of the sending of the spies, as explained, and therefore he went to fight against Israel. But further on no reason is given and no war mentioned. Therefore Ramban says, the Rabbis found it necessary to give their interpretation.</i> which states, <i>And the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who dwelt in the south in the land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">240</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 33:40.</i> since it does not mention there any war, or any other event whatsoever. Therefore they said that the report was about the death of Aaron which is mentioned there,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">241</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 38-39.</i> and Scripture thus states that Israel’s enemies heard of the death of the righteous one, and they were consequently encouraged by that event to fight against Israel. Likewise the Rabbis have said<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">242</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tanchuma, <i>Chukath</i> 18.</i> that this Canaanite was Amalek, and [therefore the Israelites] did not conquer his land, nor take any part of it; but they completely destroyed their cities.",
                    "AND HE TOOK SOME OF THEM CAPTIVE. “It was only one maidservant [of the Israelites that was taken captive].” This is Rashi’s language, based upon the words of our Rabbis.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">243</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yalkut Shimoni, <i>Chukath</i> on this verse.</i> The Sages were induced to make this comment because they were of the opinion that Israel never suffered defeat at the hands of any enemy except at times when they sinned; such as at the first war with Amalek, because they had said, <i>Is the Eternal among us, or not?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">244</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 17:7.</i> and at the second [war with Amalek]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">245</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 14:45: <i>Then the Amalekite … came down and smote them</i>.</i> on account of their sin in the [matter of the] spies, when Moses had warned them not to wage war.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">246</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 41-42.</i> But in all wars which were by [Divine] command, not one man of them was missing<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">247</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See further, 31:49.</i> throughout the days of Moses. Therefore the Sages explained this verse as meaning that they [the enemy] took captive from Israel that captive whom they had in their possession, namely this maidservant whom the Israelites had [previously] captured from them. [The usage here of the term <i>shevi</i> (captive) in the sense of “servant” is] similar to the expression <i>‘b’chor hashvi’</i> (<i>the firstborn of the captive</i>)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">248</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 12:29.</i> which means <i>the firstborn of ‘the maidservant’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">249</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 11:5.</i> [and so here too the word <i>shevi</i> denotes a maidservant], since Scripture here does not say: “and he captured men from him,” or “[he captured] women and children.”<br>According to the plain meaning of Scripture, the sense of the verse is that these Canaanites did not kill any of the Israelites, but took a few of them captive, and when G-d [later on] delivered them into their hands, they brought them all back, and not a single one of them was missing. Scripture mentioned this in order to inform us that since the Israelites saw at first that the Canaanites were winning [the war], they made this vow to dedicate all spoil which they would take to G-d, and G-d hearkened to their voice. It is possible also that we explain that G-d was angry with these Canaanites because they came from a distant land to fight against Israel, <i>and feared not G-d;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">250</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 25:19.</i> therefore He wanted that they should be utterly destroyed, and caused them to prevail at first so that the Israelites would vow to destroy them [and dedicate the spoils] to G-d."

But Moses said: ‘The Holy One, blessed be He, called it a <i>nachash</i> (serpent); therefore I will make it of <i>nechosheth</i> (brass) — since the one word resembles the other [in sound].” This is Rashi’s language, based upon the words of our Rabbis.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">251</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Bereshith Rabbah 31:8.</i> But I do not understand this, for the Holy One, blessed be He, did <i>not</i> mention to Moses [the word] <i>nachash</i>, but said to him, <i>Make thee ‘saraf’</i> (<i>a fiery serpent</i>)!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">252</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 8.</i> But the intention of the Sages is that Moses was guided by the substantive name thereof [which is <i>nachash</i>; and <i>saraf</i> is merely a particular description of a certain kind of serpent — a “fiery” serpent — hence he made the <i>saraf</i> which G-d mentioned to him from <i>nechosheth</i> (brass), corresponding with its substantive name].<br>It appears to me that the secret of this matter is that this is one of the ways of the Torah, every deed of which is a miracle within a miracle. Thus [the Torah] removes injury by means of the cause of the injury, and heals illness by means of the cause of the sickness, as the Rabbis have mentioned in connection with [the verse], <i>and the Eternal showed him a tree</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">253</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 15:25.

See Vol. II, p. 211, Note 259.</i> Now it is a well-known medical principle that all people bitten by poisonous creatures become dangerously ill when they see them, or [even] when they [only] see their likeness, so that if people who have been bitten by a mad dog or other mad animals look into water,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">255</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Or any mirror.” See Vol. I, p. 259.</i> they see there the image of the dog or the attacker, and [this] can [cause them to] die, as is written in medical books and mentioned in the Gemara of Tractate Yoma.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">256</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yoma 84a.</i> Similarly doctors protect them from [people] mentioning in their presence the name of the animal that bit them, [and they forbid people] to mention it at all, because their minds cling to this thought and do not turn away from it altogether until it causes their death. [The doctors] have already mentioned that it is an empirical fact, amongst the wonders of reproduction, that if the urine of a person bitten by a mad dog is put in a glass receptacle after he has become rabidly sick, there will appear in that urine the likeness of the young of small dogs. And if you pass the liquid through a cloth and filter it, you will not find any trace of them at all; but if you return the liquid to the glass bottle, and it remains there for about an hour, you will again clearly see in it the small dogs. This is a true fact, and of the wonders of the powers of the soul. Now in view of all this, it would have been correct that the Israelites, who had been bitten by the fiery serpents, should <i>not</i> look upon a serpent, and should <i>not</i> mention it or bring it to mind at all. But the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded Moses to make for them the likeness of a fiery serpent, which was [the creature] that killed them. And it is well-known that these fiery serpents have red eyes and wide heads, and their bodies at their necks are like brass. Therefore Moses could not fulfill His command to make a fiery serpent except by making a serpent of brass, which appears similar to a fiery serpent.

                    "THE ELDERS OF MIDIAN. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented that “it is possible that the five kings of Midian<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian</i> (further, 31:8). It is thus with the five “kings” of Midian [who are here in Verse 4 called “elders”] that Moab took counsel with, but not with <i>the elders of Midian</i> mentioned in Verse 7, who were lords not “kings.” Ramban will refute this interpretation of Ibn Ezra.</i> were the elders.” But if so, [the expression] <i>and the elders of Moab and ‘the elders of Midian’ departed</i> [further on in Verse 7] does not refer to the [same] “elders of Midian” mentioned at the beginning [here in Verse 4: <i>And Moab said unto ‘the elders of Midian’</i>] since kings would not have gone to him [Balaam on such a mission] and [“the elders” mentioned in Verse 7 must perforce have been] princes, as is [expressly] written,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 8: <i>and ‘the princes’ of Moab abode with Balaam.</i></i> [but not “kings”]. Furthermore, according to the opinion of our Rabbis<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tanchuma, <i>Balak</i> 7.</i> who said [that the reason why Moab turned for assistance to Midian, their traditional enemy, was because they said]: “The leader of these people [the Israelites] grew up in Midian; [let us ask them about his characteristics]” — it would have been fitting for the Moabites to send [the delegation] to <i>the elders of Midian</i>, not to the kings or the people, for it was the elders who would know Moses’ nature.<br>It appears to me that originally there were kings in Midian, but Sihon the king of the Amorites <i>had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto the Arnon</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 21:26.</i> He [also] fought against the children of Ammon and took [part] of their land, just as the Ammonite king said to Jephthah, <i>Because Israel took away my land, when he came up out of Egypt</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Judges 11:13.</i> and Jephthah replied to him that they had taken it from Sihon.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 15-23.</i> In [the Book of] Joshua it is [also] written, <i>And their border was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 13:25.</i> and Sihon furthermore fought against the kings of Midian and conquered their land, and made them <i>his servants bringing tribute</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Samuel 8:6.</i> and took the crowns off their heads, depriving them of the splendor of royalty, and he allowed them to remain as judges of the land of Midian under his authority. Therefore [although as Ibn Ezra says, they were indeed once kings of Midian], they are called <i>‘the elders’ of Midian</i>, similar in expression to [she shall <i>go up</i>] <i>to the gate unto ‘the elders’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 25:7.</i> [which means “the judges”]. A proof for this [that the kings of Midian were appointed judges — “elders” — by Sihon] is the verse in [the Book of] Joshua: <i>and all the kingdoms of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the chiefs of Midian, Eri, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, ‘the princes of Sihon,’ that dwelt in the land</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 13:21. This verse clearly shows that the former <i>chiefs of Midian</i> had now become <i>the princes of Sihon</i>.</i> thus indicating that [the land of Midian arid its chiefs were] under the suzerainty of Sihon. The meaning then, of [the phrase] <i>and the kings of Midian</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 31:8: <i>and they slew the kings of Midian</i>.</i> is “the former kings of Midian,” just as it says: <i>the chiefs of Midian … the princes of Sihon</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 13:21. This verse clearly shows that the former <i>chiefs of Midian</i> had now become <i>the princes of Sihon</i>.</i> Similarly it says [of Zur, one of the five people mentioned as a king of Midian],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian</i> (further, 31:8). It is thus with the five “kings” of Midian [who are here in Verse 4 called “elders”] that Moab took counsel with, but not with <i>the elders of Midian</i> mentioned in Verse 7, who were lords not “kings.” Ramban will refute this interpretation of Ibn Ezra.</i> <i>he was the head of the people of ‘a fathers’ house in Midian</i>,’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 25:15.</i> but he was no longer king. Or it may be that the reason [for the use of the phrase] <i>the kings of Midian</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 31:8: <i>and they slew the kings of Midian</i>.</i> is that they had regained their royal status at that time.<br>But I do not know a reason for that which Scripture says, <i>and Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 4 here.</i> when it could have said [concisely] at the beginning, <i>And Balak the son of Zippor</i>, “king of Moab,” <i>saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 2.</i> Perhaps Balak was a mightly man of valor, very famous for <i>the acts of his power and of his might</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Esther 12:2.</i> and therefore Scripture mentioned that although Moab had a powerful king at that time, who was <i>courageous among the mighty</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Amos 2:16.</i> they nonetheless <i>were afraid</i> and <i>were overcome with dread because of the children of Israel</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 3 here. — Hence the double expression of the verse: <i>And Moab was sore afraid … and Moab was overcome with dread.</i></i> That is why Jephthah said [to the king of Ammon], <i>And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab?</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Judges 11:25.</i> for one does not frighten a king except by [mentioning the defeat of another] king who was greatly feared.<br>It is possible that since Moab [at that time] did not have a king, the people stood in great fear <i>because of the children of Israel</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 3 here. — Hence the double expression of the verse: <i>And Moab was sore afraid … and Moab was overcome with dread.</i></i> therefore they did two things: they sent to the elders of Midian saying, ‘<i>Now will this people lick up</i> etc.,’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 3 here. — Hence the double expression of the verse: <i>And Moab was sore afraid … and Moab was overcome with dread.</i></i> and they appointed this man [Balak] as their king on the advice of Midian, and afterwards they all sent [a deputation] to Balaam at the command of the king. This is the meaning of [the expression] <i>at that time</i> [<i>and Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab ‘at that time’</i>],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 4 here.</i> namely [at the time that] they took counsel about the problem of Israel, and sent the messengers to Balaam. The meaning, then, of <i>And Balak saw</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 2.</i> is that he [Balak] who was one of the princes of Moab, and a mighty man of valor, took action in this matter and said to Moab, “<i>Come, let us deal wisely</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 1:10.</i> with [this] people,” and they thereupon appointed him king on the advice of Midian. In the Midrash Bamidbar Sinai Rabbah I have seen [the following text, corroborating the above interpretation]:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Bamidbar Rabbah 20:4.</i> “<i>And Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 4 here.</i> But was he not originally [merely] ‘a prince,’ as it is said, <i>Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba</i> [<i>the princes of Sihon</i>]?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 13:21.

And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra said that “[the reason why Scripture here] did not mention them [the elders of Midian] is because Balak was the principal party [in this matter], and it was he who sent the mission.” Similarly, [the verse stating] <i>and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 8.</i> [omits “the elders of Midian”] because the main [impetus of the] mission came from their lord [the king of Moab].<br>The correct explanation is that the elders of Midian — who were perhaps the first kings thereof — came from their country to Balak to take counsel about the problem of Israel, and they all decided to send [a mission] to Balaam. Therefore Balak sent his princes, his judges and wise men, and they went together with the elders of Midian to the land of Midian, because from there their way led to Balaam’s city; and the elders of Midian remained in their city, while the princes of Balak, who were the delegates, went on their own to Aram [Balaam’s native land].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 23:7: <i>From Aram Balak bringeth me</i>.</i> This is the meaning of [the expression], <i>and the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, in Verse 7.</i> meaning that they all left Balak and went as far as Midian, <i>with the rewards of divination in their hand</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, in Verse 7.</i> <i>And ‘they’ came unto Balaam</i>, [<i>and spoke unto him the words of Balak</i>]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, in Verse 7.</i> — this refers to the elders of Moab, about whom Scripture states, <i>and he sent messengers</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 5.</i> not to the elders of Midian.",

Moreover, he did not [in fact] know that G-d would give him permission to go with other, greater, princes! Rather, the meaning [of Balaam’s words] is that G-d did not want him to go at all.

For G-d had said to Israel, <i>Go up, take possession</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 1:21.</i> but they did not believe [that they would conquer it], and said instead, <i>Let us send men</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 22.</i> — so Moses asked G-d [and He told him, <i>Send thou men</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 13:2.</i> meaning: ‘I do not command you, but if you wish to do so, send them’]. And this case [here too] is similar, for why did Balaam have to tell [Balak’s servants], <i>tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the Eternal will speak unto me more</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 19.</i> [since G-d had already told him not to go with them]? It was because he harbored an evil intention in his heart [persisting in the hope that G-d would agree that he should go to Balak], and so G-d told him: ‘[You may] <i>go with them</i>, but be careful only to speak that which I will say to you.’ And the proof for my interpretation [that G-d was angry with Balaam for his evil intention in persisting in his request to go to Balak, and that <i>go with them</i> is a concession, not a command], is the following verse, <i>And G-d’s anger was kindled because he went</i>.” These are the words [of Abraham ibn Ezra].<br><i>Yet all this availeth me nothing</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Esther 5:13.</i> For the explanation of the Gaon [Rav Saadia, that G-d wanted him to go with more honorable men] is not correct, for G-d told Balaam, <i>Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people, for they are blessed</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 12.</i> [thus clearly indicating] that He forbade him to go in order that he should not curse the people, and he did not prohibit him from going because these princes were not sufficiently important, so how could it be permissible for him to go with other princes! And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra’s explanation [that G-d was angry with him because of his persistence in his evil desire to go] is also not correct, [for it would mean] that G-d changed His mind and withdrew His word [in finally allowing Balaam to go], because of the persistence of the person making the request! And the matter of <i>Send thou men</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 13:2.</i> is not so [as Ibn Ezra explained it]; and I have already explained its [correct] meaning [there]. Furthermore, far be it from G-d to punish [a person for doing] something for which He had [previously] given permission! And in the Midrash the Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tanchuma, <i>Balak</i> 8; Bamidbar Rabbah 20:11. — From this Midrash too, it is obvious that there was no Divine concession here at all to Balaam, but that he was merely led on the path that he desired to tread.</i> “From here you learn that on whichever path a person desires to tread, he is led.”<br>The correct interpretation of this matter appears to me to be that at first G-d forbade him to curse the people, <i>for they are blessed</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 12.</i> and so there was no purpose in Balaam going with them [the elders], since he could not curse them [Israel], and they did not require him for any other reason. Therefore He said [to Balaam], “<i>Thou shalt not go with them</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 12.</i> and do not curse the people, <i>for they are blessed</i>.” Now it is self-understood that Balaam informed them of G-d’s words [although Scripture does not expressly say so], but [nonetheless] Balak sent him [messengers] a second time, because he did not believe him [that G-d did not allow him to go, but thought that he merely wanted a greater reward], and so he showed him greater honor by sending <i>princes, more in number, and more honorable than</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 15.</i> the first, and promised to increase his reward and honor. But Balaam answered them that the matter did not depend upon money, nor upon his [own] will; but it was entirely in the hand of G-d, and he would again ask Him what He commands him [to do].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verses 18-19.</i> This [answer of Balaam] was properly given, for what could he know of <i>the knowledge of the Most High</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 24:16.</i> — and <i>the counsel of the Eternal</i> is good <i>forever</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Psalms 33:11. In other words, it is always good to seek G-d’s advice.</i> and <i>He doth instruct sinners in the way</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 25:8. G-d is hereby described as giving instructions even to sinners [such as Balaam] in the path they should follow.</i> and He would inform him <i>what he shall answer the messengers of the nation</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 14:32.</i> or He would tell him what would happen to them [the Moabites] in the future. And G-d told him: “I have already informed you that the people <i>are blessed</i> and that you will not be able to curse them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 12.</i> But now that they [the messengers] have come back to you, <i>if the men are come</i> merely <i>to call thee</i>, meaning that they will agree to your going with them [although it is] on condition that you shall not curse the people, as I informed you at the beginning, then <i>rise up, go with them; but only the word which I speak unto thee, that shalt thou do</i>, for even if I command you to bless them, you shall [do so and] not be afraid of Balak.” This then is the meaning of [the expression], <i>if the men are come ‘to call thee’</i> [i.e., if they merely ask you to go with them, despite being fully aware that you may not curse Israel — then go with them]. And this was the wish of <i>the Glorious Name</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 28:58.</i> from the [very] beginning — that he [Balaam] should go with them after telling them that he would not curse them [Israel], and that he would conduct himself towards them [entirely] as G-d would command him — because it was the Will of G-d, blessed be He, to bless Israel through the mouth of the prophet of the nations. Thus Balaam ought to have disclosed this to the princes of Balak and to say to them: “Now G-d has only permitted me to be invited by you [i.e., to accompany you], and [only] on the express condition that I do not curse the people, and that if He commands me to bless them, that I shall do so, and if they are not agreeable to these [conditions], they should leave me alone.” But even on this second occasion Balak said, <i>come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 17.</i> [thus indicating that] he did not want Balaam for the purpose of fortelling future events or for any other purpose, except that of cursing the people. And Balaam, because of his overriding desire to go, did not inform them of this [Divine message with the conditions mentioned above], and did not tell them anything at all; [instead], <i>Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with them</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 21.</i> like someone who is eager to fulfill their wish.

[Our verse] saying: <i>And the ass saw the angel of the Eternal standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand</i> does not mean that she [actually] saw the sword, let alone the angel; but the verse is hinting that since the angel was ready to strike them, she <i>trembled very exceedingly</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 27:33.</i> because she felt as if people were coming to slaughter her. [We must explain that the ass merely felt the angel’s presence, but did not actually see him, because] if we were to say that those angels that appear in human form — as I have mentioned in the section of <i>Vayeira</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 18:1 (Vol. I, p. 231).</i> — <i>can</i> be seen even by the eyes of an animal, then how was it that Balaam did not see him, since he was not smitten with blindness! It is, however, possible that He Who gave the ass the power of speech, also bestowed upon her an additional power of vision, so that she saw the likeness of a human being, although Scripture does not mention it. Thus G-d opened the eyes of the ass [and she indeed saw the angel], just as Scripture mentions [later] in regard to her master, [<i>And the Eternal opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the Eternal</i>].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 31.</i> For the whole matter of the ass was a great miracle, being a “new creation” like those that were created at twilight [on the eve of the first Sabbath],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">72</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Aboth 5:9.

The reason for this miracle was to show Balaam <i>Who hath made man’s mouth, or Who maketh a man dumb?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">73</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 4:11.</i> and to make him realize that it is G-d Who opens the mouth for the dumb,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">74</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Proverbs 31:8.</i> and [since He can make the dumb speak], how much more so can He make dumb at His Will the mouth of those who can speak, and can also put words into their mouths, so that they speak in accordance with His Will, for everything is in His power.

Hence the commentators explained it as meaning <i>lulei</i> — “unless,” and the angel is thus saying, in defense of the animal, that “had she not turned aside from me, I would have killed you [Balaam].” Ramban later on offers his own interpretation of the verse and the word <i>ulai</i> actually used by Scripture.</i> SHE HAD TURNED ASIDE FROM ME.

But in my opinion it is used here in its literal meaning [“perhaps:” — implying a doubt]; for the ass felt the presence of — or saw<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">93</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ramban above, Verse 23.</i> — the angel, but did not know what it meant, and [the reason why she <i>turned aside</i>] was because of the drawn sword, as animals are wont to do [when they see a drawn sword]. Therefore the angel said to Balaam: “<i>And the ass saw me and turned aside from me</i>, [although it was only] because of a doubt that she <i>turned aside</i> from before me [not knowing my intentions], for I came to slay you, but I would have saved her life, since the sin is in you and not in the ass.”",

Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented that “the word <i>gam</i> [meaning “also”] is a proof that the ass died after it had spoken. And the meaning of [the phrase] <i>and saved her alive</i> [which implies that she should have died, were it not for the angel that kept her alive] is that when [even] a human being sees an angel, he dies [straightaway, whereas the ass lived on for a while until after she had spoken to Balaam] — proof being [Jacob’s statement]: <i>and my life is preserved</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">94</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 32:31. Since Jacob gave thanks to G-d for preserving his life after seeing the angel, one can deduce that it is usual for a person to die after having seen an angel. See this also clearly in Judges 13:22.</i> — and how much more so [does it follow that] an animal, which has no common factor with an angel, as a human being has [ought to die immediately upon seeing an angel].”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">95</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus according to Ibn Ezra the angel was saying: “Since even a human being, who shares with an angel the spirit of G-d, dies upon seeing an angel, how much more so the ass should have died <i>immediately</i> she saw me! But <i>I saved her alive</i> for some time after she had seen me, in order that she should speak to you.” Nonetheless, <i>after</i> she had spoken to Balaam she <i>did</i> die, as implied by the angel’s words: “had the ass not turned aside, ‘also’ you I would have killed,” meaning: The ass will now have to die, because I [only] saved her life so that she should speak to you. But had she not turned aside, I would have ‘also’ killed you.” Ramban disagrees with this interpretation, and explains that the ass did <i>not</i> die, as explained further on.</i><br>But the word <i>gam</i> cannot be interpreted as Ibn Ezra explains it, for [if so, we do not find any circumstances under which] <i>both</i> of them [Balaam and the ass] would die; because now when she did turn aside, the ass died and Balaam was saved alive, and had she not turned aside, he [the angel] would have killed Balaam and saved the ass alive!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban’s meaning is as follows. According to Ibn Ezra’s explanation, now that the ass turned aside, she alone was killed [since she had fulfilled her purpose of arousing Balaam], but had she not turned aside, both Balaam <i>and</i> the ass would have been killed by the angel. To this Ramban replies that this cannot be so, because Scripture states explicitly here that had the ass <i>not</i> turned aside, the angel would have killed Balaam but <i>saved her</i> [the ass] <i>alive;</i> and now that she <i>did</i> turn aside, he saved Balaam, but killed the ass [according to Ibn Ezra]! Hence Ibn Ezra’s statement that both Balaam <i>and</i> the ass would have been killed is not possible under any circumstances! Therefore the word <i>gam</i> must be interpreted differently. [See my Hebrew commentary p. 292, for sources in Hebrew commentaries on the elucidation of this difficult text of Ramban].</i> However, the word <i>gam</i> is [to be interpreted] as Rashi explains it, its meaning being as if [the word-order of the verse were] inverted, namely: <i>gam haragti othchah</i> [“also would I slay thee,” meaning to say: “not only would I have held you up on your journey, but I would also have killed you”]. And the meaning of the expression <i>and saved her alive</i> is [not that “I would have kept her alive <i>temporarily</i>, but later on killed her,” as Ibn Ezra explained, but that the angel was stressing that] “the entire [burden of] sin is upon you [Balaam], and [therefore] I would have killed you because of it, [but would have kept her alive even had she <i>not</i> turned aside], for she has done no sin for which she ought to die. Thus her act of turning aside, which she did on account of me, was for your good [only] and not for her sake at all, [because she would anyhow not have been killed], and you have therefore smitten her for no reason, and have repaid her evil for good.”<br>Now Scripture does not say whether Balak’s princes were present with Balaam at these events, or [it may be] that they were riding ahead of him and there was a [considerable] distance between them and him [so that they did not notice any of these events]. The most likely [interpretation, however] is that they were together with him, because they did not become separated from him, and they saw the ass turning aside and Balaam smiting her, but thought that she was merely behaving as bad animals do, because they did not hear her speak; and they certainly [did not hear] the words of the angel, who was [visible only] <i>to</i> the <i>opened eyes</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">97</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 24:4.</i> of Balaam. But our Rabbis have said<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">98</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Bamidbar Rabbah 20:12.</i> that the princes of Moab were astonished, because they saw a miracle the like of which had never occurred in the world. And they [also] said<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">98</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Bamidbar Rabbah 20:12.</i> that as soon as the ass had finished speaking; she died, in order that the nations should not say [about her]: “This is [the ass] that spoke,” and should not make her [an object of] idol-worship. Moreover, the Holy One, blessed be He, was concerned [even] about the honor of the wicked, [and therefore killed the ass so that] people should not say: “This is [the ass] that caused Balaam’s downfall.” All this is possible, [but is] in accordance with a tradition, for Scripture [itself] does not speak about her dying at all, as I have explained."

This is to be understood as the Targum [Onkelos] rendered it.” For the Rabbi’s [Rashi’s] Targum contained [the following text]: “He directed his face toward the wilderness in which the children of Israel had made the [golden] calf.” But this is not found in accurate editions of Onkelos’ Targum,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">181</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nor is it found in our texts of Onkelos.</i> and is [only] written in some of the texts [of Onkelos], which were emended on the basis of the Targum Yerushalmi,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">182</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is also found in our texts of the Targum of Yonathan ben Uziel. — There are three traditional <i>Targumim</i> (translations) of the Pentateuch: <i>Onkelos, Yonathan</i>, and <i>Yerushalmi</i>. The latter was lost for many centuries, and only parts of it have reached us. Recently, however, a copy of this Jerusalem Targum has been found in its full version, and the text quoted here by Ramban appears in it.</i> but the correct interpretation is as we have explained [above, that Balaam turned to the wilderness in order to receive Divine communication as he had previously, and not because that was the place where they had made the golden calf].<br>Scripture says [in describing Balaam]: <i>Who seeth the vision of the Almighty</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">179</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 4.</i> meaning that he now saw through a lucid spectrum, as did the early prophets of whom it is said, <i>And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob by the Name ‘E-il Sha-dai’</i> (<i>G-d Almighty</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">183</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 6:3.</i> Or it may be that Balaam [only] received [the Divine communication] through a degree [of vision] less than theirs, since <i>‘the vision of’ the Almighty</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">179</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 4.</i> is not the same as <i>the Almighty</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">183</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 6:3.</i> Thus the patriarchs saw by <i>‘E-il Sha-dai’</i> (<i>G-d Almighty</i>), [a double expression], whereas Balaam saw only by <i>‘the vision of’ the Almighty</i> — two degrees lower than them [because only one Name of G-d is used, and he only saw a <i>vision of</i> it]. Therefore Balaam described himself as [one who saw <i>the vision of the Almighty</i>] <i>with opened eyes</i>, which is the degree of prophecy attained by the sons [i.e., the disciples] of the prophets, as it is said, <i>Eternal, open the eyes of these men</i> etc.,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">184</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Kings 6:20.</i> and in connection with Balaam himself it says, upon his seeing the angel, <i>And the Eternal opened the eyes of Balaam</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">185</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 22:31.</i> Now do not [be induced to] think otherwise than that which we have explained in this matter, because of the statement of our Rabbis who said in the Sifre:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">186</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifre, <i>Berachah</i>, 357.</i> “<i>And there hath not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">187</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 34:10.</i> <i>In Israel there hath not arisen</i>, but in the [other] nations of the world there has arisen. And who was he? It was Balaam. But there was a difference between the prophecy of Moses and that of Balaam, because Moses did not know about what G-d was going to speak to him [as will be explained further on], and Balaam knew about what He was going to speak to him, as it is said, <i>The saying of him who heareth the words of G-d</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">179</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 4.</i> Moses did not know when He would speak to him, as it is said, [<i>then he heard the Voice</i>] <i>speaking unto him</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">188</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 7:89.</i> and Balaam knew when He would speak to him, as it is said, <i>and knoweth the knowledge of the Most High</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">189</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 16.</i> He spoke to Moses while he was standing, as it is said, <i>But as for thee</i> [Moses], <i>‘stand’ thou here by Me</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">190</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 5:28.</i> and to Balaam He spoke when he was fallen down, as it is said, <i>fallen down, yet with opened eyes</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">179</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 4.</i> [The prophecy of Balaam may be] compared to the cook of a king, who knows what expenses the king has for [the food on] his table.”<br>The explanation of the meaning of this <i>Beraitha</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">191</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The teachings of the Sifre are considered <i>Beraithoth</i>. See in Vol. II, p. 133, Note 209, for fuller explanation of this term.</i> is as follows: Scripture stated, <i>And there hath not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">187</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 34:10.</i> and our Rabbis explained that this verse does not come to declare the superiority of Moses’ prophecy over that of the other prophets, since Scripture has already informed us of his superiority over them in two places — in the verse, <i>And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob by the Name ‘E-il Sha-dai’</i> (<i>G-d Almighty</i>), <i>but by My Name, the Eternal, was I not known unto them</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">183</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 6:3.</i> and in the verse, <i>If there be a prophet among you</i> etc.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">192</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 12:6.</i> But now [in speaking of Moses’ prophecy]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">187</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 34:10.</i> He did not say about Moses that he knew G-d, as Moses had requested, <i>Show me now Thy ways, that I may know Thee</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">193</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 33:13.</i> for the verse there<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">187</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 34:10.</i> does not say that “he knew G-d face to face,” but says: <i>whom ‘the Eternal’ knew face to face</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">187</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 34:10.</i> because it is telling us an explanation of [the nature of] Moses’ prophecy. It is thus saying that to Moses our teacher [the Divine communication] used to come clearly, like one who speaks to his friend <i>face to face</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">187</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 34:10.</i> and tells him his words and his meaning until he sees from [the expression on] his face that he understands his words and his intention, and [indicates this] by saying so and by showing on his face that he recognizes what [his friend] wants. Thus the Rabbis [in the Sifre quoted above] said that Balaam had this [degree of prophecy only] when he prophesied in honor of Israel, for he fully understood the words of G-d and His intention and wish in all that was destined to happen to Israel. And even so there was still a difference between the prophecy of Moses and that of Balaam! For Moses did not know what He would tell him, and about what topic or which commandment He would speak to him, but he was ready at any time for the Divine communication, and the Holy One, blessed be He, would command him as He so desired. But Balaam had to concentrate and think about the [particular] matter which he wanted [G-d to speak to him about], and he would retire into solitude and prepare himself spiritually so that the [Divine] Spirit<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Vol. I, p. 59, Note 237. See also <i>ibid.</i>, pp. 228-231, where Ramban discusses at length the subject of angels in relation to prophecy.</i> would come upon him, <i>peradventure the Eternal will come to meet</i> him, as is explicitly stated here [in our verse]. He knew [also] that if the Spirit <i>were</i> to come upon him, it would speak to him [only] about that subject which he had thought of, and not about any other matter. Furthermore, Moses did not know when He would speak to him, because he did not have any fixed time for the [Divine] communication, but whenever Moses wanted it and directed his mind towards [receiving] a Divine communication, He would speak to him; as Moses said, <i>Stay ye, that I may hear what the Eternal will command concerning you</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">194</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 9:8. Although Moses had not been told in advance that G-d would speak to him, he knew that if he concentrated on receiving a Divine communication, he would surely receive one.</i> and similarly whenever G-d wanted to command him <i>from the Tent of Meeting</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">195</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 1:1.</i> <i>then he</i> [Moses] <i>heard the Voice speaking unto him</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">188</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 7:89.</i> But Balaam knew how to determine the [exact] moment when he would have the [Divine] communication, and the Spirit would only rest upon him at that moment. Perhaps this is “the moment” that our Rabbis speak of in Tractate Berachoth<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">196</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Berachoth 7a. The Gemara there states that there is “one moment” every day when G-d, is angry, and Balaam knew precisely when that moment was. The anger is occasioned when the sun begins to shine “and the kings of the world put on their crowns and prostrate themselves to the sun.” — It is the Rabbis’ way of saying that the deification of nature by man occasions the displeasure of the Creator, for how could they change His glory for that which is His creation and tool!</i> and in Tractate Sanhedrin,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">197</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 105b. The same text as in Berachoth 7a is also quoted there.</i> and at that moment he [thought he] would utter the curse, and it was [only] at that moment that the Spirit would rest upon him, and never at any other time. Similarly the fact that Moses remained standing [during the Divine communication] indicates his superiority, whereas Balaam’s falling down denoted his inferiority, [implying] that he could not endure the prophecy, just as it says, <i>if we hear the voice of the Eternal our G-d any more, then we shall die;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">198</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 5:22.</i> <i>Go thou near, and hear</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">199</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 24.</i> The Rabbis further said [in the Sifre quoted above]: “[The prophecy of Balaam may be] compared to the cook of a king, who knows etc.” [This comparison refers] to the first distinction [between Moses’ prophecy and that of Balaam, namely, that Moses did not know in advance about what G-d would speak to him, whereas Balaam did know], and the intention of the Rabbis thereby is to say that the cook knows what are the expenses of the [upkeep of the] king’s table, but his minister who <i>is trusted in all</i> his <i>house</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">200</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A reference to Moses. See above, 12:7.</i> and knows his secrets, does not know the expenses of the household. This example indicates that the Sages’ intention was to say that Balaam himself knew, after concentrating [his intention on receiving a Divine communication], that G-d would tell him [to say]: <i>How shall I curse, whom G-d hath not cursed?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">201</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 23:8.</i> and the whole of the blessing [mentioned in the verses], and that afterwards he would hear the communication in [precisely] those words which he had thought of in his heart. This is, as I have mentioned,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">202</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 22:5; 31.</i> because he was a diviner, and thus future [events which would befall the people of Israel] would come into his heart [through divination]; but now on account of Israel he also heard the [Divine] utterance about them, and therefore he now prided himself, saying, <i>The saying of him who heareth the words of G-d</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">179</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 4.</i><br>Now I have seen this same subject which is taught in the Sifre [quoted above] said in another form in the homiletics of Bamidbar Sinai Rabbah,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">203</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Bamidbar Rabbah 20:1.</i> but there is no need for me to prolong [this subject]. The general idea is that the Sages intended to say that Balaam’s prophecy came to him in words which he clearly understood, and the reason for this was, as the Sages have said,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">203</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Bamidbar Rabbah 20:1.</i> so that the nations of the world should not have an excuse to say: “If we had had a prophet like Moses, we would have served the Holy One, blessed be He.” But the degree of Balaam’s prophecy was [nonetheless] lower than that of the other prophets, because it was [only] by <i>the ‘vision’ of the Almighty</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">179</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 4.</i> as we have explained. And so also the Rabbis have said in Vayikra Rabbah:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">204</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Vayikra Rabbah 1:13.</i> “The Holy One, blessed be He, only revealed Himself to the prophets of the [other] nations of the world with a half-communication,’ as it is said: <i>‘Vayikar Elokim’</i> (<i>And G-d ‘happened to meet’ Balaam</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">205</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 23:4.</i> [instead of saying <i>‘vayikra’ Elokim</i> — and G-d ‘called’ to Balaam], but to the prophets of Israel [He revealed Himself] with a complete communication, as it is said: <i>‘Vayikra’</i> (<i>And He called</i>) <i>unto Moses</i>.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">195</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 1:1.</i> The meaning of [the expression] “a half-communication” you will understand from what we have explained [above]."

To include all the empires in the “four kingdoms” that will rule the world, as symbolized by the <i>four beasts</i>, Ibn Ezra suggested that both Greece and Rome should be counted as the “third beast,” and the “fourth beast” will then be the Islamic empires of his times. Ramban totally rejects this interpretation.</i> and introduced into it the kingdom of Ishmael [i.e., the Arabic kingdoms of his times] <i>for</i> their <i>fear was fallen upon</i> him,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">293</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Esther 8:17.</i> and he argued: “How can one not count such a great and powerful empire [as the Arabic empire, amongst those seen in Daniel’s visions]!” This argument stems from a lack of knowledge, for each of the four kingdoms which Daniel saw, gained power one after another, and each one prevailed over its predecessor and seized the kingdom [of the world] from it. [Likewise] each one continued the enslavement and exile of Israel during the period that it ruled. Therefore Daniel saw in his dream that the Chaldeans [i.e., the Babylonians] would [be the first] to enslave us [i.e., the Jewish people], and that after them the Persians would seize the kingdom, and would [continue] to enslave us, and after them in their stead would come the Greeks; and after them the Romans would become powerful and seize the kingdom, and subjugate us <i>until the time of the end</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">294</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Daniel 12:9.</i> [of the exile], for their kingdom would only come to an end by the hand of the redeemer [i.e., the Messiah]. Thus [the extent of] our exile is the duration of [rule of] the four kingdoms [Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Rome], and even if there will be other empires in the world contemporaneously with these four kingdoms, Scripture does not count them and Daniel did not see them [in his visions], since he did not have to see them at all in order to know the [date of the final] redemption. And indeed in the days of [the kingdoms of] Persia and Greece, and today also, there are great empires in the world, besides those of Rome and Ishmael, such as the peoples of India, Ethiopia, Rumania, the Tartars, and others. And if so, [Ibn Ezra] should have counted many kingdoms! And [another reason why Ibn Ezra is mistaken is that] it is well-known that it was the Romans who exiled us in the days of Vespasian and Titus, and not the Ishmaelites [the Arabs]; therefore wherever we are, whether under Ishmael, or [anywhere] <i>from India, even unto Ethiopia</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">295</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Esther 1:1.

And indeed this [seduction to] immorality was not instigated as a plan of the [Moabite] women, but was done upon the advice of their men and their leaders. [The idea] came to them from the elders of Midian, as it says of the Midianites, <i>for they harass you, by their wiles wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">305</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 25:18.</i> for <i>they beguiled</i> them by means of immorality in order to draw them astray [to worship] Baal-peor. Therefore it is [indeed] possible that Balaam was behind this counsel, since he was considered by them [the Moabites] <i>great in counsel</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">306</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 32:19.</i> and his intention was to bring evil upon Israel, and therefore he did everything in his power to this end, as it is said, <i>And the Eternal thy G-d would not hearken unto Balaam</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">307</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 23:6.</i> and therefore <i>they slew</i> him <i>with the sword</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">308</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 31:8.</i><br>But according to the simple meaning of Scripture, it is not alluding here to the counsel of Balaam, but only [alludes to it] when it says afterwards, <i>Behold, these</i> [women] <i>caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam</i> etc.,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">309</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 16.</i> just as it does not mention here the counsel of the elders of Midian, and only [mentions it] when it says, <i>for they harass you</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">305</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 25:18.</i> Thus [it is only] after the event [had happened], at the time of [describing] their punishment, that He mentions what was the source of the evil that befell them. He is [thus] saying that what happened [to them] as a result of the desire for sexual pleasure which exists naturally in men and women from [the time of] their youth, was only [the result] of an evil plan [whose purpose was] to lead them astray [into worshipping Baal-peor]; therefore [the instigators of this plan] deserve a severe punishment. The interpretation of the verse, <i>Come and I will counsel thee what this people shall do to thy people in the end of days</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">310</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 24:14.</i> is thus indeed as I have explained [there].<br>It is also possible according to the simple meaning of Scripture that Balak at first wanted to curse them [the Israelites] and to wage war against them, and he did not want to give them permission to enter his borders at all. But when Balaam told him<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">311</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ramban above, Verse 17.</i> that he would not prevail over them, and informed him that they would only destroy his land and his people <i>in the end of days</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">310</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 24:14.</i> then he [Balak] <i>brought forth bread and wine</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">312</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 14:18. See Ramban to Deuteronomy 23:5, that the Moabites did meet the Israelites with bread and water when they were near their country; only the Ammonites failed to do so. — Ramban introduces here the element of “wine,” as a clear reference to what the Rabbis in the Sifre here have stated: “[The Israelite] entered; a gourd of wine lay near her. Said she to him, ‘Wouldst thou like to drink?’ etc.”</i> in the plains of Moab [i.e., <i>in Shittim</i>], and enticed them [with the daughters of Moab] as if he were their friend. This is [the meaning of the phrase] <i>‘bidvar’</i> (<i>through ‘the word’ of</i>) <i>Balaam</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">309</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 16.</i> for it was because of his words [i.e., his prophecy that the Israelites would not conquer their land now, that the Moabites] did so [i.e., that they did not fight them, but tried to seduce them and lead them astray through their women]. But because it was Balaam’s desire to curse them, and he allowed Balak to hire him [and would indeed have cursed them] were it not for <i>the righteous acts of the Eternal</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">313</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Micah 6:5.</i> <i>Who turned the curse into a blessing</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">307</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 23:6.</i> therefore <i>they slew</i> him <i>with the sword</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">308</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 31:8.</i> for both the hirer [Moab] and the hired one [Balaam] were punished, just as He said, <i>and because he hired against thee Balaam the son of Beor</i> etc.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">314</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 23:5.</i>"

That figure is nowhere near the total number of people killed according to Rashi, for even if two people were killed by each court of twenty-three judges, over 7,000 people were killed. Ramban further on, explains that in actual fact none of the people were put to death.</i> although all those <i>who joined themselves to Baal-peor</i> died, as it is written, <i>for all the men that followed Baal-peor, the Eternal thy G-d hath destroyed them from the midst of thee</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">319</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 4:3.</i><br>But the meaning of <i>every one his men</i> is that the judges should kill all those <i>who joined themselves</i> [<i>to Baal-peor</i>], that is to say, each court should judge [the men of] its own tribe and its [groups of] thousands, as it is written, <i>So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and full of knowledge, and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds … and officers, ‘tribe by tribe’</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">320</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 1:15.

Verse 12 then continues with the thought: “Since it is My desire to reward Phinehas, <i>Therefore say to the children of Israel … ”</i> Thus the contents of Verse 11 was not to be told to Israel (Aboab). This interpretation of Ramban is unlike that of Rashi from whose words it may be implied that even the contents of Verse 11 was to be told to the people, the object being that they were not to speak disparagingly of Phinehas for having killed a prince of Israel, for G-d testified that he is a descendant of Aaron, who was a lover of peace, and what Phinehas did was to save the honor of Israel.</i> that Moses was to tell this to Israel. Now Scripture does not say: “<i>and it shall be unto him, and to his seed after him ‘an everlasting priesthood, ’</i>” as He said about Aaron,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 29:9: <i>and they shall have the priesthood by a perpetual statute</i>.</i> but instead it says: <i>‘the covenant’ of an everlasting priesthood</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 13.</i> and it [also] says, <i>I give unto him ‘My covenant’ of peace</i>, meaning that He will give him a covenant with peace cleaving to it, whereas in the case of Aaron it says <i>for splendor and for beauty</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 28:2. Since this indicates the very high spiritual status achieved by Aaron [as alluded to in the words of <i>kavod</i> and <i>tiphereth</i>, which represent certain Emanations], it was not necessary to mention <i>‘the covenant of’ an everlasting priesthood</i>, indicating the perfect Unity. But in the case of Phinehas it does not say that his priesthood was <i>for splendor and for beauty;</i> therefore the verse had to mention <i>‘the covenant of an everlasting priesthood</i>, indicating that Phinehas’ priesthood was also in the perfect Unity, <i>because he was zealous for his G-d</i> (Abusaula). See also my Hebrew commentary, p. 305.</i> Therefore it says [here concerning Phinehas]: <i>because he was zealous for his G-d</i>.

And they gave this advice [later on] to Moab, to encourage their daughters to prostitute themselves with them [the Israelites], and thereby cause them to join Baal-peor, and to draw them away from G-d, even though this advice is not [explicitly] mentioned there. Moreover, [a proof that the Midianites gave this idea to the Moabites is] that they even sent them their own king’s daughter to commit harlotry with them, this being the meaning of the expression, <i>and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of the prince of Midian, their sister</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 18 here.</i> For were this not done with the knowledge [and encouragement] of the counsellors of the [Midianite] kingdom, what was the distinguished Midianite princess seeking in Shittim, in the plains of Moab, that she should come to the camp of a foreign people, for Israel was in the plains of Moab, in Shittim, and how did this [important] Midianite woman come to be there? But [the only reasonable explanation of this is that] she was very beautiful, and therefore the elders of Midian sent her there, because they said: “Through the figure of a beautiful woman many people become corrupted.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This saying is quoted in Tractate Yebamoth 63b, from the book Ben Sira.</i> It is probable that Balaam was also involved in [giving] this counsel, for on his return from the land of Moab [after he departed from Balak]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 24:25.</i> he passed through Midian, from where he had come, and he deliberated with the counsellors of the kingdom.

And it indeed appears so [that Balaam participated in giving this evil advice], for the Israelites would not have killed one who had prophesied except after [receiving a special] permission of the Torah [to do so, and we do not find any mention of such permission]. But after they had been told [that they were to punish the Midianites because] <i>they harass you by their wiles wherewith they have beguiled you</i> etc.,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 18 here.</i> [it is self-understood] that all those who took part in this beguilment were liable to the death penalty, and therefore they killed Balaam as well, since they knew that he was the one who had proposed this evil design.<br>Now the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded [the Israelites] to avenge themselves of them [the Midianites], but as for the Moabites, He had already warned them, <i>Be not at enmity with Moab</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 2:9.</i> For Israel had at first come to the border of Edom, and He had warned them [against fighting] them, [as it is said], <i>and take ye good heed unto yourselves;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 4.</i> and afterwards they arrived at the border of Moab, and He told Moses, <i>Be not at enmity with Moab</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 2:9.</i> He said furthermore, <i>Thou art this day to pass over the border of Moab, even Ar; and when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, harass them not</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 18-19.</i> and He [further] stated, <i>Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the valley of Arnon; behold, I have given into thy hand Sihon</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 24.</i> And after all this Balak <i>saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 22:2.</i> that is, to the two Amorite kings, Sihon and Og, and then this whole episode [of the blessings of Balaam, and the seduction at Shittim by the Moabite women] took place.

And because He warned him about Moab, therefore He also admonished him with respect to the children of Ammon, so that Moses should not think that [the fact that] He only forbade him [not to fight] Moab was [tantamount to an implied] permission to [wage war] against the children of Ammon who had also dealt evil to the Israelites <i>because they met</i> them <i>not with bread and with water</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 23:5.

Perhaps [the reason why the individual families of each tribe are mentioned here is that] when the Land was divided among the tribes [in equal parts] according to the opinion of our Rabbis,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Baba Bathra 122a. See Vol. I, pp. 570-572.</i> so that Simeon, the smallest of the tribes,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The tribe of Simeon numbered 22,200 men (further, Verse 14).</i> took [a share] equal to that of Judah, the most populous of the tribes,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The tribe of Judah numbered 76,500 (Verse 22).</i> it was also divided up [amongst each tribe itself] according to the number of families that went down to Egypt. Thus they made out of Reuben’s inheritance four [equal] parts [because it consisted of four main families: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi], and the Hanochites received a share equal to that allotted to the Palluites, the Hezronites, and the Carmites, even though these [four families] were not all equal in <i>the number of names … by their polls</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 1:18.</i> This is the reason here for counting [the people] in this manner, [namely] by counting the family according to those who went down to Egypt, and it does not mention [here] <i>by their polls</i>, even though it mentions the numbers [of each tribe] as a whole. And when Scripture states [here]: <i>To the more thou shalt give the more inheritance</i>, [<i>and to the fewer thou shalt give the less inheritance</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 54.</i> which seems to indicate that the Land <i>was</i> divided according to population,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As is indeed Rashi’s opinion. See further, Verse 54, for a complete discussion. Ramban also touches briefly on this subject in Genesis 48:6 (Vol. I, pp. 571-572).</i> it refers to the [division amongst the] members of each [small] family,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus when, for example, the family-group of Hanochites received their quarter-share of Reuben’s overall inheritance, they further subdivided it amongst their members according to the number of individuals in each family. However, they themselves received a share — [one quarter] — of the total inheritance of Reuben, equal to that received by the three other <i>main</i> families of Reuben, despite differences in their respective populations. Likewise each of the twelve tribes, whether large in population, like Judah, or small like Simeon, received an equal share of the whole Land [that is, equal in value, although not in area] (Baba Bathra 122a).</i> for each [of these minor families] received a share according to their numbers <i>by their polls</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 1:18.</i> It is for this reason that in the Book of Joshua [when speaking of] the division of the Land, it says <i>according to their families</i>, as is stated in the verse, <i>And the lot for the tribe of the children of Judah ‘according to their families,’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 15:1.</i> and similarly in the case of all the other [tribes]. Or the meaning of [the phrase there] <i>according to their families</i> may be: “to ‘all’ the families of the tribe” [meaning that each minor family of each tribe was taken into account, according to the numbers of its individual members, as explained above]; or that they divided the Land <i>according to their families</i>, so that each family received its share in one place, so that it did not become mixed up with [that of] another family. This [latter interpretation] appears to me to be the correct one."

But the family of Ohad [the other son of Simeon mentioned <i>ibid.</i>, in Genesis] became extinct. Similarly five families of the tribe of Benjamin [had by now ceased to exist], for he [Benjamin] went down to Egypt with ten sons,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 46:21.</i> and here<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verses 38-39.</i> Scripture only counts five.” This is Rashi’s language.<br>And Rashi has furthermore written:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Verse 24.</i> “All the families were called by the names of those [of their ancestors] who went down to Egypt, but those who were born after that time were not called families [in their own right and their own names], except for the families of Ephraim and Menasheh, both of whom were born in Egypt, and Ard and Naaman, the sons of Bela the son of Benjamin.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 40. The meaning of Rashi is as follows: Since Ard and Naaman are mentioned in Genesis 46:21 among the sons of <i>Benjamin</i> who went down to Egypt, and here in Verse 40 they are referred to as sons of <i>Bela</i>, who was himself a son of Benjamin, we must perforce say that the ones referred to here were not the same as those mentioned there [but had the same names]. Furthermore we must perforce say that the Ard and Naaman mentioned here were not amongst those who went down to Egypt, for otherwise Scripture would have mentioned them there in Genesis, in the same way that it counts the grandchildren of Judah and Asher. This is the meaning of Rashi when he wrote: “except for the families of Ephraim and Menasheh, both of whom were born in Egypt, and Ard and Naaman, the sons of Bela the son of Benjamin.” However, the question then arises: why are Ard and Naaman, the sons of Bela, counted here, since they were not amongst those who went down to Egypt? In other words, why were they an exception to the rule? To answer this question Rashi quotes the statement which he found in the work of Rabbi Moshe the Preacher.</i> And I have found [it written] in the work of Rabbi Moshe the Preacher<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See above in <i>Seder Naso</i>, Note 146.</i> that their mother [that of Ard and Naaman — i.e., the wife of Bela] went down to Egypt when she was already pregnant with them [and therefore they formed separate families, since they are also included amongst ‘those who went down’ to Egypt]. Now if this is a tradition, well and good. But if not, I say that Bela had many children, but from each of these two, Ard and Naaman, there came forth a large family, [and therefore they formed families in their own right and in their own names], whereas the descendants of the other sons were called by Bela’s name, and [only] the descendants of these two [Ard and Naaman] were called after their [own] names.” All this is the language of the Rabbi [Rashi], of blessed memory.<br>But I am astonished at [the words of] Rashi. For the difficulty [raised by Rabbi Moshe the Preacher] is not that Scripture counts the family of the Belaites by itself,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 38.</i> and [nonetheless counts also] the families of the Ardites and the Naamites his sons, by themselves,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 40.</i> for that was [indeed] because they became [large] families, as the Rabbi [Rashi] has said. This is the way of Scripture, as in the case of the children of Judah [where it counts Hezron and Hamul, who were <i>grandchildren</i> of Judah, as forming families by themselves],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 21. Hezron and Hamul were the sons of Perez, who was the son of Judah. Although Perez himself formed a family (Verse 20), the verse nonetheless counts independently the two families formed by his sons Hezron and Hamul.</i> and [likewise] the children of Menasheh and Ephraim,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verses 29-32; 36. There too, the grandchildren [and even great-grandchildren] are counted as separate families.</i> and likewise the children of Asher.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verses 44-45. Asher’s grandchildren are counted as separate families.</i> However, if we say that Ard and Naaman were born to Bela, the son of Benjamin, <i>after</i> they went down to Egypt, they should not have been counted here as [separate] families!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban’s meaning is as follows. Rashi seems to have understood that Rabbi Moshe the Preacher found it difficult to understand why <i>Ard and Naaman</i> are mentioned as forming separate families, since their father Bela is also mentioned as forming a separate family. To answer this, Rabbi Moshe gave the explanation that their mother was already pregnant with them when she went down to Egypt ; and Rashi himself [because he questioned the authenticity of that tradition] gave a different reason, i.e., that they formed large families in their own right. Ramban is saying that Rabbi Moshe’s difficulty was <i>not</i> why Scripture mentions them as forming separate families, because the answer to that question is clearly that they had large families, which were worthy of constituting separate families and hence were not included in Bela’s family. That this is so we see clearly from the examples of Judah, Menasheh, Ephraim and Asher, as Ramban points out. Yet Rabbi Moshe did not ask about the children of these people, but only about <i>Ard and Naaman</i>, the children of Bela! Clearly this is because Scripture only counts as separate families the children of those who went down to Egypt, [e.g. Judah and Asher] or who were already there when Jacob went down [e.g. Menasheh and Ephraim]. But in the case of Ard and Naaman, there is a difficulty, whether we say that they went down to Egypt with Jacob or not, [as explained further on in Ramban], and it is <i>this</i> difficulty which Rabbi Moshe the Preacher was trying to answer. The question whether they went down to Egypt with Jacob depends, of course, on when they were born. For if we say that they were born to Bela <i>after</i> he went down to Egypt, the question arises: Why are they counted <i>here</i> as separate families, since only those who were among the <i>seventy souls</i> who went down to Egypt with Jacob are counted here as separate families? And if they were born <i>before</i> Jacob’s family went down to Egypt, then since they are not mentioned in Genesis, the total number of people who went down must have been seventy-two, so why does Scripture omit them and count only seventy? In brief it was <i>this</i> difficulty that Rabbi Moshe the Preacher had in understanding the verses, a difficulty which applies only to <i>Ard and Naaman</i>, and not as Rashi assumed his question to be, which would apply to other cases as well.</i> And should we say that [Ard and Naaman, the sons of Bela] were born to him <i>before</i> [he went down to Egypt], then [the family of Jacob] would consist of more than seventy souls, for then the sons of Benjamin were ten<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 46:21.</i> apart from these two sons of Bela [thus the overall total of people who went down to Egypt would be seventy-two, whereas Scripture there only mentions a total of seventy]!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 46:27.</i> It was for this reason [and not for the reason implied by Rashi’s explanation] that Rabbi Moshe the Preacher explained that their mother [the wife of Bela] was already pregnant with them [Ard and Naaman, when the family of Jacob went down to Egypt], and [since they were not yet born] they are not counted there [in the Book of Genesis], but here they are included<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 40.</i> among those born [<i>before</i> the descent into Egypt, because their mother was already pregnant with them when they went into Egypt].<br>Now if this is a tradition [of the Rabbis, that Bela’s wife was pregnant with Ard and Naaman when she went down into Egypt], we will force ourselves to accept it despite its difficulty.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The difficulty is that in Genesis 46:8-27 the verses do <i>not</i> mention Ard and Naaman amongst the <i>seventy souls that came into Egypt</i>, because although their mother came into Egypt when she was pregnant with them, they were not yet born and thus one cannot say that <i>they ”</i>came into Egypt.” Yet here they <i>are</i> counted as forming separate families, although only the families of those <i>that came into Egypt</i> are counted as separate families, and the reason is because they “came into Egypt” since their mother was pregnant with them! Thus there is an apparent contradition! Furthermore, we will have to differentiate between the case of Jochebed and that of Ard and Naaman, as will be explained further on.</i> We will also have to say that Jochebed<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Genesis 46:15 (Vol. I, pp. 554-558.)</i> was born [whilst they passed] through the walls [of the border-city of Egypt], on the very day that they entered into [Egypt], and therefore she <i>is</i> included amongst the <i>seventy souls</i> [<i>that came into Egypt</i>], whereas these [Ard and Naaman, the sons of Bela] were born some months [after Jacob’s family had come to Egypt, and therefore they are not included amongst the <i>seventy souls that came into Egypt with Jacob</i>]! But if it is not a tradition of our Rabbis [but merely a personal opinion of Rabbi Moshe the Preacher] we will reject this theory of his with all our might. But we can say that Ard and Naaman, the sons of Benjamin [as mentioned in Genesis 46:21], died without children, and Bela [their brother] wanted <i>to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 25:7.</i> and therefore he gave his sons the names of his brothers who had died. Perhaps Bela [actually] performed the rite of marriage with their wives, since he was the firstborn,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 46:21: <i>And the sons of Benjamin: Bela</i> etc. — The duty of marrying a childless brother’s wife falls primarily on the eldest of the remaining brothers ; if he refuses the duty devolves upon any other surviving brother (Yebamoth 39a).</i> and Ard and Naaman, the sons of Bela [from these marriages] became heads of families <i>to raise up a name</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 25:7.</i> for Ard and Naaman the sons of Benjamin, who were amongst those that went down to Egypt.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 46:21.</i><br>The correct interpretation appears to me to be that the Naaman and Ard<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Genesis 46:21 they are listed in the following order: <i>And the sons of Benjamin: Bela … and Naaman … and Ard</i>. Ramban now suggests that these two people who are mentioned there in Genesis as the “sons” of <i>Benjamin</i>, are in fact identical with the <i>Ard and Naaman</i> mentioned here in Verse 40, who are described as the sons of <i>Bela</i>, who was the son of Benjamin. Naaman and Ard were thus in fact the <i>grandchildren</i> of Benjamin, and it is the style of Scripture to describe grandchildren as children, as Ramban shows. This explains why Ard and Naaman are counted here as separate families in their own right, since they <i>were</i> amongst those who went down to Egypt [as stated explicitly in Genesis 46:21], and there is thus also no problem about how we reach the number of <i>seventy souls</i> who went down there. In other words, the Ard and Naaman mentioned there in Genesis [as the sons of Benjamin] and here in Verse 40 [as Benjamin’s grandsons] are identical persons.</i> who are counted amongst <i>the sons of Benjamin</i> in the section of <i>And these are the names</i> etc.,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 46:8-27.</i> were in fact [not the real <i>sons of Benjamin</i> at all, but they were] <i>the sons of</i> his firstborn son <i>Bela</i>, as is stated explicitly here,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 40.</i> and similarly Scripture counts them [as the sons of Bela] in the Book of Chronicles.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Chronicles 8:3-4: <i>And Bela had sons, Addar … and Naaman. Addar</i> mentioned is synonymous with <i>Ard</i>.</i> Such is the custom of Scripture to speak of grandchildren as children [and therefore in Genesis 46:21 the verse describes them as <i>the ‘sons’ of Benjamin</i>], just as it says, <i>Laban the son of Nahor</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 29:5. Nahor was actually his grandfather, for Bethuel was his father. See Ramban <i>ibid.</i>, Vol. I, p. 360.</i> and in the Book of Chronicles it is written, <i>The sons of Shem: Elam, and Asshur, and Arpachshad, and Lud, and Aram, and Uz, and Hul, and Gether and Meshech</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Chronicles 1:17.</i> although the last four were in fact his grandchildren!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Their father was Aram, the son of Shem — see Genesis 10:22-23.</i> And even though Scripture did not treat the sons of Perez [as the “sons” of Judah, their grandfather,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse there (46:12) mentions that Perez was the son of Judah; and Hezron and Hamul, the sons of Perez.</i> as it did in the case of Ard and Naaman], likewise [it did not treat] the sons of Beriah [as the “sons” of Asher, their grandfather,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">64</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse there (46:17) mentions that Beriah was the son of Asher, and Heber and Malchiel the sons of Beriah.</i> as it did in the case of Ard and Naaman], — this may be because they [Ard and Naaman, the sons of Bela], <i>were born upon</i> Benjamin’s <i>knees</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Genesis 50:23.</i> [i.e., he brought them up], and therefore they are considered his sons. This is then similar to [the verse], <i>And these are the generations of Aaron and Moses</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 3:1. The explanation of this verse quoted now by Ramban is found in Rashi <i>ibid.</i></i> [where the verse proceeds to mention only the sons of Aaron! The explanation given is that they were in actual fact only the sons of Aaron, but since Moses brought them up and taught them Torah, they are also called his children]. Or it may be that because Benjamin had many sons — for he had eight — therefore Scripture included the few [i.e., his two grandsons, Ard and Naaman] amongst the many [real sons, and therefore spoke of all ten as Benjamin’s sons].<br>And it is possible also that we suggest as a hypothesis that Scripture here does not count only the families of those who went down to Egypt, [as Rashi explained above], because [we see] that even those who were born in Egypt from that time onwards are also counted as families, such as Scripture does here in the case of [the families of] Ephraim and Menasheh [whose families are counted separately, even though they did not go down to Egypt with Jacob].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">67</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verses 29 and 35 here. Ephraim and Menasheh of course were not amongst those who went down to Egypt with Jacob, but were born to Joseph beforehand (see Genesis 48:5).</i> It is not a [satisfactory] reason for Scripture to do so [as exceptions in their cases only], on the grounds that they were [already] in Egypt [and therefore are included as separate families together with all those who came down afterwards with Jacob], because it is at the time of the [actual] descent [into Egypt] that one ought to count them all in one number, and to make families out of the <i>seventy souls</i> [who actually went down with Jacob, and it is not correct to include Ephraim and Menasheh who were there but did not go down with the others]!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban’s meaning is that since Scripture’s main purpose is to list the seventy people who “went down” to Egypt with Jacob, it ought to include only those who actually went down at that time. But in actual fact only sixty-eight went down, since Ephraim and Menasheh were already there! And one cannot suggest that an exception is made in their case, since Scripture always stresses the factor of actual descent, referring to the seventy souls <i>who went down</i> to Egypt. Hence we must say that in fact Scripture includes in its list not only those who actually went down to Egypt with Jacob, but also those who did not go down then, and even some who were born later, as explained further on. In that case we can understand that Ard and Naaman are included in the list, even though they were born later.</i> Similarly Scripture always counts them [Ephraim and Menasheh] together with those who went down to Egypt, [such as in the verse]: <i>Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 10:22. This includes Joseph and his two sons, Menasheh and Ephraim (see Genesis 46:19-20), although they did not go down to Egypt with Jacob.</i> So also the sons of Bela [Ard and Naaman] were born afterwards [i.e., after the descent into Egypt, and they are nonetheless counted here as separate families! This proves that the determining factor whether to count a family here separately, is not the criterion of whether its founder was amongst those who went down to Egypt with Jacob, as Rashi said, but must have been some other reason, as will now be explained].<br>But [we must say that] this matter was [as follows]. It was the custom in Israel [for people] to appoint over themselves “heads of fathers’ houses,” and all the descendants of that man would always trace their lineage back to him, and be called by his name in his honor; just as all the Arabs do to this very day, and as do all the Jews who live in their [the Arabs’] countries, calling themselves by family [names, such as] “Ibn Ezra,” or “Ibn Shushan.” This is the meaning of the verse which says, <i>These are the heads of their fathers’ houses</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 6:14.</i> for from the time that they <i>were fruitful and multiplied</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 1:7.</i> in Egypt, they established heads of families over themselves, to whom they would trace their lineage. Perhaps they initiated this practice in Egypt in order not <i>to mingle themselves with the nations</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">72</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 106:35.</i> and so that they would be recognized and distinguishable among their tribes, [for it is there in Egypt] <i>whither the tribes went up, even the tribes of the Eternal, as a testimony unto Israel</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">73</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 122:4.</i> <i>and it</i> became <i>a custom in Israel</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">74</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Judges 11:39.</i> Thus [all] those mentioned here [in this section] were, every one of them, heads of their fathers’ house in Egypt, from whom the family traced its descent. That is why Scripture counts in the house of Machir [the son of Menasheh]: <i>the family of the Machirites</i> and <i>the family of the Gileadites</i> his son,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">75</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 29.</i> and <i>the family of the Iezerites</i> and that <i>of the Helekites</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">76</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 30.</i> the sons of Gilead and their [other] brothers.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">77</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., Asriel, Shechem, Shemida, Hepher (Verses 31-32) — brothers of Iezer and Helek, and sons of Gilead.</i> In a similar way [Scripture records] the children of Judah [and also counts Hezron and Hamul, who were the sons of Perez and grandsons of Judah, as separate families]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">78</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 21.</i> and those of Ephraim,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">79</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 36. There Eran, who was the son of Shuthelach and the grandson of Ephraim, is counted as forming a separate family, although his father Shuthelach is also mentioned there as founding a separate family.</i> for these children mentioned were great and distinguished people, and became heads [of their families]. But [the reason for them being counted as separate families] is not because they [each] gave birth to a large family, as the Rabbi [Rashi] wrote, because they <i>all</i> begot large families [even those who are not mentioned individually], since <i>they were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceedingly mighty</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 1:7.</i> But [Scripture named separate families here] as a mark of honor, meaning that [the members of that particular family] had appointed [that person] as their head. Now most of the families when they were in Egypt traced their descent from those who went down to Egypt [with Jacob], because they considered them distinguished ancestors, and the others appointed for themselves heads of houses from those who were born there shortly after [Jacob’s descent to Egypt]. Therefore most of the [people] mentioned here [in this census as forming families] were [amongst] those who went down to Egypt [with Jacob], and therefore these families trace themselves back to those who came down [originally] to Egypt, because it was there that they established them [these people, as the heads of their family-groups]."

                    "AND THE NAME OF THE DAUGHTER OF ASHER WAS SERACH. “Because she was still alive [at the end of Israel’s period of bondage in Egypt, and after forty years in the desert, and was one of the seventy people mentioned in Genesis 46 who went down to Egypt with Jacob], Scripture mentions her here.” This is Rashi’s language. And Onkelos translated [the verse as follows]: “and the name of the daughter of Asher’s <i>wife</i>, was Serach.” By this he intended to say that she was a <i>daughter that possesseth an inheritance</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">83</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 36:8.</i> [in the Land in her own right], and therefore Scripture mentions her here just as it mentions the daughters of Zelophehad,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">84</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 27:7.</i> for she [Serach] is included amongst [those referred to in the verse], <i>Unto these the Land shall be divided</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">85</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 53.</i> Now had she been the daughter of Asher himself, she would not have inherited [a portion in the Land], since he had male children [as stated in Verse 44]. But she [Serach] was the daughter of his [Asher’s] wife from another man [namely Asher’s wife’s first husband], who did not have a son; therefore his inheritance [in the Land] passed to his daughter. In that case, the reason [why Scripture uses the phrase] <i>and Serach their sister</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">86</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 46:17. The verse reads: <i>And the sons of Asher: Imnah and Ishvah and Ishvi and Beriah and Serach their sister</i>. Ramban here is pointing out that the verse avoids calling her Asher’s daughter, and describes her especially as the sister of his sons, because she was in actual fact not his daughter at all, but only their half-sister.</i> is because she was a [half-]sister to Asher’s sons, but was not his daughter. And therefore it says [here], <i>And the name of the daughter of Asher was Serach</i>, and it does not say “and Asher’s daughter [was Serach],” because [the intention of the verse] is to say that her name was [i.e., she was known as] “Asher’s daughter,” and she was [actually] called Serach.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">87</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The meaning of the verse is thus: “<i>And the name of</i> the person known as <i>‘the daughter of Asher’ was Serach</i>.”</i> Now if she were still alive [at the end of the period of Israel’s sojourn in the desert], as Rashi explained, then she was like the daughters of Zelophehad as regards [receiving] an inheritance [in the Land in her own right], but if she had died [by then, Scripture mentions her here to indicate that] her family received [a portion in the Land] because of her [since she was amongst those who went down to Egypt].<br>According to the simple meaning of Scripture, Serach had a large family which was called by her name, and she is included in the phrase, <i>These are the families of the sons of Asher according to those that were numbered</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">88</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 47.</i> Scripture, however, did not want to trace their ancestry to a woman, by saying: “Of Serach, the family of the Serachites,” but instead alluded to this matter [briefly]."

And although the portions were [thus] not equal, since they divided [the Land] according to the size of the tribe, they did so only by means of the lot [as commanded in Verse 55], and the lot [assigned the portions] by means of <i>Ruach Hakodesh</i>. ”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">89</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“The Holy Spirit.” See above in <i>Seder Chukath</i>, Note 64.</i> This is Rashi’s language.<br>But the interpretation of our Rabbis about this verse is not so. Instead, they said in the Sifre:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">90</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifre <i>Pinchas</i> 132.</i> “<i>To the more thou shalt give the more inheritance</i>. Supposing somebody came out of Egypt with ten sons, and when they entered the Land they were [only] five etc. [we apply to this case the verse, <i>To the more thou shalt give the more inheritance;</i> if on the other hand he had five sons when he came out of Egypt, and when they entered the Land they were ten, we apply to them the verse, <i>and to the fewer thou shalt give the less inheritance</i>]. ”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">91</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, the division of the Land depended not on the number of people in each family <i>upon entering the Land</i>, but upon the number that the family had <i>when they left Egypt</i> — hence if they became fewer, we still apply the verse: <i>To the more</i> … since they were more when they left Egypt, and vice versa. It is thus obvious that the Sifre applied these verses to the division of the Land <i>among the fathers’ houses</i>, and not, as Rashi explained it, to the division between the twelve tribes as a whole.</i> And likewise it is explicitly stated in the Gemara<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">92</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Baba Bathra 117b.</i> that the meaning of [this section] according to the Sages was not to distinguish in any way between [the portion given to] each particular tribe [since they each received an equal portion], just as they have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">92</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Baba Bathra 117b.</i> “It is well-understood according to the Sage who says [that the Land was divided] according to [the numbers of] those who came out of Egypt, why Scripture states, <i>To the more thou shalt give the more inheritance</i> etc.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">93</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“For if a person came out of Egypt with ten sons, and by the time they entered the Land he only had five sons, we apply to him the verse, <i>To the more</i> etc. ; whereas if he had originally five sons etc. [as explained by Ramban above in the text]. But according to the Sage who says that the Land was divided according to the number of people at the time that they entered the Land, what is the meaning of the phrases: <i>to the more</i> and <i>to the fewer</i>, since each family received a share equal to its numbers at that time?” From this text, too, it is obvious that the Sages were not referring to differences between the portions of larger or smaller <i>tribes</i>, but instead applied this verse to the subsequent allocation of the land among the various families of each tribe.</i> Furthermore, I have already written in <i>Seder Vayechi Yaakov</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">94</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 48:6 (Vol. I, pp. 570-572).</i> that in the Gemara of the Chapter <i>Yesh Nochalin</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">95</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“There are some [near of kin] who inherit.” The text quoted here is in Baba Bathra 122a.</i> the Rabbis expressly came to the conclusion that the Land was <i>not</i> divided according to the heads of men, [i.e., according to the overall population], but it was divided among [all] the tribes [equally]. Thus they divided it into twelve equal parts, and each tribe took that part which was assigned to it by the lot. It was for this [reason] that the sons of Joseph complained about it, saying [to Joshua], <i>‘Why hast thou given me but one lot and one part for an inheritance, seeing I am a great people?’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 17:14.</i> However, Joshua did not give them any additional [land] at all [since each tribe received an equal share], but he told them, ‘[<i>If thou be a great people</i>], <i>get thee up to the forest, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim; since the hill-country of Ephraim is too narrow for thee</i>, ’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">97</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 15.</i> meaning to say that they should conquer for themselves that land [which had been assigned to them and] which they had not yet taken, and thereby they should extend their border.<br>This is [also the meaning of] that which Scripture says, <i>according to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit</i>. [<i>According to the lot shall their inheritance be divided</i>] <i>between the more and the fewer</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">98</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verses 55-56.</i> [That is to say], each of the tribes should take equally, whether it has a large population or a small one. And then the meaning of [the verse which says], <i>To the more thou shalt give the more inheritance, and the fewer thou shalt give the less inheritance</i>, [is not “to the <i>tribe</i> that is more populous you shall give more etc. but] to the members of the tribe itself [for each tribe received an equal portion; and therefore Scripture is saying here that when the tribe divides its portion amongst its individual families, it should give a larger portion to a family with more members etc.]. Or [the meaning of this phrase may be] according to its interpretation [by the Rabbis, as mentioned above],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">91</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, the division of the Land depended not on the number of people in each family <i>upon entering the Land</i>, but upon the number that the family had <i>when they left Egypt</i> — hence if they became fewer, we still apply the verse: <i>To the more</i> … since they were more when they left Egypt, and vice versa. It is thus obvious that the Sifre applied these verses to the division of the Land <i>among the fathers’ houses</i>, and not, as Rashi explained it, to the division between the twelve tribes as a whole.</i> that it [the Land] was divided according to [the numbers of] those who left Egypt. Thus supposing somebody came out of Egypt with ten sons, and when they entered the Land they were [only] five, we apply to this case the verse, <i>To the more thou shalt give the more inheritance</i>.” That is to say, if those ten sons who were twenty years old [or more] at the time that they left Egypt died, and they had five sons [born to them] in the desert, or if [five of the children] were minors [at the time of the exodus],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">99</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Divine decree that the generation of the wilderness was not to enter the Land (see above, 14:29-31) did not apply to those who were minors at the time of the exodus. Hence it was possible for those born in the desert, or were minors at the time of the exodus, to actually take possession of the Land.</i> and became twenty years of age [in the desert], we apply to such a case the verse, <i>To the more thou shalt give the more</i>, meaning: <i>to</i> those who were <i>more</i> at the time of leaving Egypt, <i>thou shalt give the more</i> [land], even though they are now fewer. “And supposing a person came out of Egypt with five sons, and at the time that they entered the Land they were ten, in that case we apply to him [the verse], <i>and to the fewer thou shalt give the less</i>, ”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">100</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Meaning: “<i>and to those who were fewer</i> at the time of the exodus from Egypt, <i>thou shalt give less</i> land, even though they are now, at the time of entering the Land, greater in population.”</i> as is stated in the Sifre [mentioned above].<br>However, I have seen there [in the Sifre<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">90</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifre <i>Pinchas</i> 132.</i> a text explaining our verse] which states [as follows]: “<i>To each one according to those that were numbered of it</i> [<i>shall its inheritance be given</i>]. This teaches us that the Land was only allocated amongst each tribe according to what it was [in population]. Thus it is said, <i>And the children of Joseph spoke unto Joshua, saying: ‘Why hast thou given me but one lot and one part for an inheritance, seeing I am a great people, forasmuch as the Eternal hath blessed me thus?’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 17:14.</i> What does it say [further]? <i>And Joshua said unto them: ‘If thou be a great people, get thee up to the forest, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim; since the hill-country of Ephraim is too narrow for thee. ’</i> ”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">97</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 15.</i> This is the language of this Beraitha.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">101</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Vol. II, p. 133, Note 209.</i> And it appears from it that the Land was indeed divided [amongst the twelve tribes themselves] according to the number of heads [i.e., according to their population], as the Rabbi [Rashi] has said! But according to the Gemara this [Beraitha] is rejected [as the final interpretation]. Furthermore, if it is so [as the Beraitha implies, that the Land was divided amongst the tribes themselves according to their relative populations], what did the children of Joseph complain about? Surely he [Joshua] gave them [a greater share] in proportion to their larger numbers, as [he gave] the other tribes [according to their relative sizes]!<br>In my opinion this Beraitha is a shortened text, and it is [in fact based] upon that which the Rabbis said in the Gemara<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">102</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Baba Bathra 118a.</i> that the children of Joseph complained because of their many [young] children. The explanation of the matter is [thus as follows]: The children of Joseph took [the amount of land which they deserved] as two tribes, the children of Ephraim one share, and the children of Menasheh another share, for so it is written,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">103</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 48:5: <i>As Reuben and Simeon, shall Ephraim and Menasheh be mine</i>.</i> and neither of their [two] tribes was larger in population than any of the other tribes. Indeed, some of the other tribes were more numerous than they were, for the tribes of Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, and Dan were [all] more populous than they were,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">104</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Judah numbered 76,500 (Verse 22); Issacher 64,300 (Verse 25); Zebulun 60,500 (Verse 27); Dan 64,400 (Verse 43). Thus they were each larger than the tribe of Ephraim, who were only 32,500 (Verse 37), or that of Menasheh, who were 52,700. It is therefore evident that the tribe of Ephraim did not complain merely because they were a large tribe.</i> so why [therefore] should they have complained whilst the more numerous ones remained quiet? This [question] applies with even greater force if the Land was divided according to [the number of] those who came out of Egypt, according to the interpretation [of the Sifre quoted above], because the sons of Judah at the [time of the] first census were more numerous than these two tribes [Ephraim and Menasheh] put together!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">105</sup><i class=\"footnote\">At the time of the first census, Judah numbered 74,600 (above, 1:27), whereas Ephraim and Menasheh together were only 72,700 (<i>ibid.</i>, Verses 33 and 35). Thus the tribe of Judah had far greater cause to complain than Ephraim or Menasheh.</i> Therefore [we must rather say that] they complained because of their children, for the sons of Menasheh in the [first] census [taken at the time] of the exodus from Egypt totalled thirty-two thousand [and two hundred],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">106</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 1:35.</i> whereas they had increased by the [time of the] second census [taken] in the desert to fifty-two thousand [and seven hundred]!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">107</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 34 here. Thus they increased by 20,500.</i> None of the [other] tribes increased to such an extent. And they [the tribe of Menasheh] continued to increase in population until the [time of the] division of the Land [in the days of Joshua],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">108</sup><i class=\"footnote\">From the time of this second census [taken in the fortieth year of Israel’s stay in the desert] until the actual <i>beginning</i> of the division of the Land by Joshua, there was a period of something over seven years, since tradition assigns a period of seven years for the conquest of the Land, and seven years for its division. In the meantime, naturally, the sons of Menasheh continued to increase.</i> and this also happened in the case of the children of Ephraim.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">109</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This text is difficult to understand, because in fact the children of Ephraim <i>decreased</i> in numbers between the first census at the time of the exodus from Egypt and the second census here! [In the first census they totalled 40,500 (Above, 1:33), and in the second census 32,500 (Verse 37 here)]. A suggestion has been made [by Kur Zahav] that Ramban’s meaning is as follows: Since Scripture says that it were <i>the children of ‘Joseph’</i> who complained [a term which of course comprises the tribes of both Ephraim and Menasheh], it shows that the children of Ephraim also had increased between the time of the second census and the division of the Land, although they had decreased between the time of the first census at the exodus and the second census now. This interpretation is supported by a close reading of the text of Ramban here, who wrote: “[the tribe of Menasheh] continued to increase in population until the [time of the] division of the Land,” and <i>then</i> added: “and this also happened in the case of the children of Ephraim.” See also my Hebrew commentary, p. 312.</i> Now since these children received no share [in the Land], therefore [the children of Joseph] complained, but <i>there</i> was <i>no man to hear</i> them,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">110</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See II Samuel 15:3.</i> for such was the law — that only those who were above twenty years of age received a share in the Land.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">111</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See above, Verses 2 and 53.</i> Therefore the Beraitha [quoted above] is saying: “<i>According to those that were numbered</i> — who were twenty years old and over. This teaches us that the Land was only allocated amongst each tribe according to what it was [in population] at the time of the census, meaning that they were not to give anything to the children, even if they had grown up and reached the age of twenty at the time that they divided [the Land].<br>Now the verse stating [that the children of Joseph complained to Joshua, saying]: <i>Why hast thou given me but one lot and one part for an inheritance, seeing I am a great people</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 17:14.</i> cannot, as all must agree, be understood as would appear from its literal meaning. For if he [Joshua] divided the Land amongst them [the twelve tribes] according to the number of people [in each tribe], as Rashi explained, then they [the children of Joseph] must have taken their fair share, for according to their greater population, [in the same proportion] they took a larger portion [in the Land]. And if [the Land was divided] according to the [number of] tribes [so that each tribe received an equal part], it is impossible that Joshua should not have given them their share of the birthright, for he would not have transgressed the testament of Jacob!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">112</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 48:5. In other words, it is inconceivable that Joshua should violate Jacob’s command that Joseph’s two sons, Ephraim and Menasheh, should be treated as separate tribes and each receive the same share in the Land that all the other tribes received, instead of treating them as merely one tribe [of Joseph], so that they would together receive only one share. Since this is inconceivable, why then did the children of Joseph complain, for they must have received the extra portion due to them as the birthright which had been taken away from Reuben!</i> And the Holy One, blessed be He, also commanded likewise in the Torah, [mentioning] the tribes of Ephraim and Menasheh [separately, amongst those who were to take possession of the Land].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">113</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 34:23-24.</i> Moreover, it is expressly written that he [Joshua] gave them [the children of Joseph] two lots, as it is said, <i>And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was thus;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">114</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 16:5 and 8.</i> <i>This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">114</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 16:5 and 8.</i> And [with reference to] the children of Menasheh [it is said], <i>And this was the lot for the tribe of Menasheh;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">115</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 17:1.</i> <i>And the border of Menasheh was</i> etc.,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">116</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 7.</i> just as it is said in the case of [all] the other tribes. But in saying: [<i>Why hast thou given me but</i>] <i>one lot and one part</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 17:14.</i> they meant to say: “All that you [Joshua] have given the two of us together, each one [of us] deserves to get as his [own] lot.” They used this expression because Joshua at first cast [only] one lot for both of them, as it is said, <i>And the lot for ‘the children of Joseph’ went out from the Jordan at Jericho</i> etc.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">117</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 16:1.</i> until: <i>the goings out thereof were at the sea</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">118</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 3.</i> And there it is stated, <i>And the children of Joseph, Menasheh and Ephraim, took their inheritance</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">119</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 4.</i> meaning to say that they both <i>took their inheritance</i> by means of this [one] lot, and afterwards he divided this portion amongst the two of them by [a further] lot, as it is said there, <i>And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was thus</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">120</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 5.</i> and it is [further] written, <i>And this was the lot for the tribe of Menasheh</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">115</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 17:1.</i> Therefore they [the children of Joseph] said to Joshua: “Behold, this single first lot [which you drew for the two of us before you further subdivided it], each one of us deserves to get, since we are <i>a great people</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 17:14.</i> and why [therefore] did you subdivide it afterwards into two parts?” And the [reason for this] complaint, according to the explanation of the Gemara,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">102</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Baba Bathra 118a.</i> was because of their children who increased greatly amongst them.<br>And according to the simple meaning of Scripture, it seems to me that this complaint [to Joshua by the children of Joseph] was that of the children of Menasheh [only, and not that of the children of Ephraim], but the two tribes came to him together. Similarly, <i>Then the children of Judah drew nigh unto Joshua in Gilgal, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizite said unto him</i> etc.,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">121</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 14:6.</i> for that case [affected only] one person, and yet the whole tribe came to join him in his complaint. And the [particular] grievance of the children of Menasheh was because none of the other tribes had left many great cities in the hands of the Canaanites, as had Menasheh, who left [unconquered] <i>the three regions</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">122</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 17:11.</i> [which Yonathan translated] “three districts.” A proof for this [explanation of the cause of their grievance] is that it is after it says, <i>And the children of Menasheh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">123</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 12.</i> that it is written: <i>And the children of Joseph spoke</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 17:14.</i> for at first they did not complain, until they had waged war against them and they were not able to prevail over them. It is possible that this is the meaning of [the expression] <i>one lot and one part</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 17:14.</i> They said: “Because you cast originally one lot for both of us [Ephraim and Menasheh], our portion [in the Land] came together, and so it happened that both of our portions were [allocated] in this place which is difficult to capture but had you cast two lots for us, as was done for all other [separate] tribes, our portion might have been allocated in a place which is easier to conquer.” And Joshua replied [to this claim by saying] that if they go up to the forest <i>of the Perizzites and the Rephaim</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">97</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 15.</i> they will be able to select for themselves from there whatever they want, and thus extend their borders.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">97</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 15.</i> Then they [the children of Joseph] spoke up and explained their [original] grievance, saying, “<i>The hill-country will</i> also <i>not be enough for us</i>, for <i>all the Canaanites</i> that you have given us <i>in the land of the valley have chariots of iron</i>. ”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">124</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 16.</i> Then Joshua told them that he would not give them in the mountain <i>one lot only</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">125</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 17.</i> <i>but the</i> whole of the <i>hill-country shall be</i> theirs together with the large <i>forest</i> which is there,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">126</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 18.</i> and they should choose for themselves as much as they need from those [lands], and they shall have all <i>the goings out</i> of the borders of the hill-country. And [he further told them that] they would <i>drive out the Canaanites</i> from there <i>though they have chariots of iron, and though they be strong</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">126</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 18.</i> as a result of which none of the other tribes wanted it [that land], but they, the two brothers, who are <i>a numerous people and have great power</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">125</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 17.</i> will [be able to] help each other to <i>drive</i> them [the Canaanites] <i>out</i>. The end of the matter was that Joshua did not listen to them and did not add anything to their portion, for such was the law [that they get in the same proportion as all the other tribes]. We have written at length on this subject, because of the necessity [to clarify this matter fully] and we have furthermore written about it, with proofs, in the section of <i>Vayechi Yaakov</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">94</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 48:6 (Vol. I, pp. 570-572).</i><br>The general principle thus is that the law which [the Rabbis] reached as a conclusion in the Gemara<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">95</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“There are some [near of kin] who inherit.” The text quoted here is in Baba Bathra 122a.</i> [that the Land was divided amongst the twelve tribes into twelve equal parts] is true, and that is the proper basis on which to explain the verses. Thus the meaning of the section [before us] is as follows: <i>Unto these</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">127</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 53.</i> who are mentioned according to their families <i>the Land shall be divided</i> [<i>for an inheritance</i>] <i>according to the number of names</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">127</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 53.</i> giving each male person, according to their number, his share. <i>To the more</i> ye <i>shall give the more inheritance</i> — thus for example they are to divide the land of Reuben into four parts [because the tribe consisted of four main families],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">128</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi (above, Verses 5-6).</i> and “we will give to <i>the family of the Hanochites</i>, for example, who were the largest [in population], a greater <i>inheritance</i>, and to <i>the family of the Palluites</i>, [for example], who were the least populous, we will give a smaller share, for <i>to each one according to those that were numbered of</i> the [particular] family <i>shall its inheritance be given</i>, and the whole family shall receive its share in one place.” It was for this reason that He [commanded here] that they should be counted according to their families. Therefore the Sages mentioned [with reference to the law of the Seventh year]:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">129</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, beginning of <i>Seder Behar</i>.</i> “If they divided the land [of a tribe] amongst its [main] families, but did not [yet] subdivide it amongst the houses of the families, and each individual does not yet know what his share is … etc.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">130</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“… I might think that the law of the Seventh year applies. For this reason Scripture states, <i>thou shalt not sow ‘thy’ field</i> (Leviticus 25:4) [using the singular, to indicate that] the law applies only when each person recognizes his own field.”</i>"
                ],
                [
                    "HOWEVER, THE LAND SHALL BE DIVIDED BY LOT amongst the tribes of Israel, and ACCORDING TO THE NAMES OF THE TRIBES OF THEIR FATHERS who constituted twelve tribes THEY SHALL INHERIT them [i.e., the twelve equal portions of the Land]. And then He repeated: 56. ACCORDING TO THE LOT SHALL THE INHERITANCE of the tribe BE DIVIDED BETWEEN THE MORE AND THE FEWER, meaning that they should also cast lots amongst the [individual] families, so that [for instance] the portion of the Hanochites should be in the direction and place which the lot chooses for him, and the portion of the Palluites should be in the place which the lot chooses for him, but we are to allot more [of the land] to the larger [families], and give less to the smaller families. This is the meaning of that which it says in the section<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">131</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “In the book of” <i>Eileh Mas’ei</i>.</i> of <i>Eileh Mas’ei: And ye shall inherit the land by lot according to your families — to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer thou shalt give the less inheritance; wheresoever the lot falleth to any man, that shall be his; according to the tribes of your fathers shall ye inherit</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">132</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 33:54.</i> Thus He explained that the inheritance should be allotted to families by the lot, and in whichever direction the lot chooses for him [any individual family], there we shall give a larger [portion] to the larger of the families and a smaller [portion] to the smaller [families]. He [furthermore] said that it [the division of the Land] should be <i>according to the tribes of your fathers</i>, meaning to say twelve tribes.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">133</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus it is clear that the Land was initially divided into twelve equal parts, so that each tribe was allocated an equal share of the Land, and the lot also determined the location of each tribe’s portion. Subsequently each tribe subdivided the land which it had received, amongst its individual families, and this division was made in proportion to the number of members of each particular family. This division too, was by means of a lot which determined the direction and location of each family’s inheritance.</i><br>Now that which Rashi said — “<i>According to the names of ‘matoth’ of their fathers</i>, this means those who came out of Egypt” — is not correct, for the term <i>matoth</i> always means “the tribes” of Israel, just as it is written, <i>So shall no inheritance remove ‘mimateh’</i> (<i>from one tribe</i>) <i>‘l’mateih acheir’</i> (<i>to another tribe</i>)<i>; for ‘matoth’</i> (<i>the tribes of</i>) <i>the children of Israel shall cleave each one to its own inheritance</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">134</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 36:9.</i> Similarly [it is written], <i>a thousand ‘l’mateh’</i> (<i>of every tribe</i>) <i>throughout all ‘matoth’</i> (<i>tribes of</i>) <i>Israel</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">135</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 31:4.</i> and so also in the case of the spies,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">136</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 13:2: <i>‘l’mateih’</i> (<i>of every tribe</i>) <i>of their fathers</i>.</i> and likewise in all other places — for the terms <i>sheivet</i> and <i>mateh</i> are identical.

Why did Scripture count here in [Verse 57, speaking of] the Levites, the families of the three ancestors [Gershon, Kohath, and Merari — the three sons of the Levites mentioned above, 3:17], and then again count [in Verse 58] the families of their sons [mentioning amongst them: <i>the family of the Machlites, the family of the Mushites</i>, who were both sons of Merari],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">145</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 19.</i> since Merari had no other children except Machli and Mushi,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">145</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 19.</i> and for what then <i>is the family of the Merarites</i> [mentioned here in Verse 57, seeing that both his children, Machli and Mushi, are counted in Verse 58 as separate families], and there were no other [children of Merari] apart from them! But [we must say that Scripture mentioned each of the three families of the three sons of Levi here in Verse 57] as [a sign of] honor, since all three sons of Levi were great men in Israel, and their memories were a blessing. Therefore all the descendants of Gershon [the first son of Levi] were called <i>the family of the Gershonites</i> in his honor, and similarly all the children of Merari [his third son] were called <i>the family of the Merarites</i> in his honor [as mentioned here in Verse 57]. And afterwards they appointed for themselves paternal families, and became divided up into [smaller] families as did the other tribes, and were called by particular names, [such as] <i>the family of the Machlites</i> and <i>the family of the Mushites</i> [in Verse 58]. Similarly in the case of Kohath [the second son of Levi] all his children were included in [the term] <i>the family of the Kohathites</i> [in Verse 57], and continued to divide themselves up further into [smaller] families of [his] children — <i>the family of the Hebronites</i>, and <i>the family of the Korachites</i> [in Verse 58]. And Scripture did not mention here [in Verse 58] “the family of the Amramites,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">146</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As it did above, 3:27: <i>And of Kohath was the family of the Amramites</i> …</i> because it was divided up into priests and Levites, and it mentioned their [individual] names [Aaron and Moses — in Verse 59] in [their] honor. However, it did not mention [in that verse Aaron’s] priesthood, because of the honor of Moses [i.e., since Moses was <i>not</i> the High Priest, but remained a Levite, Scripture in his honor did not want here to emphasize that Aaron was “the priest”]. Similarly you will see in the first census [taken in the second year after the exodus] when counting [the Levites], that Scripture states, <i>And these were the sons of Levi, by their names: Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari</i>, [stating all their names] because of their individual distinction, for in [the case of] the other tribes it does not mention them in this way [i.e., it does not mention any individual names].<br>And the reason [why Scripture mentions in Verse 58] <i>the family of the Korachites</i> [and does not mention <i>‘the family of the Itzharites,’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">143</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 27.</i> which would have included the other two sons of Itzhar apart from Korach, i.e., Nepheg, and Zichri]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">144</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 6:21: <i>And the sons of Itzhar: Korach, and Nepheg, and Zichri</i>. Now <i>the family of the Korachites</i> is mentioned here in Verse 58, but <i>Nepheg and Zichri</i> are omitted. This is the meaning of Rashi’s statement that “part of the Itzharites are missing here.”</i> is because it was originally called <i>the family of the Itzharites</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">143</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 27.</i> since at [the time of] that [first] census Nepheg and Zichri also had children, [hence <i>the family of the Itzharites</i> included Itzhar’s three sons, <i>Korach, and Nepheg, and Zichri</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">144</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 6:21: <i>And the sons of Itzhar: Korach, and Nepheg, and Zichri</i>.

This is the meaning of Rashi’s statement that “part of the Itzharites are missing here.”</i> and their descendants]. Now, however, [at the time of this second census] only Korach had children, and therefore they were called after his name [<i>the family of the Korachites</i>, here in Verse 58]. However, in my opinion, it was not right that the name of <i>the Itzharites</i> should be completely removed from his offspring, even though some of his [Itzhar’s] children had died; but they did this after the incident of [the rebellion of] Korach because of the honor of Korach’s sons[who originally joined their father’s revolt against Moses, but subsequently repented], in order to publicize in Israel their name and their memory in all future generations. For likewise [we see that] Scripture makes a point of saying, <i>But the children of Korach died not</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">147</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 11.</i> [in order to emphasize that they turned aside from their father’s evil ways]. And since Nepheg and Zichri had come to an end [because all their children died], and all the descendants of Itzhar [that] remained [were] Korach’s, they called them <i>the family of the Korachites</i> [here in Verse 58], in order to publicize [the fact] that this [Korach’s] children were <i>more righteous and better than he</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">148</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Kings 2:32.</i> And the Midrash of Rabbi Moshe the Preacher on the verse, <i>ye are ‘hame’at’</i> (<i>the fewest</i>) <i>of all peoples</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">149</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 7:7. Since it could have said: “<i>ye are ‘me’at’ of all peoples</i>” instead of <i>‘hame’at’</i>, Rabbi Moshe the Preacher explained it as an allusion to the fact that the Israelites numbered sixty-five families, five less than the families of the traditional seventy nations of the world. The verse thus means: “you are ‘<i>hei</i> [which is the Hebrew number five] less’ than all the peoples.” Now Rabbi Moshe the Preacher arrived at this figure of sixty-five by counting fifty-seven families amongst all the other tribes [as mentioned here in Verses 5-49], and eight families of Levites [as mentioned here in Verses 57-58]. — To this Ramban objects, since, as explained above, the three mentioned in Verse 57 are <i>not</i> separate families, but are merely mentioned as a sign of honor to the three distinguished sons of Levi. Hence there are only <i>five</i> separate families of the Levites [as mentioned in Verse 58], so that the total together with the fifty-seven of the Israelites is only sixty-three! Consequently the whole interpretation of the verse, <i>ye are ‘hame’at’ of all the peoples</i> by Rabbi Moshe the Preacher, is not true — since there were not sixty-five families, but only sixty-three.</i> — that [you are] less [than all peoples] by <i>‘hei,’</i> is not true — because Scripture counts [here] eight [families] for the children of Levi [in Verses 57-58], but they were only five — [those mentioned in Verse 58], for the three mentioned [in Verse 57] were the fathers [of these five, and thus cannot be counted as separate families], as we have explained."

And furthermore, the [primary law of] inheritance is [that it follows the direct] line of [descent of] successors [of the progenitor] according to his [direct] descendants, and does not go by means of a side-succession [such as to a brother; hence the father gets it back from his son].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">164</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Baba Bathra 115a.</i> If so [the meaning of the verse] <i>then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren</i> is the inheritance which the father inherits in the grave [in a direct line back from his son]; and from him [the father, who is already dead], it comes [again in a direct line] to the brothers [who survive the deceased son].

[Accept this position of leadership over them with full awareness of this and] on condition that you take upon yourself [all this].’” This is the language of Rashi. But it is not correct in my opinion, because it says [<i>and thou shalt command him</i>] <i>before their eyes</i> [and Moses would not have told Joshua to say such words in their presence], for this matter ought rather to have been told to him [Joshua] between the two of them [Moses and Joshua]; for if he would say it in their presence, it would [only] have caused them to break off all restraint. And it would have been more fitting that he [Moses] should chastise the people, warning them separately [and not in Joshua’s presence] not to be troublesome and stubborn any more [rather than to tell Joshua, in their presence, that they were a troublesome and stubborn people]! But [the meaning of] <i>and thou shalt command him before their eyes</i> is that you should instruct him in the duties of a prince and judge, since it was because he [Joshua] was to be their leader that he entrusted them to his care. [Therefore] he should [indeed] have warned him to exert himself exceedingly on their behalf, and to fight the battles of the Eternal, and that he should be the one to <i>go out before them</i> [in battle] and to <i>bring them in</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">174</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 17.</i> and that he should be careful in matters of judgment. These [instructions] indeed ought to be said in their presence, in order that they should trust him and listen to him, for they would then know that he will treat their affairs in a truthful manner, since his master had so commanded him. And this is what Moses [actually] did, as it is said there, <i>And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all Israel: ‘Be strong and of good courage etc. fear not, neither be dismayed.’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">172</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 31:7-8.</i> And in the Sifre [we find the following text]:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">175</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I have not found this exact text in our editions of Sifre.

Since the lamb had to be bought on the tenth of that month (<i>ibid.</i>, Verse 3), the verse implies that it has to be carefully examined for a blemish for four days before it is slaughtered. Since here, in speaking of the Daily Whole-offering, Scripture likewise uses the term <i>shmirah</i> [— <i>‘tishmeru’</i> (<i>ye shall keep</i>)], we deduce that it also has to be examined for four days before it is slaughtered</i> just as there the offering requires observation [so that no blemish should be found in it] for [a period of] four days before it is slaughtered, so here too etc.” [See] the whole interpretation, as it is stated in the Sifre.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">186</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifre, <i>Pinchas</i> 142.</i><br>By way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], the verse also hints to the following: It states <i>My offering, My bread ‘l’ishai’</i> — of <i>‘ishai’</i> (My Divine powers) — <i>ye shall keep</i> and be careful <i>to offer unto Me</i> to My Name, <i>in its due season.

The reason for this is that although in the section [dealing with] the drink-offerings<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">199</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 15:4-12.</i> He commanded how much the meal-offerings and the drink-offerings should be <i>for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">200</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 29:33.</i> in vow-offerings, freewill offerings, and [the offerings of] the festivals,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">201</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 15:3.</i> we find a double meal-offering for the lamb brought with the sheaf [of barley],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">202</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 23:13.</i> and on the day of <i>Atzereth</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">203</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the Festival of Weeks.

Instead Moses said it <i>to</i> all <i>the children of Israel</i> together, <i>according to all that the Eternal commanded Moses</i>, including the laws of refraining from work on the festivals,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">223</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 28:18, 26. etc.</i> and [the laws of] the Daily Whole-offerings, the Additional Offerings, the vow-offerings and the freewill offerings, for thus it was told to Moses, <i>Command the children of Israel</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">224</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 2.</i> And the reason [for this] is because this commandment applies after they enter the Land, and it is a commandment to all Israel to observe [the laws of] the Daily Whole-offerings and the Additional Offerings [of the Sabbath and festivals] in their appointed times, and to bring their vow-offerings and freewill offerings. Furthermore, the main intention of the commandment [to offer up offerings] is that <i>these days should be remembered and kept</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">225</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Esther 9:28.</i> and to refrain on them from all servile work [and therefore it was told <i>to</i> all <i>the children of Israel</i>].

For it says there at the beginning, <i>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">226</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 23:2.</i> and at the end it says, <i>And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the appointed seasons of the Eternal</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">222</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 23:44.</i> and here likewise at the beginning [of the section it says], <i>Command the children of Israel, and say unto them</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">224</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 2.</i> and at the end [in the verse before us] it says, <i>And Moses told the children of Israel according to all that the Eternal commanded</i>. It did not mention [here in this verse that Moses told] “the appointed seasons of the Eternal,” because in this section here other matters are mentioned [as well] which do not apply to “the appointed seasons of the Eternal,” such as the Daily Whole-offerings of weekdays, and the Additional Offerings of the Sabbath and the New Moons.<br>The interpretation given by Rabbi Yishmael [quoted above by Rashi] is because Scripture never has to say of Moses that he told the children of Israel all that G-d commanded him, [because it is self-understood that he always did so], and it is not usual for the Torah to say so at each and every section. Therefore the Rabbis [similarly] explained<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">227</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 3:12.</i> the verse, “<i>And Moses spoke unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">221</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 21:24.</i> — [as implying that] he warned Aaron about his sons [i.e., that Aaron as High Priest should preserve the sanctity of the Sanctuary, and prevent priests with a bodily blemish from performing the Divine Service], and [he warned] the sons concerning the Israelites [that they should prevent the Israelites from entering those parts of the Sanctuary which are forbidden to them], and [he warned] the Israelites about each other” [that they should each prevent the other from violating the sanctity of the Sanctuary]. And in the section of the festivals they explained [the verse, <i>And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the appointed seasons of the Eternal</i>]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">222</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 23:44.</i> in many ways. [Thus they said]:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">228</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 17:12-13.</i> “This teaches us that Moses used to tell Israel the laws of the Passover on Passover, the laws of Shavuoth [the Festival of Weeks] on Shavuoth, and the laws of Tabernacles on Tabernacles. [It further teaches us that] in the very language that he heard it [from G-d], he told it to Israel. And all the sections [mentioned here] are subject to the same law.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">229</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This means, as explained further, that just as fixing the days of the festivals [through the sanctification of the New Moon] can only be performed by a qualified court (see Vol. II, p. 116) so the adjudication of vows [mentioned in the following section] requires a court of qualified experts. Hence the statement: “All sections [mentioned here — namely the preceding one dealing with the festivals, and the following one treating of vows], are subject to the same law.”</i> Rabbi Yosei the Galilean says: It states [<i>and Moses declared unto the children of Israel</i>] <i>the appointed seasons of the Eternal</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">222</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 23:44.</i> but the Sabbath of Creation [i.e., the weekly Sabbath] was not said together with them.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">230</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This means that the Sabbath, unlike the festivals, does not require “sanctification” by the court, since its sanctity is permanent and endures forever, being based on its original sanctification by G-d at the creation of the world (Genesis 2:3).</i> Ben Azai says: It is said, [<i>And Moses declared unto the children of Israel</i>] <i>the appointed seasons of the Eternal</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">222</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 23:44.</i> but the section of vows was not said together with them [as will be explained further on]. Rabbi<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">231</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is Rabbi Yehudah Hanasi, the redactor of the Mishnah. Because of his great status, he is known simply as “Rabbi.” See also Vol. II, p. 349, Note 64.</i> says: What does this verse — <i>And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the appointed seasons of the Eternal</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">222</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 23:44.</i> — come to tell us? Since [hitherto] we have only learnt that the Paschal-lamb and the Daily Whole-offering override the Sabbath [i.e., are brought on the Sabbath although they entail doing work which is normally forbidden], because it says about them <i>in its appointed season</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">232</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 9:2 (Paschal-lamb). <i>Ibid.</i>, 28:2 (Daily Whole-offering).</i> [which includes even the Sabbath]; but we have not [yet] been taught that [the same applies to] the other public offerings. Therefore Scripture says: <i>These ye shall offer unto the Eternal ‘in your appointed seasons’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">233</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 29:39.</i> thus indicating that all public offerings mentioned in this section of the Additional Offerings of the festivals, override the Sabbath. [But we still do not know that the sheaf [of new barley brought on the second day of Passover], and the offerings brought with it,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">234</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 23:12-13.</i> and the two loaves [brought on the Festival of Shavuoth] and the offerings that come with them<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">235</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 17-18.</i> [override the Sabbath, since they are not mentioned in this section of the offerings, and hence are not included in the phrase <i>in your appointed seasons</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">233</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 29:39.</i> But when Scripture says [there], <i>And Moses declared unto the children of Israel ‘the appointed seasons of the Eternal,’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">222</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 23:44.</i> it established ‘an appointed season’ for all [public offerings, so that they all override the Sabbath].” Thus far is the text of the Torath Kohanim.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">228</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 17:12-13.</i><br>Now it is possible to say that the interpretation of Rabbi Yishmael who said that [the verse before us: <i>And Moses told the children of Israel</i> … is said] in order to separate the subject [of the offerings from that of the vows, as Rashi mentioned], is identical with that of Ben Azai, who said: “It says <i>the appointed seasons of the Eternal</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">222</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 23:44.</i> but the section of vows was not said together with them,” meaning that the law of the festivals is not like the law of the section of vows, which was told <i>to the heads of the tribes</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">236</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 30:2.</i> in order to say that a single person who is expert [in the laws] can release a vow, and so can three ordinary people, for the festivals require the sanctification [of the New Moon] by a court of [at least] three experts, as is explained in [Tractate] Baba Bathra.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">237</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Baba Bathra 121a.</i> Ben Azai thus derived this distinction between them [the festivals and vows] from the limiting phrase: [<i>And Moses declared</i>] <i>the appointed seasons of the Eternal</i>, and Rabbi Yishmael derived this [same] principle from the [apparent] redundancy of this verse [before us], and [hence he explained] that it only comes to separate the subject of the festivals from that of the vows. Thus both of them [Ben Azai and Rabbi Yishmael] are saying the same thing, differing only as to the text from which this law is derived.<br>The correct interpretation [of the words of Rabbi Yishmael who said that our verse comes only to separate the subjects] appears to me to be that he only intended to say [as follows]: Had He finished the section [here] of the festivals with [the verse]<i>: These ye shall offer unto the Eternal in your appointed seasons</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">233</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 29:39.</i> and begun [immediately with the verse] <i>And Moses spoke unto the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel, saying: This is the thing which the Eternal hath commanded</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">236</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 30:2.</i> it would have been possible [to explain] that the verse refers to the previous [subject], meaning that <i>Moses spoke unto the heads of the tribes:</i> “<i>This is the thing which G-d commanded</i> concerning the Daily Whole-offerings and the Additional Offerings” mentioned [previously], and the phrase <i>unto the heads of the tribes</i> would not be interpreted as referring to the following section of the vows. Therefore He divided [the subjects] and finished the section of the festivals [with the verse before us], <i>And Moses told the children of Israel according to all that the Eternal commanded Moses</i>, and then began the section of vows [with the statement] that Moses <i>spoke unto the heads of the tribes, This is the thing that the Eternal hath commanded</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">236</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 30:2.</i> This is the truth, for such is the explanation of [the expression] “to separate the subject” in many places in the Sifra and Sifre. And Rashi himself has already mentioned<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">238</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 31:17.</i> what the Rabbis have said in the Sifre:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">239</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifre, <i>Matoth</i> 157.</i> “[<i>Now therefore kill every male among the little ones</i>,] <i>‘and kill’</i> [<i>every woman that hath known man by lying with him</i>].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">238</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 31:17.</i> Why is [the expression]<i>and kill</i> used [since it has already been said once at the beginning of the verse]? It is to separate the subject. These are the words of Rabbi Yishmael. For if I were to read [the verse without the repetition of the expression ‘and kill,’ namely]<i>: ‘Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and every woman that hath known man by lying with him. And all the women-children …</i> [<i>keep alive</i>], I would not know what the verse is saying [about <i>the women</i> who <i>have known man by lying with him</i> — whether they are to be killed together with <i>every male</i> mentioned in the beginning of the verse, or to be kept alive together with <i>all the women-children</i> mentioned in the following verse]. Therefore it says [again], <i>and kill</i>, in order to separate the subject [from the following verse].’ These are the words of Rabbi Yishmael.” Similarly we find [such a usage of the expression “to separate the subject”] in other places in the Torath Kohanim [i.e., the Sifra].<br>Matoth"

                    "AND MOSES SPOKE UNTO THE HEADS OF THE TRIBES. Scripture did not precede this section with [the statement]: “And the Eternal spoke unto Moses, saying: Speak unto the heads of the tribes, and say unto them: This is the thing which the Eternal hath commanded,” as He stated in the section [dealing with] slaughtering [offerings] outside the Sanctuary Court,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 17:2.</i> and in other sections. Instead, He mentioned it as the <i>end</i> of this section, saying, <i>These are the statutes, which the Eternal commanded Moses</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 17.</i> And in the section of <i>Vayehi Bayom Ha’shemini</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 9:1.</i> it says: <i>And Moses said: ‘This is the thing which the Eternal commanded that ye should do</i>,’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 6. See also Ramban <i>ibid.</i> Verse 2.</i> but did not mention the [actual] command [given by G-d to Moses] at all.

It is possible that they [<i>the heads of the tribes</i> referred to here] were those who are mentioned in the section [dealing with] the inheritance [of the Land]: <i>These are the names of the men that shall take possession of the Land for you;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 34:17.</i> or it may be that those [referred to here] were others, for there Scripture speaks about [the leaders of] the future [saying] that when they come to divide up the Land [in the time of Joshua] all those mentioned will be living, and they will represent them [in the apportionment of the Land].<br><i>And Moses spoke unto the heads of the tribes</i>. The reason [why he did not address this section to the entire people] is because it was not necessary to teach all the children of Israel that the father and husband [of a woman] can declare void those vows [of their daughter or wife, respectively] which involve affliction of the soul, and perhaps it is [even] necessary to conceal these [rights] from them, so that they should not treat vows lightly. But it was to the Sages of Israel, the heads of their tribes, that he taught the ordinance [of vows]. The verse also alludes to the interpretation of our Rabbis<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nedarim 78a.</i> [who said] that the <i>heads of the tribes</i> have a special function and power in vows over and above the rest of the people, namely, that a single person who is an expert in the laws can release a person from a vow [and therefore, this section was addressed to the heads of the tribes, i.e., the Sages].<br>Now the [power of] release from vows [by a Sage] is not expressly stated in the Torah, but it is a law declared to Moses on Sinai, and Scripture “hung it on a hair’s-breadth,” just as the Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chagigah 10a. Now although these rules concerning the release from vows by a Sage “have nothing [in Scripture itself] on which they can be based,” they are yet on an absolute par with those laws which do have support in Scripture, as “they are all the essentials of the Torah” (<i>ibid.</i>, 11b).</i> “[The rules concerning] the release from vows [by a Sage] hover in the air, and have nothing [in Scripture itself] on which they can be based.” But Scripture did allude to it [by saying]: <i>‘lo yacheil’</i> (<i>he shall not profane</i>) <i>his word</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 3.</i> For it did not say: “he shall not <i>transgress</i> his word.” but commanded that he should not make “profane” his word, meaning that he should not treat the vow as a hollow [and irreverent] thing; and when he comes to the court and they find him a cause for absolution<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus, for example, if a man vows or swears that he will divorce his wife, the court may say to him: “Had you known that people would say about you: ‘Such is the nature of this person to divorce his wife,’ and that they will say about your daughters: ‘They are the daughters of a divorced woman! What did her mother do that she was divorced?’ [Had you known all this], would you then have made your vow?” If he says, “Had I known this I would not have made my vow,” they may release him from his vow (Nedarim 66a). See also Note 44 further on.</i> and he regrets [having made the vow], and they release him thereof, he is not profaning it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chagigah 10a. Now although these rules concerning the release from vows by a Sage “have nothing [in Scripture itself] on which they can be based,” they are yet on an absolute par with those laws which do have support in Scripture, as “they are all the essentials of the Torah” (<i>ibid.</i>, 11b).</i> And the reason for this [law being indicated in this manner of allusion] is as I have said [above], that Scripture treated absolution from a vow or oath as if it were one of the secrets of the Torah which are only to be revealed to those who are fit to [hear] them, and therefore they are written [in the Torah] in allusion. And this section [of vows] is placed here [in the Torah] because since [in the section above] He mentioned vows to the Sanctuary, [as it is said], <i>beside your vows, and your freewill offerings, whether they be your burnt-offerings, or your meal-offerings, or your drink-offerings, or your peace-offerings</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 29:39.</i> therefore He said furthermore: “Apart from these above-mentioned vows, there are also vows of a secular nature. [In the case of these vows, too], <i>according to all that proceedeth out of</i> a man’s <i>mouth</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 3.</i> he is obliged to fulfill, and to do all with which he bound his soul; for in [the case of] all vows [whether of a holy or secular nature] <i>he shall not profane his word</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 3.</i> but others may absolve it for him” [by finding him a cause for absolution, as explained above]."

                    "IF A MAN ‘YIDOR NEDER’ (VOWETH A VOW). “[This means if] a person says: ‘May there be <i>konam</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word <i>konam</i> is a substitute for <i>korban</i> (offering), and is used for a vow of abstinence, meaning, “May this object be forbidden to me in the same way as it is forbidden to have any benefit from a holy offering.”</i> upon me that I shall not eat, or that I shall not do such-and-such a thing.’ I might think that even [if he vowed] that he would eat <i>n’veilah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>N’veilah</i> is an animal that has died a natural death, or was not properly slaughtered. <i>Treifah</i> is an animal suffering from a certain serious organic disease, even if it is properly slaughtered.

But the text of the Sifre<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifre, <i>Matoth</i> 153.</i> is not so. Instead the Rabbis taught there [the following explanation] of [the expression] <i>to bind his soul with a bond:</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 3.</i> “I might think that even if ‘he swore’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The words “he swore” show clearly that the Sifre is speaking about an oath, while Rashi applied it to a vow.</i> to eat <i>n’veiloth</i> and <i>treifoth</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>N’veilah</i> is an animal that has died a natural death, or was not properly slaughtered. <i>Treifah</i> is an animal suffering from a certain serious organic disease, even if it is properly slaughtered.

Ramban’s intent is to point out that Rashi, who made his comment on the phrase <i>if a man voweth a vow</i>, and speaks of <i>konam</i> [a term used <i>only</i> in <i>vows</i>], is diverging from the Sifre who gives this explanation on the phrase <i>or sweareth an oath</i>. Since, as will be explained further on, there are important legal differences between vows and oaths, Rashi’s application of the Sifre to the case of a vow [instead of to <i>an oath</i>] is thus incorrect.</i> And in my opinion he was not mindful [about this],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In my “Kuntros on Variant Readings in Rashi according to the first print, Reggio 1475,” p. 27 (printed in Berliner’s Rashi, Feldheim, Jerusalem, 5730) I have shown that on the basis of a minor emendation in the text of Rashi [as found in the Reggio edition], Ramban’s criticism of Rashi disappears.</i> for the Rabbis have said<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nedarim 2b.</i> that in the case of vows one makes the [actual] object [referred to in the vow] forbidden to oneself [as when one says: “May this bread be <i>konam</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word <i>konam</i> is a substitute for <i>korban</i> (offering), and is used for a vow of abstinence, meaning, “May this object be forbidden to me in the same way as it is forbidden to have any benefit from a holy offering.”</i> upon me”], and therefore [vows] do not take effect upon non-tangible matters,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 13b.</i> such as when one says, “A vow be upon me that I shall not speak to you, or that I shall not walk, or that I shall not sleep,” and similar expressions [affecting non-tangible matters]. Now this being so, it would appear that even in the case of a permitted object, if one said: “A vow be upon me that I shall eat today,” or “that I shall eat this loaf,” it is not a [valid] vow since this vow does not have any object at all on which to take effect, but [was expressed in such a way as to impose] a duty upon him [<i>personally</i>] to do it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, there is no question as to when a person “vows” to eat <i>n’veilah</i> [which is forbidden] that it is invalid, but even if he “vowed” to eat a permissible thing it is also invalid, since we do not find anywhere in the Gemara <i>vows</i> about matters which require one “to get up and do,” but only matters which require one to <i>abstain</i> from certain things. On the other hand, in the case of an “oath,” as where one says “I <i>swear</i> to eat this loaf,” the oath would indeed be valid. Since Rashi applied it to “vows,” it is therefore incorrect, as explained above. — The reason for this distinction between oaths and vows is as follows: An oath takes effect upon the person himself. Hence if he says, “<i>I swear</i> to eat the loaf,” he is obliged to do so. But a vow takes effect upon the object. Hence if he says, “<i>This bread is ‘konam</i>’ to me,” it is a valid vow and he may not eat it. But if he were to say, “A <i>vow</i> be upon me that I shall eat this loaf,” it would be invalid, since it is a contradiction in terms [the statement begins with a reference to a <i>vow</i>, but concludes with — “I shall eat …” — which is appropriate only for an <i>oath</i>].</i> And we do not find mentioned anywhere in the Gemara <i>vows</i> about [matters which require one] to “get up and do” [a particular action, but only about matters which require one to <i>abstain</i> from certain things, such as when he says, “May this loaf be <i>konam</i> upon me,” in which case he must fulfill the vow by <i>not</i> eating it]. And although we find in the case of vows [to G-d Who is] on high [that they <i>are</i> valid if uttered in the following manner]: “I undertake upon myself [to bring] a burnt-offering,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kinim 1:1.</i> or “I undertake upon myself [to bring] a peace-offering” [which would seem to indicate that vows <i>do</i> take effect when expressed as an obligation resting upon a person, and not, as explained above, that they only take effect upon a specific <i>object</i> which itself becomes forbidden], this [vow is valid] because [there is a general principle that] dedicating something [verbally] to the Sanctuary creates an obligation on one’s property exactly as if it had been handed over to an ordinary person.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Therefore when he says, “I undertake upon myself [to bring] a burnt-offering,” it is as if he had actually separated a specific animal to be an offering. Thus his vow attaches to a definite object, and therefore it is valid.</i> Or [it may be that] this is a stringency<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, even if we are not to resort to the preceding explanation that a verbal promise to the Sanctuary is tantamount to <i>actual delivery</i> of the object, we may yet explain the reason why vows to the Sanctuary are valid, because of a stringency ordained by the Rabbis based on the fact that since <i>ultimately</i> he will set aside a specific animal for his offering, therefore the effect of the vow takes place immediately upon his utterance thereof, and all his property becomes mortgaged to the fulfillment of the vow.</i> applicable [only] to vows to the Sanctuary, because they [such vows] involve an object which becomes forbidden to an ordinary person and invested [with sanctity] for the Sanctuary when [the object is actually] set aside [as an offering]; therefore right from the start [when he merely bound himself verbally to separate an animal as an offering at some future date], the obligation created by the vow takes effect upon his property. But the case of [ordinary] vows of utterance [about a secular matter] we have no such rule, because there is no [tangible] object existing at all, neither at the beginning [i.e., at the time of uttering the vow], nor at the end [i.e., at the time that the vow is to be fulfilled]. Similarly, [the expression of the Sifre mentioned by Rashi that] he can “forbid [upon himself] that which was [hitherto] permitted to him, but cannot allow himself to do that which is forbidden [by vowing to do that which is prohibited by the Torah]” is a statement which is not correct to make in connection with <i>vows</i> [as Rashi did], because they <i>do</i> take effect on matters of [religious] commandments, just as they do on secular matters [i.e., on matters which do not come within the scope of the commandments]. Thus someone who says in the form of a <i>vow</i> “I will not make a Booth [for the Festival of Tabernacles]” or “I will not put on phylacteries” is indeed forbidden [to make the Booth, or to put on the phylacteries] although he thereby violates a positive commandment.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reason for this is that since a vow takes effect upon a particular object (see Note 21), he may forbid the use of the particular Booth or of the phylacteries in the fulfillment of the commandment. But he cannot prohibit their use by means of an oath, swearing not to use them, since the oath creates a prohibition on the person, and that is invalid for him to do, since “he has already sworn on Sinai” to fulfill the commandment, and an oath does not take effect upon another oath, as will be explained.</i> Similarly a man who <i>vowed</i> not to have [sexual] intercourse with his wife is forbidden [to have such intercourse with her] although he thereby violates a negative commandment.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 21:10: <i>her food, her raiment, and ‘her conjugal rights’ he shall not diminish</i>. See Vol. II, pp. 356-357, where Ramban discusses at length the nature of this prohibition.</i> Similarly, <i>vows</i> take effect to oblige one to observe a negative commandment [although, of course, he already is bound not to transgress it], such as if he vowed not to eat <i>n’veilah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>N’veilah</i> is an animal that has died a natural death, or was not properly slaughtered. <i>Treifah</i> is an animal suffering from a certain serious organic disease, even if it is properly slaughtered. Both are forbidden to be eaten by law of the Torah. See Vol. III, p. 343, Note 96.</i> — [so that if he does it he violates two prohibitions: against eating <i>n’veilah</i>, and against breaking his vow, this principle being deduced] from the words of the Mishnah:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nedarim 17a. The Mishnah there establishes the distinction that a vow may take effect upon another vow, but one oath may not take effect upon another. From this Ramban deduces the teaching that if <i>an object</i> is prohibited to a person for some reason, such as <i>n’veilah</i> or <i>treifah</i> (see Note 14 above), or indeed any other prohibition, another vow — <i>not</i> to eat it — can still take effect upon that object doubly prohibiting the person from eating it, so that if he does eat it, he violates two prohibitions: one for having eaten <i>n’veilah</i>, and one for having violated his vow.</i> “A vow may take effect upon a vow etc.”<br>Thus a vow takes effect to forbid [not only that which was previously permitted, but also to forbid] that which was [already] forbidden [such as when he vows not to eat <i>n’veilah</i>]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>N’veilah</i> is an animal that has died a natural death, or was not properly slaughtered. <i>Treifah</i> is an animal suffering from a certain serious organic disease, even if it is properly slaughtered.

See Vol. III, p. 343, Note 96.</i> nor to neglect [the performance of] a positive commandment, such as [by saying]: “I swear that I will not make a Booth,” or “[I swear] that I will not put on phylacteries.” Even to strengthen the performance of a positive commandment [an oath] cannot take effect, so that if a person swears to fulfill a commandment and does not fulfill it, he is not liable for [breaking his] oath either to [the punishment of] stripes [if he deliberately neglects it] or to [bring] an offering [if he neglects it accidentally].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The punishment for breaking an oath in optional matters deliberately is the same as for transgressing any negative commandment; i.e., stripes (Deuteronomy 25:1-3), and for accidentally breaking it, there is a duty to bring an offering (Leviticus 5:4-13). But if one swears to fulfill a positive commandment [e.g. “I swear to wear phylacteries”] the oath is invalid, because “he has already sworn at Mount Sinai” [to perform all the commandments of the Torah], and an oath does not take effect upon another oath (see Note 27). Therefore if he does <i>not</i> fulfill the commandment, he is responsible for neglect of a positive commandment, but is not subject to stripes or an offering for failure of fulfilling the additional oath, since his oath never took effect.</i> But it is permitted for a person to encourage himself [to fulfill a commandment by swearing to do so], for it is written, <i>I have sworn, and have confirmed it, to observe Thy righteous ordinances</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 119:106.

In both cases the meaning of the prepositional <i>lamed</i> [‘<i>lo</i>’] is its literal meaning — “unto him,” and the intention is to say that the oath was “for his benefit.” Likewise the prepositional <i>lamed</i> [in the word <i>la’shem</i>] used by David has its literal meaning — “for ‘the benefit’ [so to say] and glory of G-d,” since the oath concerned his determination to build the House of G-d.</i> which means that he swore to him for his [the recipient’s] benefit. But [the use of the prepositional <i>lamed</i> in the case of vows is equivalent to the use of the preposition <i>beth</i> (“by”)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The gist of Ramban’s reasoning is as follows: The prepositional <i>lamed</i> in the case of <i>oaths</i> [in the examples cited above] has the meaning of “to” — to the benefit of the recipient, as is the case of Eliezer where the oath was for the benefit of Abraham. This principle, however, cannot be made to apply to vows, since in our verse it says <i>if a man vows a vow ‘la’shem</i>,’ and the verse is <i>not</i> speaking exclusively about vows to the benefit of the Sanctuary but refers to vows of all sorts, even of secular matters. Hence we must say that the prepositional <i>lamed</i> in <i>vows</i> has the same meaning as the <i>beth</i> [not the <i>lamed</i>] in <i>oaths</i>, which in both cases means “by” — by G-d. In other words, the prepositional <i>lamed</i> in <i>vows</i> and the <i>beth</i> in <i>oaths</i> are identical in meaning. Finally, Ramban will conclude that the Cabala does offer an explanation why a different preposition is used in each case. Thus it is shown that the mystic character of the Sacred Language is deeply embedded in the text of the Torah.</i> in the case of oaths, for] in the case of oaths Scripture says: <i>‘u’vishmo’</i> (<i>and ‘by’ His Name</i>) <i>shalt thou swear;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 6:13.</i> <i>v’ashbiacha ‘ba’shem’</i> (<i>and I will make thee swear ‘by’ the Eternal</i>);<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 24:3.</i> <i>as I swore ‘lecha’</i> (<i>unto thee</i>) <i>‘ba’shem’</i> (<i>‘by’ the Eternal</i>), <i>the G-d of Israel, saying: Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Kings 1:30.</i> <i>swear ‘li’</i> (<i>unto me</i>) <i>here ‘bei’Elokim’</i> (<i>‘by’ G-d</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 21:23.</i> But in the case of a vow Scripture does not say: “he vows <i>‘ba’shem’</i> (‘by’ G-d)” but <i>la’shem</i> (‘to’ G-d). The Sages in the Sifre have already alluded to the reason for this matter [the different terminology], saying:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifre, <i>Matoth</i> 153. See Vol. I, p. 66, where Ramban quotes this Sifre.</i> “What is the difference between vows and oaths? Vows are like vowing<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the text in the Sifre and in Ramban here. In Genesis, however, Ramban has “swearing” (Vol. I, p. 66). The intent of the texts in both places is equivalent.</i> ‘by the life of the King;’ oaths are like swearing ‘by the King Himself.’ Although there is no [clear] proof for this explanation [in Scripture], there is an allusion to it: <i>By the living G-d, and by the life of your soul.

Scripture wanted to mention the [case of] prohibition first [in Verses 4-5, namely that if she makes a vow and her father is quiet about it or confirms it, <i>then all her vows shall stand ..</i>] in order to tell us that a young girl [in her father’s house] is also subject to the negative commandment mentioned [previously], that <i>he shall not break his word</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 3.</i> and therefore if her father confirms her vow [expressly or tacitly] the vow shall <i>stand</i>, but if he disallowed her, it <i>shall not stand</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 6.</i> And Scripture states [in conclusion], <i>and the Eternal will forgive her, because her father disallowed her</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 6.</i> in order to tell us that G-d <i>will</i> only <i>forgive her</i> if she acted [in disregard of her vow] <i>after</i> her father had disallowed it, but not [if she broke it] at the beginning, that is, if she [first] transgressed her vow and later on her father disallowed it, just as the Rabbis have said: “[The father or husband] ‘cuts off’ [the vow from the moment that he disallows it], but [unlike a Sage] he does not uproot it retrospectively.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nedarim 68a. The intention of this statement is to contrast the law, of a Sage who “releases” a vow, with that of a father or husband who “annuls” it. In order that a vow or oath should be valid, the person who makes it must at the time of the utterance thereof have been fully aware of its consequences. If at that time he did not fully understand all that his vow or oath entailed, the Sage points this out to him and affords him an opportunity to regret having made it. If he so declares that he regrets it, the Sage “releases” him from the vow or oath. This release “uproots it” from the very start, since it has now been shown that he made it under a misapprehension. The father or husband, on the other hand, is empowered by the Torah to “annul” the vow or oath, even if made under no misapprehension and the daughter or wife does not regret it. Therefore there is no power of retroactive effect; instead, the “annulment” only “cuts off” in the future. One of the differences between these two procedures is here referred to by Ramban, and that is namely, if the person who made the vow or oath violates it <i>before</i> the time of “release” or “annulment.” In the case of the release by the Sage, since it takes effect retrospectively, there is no sin. In the case of the father or the husband, however, there is a sin entailed.</i>"

Still less need it be said if one of them explicitly confirmed the vow” (Nedarim 67a). — It should be noted that the term “betrothed” in this connection has reference to the actual “betrothal” of a man to a woman to be his wife [not a mere “engagement”]. In the eyes of the Jewish law she is then considered his wife, except that the consummation of the marriage takes place some time after the betrothal.</i> And [even without resorting to this reasoning], it is the tradition [of the Rabbis] which decides [the true meaning of the verses]."

                    "WHOSOEVER HATH KILLED ANY PERSON, AND WHOSOEVER HATH TOUCHED ANY SLAIN, [PURIFY YOURSELVES ON THE THIRD DAY AND ON THE SEVENTH DAY]. “Rabbi Meir says: Scripture is speaking about someone who killed with an object which is susceptible of impurity, and the verse [here] teaches you that the object [i.e., the weapon] renders the person impure through [indirect] contact with the corpse as if he had touched the corpse itself.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">82</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The implication is that the sword is itself “a progenitor of fathers of impurity” like the corpse, and the person who touches the sword becomes a “father of impurity,” who is rendered impure and may not enter the Divine camp for seven days. See above, <i>Seder Chukath</i>, Note 40.</i> I might think that even if he shot an arrow at him and killed him [the same law applies]; Scripture therefore says, <i>and whosoever hath killed any person</i> [<i>and whosoever hath touched any slain</i>].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">83</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 19.</i> Thus it compares a person who kills to a person who touches. Just as he who touches [is rendered impure] by virtue of that contact [with the corpse], so is the person who kills [rendered impure] by virtue of his contact [with the corpse, effected through the weapon he holds in his hand, which contact is non-existent when he shoots an arrow and kills him].” Thus far is the language of Rashi.<br>But his words are not clear to me. For if he killed with an object which is susceptible to impurity but can be [made pure] by immersion,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">84</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This term includes all vessels except those made of earthenware, which, once rendered impure, cannot be purified by immersion in a ritual pool or by any other means. All other vessels can be so purified.</i> then the person touching it does <i>not</i> contract the seven-day period of impurity, nor does he require the sprinkling [of the waters of purification], since the object [with which he killed] becomes “a father of impurity,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">85</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See above, <i>Seder Chukath</i>, Note 40, for an explanation of this subject.</i> and the person who becomes impure through it, becomes a “first degree of impurity” [who is only required to immerse himself in a ritual pool and he becomes pure the evening of that same day; and since the verse here requires a seven-day period of impurity, it cannot be referring to such a case]. And if [he killed him] with a <i>metal</i> instrument, we have already been taught<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">86</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above 19:16. See Ramban there.</i> that a sword [or any metal object with which a person is killed] is exactly the same degree of impurity as the dead person himself,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">82</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The implication is that the sword is itself “a progenitor of fathers of impurity” like the corpse, and the person who touches the sword becomes a “father of impurity,” who is rendered impure and may not enter the Divine camp for seven days. See above, <i>Seder Chukath</i>, Note 40.</i> and therefore conveys a seven-days’ impurity [to anyone who touches it, so there is no need for our verse to repeat this principle]. And if the Rabbi [Rashi] is of the opinion that since he [the killer] touched the instrument <i>whilst</i> it was itself still in contact with the corpse [then even if it was <i>not</i> a metal object] it renders him impure for a seven-day period just as [if he had touched] the corpse itself — such [conveyance of a stricter degree of] impurity through [indirect] contact is only a law of the Rabbis when the contact is that of objects with a corpse, as is explained in Tractate Neziruth, Chapter <i>Shloshah Minim</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">87</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “Three things” [the opening words of that particular chapter of the Tractate]. The text referred to here is found in Nazir 42b: “But is [the law that the corpse conveys] impurity [to a human being] by contact [with an object which touches the corpse at the same time as touching the human being] a Scriptural law? [It is only a law of the Rabbis!] “It is obvious, therefore, that the <i>Scriptural</i> verses here cannot be speaking of such a case. Hence Rashi’s comment “that the verse [here] teaches you that the object renders the person impure through contact etc.” cannot be the correct explanation of this verse.</i><br>But the language of the Rabbis in the Sifre is as follows:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">88</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifre, <i>Chukath</i> 127.</i> “Rabbi Meir says: Scripture is speaking about someone who killed with an object which is susceptible to impurity, and [teaches us that] it conveys impurity by moving [the corpse, as will be explained further on]. Or I might think that even if he shot an arrow at him and killed him [the same law applies]; Scripture therefore says etc.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">89</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“<i>And whosoever hath killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain</i>. Thus it compares etc. “[as quoted by Ramban from Rashi’s commentary].</i> And the meaning of [this Sifre] is that Rabbi Meir came to deduce from here [the principle] that a human corpse conveys impurity when carried. Thus if he killed him with a walking-stick or a spear, even if it did not consist of metal, and he was “carried,” [i.e., the slain person was moved] through them,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">90</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is known as <i>tumath heset</i> — “the impurity caused by shaking” an impure object [such as <i>n’veilah</i>, or a human corpse] so as to move it from its place. Such movement, even if done in an indirect manner, is sufficient to convey impurity, just as if it had been carried directly.</i> at the time of death, the corpse conveys impurity of seven-days’ duration to the person who “carried” [i.e., moved] it. And when [using the phrase] “an object which is susceptible to impurity,” Rabbi Meir was not referring to a vessel which forms a receptacle [and is therefore susceptible to impurity] but to an object through which the person receives impurity [directly] from the corpse itself,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">91</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, Rabbi Meir’s statement [quoted by Rashi] does not refer to <i>a vessel</i> forming a receptacle but to an object through which <i>the person</i> becomes impure from the corpse itself by shifting or shaking it, even if the person did not touch or carry the corpse at all, since causing an impure object to move or to shake is subject to the same law as carrying it. This interpretation of Rabbi Meir’s meaning is made clear by the first part of the Beraitha, which Ramban now brings, and which Rashi did not quote. Ramban in conclusion proceeds to explain that although the anonymous opinion in the first part of the Beraitha agrees with Rabbi Meir on the main principle referred to here, that causing a corpse to move also conveys impurity of seven-days’ duration — they disagree on the process of reasoning which establishes this principle, as Ramban explains.</i> such as by “carrying” [i.e., moving it]. And the beginning of this Beraitha there [in the Sifre] states as follows:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">88</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifre, <i>Chukath</i> 127.</i> “Whence do we know that it [a corpse] conveys impurity by shaking it? You make use of a <i>kal vachomer:</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">92</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The syllogism of “a minor and major” [<i>a fortiori</i> argument]. See Ramban, Vol. II, p. 133, Note 208.</i> If a dead animal that conveys a non-stringent form of impurity [since it conveys impurity only until the evening of the same day] nonetheless conveys impurity by being moved, is it not logical that a human corpse that conveys a stringent form of impurity [i.e., an impurity of seven-days’ duration] should convey impurity by being moved! But if so [you might argue] that just as there, the impurity conveyed [by moving the dead animal] is only until the evening, so here also [in the case of the human corpse], the impurity conveyed [by moving or shaking it] is only until the evening [of that day ! You must say that this cannot be so. Rather,] you must say that the law of moving it is the same as touching it. Where touching [the source of impurity] renders one impure for a seven-days’ duration [as does touching a corpse], so also does moving it render one impure for a seven-days’ duration, and where touching renders one only impure until the evening [as does touching a dead animal], moving it also renders one impure only until the evening. Rabbi Meir says etc.” From here then, the meaning of the Beraitha becomes apparent, as we have explained it above:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">91</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, Rabbi Meir’s statement [quoted by Rashi] does not refer to <i>a vessel</i> forming a receptacle but to an object through which <i>the person</i> becomes impure from the corpse itself by shifting or shaking it, even if the person did not touch or carry the corpse at all, since causing an impure object to move or to shake is subject to the same law as carrying it.

See Ramban, Vol. II, p. 133, Note 208.</i> the principle that carrying [or moving] a corpse [without touching it] conveys impurity even for a seven-days’ duration, because he does not adopt [the principle of] <i>dayo</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">93</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “It is sufficient.” This means that it is “sufficient” for a law to be derived by logical conclusion from another law to be only <i>as strict</i> as that law, but it cannot be <i>stricter</i> than the law from which it is derived. Thus, in the case before us, the law that causing <i>a corpse</i> to move conveys impurity, is derived — according to the First Sage of the Beraitha — from the law causing <i>a dead animal</i> to move. Hence if we apply the principle of <i>dayo</i> we must conclude that the impurity conveyed to one by causing a corpse to move is <i>only as strict</i> as causing a dead animal to move, namely, until the same evening. But since the anonymous First Sage recorded in the first half of the Beraitha clearly states that causing a corpse to move conveys a seven-days’ duration of impurity, it is clear that he does <i>not</i> accept the principle of <i>dayo</i>. On the other hand, Rabbi Meir who accepts this principle of <i>dayo</i>, cannot therefore derive the law that causing a corpse to move conveys a seven-days’ duration of impurity from the <i>kal vachomer</i> of the law of causing a dead animal to move. Hence he derives it from our verse which expressly likens the law of causing a corpse to move with that of touching it, in which latter case the impurity conveyed is that of a seven-days’ duration. This is the gist of Ramban’s explanation.</i> whereas Rabbi Meir derived it from this verse [before us], because since he follows the principle of <i>dayo</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">93</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “It is sufficient.” This means that it is “sufficient” for a law to be derived by logical conclusion from another law to be only <i>as strict</i> as that law, but it cannot be <i>stricter</i> than the law from which it is derived.

Therefore our Rabbis had to explain<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">97</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Abodah Zarah 75b.</i> that this purification [mentioned here by Scripture] refers to remove from them [the traces of] the forbidden foods which they had absorbed whilst they were in the possession of the non-Jews. This is the true [explanation] without any doubt.",
                    "AND ALL THAT COMETH NOT INTO THE FIRE — “anything which is not [normally] used on fire, such as cups, flasks, and pitchers which are used [to contain] cold substances, and [therefore] have not absorbed [any of the traces of forbidden foods] <i>ye shall pass through the water</i>, meaning that it is sufficient to immerse them.” This is Rashi’s language. But it does not appear to me to be correct, for the term <i>ta’aviru</i> (<i>ye shall pass through</i>) does not refer to immersion; for [had this been the case], it would have said “<i>tavi’u</i> (ye shall put it) into water,” which is the expression used in connection with immersion, just as it says, <i>it ‘yuva’</i> (<i>must be put into</i>) <i>water, and it shall be unclean until the even, and then it shall be clean</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">98</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 11:32.</i> Furthermore, even those vessels, which are only used for <i>cold</i> things [of forbidden foods] need purification from [the traces of] their forbidden foods in addition to this immersion [which Rashi mentioned], and how can it be that Scripture [here] does not mention the [method] of purification [for such vessels] as it did with reference to those vessels <i>that come into the fire</i>? And when the Sages deduced [the necessity for] this immersion they did not mention that the source for it was this [part of the] verse [quoted here by Rashi], but interpreted it<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">97</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Abodah Zarah 75b.</i> [on the basis of that part of the verse which says]: “<i>Nevertheless it shall be purified with the waters of ‘niddah’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">99</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here in Verse 23.</i> — waters which are fit for a <i>niddah</i> (a menstruant woman) to immerse herself in.”<br>But the meaning of <i>ye shall pass through the water</i> is that you should wash them and rub them thoroughly in water until you remove the deposit of forbidden foods which has formed on the vessels by being used for such foods, and this [process] constitutes their purification from the forbidden foods. Scripture is thus saying that [in order to purify a vessel from the forbidden food which it has absorbed] you must put into fire those [vessels] which are used on the fire, in exactly the same way that they were used for [cooking] the forbidden foods. Hence if it was used on the flame itself — such as [a vessel of] iron or copper, and also silver or gold — he must make it white-hot in a flame, and if it was used to contain hot substances, such as [a vessel made of] tin or lead, he cleanses it with boiling-hot water; and if it was not used on fire [or for hot substances] but only for cold foodstuffs, he scours it with water until it is properly cleansed, and then it becomes pure. And similarly the Sages said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">97</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Abodah Zarah 75b.</i> “He scours them, and immerses them, and they are then pure.” In the language of the Sifre:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">100</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifre, <i>Matoth</i> 158. This language shows that the “passing through water” referred to here, means cleansing of the food deposits, and not, as Rashi explained, merely immersion.</i> “<i>Ye shall pass through the fire</i> — such as knives, because they are [used as spits and] burned by the non-Jews. <i>And all that cometh not into the fire</i>, such as cups, <i>ye shall pass through the water</i> in order to remove the deposits of [the food of] the non-Jews.” And Scripture did not need to mention again [at this second part of the verse, i.e., <i>and all that cometh ‘not’ into the fire</i>], the necessity of immersion [in a ritual pool, which is required after cleansing the vessel before it can be used], because He had already mentioned [in the first part of the verse, concerning vessels that are used in the fire, stating]: <i>nevertheless it shall be purified with the waters of ‘niddah’</i> [meaning, as explained above, “waters which are fit for ‘a menstruant’ woman to immerse herself in”], and [it is self-understood that] after the traces of forbidden foods have been removed from the vessels they are all alike with respect to the law [requiring] immersion [whether they were used in the fire or not].<br>And I further take into consideration<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">101</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “And my heart further thinks” on this matter to say etc. — See Rambam in Mishneh Torah, <i>Hilchoth Ma’achaloth Assuroth</i> 17:5, who is also of the opinion that the requirement of immersion of vessels is an ordinance of the Rabbis. See also Shulchan Aruch, <i>Yoreh Deiah</i> Chapter 120, for the application of this law nowadays.</i> that this immersion [of all vessels obtained from non-Jews, after they have been cleansed from the traces and absorption of forbidden foods prepared in them], is a law of the Rabbis, and they quoted the verse merely as a Scriptural support [for the Rabbinic ordinance]. And similarly Onkelos translated [the phrase, <i>the waters of ‘niddah’</i>] as meaning “the purification of ‘sprinkling’ of [the water containing] the ashes of the [Red] Heifer” [which was required in order to purify those who had come into contact with a dead body, and thus it does not refer at all to the requirement of immersion. The Rabbis [according to this explanation] only required immersion of <i>metal</i> vessels, because some of them are used on fire, either as a “first vessel” [used directly on the flame], or as a “second vessel” [i.e., those which are not actually used for cooking but into which a boiling substance has been put or poured], and [some metal vessels are used] for cold foodstuffs. But this matter needs further investigation.<br>Now He warned them here to remove from the vessels of the Midianites the [traces and absorptions of the] forbidden foods [which they had absorbed when they were in the possession] of the non-Jews, but He did not tell them this [law] at the beginning — in connection with the vessels of [the Amorite peoples ruled by] Sihon and Og which they also took as spoil, as it is said, <i>Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, with the spoil of the cities which we had taken</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">102</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 2:35.</i> The reason for this is that Sihon and Og were Amorite kings, and their land was part of Israel’s inheritance, and therefore all spoil taken from them was allowed for the Israelites, including foods [usually] forbidden; for it is written, <i>and houses full of all good things, which thou didst not fill</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">103</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 6:11.</i> and our Rabbis have said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">104</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chullin 17a.</i> “<i>kadlei</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">105</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The hind part of the head, together with the neck. In our Gemara <i>ibid.</i>, the reading is “<i>katlei</i> of swine,” which Rashi interprets as “dried swine.” See also Ramban on Deuteronomy 6:10.</i> of swine was [hereby especially] permitted for them.” But Midian was not part of their [inheritance], and they [the Israelites] did not capture their land from them; it was only to execute vengeance on them [as they were commanded to do as a punishment for causing the Israelites to sin] that they killed them and took their spoil, and therefore the [usual] prohibition of using their vessels [without removing from them the traces and absorptions of the forbidden foods] applied. Similarly, He [only] commanded them [now] about the law of impurity [conveyed by the dead, saying], <i>And abide ye without the camp seven days</i> etc.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">106</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 19.</i> [and did not command them about it in the earlier war against Sihon and Og], because in the war against Sihon and Og <i>all</i> Israel participated, and when the [entire] public is involved, impurity is permitted,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">107</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This principle refers primarily to the Divine Service in the Sanctuary, and the gist of it is that if all the priests and people became defiled, the public offerings may nonetheless be brought in this state of impurity, because “impurity is permitted when the [entire] public is involved.” Ramban’s application of this principle to the problem before us [namely why the people were not commanded in the wars against Sihon and Og that all who had come into contact with the dead must <i>abide without the camp for seven days</i>], has engendered much discussion among later scholars. See my Hebrew commentary, p. 328.</i> [whereas, as explained above in Verse 6, only a select few, and not the whole people, were sent to execute vengeance on Midian.] But according to the plain meaning of Scripture, He warned them [the twelve thousand men who fought against Midian], “<i>And abide ye without the camp seven days</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">106</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 19.</i> and purify yourselves,” in order that they should not defile [the rest of] the people, but there [in the case of the wars against Sihon and Og] they were all equally impure [since they all went to fight; hence there was no point commanding them to <i>abide without the camp</i>, since they all required purification anyhow]."

Thus out of the total inheritance given to the whole tribe of Menasheh, ten-elevenths were allotted to the families that settled in the Land of Israel proper — they are the <i>ten parts</i> referred to in Joshua 17:5 — while the remaining eleventh part was assigned to the families of Menasheh on the east side of the Jordan.</i> of [the total population of] the tribe took their inheritance in the land of Bashan [on the east side of the Jordan] and ten parts remained [and settled in the Land of Israel].

Perhaps it was because these two families — the Machirites and the Gileadites — were the smallest of their tribe [and would therefore have received only a small portion of the land allotted to their tribe] that they wanted to separate themselves from their tribe, in order that they should have a greater inheritance [proportionally] than the rest of them, for they could conquer it by their sword, as it is said, <i>because he</i> [Machir] <i>was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">134</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 17:1.</i> This is why Scripture mentioned ‘<i>parts</i>’ with reference to this tribe [of Menasheh, saying, <i>And there fell ten ‘parts’ to Menasheh</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">131</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 5.</i> a term] which it does not use in connection with any of the other tribes.

But the children of Reuben and of Gad still called them by [these Moabite] names when they rebuilt them. [This explanation is borne out by the fact that] the verse does not say, “and they gave names to the cities which they built,” but it says, <i>and they called by names the names of the cities</i> [<i>which they builded</i>], meaning that they called them by name with the same names which they originally had [when they were still under the rule of Moab.

According to Ramban, the phrase refers to <i>the Amorites</i>, who changed the original Moabite names in an attempt to erase the Moabite origin of these cities. Since the Amorites gave them the names of their idols, therefore the children of Reuben and Gad reverted to the original Moabite names in order not to have to mention the names of idols, or, as Ramban suggests, in order to shame the Moabites.</i> because [they did not want to use the Amorite names since] the Amorites used to call their cities by the names of their idols.

This man [who was in fact from the tribe of Judah, as will be explained] is [here] traced back by genealogy to his mother’s family [Menasheh], because he took his inheritance together with them [i.e., the children of Menasheh]. And in the Book of Chronicles<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">158</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Chronicles 2:21-22.</i> it says explicitly that he was a son<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">159</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Actually “a grandson,” for his father was Segub, the son of Hezron (<i>ibid.</i>, Verse 22).</i> of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah, and his mother was the daughter of Machir the son of Menasheh, as it says, <i>And afterward Hezron went in to the daughter of Machir the father of Gilead; whom he took to wife when he was threeescore years old, and she bore him Segub. And Segub begot Jair, who had three and twenty cities in the land of Gilead;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">158</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Chronicles 2:21-22.</i> and it is [further] written, <i>And Geshur and Aram took the hamlets of Jair from them, Kenath, and the villages thereof, even threescore cities. All these were the sons of Machir the father of Gilead</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">160</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 23.</i> From this [fact that Kenath is here described as being amongst <i>‘the hamlets of Jair’</i>] it would appear that Nobach [mentioned here in Verse 42] who <i>conquered Kenath and the villages thereof</i> was a son of Jair, [although it is not mentioned here], and therefore these cities were also called ‘<i>the hamlets of Jair</i>.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">161</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban here means that the explanation of the phrase at the end of Verse 42, <i>vayikra lah Nobach bi’shmo</i> is: “Nobach called it [i.e., <i>Kenath and the villages thereof</i>] by <i>his</i> name” [i.e., by the name of Jair — his father — mentioned in the previous verse]; hence these towns also came to be called ‘<i>the hamlets of Jair</i>,’ as they are described in I Chronicles <i>ibid.</i></i><br>And the meaning of the verse, <i>And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Menasheh</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">162</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 40 here.</i> is [not “unto Machir” himself, but unto] his family, for it was his sons who conquered it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">163</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 39: <i>And the children of Machir the son of Menasheh went to Gilead and conquered it</i>.</i> Similarly, <i>And unto Machir I gave Gilead</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">164</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 3:15.</i> means “unto the Machirites,” for since Machir was an honored man and the chief of all his descendants, therefore his children were called by his name, and in the same way the verses refer to the heads of the tribes in connection with the inheritance [given to their children]: <i>southward it was Ephraim’s, and northward it was Menasheh’s</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">165</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 17:10.</i> So also: <i>The land of Tappuah belonged to Menasheh</i> etc.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">166</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 8.</i> And when Scripture says in the Book of Joshua, <i>And this was the lot for the tribe of Menasheh; for he was the firstborn of Joseph.

Perhaps Machir was still alive [at the time of the division of the Land in the days of Joshua], for the decree [against the generation] of the wilderness [resulting from the incident of the spies, that they were to die in the desert] had not been decreed upon him, as he was not amongst those counted by Moses and Aaron, being he was more than sixty years old [at the time of the first census after the exodus],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">168</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Baba Bathra 121b.</i> and he enjoyed longevity as did the earlier generations.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">169</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Vol. I, pp. 98-99.</i>"

                    "VAYIKRA LAH NOBACH’ (AND HE CALLED IT NOBACH). “[The word <i>lah</i>] has no dot in the [letter] <i>hei</i> [as it usually has when it means “to it”]. And I have seen in the work of Rabbi Moshe the Preacher<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">170</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See above in <i>Seder Naso</i>, Note 146.</i> that because it did not keep this name permanently, therefore [the letter <i>hei</i> in the word <i>lah</i>] is pronounced softly [without the dot], and the interpretation implied is [as if it said] <i>lo</i> [meaning “not”]. But I am astonished at this, for what interpretation will he [Rabbi Moshe the Preacher] give in the case of two other similar words: <i>‘Vayomer lah Boaz’</i> (<i>And Boaz said to her</i>);<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">171</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ruth 2:14.</i> <i>‘livnoth lah bayith’</i> (<i>to build her a house</i>)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">172</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zecharia 5:11.</i> [in both of which places the word <i>lah</i> is also written without a dot in the letter <i>hei</i>]!” This is the language of Rashi.<br>Now although the Rabbi [Rashi] is “like a filled treasury of knowledge”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">173</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gittin 67a.</i> of Torah, Halachoth and Agadoth, yet the explanation of the Rabbis in Midrash Ruth escaped his attention, [for they remarked<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">174</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ruth Rabbah 5:5.</i> on the verse: “<i>Though I</i> [Ruth] <i>be not as one of thy handmaids</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">175</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ruth 2:13.</i> Said Boaz to Ruth: Far be it from me [to consider you like one of the handmaids!] You are not like one of the handmaids, but like one of the matriarchs!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">176</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus the phrase <i>‘Vayomer lah Boaz’</i> (<i>and Boaz said to her</i>), which follows Ruth’s remark [<i>though I be not as one of thy handmaids</i>] is written without the dot in the letter <i>hei</i>, the idea being, as Rabbi Moshe the Preacher explained, to convey the thought of <i>lo</i>, meaning a negation. Boaz is therefore saying to Ruth: “‘<i>Lo</i>’ — it is <i>not</i> as you say that you are like one of the handmaids in my eyes; on the contrary, you are like one of the matriarchs, and you are destined to be the ancestress of kings.”</i> Similarly, <i>And Nobach went and conquered Kenath, and the villages thereof, ‘vayikra lah Nobach bi’shmo’</i> (<i>and he called it Nobach, after his own name</i>) — this [lack of the dot in the letter <i>hei</i>] indicates that this name did not remain. So also, <i>And he said unto me: To build ‘lah’</i>(<i>for her</i>) <i>a house in the land of Shinar</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">172</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zecharia 5:11.</i> — this teaches us that falsehood does not lead to any salvation.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">177</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The point here is that the prophet Zechariah saw a measure of falsehood being flown to a certain country. When he asked the angel, <i>Whither do these</i> [messengers] <i>bear the measure?</i> (Zechariah 5:10) he received the answer: <i>‘livnoth lah bayith’</i> (<i>to build her a house</i>) <i>in Shinar</i> [which is another name for Babylon]. Now since the word <i>lah</i> is written without the dot in the letter <i>hei</i>, the Rabbis interpreted that this is a negation, as if it said <i>lo</i>, conveying the idea that one may build a house of falsehood, but it will not last. — Thus the Midrash explains both the verses which Rashi found difficult.</i> Thus far is the Agadah. And similarly in the Gemara of Tractate Sanhedrin<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">178</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 24a.</i> the Rabbis said [with reference to the measure seen by the prophet Zechariah]:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">177</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The point here is that the prophet Zechariah saw a measure of falsehood being flown to a certain country.

After the vengeance [executed] upon Midian, concerning which the Holy One, blessed be He, told Moses, <i>afterwards shalt thou be gathered unto thy people</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 31:2.</i> and after Moses had apportioned the land of Sihon and Og [to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half of the tribe of Menasheh] and they had built the [previously] mentioned cities,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 32:34-38.</i> he set his mind to write down [the various stages of] the journeyings [in the desert]. His intention in so doing was to inform [future generations] of the loving kindnesses of the Holy One, blessed be He, towards them, for even though He had decreed upon them that they had to move about and wander around in the wilderness, you should not think that they were continually wandering and moving around from place to place without any rest; for throughout all this long [period of] time they only went on forty-two journeys as the Rabbi — Rashi — wrote, [citing] the words of Rabbi Moshe the Preacher.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See above in <i>Seder Naso</i>, Note 146.</i><br>And the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] added in the Moreh Nebuchim<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Guide of the Perplexed III, 50. Ramban is using Al Charizi’s Hebrew translation from the Arabic [rather than Ibn Tibbon’s].</i> another [explanation as to the] benefit [that we derive] from knowledge [of these stages], saying: “There was a very great necessity in mentioning the [stages of the] journeyings. For [although] the miracles and wonders that were done were [recognized as] true ones by all who saw them, in later times these events would be matters of hearsay, and those who hear about them [then] might deny them altogether. Now among the greatest miracles and wonders [related] in the Torah is Israel’s survival in the wilderness for forty years, and finding the manna every day, although these places [where they stayed] are very far from cultivated settlements, and are not natural habitat for human beings, not being a <i>place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 20:5.</i> and the Torah states, <i>Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 29:5.</i> All these [matters] are signs of events of a miraculous nature which were seen by [the human] eye. But the Creator blessed be He, knew that these wonders will be subject to the process which occurs to [all] historical events — that those who hear them will not believe them; and they will think [about these events] that the sojourn of the Israelites in the wilderness was [in a place] near the cultivated settlement, where people can live there, such as the deserts in which the Arabs live today, or [that they stayed in] places where there was plowing and harvesting, or where there were grasses and plants suitable for human consumption, and that there were wells of water in those places. Therefore in order to remove from people’s hearts all such thoughts, and to firmly establish [the truth of] all these miracles, [He recorded] as a [permanent] memorial the [stages of their] journeyings [in the wilderness], so that the future generations would see them and acknowledge the great wonders [entailed] in keeping people alive in such places for forty years.” All these are his words [i.e., the words of Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon].<br>Thus the writing down [the stages of] the journeyings was a commandment of G-d, either for the reasons mentioned above or for some other reasons, [for] a purpose the secret of which has not been revealed to us. For [the expression] <i>by the commandment of the Eternal</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 2.</i> is connected with [the beginning of that verse], <i>And Moses wrote</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 2.</i> unlike the opinion of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra who wrote that it is connected with <i>according to their journeys</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 2 reads: <i>And Moses wrote their goings forth according to their journeys by the commandment of the Eternal</i>. Ibn Ezra explains that the phrase <i>by the commandment of the Eternal</i> is connected with <i>according to their journeys</i>, meaning that all <i>their journeys were by the commandment of G-d</i>. Ramban objects to this explanation because this fact has already been expressed elsewhere in Scripture, and therefore he explains that the phrase refers to the beginning of the verse, <i>And Moses wrote</i>, and the intention is to say that Moses wrote down the various stages of the journeys by G-d’s command, and not of his own accord.</i> for Scripture has already informed us of this [fact, saying]: <i>according to the commandment of the Eternal they remained encamped, and according to the commandment of the Eternal they journeyed</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 9:20.</i>"

Similarly, <i>the inhabitants of Canaan</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 15:15.</i> and <i>O Canaan, the land of the Philistines; I will even destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zephaniah 2:5.

A THOUSAND CUBITS ROUND ABOUT. But afterwards [in Verse 5] it says [that it should be] <i>two thousand cubits!</i> How can we explain this? He assigned two thousand cubits for them around [the cities], of which the inner [area with a radius of a] thousand [cubits, as mentioned in Verse 4] was to be free [open] space, and the outer [area of a thousand cubits] was to be for fields and vineyards round about.” This is Rashi’s language taken from the words of our Rabbis.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sotah 27b. Thus, according to Rashi, two thousand cubits were assigned for each of the four sides round about the Levite city. Of these, the <i>innermost</i> thousand served as the open space, and the <i>outermost</i> was for fields and vineyards. Thus the two verses are harmonized. It will be noted though that Rashi did not assign any dimensions for the city proper. This will be one of the major contentions of Ramban, from which will follow important conclusions (see Note 59).</i><br>The correct interpretation according to the plain meaning of Scripture seems to be that Scripture [in Verse 4] is stating that they should assign as open space a <i>thousand</i> cubits directly round about the city, meaning that [the combined open space of <i>both sides</i> of the city] should be a thousand cubits long, five hundred on each side, and similarly [the open space of <i>both sides</i> together] of the width, should be a thousand cubits, five hundred cubits on each side.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus, where Rashi assigned two thousand cubits for each of the four sides outside the city (as explained in the preceding note), Ramban allocates only five hundred for each side, totalling one thousand on the two opposite sides.</i> After this He stated [in Verse 5] that they should make a square [the dimension of which to be] two thousand cubits by two thousand cubits, and the city should be situated in the center of the square. He thus added to them [the dimensions — in Verse 5] an open space not directly facing the city, equal to the measurement directly in front of the city, so that you find when leaving a thousand cubits as open space round about the city as He assigned at first [in Verse 4], the city, a thousand by a thousand cubits, will be in [the center of] the square.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus, while Rashi did not designate any dimensions for the Levite city proper, Ramban assigned it a thousand by a thousand cubits. [See in Erubin 56b where one of the Amoraim, Abaye, indeed proposes these measurements for the Levite city, and this may well be the source of Ramban’s interpretation at which many scholars have wondered.] By placing now this square-shaped city of a thousand by a thousand in the center of the larger outer-square of two thousand by two thousand, some important conclusions follow. Since, as has been clarified before, a <i>migrash</i> (open space) of five hundred by a thousand extends in each direction <i>directly facing</i> the city, there still remains a space of five hundred by five hundred above and below these <i>migrashim</i>, near the corners of the <i>outer</i> square. These remaining spaces, Ramban will suggest, were to be designated for fields and vineyards. [In a drawing of Ramban’s design of the Levite city, found in my Hebrew commentary, p. 336, there will be noticed a circle encompassing all these four <i>migrashim</i> directly facing the city up to the walls of the outer-square. The circle naturally cuts down somewhat on the space allotted for the fields and vineyards. I based this upon the Gemara in Erubin <i>ibid.</i>, as interpreted by the commentators, especially the Ritba, in order to bring Ramban’s words into consonance with the text there. Ramban’s general concept though of the Levite city and its environs as presented here, according to the plain meaning of Scripture, is clear.]</i> Thus the city given to the Levites was in the form of a square.<br>Know that the term <i>pei’ah</i> [in Verse 5] signifies “a whole side” [i.e., the <i>whole</i> length of the distance of any of the four sides of the outer square, and not merely any point along that side].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus, unlike Rashi who explained, for example, <i>eth ‘pe’ath keidmah alpayim ba’amah</i> (<i>for the east ‘side’ two thousand cubits</i>) as <i>any point</i> on that eastern side of the circle, located two thousand cubits away from the city (see Note 57), Ramban applies it to the whole length of that eastern side <i>alongside the city</i> [of which a thousand cubits were directly opposite the city, and five hundred were above and below the city, as explained].</i> Similarly the expression, a hundred cubits long <i>‘lapei’ah ha’echath’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 27:9. See also Verses 11-13 <i>ibid.</i></i> means “for the whole ‘one’ side,” and so also similar expressions mentioned there [with reference to the dimensions of the Tabernacle]. This is also true of the term <i>pei’ah</i> at the end of the Book of Ezekiel<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel Chapter 48.</i> [with reference to the dimensions of the city of Jerusalem and the Sanctuary of the future]. Moreover, if the intent of the verse was to have been [as Rashi interpreted] that they were to assign <i>two</i> thousand cubits round about the city in each direction, He would have said, “And you shall measure without the city <i>‘l’pe’ath keidmah</i> (‘to’ the east side — two thousand cubits) etc.;” but instead He says [in Verse 5] <i>And you shall measure without the city ‘eth’ pe’ath keidmah</i>, which means “the measure of that [whole] side” [i.e., the whole distance along the eastern side of the outer square area, and also on each of the other outer sides, as the verse continues]. Such a four-sided plane figure having all its sides equal [and all its angles, right angles] is indeed a pleasingly suitable appearance for cities to have, not that they should measure two thousand cubits around the city in all directions [as explained by Rashi], thus eliminating the corners. A similar case is the expression, <i>It shall be eighteen thousand reeds round about</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 48.</i> which means that the city [of Jerusalem] will measure on all of its four sides together eighteen thousand reeds, since he [Ezekiel] assigned there for each of the four sides four thousand and five hundred [reeds]. Now it is correct to say that the thousand cubits which He assigned [in Verse 4] as open space directly round about the city that it is not to be planted, and the thousand cubits He added in the second verse at each of the outer sides [not directly opposite the city] be used for fields and vineyards, as our Rabbis have received by tradition. But the term <i>migrash</i> (open space) in Scriptural language applies to both, but in the one case [in the remote corners, not directly opposite the city] it may be cultivated and sown, whereas in the other case [in the <i>migrash</i> facing directly the city] it <i>may neither be plowed nor sown</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">64</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 21:4.</i> That is why Scripture separated them from each other [by giving two commands, in Verse 4 and in Verse 5, and not commanding both of them together].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\">With this interpretation Ramban solves the apparent contradiction between Verse 4 which speaks of the <i>migrash</i> as consisting of a thousand cubits and Verse 5 which assigns it to be two thousand. Ramban’s answer is that the term <i>migrash</i> applies to both — open space, and land for planting. Thus Verse 4 addresses itself to that <i>migrash</i> which was for open space, while Verse 5 speaks of the overall concept of <i>migrash</i> which includes both the thousand cubits of open space directly opposite the city, and the five hundred cubits above and below the city for planting, which total altogether two thousand cubits.</i>"

Ramban’s statement that “the number of cities which they gave to the Levites was <i>not</i> equal” is thus clear, as is proven in the cases of Judah, Shimon, and Naphtali.</i> according to the number of tribes, that was because of the [different] value of the particular cities, since some were more important than the others, for the Land was divided according to its value.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Baba Bathra 122a.

Judah (Verse 22 <i>ibid.</i>), Shimon (Verse 14), and Benjamin (Verse 41) totalled 144,300. Issachar (Verse 25), Asher (Verse 47), and Naphtali (Verse 50) totalled 163,100. The complete tribe of Menasheh (Verse 34) totalled 52,700. Assuming that the half-tribe of Menasheh mentioned in Joshua was exact half [i.e., 26,350] we have a total for the latter group mentioned of 189,450, which is far more than the 144,300 of the first group.</i> And from the tribe of Ephraim they gave four cities [to the Levites],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">72</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 21:20-22.</i> and from the tribe of Dan four cities,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">73</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 23-24.</i> and yet the children of Dan were double [the population] of the children of Ephraim.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">74</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The children of Ephraim totalled 32,500 (above, 26:37), while Dan totalled 64,400 (<i>ibid.</i>, Verse 43)!

If so, [we must say that] the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded this on account of the future [since He knew that murderers in Gilead would be numerous], similar to that which it says [of the future generations], <i>and this people will rise up, and go astray</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">77</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 31:16.</i> Or perhaps the Rabbis will say that the climate of the land of Gilead was conducive to producing murderers since it became a nation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">78</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 9:24.</i><br>But I wonder!

This was because, as the text continues, the larger part of the tribe was there; therefore, although their land was smaller, the number of cities they gave to the Levites equalled that of their brethren beyond the Jordan [each giving two cities]. This proves that the determining factor was not because in Gilead murderers were numerous and that therefore the two and a half tribes beyond the Jordan were given a larger proportion of cities of refuge.</i> because the majority of it was there [thus the nine tribes in the land of Canaan together with Menasheh were given thirty-six cities of refuge, i.e., those which constituted the cities of the Levites, plus the original three cities of refuge, making a total of thirty-nine].

Thus [it uses this expression] in connection with [the obligation of abstaining from work on the Festival of Shavuoth,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">95</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 23:21: <i>it is a statute forever in all your habitations throughout your generations</i>.</i> and in connection with the prohibition of [eating from] the new crop [before bringing the <i>omer</i> on the sixteenth day of Nisan],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 14. For the explanation of the word <i>omer</i>, see Vol. III, p. 368, Note 243.</i> in order to make [these laws] obligatory even outside the Land [of Israel] and even nowadays [when the Temple is destroyed], so that we should not [think that the prohibition against eating of the new crop is] dependent upon [the actual offering of] the <i>omer</i>, and [so that we should not make the commandment to abstain from work on Shavuoth dependent] upon the offering of <i>the new meal-offering</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">97</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 16.</i> [on that day]. Likewise [the expression <i>throughout your generations in all your habitations</i> is used] in connection with [the prohibition against eating certain] fats<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">98</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 3:17.</i> so that we should not think that it is dependent upon the offerings.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">99</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ramban’s emphasis on this point in Vol. III, pp. 85-88.</i> [And so here too the expression <i>throughout your generations in all your dwellings</i> would indicate that the execution of judgment including the death-penalty, applies at <i>all</i> times, and is <i>not</i> dependent upon the existence of the Sanctuary!] Perhaps the Rabbis interpreted the words [in our verse here]: <i>And these things shall be for a statute of judgment</i> [as referring not to the criminal cases mentioned in this section, but] to [the general law of] the Sanhedrin mentioned continually in this section, as it is said, [<i>until he stand</i>] <i>before ‘the congregation’ for judgment;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">100</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 12.</i> <i>then ‘the congregation’ shall judge</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">101</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 24.</i> and Scripture is thus saying that we should always have, throughout all generations, and even after the destruction [of the Sanctuary], “a congregation that judges” [i.e., a Sanhedrin, or court] in order to adjudicate upon the laws of fines, robberies, personal injury, and all monetary matters, and to deal with the law of forty stripes.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">102</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 25:3.

                    "AND YE SHALL TAKE NO RANSOM FOR THE LIFE OF A MURDERER etc. The correct interpretation of [the repetition of the phrase <i>ye shall take no ransom</i> in Verses 31-32] that at first [i.e., in the verse before us] He warned us against [pardoning] a <i>deliberate</i> murderer, [stating]: <i>And ye shall take no ransom</i> of monetary payment <i>for the life of a murderer, who is guilty of death, for he shall</i> under all circumstances <i>be put to death</i>, and shall not be saved from death by any means, neither by exile nor by stripes nor by any other punishment. And afterwards [in Verse 32] He stated, <i>And ye shall take no ransom</i> to allow him to flee [from the city of refuge] and return to live in the Land, <i>until the death of the priest</i>, and the verse thus refers back to those liable to exile [for unwitting murder] which He had [previously] mentioned, who are the main subject of this section. It is thus as if He would have said: And similarly you shall take no ransom from a murderer [who killed unwittingly] in order that he should flee [from his city of refuge] and return to live in the Land, before the death of the [High] Priest.” It was unnecessary to say that we should take no ransom from him [to free him] altogether from fleeing to the city of refuge, because anyone who kills somebody unwittingly is afraid at first that the avenger of blood might kill him in the heat of his anger, or [might kill him] because he suspected him of deliberate murder [and therefore he will always want at first to flee to the city of refuge]. Scripture, therefore, did not have to speak about [not taking] a ransom to free him altogether, but speaks only about [the prohibition against taking] a ransom after he has fled there, to enable him to return to his land, and so that he should not have to stay there [in the city of refuge] as long as the [High] Priest is alive. For[it is likely that he may desire to leave it, since] after he has fled [there] and stood [trial] <i>before the congregation for judgment</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">100</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 12.</i> and has been acquitted by them [of the charge of deliberate murder], he will no longer be afraid of the avenger of blood, and so he will want to return to his house before the due time [i.e., before the death of the High Priest]. Therefore Scripture warned us against [accepting from him <i>a ransom</i> or bribe for] this [purpose]. Or [it may be] that there is a letter <i>vav</i> “missing” from the word <i>lashuv</i> [in Verse 32 — so that it is as if it said <i>v’lashuv</i>] meaning “or to abide.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">103</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to this explanation, Verse 32 involves two separate prohibitions: 1) not to take a ransom from an unwitting killer not to go to a city of refuge, and 2) not to take a ransom from him to allow him to return from there before the death of the High Priest (Aboab). Ramban, however, as he states in his concluding words, prefers the first-mentioned interpretation that Verse 32 involves but one prohibition, namely, that we are not to take a ransom from an unwitting murderer after he has fled to the city of refuge to enable him <i>to return</i> to his land before the death of the High Priest. This interpretation is to be preferred apparently because it does not necessitate the introduction of a missing letter into the verse, as mentioned in the text.</i> But the first interpretation appears to me to be the correct one."

                    "V’LO THISOV NACHALAH’ (SO SHALL NO INHERITANCE) OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL MOVE FROM TRIBE TO TRIBE. Scripture was only concerned to improve the situation at that time [i.e., for the daughters of Zelophehad who had raised that problem]. For if there were [then] women in Israel [already] married to [men of] another tribe, and they [the women] inherited [a portion of the Land] at that time, or would inherit at some future time if their brothers or fathers died without sons, their inheritance would perforce move from one tribe to another [because their husbands, who were of a different tribe, or their sons, would inherit them when <i>they</i> died], and <i>who can straighten out</i> in time <i>what they have made crooked!</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">115</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ecclesiastes 7:13.</i> The Torah, furthermore, did not want to command that the sons or husbands of these women should not inherit them [if they were not of the same tribe], because it did not deem it fit to abrogate [in this case] the [regular] law of inheritance. Similarly Scripture did not concern itself with events which would occur in the future; for even if those daughters who do not possess an inheritance [before they are married] would be permitted to marry [men from] any of the tribes, yet it is possible that at some future time they might inherit some property, if [all] their brothers die in the lifetime of their father, and thus their father’s inheritance, or that of their relatives would pass on to them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">116</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, if not for the opinion of the Rabbis on the meaning of Scripture we could say that this prohibition is for all times, applying to such women as the daughters of Zelophehad who stood to be married and who already possessed an inheritance. But women who were already married at that time to men of other tribes and are [like the daughters of Zelophehad] inheriting now [because their fathers who were among those who left Egypt, died without sons], and similarly, women who stand to be married and may yet inherit their fathers if they die without sons — with all these possibilities Scripture was not concerned. Instead, the law for all times was specifically applying to women who stand to be married and have already an inheritance of the tribe, just like the daughters of Zelophehad. All this we might be inclined to say. But according to the opinion of our Rabbis etc. (see text) — (Kur Zahav, quoting Aboab).</i><br>But according to the opinion of our Rabbis who interpreted:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">117</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Baba Bathra 117a.</i> “This law<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">118</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “this thing,” based upon Verse 6 which reads: <i>‘This is the thing’ which the Eternal hath commanded concerning the daughters of Zelophehad</i> — that they marry men of their father’s tribe.</i> only applies to that particular generation,” it is possible<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">119</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The gist of Ramban’s thought is as follows: In the light of the saying of our Rabbis, that this law did not apply for all times [as explained above in Note 116] but only to that particular generation, it is possible then to say that Scripture was also concerned with the above-mentioned possibilities. As for those women who were already married to men of other tribes and are now inheriting, it is possible to say that there was no other case in that generation similar to that of Zelophehad’s daughters, the proof being that no other tribe complained. And as for the other possibility, of women who stand to be married and may yet inherit their fathers if they die without sons, we answer, G-d <i>in Whose hand</i> etc. (see text) — (Kur Zahav, in the name of Aboab).</i> that [at that time] there were no daughters who inherited a portion amongst all those who were to come into the Land [of Israel] except for the daughters of Zelophehad, and therefore [we do not find that] they [i.e., other women] asked [Moses about it as the daughters of Zelophehad did]. Scripture, then, is commanding that if anyone dies from that day onwards until the Land is divided up amongst their tribes, and his daughter inherits him, she should not marry [anyone] from another tribe, in order that when the Land is divided up, that man should not come to take himself an inheritance amongst another tribe. For the [Torah’s] concern about them [i.e., about the separate inheritance of each tribe] was greater at the time of the division of the Land [than afterwards], so that the [different] tribes should not become mixed up with each other when taking their inheritance, whereas afterwards their [separate] inheritance will have already become known, and they would not be so concerned about it. But since the [exact] time of the division [of the Land] was not yet known, He imposed the prohibition on the whole of that generation. And G-d <i>in Whose hand is the soul of every living thing</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">120</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 12:10. Ramban’s intent is to state that He <i>in Whose hand is the soul of every living thing</i> knew that “until the division of the Land no man would die without leaving a son, so that his daughters would be inheriting him” (Aboab). But such an assurance could naturally not apply if we were to say that the prohibition was for all generations.</i> did not have to be concerned with future events [which might in certain cases result in the transfer of a particular inheritance from one tribe to another].<br>This explanation is correct according to the plain meaning of Scripture, for [the phrase in Verse 9] <i>v’lo thisov nachalah</i> is not a reason [for prohibiting the marriage of a woman who has already an inheritance, with a man from another tribe] “in order that the inheritance shall not be moved [from tribe to tribe],” but there are two separate commandments [in this section]. He commanded [first, in Verses 6-8] that those women who already possess an inheritance [such as the daughters of Zelophehad, who were not married] should only marry into their father’s tribe, and then [in Verse 9] He commanded that [in the case of] those who are already married [to men of other tribes and have no inheritance], or [in the case of all those women] who will come into an inheritance [later on] after they marry a man [of another tribe], <i>the inheritance shall not move from one tribe to another tribe</i>, but their brothers or their relatives are to inherit them, and not their sons or their husbands. Thus at first [in Verses 6-7] He commanded [the law] in connection with the daughters of Zelophehad, and afterwards [in Verse 8] concerning <i>every daughter that possesseth an inheritance;</i> and then He said in connection with all Israel that <i>an inheritance shall not move from one tribe to another tribe</i> [as stated in Verse 9, meaning] that even in the case of women who are [already] married [to men of another tribe], or [unmarried] women who have been commanded [not to marry men of another tribe] and who transgress this commandment, the men of their tribes [i.e., the women’s brothers or other relatives] should inherit them, in order that they should be closely attached to the inheritance of their fathers’ tribes, and their inheritance should not be severed from them, nor they from the inheritance of their fathers. And all these [restrictions] applied only to the generation which took possession of the Land, at the time that it was divided up. Thus He advised them about unmarried women, concerning whom they had asked, and He also made provision for those that were already married.",
