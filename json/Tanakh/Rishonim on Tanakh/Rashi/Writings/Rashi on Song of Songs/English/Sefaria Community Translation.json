Although the Prophets have employed metaphors, let each metaphor be explained simply, each statement fitting its context.",

And Shlomo wrote this sefer prophetically, in the language of a widowed woman who longs for her husband, ‘who clings to her beloved’, remembering how she loved him in her youth, and [she] admits her failings. And even her Beloved is pained by her pain, and remembers the kindness of her youth, the comeliness of her beauty, and the quality of her deeds, in which he was bound up with her in intense love, and He tells her that He does not willfully bring her grief, and nor has she been sent away permanently, for she is still His wife, and He her husband, and he will return to her in the future.”"

And even with that reward you graze your kids at the ministers of nations and thus says Jeremiah (Jeremiah 31) \"Erect markers, Set up signposts; Keep in mind the highway, The road that you traveled.
