                "because a candle is a mitzvah and torah is light...As the light illuminates forever so the torah stands in its merit forever for a person and the merit of a mitzvah is according to its hour like the light of a candle.  Another explanation: because a candle is a mitvah etc... the commandment of a father is like a candle and all who fulfills his fathers commands it is as if he takes a candle in his hand to light up a dark place, and if he loses anything there he finds it in the light of this candle, and so for anyone who fulfills the teachings of his mother, her light it is for him, and so proverbs says, do not abandon the torah of your mother....."
