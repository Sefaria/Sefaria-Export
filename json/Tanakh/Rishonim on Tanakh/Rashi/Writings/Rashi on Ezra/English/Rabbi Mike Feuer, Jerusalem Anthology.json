                "Then – Then the work of building the House of God, which was in Jerusalem, ceased until the second year of Darius king of Persia. After Cyrus reigned Ahasuerus, who took Esther, and after Ahasuerus reigned Darius the son of Ahasuerus – who was also the son of Esther. From the first year of Cyrus king of Persia until the second year of Darius was eighteen years which completed the seventy years of Jerusalem’s destruction. From the destruction of the Temple, when Tzidkiyahu was exiled until the first year of Cyrus, was fifty-two years as it says in Seder Olam. Together with the eighteen years from the first of Cyrus until the second year of Darius this makes seventy whole years, and in the second year of Darius they began to build the building until they finished it:"
