The Talmud, Maseches, Temurah 16A, relates the following: Rav Yehudah said in the name of Rav, “When Moshe was about to leave this world, he said to Yehoshua, ‘Do you have any questions regarding the laws of the Torah? Ask me about them and I will teach them to you now.’ Yehoshua replied, ‘Rebbe! Did I leave your presence even for an hour? Did I ever travel to another place? Did you yourself not write about me in the Torah, “But his servant Yehoshua, son of Nun, a young man never departed from the Tabernacle.’” (Shemos 33:11) Thus Yehoshua implied that since he served Moshe faithfully for forty years and had studied Torah diligently, there was nothing that he did not know. This was considered a sin for Yehoshua and as a result, he immediately forgot three hundred laws, and seven hundred additional laws became unclear to him. During the month of mourning for Moshe, the Bnei Yisroel forgot many more laws. A total of three thousand laws were forgotten during this period. Rav Avahu said, “Nevertheless they were brought back by Osniel, son of Kenaz through his dialectic scholarship, as it is said, “And Osniel, son of Kenaz, conquered it (Kiryas Seifer).” After Caleiv conquered Chevron he approached the scholars in the Beis Midrash who were called יוֹשְׁבֵי דְבִיר, those who sit in Devir, because they sat all day studying דִבְרֵי תוֹרָה, the <i>words</i> of Torah, and challenged them to rediscover the forgotten laws. He announced that the one who would overcome, וּלְכָדָה (conquer) these problems would be worthy to become his son-in-law.</i>"
