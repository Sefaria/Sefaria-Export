According to their opinion, one can say that his hiding was not because of Yeihu, rather the following is its explanation: “And he sought Achazyohu, and they captured him when he was escaping by way of the garden.” He had been acting wickedly from the beginning, for he would come to Shomron and hide from the officers of Yehudah, to commit this abomination, because the inhabitants of Shomron were idolaters. “And they brought him to Yeihu,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ibid.</i> [i.e.,] Yeihu’s men, who had pursued him, [after which it states,] “And he said, ‘Strike him in the chariot.’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Alternatively, Achazyohu was wounded on the way up to Gur, and he fled to Megido where his condition worsened.

The Gemara in Maseches Horiyos 10a explains that Uzziyohu became “free” of the duties of being king. Targum indicates that he lived outside the walls of Yerusholayim. The reason is because a <i>metzora</i> is forced to live in isolation. He was therefore unable to attend to his royal duties and was thus “freed” from his responsibilities.</i> <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The house was in the cemetery because our Rabbis taught in Maseches Nedarim 12b that a <i>metzora</i> is accounted as dead. And like the dead who is free from the many toils of life, as it states in Tehilim 88:6, “I am [considered] among the dead who are free,” so is a <i>metzora</i>.</i> as it is stated, ”I am [considered] among the dead who are free.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tehilim 88:6.</i> In [Talmud] Yerushalmi."
