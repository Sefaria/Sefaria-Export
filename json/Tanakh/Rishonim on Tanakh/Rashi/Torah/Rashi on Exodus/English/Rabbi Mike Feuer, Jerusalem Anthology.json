                "the sanctuary – There is a zakaf gadol as the cantillation on this word in order to separate it from the word after it, meaning: the sanctuary which your hands founded, O Lord. The Holy Temple is particularly beloved because the world was created with one hand, as it says “Even My hand laid the foundation of the earth…” (Yeshayahi 48:13) while the Holy Temple was created with two hands. When will it be built with two hands? When Gd is king forever, in the time to come when all the kingship is his."
