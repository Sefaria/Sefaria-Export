And these are the thirteen exclusions: “[when Moshe came into the Tent of Meeting that] He might speak <i>to him</i>, [he heard the voice] uttering itself <i>to him</i> [from above the cover of the Ark of Testimony from between the two <i>cherubim,</i>] speaking <i>to him</i>,” “and I will meet with you” (לְךָ), all of them as [interpreted] in <i>Toras Kohanim.</i> <i data-commentator=\"Siftei Chakhamim\" data-label=\"⚬\"></i>Perhaps they heard the <i>sound</i> of the calling, [though not the exact words]?

Another interpretation: When Aharon saw that they offered all the sacrifices, and all the rituals had been performed, and [still] the <i>Shechinoh</i> did not descend for Israel, he was pained, and thought, “I know that God is angry with me and [it is] because of me that the Shechinoh did not descend for Israel”!

Therefore he said to them: “This is what Adonoy commanded you to do and the glory of Adonoy will appear to you.

If so, why does the verse say, “and behold, it spread”? This is not the place of this verse, but “and he shall dismantle the house” should have been written after <i data-commentator=\"Siftei Chakhamim\" data-label=\"⚬\"></i>“and if the eruption returns.” “And [the <i>kohein</i> shall come] and see,” and behold the eruption has spread” therefore comes to teach only regarding an eruption which remains unchanged in his sight during the first week, and he comes at the end of the second week <i data-commentator=\"Siftei Chakhamim\" data-label=\"⚬\"></i>and finds that it spread. For previously the Torah did not explain anything regarding if the eruption remained [unchanged] in his sight during the first week — and it teaches you here in regard to this spreading, that it speaks only regarding [an eruption] which remained unchanged during the first and spread during the second. What should he do with it? Perhaps he dismantles it, as [laid down by the verse] adjacent to it: “and he shall dismantle the house”? The verse says: “and the <i>kohein</i> shall return,” “and the <i>kohein</i> shall come.” We learn “coming” from “returning,” just as [in] “returning” he removes [the affected stones] and scrapes and plasters and gives it another week, so [in regard to] “coming” he removes [the affected stones] and scrapes and plasters and gives it another week — if it returns he dismantles; if it does not return, [the house] is [ritually] pure. And from where [do we know] that if it remained [unchanged] during this [week] and that [week], he removes [the affected stones] and scrapes and plasters <i data-commentator=\"Siftei Chakhamim\" data-label=\"⚬\"></i>and gives it a week? The verse says, (“he shall come”) “and if he shall come and see.” In [regard to] what is the verse speaking? <i data-commentator=\"Siftei Chakhamim\" data-label=\"⚬\"></i>If regarding [a case] where [the eruption] spread during the first [week], it was already mentioned. If regarding [a case] where [the eruption] spread during the second [week], it was already mentioned. <i data-commentator=\"Siftei Chakhamim\" data-label=\"⚬\"></i>Thus, (“he shall come”) “and if he shall come” must deal with [a case] in which [the <i>kohein</i>] came at the end of the first week, and came at the end of the second week, and saw, and behold! It had not spread. What does he do in the case of this unchanged [eruption]? Perhaps he should just leave, as it is said here, “and he shall declare the house pure”? The verse says, “for the eruption has healed” — I have declared clean only that which is [totally] healed. What shall he do with it? “Coming” is mentioned above and “coming” is mentioned below; just as the one above he removes [the affected stones], scrapes, plasters and gives it another week — for he learns [a גְזֵרָה שָׁוָה]: “This is ’returning,’ this is ‘coming’” — so [too] regarding the [case] below, etc. as it is in Toras Kohanim. In conclusion, dismantling [is carried out] only with an eruption which returns after removal [of the affected stones], scraping and replastering, and the [eruption] which returns does not require “spreading.” The order of verses is as such: “And if it returns” “he shall dismantle,” “whoever will come inside the house,” “whoever will eat inside the house,” “the <i>kohein</i> shall come and see, and behold! It has spread,” and the verse speaks of [an eruption] which remains [unchanged] during the first [week], that he gives it a second week of confinement, and at the end of the second week of its confinement, [the <i>kohein</i>] comes and sees that it spread. What shall he do to it? He removes [the affected stones], scrapes, replasters and gives it a week. [If] it returns, he dismantles [the house]; [if] it does not return, it requires [purification with] birds, for, [cases of] eruptions [do not last] longer than three weeks. "
