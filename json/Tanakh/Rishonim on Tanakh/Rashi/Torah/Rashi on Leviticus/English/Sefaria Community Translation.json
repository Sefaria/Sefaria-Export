It is spoken of in generalities and specifics and its details from Sinai. Even so all of them (the commandments) are spoken of in their generalities and details from Sinai, thus it is taught in Torat Kohamin (Leviticus).  And it appears to me that  that thus is its explanation: since we do not find the Sabbatical year for the soil that was taught on the plains of Moab in the book of Deuteronomy.  That is to teach us that all of its details and its specifics were spoken at Sinai.  And Scripture comes and teaches here on every speech that was attributed to Moses, that from Sinai was it given, all of their generalities and their details, and that they were repeated again on the plains of Moab.
