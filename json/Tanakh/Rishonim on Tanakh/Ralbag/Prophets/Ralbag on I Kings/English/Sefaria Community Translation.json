Therefore his servants requested for him something that would provide him with warmth. And they chose for him that he would be warmed by the warmth of a young virgin for many reasons - first, that she would warm him (physically), second, that she would excite the man and arouse him for sex, and third that it would arouse his nature because of her beauty and her being a virgin, and this would cause him to warm himself.

And moreover he was very handsome, and on account of his beauty he thought himself fitting to rule.  ",
                "<b>And he was born after Absalom:</b> It is impossible to explain that we should understand from this the matter of their birth, because Absalom was the son of Maacah (2 Samuel 3:3), while Adonijah was the son of Haggith (2 Samuel 3:4).  If this was in regard to the matter of their birth, it would have been fitting for the two of them to be born from one mother, Adonijah after Absalom.  Therefore it is to be explained that this is in regard to their upbringing, as was stated: \"and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Adriel [the son of Barzillai] the Meholathite\" (2 Samuel 21:8), which is in regard to upbringing as was stated previously (Ralbag on 2 Samuel 21:8).  The intended meaning is that his mother raised him in the same manner as Absalom, and he behaved with the same customs and personality.  Therefore it said, \"and he was also a very goodly man\" like Absalom, who was very handsome, as was recalled previously. Thus, just as Absalom thought that he would rule after David because of his great beauty, Adonijah thought likewise."

Thus he thought that just as these men had helped David attain kingship and to succeed, they would do the same for him.  For example, when Abiathar came to David as he was fleeing from Saul (1 Samuel 22:20), David would do everything according to him. And Joab established David upon the throne of the kingdom and fought his wars against Ish-bosheth (2 Samuel 2:8-9) and Absalom (2 Samuel 18:2) and Sheba son of Bichri (2 Samuel 20:1). And Joab likewise was drawn to Adonijah and helped him with the kingdom in order that he would love him and not remove him from being chief of the army when it was clear to him that David intended to remove him from his position due to the matter of Absalom. And Abiathar the priest also [followed Adonijah] when he saw that David was giving more honor and standing to Zadok than he was giving to Abiathar. And this is explained in the preceding stories in which David appointed Zadok and Abiathar. "

(1 Chronicles 17:11) And in general he did not call those that would assent to his counsel like Zadok the priest, Benaiah son of Johoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and the mighty men that belonged to David because he knew that they would confound his counsel and, as a result, renew the hatred of the people who had agreed to his plan."

Because of reverence for the king they will be afraid to say anything against him or have this intention. \"'I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders' if you do not disclose this (that you intend for him to be king) while you're alive, because the good gift that you gave us is being exploited from us, and it should not be an incriminating thing for us for the matter to be revealed that your intention is to coronate us as you spoke and swore to your maidservant.\""

The anointing was not done thus with everything that Moses had done. Therefore it is explained that he would only do a partial anointing, that it anointing the king on his head, as it said about Saul, \"Samuel took the vial of oil and poured it upon his head.\"(1 Samuel 10:1) It is fitting that anointing should be upon the place where the crown of kingship will be. And it is fitting that you know that it was only necessary to anoint Solomon because of the conflict with Adonijah, because with the anointing of David, all those after him from his line were also anointed, like with the anointing of Aaron and his sons, all those coming after them to be priests were also anointed.
