The simple explanation is that it tasted like wafers in honey when eaten whole, just as nuts taste sweet before they are ground. But in Bamidbar it is written that they “ground it with a millstone or crushed it in mortars.” Through these processes it acquired an oily taste, just as nuts and olives exude oil when crushed."
