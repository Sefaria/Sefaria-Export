The word תקופה, a season, is a period of 91 days. Seeing that Samuel was born after 2 such תקופות he was born after 182 days of pregnancy. [perhaps the fact that the Torah did not mention that the time for Moses to be born had arrived, as happens very often, is another support for the assumption that he was 3 months premature. Ed.] At any rate, she had nothing to fear during the three months she hid Moses at home as the Egyptians had not expected Yocheved to give birth until the end of that period of time. When Yocheved had noted that in spite of being born so much prematurely, Moses was fully formed in every way, she decided it was worthwhile to hide him and to hope that somehow he would be spared from the decree. When an inspector would show up, she would tell the inspector that he had been premature and incapable of living so that she had had to bury him or that the Egyptians had drowned him anyway."

Who does not know that when someone would open the basket that he or she would see the infant? Surely, the Torah did not have to tell us something so elementary! Therefore, the meaning of the line is this: when she opened the basket and saw the infant and wanted to know if it was male or female, she found that the baby was a נער, that it was male and not female. When she also observed that his member had been circumcised, she realised that this baby had not been abandoned but had been hidden in the reeds. If she would have found that the baby was a girl, she would have assumed that it had been abandoned (as an illegitimate birth) There is nothing unusual about an infant being called נער, as we find Manoach asking the angel who had predicted the birth of Simshon  מה נעשה לנער אשר יולד,”what shall we do for the boy once he will be born?” (Judges 13,8).",

We find something parallel in Samuel I 1,5 where we are told ולחנה יתן מנה אחת אפים, that Elkanah would give his wife Chanah a double portion, the reason being explained later with the words: כי את חנה אהב “for he deeply loved Chanah.” This is all very fine, but why does the prophet stress the word אחת in the description מנה אחת אפים, “one portion twice,” instead of writing שתי מנות, “two portions?” The reason is that although she was childless her husband gave her a double portion (only), whereas Peninah, having numerous children received far more than 2 portions. Elkanah compensated Chanah for her childlessness. Here the daughter of Pharaoh reacted to the miserable condition Moses found himself in. "

Ed.] Nowhere in our traditional literature of Tannaim and Amoraim (Talmud) is there such a view expressed, and we certainly have no reason to accept such views when they are expressed in hagiographical writings.

If this were to lead us to assume that Chevron had no sons, the Torah in Numbers 26,58 adds details under the heading: “and the family of Uzziel, etc.” This raises the question why the Torah kept silent about these details at this point. The reason appears to be that the names of the sons of Chevron do not appear in connection with any of their activities elsewhere in the Torah, whereas the names of the ones mentioned here appear also in their own right, not only as sons of their respective fathers. Amram appears as father of Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.

                "מסתולל,  the reflexive mode of the verb סלל as in סולו סולו דרך הרימו מכשול, “pave, pave a way and remove every obstacle, etc.,” (Isaiah 62,10). Just as the stones are pressed together to remove them as obstacles, so Pharaoh squeezed the Israelites so that they could not offer any resistance. Compare also Jeremiah 34,11 ויכבשום לעבדים ולשפחות, they “compressed” them into becoming male and female slaves. Concerning the grammatical principles underlying the use of the reflexive conjugation mitpael, every time this conjugation appears it has the letter ת preceding the first root letter, except the ones that have that letter at the end instead of at the beginning. Examples of the former are Psalms 94,4 יתאמרו כל פעלי און Words such as יתברך, יתגדל or in Ezekiel 38,23 והתגדלתי והתקדשתי, or Jeremiah 9,23 יתהלל המתהלל, or מתפלל in Exodus 10,2. The author lists a few more examples, showing that all of the letters of the aleph bet except the 7 letters ד'זט ס'ץ ש'ת, follow this pattern. When the first root letter is either a ש or a ת, the letter ת is appended at the end instead of at the beginning. The exception is a word whose root begins with the letter ס. One such example is our verse, the root being סל. The basic meaning is parallel to Numbers 16,13 תסתרר עלינו, where the word תסתורר is derived from the root שר. In examples such as ישתבח, ישתמר or משתכר, all of which have roots beginning with the letter ש, the letter ת signaling the conjugation התפעל is deferred until after the first root letter. In roots commencing with the letter ז or צ, no such letter ת signaling the reflexive conjugation appears at all. Instead, after the letter צ the letter ט is added to show us that we deal with the reflexive conjugation. Well known examples of these constructions are found in Genesis 44,16 נצטדק from the root צדק, and Joshua 9,12 הצטיידנו from the root ציד, provisions. Concerning the words with the first root letter ז, the letter signaling the reflexive conjugation is a ד, as in Daniel 2,9 הזדמנתון. The letters ד-ט-ת, by themselves when they appear at the beginning of the word, do not get an additional letter to indicate that the construction in which they appear is a reflexive conjugation. A prominent example of this is Numbers 7,89 וישמע את הקול מדבר, where the Torah did not write מתדבר. Another such example is Leviticus 21,4 לא יטמא בעל בעמיו, where because the root טמא begins with the letter ט the Torah did not write יתטמא, although the verb is in the reflexive mode, of course. The same is true in Samuel II 22,27 where the word תתפל in the line ועם עקש תתפל, does not have another letter ת at the beginning in order to signal that the verb is in the reflexive mode. [The author illustrated his point with still more examples, but I think he made his point adequately with the examples I have cited. Ed.]"

Whenever the Torah refers to an event by naming the month in which it occurred or would occur, the ordinal number used is relative to this month, the month of Nissan, which rates as the “first” month. This is spelled out even more clearly in Exodus 19,1 בחודש השלישי לצאת בני ישראל ממצרים, “in the third month, after the Exodus of the Children of Israel from Egypt.” The date of the Exodus from Egypt remained uppermost in the way our prophets recorded important historical events, as for instance, in Kings I 6,1 when the completion of Solomon’s Temple is dated as having occurred in the 480th year after the Exodus from Egypt."

It is not so out of character for the Torah when quoting people, to describe what they said in the language in which it was said. Examples are: Genesis 31,47 where the words יגר שהדותא for the monument erected by Lavan and called Galed by Yaakov, is repeated verbatim in the local language Lavan spoke. When, in the Book of Esther 3,7 we read about a פור, which means “lots” in English, but is the Persian equivalent, this reflects what was familiar to people in that region and at that time. Esther and Mordechai did not have to use this Persian term at all. All they had to write was what they did write in explaining the meaning of the word, i.e. הוא הגורל, “that is the lot.” After all, the entire Book of Esther with the exception of a couple of words is written in Hebrew.

Ed.] This is also what is spelled out in verse 16. 'ויאמר כי יד על כס י-ה וגו, this is why I call the altar ה' נסי, “G’d is my banner, my flag.” This is the same as when a father calls his son Eliezer, which means the same thing in Hebrew. (compare Exodus 18,4 where the reason for Moses calling his son by that name is explained.) Also the name Emanuel means the same, i.e. two words עמנו א-ל, “G’d is with us.” (Isaiah 7,14) G’d raised His hand in an oath, swearing by His throne that He would conduct ongoingמלחמה לה' בעמלק מדר דר, war against Amalek throughout the generations until he would be wiped out completely. Invoking the word יד here in connection with G’d’s utterance (as opposed to visible action) is the same as the line כי אשא אל שמים ידי, “I raise My hand to heaven” in Deuteronomy 32,40 it clearly is the formula for G’d swearing an oath. This is the plain meaning of these words. There are some who explain that when a king will sit on the throne of Israel, such as King Sha-ul, the time will have come to wipe out Amalek completely. I cannot accept this interpretation at all, as if it were correct, the Torah should have written כי תהיה יד אל כס י-ה “when the throne of Israel will be occupied by a real powerful king, representing G’d on earth.” The meaning of the words כי יד על כס י-ה is: “whenever a deliberate threat is posed against the kingdom of G’d on earth, etc.”"

We find something similar reported of Pharaoh giving his daughter, Solomon’s wife, Gezer Chazor and Megiddo as a dowry. in Kings I 9,15. The former interpretation in the plain meaning of our verse. There would be no point is Yitro bringing Tzipporah back to her husband, when we had never heard that Moses had sent her back to her father in the first place.

[a rejection of Rashi’s commentary who understands the word יוכל as “having permission.” Ed.] There is nothing wrong with repeating warnings to people when the time of paying with their lives for warnings which they have ignored draws near. G’d Himself repeated instructions to Moses in verse 24 when He told him to descend and to allow only Aaron to approach a little closer to the mountain. What news did this verse contain? The point is that Moses’ remarks were a question. He asked if G’d had added an additional restriction to what He had issued on the previous two days when He had said in verse 12 that touching the mountain would prove lethal?שלא יוכל העם לעלות אל הר סיני, Moses wanted clarification of the expression פן יהרסו ממנו רב, as opposed to השמרו לכם עלות בהר.

G’d told him that while it was all right for Aaron to approach a little closer, neither the priests nor the people at large were allowed to come within a certain distance of the base of the mountain.

The term אלפים mentioned here is equivalent to the אלף דור, 1000 generations  mentioned in the parallel version of the Ten Commandments in Deuteronomy 7,9. The two verses need not be a contradiction to one another according to the simple meaning of the text. Here the Torah mentions children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren. All “children” are part of the same generation. All grandchildren are the same but second generation. The children after the 1000th generation are referred to as אלפים, or “the plural mode of one thousand.” In Deuteronomy, where children and grandchildren have not even been mentioned, and no mention is made of third and fourth generations, only the final generation to whom G’d extends such love is mentioned. Hence it is natural that this “final” generation qualifying for this loving care by G’d is called אלף דור, i.e. this generation being the children of the 1000th generation.

Seeing that both are followed immediately by the command לקדשו “to sanctify it,” (the Sabbath) this makes an imperative of the whole paragraph. The Torah, in a way, commands us to “commemorate” something which G’d had done long before  there was a legislation to observe the Sabbath as a day of rest. Already when creating the “day” He had blessed it, i.e. made provisions for those who would observe it not to be deprived by their observance but to find that G’d in His generosity had provided the needs for the people in question. Observing, emulating something G’d had done, is a way of honouring Him. He “ worked” for 6 days before “resting,” so do we as a way of honouring Him."

Concerning the use of the word רוצח, murderer, in Deuteronomy 4,42 as applicable to someone who killed inadvertently, the reason why the Torah used this term there was only because in the same context deliberate murder was also discussed. This is my answer to the heretics who have admitted to me that the Latin translation of the Bible describing רציחה “killing,” without distinction as to the reason for the killing, is sloppy, most inaccurate. They were so careless in spit of the fact that in their “own” books such as Deuteronomy 32,39 we have the line אני אמית ואחיה, “it is I Who kill and resurrect,” showing that the Torah uses different expressions describing different kinds of killing."

According to the plain meaning of the text there were actually three bolts which qualify for the description בריח התיכון, “the central bolt.” One of them ran from north to south, and the other two ran from east to west parallel to each other on the two long walls of the Tabernacle. Seen in such a way, the Tabernacle was kept solid by the manner in which the corner planks were fitted to each other.

The makers of the mould recessed the shape of a calf in the bottom of the mould. Afterwards, the gold was thrown into this mould. Once it had melted in the crucible into which the mould was placed, the gold had assumed the shape of a calf when retrieved from the crucible after it had cooled. (verse 24) A similar procedure is described in Kings II 5,23  [this interpretation of that verse by our author is most unusual. Ed.]",
                "אלה אלוהיך ישראל אשר העלוך, were the Israelites all idiots that they would accept such a statement? Had they not all experienced the miracles performed by the G’d of Israel only less than 3 months ago?The declaration is to be understood as based on the premise subscribed to by most idolaters that while it is true that there is a G’d in heaven Who had created the universe, the teraphim were held to possess divine powers, exercising same just as did the prophets who performed miracles. The former were agents of spiritually negative forces, known in our parlance as רוח הטומאה, the prophets performed their miracles by invoking the spiritually positive forces, G’d in heaven. The people who had made the golden calf, or who had seen it emerge from the mould, proclaimed that the same force which had produced the golden calf had also been instrumental in freeing the Jewish people from the enslavement by the Egyptians. They implied that such teraphim may sometimes be the embodiment of holy spirit, other times of Satan’s spirit. They insisted that seeing that the calf had materialised at the time when the Jewish people were in need of a replacement for Moses, this was proof that it was a replacement for Moses, and if they would now carry the golden calf in front of them, or have it walk in front of them, this would be equivalent having the holy spirit walking ahead of them. [I fleshed out the author’s words. Ed.] We know that Lavan (Genesis 31,30) accused Yaakov of having stolen his “gods” which was the description he gave to his “teraphim.” He himself had admitted that Yaakov’s G’d had enriched him, and yet for himself he paid heed to these teraphim. If G’d allowed the spiritually negative forces to appear as possessing divine powers, He did so in order to test the loyalty of the Jewish people who had been warned not to have any truck with witchcraft or those who practiced this art. Moses spells all this out in Deuteronomy 13,4. The prohibition against אוב, ידעוני, and a variety of different demonic and other sorcery performing spirits has been repeated in the Torah several times. Loyalty of the people to their G’d can be proven only when alternative sources of what one desires are offered or appear as being offered. \n"

                "הראני נא את כבודך, at first glance we must surely wonder how Moses could have had the audacity to demand to see G’d and to ask for such as a means to derive personal satisfaction from it. It is totally incompatible with the attitude Moses displayed at the burning bush when the very thought of seeing something Divine filled him with fear and he was afraid to look. (Exodus 3,6). There can be no question but that what motivated Moses to formulate the above request was only that G’d would fulfil his two wishes, 1) to distinguish him individually, and 2) to personally travel with the people. To this effect he added הראני נא את כבודך, referring to previous occasions when a covenant had been concluded between G’d and Avraham, and as a sign of this Avraham had witnessed the entire procedure of the covenant between the pieces in Genesis 15,18. Moses, as Avraham before him, asked for some sign that the covenant would endure. We read about this occurring in 34,6 and 10 where Moses has a special personal revelation which includes G’d revealing to him 13 of His attributes, each of which is of relevance when inducing forgiveness and repentance. In verse 10 in that chapter G’d promises to make this special relationship manifest by hitherto unheard of miracles. The distinction G’d provided for Moses personally was such that the people did not dare approach him as the light radiating from his forehead blinded them (34,30) \n"

Later on, the cloud moved from being over the Tabernacle and filling the whole Tabernacle with its presence and concentrated on being above the Holy Ark. This has been explained in Exodus 25,22 where the Torah defines the site of the Shechinah as being between the two cherubs on the kapporet, the lid of the Holy Ark. Moses is described as hearing the voice of G’d originating from the area between the extended wings of these two figurines. (Numbers 7,89) We find something similar when the Temple Solomon had built was inaugurated  (Kings I 8,11) that the priests could not enter due to the presence of G’d which filled the Temple. G’d also had appeared in a cloud, much as He had in the desert. Subsequently, He reduced His presence to the area we just described, enabling the priests to perform their duties. Anyone who pays careful attention to the words of our Creator will not depart in his exegesis from that of my grandfather Rabbi Shlomoh (Rashi). Most of the laws of the Torah which have been attributed through exegesis as being derived from the text of the written Torah are very close to the plain meaning of the written text. The basic approach to his exegesis was to derive meanings from superfluous words or letters, or from missing words or letters in the text of the written Torah. It would be well if you also accepted what I have explained and you would do well not to ignore it. [the author paraphrases Kohelet 7,18. Ed]\n"
