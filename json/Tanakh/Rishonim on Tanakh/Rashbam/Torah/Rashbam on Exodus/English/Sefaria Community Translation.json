All babies elicit the compassion of their mothers. Rather one must explain [the verb] SHE SAW (ותרא) like in the verse (Gen. 1:31), \"God saw (יארע) all that he had made and found it very good.\" There the phrase means that [God] looked and examined all His works and His actions that He had done to see whether there was something to correct therein; everything was proper and correct. Here also, since Moses was born [prematurely] after [a pregnancy of only] six months--just as we find that Samuel was born [after a six-month pregnancy, as it is written (I Sam. 1:20) לתקופות הימים i.e. after two tequfot and two [more] days. That is why she [Moses' mother] was able to hide him for three months, for the Egyptians used to check the pregnant women [only at the anticipated end of a full term pregnancy] at the end of nine months. Accordingly, [since he was born so prematurely] she examined him when he was born to see whether he was a stillborn that need not be hidden. But she saw that he was fine and good-looking, for his signs of maturity, which are his hair and fingernails--as we learned in Yevamot (80b )--were completed. So she knew that he was capable of surviving ",

For doesn't everybody know that, if she opened the basket, she would see the child? Rather, this is its explanation: she opened the basket and looked at the child to see whether it was male or female, and she saw that it was a na'ar. In other words, this child is male and not female. And she saw on his maleness [i.e., his penis] that he was circucised, and so he was [intentionally] hidden and was not a foundling [i.e., abandoned]. For if he had been a girl, it would stand to reason that he was a foundling. And in fact we have found that it is written (Jud. 13:8), \"What shall we do with the na'ar who is to be born?\" -- on the day of his birth, he is [already] called a na'ar.  ",
                "(2) HERE THERE WAS A BOY CRYING, AND SHE HAD COMPASSION ON HIM, ETC. It was because he was crying that she had compassion on him. And because she saw a na'ar, male and circumcised, she said, \"This must be a Hebrew child.\" It is similar to the following (I Sam. 1:5), \"And to Hannah, he would give an apayim portion [JPS: one portion only]\" -- a choice portion. Why? \"Because [JPS: although] he loved Hannah,\" and thus he gave her apayim from the platter that was in front of him. If so, why a single portion? Because Adonai had closed off her womb, but to P'ninah and all her daughters and sons, he gave \"portions\" -- many -- because she had many children. \"And she saw the child, that he was a na'ar, crying.\""
