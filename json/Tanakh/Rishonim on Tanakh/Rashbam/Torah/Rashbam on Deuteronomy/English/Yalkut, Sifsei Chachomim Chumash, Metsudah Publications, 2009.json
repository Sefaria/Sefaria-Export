They should not think that since Moshe’s prayer saved them from such a big sin as the Golden Calf, so too in the land of Israel, if they sin the prophets will pray for them and save them. Moshe said to them that such prayers will not work in the land of Israel, for now Moshe atoned for them in order that they not profane Hashem’s name. Here Moshe prayed, “Recall Your servants… lest they say of the land.” For this reason they were saved from death. But once the thirty one Canaanite kings have been vanquished and Hashem has caused them to inherit the land, he can then throw them out and exile them from the land. This would not profane Hashem’s name, the nations will not be able to say “Because of Hashem’s inability to bring them to the land.” Rather the gentile nations will understand that it is because the Jews sinned, as explained in Parshas Nitzovim, “They will reply, ‘Because they forsook the covenant of Hashem’ ” (Devarim 29:24)."
