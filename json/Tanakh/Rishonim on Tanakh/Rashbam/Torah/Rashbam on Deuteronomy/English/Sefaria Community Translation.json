                "THESE ARE THE WORDS. According to its straightforward sense, all of the items mentioned in this verse are place names, as we find is common for verses to provide identification after identification as to which it wants to explain where they are.  As in Lech L'cha (Gen. 12:8):  \"east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east.\"  [In Parashat B'shalah:] (Ex. 14:2)  \"turn back and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal-zephon.\"  In the book of Judges (21:19):  \"The annual feast of the LORD is now being held at Shiloh.  (It lies north of Bethel, east of the highway that runs from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah.)\"  And all the more necessary it is to specify the locations where the mitzvot were spoken, as it is written (Lev. 25:1) \"The LORD spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai\"; (Ex. 12:1-2) \"in the land of Egypt: This month shall mark for you\"; (Num. 33:50) \"In the steppes of Moab.\"  Likewise here, it makes identification after identification.  And it similarly states and repeats and reiterates this matter when Moshe comes to elaborate the commandments (Deut. 4:45-46):  \"these are the decrees, laws, and rules that Moses addressed ... beyond the Jordan, in the valley at Beth-peor, in the land of King Sihon of the Amorites.\"  [And (Deut. 1:5) \"On the other side of the Jordan, in the land of Moab,] Moses undertook [to expound this Teaching.]",
                "ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE JORDAN.  On which \"other side of the Jordan\"?  ",
                "IN THE WILDERNESS.  On that \"other side of the Jordan\" that is on the side of the wilderness where Israel was for 40 years, which is called the \"other side of the Jordan\" for the residents of the Land of Israel, and not the \"other side of the Jordan\" that is the Land of Israel side, for it is also called the \"other side of the Jordan\" for those who are going through the wilderness where Israel was.

Zion, which is shamem,\" and in the category of doubles [a three-letter root with the second and third letters the same], and it means that He raised His voice to make a great noise in the war to the extent of destroying them.  And if the meaning of the final mem were like \"otam\" [\"them\"] [i.e., a pronominal object suffix], it should have written \"v'hamamam.\"  However, from the root heh-mem-heh, [the basis of] \"yehemeh libi\" (Jer. 48:36 [reversed]), one could say \"v'hamam,\" [i.e.,] \"v'hamah otam,\" as from \"asah\" [he made], [we derive] \"otz'bi asam\" (Isa. 48:5 -- \"my idol made them\"), and from \"When Ya'akov saw [ra'ah]\" (Gen. 29:10) [we derive] \"And Ya'kov said when he saw them (ra'am)\" (Gen. 32:3) -- \"ra'ah otam.\"  And \"hamam\" from the root h-m-h would be explained \"hamah otam.\"  And if you say that this [the actual word in our verse] should also be interpreted as \"hamah otam,\" you can't say that, because the word himyon [making a loud noise] is intransitive:  \"My mind yehemeh like a harp\" (Jer. 48:36, modified) -- of its own.  If the action was done to something else [i.e., if it were a transitive verb], one would have to make it a stronger conjugation [a pi'el]: v'himem.

[Another example:] \"yishneh [debased, changed] is the finest gold\" (Lam. 4:1) -- by itself, thus the soft conjugation [a kal]; but [done] to others it would say \"v'shinah [changed] his prison garments\" (II Kings 25:29) or \"vay'shaneha [he treated her differently] and her maids\" (Esth. 2:9)."

It should have said this above [i.e., in v.18], and it would not have been necessary to go back and repeat it to make it known to Israel that \"this is what I prayed.\" However, there is great wisdom here: you might say, isn't it true that, just as in the case of the great sin in the incident of the Calf, Moshe's prayer was efficacious and we were saved, so also in the Land of Israel, if we sin, the prayers of the prophets will be efficacious? Moshe said to them, \"Prayer will not be efficacious in the Land of Israel. Currently, your sins are atoned for so that His name will not be profaned. For this is what I prayed (vv. 27-18): 'Give thought to Your servants, etc. Else the country from which You freed us will say, \"It was because Adonai was powerless to bring them.\"' That is why you were not liable for death on account of it. But after He kills 31 kings and gives their property to you, then He will expel you and exile you from the land, for there will not be any desecration of the name, in saying to the nations that it was because Adonai was powerless.\" Instead, the nations will say that Israel sinned against Him, as is set out in Atem Nitzavim (Deut. 29:23-27): \"All nations will ask, 'Why did the LORD do thus to this land? Wherefore that awful wrath?' etc., They will be told, 'Because they forsook the covenant that the LORD, God of their fathers, etc., The LORD uprooted them from their soil in anger, fury, and great wrath, and cast them into another land, as is still the case.'\""
