                "(1) The sophisticated persons will understand that all the words of our Rabbis and their interpretations are solid and true. And this is what is said in Mas. Shabbat (63a), \"I was 18 years old, and I did not know that Scripture never departs from its straightforward meaning. Essentially, the laws and interpretations derive from superfluities in Scripture or from variations in language, where the plain sense of Scripture is written in language from which one can derive the essence of the interpretation. For example [Gen. 2:4], \"Such is the story of heaven and earth when they were created [b'hibar'am],\" and the Sages expounded \"b'Avraham\" from the lengthening of the expression, since there was no need to write \"b'hibar'am.\" And now I will explain the interpretations of the early scholars on this verse, to make clear to people why I did not see fit to interpret as they did.<br>Some interpret, \"In the beginning [barishonah] God created the heavens and the earth.\" One cannot say this, because the water came first, as it is written (v.2), \"a wind from God sweeping over the water.\" Furthermore, it is not written \"barishonah\" but rather \"b'reishit,\" in the construct state, as in (Gen. 10:10), \"The beginning of [reishit] his kingdom was Babel.\"<br>And the one who interprets it like (Hosea 1:2), \"When Adonai began to speak to Hoshea,\" in other words, \"At the beginning of God's creating of the heavens,\" in other words, when God had not yet created heavens and earth, \"the earth was unformed and void, with darkness over the surface of the deep and a wind from God sweeping over the water,\" the conclusion is that the water was created first. This is also nonsense, as it should not have written \"the earth was unformed and void,\" because, since it had not yet been created, it should not have called it \"earth\" before the formation of the waters, since the waters came first.<br>But this is the essential straightforward meaning, according to the way of Scripture: that it is standard to anticipate and explain a matter which is unnecessary, for the sake of a matter that is mentioned below in another place. As it is written (Gen. 9:18), \"Shem, Ham, and Yafet,\" and it is written (ibid.), \"And Ham was the father of K'na'an.\" But this is because it is written below, \"Cursed be K'na'an,\" and, had it not been explained initially who K'na'an is, we would not know why Noah cursed him. [Similarly,] \"He [R'uven] lay with Bilhah, his father's concubine, and Israel heard about it.\" And nothing is written here to the effect that Ya'akov said anything about R'uven. But since, at the time of his death, he said [about R'uven] (Gen. 49:4), \"Unstable as water, you shall excel no longer; For when you mounted your father’s bed, You brought disgrace—my couch he mounted,\" it says in advance, \"Israel heard about it,\" so that you will not be surprised when you see that he rebukes him for this at the end of his days. And similarly in many places.<br>Also, this whole passage is about the work of the six days of Creation; Moshe our Master puts it in advance to explain to you what the Holy One, blessed be He, said at the time of the Giving of the Torah (Exod. 20:7-10), \"Remember the Shabbat and sanctify it, ... for in six days, Adonai made the heaven and the earth, the sea and all that is in them, and He rested on the seventh day.\" And this is why it is written (Gen. 1:31), \"... and there was morning, the sixth day\" -- that sixth that was the end of the six days that the Holy One, blessed be He, mentioned at the time of the Giving of the Torah. That is why Moshe said this to Israel, to inform them that the word of the Holy One, blessed be He, is true.<br>And lest you imagine that this world had always been constructed as you see it now, full of all good things? It was not thus; rather, \"When God began to create, etc.,\" in other words, in the beginning of the creation of the heavens and the earth, in other words, at the time when the upper heavens and the earth had already been created, whether for a long time or for a short time, then (v.2) \"the earth was etc.\""

And likewise, “And Moshe called Hoshea bin Nun: Yehoshua” (Numbers 13:15) [referring to] what was stated earlier “for the tribe of Ephraim – Hoshea bin Nun” (Numbers 13:8) – he’s the same one whom Moshe called “Yehoshua bin Nun”, whom he appointed previously as servant in his house. For, it is the manner of kings when appointing people over their house to give them new names, as it is stated, “And Par’oh called Yosef’s name <i>Tzafnat Pa’aneach</i>” (Genesis 41:45), [or] “and he called Daniel <i>Belshatzar</i> (Daniel 1:7).",

The text does not come to state that the evening and the morning are part of a single day, for it only needs to explain how there were six days – that the morning broke and the night was finished: behold, one days was completed and another day began."

It is written (Gen. 21:30), \"You are to accept these seven ewes from me.\" The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, \"You gave him seven ewes! By your life, his descendants will wage seven wars against your descendants and will defeat them.\" Another matter: \"By your life, his descendants will kill these seven righteous ones among your descendants: Shimshon, Hofni, Pinhas, Shaul, and his three sons.\" Another matter: \"By your life, his descendants will destroy these seven dwellings: the tent of meeting, Gilgal, Nov, Shiloh, Giv'on, and the Temple, twice.

                "(1) THIS, THEN, IS THE LINE OF YA'AKOV. Intelligent people should discern and understand what our Rabbis taught us, that Scripture never forsakes its plain sense. Even though, essentially, Torah comes to teach us and inform us through hints from the plain sense, narratives, laws, and rules, and through elaborations of the text and the 32 principles of R' Eliezer the son of R' Yosi HaG'lili, and through the 13 principles of R' Yishma'el. And the early Sages, because of their piety, engaged in inclining after the drashot, which are primary, and because of this, they were not familiar with the deep plain sense of Scripture. As the Sages said, \"Do not make your children engage much in Scripture\" [see Ber. 28a and Rashi there]. And they also said (B.M. 33a), \"One who occupies himself with Scripture [alone] is meritorious but not very much so, ... but one who engages in Talmud, there is no greater measure than this.\" And in this way, they were not so familiar with the plain sense of Scriptural passages. And as it says in Mas. Shabbat, \"I was 18 years old and had read the entire Talmud, and I did not know that Scripture never forsakes its plain sense.\" And our Master Shlomo, my maternal grandfather, the enlightener of the Exile, who expounded on Torah, N'vi'im, and K'tuvim, set his mind also on explaining the plain sense of Scripture. However, I, Sh'mu'el the son of R' Meir, his son-in-law, may his sainted name be for a blessing, argued with him and before him, and he acknowledged to me that if he had had more time, he would need to produce other commentaries according to the plain meanings that renew each day. ",
                "And now the intelligent people will see what the early ones explained (2) \"THIS IS THE LINE OF YA'AKOV\" as \"These are the events and the occurrences that happened to Ya'akov.\" And this is nonsense. For every \"eleh tol'dot\" in Torah and K'tuvim is either about the individual's children or, more often, his grandchildren, as I explained in [Parashat] \"Eleh Tol'dot Noah\" (Gen. 6:9). Above that, in Parashat B'reishit, it's written (Fen. 5:32), \"Noah was 500 years old, and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Yafet.\" And after that, it explains that the world sinned, but (Gen. 6:8) \"Noah found favor.\" And after that, it states (Gen. 6:9), \"These are the generations of Noah,\" his children's children -- how he had three sons, and the Holy One, blessed be He, ordered him to bring them into the Ark for 12 months, and upon their exit, \"sons were born to them after the Flood\" (Gen. 10:1), until they increased to 70 descendants, who were the 70 nations, as it is written (Gen. 10:32), \"from these branched out etc.\"And likewise with Esav. The first section (Gen. 36:1-5) specifies Esav's sons who were born to him in his father's location, and after that \"he went to another land\" (v.6) and settled on Mt. Seir (v.9) and all that section. And it is written (v.9), \"This, then, is the line of Esau, the ancestor of the Edomites, in the hill country of Seir.\" And all of this second section is about Esav's children [their descendants].    And as we found with Esav -- that it states that his sons were born in his father's neighborhood, before he \"went to another land because of his brother Jacob\" (Gen. 36:6), and his grandchildren were born at Mt. Seir -- so with Ya'akov: above, it says (Gen. 35:22), \"Now the sons of Jacob were twelve in number. Etc.\" And it states at the end (vv. 26-27), \"These are the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan-aram. And [Jacob] came to his father Isaac, etc.\" Thus it has set out Ya'akov's sons and where they were born, as it id with Esav's sons. And now [in our chapter] it writes (Gen. 37:2), \"This is the line of Ya'akov\": his grandchildren, who were 70, how they were born. How? \"Yosef was 17 years old\"; his brothers envied him; and as a result, \"Yehuda left his brothers\" (Gen. 38:1) and had sons in K'ziv and in Adulam -- Shelah, Peretz, and Zerah; and it ensues that Yosef \"was taken down to Egypt\" (Gen. 39:1), and Menashe and Ephraim were born to him in Egypt, and Yosef sent for his father and his household, until they numbered 70. And Moshe our Master had to write all this, since he rebuked them in connection with this, \"Your ancestors went down to Egypt seventy persons in all\" (Deut. 10:22; see 11:1).",
                "(3) בן שבע עשרה שנה, this was necessary so that we realise that the separation of Joseph from his father –during which time Yaakov had considered his as dead- lasted for 22 years. The Torah testified in 41,26 that Joseph was 30 years old when presented to Pharaoh, after which time 7 good years and 2 years of famine occurred before Yaakov and family descended to settle in Egypt, making a total of 22 years of separation.",
                "(4) TENDED THE FLOCKS WITH HIS BROTHERS. The sons of Leah. Following social norms, it calls [them] his brothers, and not the sons of the concubines.",
                "(5) והוא נער את בני בלהה ואת בני זלפה, he spent most of his time in the company of those four children who were far closer to him in age. The fact that Joseph preferred the company of the sons of the servant-maids may have been the beginning of the sons of Leah resenting him.",
                "(6) ET EHAV. With his brothers. He herded, but, out of youthful joy, he separated from them and was regularly with the concubines' sons rather than with them, like a youth, as it is written (Hos. 11:1), \"Israel was still a child,\" and it is written (II Sam. 2:14), \"Let the young men come forward and sport before us.\" ",

Ed.] The Egyptians’ attitude to people whose vocation was to tend flocks was one of utter disdain, as we know from 46,34. They had contempt for sheep and goats, hence their contempt transferred itself to the people raising such animals. This attitude to sheep and goats is mirrored when Moses asks Pharaoh how he could expect the Israelites to slaughter such animals while in Egypt without running the risk of the local populace stoning them to death for doing this. (Exodus 8,22) Stoning someone to express one’s disgust with his conduct is nothing new; we encounter it in Samuel II 16,5-6 when Shimi ben Geyrah, not only cursed (king) David publicly, but also threw stones at him."
