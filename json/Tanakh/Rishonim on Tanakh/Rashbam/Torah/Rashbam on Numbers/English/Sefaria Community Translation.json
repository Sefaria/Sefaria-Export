Menahem [ben Seruk] explains this [as related to] (Num. 8:26), \"He will serve [sheiret] with his brothers.\"  So the mem [in mishrat] is like the mem of \"mirmas\" (\"a thing trampled\" Isa. 10:6) and of \"mishmar\" (\"custody\" Gen. 40:3), and of (Isa. 17:4) \"the fatness [mishman] of his body become lean.\"  But there cannot be language of \"sherut\" except in connection with work of people for their masters.  So I say that \"mishrat\" is among the words where the third letter of the root is removed, and is from the root shin-reish-heh, as \"miknat kesef\" (Ex. 12:44 \"monetary purchase\") is from the root kof-nun-heh, and its meaning, even though it [the root] does not appear in Scripture, it does appear in the Talmud, \"the Nazir who soaks [shesheirah] his bread in wine.\"  And as for the language of Scripture, we find in Jeremiah (15:11), \"I will spare [sheiriticha] for a better fate.\"  And its meaning is like \"m'sharei kitrin\" (\"solve problems,\" \"untie knots\") in Daniel (5:12) -- in other words, \"I have opened your chains.\"   And it says [the vocalization is] \"sheiriticha,\" like (Ma. 2:3) \"I will strew [v'zeiriti] dung on your faces\" from the root (Num. 17:2) \"cast\" [z'reh].

If so, why did the Holy One, blessed be He, get angry, as it says below (v.10)? So now it explains the reason for the anger, for when they would (v.8) \"grind it between millstones or pound it in a mortar,\" _then_ \"it tasted like rich cream\"; i.e., then its taste would change. For initially it was sweet, \"like wafers in honey\" (Exod. 16:31), like olives and walnuts before being ground, but after grinding, or being crushed in a mortar, then its taste becomes like the moistness of oil or fatty meat, like the taste of olives or walnuts after grinding, when their taste changes. Therefore [misquoting v.10], \"Adonai heard [in verse, \"Moses heard\"] ... and He was angry,\" for whenever they wanted, they would grind it, and it would become like oil, and their food would not be dry. Here it is written (v.8), \"Its taste was,\" for its initial taste changed. But in Parashat B'shalah, it is written (Exod. 16:31), \"Its taste was like wafers in honey,\" for that was its taste before it had the taste of oil.\n"
