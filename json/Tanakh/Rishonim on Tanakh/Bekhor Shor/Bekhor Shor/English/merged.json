As this is the way of thieves, to distance themselves from the the place in which they stole; meaning to say, \"I was not even there.\" But while they were there sitting in the breeze of the day, they heard the 'voice of the Lord marching in the tops of the <i>baca</i> trees.'

He said to them, \"What is my sin above all men that there is no peace in my house?! No [peace] in eating, nor in drinking, nor in lying down, nor in arising - have I killed people, or strangled babies, that this thing should happen to me which never happened to any person?! And now, look, I'm dying at your hands! I can't bear all of this! But the Holy Blessed One will exacted payment for this! For Kayin who sinned, God said God would take revenge seventy times -- all the more so God should take revenge for me seventy-seven!\" And this comes to teach us that man shouldn't have many wives, because that's trouble and strife. And it seems to me that in those days they were far-seeing and wise, and they knew a flood would come in the days of Lemech, for you don't find genealogies for the children of Lemech because they would drown in the flood. The wives of Lemech heard this and wanted to separate from Lemech. They said, \"Why should we birth for vanity, and suffer the pain of pregnancy and birth and child-rearing?\" And he said to them and comforted them, \"Don't believe that the Holy Blessed One would do this, for have I killed a man or strangled youths, that this should happen to me and my children should be drowned? The Holy Blessed One took pity on Kayin - should They not do this all the more so for me?\" And he seduced them with words until he had offspring from them, and it seems to me that this is why these children of Lemech learnt these crafts, since they weren't blessed in agriculture because of the curse of Kayin in their youth, and regarding this matter it was explained by Targum Onkelos."

And it is possible to explain, \"<b>this is what God meant in saying</b>\" as if to say, so thinks God: I will be revenged on these, since they are My close ones, and I will be sanctified and glorified in front of all the people, since they will learn from an <i>a fortiori</i> argument about themselves. Meaning, if God is so revenged on God's close ones when they transgress, how much more so should we fear the same. And when Aharon heard that they were the close ones of God, he was silent and was comforted. And our rabbis have explained that they taught halacha in the presence of their rabbi, or they were drunk on wine, \"<b>and that is what God meant in saying</b>\" when it said, \"I will be sanctified in My honour\" (Exodus 29:43)."

This is similar to the taste of fine oil, which is refined and boiled. In the portion of Beshalach, Pharaoh said, 'It is like honeycomb dipped in honey.' This refers to when it is not cooked. Both cooked and uncooked honey are sweet and require a condiment, as is done with meat using mustard and garlic. Therefore, they asked about onions and garlic. All these things are only the evil inclination, for even regarding these matters, since they do not produce anything for eating or clothing, as it is written, 'Your garments did not wear out on you' (Deuteronomy 29:4). But a light matter, for they had silver, gold, and abundant livestock. Even something that comes down from heaven does not require seasoning, for God does not produce anything that is not perfected. And there is no pleasure in the world like the manna, and the manna descends from heaven.\""

'I request nothing from you but fear and love', for all the commandments are not from you but rather from Him; if He gives you a house, make a <i>mezuzah</i> and a fence [for its flat roof]. Clothing, make fringes. Money, make of it donations. Grain and grape juice and wine, make from them priestly and other tithes. A son, circumcise him. It turns out, performance of the mitzvot is ultimately from God! There is no Arab merchant in the world who, when given 20 dinarim, doesn't give because of this to the One who has commanded regarding it half of the money or a third, and this holds for him goodness. And so too, because of the Holy Blessed One we are able to praise all that You have made and give to him, and not beg at the doors. And this is that he does not ask from us a gift, just fear and love and the intention of the heart, and thus it is written (Job 41:3): \"Who has a previous claim on Me, that I should repay him? All that is under the heavens is Mine!\" -- I am first to give to them, before they give to Me anything. And so said David, \"what is yours has been given to you\". And not only do you do a <i>mitzvah</i>, but you even receive benefit! As it is written \"to your own good\" (Deuteronomy 10:13). And from this verse, our rabbis saw a hint (Menachot 43b) of one hundred daily blessings, as it is written \"What [mah/מה] does the Lord your God ask of you?\" Do not read \"what\" [mah/מה], rather one hundred [me'ah/מאה] -- and there are one hundred letters in this verse from \"And now\", when you read \"what\" with the additional <i>alef</i> (making it \"me'ah\"), that in one hundred there are one hundred letters. For within the verse there are 99 letters, and with the <i>alef</i> there are a round 100. And now there are two [hundreds]! -- one that you read, and a further one of the 100 letters. "

And in Masechet Bikkurim (1:4) they say, Since they cannot say \"to our ancestors\" - and so in prayer, since in prayer our teachers relied on the Talmud Yerushalmi [Bikkurim 1:4 (2:2)] that they bring stories that gerim said in prayer \"God of our ancestors\". This is because \"our ancestors\" [אבותינו <i>avoteinu</i>] is the language of \"our great ones\" [גדולינו <i>gedoleinu</i>], like <b>\"And He has set me as a father to Paroh and as a master to all his house\"</b> (Bereishit 45:8), and so too <b>\"he was the father of all those who play the lyre and the pipe\"</b>  (Bereishit 4:21), which is translated (Targum Onkelos on Bereishit 4:21) \"their teacher\" [רבהון <i>rabhon</i>].
