                "<b>A person (נפש).</b> The Torah uses the term נפש (soul) and not man, and similarly it says (Yechezkel 18:4): The soul that sins, it shall die. This can be compared to two men who committed a crime against the king; one was a stranger and the other a member of the royal court. In judgment, the king pardoned the stranger and sentenced his court member to painful torture. The members of the royal court asked: Why does the king pardon the stranger who committed the same crime? He answered: This stranger knows nothing about my benevolent reign, but the member of my court, who knows my goodness and yet rebels against me, deserves this punishment. So too, the body is a stranger, as it was created from the lower worlds, but the soul is formed from the upper worlds and should be pure, yet it sinned in any case. Thus, the body is laid to rest in the grave but the soul is afflicted with sufferings."

The palm tree upon which the <i>lulav</i> grows has flavor but no scent, and this corresponds to the average Jew who has the flavor of mitzvos but not the scent of Torah. The <i>hadas</i> (myrtle) has scent but no flavor, corresponding to someone who has the scent of Torah but no mitzvos, and the <i>aravah</i> (willow) has no scent or flavor, which corresponds to the people of the land who do not have the scent of Torah or the flavor of mitzvos. We bind the four together, which is a hint that Hashem is not pleased with Israel until they are all united, as it says (Amos 9:6): “Who built His upper stories in Heaven and has founded His unity on earth.” When is Hashem elevated? — At the time that we are all united. Another interpretation is that the <i>lulav</i> resembles the backbone, the <i>hadas</i> resembles the eyes, the <i>aravah</i> the lips, and the <i>esrog</i> the heart. There are no other limbs greater than these and they are equivalent of the entire body. This is what David said (Tehillim 35:10): “All my bones shall say, O Hashem, who is like You?”."
