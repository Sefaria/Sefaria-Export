Therefore, they were the first to be exiled of all the tribes, as it says (Divrei HaYamim I 5:26): “And they exiled the Reuvenites and the Gaddites, and half the tribe of Menashe.” The proper attitude about wealth is taught in the verses (Tehillim 75:7-8): “For it is not from the east or from the west, neither from the desert does elevation come. But Hashem judges; He humbles this one and elevates that one.” This means that the labor a man puts into business, when he travels from east to west, pushing himself become rich, is not what makes him wealthy. His elevation does not come from this. The real source is: “But Hashem judges; He humbles this one and elevates that one.” Hashem takes property from this one and gives it to that one. Why is property called נכסים? Because they are hidden (נכסין) from this one, and revealed to another. Why is money called זוזים? Because they move (זזין) from this one and go to another. Why is money also called ממון? That is to say, why do you count (מונה) it? And why are coins called מעות? Because they distort (מעוותין) justice."
