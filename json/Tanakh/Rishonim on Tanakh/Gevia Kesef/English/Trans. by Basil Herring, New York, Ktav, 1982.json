                "In addition to what has been written in the <i>Menorat Kesef</i> and <i>Mizraḳ Kesef</i>, (one should) know that it is correct to say of God that He is the first cause, in a sense that is compound as well as the (simple) sense of His essence.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">5. Below in n. 14 the sense in which God is “compound” is explained.</i> This is certainly true of the world of Separate Intelligences of which the Lord, may He be blessed, is part.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">6. Kaspi here refers to the existence of universe as three successive worlds, as postulated by the Aristotelian school: the world of Separate Intelligences; the world of Heavenly Spheres below that; the sublunar world of elements. This hierarchy, accepted by Ibn Ezra and Maimonides, is explained by Kaspi in detail in the <i>Menorat Kesef</i> (AS II 79 ff.). In the present passage God is described as being the highest part of the world of Separate Intelligences, and therefore “part” of the universe. Cf. above p. 28, n. 188.</i> The reason is that the world of Separate Intelligences, or if you will, the universe of the Intellect, or the universe of the Intelligences, consists of Him, blessed be He, His court and His attendants, as our Sages said. This category is divided, according to our conception, into three components, when described in terms of cause and effect,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">7. Each Intelligence is the cause of the one Intelligence below it, and it is in this sense only that they can be numbered separately. This way to distinguish them follows Maimonides, <i>Ma’amar Ha-Yiḥud</i>, ed. M. Steinschneider (Berlin, 1846), p. 5.</i> as Abu-Nasr (Al-Farabi) said (when he described them as) “the Primary One, the Secondary Ones, and the Active Intellect.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">8. Al-Farabi, <i>Al-Madinah Al-Fadilah</i> (Beirut, 1959), p. 23, cited in M. Fakhry, <i>A History of Islamic Philosophy</i> (New York: Columbia University Press, 1970), pp. 136 ff., refers to God as “the First.” Here “Primary One” refers to God, “Secondary Ones” refers to the Separate Intelligences as a group (<i>shniyim</i>), with the Active Intellect as the lowest of the Intelligences. Together they constitute the uppermost of the three worlds. On Kaspi’s perception of that world, see A. Altmann, “The Ladder of Ascension,” in <i>Studies in Mysticism and Religion Presented to Gershom Scholem</i> (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1967), p. 23.</i> You should know that it was from this that in ancient times there first emerged a belief in the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Only later was that belief transformed into something else.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">9. This is an oblique reference to Christianity. Later in chapter V Kaspi is more explicit. Kaspi’s point here is that the Christian doctrine of the trinity has Jewish roots, a point that is discussed and approved by H. Wolfson, <i>The Philosophy of the Church Fathers</i> (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1964), pp. 141–167, without any reference to Kaspi.</i> Indeed, the Lord, blessed be He, is the Primary One, and is the Father; the Intelligences<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">10. Literally “the Secondary Ones.”</i> are known as son or sons, as it says “sons of God,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">11. Gen. 6:2.</i> “sons of might,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">12. Ps. 29:1.</i> which is the main meaning of those verses. Certainly God is called “Father” throughout the Torah and the Bible, for He is the primary bestower of life for all. The Active Intellect is referred to as “the Spirit of God,” “the Holy Spirit,” or “the Spirit of the Lord.” All this is evident.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">13. For further discussion of the structure of the uppermost world, see M. Friedlander, <i>Essays on the Writings of Abraham Ibn Ezra</i> (London, 1877), p. 13.</i>",
                "Accordingly, the world of Separate Intelligences is in one respect one, and in another respect many. If you will you may say (the Separate Intelligences) are many and they are one. Alternatively, | the world of Separate Intelligences as a whole is three, and is one. It was in this manner that the convention of the trinity arose. Even the Primary One (God) Himself could be described in this manner, being one unto Himself and also the threefold cause of the Intelligences and the Active Intellect.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">14. In the <i>‘Ammudei Kesef</i> (AM 70), Kaspi attributes this idea that God is the threefold cause of the universe to Al-Batalyawsi’s <i>Book of Intellectual Circles</i>. Such an idea is found in that work, in D. Kaufmann, ed., <i>Die Spuren Al-Batlajusis in der Jüdischen Religionsphilosophie</i> (Berlin, 1880), pp. 37 ff. (according to the pagination at the back). In <i>Menorat Kesef</i> (AS II 83) Kaspi himself explains that God is perceived in a threefold manner, in that not only is He the intellect and the intellectually cognizing subject as well as the intellectually cognized object (cf. <i>Guide</i> I:68), but He is also the efficient, formal and final cause of the universe (see <i>Guide</i> I:69).</i> Accordingly it could also be said of Him that He is one and He is three, even while He is absolutely one, while everything else is many, for they are compounded of and perfected by cause and effect, which is not so with God, for He has no cause. This is according to our Torah. For this reason the Men of the Great Assembly said, “They import holiness to you three times,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">15. This follows the Sephardic version of the <i>kedushah</i> prayer.</i> in referring to the statement of Isaiah, “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts …”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">16. Isa. 6:3. Kimḥi, in his commentary to this verse, gives a more conventional reading, finding reference to the three worlds that praise God. The Aramaic Targum Onkelos understands the reference as to the heavens, the earth, and the infinity of time. Kaspi goes beyond them to understand the reference as being to the threefold aspect of God Himself, or that of the world of Separate Intelligences. For other, similar interpretations of this verse, most notably that of Crescas, see H. Wolfson, <i>Crescas’ Critique of Aristotle</i> (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1929), p. 459, n. 92, where Crescas is interpreted as referring to a kabbalistic system of <i>sefirot</i>.</i> where the threefold repetition refers to the world of Separate Intelligences in general, and the Lord in particular."

                "In the <i>Mizraḳ Kesef</i> I explained the changes that occur (regarding the names of God) in the Account of Creation, where sometimes He is called God, sometimes the Lord God, and sometimes the Lord.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">1. <i>Mizraḳ Kesef</i> is not extant. The question of the divine names in the story of Creation was raised in the nonextant <i>Kesef Sigim</i>, as is clear from <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 15). In the <i>Menorat Kesef</i> (AS II 88–91) Kaspi discusses this subject with reference to the opening chapters of Genesis, and considers his discussion there as complementary to that in <i>Mizraḳ Kesef</i>. From that discussion it appears that <i>’Elokim</i> was used by Moses in the first chapter of Genesis because it was a term universally recognized as referring to the maker of the universe. Of course the pagans thought the reference to be to the world of Heavenly Spheres, and Moses knew that he could not alter that perception immediately. For this reason the following references were to “tetragrammaton <i>’Elokim</i>,” i.e., the uppermost world of Separate Intelligences. Finally, the tetragrammaton alone occurs, intending the Lord Himself. In this way Moses hoped to bring the world to the recognition of the one true God.</i> I will now complete this with respect to changes occurring in the Torah after the order of Creation, beginning with “These are the generations of Noah. Noah was in his generations a man righteous and wholehearted; Noah walked with God.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">2. Gen. 6:9.</i> Notice that, similar to Job,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">3. The <i>Guide</i> III:22 had noted that Job 1:1 describes Job as “wholehearted and upright, feared God and shunned evil” without any reference to Job’s wisdom.</i> it says that Noah was righteous, not that he was wise, for the intent is to refer to the whole narrative including Noah and his generations as far as Abraham. And even though the Lord spoke with him so that he was a prophet (and therefore must have been wise), it is as Maimonides explained—that “prophecy” and “prophet” are equivocal.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">4. <i>Guide</i> II:35, in reference to Moses’ prophecy as compared to that of other prophets.</i> Thus of Noah it is said, “Noah walked with God,” not “… with the Lord” using the ineffable name. This is like “and Enoch walked with God,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">5. Gen. 5:22.</i> which is written of Enoch. The use of the <i>hitpa‘el</i> is known from the study of logic as an action still in progress and incomplete.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">6. This point is discussed somewhat more by Kaspi in <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 302), where the <i>hitpa‘el</i> is described as referring to “an action still in the middle.” There Kaspi refers to the <i>Physics</i> of Aristotle as his source. In the <i>Physics</i>, bk. 3, 201a, Aristotle defines motion as “the fulfillment of what exists potentially, insofar as it exists potentially.” Thus Noah was potentially close to God.</i> It is thus with every usage of the <i>hitpa‘el</i> stem in Hebrew. Reliable evidence for this is “there you shall sell yourselves … for bondmen and bondwomen …,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">7. Deut. 28:68, <i>“Ve-hitmakartem …”</i></i> which must be in the progressive aspect with the transactions uncompleted. Proof of this is provided by “and no man shall buy you.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">8. At the end of the same verse.</i> Noah’s greatest perception was his recognition of the heavenly influences, similar to his contemporaries, who also did not realize that there was an existent beyond the Heavenly Spheres.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">9. Elsewhere Kaspi says that this knowledge of the uppermost world of Separate Intelligences was first revealed by Abraham.</i> For this reason he attributed most matters, and certainly the flood with the action of the wind that caused the waters to subside, as well as the other details of the story, to the causative action of the Heavenly Spheres, | which are what is intended in the name of “God” (<i>’Elokim</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">10. Accordingly, <i>’Elokim</i> is a generic name for the two upper worlds, which are the Separate Intelligences and the Heavenly Spheres, respectively. “The Lord,” as explained earlier, is part of the former.</i> Notice especially that at the outset “God” is mentioned,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">11. In v. 1.</i> then there is a change to the name “Lord” when it is written, “And the Lord said unto Noah: come thou and all thy house into the ark.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">12. Gen. 7:1.</i> This was (written) to inform us, the recipients of the Torah, that the Lord was the first cause (of those events), and that when we cling to Him we are protected from any evils caused by the constellations or the signs of heaven.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">13. These latter terms are translated in accordance with the sense of J. Klatzkin, <i>’Oṣar Ha-Munaḥim Ha-Philosophim</i> (Berlin, 1928), vol. II, p. 136. This doctrine of heavenly influences was developed most notably in Ibn Ezra’s theory of providence, as found in his commentary to Exod. 3:15. See D. Rosin, “Die Religionsphilosophie Abraham Ibn Ezras,” <i>MGWJ</i>, vol. XLII, p. 160.</i> Similarly it says, “Thus did Noah according to all that the Lord commanded him.” It was, however, very important that regarding Noah’s sacrifice to God the Torah not mention the name “God” (to whom Noah sacrificed), but only “Lord,” which is the ineffable and unique name, for the error of contemporary nations was that they sacrificed to the heavenly host. In the Torah Moses intended above all to remove that belief from us, and to have us believe in the world of the Separate Intelligences that exist in addition to the Heavenly Spheres. Moses did the same regarding (his description of) of the sacrifices of Cain and Abel.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">14. Gen. 4:3–4.</i> As for the “dispersed generation,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">15. Gen. 10:35, “for in his days was the earth divided (<i>niflegah ha-’areṣ</i>.)”</i> who believed exclusively in the Heavenly Spheres, it is clearly fitting to refer to Him who intervened with them as “the Lord” in His glory.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">16. Gen. 11:5.</i>"

                "When the writer of the Torah began with the stories of Abraham he wrote, “Now the Lord said to Abram: Get thee out …”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">1. Gen. 12:1.</i> for Abraham was the first one to discover a belief affirming the existence of the world of Separate Intelligences. This opinion caused him to leave his land,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">2. In <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i> (MK I 72) Abraham’s father, Terah, is described as taking the family from Ur on account of the intense hatred that the beliefs of Abraham had engendered in their contemporaries.</i> doing what he did, for which the Lord acted to save him on various occasions.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">3. In the <i>Menorat Kesef</i> (AS II 85) Abraham is reported to have written many books proving the existence of God beyond the world of Heavenly Spheres. These books were later stolen by the Greeks and Arabs; consequently the proofs of God’s existence as found in Aristotle were initially proposed by Abraham. Cf. above p. 25.</i> Consequently in the stories of Abraham, “Lord” is stated repeatedly, except for those few places where there is good reason.",
                "Firstly, in the vision beginning, “And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the Lord appeared unto Abram and said unto him: I am God Almighty …”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">4. Gen. 17:1.</i> Having begun with “Lord” in accordance with the principle I mentioned—that Abraham possessed this important knowledge—the writer of the Torah continues the rest of the vision without mentioning “Lord” again, for the vision refers to material things appealing to the imagination, such as Abraham’s becoming the patriarch for many peoples through Isaac and Ishmael; and also the command to make the sign in his flesh, and that of his descendants. For this reason “God” is used, for being equivocal, it refers to the Heavenly Spheres as well as the imaginative faculty predominating in every prophet, except Moses.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">5. <i>Guide</i> II:36.</i> This is certainly the case when those prophets perceive that which is of a material nature and imagined, as has been explained. The Torah is likewise precise in its use of <i>Shaddai</i> (“Almighty”), which, being an adjective similar to <i>davvai</i>, refers to someone victorious (alone) whenever | large numbers of people would (ordinarily) be necessary, as has been explained.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">6. See below chap. X, n. 3, where this name is discussed.</i> It is the same in the Lord’s words to Jacob, and in those of Isaac to Jacob (when he said), “and God Almighty bless thee and make thee fruitful and multiply thee.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">7. Gen. 28:3.</i> It is likewise in Jacob’s words to Joseph, (when saying) “God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan and said unto me …”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">8. Gen. 48:3.</i>",
                "In this verse “walk before me …” in the context of Abraham, the use of the <i>hitpa‘el</i> stem teaches us that the intended meaning of this commandment is to things of a corporeal nature, belonging to the imaginative faculty. Similarly, the occurrence twice of “God” in the story of the smiting of Sodom,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">9. Gen. 19:29.</i> where there was an overflow of fire and brimstone that was similar to (Noah’s) flood with its overflow of water, teaches us that (the Heavenly Spheres) are the proximate and essential cause of everything. Now “Lord” is used most of the time to teach us that the Lord in His glory is the ultimate cause of all the actions and powers of the Heavenly Spheres. In the story of Abraham with Abimelech, when it is related that God spoke to Abimelech, the name “God” (<i>’Elokim</i>) is used,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">10. Gen. 20:6.</i> for he only believed in the Heavenly Spheres, and his (prophetic) faculty was exclusively an expression of the imaginative faculty. It appears that the latter consideration is mentioned even regarding Abraham himself.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">11. Abraham likewise relied on his imaginative faculty for his prophetic visions, for only Moses’ prophecy excluded the use of that faculty.</i> However, in the recovery of Abimelech it says, “for the Lord had fast closed up all the wombs”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">12. Gen. 20:18.</i> in order to prevent our erring and to ensure our belief that the Lord is the primary cause of all. Similarly, later regarding Abraham there is the precise beginning of “And the Lord remembered Sarah …”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">13. Gen. 21:1.</i> Thus, because of the circumcision (that was to be commanded), it states, “as God had commanded him,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">14. Gen. 21:4.</i> in a usage of the name that is similar to that mentioned in the earlier vision. We can certainly note the precision of “God (<i>’Elokim</i>) hath made laughter for me,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">15. Gen. 21:6.</i> which does not use “the Lord.” (This usage is correct) for it is not correct to attribute laughter or a similar attribute (to the Lord, but rather)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">16. This insertion seems necessary to make sense of the present passage. It is only a tentative suggestion.</i> to the world of Separate Intelligences. There is a similar precision in “And God said unto Abraham, ‘let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad and because of thy bondwoman,’ ”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">17. Gen. 21:12.</i> for such matters of the imagination, including offspring, can only be properly associated with the imaginative faculty,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">18. In commenting on Prov. 17:6, Kaspi says that while there is a command to be fruitful and multiply, it is not one of the more important ones.</i> which is an equivocal term for the name “God.” This is true of material and imagined matters in general, for the imagination is corporeal or material.",
                "The statement regarding Hagar “And God opened her eyes”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">19. Gen. 21:19.</i> —is surely similar to that which was said of Eve.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">20. Gen. 3:7 records that God opened the eyes of Adam and Eve to see beyond corporeal matters, as explained in the <i>Guide</i> I:2.</i> Regarding what is said of Rebecca—“And the Lord said unto her”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">21. Gen. 25:23. According to the preceding point, the tetragrammaton would be misplaced here, for the context is of childbirth and other material matters.</i> —there is no problem, for | it is not always and forever necessary to be precise. Sometimes the Torah is exact, and at other times it is inexact, as Maimonides wrote regarding the fifth cause of contradiction as found in the Torah and Prophets.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">22. Here Kaspi alludes to the <i>Guide</i> : Introduction to the first part, which states that on occasion the Torah does not use the exact terminology, instead leaving such precision to another context in the Torah. This principle of Kaspi’s exegesis is discussed in Chapter 2 above. In MK II 67, however, Kaspi prefers to explain that the tetragrammaton here alludes to the Lord as the most distant mover of all speech.</i> Accordingly, occasionally the Torah will be careful to use “God” on account of His being the immediate cause, while at other times “Lord” appears on account of His being the distant mover of all. Reliable evidence of this usage is “And the Lord said to the children of Israel,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">23. Judg. 10:11.</i> (which conveys the truth that) in any case He is the mediate speaker.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">24. This means that the Lord spoke to them through some intermediate speaker, for it is not conceivable that there was another revelation to the entire nation as there had been at Sinai.</i>",
                "At the binding of Isaac the use of “God” at the outset, in the command to sacrifice his son, was most appropriate, for (that command) was not apposite of the Lord. For this reason, when preventing the act, the Torah states, “the angel of the Lord”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">25. Gen. 22:11. Kaspi discusses this event and the names used, in greater detail below chap. XIV, pp. 230–231.</i> and not “the angel of God.” This is because such prevention becomes obvious when one perceives the existence of the world of Separate Intelligences, and clings to that world.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">26. Kaspi means that one who has knowledge of the world of Separate Intelligences knows that such a sacrifice is an abomination.</i> When the Torah refers to Abraham’s act, it is careful to say, “thou art a God-fearing man, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thy only son …,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">27. Gen. 22:12.</i> for the sacrifice of his son was because he feared God, i.e., the Heavenly Spheres.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">28. Kaspi means that had Abraham sacrificed Isaac, it would have been consistent with the prevalent mentality, which believed exclusively in <i>’Elokim</i>.</i> Such an act was also the result of the imagination, for such was and still is, the custom of the nations in making offerings and sacrifices.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">29. Kaspi’s critical approach to sacrifice is more clearly spelled out in the context of the binding of Isaac below in chap. XIV.</i> Furthermore when interrupted (by the angel, Abraham) said, “ <i>’Adonai yir’eh</i>,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">30. Gen. 22:14, meaning “the Lord seeth,” using the tetragrammaton.</i> as opposed to the previous “God will provide Himself …” spoken during the preparation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">31.

                "When Laban and Bethuel answered Eliezer, saying, “the thing proceedeth from the Lord,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">32. Gen. 24:50.</i> even though they knew only of “God,” (they mentioned “Lord”) because Eliezer the servant of Abraham had attributed everything to the Lord, irr saying, “O Lord, the God of my master Abraham,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">33. Gen. 24:42.</i> as with all his statements. Similarly Abimelech said to Isaac, “We saw plainly that the Lord was with thee,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">34.

In AK I 124 Kaspi refers the reader to the <i>Gevia‘ Kesef</i> in order to understand the subject of the names of God, saying that “whoever possesses the <i>Gevia‘</i> will understand perhaps one-tenth [of that subject].”</i> there are three names exclusively applied to the Lord. This means that they are primary, and not derivative, appellations. Even though some of them are on the pattern used for derivative names, they (themselves) are not derivative. These are the tetragrammaton, i.e., <i>yod he’ vav he’</i> ; the name <i>yod he’</i>, which is one-half of the former; as well as <i>’Ehyeh</i>. This is in accordance with what I have written of this in the <i>Menorat Kesef</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">2. In the <i>Menorat Kesef</i> (AS II 94–95) Kaspi says that God has three names distinguishing Him from every other existent.

What follows in the <i>Gevia‘ Kesef</i> expands considerably upon the discussion in the <i>Menorat Kesef</i>.</i> In brief I will say here that each of these three names is the special name of the Prime Cause, and that not one of these (names) can be associated with the world of Separate Intelligences, and certainly not with what is below them. Even though they are all primary names, what is unique and special about each of them is the following.",

Maimonides (<i>Guide</i> I:61) explains the name as follows: “This name gives a clear, unequivocal indication of His essence,” unlike all the other names of God, which are equivocal and signify actions, the like of which exist as our own actions. This is reflected in Kaspi’s first explanation that <i>perush</i> means “explanation.”</i> This is the precise and special nature of this name—that with respect to its letters it has a meaning, but that with respect to its reading it has no meaning, except in the Temple.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">7. The priestly blessing invoked this name, cf. <i>Num. Rabbah</i> 11:21. It was also invoked on the Day of Atonement ten times by the high priest.

Therefore it is read as if it were written <i>’Adonai ’Elokim</i>. The punctuation of the ineffable name has no meaning, and neither does its pronunciation, yet it does possess meaning according to its letters, for if we were (permitted) to read it at will, its meaning would be “exists” and “causes to exist,” which would (not) be exclusive to Him.",
                "They not only made the ineffable name exclusive to Him, they also made His attributes exclusive, through the use and pronunciation of <i>’Adonai</i>.

In the <i>Guide</i> I:61 there is the following passage: “all other names give their names in an equivocal way … even [<i>’Adonai</i>] is derived from a term signifying lordship … for these words are emphatic and of a general character applicable also to other beings.”</i> the intent of the Men of the Great Assembly is that it be understood without the adjective “my,” but alone, as in <i>’adon</i> (“master”) or <i>Shaddai</i> (“Almighty”), That is why Maimonides was careful to compare (<i>’Adonai</i>) to “Sarai,” the wife of Abram, saying in the <i>Guide</i> I:61 that such endings “are emphatic and of a general character,” for every specific reference to “my” or “ours” gives a particular (connotation excluding other referents). (Nowhere in relation to God) does the Bible state <i>’adoni</i> with a <i>ḥireḳ</i> under the <i>nun</i>, even when David and the prophets exclaimed, “the Lord (<i>’Adonai</i>), the Lord (tetragrammaton) of hosts.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">17.

This also accords with our perception of the world of Intelligences in every respect.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">9. These were explained above in chap.

In the <i>Menorat Kesef</i> (AS II 82–83) he explains the details of this doctrine, where the first intelligence (the <i>mishneh ha-ḳarov</i>) necessarily has two perceptions: of itself and of the Lord. All lower intelligences have three perceptions: of themselves, of the immediately preceding intelligence, and of the Lord.</i> This is not in the sense that the world (of Separate Intelligences) can be divided conceptually into three parts, the Primary One, the Secondary Ones (the Intelligences), and the Active Intellect—but that rather each of the Intelligences, with the exception of the first, has at least three components, in that it consists of its perceptions of the Primary One, as well as of the immediately preceding Intelligence, as well as (its perception) of itself.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">11. This is explained in the <i>Guide</i> I:69.</i> Even the Primary One Himself has a threefold aspect in that He is cause of the assorted Intelligences in three ways: as efficient cause, formal cause, and final cause.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">12.

Isa. 6:3.</i> The exact meaning of “hosts” in this context is the Separate Intelligences, while elsewhere “hosts” refers to the Heavenly Spheres, and all Israel. They are all true.",
                "(The Men of the Great Assembly) arranged certain of our prayers to clarify that the threefold repetition (of “holy”) in Isaiah refers to the world of Separate Intelligences, whether to that entire world or only the highest part.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">14. The term “Separate Intelligences” could accordingly refer to that world as a whole or to its highest component, the Lord Himself. Cf. chap.

The subject is discussed in general in the <i>Menorat Kesef</i> (AS II 80–95) without any reference to these verses or prayers.</i> From my words at the beginning of the work, one can understand the verbal similarity between us and the Christians, in that with regard to the trinity they speak of “Father,” “Son,” and “Spirit,” asserting that they are both three and one, which is similar (to what we say). This is all written in the Torah, (such as) when the Lord is described as a father, most remarkably when it says “(thou didst forget God) that bore thee,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">17. Deut. 32:18.</i> for this of necessity means that He has a child. This is especially so in view of the verse “Ye are the children of the Lord your God.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">18. Deut. 14:1.</i> Furthermore it is written with regard to the Active Intellect: “the spirit of God,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">19.

This is but one of several statements that Kaspi makes indicating his concerns regarding Christological claims and Biblical exegesis. Many of the verses mentioned in the present chapter are included among the stock Christian arguments on these issues related to the trinity, and it is likely that their mention here is connected to such Christian claims. In this regard, see above Chapter 2, pp. 69 ff. for its impact on Kaspi’s exegesis, as well as Chapter 3, pp. 95–96 as to the latter years of Kaspi’s literary activity. It should be noted in the present context that while Kaspi appears here to countenance the idea of common approaches to exegesis, as a rule he is scathingly critical of Christological exegesis and polemics.

                "What is written in this work up to this point, as well as what is written in <i>Mizraḳ Kesef</i> and <i>Menorat Kesef</i>, has resolved the first sixteen questions that we enumerated in <i>Kesef Sigim</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">1. On the interrelationship of these works and of the <i>Gevia‘ Kesef</i>, see above pp. 125–132.</i> Therefore I will now proceed to resolve the others one at a time, by writing my opinion regarding the seventeenth question, which embodies two doubts. Regarding the first,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">2. The question, it appears, was as follows: Noah was commanded to take seven pairs of every species of pure beast, two pairs of each species of impure beast, and seven pairs of each species of fowl of the air—would not a uniform number of one or two pairs have sufficed to preserve each species, as in the case of the impure beasts? If the purpose was for sacrifice when disembarking (Gen. 8:20), why require seven pairs if only one of each kind was sacrificed?</i> it is clear that even though Noah attempted to bring beasts and fowl into the ark to save some seed from each (species) through growth, before the floodwaters came, nonetheless when the rain began and continued for several days, several of the beasts and fowl came in the door on their own<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">3. Gen. 7:8, “Of clean beasts and beasts that are not clean, and of fowls and everything that creepeth upon the ground, there <i>went</i> in two and two unto Noah into the ark …”</i> for shelter and protection from the pouring rain, for the ark door, which was on the side, remained open for four, five, or ten days, (possibly) more. Certainly after the waters had lifted the ark and raised it above ground level, Noah must have forcibly pushed off certain beasts and fowl, for he needed no more than a (certain) number to preserve the species, while he did not have a lot of food in the ark to support and manage them (all). It is not necessary to take the numbers “seven” or “two” literally, for “two” refers to the minimum necessary to maintain the species, i.e., male and female. The number “seven” connotes “many,” (as many) as Noah saw fit (to take), for the Hebrew language does often refer to a multitude with the number “seven.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">4. For the significance and widespread use of the number seven in antiquity, see J. Lewy and H. Lewy, “The Origin of the Week and the Oldest West-Asiatic Calendar,” <i>HUCA</i> XVII (1942), p. 22. Maimonides (<i>Guide</i> II:29) states: “for the Hebrews denote multiplicity by the number seven.” See below chap. XXI, n. 7.</i> The reason that the Lord commanded Noah to take many pure beasts was because man has great need for nourishment, so Noah and his children could eat them in the ark. Furthermore, because (the pure beasts) would be continuously fit for consumption later on, it was necessary that many of them emerge from the ark. In addition, when Noah emerged it says “he took of them for an offering,” but not from the impure beasts.",
                "Regarding the fowl, many were necessary, both pure and impure. As for the pure, (many were necessary) for the same reason as the many pure beasts,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">5. Many fowl were required for consumption.</i> and as for the impure, many were necessary, for undoubtedly sickness and death prevailed among the fowl in the ark—for being accustomed to fly, they would die when confined in the ark, and only a few survive, as we can see for ourselves | when birds are sent from this country by ship across the sea to the king of Ishmael, as a gift.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">6. Kaspi was familiar with the lore of the sea from his own extensive travels. Another example of this is found below chap. IX, p. 191. On the general use of this principle of exegesis by Kaspi, see above pp. 61–63.</i>",
                "Furthermore, because fowl can fly a long distance to concealed places, many of them flew to and entered the ark, whether with or against Noah’s will. This solves the doubt engendered by the question.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">7. Cf. above n. 2.</i>",
                "Regarding the resolution of the second doubt as mentioned there,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">8. From what follows, it appears that the doubt was caused by the verse “The Lord smelled the sweet savor, and the Lord said in His heart, ‘I will not again curse the ground …’” (Gen. 8:20–22). Are not sacrifices in general to be avoided, as reason would dictate, and why was the Lord so affected by the particular sacrifice offered by Noah after he descended from the ark?</i> and the others in <i>Kesef Sigim</i> included in the seventeenth question, what I wrote in the <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">9. In <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 47) Kaspi advocated the superiority of prayer over sacrifice, and even over the building of sanctuaries. Cf. <i>Guide</i> II:32 for a similar statement.</i> and the <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">10. <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i> (MK I 160).</i> suffices to answer it. Nonetheless, writing with great brevity, I can say here that the giver of the Torah wrote Genesis in a manner similar to Job; i.e., he wrote narratives describing passing matters,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">11. He means that the truths of theoretical and practical philosphy are not presented in a discursive analytic style, but rather occur in the lives of individuals and nations as described by the use of anecdote.</i> determined to inform us in Genesis of the righteous and their activities in all their details. This is particularly with regard to the patriarchs and their descendants. This (was done) because most people strive to imitate their forefathers. For this reason Moses in the Torah told us to offer sacrifices, even though in truth they are an abomination. This, however, is something that it is not proper for the masses to know, (for sacrifices) are necessary to maintain a community.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">12. On Kaspi’s attitude to the masses and their understanding of Scripture, see above pp. 12 ff, 118, 130 ff.</i> This is especially (necessary) when the opinion of the masses is that sacrifice is most desired by the Lord. Under no circumstances, however, should (sacrifices be offered) to the Heavenly Spheres, but only to the Lord. The same is true of prayer, for even though it is superior to sacrifice, as Maimonides has hinted,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">13. <i>Guide</i> III:32, “Sacrifice pertains to the second intention, whereas invocation, prayer, and modes of worship come closer to the first intention …”</i> nonetheless when we make assembly halls, a Temple, or synagogues, these, like sacrifices, are not necessary in truth. In the final analysis, however, we must admit that our religion does permit sacrifice when to the Lord, and therefore Moses was correct in writing for us, by way of anecdote, of what occurred in earlier times, those things that demonstrate truth to us individuals, and coarse knowledge to the masses, teaching them how to act in relation to the Lord.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">14. Kaspi means that the masses, upon reading these stories, will conclude that sacrifice is desirable, while select individuals will detect the truth that sacrifice is not desired by God. On Kaspi’s method of “detecting the truth” in such matters, see above Chapter 2.</i> Thus, for (the benefit of singular) individuals, when Adam was in the garden of Eden and the Lord told him of | all the animals that he took, Scripture does not mention that He told Adam to sacrifice them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">15. Gen. 2:19–20.</i> God did not bring them to him for that purpose, but only to see what Adam would name them—i.e., to observe and examine their nature so as to give them a Hebrew name indicating their nature in some way.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">16. Kaspi explains in many places (eg. MK II 296–297; <i>Shulḥan Kesef</i>, fols. 197 ff.) that Hebrew terms reflect the inner nature of the objects they name. For further discussion of this, see above pp. 52 ff.</i> And that is what he did.",
                "In a later passage, in writing of Adam’s three sons, far be it from (the writer of the Torah) to say that the righteous Seth made a sacrifice, as was said of Cain and Abel, the (foolish) enthusiasts.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">17. Gen. 4:3–5. In Hebrew the term is <i>he-ḥasid</i>. Kaspi uses the term pejoratively below on fol. 143a, <i>he-ḥasid shoṭeh</i>.</i> In order to benefit the masses, however, it is written that they (sacrificed) to the Lord, and not to God, as it is written, “He that sacrifices unto God, save unto the Lord only, shall be utterly destroyed.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">18. Exod. 22:19.</i> Later, regarding Noah, who was as righteous as Abel, Job and his friends, the Torah was careful not to write that the Lord commanded Noah to sacrifice to Him, and not to write that he should take many animals into the ark for the purpose of making a sacrifice. Instead (the purpose was) to maintain the species, and Noah made the sacrifices of his own accord, as did Abel and Job.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">19. Job 42:1–10.</i> In any case, Noah’s sacrifice is described as made “to the Lord,” and also (resulting in) “the Lord smelled the sweet savor,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">20. Gen. 8:20–21.</i> for that is what the masses should believe. Proof of this is provided by the words “for a sweet savor unto the Lord.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">21. Lev. 4:31, 17:6; Num. 15:24, 18:17, et al. He means that “a sweet savor unto the Lord” means that those who sacrifice consider it sweet. In addition it is also “unto the Lord.” Here, the Lord smelled what was to Noah a sweet smell.</i> For select individuals, however, the writer of the Torah did not write that the three patriarchs sacrificed to the Lord, but wrote only that they made an altar<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">22. Gen. 13:4, 26:25, 35:7.</i> and a house<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">23. Gen. 33:17.</i> and a pillar.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">24. Gen. 28:18.</i> Generally a structure is erected in commemoration, as is written regarding the Gadites and the Reubenites,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">25. Josh. 22:9–24.</i> and some of the acts of Gideon.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">26. Judg. 6:24.</i> These (structures) remind us that they are to be preferred over making a sacrifice, and the Torah, by omitting to make any mention of sacrifice (by the patriarchs), teaches us that sacrifice is not desirable. Thus neither the patriarchs nor Moses at the altar known as <i>’Adonai-nissi</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">27. Exod. 17:15.</i> offered (sacrifice). When subsequently Moses began to command Israel to make sacrifices, it was commanded to be performed by the young men among them, as it is written, “the young men of the children of Israel.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">28. Exod. 24:5, in Heb. <i>na‘arei benei yisra’el</i>.</i> Onkelos translated this as <i>zeṭuṭi benei yisra’el</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">29. This is not found in our editions of Onkelos, where we have instead <i>buḥrei benei yisra’el</i>. The term <i>zeṭuṭi</i> quoted here is found in both Talmuds. In BT <i>Megillah</i> 9a it is related that the seventy-two sages who translated the Bible at the behest of Ptolemy all substituted the word <i>zeṭuṭi</i> for <i>na‘arei</i>. In JT <i>Ta‘anit</i> 4:2 it is related that three Torahs were discovered (II Chron. 34:15), one of which had substituted <i>zeṭuṭi</i> for <i>na‘arei</i>. Kaspi might have had another version of Onkelos or, more likely, confused Onkelos with the translation mentioned in the Talmud. The Targum Yonatan b. Uziel on Exod. 24:11 has <i>zeṭuṭi</i> in translating <i>’aṣilei</i>. Cf. M. Jastrow, <i>Dictionary</i> (New York, 1967), s.v. <i>za‘ṭuṭi</i>.</i> which connotes “youths” in Hebrew. It is clear, for those who can see, that from the way in which sacrifices are described in the Torah, they were (permitted) only by way of necessity, for the reason mentioned by Maimonides.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">30. See <i>Guide</i> III:32, of which this entire section is a reflection.</i> This is certainly true of the description in Jeremiah of child-sacrifice to Baal and Molech,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">31. Jer. 7:31, 19:5.</i> and all the more true of the fact that the writer of the Torah recorded the binding of Isaac, as I wrote in <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">32. <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i> (MK I 102–103).</i> and <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">33. <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 62).</i> If the Lord grant me length of days, I will gather all (these ideas) in the present work.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">34.

Gen. 10:32–11:9.</i> Just as it is clear what is the benefit gained from the story of the flood in all its details—that, as Maimonides said, by reading the prophetic books we know that God was cognizant of their deeds<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">37. <i>Guide</i> III:50, saying that the flood and Sodom’s fate were recorded to teach us that “there is a God that judges.”</i> (and therefore brought on the flood)—so too, in truth, the entire story (of the divided generation) teaches the same lesson.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">38. We learn that God knows the lives of human beings.</i> How can this be disputed—for we see such things constantly.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">39.

This phrase is found in Averroës’ <i>Epitome of Aristotle’s Logic</i> (Riva di Trento, 1559), p. 52a, “when lightning strikes and an animal dies …”</i> There are many instances of this. It was, however, necessary that the masses understand this story in a manner appropriate to them, i.e., that the world was created in time and <i>ex nihilo</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">47. This alludes to Kaspi’s opinion that Maimonides accepted the Aristotelian doctrine of the Eternity of the universe, so that God’s priority was causal, not temporal. See especially <i>‘Ammudei Kesef</i> (AM 99–101), and Mesch, <i>Studies</i>, pp. 96 ff.</i> Yet (it was not necessary) that they understand it in as crude a manner as they do. Certainly it is not correct for the complete sage to understand (these things) in the same manner as does the absolute fool, and certainly not when it comes to intelligibles, for how can we equate an angel with matter?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">48. In Heb. <i>ḥomer</i>. It is possible that the original reading was <i>ḥamor</i> (i.e., “ass”), with the <i>vav</i> repositioned, providing the smoother “how could an angel be equated with an ass?”</i> Consequently it was necessary to write that the people who left there (in the divided generation) settled (in the land of Shinar), because of the narratives of the Creation, of the flood, and of the ark resting on Mount Ararat,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">49.

Gen. 11:1.</i> does not refer to “earth” as an all-inclusive term<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">53. The MS is unclear at this point. According to this reading, the meaning is that the area where the following events occurred was a limited one, not covering the entire earth, for there were already many different lands and languages. Such a reading would accord with Kaspi’s explanation (in <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i>, MK II 16–17) of “and there was not a man to till the ground” (Gen. 2:5), where he says that in other places there were men to till the ground. See S. Pines, “Histabberut Ha-Teḳumah Me-Ḥadash shel Medinah Yehudit le-fi Yosef Ibn Kaspi u-le-fi Spinoza,” <i>Iyyun</i> XIV (1963), p. 289, n. 2.</i> … in <i>Kesef Sigim</i>."

                "The explanation<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">1. In <i>Ṃasref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 51) Kaspi says that this vision “is explained in the <i>Gevia‘ Kesef</i> …”</i> of Abraham’s first vision, beginning “After these things the word of the Lord came to Abram,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">2. Gen. 15:1.</i> needs to be written, because this vision is subtle and profound. In the first place, I will say that to understand the vision of the Sundering, (one should know that) the purpose of the Torah in writing all the details of this story was to inform us that this (vision actually) took place involving Abraham our forefather and the Lord; and also to inform us what it was that Abraham said to the Lord and what the Lord said to Abraham.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">3. In the <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i> (MK I 77) he explains that there was no speaking, for it occurred in Abraham’s sleep; their dialogue was comparable to a dream, involving a mental exchange between God and Abraham.</i> | Abraham’s actions occurred literally, in a manner similar to what is recorded in the Book of Job.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">4.

This was a doctrine espoused by certain Provençal philosophers who allegorized certain passages and personalities in the Bible, most notably those of Abraham and Sarah. For a greater discussion of this, see above pp. 6 ff. and 37.</i> No matter what, we had patriarchs of old, for we did not spring out of the dust.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">6. The question of the historicity of Job occurs in the Talmud (BT <i>Bava‘ Batra‘</i> 15a), where there is an opinion that Job never existed.

                "Having said this, I will (now) explain this episode accurately. I can affirm that in writing this story, the author of the Torah intended to teach us many important things, (to be learnt from) every statement and every affirmation, as is clear. Thus, in the first place, from the specific statement “in a vision,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">7.

Gen. 15:1.</i> The intention of these words is to material reward in this world, even though the words “shield” and “reward” could be understood as referring to a spiritual (reward), such as in the world to come, (but such a spiritual sense) is unlikely according to the Hebrew usage.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">11. Among the commentaries, Nachmanides and Gersonides explained the reference as to this world; Kimḥi and Seforno interpret the reward as applied to the next world. In the <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i> (MK I 78) Kaspi explains that promises of reward in the next world are not in need of prophetic confirmation—they can be adduced through intellectual means. Consequently, the present confirmation would refer to the world of the senses.</i> Proof is from the preceding “Fear not, Abram,” for “fear” (<i>yir’ah</i>) in its Hebrew usage can only be used in the context of this-worldly fear, of whatever kind it might be, or else the absence of what is good. Further proof of this is that evidently Abraham took it in the same way, (from his words) “what wilt thou give me since I go hence childless.” God even explained the reward to him: “he that comes forth out of thy own bowels shall be thine heir.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">12. V. 4.</i> The complete statement, from “thy reward shall be exceeding great” until “so shall thy seed be,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">13.

On the role of Scriptural redundancies and Kaspi’s doctrine that “the Torah speaks in the language of men,” see above pp. 59 ff.</i>",
                "Now a prophet, or anyone else, should not pray to the Lord to renew His favor, nor should he request reassurance of the Lord’s earlier words. Accordingly, when the Lord had said to Abraham, “thy reward shall be exceeding great,” Abraham requested an explanation of the words | “reward” and “great.” God then explained these terms to him at length, as well as the phrase “I am thy shield,” which was added to them. This is similar to “Hast thou not made a hedge about him, and about his house and about all that he has on every side.?”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">15. Job 1:10, meaning that God would protect Abraham, as He did for Job.</i> Now Abraham says two things: firstly, regarding the Lord’s closing statement with which He had left Abraham, and which being so important was therefore concise,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">16. Later in the <i>Gevia‘ Kesef</i>, fol. 152a, Kaspi states that the importance and profundity of Scriptural description, vary inversely with the length of any given passage, so that the shorter the description, the more important it is.</i> Abraham says, “What wilt thou give me?” This is in reference to any future rewards that might be bestowed. (Secondly), regarding the Lord’s opening words, “I am thy shield,” which is in reference to what is already in Abraham’s possession, Abraham says, “That which you protect can only benefit Eliezer, who, because I have no son, is necessarily my (only) inheritor.” Subsequently, having stated the Lord’s words and their explanation, the giver of the Torah records that Abraham believed in the Lord, “and He counted it to him for righteousness.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">17. V. 6.</i>",
                "Then the giver of the Torah wrote that the Lord, in speaking with Abraham again, promised that he would inherit this land, the land of Canaan. While this had already been promised, (it is repeated here) for the promise to Abraham was to be repeated twice. (This happened) the first time in “unto thy seed will I give this land,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">18. Gen. 12:17.</i> and the second time in “to thee will I give it and to thy seed forever.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">19. Gen. 13:15. Both these verses state that the land will be given to Abraham (“thee”), but in fact the land was possessed only by his descendants. Kaspi now explains the answer.</i> This teaches us of three modes of expression, for on occasion Hebrew will refer to “a man” and intend his seed. This is because it is correct to associate a father with what will happen to his seed, and vice versa. This is something precious in the prophetic books,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">20. In <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 39) he says, “one of the secrets of the Torah is that it usually associates the father with what is intended for the son, and vice versa.”</i> (such as) in the words of the Lord to Elijah<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">21. I Kings 21:29, where Elijah foretells the fall of Ahab, only to defer the decree till the period of Ahab’s descendants. This is consistent with Kaspi’s position that no divine decree can be rescinded, it can only be understood in a new light. See <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 286 ff.).</i> when Ahab’s fate was foretold (by God). Remember this.",
                "In this context the giver of the Torah taught us another precious lesson. This is (occasioned by the fact) that even the initial promise, that which promised the bestowal (of children),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">22. The word <i>zera‘</i> is found in the margin of the MS.</i> had already been promised several times by the Lord. It had been written first as “unto thy seed will I give all this land,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">23. Gen. 12:7.</i> and more specifically the second time in “I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth, so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered. Arise walk through the land …”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">24 Gen. 13:16–17.</i> Accordingly, these promises having already been made, (God’s) words here are superfluous and repetitious. Abraham’s words present other problems, for in regard to the promise of the land, the Torah says, “And he believed in the Lord,” yet on the two previous occasions this is not stated. Did he not | believe until the third time?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">25. The question is raised by other exegetes. Nachmanides had answered by quoting Jer. 18:9–10, where the prophetic decree of blessing is changed to punishment. It is interesting that Kaspi quotes these very vv. in <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 287) to prove his point against Maimonides’ insistence that only decrees of punishment are subject to change, yet here Kaspi does not explain Abraham’s behavior as motivated by a fear that he might have misunderstood God’s initial promise.</i> (This is even more questionable) for he did already have faith, proof being that after each vision it states, “And he builded there an altar unto the Lord.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">26. Gen. 12:7, 13:18.</i> (The answer to all these questions) is that this is all to teach us that it is proper for a king to make promises to his servants many times in various ways, on some occasions the servant will remain silent, while at other times he will answer and question. This is certainly the case when the king’s words incorporate words and names that are equivocal.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">27. In <i>’Adnei Kesef</i> (AK II 51) he says, “words and decrees are given by God to the prophet, and sometimes they are not understood at all, or understood only in part …”</i> In this instance “seed” and “son” are equivocal terms, for one can correctly refer thereby either to a blood-relative or to one who is merely nurtured by (an adoptive) father, as is the case with “and was unto him as a daughter.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">28. II Sam. 12:3. In the MS <i>le-vat</i> instead of <i>ke-vat</i>. Kimḥi makes a similar point when he says that “seed” could refer to one of the members of his family, as in the verse “speaking peace to all his seed” (Esther 10:3).</i> Because all this is imaginable, and is similar to what is mentioned in the <i>Metaphysics</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">29. The passage in question occurs in the <i>Metaphysics</i> V, 15, fol. 1021a: “For it is in this way that the father is called the father of his son; for the one has acted and the other has been acted upon in a certain way.” See above nn. 20–21.</i> Abraham therefore inquired on this third occasion if (God’s) words intended the (servant) living in his house. God then explained to him that “he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels (shall be thine heir).” Thus, God’s words having been reiterated several times, Abraham trusted and believed even more.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">30. Kimḥi explained what these several times were: first God said, “Out of thine own bowels”; then he is taken outside to see the stars as a sign that this will come true; finally God mentions His own name as if to swear by it.</i>",
                "Because (the promise of seed) was destined to be fulfilled in his own lifetime, and was not fraught with dangers, Abraham did not request a sign as he had done regarding the promise of entry into the land, which was in the distant future and accompanied by pronounced danger.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">31. Gersonides gives as the reason for this request: “for he did not know if his descendants would merit the necessary divine providence.” Here once again (cf. above n. 25) Kaspi chooses not to press this point against Maimonides.</i> Furthermore (he did not continue to ask for signs) for the longer a sage and a prophet continue to have recourse to the intellect, they become more and more casuistic. Here, (further) request for signs would have been casuistic, shrewd, and devious, even had that request been for a proof that was speculative or prophetic."

In his commentary to the Book of Job (AS I 137), Kaspi takes issue with Maimonides (<i>Guide</i> III:22–23) for leaving the question of Job’s existence unresolved. Kaspi insists on the literal comprehension of “There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job” (Job 1:1), for “if we doubt the existence of Job … we could doubt the existence of all the personalities in the Bible … and if some of our ancestors did not know his time and place, that is not important, for I believe that he existed as recorded …”</i> similar to what is said of the earliest philosophers.

On the importance that Kaspi attaches to the various divisions of the Scriptures, see above Chapter 2.</i> The book (of Genesis), containing in its entirety all that transpired before the birth of Moses, is the most important book in the Torah. This fact (of it having taken place prior to the birth of Moses) constitutes one of the special aspects of Genesis, for the Book of Exodus, and the following books, were easy (for Moses) to write, having seen everything with his own eyes. It was difficult, however, (to write) of what had occurred thousands of years earlier. Nevertheless, for Moses it was “but a small thing,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">8.

Kaspi insists that all of the Torah is from heaven, including all of Deuteronomy, “as those of us who philosophize know” (MK I 110). The final verses of Deuteronomy were likewise included, for “those things that relate to future events are no different from (future predictions in) the rest of the Torah” (MK II 310).</i> This is especially true of those stories in Genesis referring to the past, for they are all categorical, i.e., anecdotal,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">10.

Only the former affirms some truth, for a command does not state any facts. He discusses this further in the <i>Ṣeror Ha-Kesef</i> (fol. 231b). Kaspi’s position here is similar to that of Alfarabi in <i>Five Chapters of Logic</i> (MS Vatican 49, fol. 106a), stating: “the philosophical narrative is that which is called demonstrative, and its purpose is to teach the truth and to cause to understand …” This is quoted in Mesch, <i>Studies</i>, p. 86.

Instead we will give a reason in general …” Kaspi moulded his commentaries on Scriptural use of parable, sometimes explaining at length, at other times in brief.</i>",
                "Accordingly, as Maimonides said,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">29. Introduction to the <i>Guide</i>.</i> it is not always necessary that all the details of a parable | and its interpretation be identical. Here (in the vision of the Sundering) the parable includes everything from the term “heifer” until the words “and Abram drove them away.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">30. V. 11.</i> The interpretation extends from “thy seed shall be a stranger” until “is not yet full.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">31. Vv. 13–16.</i> Accordingly, while the solution covers four verses, it is found in only two verses: i.e., “Know of a surety” and “In the fourth generation.” It excludes “for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full,” for these two other verses do not explain what is in the parable, but rather they provide new information that together with the others relates to what was intended for Abraham. Now the Lord, (like) a teacher, was careful to conceal in the middle that which was not part of the main explanation of the parable, as is proper for one who wishes to conceal and hide,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">32. The MS here has <i>le-ha’amin</i>, meaning “to foster trust,” a rather unusual form of the verb in the present context. More appropriate would be a reading <i>le-haṭmin</i>, lit. “to hide.”</i> as I have explained in regard to Jacob’s words “as long as men come to Shiloh.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">33. Gen. 49:10. This refers to a passage in the <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 105) where he rebuts the Christological interpretation that claims that the word <i>shiloh</i> is a reference to Jesus. At one point there he states that these four letters (<i>shiloh</i>) “are hidden and intermingled, so that no one should notice them unless he has very keen sight …”; i.e., the term is included to confuse and mislead, so as to hide the true meaning of the verse. <br>Leo Strauss, in an essay on the methods that Maimonides utilized in the <i>Guide</i> to conceal and reveal the truth, enumerates this very same point as a primary vehicle for such a literary feat. See L. Strauss, “The Literary Character of the <i>Guide for the Perplexed,” Persecution and the Art of Writing</i> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1952), p. 52.</i> Likewise there are other words in the parable that are not an integral part of the intended promise, including “and he laid each half over against the other,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">34. V. 10.</i> as I will explain later. It appears from all of this that the Lord wanted to reveal to Abraham that some of his seed would be slaves in a strange land not owned by them, but He did not want to reveal to him which land (that would be), except to tell him that the fourth generation would escape from that servitude. This is what occurred in Egypt, as it is written, “And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation,” and then, “Now there arose a new king over Egypt,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">35. Exod. 1:6.</i> which began the enslavement of the tribes. Included were the generations of Kohath, Amram, and Moses.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">36. Rashi refers to the four generations as Judah, Pereẓ, Ḥeẓron, and Caleb. Nachmanides understands the reference to be to four generations of Amorites. Kaspi here follows Kimḥi’s listing of the generations. For further discussion of this, see C. Gordon, “Hebrew Origins in the Light of Recent Discovery,” in <i>Biblical and Other Studies</i>, ed. A. Altmann (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1963), p. 4.</i> Thus, the words “thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them” accord with the manner of every wise teacher, and are certainly appropriate words for the great teacher who is the Lord.",
                "“Thy seed shall be a stranger” refers to Egypt, saying that his seed would serve and be afflicted by the Egyptians.",
                "“Four hundred years” has no allusion in the parable, but it was considered correct by the teacher to reveal the complete explanation and intended meaning at that point. This figure is related to “thy seed shall be a stranger,” but the phrase “and they shall serve them and they shall afflict them” is not necessarily part of the figure (of four hundred years). In a sense it would be correct | to say that they were afflicted for (four hundred years) during all that time, for it is the lot of every stranger (to be afflicted).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">37. This is an attempt by Kaspi to answer the problem of the actual duration of the stay in Egypt, which would appear to have lasted less than the four hundred years foretold in Gen. 15:13. Gersonides considered the four-hundred-year period to have begun with Jacob’s birth; Kaspi follows Rashi, who computes the period from the birth of Isaac, and follows Kimḥi, who had stated that “affliction” could also refer to a condition of alienation, such as that which Isaac and Jacob experienced.</i> Reliable evidence of this (affliction) is provided by the (names) of the wells dug by Isaac, called <i>‘Eseḳ</i> (“contention”) and <i>Siṭnah</i> (“enmity”),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">38. Gen. 26:20–21. Both names reflect the alienation of Isaac.</i> as well as the incident of (the rape of) Dinah in Jacob’s lifetime.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">39. Gen. 34. This reflected the abuse and alienation of Jacob.</i> In any case, Isaac and Jacob were aliens, downtrodden and subservient for a time in Egypt,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">40. Actually Isaac never lived in Egypt. One explanation might be that Kaspi alludes to Isaac’s sojourn in the land of the Philistines, to the south of the land of Canaan, in Gen. 26.</i> a fact which justifies the figure of four hundred years, and removes any inconsistency. However, part of (the four hundred years) was more intense and literal as far as the words “serve” and “afflict.” (This is consistent) with what I mentioned above, saying that descriptive words can be used in an exact literal sense, and also in a loose sense.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">41. See below.</i> The Lord revealed to Abraham that the words “thy seed shall be a stranger” referred to three generations, when He stated afterwards “the fourth generation …” That fourth generation was the one that entered the land in the time of Joshua, the generation that was led about in the desert having been the third generation that endured in part the suffering in Egypt, starting on the day that Moses was born and continuing until the time of the burning bush, when he was eighty years old.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">42. Exod. 3:2. Kaspi computes this age by the fact that at his death Moses was 120 years old, which was after 40 years in the desert; therefore Moses was 80 when he appeared at Mount Sinai the first time.</i> (In this matter) it is not necessary to detail the components and the people involved.",
                "The explanation of the parable (of the Sundering) is that the three animals that are mentioned<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">43. In Heb. <i>shilush</i>, lit. “triplicate.”</i> are a metaphor for the three generations discussed above, while the turtle-dove and the young pigeon refer to the fourth generation. The Lord commanded him to sunder the three species so that their blood could be offered to the Lord. The words “all these” (“he took him …”) refers only to the livestock, in that later it is written, “but the birds divided he not.” The word “all” poses no problem (by implying that Abraham took everything) to one who knows the holy language.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">44. In the <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 162) Kaspi says, “the word <i>kol</i> [all] in Hebrew and its equivalent in Provençal are used when referring to the major portion of anything, just as long as a large number is involved …”</i> All of this refers to the beating and pursuing of the Israelites that took place during those three generations,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">45. In the <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i> (MK I 81) they are described as “tortured and dissipated.”</i> which resulted in their being considered corpses.

That is why death too is by a figure of speech called the end, because both are last things.”</i> and certainly in view of what is written in the <i>Posterior Analytics</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">47. The meaning of likeness is not discussed in the <i>Posterior Analytics</i>, but in the <i>Metaphysics</i> X, 3, 1054b, the following is found: “things are alike, if, not being absolutely the same, nor without difference in respect of their concrete substance, they are the same in form … other things are alike, if having the form, and being things in which difference of degree is possible, they have no difference of degree.”</i> and the <i>De Caelo</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">48.

But the problem with this is that if so, the words included in the brackets remain unexplained.

                "The Lord, as a teacher would do, described three species of animal to Abraham—a heifer, a she-goat, and a ram. These were, as noted earlier, a parable and metaphor for the three generations of Jews who were strangers and servants. The number is appropriate: three species that correspond to three generations. The number “three” is a properly equivocal term, for the intent is to one she- goat, one heifer, and one ram, a sum of three, with each one constituting a third, no matter which one is placed first, which one second, and which one third.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">55. I have not found a precedent for this explanation. Rashi, Nachmanides, and Kimḥi all explain that there were three animals of each type. Nachmanides, however, is aware that according to that explanation, the term <i>sheloshah</i> would have been preferable to the uncommon <i>meshulash</i>. Ibn Ezra and Gersonides explain that the animals were to be three years old. Kaspi elsewhere (MK I 80, MK II 52) is unclear but it would appear that there he follows Rashi. Here, however, he makes it clear that there was one animal of each type, so that each was one-third of the total.</i> Now (the Lord) as the teacher, mentioned these three animals three times, to emphasize and reinforce that this was indeed coming from God.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">56.

                "I can now explain the meaning of the words <i>‘eglah</i> (“heifer”), <i>‘ez</i> (“she-goat”), and <i>’ayil</i> (“ram”) in accordance with their precise significance.

                "The expression “to make a covenant,” as well as any expression of an oath (by the Lord), occurs in the sense of “the Torah speaks in the language of men.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">105</sup><i class=\"footnote\">105. BT <i>Bava’ Meṣi‘a’</i> 31b, BT <i>Yevamot</i> 71a. See above Chapter 2.</i> It merely conveys the idea of something permanent and necessary. Now even though (the subject of the covenant) referred to a future event, (the likelihood of its coming to be) was of the order of tomorrow’s sunrise (i.e., a certainty), and not of the order of rainfall on the morrow (which would be contingent).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">106</sup><i class=\"footnote\">106. The distinction between conclusions that are necessary and those that are contingent is an important part of the study of logic, at the basis of the laws of the syllogism. For further discussion of this aspect of Kaspi’s exegesis, see above pp. 44–46.</i> This promise of the land that was made to Abraham was more secure and well bound than any of the earlier promises made to him in this regard, for it was by way of a covenant.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">107</sup><i class=\"footnote\">107. Here Kaspi attempts to show that what appears to be mere repetition of an earlier promise, and therefore a redundancy, is in fact quite necessary. The question of Scriptural redundancy is discussed again on fol. 152 ff.</i> (This is shown) in truth by the fact that when Abraham asked of the Lord, “Whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?”, which the wise know was because one can only rely on that which is proved, the Lord’s answer was essentially to establish a covenant. The reason for this was that future events from the Lord of a prophetic nature (are proven by a covenant), just as things that exist at present are proven by a wise teacher who adduces conclusion from necessary and independent premises. It is known that the Lord interchanges modes, i.e., the prophetic modes and those of the rational sciences. Consequently Abraham inquired correctly when he said, “Whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?” and the Lord answered him correctly. This was similar to if Averroës had asked Aristotle, “How shall I know that every man is sentient?” to which the reply would have been, “Know that every man is an animal, and every animal is sentient.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">108</sup><i class=\"footnote\">108. This is the type of syllogism of a categorical nature that is analyzed by Aristotle in the <i>Prior Analytics</i> I, 4, 25b. The same syllogism is found in <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 154). On the use of this principle in Kaspi’s exegesis, see above pp. 44–46.</i> This was how Abraham, in an imprecise manner, inquired of the Lord, in accordance with the dimension of the prophetic mode, which is appropriate for future events. The Lord answered him with the appropriate means by making a necessary proof consisting of a covenant that verified that the future decree was necessary, not contingent. The Lord, however, preceded that proof by stating, “Take me a heifer …” and that entire passage, by way of introducing the desired statement, (to answer) the request to know that the matter was as necessary as tomorrow’s sunrise.",
                "Accordingly, Abraham’s words “whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it” were as if he had said, “Lord God, | on several occasions you have promised me that ‘this land will I give unto you,’ but I do not know if this future decree is necessary or contingent, and therefore I am in doubt and afraid.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">109</sup><i class=\"footnote\">109. Elsewhere (MK II 289, AK II 51) Kaspi explains that a prophet might be uncertain of the meaning of a divine statement, for a prophet has only the word-characters (<i>mahut ha-millot</i>) to go by. Here God’s words do not indicate whether the promise is necessary or contingent, so Abraham is unsure.</i> Explain this to me.” The Lord then fulfilled Abraham’s desire through the making of the covenant, which informed Abraham that (the promise) was a necessary one. It was for this reason that Abraham said “how shall I know” and did not say “how shall I believe” or “how shall I think” or “how is it possible,” as had been said earlier in regard to the two earlier promises, i.e., the promise of seed, and that of———.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">110</sup><i class=\"footnote\">110. Here the MS is unclear, with the word <i>devaro</i> inserted.</i> In this regard, Maimonides explained <i>’emunah</i> (“faith”) and <i>ha’amanah</i> (“the act of believing”) in the <i>Guide</i> I:50. In the <i>Posterior Analytics</i> it has been explained that what is not known by means of a necessary proof is considered a “justifiable conception,” or a thought that is right and just.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">111</sup><i class=\"footnote\">111. In the <i>Posterior Analytics</i> I, 33, 88b, Aristotle says: “opinion may be concerned with that which is true or false, and can be otherwise: opinion is in fact the grasp of a premise which is immediate but not necessary … (on the other hand scientific knowledge) is universal, and proceeds by necessary connections, and that which is necessary cannot be otherwise.”</i> It is similar with the mode of prophecy, for that which is not known with certainty, as the knowledge of the future rising of the sun, is described in these terms (i.e., “belief”). Therefore earlier it states, “And He counted it to him for righteousness” (i.e., Abraham’s acceptance of the promise of seed), for God had not informed Abraham that it was a necessary promise, and Abraham did not ask for such (assurance) except in this case (of the land), for whatever reason. It was only after Abraham did well in the binding of Isaac that the Lord, of His own accord, provided Abraham the necessary knowledge, i.e., the (necessary) great multiplication of his seed, in the words “by myself have I sworn.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">112</sup><i class=\"footnote\">112. Gen. 22:16.</i> Had the Lord made (such) a covenant with Jacob, or sworn on the words “I will surely do thee good and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">113</sup><i class=\"footnote\">113. Gen. 32:13.</i> then Jacob would not have feared on account of Esau.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">114</sup><i class=\"footnote\">114. Gen. 32:8.</i> (His fear) was not because Jacob was foolish, he merely followed Abraham’s thinking (in not asking for such a covenant regarding seed), for Abraham did not ask “how shall I know …” in relation to the promise of his personal benefits, or of the multiplication of his seed. Those things were close in time to being fulfilled, as well as close in reality, for they were naturally probable. (This is) enough on this subject.",
                "In the <i>Kesef Sigim</i> I asked what was the sin of Israel for which God decreed such troubles on them, | and I also said that in any case the writer of the Torah should not have mentioned their sufferings without (also mentioning) their sins.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">115</sup><i class=\"footnote\">115. Apparently the question was one of theodicy: How could this affliction in a strange land be deserved, if those people were not yet born?</i> For such (undeserved punishment) is considered evil and distasteful by the masses, and even by those few people (close to) the Lord. The answer is that the Lord did not intend this (decree) by way of suffering and punishment, neither did He intend to burden Abraham’s heart, for His intention throughout this vision was to impart good news to him. If one would ask, how can “and they shall serve them and they shall afflict them” be good news, the answer is to be found by asking, how could God’s promise to Manoah’s wife, stating “behold now, thou art barren … but thou shalt conceive and bear a son,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">116</sup><i class=\"footnote\">116. Judg. 13:3.</i> be good news? After all (giving birth) involves the problems of suffering, pain, and fear, in accordance with the characterization of giving birth as “in pain thou shall bring forth children,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">117</sup><i class=\"footnote\">117. Gen. 4:16.</i> i.e., conception and giving birth are compared to suffering. It is similar in the precise statement “as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">118</sup><i class=\"footnote\">118. Isa. 66:8.</i> where the term <i>ḥalah</i> is not related to <i>ḥayil</i> (“strength”). (In the case of Abraham) the tidings of a child and children are mentioned in a precise way in that they only mention the existence of the child (and not the suffering that precedes), when it says, “I will bless her and moreover I will give thee a son of her,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">119</sup><i class=\"footnote\">119. Gen. 17:6.</i> and elsewhere, “I will certainly return unto thee when the season cometh around, and lo, thy wife shall have a son.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">120</sup><i class=\"footnote\">120.

At this point the MS has two words <i>sekhel veṭov</i> (“intelligent and good”) whose reference is unclear, for they could refer to God, to Sarah, or the child.</i> Yet it was impossible to achieve such a benefit without its preceding pains and suffering.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">122</sup><i class=\"footnote\">122. At one point in Kaspi’s comments on Job (AS I 146), he says that the three friends of Job share the opinion that every righteous man properly experiences hardship, so that ultimately his happiness is increased.</i>",
                "Reliable evidence for this is provided by those going to sea in ships who risk and endanger their lives in order to profit thousands of gold pieces when they reach their destination, and then they thank God for His mercies, as David has written.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">123</sup><i class=\"footnote\">123. Ps. 18:17–18, which repeats David’s praise in II Sam. 22:17: <br>He sent from on high, He took me; <br>He drew me out of many waters. <br>He delivered me from my enemy most strong.</i> Should they, on account of the dangers, avoid traveling on the sea or not rejoice at the profits? It is similar with the merchants traveling in the desert, and (the soldiers) who conquer cities in war, and in so doing suffer many things, including death. Why should I need to mention these examples, when the achievement of all benefits in the world is just like this. Even women and children know that a man achieves nothing by merely lying with his wife.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">124</sup><i class=\"footnote\">124. In <i>Ḥaṣoṣrot Kesef</i> (As I 59) Kaspi similarly rebukes the masses, who “think that intercourse is in itself good and proper, and who like cockerels are constantly with their wives.” On the other hand, however, in <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 256) Kaspi says: “they have said, ‘the greater the man the greater his evil inclination’ [BT <i>Succah</i> 52a]; consequently Moses’ natural functions did not weaken even when he was eighty years old … so one should not think that Moses withdrew from women, for he was no Augustinian or Carmelite (monk).”</i>",
                "Now this is especially true here (in the case of Abraham’s descendants in Egypt), when those problems mentioned, i.e., the servitude and affliction, are themselves the cause of “and afterwards they shall come out with great substance,” and “in the fourth generation they shall come back hither.” This is true for several reasons: Firstly, were it not | for (these problems), there would not have occurred “the children of Israel sighed … and their cry came up to God,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">125</sup><i class=\"footnote\">125. Exod. 2:23.</i> which was the essential reason that the Lord took them from Egypt. This is also true of “I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and I have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">126</sup><i class=\"footnote\">126. Exod. 3:7.</i> Had the children of Israel lived in Egypt in peace, and had none of this (affliction) existed, they would not have inherited the land of Canaan or built the Temple.

This paraphrases the <i>Guide</i> III:27, which states: “the law as a whole aims at two things: the welfare of the soul and the welfare of the body.” Kaspi expands upon this in <i>Sefer Ha-Musar</i> (AS II 61, <i>Ethical Wills</i> p. 133).</i> This is to be compared to those at sea en route to their destination, who are led to another destination against their will by a storm brought by the Lord, only to profit many times more (than originally planned), or to profit instead of losing their lives and money had they reached their intended destination. This is a constant occurrence on land and sea. The same is true of our people (in Egypt) in their success (in improving their body and soul). The enslavement of Joseph after he was sold and imprisoned and tied (hand) and foot was similar. The whole matter is to be compared to a sick man who is fed “sangvin”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">131</sup><i class=\"footnote\">131. In the Parma MS of <i>Ḳevuṣat Kesef</i>, Kaspi refers to this potion as a medicine compounded of honey and vinegar. References to this medicine are found in Averroës’ <i>Epitome of Aristotle’s Physics</i> (Riva di Trento, 1559) and Maimonides’ <i>Be’ur Ha-Shemot Ha-Refu’ot</i>, ed. S. Muntner (Jerusalem: Mosad Harav Kook, 1969), p. 114, where in a responsum it is advocated to take a solution of vinegar and honey, about an hour after a meal, to assist the digestive process. The editor translates the term as “oxymel.”</i> (which is a bitter potion) causing him to recuperate and stay alive, only to die later when he is fed honey.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">132</sup><i class=\"footnote\">132. The point here is that the bitter vinegar is an active agent that effects the recovery.</i> The sages compare this to one whose organ was severed in wartime by an enemy, resulting in a loss of blood that saved his life, for (all along) he had been in need of bloodletting to prevent his death.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">133</sup><i class=\"footnote\">133. Bloodletting is discussed in BT <i>Shabbat</i> 129a.

The idea of suffering as a discipline and as a didactic tool has a long history in Biblical thought. The “suffering servant of the Lord” is first found in Isaiah, and also is found in the Book of Job, in the speeches of Eliphaz and Elihu (Job 5:17, 33:16–30, 36:9–12).

V. 18.</i> Such words are not appropriate for a man such as Abraham, for by uttering them he attributed deception or exaggeration to God. God had told him that Sarah would give birth, and this answer—“Oh that Ishmael might live before thee”—was as if he said, “(You must be referring to) this son, for otherwise this is impossible and cannot happen.” The answer to all this is that this entire passage displays remarkable wisdom, and can be attested to by those knowing logic. Abraham said to the Lord, “Regarding what you mentioned earlier in the vision—i.e., ‘I will make thee exceeding fruitful … and I will establish my covenant … and I will give unto thy seed the land of thy sojournings …’—clearly these things are as necessary as tomorrow’s sunrise, for all of this explains the earlier vision of the Sundering, which spoke of the covenant. This, however, could all apply equally to Ishmael, who is already born.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">27. In <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i> (MK I 89) Kaspi explains otherwise, saying that Abraham doubted the possibility of Sarah’s conceiving, in the same way that Moses asked, “If flocks and herds be slain for them, will they suffice them?” (Num. 11:22).</i> All this is meant by the words “Oh that Ishmael might live before thee,” which assert that it might be Ishmael who would be fruitful and have children who would inherit the land of Canaan. (In other words) he is saying, “God, in your words there are two mysteries that I do not understand. In either case what you have said is correct, for it is impossible for you to lie, for ‘God is not man that He should lie.’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">28.

                "Accordingly, “Oh that Ishmael …” should not be taken in the sense that stumbling women would speak, neither according to the ways of effeminate men. It is certain that when Moses wrote this scroll and express statement, which is the Torah and its narratives, (he did not intend to imply such doubts).",
                "The Lord then answers him, resolving both the first and second doubts in their proper order. He said to him: “Nay, but Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son, and thou shall call his name Isaac, and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his seed | after him.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">29. V. 19.</i> The meaning of this statement of God the teacher to Abraham His student is, “Regarding your doubt whether the decree that you will have a son from Sarah is necessary or contingent, know that it is necessary, even though there is no mention of a covenant or an oath in that context.” This is the meaning of His word “nay,” which is similar to “Nay, for we are guilty,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">30. Gen. 42:21. The JPS trans. is, “We are verily guilty.”</i> or wherever “nay” constitutes the first word of a sentence.

There Maimonides differentiates between the states of belief and certainty as follows: “Belief is the affirmation that what has been presented is outside the mind just as it has been represented in the mind. If together with this belief one realizes that a belief different from it is in no way possible, and that no starting point be found in the mind for a rejection of this belief, or for a supposition that a different belief is possible, there is certainty.” Kaspi repeats this definition in AS I 36.</i> and in accordance with the books of the philosophers.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">34. Cf. chap. V, n. 1.</i> Thus, with this separate word “nay,” the Lord informed Abraham that the decree “and moreover I will give thee a son of her” was for a necessary future event. The Lord told him, “While it is true that you are in doubt, and you have said that the future decrees mentioned above, including the vision of the Sundering, while true might refer to Ishmael—nonetheless know that the decrees are such that they refer to Isaac, who will be born of Sarah. And if there be a decree included in the above that does refer to both Isaac and Ishmael, and that says ‘I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations out of thee and kings will come out of thee,’ nonetheless the decree saying ‘I will establish my covenant between Me and thee and thy seed after thee,’ which follows, refers exclusively to Isaac.” This is the meaning of the words “I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his seed after him,” which are spoken at this point, as well as the meaning of “As for Ishmael, I have heard thee; behold, I have blessed him, and I will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">35. V. 20.</i> By way of further clarification of the above-mentioned covenant as described in the vision of the Sundering, God reaffirms that “my covenant will I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear unto thee.” The meaning of this statement is, “As for Ishmael, while I referred to him earlier when I said you would be multiplied—I was not referring to him at all when I said that I would establish my covenant (between me and thee and thy seed after thee); indeed I have not made any covenant with you that could refer to Ishmael.” At the close of the (prophetic) seclusion the Lord informs Abraham that in addition (Isaac will be born) “at this set time in the next year,” (for the conclusion of a vision) is the most auspicious.",
                "There is another great and remarkable observation. In several places I have written that the giver of the Torah, as well as those who established the Hebrew language in general, agreed to the usage whereby the past tense (of a verb) could be used to refer to the future, and vice versa.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">36. In <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 36) Kaspi explains that the words “I have set my bow in the cloud” (Gen. 9:13) refer simultaneously to the past and the future, for “the daily sphere has circled continuously since the creation of the world, therefore all future is necessarily described as the past, for these two tenses only have reference to the present.” Elsewhere (MK II 64, 104) he explains this usage as due to the fact that “the future is potentially the past, certainly when the future is close to being realized.” This point, alluded to later in the <i>Gevia’ Kesef</i> (chap. XVIII), is the esoteric doctrine referred to here, being that change is the actualization of potentiality. See Aristotle, <i>Physics</i> I, 7. This in effect blurs the distinction between past and future, permitting Kaspi to explain here that future and past are interchangeable. This is discussed above pp. 49–51.</i> As I explained, this is correct for several reasons, each instance depending on its particular signification and literal meaning. This method was one of the effective techniques used by the writer of the Torah to conceal esoteric doctrine, (using terms) that are in doubt or subject to interpretation, | which are a form of equivocation. Two such places are here, for the words <i>natati mimenah lekha ben</i> (lit. “I have given you a son of her”) refer exclusively to the future, as up to that point this had not been done, even in an esoteric sense. On the other hand, <i>beirakhti ’oto ve-hifreiti ’oto</i> (“I have blessed him and made him fruitful”) refers exclusively to the past, for earlier the Lord had said, <i>“ve-hifreiti ’otekha bi-me’od me’od</i> (“I will multiply thee exceedingly”),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">37. V. 2. Kimḥi explained that Ishmael was blessed earlier when the angel appeared to Hagar (Gen. 16:10).</i> which is an explicit utterance (of blessing being given).",
                "The phrase “As for Ishmael, I have heard thee” does not pose a problem by implying that Abraham had uttered a new prayer in the words “Oh that Ishmael might live before thee.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">38. He means that God’s words here might be taken to be providing a new blessing for Ishmael, in response to a new request that had been made by Abraham.</i> For the expression is equivocal, intentionally written in this attractive way by the writer of the Torah so that its exoteric sense be understood (as a new prayer).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">39. In the <i>Guide</i>, Introduction, Maimonides describes the second kind of parable as having many words, “not every one of which adds something to the intended meaning. They serve rather to embellish the parable and render it more coherent, or to conceal further the intended meaning …” Here Kaspi says that the details are both for coherence and concealment.</i> According to this exoteric explanation, the meaning of the verse, when God says “I will bless him and make him fruitful,” refers exclusively to the future (as blessings promised for the future in response to Abraham’s new prayer), as an event that will exist in the future. This will be either on account of its being presently spoken (as a blessing for the future) or because right now it is in potential. My own (preferred) explanation, however, is in accordance with the esoteric meaning and with precise philosophic insight. Both explanations here possess truth.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">40. He means that the esoteric meaning does not negate the exoteric or literal meaning. Kaspi’s attitude to the two levels of exegesis, the exoteric and the esoteric, is discussed at length in Chapter 2.</i> This is true of the entire Torah, in that every term and statement possesses a meaning within a meaning, both of which are true. It is similar in every science, in every means of expression and artistry, or artistic instrument.",

Undoubtedly it is always like this, but it is not always necessary that it be so written. In any case the meaning is clearly that it is God who removes Himself from the person.

XIII, pp. 216–217.</i> These matters are all very profound, to be understood by those who know the true nature of prophecy as explained by Maimonides in the <i>Guide</i> II:36, as well as (the true nature of) the rational, speculative faculty."

Consequently, in the present context he is saying that both the masses and the would-be philosophers accept the prevalent opinion that the oral tradition places its priority on the practical precepts, but that whereas the former practice those precepts, the latter scoff at them. Averroës appears to identify the would-be philosophers of contemporary Islam with the Kalamists, who confuse the masses and open the road to heresy. See A.

The student, i.e., the prophet, requests clarification of whether (the Lord’s) intention is to (all) the interpretations or some of them, and if to some of them, how many and which ones.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">5. He means that God’s words can be interpreted in several ways, and it is not always immediately clear to the prophet which interpretation is correct.</i> Regarding this variety of interpretations, there are many things to consider.

The only exceptions, Kaspi says here, are pronouncements that include an oath or a covenant.

Gen. 18:1.</i> Maimonides in the <i>Guide</i> II:36 wrote something in this manner: “It is known that a matter that occupies a man greatly—he being bent upon it and desirous of it—while he is awake and while his senses function, is that with regard to which the imaginative faculty acts while he is asleep …”",

BT <i>Berakhot</i> 55a: “a person sees in his dreams what his heart thinks about.” Aristotle (<i>On Dreams</i> 3, 460b) says: “… stimulatory movements, based upon sensory impressions, whether the latter are derived from external objects or from within the body, present themselves not only when the person is awake, but also when this affection which is called sleep has come upon them, with even greater impressiveness …” Averroës expands on this in the <i>Epitome of the Parva Naturalia</i>, ed. H. Blumberg (Cambridge: Mediaeval Academy of America, 1954), p. 45, saying that if one who sleeps feels as if he sees or hears, such a feeling has its beginning in the awakened state. But because the faculties of thought and memory do not function during sleep, the imaginative faculty can govern the soul unimpeded. The result is the distorted images of dreams. Such dreams cannot clarify rational truths, but occasionally do portend future events. This is reflected by Kaspi’s saying that the dream contained no rational truths, but only a future event, i.e., the birth of Isaac. (In the <i>‘Ammudei Kesef</i> (AM 117), Kaspi states that according to Averroës, prophecy always occurs when awake. This is not born out by our editions of the <i>Epitome</i>.) This presence of the imaginative faculty in prophetic dreams is used by Kaspi to solve another problem: the interpretation of such dreams likewise requires the active participation of the imaginative faculty of the interpreter. That faculty is aroused by a detailed description of the images in the original dream, thereby enabling the interpreter to reconstruct the “message” of the dream. In this way Kaspi explains (<i>Ṭirat Kesef</i>, MK I 124) the need for the Torah to repeat the many details of Pharaoh’s dream as recounted to Joseph. This solution, as offered by Kaspi, is likewise based upon Averroës’ <i>Epitome</i>, p. 52, where the whole process is compared to the physician’s diagnosis, which relies heavily on a complete description by the patient of the perceived symptoms experienced. For a similar analogy borrowed from Averroës, see above in Chapter 4, p. 120. It should also be noted that the <i>Commentary of Samuel ben Hofni Gaon on the Torah</i>, ed. by Aaron Greenbaum (Jerusalem: Mosad Harav Kook, 1978), p. 112, also says in the context of Pharaoh’s dream that “it is necessary for the interpreter of a dream to be very precise with the words of the dreamer in examining the dream … as is the case with a physician as well.” As this commentary was written at the end of the tenth century, it obviously antedates Averroës’ words quoted earlier, even though Greenbaum’s formulation appears to identify Averroës as Samuel ben Ḥofni’s source (cf. his n. 55 passim).</i> as, for example, when fools experience a nocturnal emission, and the wise experience the speculative sciences or future events, whether literally or metaphorically.

(These three were present) in the case of every prophet, with the exception of Moses our teacher, who had but two, their agnomen being the two cherubim,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">22. Exod. 25:22 states: “I will speak with thee from above the ark-cover from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony.” In the <i>Menorat Kesef</i> (AS II 109), Kaspi says otherwise, that the cherubim refer to the two upper worlds that dominate the third, lowest world.</i> i.e., the Active Intellect and the rational faculty.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">23.

These words, indeed the entire passage, should be contrasted with Kaspi’s words in <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i> (MK I 91–92) saying that this story teaches but one basic idea—the pleasurable nature of intellectual attachment. Consequently, he asserts that “one should not inquire as to details of the story, for they all follow from his initial imagining of the three men…. For this reason I am surprised that Maimonides says that there is a great secret here …” From the <i>Gevia‘ Kesef</i> here it is clear that Kaspi finds such esoteric doctrines through the careful analysis of the Scriptural text. On the significance of this passage for the general problem of Kaspi’s attitude to precise observation in Scripture, see above p. 60. Certainly there is room for modification of the statement that “Kaspi is the extreme opponent of every precise observation … mocking every question of a superfluity or omission in Scripture,” which is found in N. Leibowitz, ‘ <i>Iyyunim Ḥadashim Be-Sefer Shemot</i> (Jerusalem: World Zionist Organization, 1969), p. 66.</i> The intention here is to convey that Abraham persisted in his prophetic speculation, by holding on to the coattails of the Active Intellect to prevent it from passing away from him, as had previously occurred when “God went up from Abraham.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">30.

                "The sages were also careful in saying, “They appeared (<i>nir’u</i>) to Abraham in the image of people, for Abraham’s faculty was superior, while for Lot they were in the image (<i>nidmu</i>) of angels, as Lot’s faculty was weak.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">31. Our editions of <i>Genesis Rabbah 50</i> have <i>nidmu</i> in both cases, and in <i>Tanḥuma’ Yashan</i> they are reversed, with Abraham <i>nidmu</i> and with Lot <i>nir’u</i>.</i> Regarding this statement, Maimonides said in the <i>Guide</i> II:45 that “this is a great prophetic secret,” and this statement caused a problem for those who dabble in philosophy,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">32. Cf. above chap. XI, n. 1.</i> for they found that in the <i>Guide</i> II:45 Maimonides wrote | that the sight of an angel (in a prophetic vision) indicates a level that is superior to a vision where a person is seen. If, however, I have read well, then these dabblers in philosophy are not philosophers.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">33. He means that they are not yet complete philosophers, for if they were, they would see that there is no contradiction.</i> The reason is that in that place Maimonides arranges the levels (of prophecy) so that they occur in a dream as far as the seventh level; from there he begins with visions, which are superior to dreams, as it is written, “Do I in a vision make myself known to him, I do speak with him in a dream.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">34. Num. 12:6.</i> These two postulated categories constitute superior prophetic states, and within each category Maimonides in that chapter arranges the disparate levels. Now within each category he undoubtedly asserts that to see an angel is to experience a higher level than to see a person. Abraham and Lot, however, were not within the same category according to the two categories mentioned. They were in two separate categories in this episode, for Abraham experienced a vision, while Lot experienced a dream. The vision is a superior faculty, while the dream is an inferior faculty. For this reason they said that in the case of Abraham, whose faculty was superior, the angels “appeared to him,” while in the case of Lot, whose faculty was inferior, they appeared to him in an image.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">35. Cf. above n. 31.</i> Consequently, it was within this category (of visions) that Abraham saw people, a most propitious event, being the tenth level according to the enumeration of Maimonides. In the case of Lot, the event was the lesser of the two, for when at the end of the dream he saw angels, it was the sixth level in Maimonides’ enumeration. In summary, this statement of the sages, may their memory be blessed, says only, “Abraham in his vision saw people, while Lot in his dream saw angels.” It makes no difference if we say “superior faculty, inferior faculty” or “in a vision, in a dream” or “they appeared, they were in the image, he saw.” It is only that people think that different terms possess different (meanings).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">36. Other commentators to the <i>Guide</i> attempted to deal with this problem as well. Narboni says that in <i>Guide</i> II:6 the reference is not to the levels of prophecy but to the way in which a prophet perceives his soul, whether as angelic or human. Of the two perceptions, the latter is superior. Shemtov repeats this answer, as does Gersonides in explaining why the men in the case of Abraham changed to angels with Lot. Kaspi’s answer here was taken up by Ibn Crescas in his commentary to the <i>Guide</i>. Cf. also AM 93.</i> At the binding of Isaac, it states that Abraham saw angels, which corresponded to the eleventh level enumerated by Maimonides.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">37. <i>Guide</i> II:45, i.e, one level above the one achieved here.</i>",

V. 10.</i> which in my opinion is to be taken literally, one must say that He who gave the Torah intended this to be understood (as affirming that their conversation) included outwardly spoken words, similar to one who speaks in his sleep while dreaming.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">52. This is Kaspi’s first answer to the problem raised by Nachmanides in commenting on Gen. 18:1; i.e., how, according to Maimonides, could Sarah overhear the conversation if the entire chapter is only a vision that affected Abraham’s internal senses exclusively? The present answer is that Abraham might have spoken the words as they occurred in the vision. Kimḥi gives the same answer here, saying that “the sounds of speaking” emanate from the prophet, as in Dan. 10:7, “And I Daniel alone saw the vision; for the men that were with me saw not the vision; how-beit a great trembling fell upon them, and they fled to hide themselves.”</i> There is no doubt that most prophecies of the prophets, with the exception of Moses, were just like this. So in my opinion Sarah heard Abraham speaking with the angel, but without knowing (or) seeing the angel. It would also appear that she possessed one of the lower aspects of prophecy mentioned by Maimonides, especially in this chapter, where she secludes herself upon seeing her husband conversing with the angels through question and answer.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">53. This is a second answer to the above-mentioned problem. It might be prompted by the fact that the first answer does not explain how she heard the angels themselves speaking, for Abraham must have only mouthed his own words.</i> It was on that lower level that she prophesied, in a manner similar to the prophecy of Saul when he met the group of prophets.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">54.

They all changed the term to read <i>bi-ḳeroveha</i> (“her intestines”) to imply an organ inferior to the heart (cf. Rashi’s comments ad loc.).

This accords with the <i>Guide</i> II:6, “the meaning of an angel is a messenger … accordingly everyone who carries out an order is an angel.” In <i>Sharsherot Kesef</i> (TK 20), however, Kaspi says: “the Provençal of <i>mel’akhah</i> is <i>oeuvre</i>, and the Provençal of <i>mal’akh</i> is <i>oeuvrier</i>. Therefore the Provençal of <i>mal’akh</i> is not <i>messager</i>, meaning ‘a messenger’—with all due respect to Maimonides.

                "The second benefit is (that we are to learn) that it is correct for the Lord, as it is for us, to command something and then later (to command) its opposite, as was the case here.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">8. This statement is modified later in the <i>Gevia‘ Kesef</i>, chap.

                "The third benefit, besides that mentioned by Maimonides, one that is most precious, is the greatest principle for which the (chapter) was recorded. It was the fact that (Abraham) was prevented from carrying it out at the point when he was approaching the act (of sacrifice of Isaac). For this reason, the verse is careful to say that when He, may He be blessed, commanded this act, it was only by way of a test. Heaven forbid that He would command in such a manner as to intend its fulfillment. The<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">11. The section that begins here, continuing until “would act in that manner,” was quoted by Abraham b. Solomon in his Arabic commentary to the Prophets. Renan, <i>Ecrivains Juifs Français du XIVe Siècle</i> (Paris, 1893), p. 504, refers to this quotation from Kaspi, but is unable to identify it as coming from the <i>Gevia‘ Kesef</i>.</i> purpose (of the command) was to uproot, undermine, and weaken the established belief that was in the heart of the people, that those who are punctiliously careful take of their children to make sacrifices to their gods. Furthermore, while it is true that He who gave the Torah permitted them to take other forms of life as sacrifice to the Lord our God, as an expression of guilt, Heaven forbid that the human species be used for this purpose. This even includes the prohibition against passing through fire, as is seen from the careful omission of any mention of kindling of fire, even though the high priest would act in that manner.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">12. This reference is unclear. Perhaps Kaspi is referring to Lev. 16:27, “and they shall burn in the fire the skins and the flesh and the dung,” which Ibn Ezra explained was performed by the high priest on the Day of Atonement. Cf. Nachmanides to that verse.</i> While it does say earlier that “he took in his hand the fire,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">13.

V. 9.</i> Had this stated, “And he placed the fire under the wood,” or “… on the altar,” it would have been understood by foolish people as indicating that Abraham was at least (able) to pass Isaac through the fire.",
                "The significance (of that custom) is known from the Torah and Prophets, in that the ultimate sacrifice in those generations was to offer their children as a sacrifice to their gods, | whether that be by passing them through the fire,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">15. This custom only singed the body in the fire.</i> or to burn them completely, or to slaughter them and cast their blood as a food-offering to their gods.

In that verse it is not clear what was the purpose of that act of sacrifice at that point. Kaspi’s explanation agrees with that of Rashi, as opposed to Kimḥi.</i> It is known that one of our sins was that our people were unable to overcome such beliefs, in spite of all the prophylactic measures used by the Torah to make us understand the matter.",
                "Even Jephthah, who was not one of those considered wicked but only vain,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">19. Kaspi probably has in mind the following statement found in <i>Genesis Rabbah</i> 60: “Was there not Phinehas the high priest to absolve his vow? The answer is that Phinehas said, ‘He needs me, why should I go to him?’ While Jephthah said, ‘I am the chief-officer of Israel, why should I go to him?’”</i> in that he was not wise, actually meant to fulfill the will of the Lord when he swore, saying, “Whatsoever cometh forth out of the doors of my house to meet me … it shall be the Lord’s, and I shall offer it up for a burnt-offering.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">20. Judg. 11:31.</i> The meaning of “it shall be the Lord’s” is not as Ibn Ezra explained.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">21. There is no surviving commentary of Ibn Ezra to the Book of Judges, so this cryptic reference can only be guessed at. L. Levy, <i>Reconstruction des Commentars Ibn Ezras zu den Ersten Propheten</i> (Heidelberg, 1903), p. 10, contains a passage saying that Jephthah did execute his daughter, and would even have sacrificed an entire family, had it been the first to meet him upon his return home. A more likely version of Ibn Ezra’s view of this episode, and one that fits into the present passage of the <i>Gevia‘ Kesef</i>, is to be found in Nachmanides’ Commentary to Lev. 27:29. In that passage Nachmanides says: “Do not be misled by the error of Ibn Ezra, who says that … Jephthah intended that person to be separated from society to serve God in prayer and appreciation, while if it were to be an animal that met him, he would sacrifice it. Accordingly Jephthah built a house for his daughter outside of the city, where she secluded herself, and he supported her all her life, for she knew no man and was bound up there. Such an interpretation is vacuous …” Nachmanides himself is of the opinion that Jephthah’s daughter was in fact sacrificed. This agrees with Kaspi’s view in the passage following this one.</i> Jephthah did not consider the sacrifice of a human being an abomination to the Lord, so that when he said this later, he was not specific, for it never occurred to him that it might be his daughter, as did in fact happen.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">22. From this, as well as the following passage, it is clear that Kaspi, like Nachmanides, interpreted that episode as culminating in the daughter’s death. This view is opposed by Kimḥi and Gersonides (as well as Ibn Ezra, as we have seen), who in their commentaries to Judges explain the oath as dedicating her to the service of God for the duration of her life. A possible explanation for Kaspi’s rejection of Kimḥi and Ibn Ezra on this point, in spite of their general influence on his work, might emphasize Kaspi’s preference for a literal reading of Scripture. In the episode at hand, the literal meaning appears to point toward the actual sacrifice and death of Jephthah’s daughter. For views similar to Kaspi’s, cf. L. Ginzberg, <i>The Legendi of the Jews</i> (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1913), vol. IV, pp. 43–46, vol. VI, p. 203, n. 109.</i> His fate proves his lack of wisdom.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">23. It would have been more accurate to say, “his daughter’s fate proves his lack of wisdom.”</i> For in spite of everything, had he been wise he would have withdrawn his vow.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">24. Cf. n. 19.</i> Instead he imagined that the (consummation of his vow) was an act of great piety. While he read this episode (of Genesis) in particular, having read it he was not aware of this final cause, for he considered the Lord’s prevention of Abraham to be only an act of mercy on account of (Isaac’s being) an only son in (Abraham’s) old age. (So Jephthah thought that) whoever would carry this out would be more praiseworthy and pious, especially (for someone like) Jephthah, a young man in his prime.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">25. As a young man Jephthah could have other children, unlike Abraham.</i> It is possible that Jephthah expected an angel to call out to him, “Lay not thy hand upon the lad,” and continued to wait for it.",
                "So this foolish enthusiast sacrificed his only daughter in fire unto the Lord, in a similar manner to what the wise Abraham began to do with his only son, and similar to the act of the king of Moab in sacrificing his eldest son to his god Chemosh,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">26. Chemosh was the god of Moab, as in I Kings 11:7, 23.</i> as well as similar to the acts of some of our people, who in their sin sacrificed to idols.

The question is that this verse favors the explanation of Kimḥi and Gersonides (cf. n. 22) that it was her sexual satisfaction, not her life, that was at stake.</i> from the fact that it is written that the maiden said “bewail my virginity, I and my companions,” for these were none other than Miriam and her companions Hulda and Deborah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">30. The context would imply that all four of these women remained virgins; however, Judg. 4:4 describes Deborah as the wife of Lappidoth. The only other reference to these women as a group is in BT <i>Megillah</i> 14b, “There were two arrogant women and their names are evil—the one is Deborah, and the other Huldah.” Kaspi might include Miriam as an arrogant woman on account of her comment in Num. 12:2, “Hath the Lord spoken only with Moses, hath he not spoken also with us?” Accordingly, Jephthah’s daughter would be considered arrogant for bemoaning her virginal state.</i> She was but a complete fool, as was her father, and the reason that she did not bemoan her (impending) death was that she imagined that she would be saved, and thereby achieve the level of Isaac. She cried instead | over her virginity, which would be destroyed in (passing through) the fire, and would prevent the pleasure that would otherwise have been gotten by one of the young men beloved of her. There are many such nonsensical things (that could be attributed) to her and her girlfriends, who were undoubtedly many, as is evident from their subsequent gathering at the place of the burning to bewail her (fate).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">31.

Deut. 34:8.</i> where they did not even have the place where he died before them, for it was unknown.

Isa. 41:8.</i> (they gathered to bewail her where she had died).

According to BT <i>Bava’ Batra’</i> 14b, the author of Judges was Samuel the prophet.</i> for whom it was more than sufficient to write of this matter using hidden terms and words. This is certainly true in view of the fact that it is not necessary to write everything, as I have stated several times.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">36. For further discussion of the issue of Scriptural precision, see above pp. 60 ff.</i>",
                "In general, the Torah attempted to cure this serious disease that occurred in our people in those times, similar to the manner in which it is presented here.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">37. Ibn Ezra quotes Saadya’s explanation that the binding of Isaac was for the benefit of Abraham’s contemporaries, who would learn from his example. Maimonides, in <i>Guide</i> III:24, takes strong exception to this explanation, saying that the event was not known to anyone but Abraham and Isaac themselves. According to this view, the present phrase by Kaspi, “in those times,” must be taken to refer to the period when the Israelites were in the desert and, subsequently, in the land of Canaan, and not to the patriarchal era, since it was only in the later period, after the Book of Genesis was written, that they could have known of the episode. A similar theme is struck in Kimḥi’s comments to Gen. 22:1.</i> This is in accordance with my earlier words, stating that these books preface the commandments. For this reason, He who gave the Torah spoke at length in describing the offensive nature of this (child-sacrifice), when He said, “also their sons and daughters do they burn in the fire to their gods,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">38. Deut. 12:31.</i> an act that was particularly associated with Molech.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">39. See Lev. 18:21, 20:3.</i> For this reason too, the punishment for this sin is greater than all (other) sins, if sacrifice is made to others—quite the opposite of the thoughts of those who considered this child-sacrifice most appropriate for all people. It was enough—more than enough—that in one respect He permitted them to kill an animal, that which is our brother (species), the offspring of our father (genus that is known as) “living,” which is the category that most immediately encompasses us humans and the animals.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">40. In explaining the genealogical details that follow the binding of Isaac (Gen. 22:20–24), Kaspi says (<i>Ṭirat Kesef</i>, MK I 102–103) that the genus and species are to be compared to the father-and-son relationship, for one father can beget many children and grandchildren. Accordingly, genus corresponds to “living” while species would be “man,” with another species, such as livestock, to be considered a “brother” species. The importance that Kaspi attaches to these logical categories is discussed in Chapter 2, above pp. 48–49. One can also note the probable influence of Francis of Assisi in Kaspi’s attitude to the fate of animals and other forms of animate life, which is markedly sensitive to the death of animate beings—see, for example, Kaspi’s explanation for sending away the mother bird (<i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i>, MK II 293). For further discussion, see S. Pines, “Histabberut,” p. 315, and W. Bacher, “Joseph Ibn Kaspi als Bibelerklärer,” <i>Festschrift zu Herman Cohens Siebzigstem Geburtstag</i> (Berlin: Cassirer, 1912), pp. 119–135.</i> But while this was (permitted) with conditions, it was not so with relation to the human species, for man was created in the image of God. Consequently such worship entails the sin of murder and the sin of committing an abomination before the Lord, as I have explained.",
                "Notice the precision of Jeremiah’s words, for those who can understand. For he wrote in his book, and mentioned it three times, which is the number of sins of our people,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">41. Cf. Amos 2:4, 6, “For three transgressions of Judah will I not reverse it …”</i> that “they have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and daughters in the fire; which I commanded not, neither came it into my mind”;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">42.

He means this should be read as if: “which I did not even command you to sacrifice to me …”</i> And even though He commanded us to do this (sacrifice) for Him using animals, that was, so to speak, by force and through circumstance, as happened when He led the people round about by way of the desert,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">45. Exod. 15:37.</i> forced in a way lest the people turn back.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">46.

                "Jeremiah was also careful when he said, by way of “the Torah speaks in the language of men,” that “it neither came into my mind.” It means that “I never thought that after the express prohibitions anyone would make such a sacrifice of his children.” This is the meaning of “this abomination,” as if to say, “Had this occurred to me I might have commanded this to be done for me, for I have commanded them to do for me other things similar to this, until such time as their misconceptions be dissipated.”",
                "So in general the (main) purpose of writing this narrative in the Torah is this one. Perhaps, as Maimonides wrote,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">47. Maimonides (<i>Guide</i> III:24) said that Abraham established the unity of God, by drawing people to his faith.</i> its impact exists up to the present time. (Moses) wrote this (chapter) and did what he could, even though he saw at the end that the people would “rise up and go astray after the foreign gods of the land,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">48. Deut. 31:16.</i> (for he wanted) peace and truth in his own lifetime. (Moses) communicated this to them in the context of Abraham, our first patriarch, for God had prevented him from making such a sacrifice to Him, and Abraham had made the sacrifice to Him by substituting a ram, (teaching that) it is proper for us to do the same. It was especially on this account that He commanded that a ram be included in the sacrifices to be made to Him. While this was to be communicated to the masses, it was also to be understood, by the select individuals among us, that even the sacrifice of a ram and other animals was something not desirable to the Lord. Reliable evidence of this is that clearly, after God told him “lay not thy hand upon the lad,” it is not written that He said to Abraham, “instead offer a sacrifice to me using a ram or another (animal).” Instead it is stated that Abraham, of his own volition, “took the ram and offered it up for a burnt-offering instead of his son.” This was to teach us that (the sacrifice of the ram) was not the Lord’s first and primary intention. It is also careful not to say that Abraham sacrificed the ram on the altar that he had built, but (it says that) he offered it on the mountain,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">49. V. 14, “in the mount where the Lord is seen.”</i> as if to teach us that it is not proper to do such a thing on an altar, or on any attractive structure. The reason is that an altar without any sacrifice on it is more acceptable as a sign and a memorial, | as I said earlier.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">50. See chap VI, p. 161, where Kaspi indicates a preference for altars that serve as memorials rather than as places of sacrifice.</i> And though even an altar and house (of offering) are themselves not the most desired good, they are nonetheless more acceptable, if made, than is sacrifice, as Maimonides wrote.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">51. <i>Guide</i> III:32.</i>",
                "(The Torah) teaches us other vaunted secrets and beautiful wisdom, in the manner of all of the Lord’s works, of which the Torah is one—in accordance with the fact known to us that our Torah is from heaven.",
                "Accordingly, when it says here, “And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in the thicket by his horns,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">52. V. 13.</i> the words “lifted up his eyes” teach us that it was (an act) not consciously caused or intended, but rather was a circumstantial sighting, quite accidental, similar to “and Lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of the Jordan.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">53. Gen. 13:10.</i>",
                "The word <i>’ayil</i> (“ram”) teaches us in the first place that the sacrifice was of an animal. In the second place, by derivation from <i>’eilei ha-’areṣ</i> (“the mighty of the land”),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">54. Ezek. 13:17.</i> we learn that this was a matter of force, i.e., force, might, and coercion.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">55. He means that even the substitution of the ram and its sacrifice was an act of questionable desirability, the result of circumstance and contingency.</i> Furthermore (<i>’ayil</i> alludes to) the mighty of the land, in that ministers, deputies, and kings desire things such as this. In any case, there is a further implication by virtue of metathesis, i.e., to <i>ya’al</i>, as in “Moses took upon him (<i>ho’il</i>) to expound this law,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">56.

The only such reference is to be found in the Pseudo-Aristotelian <i>Problemata</i> XXII, 931b, 19–38, which explains why a stormy sea is calmed when objects are cast into that sea.

                "It is furthermore written, “behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns.” This indicates in the first place the matter of coercion, for the ram was caught in the thorns, held there with bonds that prevented anyone from taking it. The Torah indicates especially, by means of the term <i>sevakh</i> (“thicket”), which is derived from the contortion (<i>sibukh</i>) and confusion of thought, that the practice of sacrifice signifies confused thinking.",
                "The term <i>beḳarnav</i> (“by his horns”) indicates knowledge and mental representation, for (<i>ḳeren</i>) alludes to what is elevated and sublime, as in “my horn (<i>ḳarni</i>) is exalted”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\">60.

As for the sacrifice of the ram that is mentioned, (the lesson is) our forefather acted voluntarily, which was intended to assure that we would practice self-control (and not sacrifice).

                "Now notice the difference between the lesson that a fool will glean from the verses of the Torah and what a treasured individual will take from them. For in this episode, what is known to the select individual to be a complete abomination to the Lord is taken by the masses as something which, if completed, would constitute the pinnacle of worship and what is desired by God. This is certainly, primarily true of the masses of that generation to whom the Torah was given.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\">65. Kaspi’s attitude to that generation is summed up in <i>Tam Ha-Kesef</i> (TK 32) when he says, “they were an ordinary collection of masses,” who believed in all kinds of nonsense.</i> They must have been proud of the piety of Abraham, the progenitor, who wanted to sacrifice his only son, and would have been even happier in praising this father had he finished the act, priding themselves before their Egyptian and other neighbors. The Torah, which is perfect and without blemish, revealed the truth by using words and statements whose exoteric meaning points to things that will be understood by the foolish, but whose subtle and esoteric meaning points out the truth to the treasured few.

                "Maimonides excelled further in saying that the intention of the Torah, in informing us that the actual binding took place three days after the command, was so that we should not imagine that it was carried out in confusion and haste, but rather after considered thought.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">68. A similar thought is found in Rashi and Nachmanides in their comments on that verse.</i> For Abraham (must have) wondered how the Lord could command him to perform such an abomination as it was subsequently shown to be.

                "This consideration also provides one of the reasons that Abraham left the young men behind, in that it must have taken several days for Abraham to construct the altar by himself, with some help from the lad Isaac.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\">71. Accordingly, Isaac at the time was a young boy. This follows Maimonides’ belief that Isaac could not have been thirty seven, for in that case Isaac’s merit in accepting the sacrifice would far have exceeded Abraham’s. (This opinion is attributed to Maimonides by his son, Abraham Maimuni.) Cf. S. Baron, <i>A Social and Religious History of the Jews</i> (New York: Columbia University Press, 1958), vol. VI, p. 480, n. 90. Ibn Ezra suggested that Isaac was thirteen (in his comments to Gen. 22:4).</i> Other reasons for (leaving them behind) were the fact that they were inferior people, as our sages said, “they were people who are to be compared to an ass,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">72</sup><i class=\"footnote\">72.

                "He who gave the Torah was likewise careful not to mention that Abraham kindled any fire below the wood once Isaac was placed on the altar, in accordance with the reason that I discussed above. An additional reason was that the wood would have easily and swiftly caught fire, thereby giving off some smoke that might have suffocated Isaac.",

                "He who gave the Torah was furthermore careful in that the command (to sacrifice Isaac) is recorded as using only one name (without repetition), while in preventing (the sacrifice, the Torah records) “Abraham, Abraham,” where (the repetition) is to inform us that the royal edict to desist was more insistent than the command (to sacrifice had been). This allusion is intended for singular individuals, while for the masses (the repetition of the name) is taken to allude to the fact that the sword was already placed on Isaac’s neck, out of Abraham’s urgent desire to slaughter him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">76</sup><i class=\"footnote\">76. Such an explanation accords with Kimḥi’s comments.</i> The knowledgeable individual, however, will benefit from the first and truthful exposition.",
                "There is another careful usage by Him who wrote the Torah. When commanding the sacrifice, “God” is mentioned, not the glorious name (which is the tetragrammaton).

Neither does it say that (Abraham offered the ram) “to God,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">83</sup><i class=\"footnote\">83.

This is the case throughout the entire Torah, in that it arranges the benefits in accordance with these two categories that exist in the people. While because of (our many) sins one cannot appropriately consider the select few to constitute an (entire) category, nonetheless this could be compared to the sun and the moon, which, even though they be individuals, are called a species.",
                "The sum product of Maimonides’ comments on this episode, and of what I have said that was stimulated by him, is that there are many purposes for which the entire incident was recorded, which are in addition to the many benefits that are to be found in the several details of a story such as this.",

It is, however, almost certain that what should be inserted here is the second benefit listed by Maimonides in that chapter of the <i>Guide</i>, and which is here included in the parentheses. The omission of this benefit might not be entirely accidental, for its point is somewhat contradicted by Kaspi’s earlier statement (cf. above chap. X, p. 196) that Abraham was uncertain of his comprehension of God’s words in the earlier visions in chap. 15 of Genesis.</i> (as well as to teach us the confidence that a prophet has that his vision is accurate).",

                "The tenth benefit is found in the conclusion, from “and the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham a second time” until “… because thou hast hearkened to my voice.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">90</sup><i class=\"footnote\">90. Vv. 15–16.</i> (It is the promise of an earthly reward) because the masses will not uphold all or even a few of the (above-mentioned) nine goals, unless they know that there is this reward, and in order to receive a reward that consists of a material good, which pertains to this world.

Kaspi devotes one of the homilies in <i>Tam Ha-Kesef</i> (TK 1–7) to an examination of the rewards in both worlds and asserts that material rewards have as their only purpose “the achievement of wisdom and perfection.” For a discussion of Kaspi’s assertion that truth, the Torah, and philosophic wisdom are all “one,” see Mesch, <i>Studies</i>, pp. 96–106.</i>",
                "The Torah is careful to allude twice to reward. The first was at the beginning, when saying, “because thou hast done this thing and hast not withheld thy son, thy only son,” which refers to (Abraham’s obedience to) the command (to sacrifice).

In the <i>’Ammudei Kesef</i> there, Kaspi suggests that Maimonides simply forgot about that reference, but in the <i>Maskiyyot Kesef</i> he says that Maimonides’ intention was to assert the fact that Moses did not possess a strong faith at that stage. This interpretation of Maimonides must be kept in mind in reading the passage that follows in the present work, especially the phrase “any incomplete knowledge of the Lord.”</i> in general one cannot find any expression of (divine) anger in any of the books of the Bible, unless it be with reference to idolatry. Subsequently Maimonides implied that idolatry is a genus encompassing every mental thought that attributes to the Lord any emotions or shortcomings, or any incomplete knowledge of the Lord. Therefore no question is posed by the many places throughout the books of the Bible where one finds an expression of anger attributed to the Lord.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">7.

The same question had been asked by Maimonides in the <i>Shmonah Peraḳim</i> (Introduction to the <i>Ethics of the Fathers</i>), ed. M. D. Rabinowitz (Jerusalem: Mosad Harav Kook, 1962), p. 211, where in the eighth chapter Maimonides answered that God had not decreed which nation would enslave the Israelites—consequently the Egyptians chose freely to enslave them. In the absence of the <i>Kesef Sigim</i>, it is difficult to explain why Kaspi chose to ignore Maimonides’ answer in favor of an ambiguous passage in the <i>Guide</i>.</i> in addition to several other similar passages that I mentioned there, one should know that there is sufficient answer in what Maimonides wrote in the last chapter of the second part (of the <i>Guide</i>), when he said that Scripture usually attributes to the Lord every possible expression, including “acting,” “sending,” and “commanding,” that could refer to any existent, whether human or any other.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">17. <i>Guide</i> II:48.</i> This applies no matter if that (act) be natural, voluntary, or accidental. The response to the problem is clear—that even though Scripture stated that the Lord decreed and ordered in the case of Pharaoh and the Egyptians that they should do this, the truth of the matter is that they did this out of their own complete free choice. The Lord did not cause them in any essential way. It is the same with Nebuchadnezzar, as recounted in the narratives of Jeremiah, and with Sennacherib in the narratives of Isaiah. It is only that He who gave the Torah provided a common reason for the benefit of the masses when He said that Pharaoh and his people acted with more evil intent than what the Lord desired and had decreed.

He means that there are alternative avenues to follow, with other leaders impressing them. Kaspi’s words here imply that even had the Sodomites repented, the city would still have been destroyed. This is consistent with Kaspi’s general position regarding the immutability of divine decrees (cf. <i>Maṣref La-Kesef,</i> MK II 286 ff.); i.e., God had decreed that “the city” would be destroyed, but the exact meaning of “the city” would be clarified in the course of time, whether or not the inhabitants fled in repentance. This position of Kaspi reflects Ibn Ezra’s commentary to Exod. 33:21, which attempts to reconcile personal providence with the notion of fate as ordained by the stars. The example that Ibn Ezra uses is that of a city that is destined to be flooded and its inhabitants drowned. A prophet comes and warns them to repent before their fate is sealed; they obey him, repent, and leave the city. In their absence the river rises and floods the city. Thus Ibn Ezra reconciles divine providence with natural law. Kaspi appears to equate a divine decree with natural law in that neither can be changed permanently. For further discussion of this latter issue, see above Chapter 4.</i> (For example) Noah escaped without fleeing to another land, for the flood encompassed a great and broad area, and he was forced to construct an ark.

                "(The answer is that) he was still in some doubt regarding the decree’s statement that “yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown,” (whether its mode be) necessary or contingent.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">21. This distinction is discussed by Kaspi earlier in the <i>Gevia’ Kesef,</i> in chap. IX, above pp. 187-188.</i> For according to Hebrew, as well as the vernacular, it is known that when one says “city” or “land,” one can have reference to the land or the city as separate from their inhabitants, or (else) be referring to their inhabitants (alone) without (the land or city). One could also be referring to them all. Now Jonah saw that at least the inhabitants were escaping, so finally his doubt as to the sin of the city was resolved,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">22. He means that Jonah realized that “Nineveh” in the decree had referred to the city environs and not to the inhabitants thereof, at least not in the same way. In what follows he develops this further.</i> and he left it. In any case he desired to see the act of the Lord in destroying it, to know whether it would be similar to the destruction of Sodom (with) fire, brimstone, and salt<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">23. Cf. Gen. 19:24.</i> —or (whether it would be) with fire alone.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">24. Kimḥi, in his commentary to Jonah, explains that he left the city in the event that the people faltered in their repentance, in which case God might have determined once more to destroy the city. According to Kimḥi, the city was in fact not destroyed, whereas according to Kaspi it was.</i>",
                "Thus it became evident to Jonah, on the basis of several considerations, that the original decree, stating, “Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown,” which might have referred to both the city and its inhabitants, undoubtedly did refer (to them both), but (in different ways, for) the execution of the decree on the city was necessary, while what had been intended for its inhabitants was contingent, for that was how it happened.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">25. A similar, abbreviated answer is found in <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 288). Kaspi’s contention that the city was indeed destroyed would conveniently explain the problem bothering all the commentators: Why was Jonah so angry and resentful? Kaspi would explain that Jonah wanted to save the city as well.</i>",
                "Consequently there was no change in the will expressed by the word of the Lord in this instance, or in that of his prophet.

It was in reference to this that Solomon said, “he by his wisdom delivered the city.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">27.

Gen. 6:6. The question posed is that “did prove” and “now I know” imply that the events happened in a material sense. Kaspi’s answer is that these expressions were used in accordance with Abraham’s understanding of the matter, i.e., he thought that God was testing him in order to know whether he was God-fearing. Ibn Ezra’s interpretation of “the Torah speaks in the language of men” and Kaspi’s elaboration thereof, is discussed above pp. 57 ff.</i> For it is customary for people to say of a man who destroyed what he built, that “he repented having built …” This is certainly true if we know what Maimonides said in addition when he explained that statement,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">7. <i>Guide</i> I:29, “the interpretation of the verse [that ‘it repented the Lord that he had made man’] would be that God was angry with them.”</i> together with my exposition of the special case in which Joshua revealed the secret when he wrote the words “the men pursued after them,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">8.

                "Because the Torah was given to the masses at large, its author was forced to write terms and statements that accorded with their thinking, and that were suited to their beliefs and follies, for their own good. Now it is their accepted opinion that the Lord tests, and that He will know at a point in the future what He did not know previously. (Consequently) He who wrote the Torah was forced to permit them to retain some anthropomorphic beliefs. The one who practiced this to an extreme was Avicenna,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">10. Likewise in <i>’Adnei Kesef</i> (AK I 124) he says that Avicenna believed “that it is not proper to reveal to the masses that God is not corporeal.” Kaspi’s own preference is for a position similar to that of Averroës, whom Kaspi understood to have said that one should attempt to impart such truths, but to be most discriminating in the process, lest the masses lose their belief in God altogether. Cf. above p. 29.</i> but not, heaven forbid, Moses.

He means that by commanding Abraham to do this, God was in effect the distant mover and cause of Abraham’s actions. Accordingly the term <i>nissah,</i> being the <i>pi‘el</i> stem, is to be understood as a causative, i.e., “God caused Abraham to prove.”</i> This was one of the reasons for saying “and God did prove,” for that was a precise allusion to Abraham himself, or to his imaginative faculty and his nature,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">12. He means that Abraham was moved by his imaginative and other faculties to respond in the way that he did, whether awake or in a dream. Kaspi singles out the imaginative faculty as motivating Abraham, for as he pointed out in chap. XIV, sacrifice in general, and child-sacrifice in particular, is to be associated with the imaginative faculty, so Abraham, in attempting to fulfill God’s will, was acting in accord with that faculty.</i> which was the origin and cause of his action. This accords with the recorded definition of “nature” and “natural force.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">13. This might allude to Kaspi’s oft-stated position (see above chap. IX, p. 172) that nature can be viewed as being only an extension of God’s distant causation of events, or else as having an independent causative action. This reflects Maimonides’ position in the <i>Guide</i> II:48.</i>",
                "As for the phrase “offer him there for a burnt-offering,” there can be no doubt,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">14. The doubt that is contemplated is that this command of God would appear to be contradicted by the later command to desist, in v. 12, and that if so, there would appear to be a change in God’s words and decree. This would countervene Kaspi’s contention that God’s word is never changed.</i> for in the Hebrew language as well as in logic, every expression of movement does not necessarily refer to the consummation of the act. Sometimes the reference will be to a middle, beginning, or even prior to the beginning, on account of its being a proximate or distant potential.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">15. Accordingly, the original command was the equivalent of saying, “begin to offer him there for a burnt-offering …” which was indeed fulfilled by Abraham and not countervened by the angel of the Lord.</i> Thus, for example, we can say of “the child that will be born”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">16. Judg. 13:8.</i> that it writes, eats, is a prophet, or is wise—by virtue of it’s being in potential. As a rule, every adjective and verb will occasionally modify what exists in potential, as they do what is actual, for the term <i>nimṣa’</i> (“exist”) and <i>hayah</i> (“be”) are ascribed to everything, whether actual or potential.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">17. A similar point was made by Kaspi earlier in the work (chap. X, p. 200), in reference to the use of future and past tenses in Hebrew, which Kaspi believes reflects the Aristotelian doctrine of actuality and potentiality. Here Kaspi extends his observations to include the injunctive form; i.e., a command to act may only be a command to create the potential for that act. See also above pp. 49 ff.</i> Furthermore, what exists (in actuality) only in the soul (is to be considered) as if existing outside of it as well. So, too, what exists only as the spoken word, (is to be considered) as if existing outside the soul. Proof are the words of the writer of the Torah, who, when he wrote, “I was restored unto mine office and he was hanged,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">18. Gen. 41:13.</i> revealed (this truth), for that had only existed as the spoken word.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">19. What Kaspi means is that the verse implies that the chief butler considered Joseph to have caused the baker to be hung and the butler to be reinstated. Such an opinion is referred to by Ibn Ezra in his comments on this verse. According to such an approach, what existed only in potential was already actualized in Joseph’s mind. This accords with Kaspi’s statement (<i>Maṣref La-Kesef,</i> MK II 90) that what exists in the mind is no less than what exists outside of it, while speech, too, confers existence upon that of which it speaks.</i> He also wrote that Jacob said, “which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">20. Gen. 48:22. In the <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 104) Kaspi says that this verse will be explained in the <i>Gevia‘ Kesef.</i></i> which was (only) potential.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">21. He means that even though this was only to be realized at some future time, in Jacob’s mind it was realized and actualized already, and for this reason Jacob spoke of it in the past tense. Ibn Ezra’s commentary to that verse records a similar interpretation.</i> He further wrote, regarding Jeremiah, “and you gave them wine to drink,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">22. Jer. 35:2, which the JPS translation has, “and give them wine to drink,” but in Heb. <i>ve-hishḳita.</i></i> (even though) it was still in potential and close to realization. In the context of Jeremiah it is written, regarding the unspoken and spoken word, “See, I have set thee this day over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root and to pull down, and to destroy and to overthrow; to build and to plant,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">23. Jer. 1:10.</i> i.e., that the villages and the houses (would be destroyed by Jeremiah) by hand, but not rebuilt by (Jeremiah’s) hand.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">24. He means here too that Jeremiah considered those potential events to be already actualized, even though he would do no more than speak to attain those goals.</i> There are several such metaphors in Scripture. All this is true in accordance with true logic. These are logical principles upon which the entire Torah and Prophets depend. As for the rest of this vision, I already dealt with those matters at length."

It was for that reason that I composed the <i>Ṭirat Kesef,</i> in order to explain the purposes of the stories (in the Torah), all of which are categorical statements known as <i>’imrah</i> (“affirmation”), in the same way that Maimonides explained the purposes of the commandments, all of which are noncategorical statements.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">3. Maimonides, in the <i>Guide</i> III:25-50, provides a detailed rationale of the commandments of the Torah. Kaspi’s reference to the <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i> as intended to explain the purposes of the narratives in the Torah is consistent with the description in the <i>Ḳevuṣat Kesef.</i> On the distinction between categorical and noncategorical statements, see <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i> (MK I 1-2).</i>",
                "What I will write here relates to the issue of the excessive length (of those stories), as well as their repetitiveness. Excessive length in any description that might be, is necessary for the masses, in that one of the purposes of the Torah is that it be accessible to the mass of women and children, as I have written. Now while it is true that the singular individuals can be satisfied with abbreviated terminology, this is not the case with the masses, for nothing will make an impression on them unless there is a lengthy description.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">4. In the <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i> (MK I 110) he says that “through repetition one’s memory is reinforced, and one’s impression is deepened.”</i> For this reason it was necessary (for the Torah) to dwell at length on the subject of curses and blessings, particularly when (Moses) died, (and the prolixity extended) to cover all of Deuteronomy.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">5. As Kaspi explains in the next chapter, the blessings and curses in the Torah are for the benefit of the masses, who should believe in their efficacy. Deuteronomy, with its surfeit of blessings and curses (cf. Deut. 27 ff.), was therefore perceived by Kaspi as intended for the masses.</i> In addition to reiterating for their sake, (Moses) repeated several things for the benefit of us who read the Torah today. Thus he said “a copy of this law,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">6.

According to the rabbinic division of the Torah into fifty-four portions, approximately parallel to the number of Sabbaths, Exodus is read in the winter and Deuteronomy in the summer, with the result that the readings are equally spaced for maximum impact.</i> In spite of this, (those things) are not impressed on our hearts.",

Ezek. 21:32.</i> and many others like it. This purpose was pointed out by Him who gave the Torah most notably in the case of Joseph, who told Pharaoh, “For that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice, it is because the thing is established by God.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">10.

Cf. above chap. VIII, p. 170, where Kaspi explains that Genesis is intended primarily for the select individuals, whereas the later portions are for the masses.</i> The reason for this is that the Torah was to be handed to the masses (as well as) the singular individuals, which are opposites. So it was necessary to write some things exclusively for the select few, | and some things exclusively for the masses. The part that is intended for “the individuals of truth” relates to the subjects of the Account of Creation and the Account of the Chariot.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">14.

The part that is exclusively for the masses includes most of Leviticus, which is mostly sacrifices and related things that include all the sacrificial rites. Sacrifice was one of the most necessary practices for the masses to be able to rely on its performance, just as the select few rely on intellectual truths. For this reason Moses impressed this act upon their hearts,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">15.

VI.</i> by describing the sacrifices of the princes at length. Thus, while they were all of a kind, he recorded the sacrifice twelve complete times—whereas had this been a matter concerning the select few, it would have sufficed to write the procedure followed by the first prince, and then said, “and thus did each one.” That would have been the same as in the case of the six branches of the candelabra,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">16.

Deut. 23:3, which does not repeat all the possible objects that might be lost.</i> for the Torah customarily uses analogy based on specific example, which is known as a principle of logic.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">19. This refers to the third of the thirteen rules of Talmudic hermeneutics, as formulated by Rabbi Ishmael (in the introduction to the <i>Sifra’</i>), which states that “a general principle [<i>binyan ’av</i>], as contained in one or two Biblical laws, is applicable to all related laws.”</i> Thus, the Torah will mention a specific instance or one component, and will then make a generalizing statement, and if that is not done (explicitly), then it will be implied. (Such a case is) that which is written in the Torah, “thou shall make a parapet for thy roof,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">20. Deut. 22:8, and MT <i>Roṣe’aḥ</i> 11:4.</i> which Maimonides explained as being a generic commandment (encompassing) the removal of every obstacle from one’s house, every stone that abuts, every nail on the ground, as well as whatever is similar to this.",
                "So the reason for the lengthy repetition time and again, which is again summarized and totaled species by species,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">21. Num. 7:84-88 provides the aggregate of all the twelve days of sacrifice.</i> as it appears in the sacrifices of the princes, (has as its purpose) to impress upon the masses how great people should offer gifts and donations to the Lord, and by extension so should every person. Now the princes brought exceedingly large gifts (to be sacrificed), but when Moses saw that they were approaching simultaneously to sacrifice the six covered wagons and the rest, he knew that it would not make as great an impression on the masses who were looking on as would be the case were they to do it over a period of days. For that reason he commanded them to bring their sacrifices during twelve days, so that one prince each day would bring his sacrifices to the dedication of the altar. Thus the Israelite masses would gather day after day for twelve days to see this (spectacle).",
                "Now in the same way that we who see the twelvefold | repetition of each paragraph are so deeply impressed, so that even though we might not absorb the description of the six covered wagons when we see it in Scripture or hear it once a year being read, we would (certainly) absorb those sacrifices that are read and heard twelve times,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">22. The description of the six covered wagons precedes the enumeration of the twelve days of sacrifice.</i> so too with the bullocks of the festival of Tabernacles. The reason is that He who gave the Torah was forced to have the masses believe that sacrifice is cherished by God, as the masses do indeed believe. All the nations also (believe this). Thus, in accord with the thinking of the masses, He said, “for a sweet savor unto the Lord,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">23.

From the passage that follows, it appears that the question inquired what effect blessings or curses could possibly have on the well-being of the recipient, for reason would indicate that the Torah bestows rewards and punishments according to what is deserved, and not according to any verbal pronouncements that might be made. If so, why does the Torah enumerate and emphasize the events surrounding blessings and curses?</i> it is thus: know that it is necessary for the masses to believe in general that in regard to blessings and curses, a blessing will bring about some good, while a curse will cause harm.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">2. Kaspi’s answer is that actually verbal pronouncements of blessing and curse have no objective effect that in some metaphysical way affects the fortunes of a recipient—instead such pronouncements have other benefits that are of a political nature. It is only a mistaken belief of the masses that there is some metaphysical effect of a blessing or a curse.</i> This is certainly (to be believed if that blessing or curse issues) from the mouths of the zealous and favored of the Lord.

                "Thus it is altogether necessary to establish a firm belief in the benefits of blessings and the harmful effects of curses, in the imagination of the masses.

These and similar practices, as carried out by the Geonim, are documented in S. Assaf, <i>Ha-‘Onshin Aḥar Ḥatimat Ha-Talmud</i> (Jerusalem, 1922), pp. 32 ff. On the use of such customs as an aid in Kaspi’s exegesis, see above Chapter 2 and chap. VI, n. 6. The present instance is consistent with Kaspi’s insistence (cf. <i>’Adnei Kesef</i> AK 152) that prophetic actions were designed so as to have maximum impact on the masses.</i> It was particularly for this reason that Moses instituted “these shall stand … to bless … and these shall stand … to curse …”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">6.

Balaam himself declared, “when He hath blessed I cannot call it back” (Num. 23:20)—if so, why did God intercede in the first place?</i> the explanation is clearly that that fool was universally known for the fact that whomever he blessed was blessed, and whomever he cursed was accursed. Consequently Moses was forced to have them believe that (Balaam) had not cursed them but had 154a blessed them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">15. Kaspi’s answer is that in fact there was no metaphysical effect that might have issued from his pronouncements. The reason for God’s precautions was the belief of the Israelite masses that there was just such an effect, and it was that belief itself which was a source of danger, as Kaspi now goes on to explain.

In the above passage of <i>Menorat Kesef,</i> Kaspi asserts that the idea of the ascending ladder representing the three worlds of the universe (on these worlds cf. above chap.

Altmann has pointed out in “The Ladder of Ascension,” <i>Studies in Mysticism and Religion Presented to G. Scholem</i> (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1967), p. 24, that Kaspi, by identifying this ladder with the Universal Soul as developed in Batalyawsi, was reverting to the Neoplatonic concept of the Universal Soul.</i> For we would be correct to imagine the entire universe as a ladder, whether we begin at the top and descend to the bottom (or we begin at the bottom and ascend to the top).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">4.
