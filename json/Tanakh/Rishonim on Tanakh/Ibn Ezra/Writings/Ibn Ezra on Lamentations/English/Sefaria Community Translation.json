            "Men of truth will understand in the ancient Midrashim of our righteous ones, which are founded on beauty, and through the casting of knowledge they are formed. And all their words are like gold and silver, refined seven times. Indeed, their Midrashim are divided into many ways. Among them are riddles and secrets, and lofty parables that reach the heavens. And from them, one can gain satisfaction in deep chapters, and from them, adopt the fallen and fill the empty. Therefore, they resemble bodies—tastes of verses and Midrashim cling to them. Some are as delicate as silk, and others are thick like sacks. The plain meaning is the body, in chosen words and statutes. And so they said that the Scripture is according to its plain meaning, and the ancient words. And I, Abraham bar Meir from distant lands, was brought forth from the land of Spain, the land of oppressors. And these books, in my exile, I held in my hands, and they taught me to explain the books with sweet flavors. And thus, I will elucidate this revelation after meticulous scrutiny, and it is not the burnt scroll by the hand of Jehoiakim. For the two words of the Name, which are inscribed in the Book of Jeremiah, are not found. And it is also written, \"Take for yourself a scroll and write on it all the words that I have spoken to you concerning Israel, Judah, and all the nations.\" And it is further written, \"Why have you written on it, saying: 'The king of Babylon will surely come and destroy this land'?\" And in the Scroll of Lamentations, there is no mention of Babylon or its king."

In the phrase \"Vatechazeik Mitzrayim\" (ותחזק מצרים), Mitzrayim is used in the masculine form. There are interpretations from the ancient religious sages (ז\"ל) that explain \"Dina DeMitzra\" (דינא דבר מצרא) - the law of Egypt. However, the straightforward interpretation in my opinion is \"Min HaMitzra\" (מן המצר), and if it differs slightly, the letter \"Hey\" should be emphasized. We find a similar pattern of masculine and feminine in \"Bayit\" (בית) and \"Makom\" (מקום)."
