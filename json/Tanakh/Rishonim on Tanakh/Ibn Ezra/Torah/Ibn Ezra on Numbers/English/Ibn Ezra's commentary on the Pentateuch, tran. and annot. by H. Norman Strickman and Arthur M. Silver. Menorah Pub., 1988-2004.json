For example, 12 is written <i>shenem</i> (2) <i>asar</i>; 13, <i>sheloshah</i> (3) <i>asar</i> (10); etc. However, the word for eleven in our verse is <i>ashte asar</i> and not <i>ahad</i> (1) <i>asar</i> (10).</i> The word <i>ashte</i> in (<i>ashte asar</i>, eleven) is similar to the word <i>eshtonotav</i> (his thoughts) (Ps. 146:4). It (<i>ashte</i>) refers to that which a person’s thoughts give birth to. The number ten, as it were begets [eleven, etc.]. This is a great secret.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to I.E., “Ten is the foundation of all sums, for all sums that follow ten are made up of a part or parts of ten, or come into being by doubling ten, multiplying ten, or a combination of the two” (<i>The Secret of the Torah</i>, p. 163).</i> Rabbi Jonah the Sephardi<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jonah ibn Janach, the eleventh-century grammarian.</i> says that <i>ashte asar</i> is short for <i>al shete asar</i>. Its meaning is, the number that precedes twelve.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, <i>ashte asar</i> means eleven.</i> Now Rabbi Jonah made two great mistakes. One, contrary to his words, the number twelve is beyond (<i>al</i>) the number eleven.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, the word <i>al</i> means above, not before. Hence if <i>ashte asar</i> is short for <i>al shetem asar</i>, then its meaning is, not before 12 but beyond 12.</i> <i>From twenty years old and upward</i> (va-ma’alah) (Num. 1:3) is proof of the aforementioned.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Va-ma’alah</i> and <i>al</i> come from the same root. We thus see that <i>al</i> means upward or beyond, not before.</i> His second mistake is that if the word <i>ashte</i> is short for <i>al shete</i>, then the text should have read <i>ashne asar</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Because the word for 12 is <i>shenem asar</i>.</i> not <i>ashte asar</i>. For <i>ashte</i> is in the feminine.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to Rabbi Jonah, <i>ashte</i> is short for <i>shetem asar</i>. <i>Shetem asar</i> is feminine.

However, it appears to me that Balaam was an astrologer. When Balaam saw in the star of a given person that an evil time had befallen him, he would curse him. When evil befell the one whom he cursed, then those who witnessed and heard the imprecation thought that the evil came because of Balaam’s curse. The fact that Balaam spoke with guile to the lords of Balak is proof of this.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">86</sup><i class=\"footnote\">First he told them that he couldn’t curse Israel.
