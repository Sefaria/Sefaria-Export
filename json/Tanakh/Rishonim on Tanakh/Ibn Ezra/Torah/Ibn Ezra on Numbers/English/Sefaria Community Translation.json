It is found both as praise and in a prophet’s manner of speaking. There are those who say that Moshes ruled over Ethiopia (the land of Kush) and married the Kushite (woman). Targum Onkelos says that she was beautiful and it was the language of respect just as the Ishmaelites call tar ‘white stuff (ha-lavan)’, so we call the blind person, ‘full of light’ (a euphemism). And thus it isn’t clear whether it is called a word that is meant to be praise that they turned into criticism. Meanwhile, there are those who say that the son of Kish (קיש) the Benjamite was Saul and thus from here on out, [I will translate the word] as the people of Kush (the Kushites). This is already its plain meaning. Thus the correct interpretation in my eyes is that this Kushite was Tzipporah for she was a Midianite and Midianites are Ishmaelites. (These peoples) live in tents (See Habbakuk 3:7: \"The tent curtains of the land of Midian were trembling. The earth quaked.) and because of the heat of the sun, they have no whiteness among them. Tzipporah was dark and looked like a Kushite."

And it bothered them that they were no longer trusted to remove the firstborns from the Kohanim and give it all up to Moshe's family alone. All of this occurred during the sin of the Golden Calf for then they were seen as complete when they surpassed the firstborns who were worshiping since they were then the priests.
