                "If you gain enlightenment about this passage, you will understand that His great Name came down upon the mountain and dwelt there in fire, and it was this that spoke with Moses. Throughout this passage, it is \"The Lord\", Yud Hey Vav Hey, who speaks with Moses, and the going up (v.3) and the leading out (v.17) are toward the place of the Presence, as I have explained in my comment to v.3 It was \"the Lord\" upon whom the people were warned \"not to break through...to gaze\" (v.21). For even the nobles of Israel did not see the Lord -- \"they beheld God\" (24:11) -- but all of Israel heard the Lord's voice from the fire. It is true that \"God spoke all these words\" (20:1) but as our Sages said, \"God\" represents Him in his aspect as judge. But they also say that Israel heard the first two commandments  \"from the mouth of the almighty,\" that is the Lord. And, of course, as Deut. 5:19 makes clear, \"The Lord spokes those words ...to your whole congregation at the mountain.\" Deut 5:4 says, \"Face to face the Lord spoke to you on the mountain out of the fire? does not contradict this; the the Israelites were speaking to Moses of what they themselves had apprehended, the Voice speaking. In Deut 5:24 they say , \"you go closer and hear all that the Lord our God says.\" Similarly, when Moses asks, \"Has any people heard the voice of God speaking out of the fire, as you have, and survived?"
