The second one was the plague of rash, for the Torah calls the sky above their head the heavens (and Moshe began the plague of rash by throwing the furnace soot heavenward). The seventh plague (hail) was a mixture of the sphere of storm and fire, as the Torah describes (9:24): “There was hail and fire flashing among the hailstones.” The eighth plague, locusts, came from far away by means of the wind. The ninth one was a wondrous plague, in which the light of the luminaries and the stars disappeared from the land of Egypt.
