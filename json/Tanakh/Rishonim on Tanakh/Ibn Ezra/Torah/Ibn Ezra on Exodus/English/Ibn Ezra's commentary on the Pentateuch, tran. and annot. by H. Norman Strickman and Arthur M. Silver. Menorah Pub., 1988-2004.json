The printed editions omit it as they do many of the other poems which introduce Torah portions in I.E.’s <i>Commentary</i> on Exodus. Some manuscripts open with the following introduction: Abraham’s commentary on the book of Exodus, finished in the year 4913 (1152-53 C.E.), is as precious as onyx. However, other commentaries give the date 4927 (1166-67 C.E.) as the date of the manuscript’s completion. E. Levine notes, “Some writers have held that the 1152-53 date refers to the long commentary whereas the inscription 1166-67 refers to the short commentary; others have maintained that the 1152-53 refers to the short commentary and the 1166-67 refers to the long commentary which was written precisely between 1159 and 1167 C.E.” See Foreword.</i> in the very ark<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Hebrew, <i>ba-aron be-kemutzot</i>. The reference is to I.E.’s commentary on Exodus. Commenting on the word <i>ba-aron</i> (in a coffin) in Gen. 50:26, I.E. explains, “The reason why <i>ba-aron</i> is vocalized with a <i>kamatz</i> is that it signifies the coffin which he had prepared for himself.” (See notes on Gen. 50:26.) The word <i>aron</i> can refer to an ark or to a coffin. I.E. is being a bit morbid.</i> which is the house which the author prepared for himself.I now begin to explain the Torah portion, <i>Shemot;</i> which opens the second Book of the Torah. ",
                "NOW THESE ARE. Our book opens with a <i>vav</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The book of Exodus opens with the word <i>ve-elleh</i> which literally means, and these are, and is so translated by I.E. The question thus arises, why open a book with a connective? Indeed, Deut. 1:1 opens with <i>elleh ha-devarim</i> and not with <i>ve-elleh ha-devarim</i>. Similarly, Exodus should have read <i>elleh shemot</i> and not <i>ve-elleh shemot</i>.</i> because the end of Genesis relates that <i>Joseph saw the children of the third generation</i> (Genesis 50:23).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis concludes by relating that <i>Joseph saw the children of the third generation</i>, i.e., that he was fruitful. However, it does not tell us about the fate of his brothers. The latter is related to us at the beginning of Exodus where we are told that <i>the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly</i> (Ex. 1:7). Thus the opening part of Exodus is connected to the closing section of Genesis. Hence the connective <i>vav</i>.</i> Scripture notes that Joseph’s brothers were few in number when they descended to Egypt but that they were fruitful and multiplied there (Exodus 1:7).The word <i>elleh</i> (these) and <i>el</i> (these) are employed equally with the masculine and the feminine. We thus find, <i>For all these abominations</i> (ha-to’evot ha-el)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word <i>to’evot</i> (abominations) is feminine.</i> (Leviticus 18:27) and then afterward, <i>any of these abominations</i> (ha-to’evot ha-elleh) (Lev. 18:29). We similarly read, <i>unto these men</i> (la-anashim ha-el) (Gen. 19:8); <i>These four</i> (arba’at elleh) <i>were born to the giant</i> (II Samuel 21:22); <i>and what can I do this day for these</i> (la-elleh) <i>my daughters</i> (Gen. 31:43). The same is the case with the word <i>laz</i> (that one).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It too is employed both with the masculine and the feminine.</i> We thus find, <i>that Shunamite</i> (ha-shunammit ha-laz) (II Kings 4:25) and <i>this young man</i> (ha-na’ar ha-laz) (Zechariah 2:8). The fact that the word <i>elleh</i> is penultimately accented indicates that its <i>heh</i> is superfluous.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The basic word being <i>el</i>. The <i>heh</i> added to the word has no meaning.</i> It is like the <i>heh</i> of <i>laylah</i> (night)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The basic word being <i>layil</i>.</i> and the <i>heh</i> of <i>nachlah</i> (brook) in <i>the Brook of</i> (nachlah) <i>Egypt</i> (Numbers 34:5).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The usual form is <i>nachal</i>.</i>",
                "[THE NAMES OF.] <i>Shem</i> (name) is masculine. Its plural form is <i>shemot</i> (names), for the <i>tav</i> is used for both the masculine and the feminine.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hence the word <i>shemot</i> can be a plural masculine. I.E. makes this point because generally speaking only feminine plurals end in a <i>tav</i>.</i> Compare, <i>mekomot</i> (places)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Its singular is <i>makom</i>, which is masculine.</i> and <i>avot</i> (fathers). The <i>mem</i> is similarly used as a masculine and feminine plural. Compare, <i>nashim</i> (women) and <i>pilagshim</i> (concubines).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These words are obviously feminine.</i> We also find some nouns employing both the <i>tav</i> and the <i>mem</i> in the plural forms. Compare, <i>nefashim</i> (souls) (Ezekiel 13:20) and <i>nefashot</i> (souls)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Nefesh</i> is feminine.</i> (Ezek. 13:18). We similarly find, <i>levavot</i> (hearts) (II Chronicles 28:9) and <i>levavim</i> (hearts).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Levav</i> (heart) is masculine.</i> Compare, <i>al livvehen</i> (upon their hearts)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Livvehen</i> is made up of the plural <i>levavim</i> plus the suffix for their.</i> (Nahum 2:8).[Into Egypt.] The <i>heh</i> of <i>mitzrayemah</i> (into Egypt) is in place of the word <i>el</i> (to). Compare, <i>dotayenah</i> (to Dothan) in <i>nelekh dotayenah</i> (let us go down to Dothan) (Gen. 37:16); and <i>yerushalayemah</i> (to Jerusalem) in <i>and brought me in the vision of God to Jerusalem</i> (Ezek. 8:3).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yerushalayemah</i> is equivalent to <i>el yerushalayim</i> (to Jerusalem) and <i>dotayenah</i> to <i>el dotan</i> (to Dothan). Similarly, <i>mitzrayemah</i> is equivalent to <i>el mitzrayim</i> (to Egypt).</i>",
                "WITH JACOB. <i>Et ya’akov</i> means with Jacob.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Et</i> is usually placed before the direct object. Here it is used as a preposition meaning with.</i> Compare, <i>In that day the Lord made a covenant with</i> (et) <i>Abram</i> (Gen. 15:18).",
                "EVERY MAN CAME WITH HIS HOUSEHOLD. <i>Beto</i> (his household) refers to those who came out of his loins. The term <i>bayit</i> (house, household) in Scripture never refers to a wife.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Talmud uses the term <i>bayit</i> (house) as a synonym for wife. Cf. <i>Sabbath</i> 118b: “Rabbi Jose said, I never called my wife, my wife but I called her my house.” Also see <i>Yoma</i> 2a, “<i>Beto zo ishto</i> (<i>His household</i> [Lev. 16:18] refers to his wife).”</i> <i>Every man came with his household</i> (beto) is proof of this, for the wives of the tribes are not included in the seventy who descended into Egypt.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gen. 46:8-27 lists the seventy descendants of Jacob who came to Egypt. Women are not enumerated. In fact they are specifically excluded (Gen. 46: 26). This proves that <i>beto</i> does not mean one’s wife.</i> Do not permit the verse <i>and</i> (the high priest shall) <i>have made atonement for himself, and for his household</i> (beto) (Lev. 16:18) to cause you any difficulty.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Pentateuch states that on the Day of Atonement the high priest shall make atonement <i>for himself and for his household. Prima facie</i>, “his household” seems to refer to the wife of the high priest. See end of note 18.</i> For according to the plain meaning of the text, <i>beto</i> (his household) refers to his father’s house. <i>Beto</i> (his household) must be so interpreted because the high priest made three confessions on the Day of Atonement.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Torah states that the high priest shall make atonement <i>for himself, and for his household and for all the assembly of Israel</i> (Lev. 16:18). According to the Talmud the making of atonement refers to confession of sins (<i>viduy</i>). Cf. <i>Yoma</i> 36b. The three confessions offered by the high priest were on behalf of himself (<i>for himself</i>), on behalf of the house of Aaron (<i>his household</i>), and on behalf of the people of Israel (<i>and for all the assembly of Israel</i>).</i> The priest’s helpmate, who is his wife, is included in the term <i>for himself</i>. She is included with him because a husband and a wife make a “man.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <i>Yevamot</i> 63a: “Any Jew that has no wife is not a man.” Also see Gen. 1:27, <i>And God created man…male and female created He them</i>.</i>"

                "REUBEN. When a word beginning with a letter that is vocalized with a mobile <i>sheva</i> (<i>sheva na</i>), e.g., the <i>zayin</i> of Zevulun, has a <i>bet, vav, kaf</i>, or <i>lamed</i> prefixed to it, the prefix ideally should also be vocalized with a mobile <i>sheva</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>bet, vav, kaf</i>, and <i>lamed</i> are prepositional prefixes. They are usually vocalized with a mobile <i>sheva</i>. I.E. explains the rules of the vocalization of the prefixes in this note because a connective <i>vav</i> is prefixed to many of the names of the sons of Jacob listed in our chapter.</i> However, due to the impossibility of sounding two mobile <i>sheva’im</i> in succession these prefixes are vocalized with a <i>chirik</i> rather than with a <i>sheva</i>. Hence if the word <i>zevulun</i> has a <i>bet</i> prefixed to it we say <i>bi-zevulun</i> (in Zebulun), If <i>zevulun</i> has a <i>kaf</i> or <i>lamed</i> prefixed to it we say <i>ki-zevulun</i> (like Zebulun) or <i>li-zevulun</i> (to Zebulun). However, if the word has a <i>vav</i> prefixed to it then it is vocalized with a <i>shuruk</i> rather than a <i>chirik</i>. We sound the <i>vav</i> as if it had an <i>alef</i> preceding it and pronounce the word <i>u-zevulun</i> (and Zebulun) for the word is sounded as if it were written <i>alef vav</i> plus <i>zevulun</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Vav</i> is the sign of the <i>shuruk</i>. I.E. explains that a <i>shuruk</i> is sounded as if spelled <i>alef vav;</i> i.e., it is pronounced ooh.</i> However, if we deal with a word whose first letter is a <i>yod</i>, an example being the name <i>yehudah</i>, then the <i>yod</i> is silent, for the <i>yod</i> is one of the quiescent letters.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The quiescent letters are the <i>alef, heh, vav</i>, and <i>yod</i>. These letters surrender their consonantal function by coalescing with surrounding vowel signs at the end of a syllable or word. Thus the <i>yod</i> following a <i>chirik</i> or <i>tzere</i> is not sounded as a consonant. Hence the term quiescent letters.</i> Compare, <i>biyhudah</i> (against Judah) in <i>Let us go up against Judah</i> (Isaiah 7:6) and <i>kiyhudah</i> (like Judah) and <i>liyhudah</i> (of Judah) in <i>Of Judah, Nahshon</i> (Num. 1:7). In the latter case the <i>yod</i> is silent and is not perceived or felt when the word is enunciated. The same is also the case when a <i>vav</i> is prefixed to the word <i>yehudah</i>. The word is pronounced <i>viyhudah</i>.The tribes are here listed in order of their births.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the order in which they were born to their mothers. First Leah’s children are listed in the order of their birth. Then Rachel’s son Benjamin is listed. The children of the wives are followed by the children of the handmaids. The latter are also listed in the order that their mothers bore them. Joseph is listed last because he was in Egypt when the others arrived there (Krinsky).</i>"

                "ISSACHAR. Because the two <i>sins</i> in <i>yissachar</i> (Issachar) are written in succession only one is sounded. Compare, the word <i>machtzetzrim</i> (did blow) (I Chron. 15:24), which is pronounced <i>machtzerim</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word is spelled with two <i>tzadis</i> in succession. However, only one <i>tzadi</i> is sounded. Similarly, <i>yissachar</i> is pronounced <i>yisachar</i>.</i> We do not find a similar case with regard to the <i>sin</i> in Scripture.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is no other instance in Scripture where two <i>sins</i> are written in succession and only one is pronounced (Krinsky).</i> It is customary for the Hebrews to pronounce a <i>vav</i> prefixed to the labials which are related to the <i>vav</i>, namely, the <i>bet, mem, peh</i> with an <i>alef</i> added to it,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See note 24. The <i>vav</i> is a labial. Before a labial the <i>vav</i> is not pronounced like a labial but is pronounced “ooh” so as not to have two labials back to back.</i> and to vocalize the <i>vav</i> with a <i>shuruk</i>. Compare, <i>u-faru</i> (and they shall be fruitful) in <i>and they shall be fruitful and multiply</i> (Jeremiah 23:3); and <i>u-male’u</i> (shall be full) in <i>and the houses of the Egyptians shall he full of swarms of flies</i> (Ex. 8:17).

Thus <i>yehi</i> should have been vocalized <i>yihey</i>.</i> in <i>and the multitude of the burdens against him</i> (II Chron. 24:27).

However, because of the difficulty involved in the enunciation of the word in the aforementioned manner, the <i>yod</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, the last <i>yod</i>.</i> was silenced and we vocalized the <i>heh</i> with a <i>chirik</i>.

Since the Bible speaks of <i>a daughter</i> the latter form should have been used.</i> because the <i>heh</i> of the root<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">156</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In a root ending in a <i>heh</i>.</i> changes to a <i>tav</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">157</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the third person feminine perfect.</i> as it does in the construct in the case of the word <i>chayat</i> (beast of)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">158</sup><i class=\"footnote\">From the root <i>chet, yod, heh</i>.</i> in <i>and to every beast of the earth</i> (Gen. 1:30). The reason for the change is that the <i>heh</i> and the <i>tav</i> are similar in appearance when written. The only difference between them is the extension of the dot that is within the <i>heh</i>. For the letter <i>tav</i> is first a <i>heh</i>. It is only when the dot is extended that it becomes a <i>tav</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">159</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>heh</i> is open on the left side with the exception of a tiny line (referred to as a dot by I.E.) at the bottom. The <i>tav</i> is closed on both the right and left sides.

In the “Hebrew script” they are totally different. The fact that the Torah substitutes a <i>heh</i> for a <i>tav</i> because they resemble each other shows that the Torah was originally written in the Assyrian script. Historically speaking, the opinion that the Torah was given in “Hebrew script” is right, for all Hebrew writing extant from the period of the first commonwealth is in the “Hebrew script.”</i>Generally speaking, the root of the word <i>chai</i> (lived) and the root of the word <i>chayyim</i> (life) are in doubt, for the grammarians have concluded that the root of the word <i>chai</i> (lived) in <i>And Arpachshad lived</i> (Gen. 11:12) is <i>chet, yod, yod</i>.

This is proof that the word <i>chai</i> comes from a root ending in a <i>heh</i>. The fact that we do not find the root of <i>chai</i> conjugated in any of the above-mentioned forms is proof that it belongs to those verbs whose stems end in a <i>heh</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">168</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, its root is <i>chet, yod, heh</i>.

Proof that what I say is correct is the word <i>shalu</i> (secure) in <i>Wherefore are all they secure that deal treacherously</i> (Job 12:1). For the root of <i>shalu</i> is <i>shin, lamed, heh</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">175</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shalev</i> is the noun form of the verb <i>shalu</i>. Hence the root of <i>shalev</i> must be the same as the root of <i>shalu</i>.</i>I will now explain to you why a <i>vav</i> is never employed as a third letter of a root. The latter is so because the <i>vav</i> serves as a third person singular suffix, as in the words <i>avdo va-amato</i> (his man-servant nor his maid-servant) (Ex. 20:14). The <i>vav</i> also serves as the sign of the plural, as in <i>peru u-revu</i> (be fruitful and multiply) (Gen. 1:22). There are also superfluous <i>vavs</i>, as in <i>beno be’or</i> (the son of Beor) (Num. 24:3).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">176</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The usual form is <i>ben</i>. Hence the <i>vav</i> of <i>beno</i> is superfluous.</i> Now if the <i>vav</i> was also used as the final letter of a root it would be confused with one of the three types of <i>vavs</i> that we have just mentioned, namely, the <i>vav</i> indicating a third person singular suffix, the <i>vav</i> indicating a plural, and the superfluous <i>vav</i>; we could not then ascertain the meaning of the word.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">177</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We would not be able to tell whether the <i>vav</i> is a root letter or a suffix (Krinsky).</i> The same is also true of the <i>yod</i>. The <i>yod</i> cannot serve as the final letter of a stem because it is used as a first person singular suffix, as in the word <i>yadi</i> (my hand) (Gen. 42:37). It is also employed as a first person plural suffix, as in the word <i>yadai</i> (my hands) (Deut. 9:15). It is also the sign of the plural construct, as in <i>yede</i> (the hands of) in <i>The hands of women full of compassion</i> (Lamentations 4:10). It is used as the sign of the feminine imperative, as in <i>de’i and re’i</i> (know and consider) (I Sam. 25:17). It is used to indicate relationship, as in <i>ha-ivri o ha-ivriyah</i> (a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman) (Deut. 15:22). The <i>yod</i> is also used superfluously in verbs, as in <i>ha-magbihi</i> (that is enthroned) (Ps. 113:5) and in <i>le-hoshivi</i> (that He may set him) (Ps. 113:8).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">178</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The normal forms are <i>ha-magbi’ah</i> and <i>le-hoshiv</i>.

Krinsky and Netter attempt to explain it and in my opinion fail to do so. The reading of the Vatican manuscript appears to be correct, and the words <i>kemo she-hizkarnu</i> are most likely a gloss by a scribe who thought that “there is no doubt” refers to what I.E. said earlier namely, that Amram married his aunt.</i> Our sages similarly received a tradition that Puah<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One of the midwives (v. 15).</i> and Miriam are one and the same person.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sotah</i> 11b.</i> It is also written, <i>And his sister stood afar off</i> (v. 4).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Which shows that Miriam was older than Moses.</i>Now we know that the four hundred-year period<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gen. 15:13.</i> which ended in Israel’s redemption started with the day that Isaac was born, for Isaac alone is considered to be Abraham’s seed.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gen. 21:12.</i> Now Isaac was sixty years old when he begot Jacob,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gen. 25:26.</i> and Jacob was eighty-five years old when he begot Reuben,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jacob came to Egypt at the age of 130 (Gen. 47:9).

Jacob was thus 91 years older than Joseph. Joseph was six years younger than Reuben since Reuben was born in the eighth year of Jacob’s stay with Laban, and Joseph in the fourteenth year of that stay (See I.E. on Gen. 30:23 and the notes thereto).

I.E. will soon explain why the <i>nun</i> was dropped from <i>banat</i>, the Hebrew word for daughter being <i>bat</i>.</i> It is similar to <i>givirah</i> (lady) and <i>geveret</i> (lady) as well as to <i>atarah</i> (crown) and <i>ateret</i> (crown) in which we find both the construct and the absolute forms used in the absolute.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bat</i> is usually in the absolute.

So too, <i>bat</i> means both daughter and daughter of.</i> Compare, <i>ateret</i> (crown of) in <i>A crown of glory</i> (Prov. 4:7).

The question arises, why did Jochebed hide Moses for three months? Why not two or four or five months? These commentaries assume that the Egyptians knew when Jochebed conceived and that they would come to check on the sex of her child nine months later. Hence they assume that Moses was born six months after conception and his mother hid him for three months, i.e., until the time the Egyptians would come to check the birth and ascertain the sex of the child. Cf.

His point is that the longer a child spends in the womb the healthier it will be. Hence Moses, who was “good,” could not have been premature. It is interesting that I.E. does not consider the possibility of divine intervention in making Moses a perfect specimen though born prematurely.</i> One who knows the time of conception is able to ascertain the time of birth, and one who knows the time of birth can ascertain the time of conception. This was established by the ancients. I myself have tried it five times.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.E. might be referring to his personal life. If this is the case then we may conclude that he had fathered five children by the time he composed the long commentary on Exodus. See the introduction to Vol. 1 of this work. It is also possible that people consulted I.E. to make horoscopes for their children and that the reference is to the latter. In this case we, of course, have no hint as to how many children I.E. had.</i> For the degree and place of the moon and its constellation at the moment of conception is also the degree of the constellation that flowers at the moment of begetting The degree which flowers at the moment of impregnation will also be the degree at which the moon will be found at the time of birth.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A flowering constellation is one that is present at the moment of conception. The point is that the moon will be in the same place in the sky and will have the same constellation as its background at birth as it did at conception.

Rachel then gave Bilhah to Jacob, and Bilhah bore Dan. And so on with the rest of the sons of Jacob. I.E. says that the latter is not necessarily the case. It is possible that Bilhah was given to Jacob when Simeon was born and that Scripture does not note this earlier because it wanted to record that Leah had four sons before she “left off bearing.” See I.E.’s comments on Gen. 30:23 and the notes thereto.</i> We find many such instances in the Torah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">67</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There are many instances in Scripture where what happened later is listed first and what happened earlier is listed later.</i> It is therefore possible that Rachel gave her handmaid to Jacob when Simeon was born, that Issachar was born before Asher,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Gen. 30:13 Asher’s birth is recorded before that of Issaschar (Gen. 30:18).</i> and that Dinah was Zebulun’s twin.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\">After recording that Leah gave birth to Zebulun, Genesis tells us, <i>And afterwards she bore a daughter, and called her name Dinah</i> (Gen. 30:21). <i>Prima facie</i>, it appears that Dinah was born some time after the birth of Zebulun. I.E. argues that this is not so. He suggests that <i>afterwards</i> means a few moments later, as it does in Gen. 30:21.</i> Hence the phrase <i>and afterwards</i> in <i>and afterwards she bore a daughter</i> (Gen. 30:21) is similar to <i>And after that came forth his brother</i> (Gen. 25:26). For <i>and she conceived</i> is not mentioned for each one. Also, <i>And it came to pass, when the seasons were come about</i> (I Sam. 1:20) refers to three seasons.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reference is to the birth of the prophet Samuel. According to the Talmudic sage Mar Zutra, Samuel was born six months and two days after he was conceived. The Bible tells us that Hannah, Samuel’s mother, prayed for a son and that “<i>seasons</i> (tekufat) <i>of days came to pass, and Hannah conceived and bore a son</i> (I Sam. 20). Mar Zutra explains that <i>tekufot</i> (seasons) refers to six months (a <i>tekufah</i>, a season is three months) and days, to two days. Cf. <i>Rosh Ha-Shanah</i> 11a. I.E. disagrees. According to him, <i>seasons</i> refers to three seasons (nine months). Hence Samuel was not born prematurely.</i>"

For example, <i>chakham</i> (wise) becomes <i>chakhamim</i> (wise). However, we do not have a plural form for the proper name <i>avraham</i> (Abraham). Thus we do not say <i>avrahamim</i> (Abrahams). Neither is there a plural for the proper name <i>yisra’el</i> (Israel). Thus if there are two people named Israel in a place we do not say <i>yisra’elim</i> (Israels). We would only use the term <i>yisra’elim</i> if we wanted to relate each of them to the people of Israel, as the term Israel is the name of a group.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">127</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Israel (<i>yisra’el</i>) is both the name of a person and the name of a nation. If we want to say that an individual is an Israelite we use the term <i>yisra’eli</i>. If we want to say that two or more people are Israelites we use the term <i>yisra’elim</i> (Israelites). However, if there are two people named Israel in a place, we do not say there are two Israels there (which is proper in English), because the name of individuals does not come in the plural.</i> The third difference is that a definite article is not prefixed to a proper noun as it is to an adjective. From the word <i>chakham</i> (wise) we get <i>he-chakham</i> (the wise man) (Eccles. 2:14).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">128</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, the word <i>chakham</i> can be written with the definite article (<i>he-chakham</i>).</i> However, it is incorrect to say <i>ha-avraham</i> (the Abraham) or <i>ha-yitzchak</i> (the Isaac). The word <i>ha-kohelet</i> (Eccles. 12:8)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">129</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Prima facie, kohelet</i> is a proper name.

Yet this proper noun has a definite article before it (<i>ha-adam</i>).</i> is an adjective.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">132</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, it is not a personal name.</i> It has a secret meaning to it, as it is the name of a genus.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">133</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It refers to all of mankind. See I.E. on Gen. 2:8 and the notes thereto.</i> The name <i>ha-menasheh</i> (Deut. 3:13)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">134</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Menashah</i> (Manasseh) is a proper noun.

Hence Manasseh in this verse is a common rather than a proper noun.</i> The fourth difference is that a proper noun has no construct form whereas an adjective does. For example, we find, <i>chakham lev</i> (wise of heart) (Job 9:4). However, it would be incorrect to say <i>yitzchak ha-dor</i> (Isaac of the generation), because a proper name stands by itself.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">136</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It does not have a construct form.</i> The same is the case with the name <i>Eheyeh</i> (I am) and also with the glorious name of God, the Tetragrammaton, because both of these names are proper names.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">137</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hence they do not come in the construct.</i> Now, we do find, <i>Adonai tzeva’ot</i> (the Lord of hosts) (Is. 1:9),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">138</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Wherein <i>Adonai</i> is apparently in the construct.</i> and as a result many were forced to conclude that <i>tzeva’ot</i> is a proper name<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">139</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, a proper name of God.

Hence it cannot be a personal name. For the same reason, <i>Adonai tzeva’ot</i> cannot be interpreted to mean the Lord is outstanding among His hosts.</i> <i>Tzeva’ot</i> is never encountered by itself. It is always connected either to the word <i>Elohim</i> (God) or to God’s glorious name, <i>Adonai</i> (<i>Elohim</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">143</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The text has <i>Adonai Elohim</i>. However, this appears to be a scribal error, for I.E. goes on to say, “Do not be bothered by the phrase <i>Adonai Elohim tzeva’ot</i>.” Why should the latter present any problem to I.E.’s assertion that the name <i>tzeva’ot</i> is only found connected to <i>Adonai</i> or <i>Adonai Elohim</i> when in this case it is connected to <i>Adonai Elohim</i>? Furthermore, I.E. limits the use of the term “the glorious name of God” to <i>Adonai</i>. He does not use it in reference to <i>Adonai Elohim</i>. Hence we should read, “or to God’s glorious name, <i>Adonai</i>,” and omit the word <i>Elohim</i> (Krinsky).</i> Do not be bothered by the phrase <i>Adonai Elohim tzeva’ot</i> (O Lord God of hosts) (Ps. 59:6),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">144</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Where <i>tzeva’ot</i> is connected to <i>Adonai Elohim</i> (Krinsky) or where <i>tzeva’ot</i> seems to be a personal name, for the verse appears to read, “0 Lord God, Hosts.”</i> as its meaning is similar to <i>ve-ha-nevu’ah oded ha-navi</i> (even the prophecy of Oded the prophet) (II Chron. 15:8).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">145</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For grammatical reasons this verse has to be read as if written: <i>ve-hanevu’ah nevu’at oded ha-navi</i>.

Our phrase is thus to be read: <i>Adonai Elohim Elohe ha-tzeva’ot</i>.</i> ",
                "Now the Lord’s personal name is sometimes used in an adjectival sense because God alone exists forever and the existence of all things is contingent upon Him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">146</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.E. will soon note that when the name Lord is used as an adjective it means the maintainer of the universe.</i> God’s proper name is used here in the same way that the name <i>moshe</i> (Moses) is used in <i>Then He remembered the days of old, when He drew</i> (moshe) <i>His people</i> (Is. 63:11).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">147</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.E.’s rendering of this verse (Krinsky).

Hence in the phrase <i>Adonai Elohim</i> the holy angels are connected to God.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">148</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Elohim</i> means the angels (see I.E. on Gen 1:1). In the phrase <i>Adonai Elohim, Adonai</i> is in the construct with <i>Elohim</i>. Thus the meaning of the phrase is: Lord of the angels. Here <i>Adonai</i> is an “adjective,” as it is in the construct.

                "Note that the number one is the secret and the foundation of all numbers,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">159</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.E. now goes on to give a mystical explanation of God’s name based on numerology. God’s personal name is written <i>YHVH</i> (<i>yod, heh, vav, heh</i>) or <i>EHYH</i> (<i>alef, heh, yod, heh</i>). Thus God’s name is written with the letters <i>alef</i> (numerically equal to 1), <i>heh</i> (5), <i>vav</i> (6), and <i>yod</i> (10).</i> and that two is the first of the even numbers and three the first of the odd numbers. Now from one point of view there are only nine numbers.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">160</sup><i class=\"footnote\">1 through 9. For the number 10 is like the number 1.

Now in the numbers 81, 72, 63, and 54 the ten number is on the right and the one number on the left.</i> Now when we come to the number five which is in the middle, we find the reverse; i.e., the tens become ones and the ones become tens.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">167</sup><i class=\"footnote\">After number 5 the numbers reverse themselves, i.e., 54 to 45 (9x5), 63 to 36 (9x4), 72 to 27 (9x3), and 81 to 18 (9x2). Thus what was originally a ten number becomes a one number and what was a one number becomes a ten number. The number that was on the left goes to the right and the number on the right goes to the left.</i> However, looked upon from another perspective, there are ten numbers<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">168</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Up to this point I.E. explains the argument for only 9 numbers.

Similarly, thirty is like three and all the tens till ninety are like the nine ones. When the number one hundred is reached we once again come upon a number which is similar to one. When we reach nine hundred we once again have nine numbers similar to the nine ones.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">174</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, 100 through 900 corresponds to 1 through 9.</i> This is so until we reach the number one thousand which consists of ten hundreds.

There are two for the sun and the moon; five for the planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn; one for the zodiac and one for the diurnal sphere. The highest of all is the throne of glory, which also comprises all of the spheres and actuates them. The heavenly bodies receive their various properties from the tenth sphere (Lev. 27:32), the realm of holiness from which the natural forces emanate (E. Levine, Introduction to <i>Vat. Ebr.</i> 38, p. 11).</i> The tenth sphere, which is holy, is so called<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">186</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is called <i>kodesh</i> (holy).</i> because its power is manifest throughout the throne of glory.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">187</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The heavens.</i> It is the most powerful sphere and circles all the bodies.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">188</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The heavenly bodies.

See notes 166 and 167 and the text to which they pertain.</i> Now the numbers <i>alef</i> (1), <i>heh</i> (5), <i>vav</i> (6), and <i>yod</i> (10) are the most glorious numerals.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">190</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The letters/numbers of the divine name <i>EHYH</i> and <i>YHVH</i>.

He points out that numbers that end in one, have one in their square. Other numbers, with the exception of 5, 6, and 10, do not have this quality.</i> The same is true with its counterpart.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">192</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, its cube. A cubed number that ends in one has one in its root; e.g., 1,331 is the cube of 11. I.E. refers to a cube as the counterpart of a square because a square is formed by multiplying a number by itself, while a cube is formed by multiplying a number by itself three times.</i> Similarly, the number five will be found in the square of five<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">193</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, in the number 25. The same holds for the cube of 5.</i> and the number six will be found in the square of six.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">194</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, in the number 36. The same holds for the cube of 6.</i> These four numbers always maintain their identity when squared;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">195</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The 1 (<i>alef</i>), 5 (<i>heh</i>), 6(<i>vav</i>), and 10 (<i>yod</i>) are not lost when squared as other numbers are. For example, the number 2 is not seen in 4. However, 5 maintains its identity in its square, 25. So too with the numbers 1, 6, and 10.</i> therein lies their superiority over all other numbers that are squared. Additionally, every number is potentially present in the number one.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">196</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Any number imaginable is made up of ones.</i> Similarly, the number one is found in all the actual numbers.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">197</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Every existing number consists of a number of ones.</i> Furthermore, the number one accomplishes on one side what the other numbers accomplish in two sides.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">198</sup><i class=\"footnote\">All the numbers have two sides, i.e., a preceding number and a following number. For example, the number 5 is preceded by 4 and followed by 6. However, the number one has no preceding number. All numbers are half the sum of the preceding and following numbers; e.g., 2 is half the sum of 1 and 3, 5 is half the sum of 4 and 6, and 6 is half the sum of 5 and 7. One is half the sum of 2, without having a preceding number. Hence the number one accomplishes with one side what the others need two sides to accomplish.</i> Now behold the power of the number one. If you add its square to the square of its double you get five,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">199</sup><i class=\"footnote\">1 squared + 2 squared=5.</i> a number whose cube equals its squares, for if you add its square<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">200</sup><i class=\"footnote\">5 squared=25.</i> to the square of its double<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">201</sup><i class=\"footnote\">(5x2) squared=100.</i> it will equal its cube.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">202</sup><i class=\"footnote\">125. In other words, 5 cubed (125) = 5 squared (25) + 10 squared (100).</i> In all the numbers preceding five<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">203</sup><i class=\"footnote\">With the exception of one, whose uniqueness I.E. has just pointed out.</i> the relationship of the cube to the sum of the two squared numbers will be the same as the relationship of that number to five.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">204</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For example, the relationship of 4 cubed (64) to 4 squared + 8 squared (80) is 4:5. The relationship of 3 cubed (27) to 3 squared + 6 squared (45) is 3:5. The relationship of 2 cubed (8) to 2 squared + 4 squared (20) is 2:5.</i> The reverse is the case with the numbers above five.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">205</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above 5 the relationship of a number cubed to the sum of its square changes. Above 5 the cube is higher than the sum of its squared numbers whereas below 5 it is lower than the sum of its squares (see note 204). For example, 6 cubed is 216, 6 squared is 36, and 12 squared is 144; 36+144= 180. The relationship between 216 and 180 is 6:5. We thus see the following: below 5 the cube of a number is less than the sum of that number squared plus the square of its double. At 5 the cube is equal to the number squared then doubled and squared. Above 5 the cube is greater by the ratio of that number to 5 than the number squared then doubled and squared. Hence 5 is a very special number.</i> The number six<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">206</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.E. now goes on to explain the significance of the letter <i>vav</i> (numerically equivalent to 6) of God’s name.</i> is equal to its parts.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">207</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The number 6 is equal to all the numbers by which it can be evenly divided, i.e., 1, 2, and 3; l+2+3=6. Hence 6 equals its parts.</i> There is no other number in the order of the integers that equals its parts aside from this number. When<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">208</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.E. now goes on to explain the significance of the letter <i>yod</i> (numerically equivalent to 10) of God’s name.</i> the square of one is added to the square of the first of the odd numbers<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">209</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The number 3.</i> we get ten.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">210</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, the result equals the similar number. I.E. calls the number 10 the similar number because 10 is similar to 1. See note 173.</i> Now if we bisect a circle with a line that is ten units long<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">211</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, the circle is 10 units in diameter.</i> and a line is drawn across the circle a third of the way up, a triangle two of whose sides are equal may be drawn.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">212</sup><i class=\"footnote\">An isosceles triangle may be drawn.<br><img></i> The number representing the area of this triangle will equal the circumference of the circle.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">213</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Line AB is 10 units long. Line CD is a third of the way up. Lines AC and AD are equal. Triangle ACD is equal to the circumference of the circle. According to I.E. this shows the excellence of the number 10. Of course, one is area and the other linear, but the number, 31.4, is the same. However, it should be pointed out that they are not exactly equal, as we can see if we carry out the calculations; the circumference is equal to 31.4159 while the triangle’s area is equal to 31.4269.</i> Similarly the rectangle<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">214</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, the long square.</i> formed in the circle.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">215</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If another line is drawn a third of the way down along the line bisecting the circle and its points connected, a rectangle is formed.

The reverse is true in cases where the triangle is greater than 10; i.e., the area is greater than the circumference. The basic error involved in the text discussed in note 213 and this note i s that I.E. assumes that two quantities, one involved in circumference and one involved in area, are equal, when in fact they are not, although they are very close.</i> ",

He had similarly used the <i>vav</i>, which happens to be a very important and easily sounded labial. Now there are no root letters more easily pronounceable than the palatals.

The forms of the latter change while that of the former never do. However, I.E. speaks of movements, not of forms.

The person will then cleave to God the glorious. This is precisely what Jacob meant when he vowed, <i>then shall the Lord be my God</i> (Gen. 28:21). Jacob vowed that he would dedicate his entire life to cleave unto God to the fullest of his might. Jacob therefore said, <i>Put away the strange gods that are among you</i> (Gen. 35:2).

The stars appear to be moving nightly from east to west. See W. M. Feldman, <i>Rabbinical Mathematics and Astronomy</i>, Hermon Press, p. 65.</i> the sun and the moon move from west to east. The sun and the moon would next be in conjunction at the end of twenty-nine and a half days, two-thirds and seventy-three parts of an hour, according to the way Israelites divide the hour.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Israelites divide the hour into 1,080 parts.</i> Thus<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Before the moon is in conjunction with the sun again.</i> the moon would have traveled the very degrees that the sun journeyed,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">27 degrees.

Now let us assume the sun to be at the beginning of Aries. It will then travel three hundred and sixty-five days plus close to a quarter of a day in its sphere until it returns a second time to where it started out. It is for this reason that a year is called a <i>shanah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The root <i>shin, nun, heh</i> means once again.

Nothing new happens to the sun; only to the light of the moon does something new occur.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew term for a month is <i>chodesh</i>. It comes from the root <i>chet, dalet, shin</i> meaning new.

All the other months are similarly written.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They are referred to by number in Scripture, the count of the months starting from the month in which spring falls.</i> Nisan, Iyyar, Sivan, and all the other names of the months are not Hebrew.

We therefore do not encounter these terms in any book of Scripture except in the Scroll of Esther and in the prophecies of Zechariah, Daniel,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The names of the months are not found in Daniel.

This then is its<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The allusion is to Esth. 3:7, which reads: “In the first month, which is the month of Nisan.” This verse presented a problem to I.E. as it implies that Nisan is the real or Hebrew name of the first month, hence his comment.</i> meaning: in the first month, which is called Nisan in the Chaldean tongue.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, Nisan is not its Hebrew name.</i> However, we find three months called by other names in Hebrew, viz., <i>in the month Ziv</i> (I Kings 6:1); <i>in the month Ethanim</i> (I Kings 8:2); <i>in the month Bul</i> (I Kings 6:7). If we pursue the literal meaning of the text the month of Ziv is not Nisan but Iyyar, for it is written, <i>in the month Ziv, which is the second month</i> (I Kings 6:1), that is, which is known as the second to the first of the months of Israel. The words <i>of Solomon’s reign</i> (<i>Ibid</i>.) are not connected to the word <i>month</i> but rather to <i>the fourth year of Solomon’s reign</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Kings 6:1 literally reads: <i>And it came to pass…in the fourth year, in the month Ziv, which is the second month of Solomon’s reign over Israel</i>. At first glance it appears <i>which is the second month</i> is connected to <i>of Solomon’s reign</i>. We thus have no proof that Ziv is the second month. Hence I.E. says that <i>of Solomon’s reign</i> refers to <i>in the fourth year</i>, and the verse is to be understood as follows: And it came to pass…in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month Ziv, which is the second month. J.P.S. translates accordingly.</i> as we do not find the months related in the account of any king.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When the year of a king’s reign, is given, months are omitted.</i> Scripture only reports the year that the king started his reign. <i>In the second day</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">So <i>Vat.

Thus, as I.E. goes on to explain, while it may be spring according to the solar calendar it may not be spring climatically. Thus, contrary to the Pentateuch, Passover will not always be a spring festival.</i> The years differ,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">From each other with regard to climate.</i> due to the effect of the planets, in that the rain increases or diminishes and the heat or cold increases or diminishes each month,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">64</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, climatically speaking it will still be winter although it is astronomically spring.</i> making it different from the known norm.

I will now give you a general rule. Although the Israelites in the time of the Holy Temple watched for the arrival of spring,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Before celebrating Passover.</i> the establishment of a leap year was not in their hands. It rather depended on the Bet Din which, as is related in the Mishnah,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Really in the <i>Tosefta</i>. Cf. <i>Tosefta, Sanhedrin</i> 2:2.</i> looked for other things besides spring.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">72</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See I.E.’s Introduction to Vol. 1, p. 9. Also see <i>Sanhedrin</i>. 11b and <i>M.T., New Moon</i> 5:2, where Maimonides writes, “Intercalation of the year depended upon the following three criteria, the <i>tekufah</i>, the barley harvest, and the blooming of the tree fruits.”</i> Now Moses did not explain to us in the Torah how we should establish years or months. Neither did he tell us what we should do if we do not find it to be spring. One can pose a difficult question from all this, namely, why did Moses explain the laws of the plagues of the leper, which fall upon one person and do not last forever,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">73</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lev. 13 and 14.</i> and leave out of the Torah the laws of the festivals<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">74</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The laws dealing with the establishment of the months wherein the festivals fall. I.E. makes the same point in his Introduction to Vol. 1, p. 4: “Nowhere in the Torah do we find clearly stated the rules governing the establishment of years nor how to calculate months.”</i> that all of Israel is obligated to keep at all times? Furthermore, eating leaven on Passover and eating on the Day of Atonement are punished with excision. If Moses relied on the conjunction of the moon and sun he should have explained whether he meant according to the moon’s mean motion<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">75</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, the mean conjunction. “The moment that the moon would have the same longitude as the sun, if both moved uniformly (Feldman, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 123; <i>M.T., New Moon</i> 6:1).</i> or its true conjunction,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">76</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“The exact moment at which the centers of the sun and moon actually have precisely the same longitude” (Feldman, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 122).</i> which takes place opposite the sphere of the constellations, because at times there are approximately fourteen hours between the calculated conjunction<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">77</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The mean conjunction.</i> and the true conjunction. It is because of this that our holy fathers said, “At times it<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">78</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The true conjunction.</i> comes at longer intervals; at times it<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">79</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The true conjunction.</i> comes at shorter intervals.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">80</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Rosh Ha-Shanah</i> 25a.</i> Only one who knows his way in the science of astronomy can know this. Additionally, Moses should have explained from which part of the earth we reckon the conjunction. For behold, between Jerusalem and this city, whose name is Lucca, there is more than three hours.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">81</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the time of sunrise (Krinsky, Weiser). Hence also in the time of the conjunction. However, in Gen. 23:10 Ibn Ezra says there is a difference of one and a third hours between Lucca and Jerusalem.</i> If Moses relied on the time the moon is first seen<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">82</sup><i class=\"footnote\">By the naked eye, for the establishment of the new moon.</i> he should have explained the place of its sighting,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">83</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The place where the moon is to be seen first in order for a new month to be declared.</i> as the Arc of Vision<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">84</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“The difference in altitudes between the sun and the moon” (Feldman, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 160). Cf. <i>M.T.

All of these things require lengthy exposition. Now if it is cloudy, shall we out of doubt observe the new moon for two days?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">85</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On the two days that the moon might possibly be seen, i.e., on the 30th and 31st days from the last new moon.</i> This proves that the establishment of the new moon is contingent on the declaration of the Bet Din in each generation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">86</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Similarly in I.E.’s Introduction to Vol. 1, p. 9.</i> They had a tradition that the Bet Din establish seven leap years every nineteen years, totaling two hundred and thirty-five months or six thousand, nine hundred and thirty-nine and two-thirds days, plus five hundred and ninety-five parts of an hour. The aforementioned are nineteen solar years without addition or subtraction. Do not concern yourself with the hour and four hundred and eighty-five parts of an hour<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">87</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Which are left in balance every 19 years.</i> according to “Samuel’s calendar.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">88</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hebrew, <i>Tekufat Shemu’el</i>. Literally, Samuel’s circuit or Samuel’s season. Cf. <i>M.T., New Moon</i> 9:12: “As to the solar year there are certain Jewish sages (viz., Samuel) who have held that it consists of 365 days and one quarter of a day, which is six hours.” According to the latter opinion, “There remains in each cycle of 19 solar years a balance of 1 hour and 485 parts.”</i> We know that this was not hidden from him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">89</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Samuel was aware of the imbalance.</i> Samuel only used a number which was close in his time to the men of his generation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">90</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Samuel employed a number which, while not a hundred percent accurate was close enough for the purposes of his time.</i> Today there is a difference of close to nine days<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">91</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The imbalance every 19 years between the real cycle and Samuel’s cycle has resulted in this much time accumulating from Samuel’s era to that of I.E.</i> between the true circuit<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">92</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Of the sun.</i> and Samuel’s circuit. Do not be amazed at this. For behold the <i>Braita</i> states<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">93</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Samuel’s <i>Braita</i> (Weiser). It is not in our editions of the Talmud. However, a manuscript of it was found and published by Aryeh Leib Lipkin in Pietrokov in 1901 (Krinsky). On the other hand, the <i>Braita</i> referred to by I.E. might be an anonymous source. I.E. merely employs it to illustrate his point that the 73 parts of an hour were not always given when the days and hours of the month were discussed.</i> that one who wants to know the place of the moon should calculate the year of the world and divide it into months and divide the months into twenty-nine and a half days and two-thirds of an hour, i.e., seven hundred and twenty parts of an hour.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">94</sup><i class=\"footnote\">An hour consists of 1,080 parts. 720=2/3 of 1,080.</i> Now seventy-three parts are missing.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">95</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.E. earlier noted that a month consists of 29 and a half days plus two-thirds of an hour and 73 parts of an hour. However, according to Samuel’s <i>Braita</i> it consists of 29 and a half days and two-thirds of an hour.</i> They will add up to more than two-thirds of a day each cycle.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Of 19 years. The calculations are as follows: 73x12=876. 876x19=16,644. Each day contains 28,320 parts of an hour (24 x 1,080).</i> There will thus be<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">97</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to Samuel’s calendar (Weiser).</i> a difference of close to half a year between the calculation of the conjunctions from creation and our own calculation of the conjunction.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">98</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The author of the <i>Braita</i> (or Samuel, if he was the author) must have been aware of this discrepancy. However, he employed a number which, while not a hundred percent accurate, was close enough for his purposes.</i> It has thus been made clear to you that the sum of our years equals out every cycle of solar years, and our months are always lunar months.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">99</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, that the Jews coordinate the solar and lunar years by intercalating 7 leap years every 19 years.</i> Blessed be the Lord who has guided me in the straight path. I will now offer you proof from Scripture that the festivals are dependent upon the Bet Din. Scripture states, <i>For the king</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">100</sup><i class=\"footnote\">King Hezekiah.</i><i>had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month</i> (II Chron. 30:2). Now if they had a tradition to look for spring,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">101</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, only for spring and not for the declaration of the Bet Din as to whether the first month had arrived or not</i> as those who argue with our rabbis of blessed memory claim, why did the king take counsel to establish the Passover in the second month?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">102</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He should have kept Passover in the first month, the month when spring fell.</i> It will now be shown if their<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">103</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Those who disagree with the sages.</i> words are true. Hezekiah did three evils.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">104</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If we accept the theory of those who disagree with our sages.</i> First of all, he did not offer the Passover sacrifice in its time<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">105</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the first month.</i> although he was ritually clean.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">106</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Those who are ritually unclean bring the Passover offering in the second month. See Num. 9:1-8.</i> Why did Hezekiah delay the observance of Passover because most of the congregation had not arrived?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">107</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Jerusalem.</i> Such a thing is only found in the words of tradition,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">108</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to the Talmud the Bet Din may insert an additional Adar and thus celebrate Passover a month later if for some reason the congregation cannot make it to Jerusalem by the 15th of Nisan.</i> not in Scripture.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">109</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nowhere in the Pentateuch is it stated that the observance of Passover may be delayed because most of the congregation has not arrived in Jerusalem.</i> Second, he ate and caused Israel to eat leaven in the first month.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">110</sup><i class=\"footnote\">By ordering Israel to keep Passover in the second month.</i> Third, on his own<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">111</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Contrary to the Torah, which ordains the observance of Passover in the first month.</i> he decided to observe the festival of unleavened bread in the second month. Such a thing is not to be done. With the exception of eating the paschal lamb<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">112</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Of those who are unclean during Passover. See note 106.</i> on one night,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">113</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The night of the 15th of Iyyar.</i> the Lord did not command the observance of the Passover in the second month, for all those who are unclean eat unleavened bread along with all of Israel in the first month. Far be it for Hezekiah to do such evil. Moreover, Scripture says of him that he did not turn aside to the right or left from the commandments of the Lord.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">114</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Chron. 18:6. Therefore he did not commit any of the above evils.</i> Furthermore, Hezekiah himself said in his prayer, <i>Remember now, O Lord, I beseech Thee, how I have walked before Thee…and have done that which is good in Thy sight</i> (II Kings 20:3). I will now explain.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">115</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Why and what Hezekiah did.</i> Know that Hezekiah took counsel with the entire congregation<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">116</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Of Jerusalem. Cf. II Chron. 30:2.</i> at the start of the first month that they should observe the Passover in the following month because most of the people had not arrived and the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient numbers.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">117</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Chron. 30:3.</i> He thus added a month to the year, and the Passover that he observed was the actual Passover<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">118</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As opposed to the second Passover observed one month later for those who were impure. See note 106.</i> in its proper season. The fact that God plagued those who ate the paschal lamb in a manner contrary to what is written<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">119</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, in a state of impurity. See II Chron. 30:18</i> is proof of this. If the Passover observed by Hezekiah was not celebrated in its proper time and was therefore not acceptable to the Lord,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">120</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, God did not consider it a proper Passover offering.</i> why did He plague them?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">121</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For eating the paschal lamb in a state of impurity.</i> If Hezekiah sinned how is it that he prayed on their behalf<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">122</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On behalf of those who ate the paschal lamb in a state of impurity.</i> and the Lord accepted his supplication and healed the people?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">123</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See II Chron. 30:20.</i> The answer to one who would argue that the sages of blessed memory did not maintain<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">124</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, admit.</i> that Hezekiah acted properly in adding another month during the month of Nisan<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">125</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The rabbis claim that Hezekiah acted improperly in calling Nisan Adar II after Nisan had already started. Cf. <i>Pesachim</i> 56a.</i> is: they<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">126</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The sages.</i> spoke the truth. It is the custom of every Bet Din to ascertain at the end of the month of Adar whether it is necessary<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">127</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For climatic or other reasons.</i> to add another month to the year or not. Now Hezekiah did not do this; he committed a small error in adding another month to the year at the beginning of the month.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">128</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Of Nisan.</i> Now since the additional month<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">129</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Adar II.</i> always comes before the first month,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">130</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nisan.</i> the latter is always the first of the months, and the festivals<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">131</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, Rosh Ha-Shanah, Yom Kippur, and Sukkot. Cf. Lev. 23:23-44.</i> will fall in the seventh month from it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">132</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, the adding of the extra month does not affect the numbering of the months. Nisan is always the first month. Iyyar the second, Sivan the third, and so on.</i> This is the meaning of <i>it shall be the first month of the year to you</i> (v. 2).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">133</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The counting of the months must begin with Nisan.</i> We know that many commandments are in memory of the Exodus from Egypt. Behold, it is therefore fitting that the Exodus be the first reference point in Israel’s calculations. Thus it is written, <i>And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year…in the month Ziv, which is the second month</i> (I Kings 6:1). The gentiles ask, if the year is made up of months and the month of spring is its foundation and beginning, why do you calculate your years from the seventh month and say that a new year begins on its first day?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">134</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words they argue that the new year, Rosh Ha-Shanah, should begin in Nisan, the first month. It should be noted that the Torah does not explicitly refer to the first of Tishri as new year’s day.</i> The answer is that our sages of blessed memory have already noted<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">135</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In tractate <i>Rosh Ha-Shanah</i> 2a.</i> that there are four new year days.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">136</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Each one of which serves a distinct purpose. The first of Nisan is the new year for festivals and kings. The first of Tishri is for the reckoning of years, of the year of release (<i>shimitah</i>) and the jubilee year. The first of Elul is the new year of the tithe of cattle, and the first of Shebat is for trees (so Beth Shammai, whereas Beth Hillel places it on the 15th of Shebat).</i> We clearly see that the sanctification of the jubilee year is <i>on the tenth day of the seventh month</i> (Lev. 25:9).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">137</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Which shows that the counting of the jubilee year starts in Tishri, not in Nisan.</i> Furthermore, God commanded that the Torah be read <i>in the set time of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles</i> (Deut. 31:10)…<i>that they may hear, and that they may learn</i> (Deut. 31:12). Now if the beginning of the year of release is reckoned from Nisan, why didn’t God command that the Torah be read during the festival of unleavened bread? Now they were idle for half a year.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">138</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, half of the year of release, when one is prohibited from working the ground, would have passed by the time Sukkot arrived. The Torah connects the reading of the Torah with the year of release. If the year of release starts in Tishri then we can understand why the Torah is read in Tishri. However, if the new year starts in Nisan it makes no sense to read the Torah six months later.</i> Furthermore, Scripture states, <i>and the feast of ingathering</i> <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">139</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reference is to the festival of Sukkot.</i> <i>at the turn of the year</i> (Ex. 34:22). <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">140</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We thus see that Sukkot falls in the month at which the year turns, that is, begins. This proves that Tishri is the start of a new year.</i> Elsewhere it states,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">141</sup><i class=\"footnote\">With reference to the festival of Sukkot.</i> <i>at the end of the year</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">142</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, in the month which marks the end of the old and the beginning of a new year. We thus have additional proof that the new year begins in Tishri.</i> <i>when thou gatherest in thy labors out of the field</i> (Ex. 23:16). Additionally, we can derive the aforementioned<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">143</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That the year of release begins in Tishri.</i> from the way the Torah speaks and from the way nature acts. The Torah first states,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">144</sup><i class=\"footnote\">With regard to the sabbatical year.</i> <i>ye shall not sow</i> and afterwards says, <i>neither</i> (shall ye) <i>reap</i> (Lev. 25:12). The season of sowing is close to Tishri,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">145</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When the year of release begins.</i> not Nisan. Furthermore, if we reckon the beginning of the year of release from Nisan he who sowed in the sixth year<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">146</sup><i class=\"footnote\">After Tishri.</i> will not harvest in the seventh year, because the harvest falls after Nisan when the year of release has already started.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">147</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hence he will not sow in the sixth year.</i> He will also not sow in the year of release.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">148</sup><i class=\"footnote\">After Tishri. There will thus be two rather than one year of no sowing. However, Scripture only speaks of one year of no sowing.</i> We thus see that the words of our sages are correct.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">149</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That the year of release and similarly the years in general start in Tishri.</i>",
                "THE BEGINNING OF MONTHS. Rabbi Moses Ha-Kohen<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">150</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See I.E. on Ex. 2:2 and the notes thereto.</i> says that there is no need to use the term <i>rosh chodesh</i> (new moon). The term <i>chodesh</i> suffices,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">151</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, <i>chodesh</i> means the first day of the month. It does not mean month. Such terms as <i>esrim la-chodesh</i>, usually translated as the 20th of the month, really mean 20 days from the new moon.</i> since the meaning of <i>chodesh</i> is the day that the light of the moon is renewed. Scripture thus states, <i>chodesh ve-shabbat</i> (New moon and sabbath) (Is. 1:13); <i>chodshekhem u-mo’adekhem</i> (your new moons and your appointed seasons) (Is. 1:14); <i>mi-de chodesh be-chodsho</i> (from one new moon to another) (Is. 66:23).

We thus see that the terms <i>ben shanah</i> and <i>ben shenato</i> are one and the same. Therefore Rabbi Joshua is incorrect. I might add that both Krinsky and Weiser missed I.E.’s point. Both indicate that I.E.’s proof is from the five he-lambs of the first year (<i>bene shanah</i>) brought as peace offerings.

                "AT DUSK. <i>Ben ha-arbayim</i> (at dusk) is a difficult phrase. Rabbi Solomon<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">196</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi. Rashi writes on Ex. 12:6 that from six hours (noon) and upwards is termed <i>ben ha-arbayim</i>.</i> says that it refers to the moment after midday that the sun moves to the west. He does not explain why <i>arbayim</i> is in the dual form.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">197</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Actually Rashi does explain. He writes, “It appears to me that the term <i>ben ha-arbayim</i> refers to those hours between the darkening of the day (<i>arivat ha-yom</i>, i.e., when the sun begins its descent) and the darkening of the night (<i>arivat ha-laylah</i>, i.e., when night starts). The day darkens at the start of the seventh hour…and the night begins to darken at the beginning of the night.” Hence according to Rashi, <i>ben ha-arbayim</i> means between the two evenings (or darkenings). I.E. probably quoted from memory. I doubt that I.E.’s manuscript of Rashi differed from ours.</i> Now, Scripture states, <i>And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at dusk</i> (ben ha-arbayim) (Ex. 30:8), and there is no doubt that Aaron is to light the lamps when the sun sets.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">198</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ex. 27:21. We thus see, contra Rashi, that <i>ben arbayim</i> does not refer to a moment after midday.</i> Now, when we researched this phrase we found that Scripture refers to the moment of <i>ben ha-arbayim</i> as <i>erev</i> (evening).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">199</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.E. explains later on.</i> For it is clearly written, <i>At dusk</i> (ben ha-arbayim) <i>ye shall eat flesh</i> (Ex. 16:12), and it is there stated, <i>when the Lord shall give you in the evening</i> (ba-erev) <i>flesh to eat</i> (Ex. 16:8). Likewise, concerning the lighting of the lamps it is written: <i>Aaron and his sons shall set it in order, to burn from evening</i> (erev) <i>to morning before the Lord</i> (Ex. 27:21).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">200</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This verse proves that <i>erev</i> means the same as <i>ben ha-arbayim</i>, as this verse is parallel to Ex. 30:8.</i> It is similarly written, <i>even burnt-offerings mornings and evening</i> (erev) (Ezra 3:3), and it is stated, <i>The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at dusk</i> (ben ha-arbayim) (Ex. 29:39). Now concerning the Passover sacrifice, about which the term <i>ben ha-arbayim</i> (at dusk) is employed, we find that Scripture states, <i>there thou shalt sacrifice the passover-offering at even</i> (erev), <i>at the coming</i> (bo)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">201</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Translated literally.</i> <i>of the sun, at the season that thou earnest forth out of Egypt</i> (Deut. 16:6). Rabbi Solomon<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">202</sup><i class=\"footnote\">So <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38.</i> explains that the reference is to the time that the sun comes to the west.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">203</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is not actually said by Rashi. What I.E. means is that according to Rashi, Deut. 16:6 must be interpreted in this way.</i> However, this is not the meaning of <i>bo</i>. It refers to the opposite of the sun’s going forth upon the earth<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">204</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, <i>bo ha-shemesh</i> means the setting of the sun.</i> since it is written, <i>the sun went out</i> (yatza) <i>upon the earth</i> (Gen. 19:23),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">205</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Translated literally.</i> which means the time that the sun first begins to be seen on the earth. Similarly, <i>And when the sun comes</i> (ba) <i>he shall be clean</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">206</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Translated literally.</i> (Lev. 22:7) means when the sun shall no longer be seen upon the ground. Now it is written concerning a nocturnal seminal emission, <i>But it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall bathe himself in water; and when the sun comes</i> (u-khe-vo ha-shemesh)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">207</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, goes down, since the first part of the verse speaks of <i>when evening cometh</i>.</i> <i>he may come within the camp</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">208</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Only the first part of the verse appears in the text of I.E. However, since his main proof is from the second part, the entire verse is inserted into the translation and translated literally.</i> (Deut. 23:12). If this is not so, then let Rabbi Solomon explain what difference there is between “when the sun comes” with regard to Passover and “when the sun comes” with regard to a nocturnal seminal emission. It is the same with <i>and when the sun comes he</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">209</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One who is ritually impure.</i> <i>shall be clean</i> (Lev. 22:7).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">210</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If he has immersed himself.

They interpret this to refer to the final setting of the sun.</i> (I Sam. 20:5). However, they do not recognize or understand the truth. It is written, <i>Tomorrow is the new moon…And in the third day thou shalt hide thyself well</i> (I Sam. 20:18, 19), the meaning of which is: when close to evening of the third day starting from today comes, you shall hide yourself well in the field where you are presently hidden. It is because of this that Jonathan said, <i>until the third evening</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">214</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, <i>ad ha-erev ha-shelishit</i> does not mean until the third of the day’s three evenings arrives but rather the evening of the third day arrives.

Hence <i>shamayim</i> is a dual form.</i> We thus have two evenings: one when the sun sets, that is, the time when the sun descends beneath the earth; the second when its light disappears from the clouds.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">221</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hence the term <i>arbayim</i>, which literally means evenings.</i> Now there is close to one and a third hours between them.

The accounting is as follows: Abraham was 70 years old when God made the “covenant between the pieces” with him and told him that his children would be strangers for 400 years (Gen. 15:13). Abraham then went to Haran and spent five years there, as it is written, <i>And Abraham was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran</i> (Gen. 12:4). Now Isaac was born when Abraham was 100 years old (Gen. 21:5). Abraham thus lived in Canaan for 30 years without a son. Exodus, as noted above, starts the count from the “covenant between the pieces.” Genesis starts the count with the birth of Isaac 30 years later. However, it must be pointed out that the <i>Seder Olam</i>’s accounting is based on a number of assumptions: a) That the covenant between the pieces occurred when Abraham was 70 years old. Scripture nowhere says so. b) That Abraham returned to Haran. Scripture does not say this either. Hence I.E. did not want to accept the <i>Seder Olam</i>’s calculations. The question thus remains how to reconcile the number of years mentioned in Exodus with those given in Genesis.</i> The commentaries were forced to say that the prophecy <i>I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees</i> (Gen. 15:7) is not connected to the above-noted chapter<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">481</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chapter 15, the “covenant between the pieces,” as Abraham was yet to leave the land.</i> but was said later.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">482</sup><i class=\"footnote\">After he returned to Canaan and permanently settled there. This too is not in keeping with the plain meaning of the text and is an argument against the <i>Seder Olam</i>.</i> However, there is no need for all of this.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">483</sup><i class=\"footnote\">a) To assume in contradiction to Gen. 15:5 that Abraham was 70 at the “covenant between the pieces”; b) to assume that Abraham returned to Haran; c) to assume that Gen. 15:7 is out of place and was not said at the “covenant between the pieces.”</i> Only the counting of the four hundred years is from the day that Isaac was born.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">484</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As explained by the <i>Seder Olam</i>, for Scripture speaks there of <i>thy seed</i>.</i> The additional thirty years start from the day that Abraham left Ur of the Chaldees, the land of his nativity, and came with his father to Haran, as it is written, <i>and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there</i> (Gen. 11: 31). Abraham lived in Haran with his father for five years.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">485</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If the 430 years start from the day that Abraham left Ur then Abraham had to be 70 years old when he left that city, for Isaac was born when Abraham was 100 years old and Israel was liberated 400 years later (see note 480). Now Scripture tells us that Abraham left Haran when he was 75 (Gen. 12:4). Therefore he spent five years in Haran. In his commentary on Genesis, I.E. implies that we cannot ascertain how many years Abraham spent in Haran. See I.E. on Gen. 12:1 and the notes thereto.</i> He came to the land of Canaan at the age of seventy-five and never returned to Haran.

For Scripture says, <i>And God called the light day</i> (Gen. 1:8), the reference being from the time that the sun rises until the time that it sets; <i>and to the darkness He called night,</i> the reference being from the time that the sun sets until the time that it rises. The night is thus the opposite of day, as the darkness is the opposite of the light. This being the case, how can Scripture refer to the evening, which commences at the time that the sun sets and lasts until the morning, as “day” when it is then night? Behold, concerning such people Scripture states, <i>They change the night into day</i> (Job 17:12). Now note that the word day is used in Hebrew in two ways.

Moses told Hobab, [<i>Leave us not, I pray thee</i>] <i>forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness</i> (Num. 10:31). Now we know that Israel camped around Sinai for about a year. Lo and behold, Moses’ very words prove this to be so. For Moses is quoted in the Torah portion, <i>These are the words</i> as saying, <i>The Lord our God spoke unto us in Horeb, saying: …turn you, and take your journey</i> (Deut. 1:6,7).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">From Sinai.</i> Now this was said close to their time of journey.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For <i>And we journeyed from Horeb</i> (Deut. 1:19) follows immediately.</i> Moses continued, <i>And I spoke unto you at that time saying: I am not able to bear you myself alone</i> (Deut. 1:9); for <i>the Lord your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude</i> (Deut. 1:10). The reason Moses mentioned this to them was that God told Jacob, <i>Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a company of peoples; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession</i> (Gen. 48:4). Now the meaning of the latter is: when your seed increase I will give them the land. Moses therefore said, <i>the Lord your God hath multiplied you</i> and the time for you to inherit the land has come. However, since you are so numerous I was not able to carry you alone,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 1:9,12.</i> and I had to place over you captains of thousands and captains of hundreds.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 1:15</i> Now this<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Placing captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over the people to assist Moses in judging them.</i> was the advice given to Moses by Jethro on the morrow following his coming to the wilderness of Sinai.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ex. 18:13.</i> Moses therefore said to Hobab, who, as we explained, is to be identified with Jethro, <i>We are journeying</i> (Num. 10:29).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Unto the place of which the Lord said: I will give it to you; come thou with us, and we will do thee good; for the Lord hath spoken good concerning Israel.</i></i> Hobab responded, <i>I will not go; but I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred</i> (Num. 10:30). This is what <i>And Moses let his father-in-law depart; and he went his way into his own land</i> (v. 27) refers to. I will now explain why the chapter dealing with Jethro was inserted here. It was placed here because Scripture had just mentioned the evil that Amalek did to Israel. The Torah wants to contrast it with the good that Jethro rendered Israel. Scripture notes, <i>And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the Lord had done to Israel</i> (v. 9) and that he gave proper and correct counsel to Moses and Israel. Moses told Jethro, <i>and thou shalt be to us instead of eyes</i> (Num. 10:31), meaning that he enlightened their eyes.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.E. takes <i>ve-hayita</i> (and thou shalt be) as a perfect. He renders Num. 10:31 as: and you were to us instead of eyes; i.e., you enlightened us with your council. See I.E. on Num. 10:31 where he quotes this interpretation and prefaces it with the phrase, “many say.”</i> King Saul similarly said,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To Jethro’s descendants.</i> <i>for ye showed kindness to all the children of Israel</i> (I Sam. 15:6).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reference is to the good advice which Jethro gave to Israel. King Saul said <i>ye</i> because the good that Jethro had done accrued to the benefit of his descendants. See Kimchi on I Sam. 15:6.</i> Now because Scripture states in the preceding chapter, <i>the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation</i> (Ex. 17:16), namely, that when God gives Israel rest they are obligated to wage war against Amalek, the Torah mentions the account of Jethro. For the descendants of Jethro lived in proximity to the nation of Amalek,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See I Sam. 15:6. Literally, For they were with the nation of Amalek. <i>Vat, Ebr.</i> 38 reads: should they ever be found together with Amalek.

Ibn Ezra apparently quoted Rabbi Moses’ opinion because it can be linguistically defended, while the Talmud derives it from a <i>gezerah shavah.</i> See <i>Sabbath</i> 86b.

According to Rabbi Moses the word <i>chodesh</i> means new moon, as in I Sam. 20:18 which reads <i>machar ha-chodesh</i> (tomorrow is the new moon). According to Rabbi Moses our verse should be interpreted as follows: On the third new moon, i.e., on the first day of the third month after the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day, i.e., on the aforementioned new moon, came they into the wilderness of Sinai. It should be noted that on Ex. 12:2, I.E. quotes Rabbi Moses as saying that the term <i>rosh chodesh</i> (new moon) is tautological because the word <i>chodesh</i> by itself means new moon.</i> Scripture notes this<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That Israel came to the wilderness of Sinai on the first day of the third month.</i> because the Torah was given a few days after Israel camped.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Around Mount Sinai.</i> Perhaps Moses went up to God<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See verse 3.</i> on day one<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Of the third month.

However, once we have the tradition that the Torah was given on the sixth of Sivan we may logically interpret the above verse so. Cf. <i>Sabbath</i> 86b: “The Decalogue was given on the sixth (of the month of Sivan). Rabbi Jose says on the seventh.”</i> According to the rules of the calendar, if<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For some reason.</i> a day was not added to the month of Iyyar,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, if Iyyar had 29 days as it usually does.</i> then the Torah was given on a Friday.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to the rabbis of the Talmud (<i>Sabbath</i> 87b), Israel left Egypt on a Thursday. Now if the new moon at that time was not consecrated by observation but rather by following the rules of the Hebrew calendar, then the sixth of Sivan had to fall on a Friday. See chapter 1 of the <i>Mekhilta</i> on the Torah portion <i>Be-Shallach.</i></i> It is possible that Scripture reads, <i>the same day</i> because the distance<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Reading <i>merchak</i> as in <i>Vat.

                "AND GOD SPOKE. There are some very difficult questions to be raised in this chapter. Many say that God only uttered the first two statements.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Biblical term for what is known in the western world as the Ten Commandments is <i>aseret ha-devarim</i> (Deut. 4:13; 10:4), the ten words or the ten statements. This is term that will be employed in this work.</i> As proof they offer the fact that the first statement reads, <i>I am the Lord thy God</i> (v. 2), and the second, <i>for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God</i> (v. 5).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, the first two statements are in the first person while the next three are in the third person. Hence they assume that only the first two were uttered by God. These commentaries also assume that statements 6-10 were spoken by Moses, as it is illogical to assume that God would utter two statements first, that Moses would then utter three statements, and that the Lord would then resume speaking. Thus the first question to be raised i n this chapter is, did God utter all ten statements or only the first two? If he uttered all the statements, why is there a change in person after the first two?</i> However, the third statement reads, <i>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain</i> (v. 7) and does not say “My” name; the fourth reads, <i>for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested on the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it</i> (v. 11); the fifth reads, <i>that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</i> (v. 12). One may ask, how can <i>I am the Lord</i> be counted among the Ten Statements,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As Jewish tradition does.</i> as God is the one who commands?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, <i>I am the Lord</i> is an introductory statement to that which follows. That is, verse 3 is to be understood as follows: I am the Lord thy God…who commands you the following.</i> Clearly, <i>I am the Lord</i> is neither a positive nor a negative commandment. The following questions are even more difficult than the above-noted ones. When we read this chapter, namely, the Torah portion <i>Va-Yishma Yitro</i> (And Jethro heard)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ex. 18-20.</i> first, and then read the Torah portion <i>Va-Etchannan</i> (And I besought) (Deut. 3:23; 7:11), we notice that from <i>I am the Lord</i> (v. 2) through <i>the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name in vain</i> (v. 7) there is no difference in the two portions.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The account of God’s revelation is described twice in the Torah, in <i>Yitro</i> and in <i>Va-Etchannan.</i></i> However, starting from <i>Remember</i> (v. 8) to the conclusion of the Ten Statements, there are differences in every place. <i>Yitro</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, the first chapter.</i> reads, <i>Remember</i> (v. 5), while <i>Va-Etchannan</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, the second chapter.</i> has, <i>Observe</i> (Deut. 5:12). The latter also ends with the addition, <i>as the Lord thy God commanded thee. Yitro</i> states, <i>nor thy cattle</i> (v. 10); <i>Va-Etchannan</i> adds, <i>nor thine ox, nor thine ass</i> (Deut. 5:14). More difficult than all of these is that the reason given for the Sabbath in <i>Yitro</i> is, <i>for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth</i> (v. 12). The verse then goes on to say, <i>wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it</i> (v. 12). Now these verses are not quoted in <i>Va-Etchannan,</i> which offers a totally different reason for the Sabbath. It states, <i>And thou shalt remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt</i> (Deut. 5:15). The latter concludes with, <i>therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day.</i> Scripture tells us in <i>Yitro</i> and in <i>Va-Etchannan</i> that the reward for honoring one’s father and mother is <i>that thy days may be long.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ex. 20:12; Deut. 5:16.</i></i> However, <i>Va-Etchannan</i> adds, <i>and that it may go well with thee</i> (Deut. 5:16). It also adds, <i>as the Lord thy God commanded thee</i> (<i>Ibid</i>.) to the commandment dealing with honoring one’s father and mother. <i>Yitro</i> reads, <i>Thou shalt not murder. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not bear false witness</i> (v. 13). <i>Va-Etchannan</i> reads: <i>Thou shalt not murder. Neither shalt thou commit adultery. Neither shalt thou steal. Neither shalt thou bear false witness</i> (Deut. 5:17). <i>Yitro</i> reads, <i>ed sheker</i> (false witness) (v. 13). <i>Va-Etchannan</i> reads, <i>ed shav</i> (false witness) (Deut. 5:17). <i>Yitro</i> reads, <i>Thou shalt not covet</i> (lo tachmod) <i>thy neighbor’s house; thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife</i> (v. 14). <i>Va-Etchannan</i> has, <i>Neither shalt thou covet thy neighbor’s wife: neither shalt thou desire</i> (ve-lo titaweh) <i>thy neighbor’s house</i> (Deut. 5:18). It also has, <i>his field</i>. “His field” is missing in <i>Yitro.</i> In <i>Yitro, his man-servant, nor his maid-servant</i> precede <i>his ox, nor his ass</i> (v. 14). However, in <i>Va-Etchannan</i> (Deut. 5:18) <i>his ox, or his ass</i> precede <i>his man-servant, or his maid-servant.</i> <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is not so. In both versions <i>his man-servant</i> and <i>his maid-servant</i> precede <i>his ox</i> and <i>his ass.</i> I.E. obviously quoted from memory and committed a <i>faux pas.</i> Note: our verse and Deut. 5:18 are both translated literally.</i> <i>Yitro</i> states: <i>And God spoke all these words, saying</i> (v. 1). However, <i>Va-Etchannan</i> reads: <i>These words the Lord spoke unto all your assembly</i> (Deut. 5:19). When we searched the words of our sages to see what they said concerning this, we found that they said, “<i>Remember</i> (v. 8) and <i>Observe</i> (Deut. 5:12) were uttered simultaneously.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Mekhilta</i> on this verse.</i> Now this statement is, as I will explain, more difficult than all the other questions which we raised. Heaven forbid that I say the sages spoke incorrectly, for our minds are insignificant in comparison to theirs. The problem is that our contemporaries take the words of our sages at face value. However, this is not so, as I will explain after I finish noting all of the questions this chapter raises. I will then explain the proper way to remove all problems and questions pertaining to this chapter. <i>Observe</i> and <i>Remember</i> could have been uttered simultaneously only miraculously. Now even if we admit that a miracle did occur there is still room to ask why Scripture did not write <i>Remember</i> and <i>Observe</i> in <i>Yitro</i> and also in <i>Va-Etchannan</i>? Furthermore, what shall we do with the other verses that come in two versions? If we assume that they were simultaneously uttered, like <i>Observe</i> and <i>Remember,</i> why didn’t our sages of blessed memory mention it, as this is an even greater miracle? For even if we assume that two different words with one meaning can be uttered simultaneously, one can still ask, how is it possible for many verses with different meanings to be stated at the same time? Additionally, why would God say, <i>as the Lord thy God commanded thee</i> (Deut. 5:12)?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Why would God refer to himself in the third person (Krinsky)?</i> Furthermore, when before the assembly around Mount Sinai did the Lord command one to honor his father and mother?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If we assume that God told Israel, <i>Honor thy father and thy mother, as the Lord thy God commanded thee</i> (Deut. 5:16). The question arises, when before this did God command Israel to honor their parents? The Bible never recorded such a command prior to the revelation at Sinai.</i> <i>Yitro</i> does not have, <i>that it may be well with thee</i> (Deut. 5:16).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the fifth statement, but Deuteronomy does.</i> Hence God said this, or He did not say it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hence only one of the two versions was said by God.</i> Furthermore, how could God say, <i>Neither shalt thou commit adultery</i> (Deut. 5:17)?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This verse has a <i>vav</i> as a prefix while verse 14 does not.</i> Also, how could God say, <i>thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house</i> (v. 14) and in <i>Va-Etchannan</i> say, <i>Neither shalt thou covet thy neighbor’s wife</i> (Deut. 5:18)?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.E. is concentrating again on the prefix <i>vav</i> in Deuteronomy.</i> Additionally, how could God say, <i>his man-servant, or his maid-servant</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Yitro</i> (v. 14).</i> and then <i>his ox, or his ass,</i> and at the same time say the opposite?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, place <i>his ox</i> and <i>his ass</i> before, <i>his man-servant</i> and <i>his maid-servant,</i> as I.E. believes Deut. 5:18. does. However, see above note 10.</i> It is impossible to rationally accept such things. Even more difficult than all of the things that I have mentioned above is that all the wonders which Moses performed have some parallel [in the world of our experience].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The miracles performed by Moses are based on natural law and thus have some parallel in nature.</i> This will be understood by the intelligent. Now, God’s saying <i>Remember</i> and <i>Observe</i> simultaneously is a wonder of wonders.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It has no parallel in the everyday world.</i> Such a wonder should have been clearly recorded in the Torah more than all the signs and wonders that are noted therein. Even if we maintain that God’s speech is unlike human speech,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And God can say two things at the same time.</i> how did Israel understand what God was saying? For if a person hears, <i>Remember,</i> and <i>Observe</i> simultaneously, he understands neither the one nor the other.

We clearly know that the eye perceives much better than the ear does, for we have indisputable proof that thunder sounds at the very moment that the lightning is seen. Now the eye perceives the lightning from a distance.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, the eye sees the thunder instantaneously.</i> However, the sound is brought to the ear by the air. The sound travels slowly and does not reach the ear until a moment has passed. Now the forms of the letters that one enunciates are “written” in the air after the manner of the five organs which produce them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There are five types of letters: gutturals, palatal, dentals, linguals, and labials. The throat “writes” the gutturals in the air, the lips “write” their linguals in the air, and so on. This type of writing has its own manner, and it differs from the writing which the hand produces on paper.</i> They are not written in the manner of script, which is produced by the human hand.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.E. is trying to explain why the eye can simultaneously see two words while the ear can only hear one word at a time. He thus explains that sound (words written in the ear) is different from script.</i> Now the entire letter <i>zayin</i> enters the ear before the <i>kaf,</i> the <i>vav,</i> and the <i>resh</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word <i>zakhor</i> (remember) is enunciated as if spelled <i>zayin, kaf, vav, resh.</i> In order for the word <i>zakhor</i> to be heard, one must hear, the <i>zayin, kaf, vav, resh</i> in succession. If one hears them at the same time, one does not know what is being said.</i> Even if we assume that <i>Remember</i> and <i>Observe</i> were miraculously uttered simultaneously, how was Israel able to understand what was being said? If we assume that the ear, which does not normally have the ability to hear two words at the time, was at that time miraculously able to hear two words at the same time, why didn’t the sages of blessed memory mention this? For this is a greater miracle than God’s uttering two words simultaneously.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The sages should have said that <i>Observe</i> and <i>Remember</i> were heard simultaneously rather than were said simultaneously.</i> Aside from this, what shall we do with the remaining questions relating to variant verses which, unlike <i>Observe</i> and <i>Remember,</i> do not have the same meaning? What are we to do with statements that appear in <i>Va-Etchannan</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, the second chapter.</i> and do not appear in <i>Yitro</i>?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, the first chapter.</i> Also, how are we to harmonize <i>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house</i> (v. 14) with <i>Neither shalt thou covet they neighbor’s house</i> (Deut. 5:18)?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See note 18.</i> How are we to explain the reversals?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, placing <i>his man-servant, nor his maid-servant,</i> before <i>his ox, nor his ass in yitro</i> (v. 14), while placing <i>his ox, or his ass</i> before <i>his man-servant, or his maid-servant.</i>, in <i>Va-Etchannan</i> (Deut. 5:18).

See below.</i> However, before I begin, I will explain the words of our sages of blessed memory.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, explain what the sages meant when they said that <i>Remember</i> and <i>Observe</i> were uttered simultaneously.</i> ",
                "Abraham the author declares: It is the style of those who speak Hebrew to express their thoughts very clearly at times. However, at other times it is their style to say what they must in as few words as is necessary for a person to understand their meaning. Note that words are like bodies and their meanings are like souls. The body is, as it were, a vessel for the soul. Hence all the wise men of all nations<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, tongues. In other words, all wise men who speak a different language.</i> are in the habit of preserving the ideas conveyed by a word<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.E. literally reads: The wise men…preserve meanings.</i> and are not concerned with changes in wording when the meaning remains one and the same. I will now offer you a number of examples.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Of instances in Scripture where the same idea is conveyed in different words.</i> God told Cain: <i>And now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from the ground… When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth</i> (Gen. 4:11,12). Cain replied: <i>Behold, Thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the land</i> (Gen. 4:14). Now who is so simple as to think<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Vat. Ebr. 38</i> reads: Now he who is simple thinks.</i> that the latter verse does not convey what the former verse does because of the change in words. Look, Eliezer said, <i>Give me to drink</i> (hagmi’ini), <i>I pray thee</i> (Gen. 24:17). However, he quoted himself as saying, <i>Let me drink</i> (hashkini), <i>I pray thee</i> (Gen. 24:45). Moses said, <i>the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon</i> (Ex. 12:29). However, it is earlier written, <i>the first-born of the maid-servant that is behind the mill</i> (Ex. 11:5). In Deuteronomy, Moses quoted the prayer which he offered on behalf of Israel because of the golden calf (Deut. 9:26-29). Now to the unintelligent, this prayer appears totally different from the one recorded in the Torah portion <i>Ki Tissa</i> (Ex. 32:11-14). The general rule is, one will find the same meaning in different words whenever anything is repeated in Scripture, such as the dreams of Pharaoh<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Gen. 41:1-7; 17-24.</i> and Nebuchadnezzar,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Dan. 4.</i> and many other things. Now Scripture, as I noted, sometimes abridges and other times elaborates. It does the same with prefixes.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, servile letters.</i> At times it adds them. At other times it leaves them out. However, the meaning remains the same. Thus God said, <i>and blue</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hebrew, <i>u-tekhelet.</i></i> <i>and purple</i> (Ex. 25:4). However, Moses said, <i>blue</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hebrew, <i>tekhelet.</i></i> <i>and purple</i> (Ex. 28:6). God said, <i>onyx stones</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hebrew, <i>avne shoham.</i></i> (Ex. 25:7). However, Moses said, <i>and onyx stones</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hebrew, <i>ve-avne shoham.</i></i> (Ex. 35:9). There are many such instances. Either way is correct, as the verse which leaves out the <i>vav</i> is employing a concise style. There is no harm in it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For it does not change the basic meaning of the verse.</i> Similarly, the verse which has a <i>vav</i> in it does no harm because it adds clarity. Now one does not search for a reason that a <i>vav,</i> which is enunciated by the mouth,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Such as the <i>vav</i> of <i>ve-avne,</i> or <i>u-tekhelet.</i></i> is sometimes left out, sometimes written, and sometimes added.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, it is a superfluous <i>vav.</i> See Vol. 1, Introduction, p. XVII.</i> For any of the aforementioned<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ways of writing.</i> is correct. We do not look for the reason why an enunciated <i>vav</i> was written.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Or was left out.</i> This being the case, why should we look for reasons regarding<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The omission or non-omission of.</i> the silent <i>vav</i> which is not enunciated? For example, we should not ask why the word <i>le-olam</i> (forever)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Olam</i> can be spelled with or without a <i>vav.</i></i> is written with or without a <i>vav</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>vav</i> in <i>olam</i> is silent.</i> Now people want reasons for full and also for deficient spellings.

Suppose someone tells me, “Write the following to my friend: I so and so love you forever;” and I spelled <i>ploni</i> (so and so) without a <i>vav,</i> and also <i>ohevekha</i> (I love you) without a <i>vav</i> and <i>le-olam</i> (forever) deficiently.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, without a <i>vav.</i></i> Then Reuben came to me and asked me why I wrote deficiently.

Levi obviously cannot, for there are no rules regarding the use of full or deficient spellings.</i> I do not want to dwell on this. However, the intelligent will understand what I mean.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.E. apparently believed that Moses had some discretion in choosing the spelling to be employed in writing the Torah.</i> I will now explain the above-noted difficulties.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The questions raised by I.E. at the beginning of his comments on this verse.</i> ",
                "Note that this chapter preserves the wording of the Ten Statements exactly as uttered by God, for Scripture states, <i>And God spoke all these words, saying</i> (v. 1). The statements open with <i>I am the Lord thy God,</i> and close with <i>nor any thing that is thy neighbor’s</i> (v. 14). Moses also noted, <i>These words the Lord spoke unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire</i> (Deut. 5:19) when he mentioned the Ten Statements a second time. The Ten Statements have no break in them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">God spoke all ten of them without pause. I.E. takes issue with those who held that only the first two statements were uttered by God.</i> Furthermore, the Lord uttered all of them exactly as they were written by the finger of God. One can refute the evidence<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">64</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To the contrary.</i> from the third, fourth, and fifth statements, which are not in the first person,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And thus seem to indicate that God did not utter them.</i> as follows: now that you have accepted the Lord as your God,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As the first and second statements tell you to do.</i> <i>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain</i> (v. 7).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">67</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, the reason the third statement is in the second person is that its meaning is: Now that you have accepted the Lord as your God, <i>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.</i></i> Similarly <i>for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth</i> (v. 11).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is to be similarly interpreted. That is, its meaning is: for in six days the Lord, whom you accepted as your God, made heaven and earth. The fifth statement should be similarly interpreted.</i> It should also be noted that it is the style of those who speak Hebrew to speak in this manner.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To start in the first person and then go on to use the third person.</i> Thus Scripture states, <i>neither shall the fat of My feast remain all night until the morning</i> (Ex. 23:18). This is then followed by <i>into the house of the Lord thy God</i> (Ex. 23:19). There are many such examples. Those who say that the first statement<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>I am the Lord thy God,</i> etc.</i> is not part of the Ten Statements differ in the following. Some say that <i>Thou shalt have no other gods before Me</i> (v. 3) is the first statement, and <i>Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image</i> (v. 4) the second. However, this is incorrect, as both statements deal with one and the same thing.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hence they cannot be counted as two separate statements.</i> One (v. 3) deals with accepting another god in secret and the other (v. 4) openly.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">72</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Publicly and openly accepting another god.</i> One (v. 3) deals with belief and the other (v. 4) with action. Now in the statement <i>Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy…thou, thy son…thy daughter,</i> openly or secretly is all in the one commandment (v. 8).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">73</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The point is that the fourth statement has a number of sub-statements; however, it is all considered one statement. The same must apply to the prohibition against worshipping idols.</i> Others say that <i>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house</i> (v. 14) is the ninth statement, and <i>thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife</i> (<i>Ibid</i>.) is the tenth.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">74</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They count verse 3 and verse 4 as the first statement.</i> They offer as proof the fact that God said, <i>Thou shalt not covet</i> twice, for there are two types of coveting. One is active, like an act of thievery, as in <i>neither shall any man covet thy land</i> (Ex. 34:24).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">75</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The import of this verse is, no one will steal your land. According to this interpretation the first half of verse 14 deals with theft and the second part with desire.</i> Now if the latter dealt with coveting in one’s heart, then the Land of Israel would be a bad place.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">76</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For people only covet that which is desirable. Thus to tell Israel that no one will covet their land is to tell Israel that their land will be undesirable.</i> The second type of coveting is with one’s heart. Hence Moses had to explain<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">77</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Deut. 5:18.</i> that its meaning is,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">78</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The meaning of <i>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house.</i></i> thou shalt not desire.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">79</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, that its meaning is also: thou shalt not desire (Krinsky).</i> However, this too<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">80</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Like the interpretation which lists verses 3 and 4 as two independent statements.</i> is nonsense. Why would God mention thievery only with regard to a house and not mention other things along with it?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">81</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, the other things listed in verse 14.</i> I will offer you proof from the very words of Moses that these commentators explained incorrectly. Look, God said, <i>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house</i> (v. 14). However, Moses said, <i>Neither shalt thou covet thy neighbor’s wife</i> (Deut. 5:18). In their opinion, the second <i>Thou shalt not covet</i> written in our chapter refers to coveting with one’s heart, and the first one deals with the theft of a house. If this is the case, then Moses<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">82</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Deut. 5:18.</i> inverted the matter, for he used, <i>Neither shalt thou desire</i> with <i>thy neighbor’s house,</i> and <i>Thou shalt not covet,</i> which means thou shalt not steal, with <i>thy neighbor’s wife.</i> Their definitions are thus destroyed. The truth of the matter is that <i>I am the Lord thy God</i> is, as I will explain in its place, the first statement. ",
                "I will now comment on <i>Remember</i> and <i>Observe.</i> Note that the meaning, not the wording, is preserved.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">83</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Whenever Scripture repeats an account or a dictum.</i> Thus our father Isaac said to Esau, <i>that my soul may bless thee before I die</i> (Gen. 27:4). However, Rebekah told Jacob that she heard Isaac say, <i>and bless thee before the Lord before my death</i> (Gen. 27:7). Now <i>lifne moti</i> (before I die) <i>(Ibid</i>.) means the same as <i>betrem amut</i> (before I die).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">84</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The idea is the same although the words are different.</i> This being the case,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">85</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That Scripture preserves meanings.</i> why did Rebekah add, <i>before the Lord</i>?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">86</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When Isaac did not say this.</i> The answer is that Rebekah knew that Isaac was a prophet of the Lord and that the blessing which he would pronounce would be prophetically uttered. Hence she said, <i>before the Lord</i> to Jacob.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">87</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When paraphrasing to Jacob what Isaac had told Esau.</i> She was, as it were, explaining the meaning of the blessing.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">88</sup><i class=\"footnote\">She was telling Jacob that Isaac’s blessing would be prophetically uttered.</i> Moses acted in a similar fashion. The Ten Statements recorded in this chapter are God’s very words without any additions or subtractions, and they alone were inscribed on the tablets of the covenant. It is not as Saadiah says that <i>Remember</i> was on one side and <i>Observe</i> was on the second side.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">89</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to Saadiah Gaon each tablet contained a different version of the Ten Statements. One tablet corresponded to the version of Exodus and one tablet corresponded to the version in Deuteronomy.</i> The Ten Statements recorded in the Torah portion <i>Va-Etchannan</i> are the words of Moses. The fact that the second version twice reads, <i>as the Lord thy God commanded thee</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">90</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 5:14,15. According to I.E. the meaning of the aforementioned is, as the Lord thy God commanded thee in the Ten Statements, the reference being to the first version.</i> is positive proof that this is so.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">91</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That the second version is Mosaic.</i> Note that memory is stored in the back of brain, which is in the head. The forms are there preserved. Now memory includes observance.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">92</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If one does not remember, he cannot observe.</i> The meaning of <i>Remember</i> is that one should keep in mind every day of the week what day that happens to be.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">93</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Calendars were very rare in the ancient world.</i> The reason for all of this is that one will observe the seventh day and do no work on it. The reason for remembering is for observance.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">94</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Remembering the Sabbath thus facilitates its observance.</i> Thus when God said, <i>Remember,</i> all the people understood that its meaning was, <i>Observe.</i> Hence <i>Remember</i> and <i>Observe</i> were, as it were, said simultaneously. Moses [similarly] had no need to mention <i>for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth</i> (v. 11) in the second version<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">95</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Of the Ten Statements.</i> because he had at first stated, <i>as the Lord thy God commanded thee</i> (Deut. 5:13). The latter clause is to be understood as if it read, <i>as the Lord thy God commended thee</i> in “your Torah,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It appears that Ibn Ezra follows the opinion that the Torah was given piecemeal. Thus when Moses repeated the Torah, the Israelites had the first four books of the Torah in their hands.</i> in the commandment opening with <i>Remember</i> (v. 8) and closing with <i>and hallowed it</i> (v. 11). Now God commanded that man- and maid-servants rest on the Sabbath.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">97</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 10.</i> The Lord, however, did not give a reason for this.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">98</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, no reason for this was given in the first version of the Decalogue.</i> Moses therefore explained the reason. Moses said the reason God commanded that servants should rest on the Sabbath is that a person should remember that, like the servant, he too was a slave in Egypt, and God redeemed him from there. Note that eight of the statements are entirely negative commandments and that <i>Honor thy father and thy mother</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">99</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.E. has already noted that <i>I am the Lord thy God</i> is a positive commandment; hence two of the Ten Statements are positive commandments and eight are negative commandments.</i> is a positive commandment. The rational wisdom which God has implanted in man’s heart teaches us that we are obligated to repay with good the good that a person has done for us. Now a child comes into the world only because of his parents. They nurse him, they care for him, they raise him, they give him to drink, they feed him, and they dress him. One has to honor one’s parents because they are the cause of his living upon the face of the earth. Hence the reward for honoring one’s parents is <i>that thy days may be long upon the land</i> (v. 12). God commanded a person to honor his parents because God breathed a soul into him<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">100</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Gen. 2:7.</i> through his parents who prepared the body, for he who honors them honors God. Now Moses said, <i>Honor thy father and thy mother</i> (Deut. 5:16) and then added by way of explanation, <i>as the Lord thy God commanded thee</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">101</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse continues, <i>that thy days may be long.</i></i> As I will explain in my comments on the verse that opens with the words <i>Thou shalt not eat it</i> (Deut. 12:25), reward is given for the observance of the positive commandments and punishment is meted out for the violation of negative commandments. Moses thus said that one is obligated to honor one’s parents <i>that thy days may be long</i> (Deut. 5:16). The obligation to honor one’s parents is dictated by reason. In addition, one who honor’s his parents will receive a good reward, namely, <i>thy days will be long</i> because one listened to the voice of God who commanded us to honor them. Thus what was noted in the explanation of Rebekah’s words<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">102</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Namely, that when Rebekah quoted Isaac she interspersed explanatory comments.</i> also applies to what Moses said. I have already noted that the terms <i>onyx stones</i> and <i>and onyx stones</i> mean the same thing. <i>Thou shalt not commit adultery</i> (v. 13) and <i>Neither shalt thou commit adultery</i> (Deut. 5:17), and <i>ed sheker</i> (false witness) (v. 13) and <i>ed shav</i> (false witness) (Deut. 5:17), are similarly “children of one father.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">103</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, they have one meaning.</i> <i>Thou shalt not covet</i> (v. 14) and <i>neither shalt thou desire</i> (Deut. 5:18) likewise come out of one womb.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">104</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They have one meaning.</i> God said, <i>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house</i> (v. 14) because intelligent people first acquire a house and then a wife, next a man-servant and a maid-servant, and then an ox and an ass to plow their fields. Our chapter lists these items in this order. However, Moses<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">105</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Deut. 5:18.</i> listed them in another order, for young men first desire a woman, then a house. Now since Moses spoke of the house and the field, he next took note of the ox and the ass<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">106</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See note 10.</i> because they are used in plowing one’s field. Moses next mentioned the man-servant and the maid-servant. At the very end Moses, like God, generalized and said, <i>or any thing that is thy neighbor’s</i> (Deut. 5:18). Scripture reads, <i>These words the Lord spoke</i> (Deut. 5:19), and not <i>all these words</i> (v. 1) as is first written, because God’s words are intermingled with Moses’ words."

                "THE FIRST STATEMENT: I AM THE LORD. Note that all of the commandments fall into one of the following two categories. One category consists of rational laws which God implanted into the minds of all intelligent human beings. There are many such commandments. The only one of the Ten Statements which does not fall into this category is the command to observe the Sabbath. Hence every intelligent human being of every nation and of every tongue assents to them, for they are implanted in the human mind by reason. There is nothing to add to them or to subtract from them. Abraham observed them along with additional precepts.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">107</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to I.E., Abraham observed all the rational commandments plus the ritual of circumcision. See I.E. on Gen. 26:5.</i> God gave the Torah only to rational human beings. He who is without reason has no Torah. The second category that the precepts fall into is that of “hidden commandments,” that is, commandments for which that the Torah does not reveal any reason. Far be it, far be it for one to even think that any of these commandments contradict reason. We must in all instances observe everything that God has commanded us, whether their secret has or has not been revealed to us. If we find that one of the commandments contradicts reason, then we should not take it at face value but must search for its meaning in the books of our wise men, of blessed memory, to find out whether it is a parable. If we do not find this recorded,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">108</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If the sages do not say that this commandment is not to be taken literally.</i> then we must investigate and try to understand it with all of our strength. Perhaps we can explain it. If we cannot, then we must leave it as it is and admit that we do not know its meaning.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">109</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is a rational reason for every commandment, according to I.E. This is also the opinion of Maimonides. See <i>The Guide of the Perplexed,</i> 3:23. Saadiah Gaon, on the other hand, held that the commandments are divided into two groups, rational and arational commandments. See chapter 3 of Saadiah’s <i>Book of Beliefs and Opinions.</i></i> <i>Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart</i> (Deut. 10:16) is an example of the aforementioned. Now did God command us to sadistically murder people?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">110</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Which would be to kill, if we took <i>circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart</i> at face value.</i> We know of a certainty that each one of the commandments that are not placed upon us by reason has a secret meaning to it, though it be hidden from us. The fact that in some instances Scripture gives the reason why they were commanded is proof of this. Thus Scripture tells us that the Sabbath is in memory of God’s creation of the world; and the festival of unleavened bread, <i>that thou mayest remember the day when thou earnest forth out of the land of Egypt</i> (Deut. 16:3). Scripture states, <i>Love ye therefore the stranger; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt</i> (Deut. 10:19).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">111</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is interesting to note that I.E. does not consider the love of the stranger to be a rational law.</i> Sowing with two kinds of seeds is prohibited, <i>lest the fullness of the seed…be forfeited</i> (Deut. 22:9). Scripture states, <i>Only he</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">112</sup><i class=\"footnote\">An Israelite king.</i> <i>shall not multiply horses so that he does not cause the people to return to Egypt</i> (Deut. 17:16).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">113</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Translated according to I.E.</i> It similarly gives the reason why <i>Neither shall he</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">114</sup><i class=\"footnote\">An Israelite king.</i> <i>multiply wives to himself</i> (Deut. 17:17), namely, <i>that his heart turn not away</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>). The latter is not an independent commandment as Rabbi Simeon ben Kayyara<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">115</sup><i class=\"footnote\">An eighth-century Babylonian sage who codified Talmudic law in a work called the <i>Halakhot Gedolot.</i></i> states.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">116</sup><i class=\"footnote\">But is rather the reason Scripture gives for the commandment, <i>Neither shall he multiply wives to himself.</i></i> Scripture similarly tells us the reason for <i>and he</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">117</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The king.</i> <i>shall read therein</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">118</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the Torah.</i> (Deut. 17:19), namely, <i>that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren</i> (Deut. 17:20).

This is the case with many commandments.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">121</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Torah itself gives the reason for them.</i> Hence<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">122</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, since there are reasons for the commandments.</i> every intelligent human being whose eyes have been opened by God can learn from the Torah the secret of all the commandments. There are three types of commandments, namely, commandments observed with one’s heart, commandments observed by speech, and commandments observed by acts. The commandments observed with the heart are of two sorts, namely, positive and negative commandments. The positive commandments include: <i>Therefore thou shalt love the Lord thy God</i> (Deut. 11:1); <i>and to cleave unto him</i> (Deut. 11:22); <i>that thou mayest fear this glorious and awful Name</i> (Deut. 28:58); <i>but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself</i> (Lev. 19:18). The negative commandments include: <i>Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart</i> (Lev. 19:17.); <i>Thou shalt not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge</i> (Lev. 19:18). The commandments observed by speech also consist of positive and negative commandments. Among the positive commandments are: reading the <i>shema,</i> saying grace after meals, uttering the priestly benedictions, and making a confession [declaration] when one brings tithes.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">123</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Deut. 26:13-16.</i> There are many such commandments. Among the negative precepts<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">124</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Connected to speech.</i> we find: <i>Thou shalt not bear false witness</i> (v. 13); <i>Thou shalt not revile God</i> (Ex. 22:27), and <i>Thou shalt not curse the deaf</i> (Lev. 19:14). The positive commandments and negative commandments observed through actions are legion. There is no reason to mention them. The commandments incumbent on the heart are the most important and the most prominent of the commandments.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">125</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This too is the opinion of Bachya ibn Pakuda in his <i>Duties of the Heart.</i></i> Many people think that with the exception of idol worship there are no sins connected to thought.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">126</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, thoughts of the heart.</i> The truth of the matter is that idol worship is worse than all the other mental sins put together. Can they<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">127</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Those who deny the concept of sinful thoughts.</i> not see that Scripture writes, <i>There are six things which the Lord hateth</i> (Prov. 6:16), and then goes on to say, <i>A heart that deviseth wicked thoughts</i> (Prov. 6:18). Scripture furthermore states: <i>thou didst well that was in thy heart</i> (II Chron. 6:8); <i>Do good, O Lord, unto the good, And to them that are upright in their hearts</i> (Ps. 125:4); <i>Let your heart therefore be whole with the Lord our God</i> (I Kings 8:61): <i>I the Lord search the heart</i> (Jer. 17:10); <i>but the Lord looketh on the heart</i> (I Sam. 16:7). Now the first statement<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">128</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Of the Decalogue.</i> is the basis of the nine that follow it. Its place is among the precepts of the heart.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">129</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, it is close to the commandments of the heart.</i> The first statement teaches that one should believe with an unwavering faith that this glorious God, whose name is written but not pronounced,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">130</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>YHVH</i> (the Lord).</i> is one’s only God. ",
                "Rabbi Judah Ha-Levi, who rests in glory, once asked me why God said, <i>I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt</i> rather than, I am the Lord thy God who made heaven and earth and created you? I answered the following. Know that people who believe in God the glorious are not on the same level of faith. Many believe what they have heard; that is, they believe because their masters have told them so. Above them are those who believe because of what they have read in the Torah, which God gave to Moses. Now they would place their hands upon their mouths<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">131</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They would keep still.</i> if a heretic were to come along and argue that God does not exist, for they do not possess the means to answer. Now a person whose heart has moved him<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">132</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. Ex. 35:26.</i> to study the sciences, which are the steps that lead to the place of his desire,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">133</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The perfection of the soul. According to I.E. the aforementioned is the purpose of all study. See chapter 1 of I.E.’s <i>Yesod Morah.</i></i> will see God’s work in the metals, in the plants and living creatures, and in the human body itself. He will know the makeup of each organ according to the scientific explanations of how each organ functions. He will similarly know the reason for each organ’s form. His heart will then aspire to learn the science of the spheres that are the Lord’s works in the middle world,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">134</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For a description of the three worlds, see I.E. on Ex. 3:15.</i> which is everlasting. He will learn when the sun or moon is eclipsed. He will know how the moon causes the sun to be eclipsed. He will know why the moon is eclipsed and what causes its eclipses. He will know these things and be able to prove them beyond a shadow of a doubt. The intelligent person will come to know God by learning the ways of God.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">135</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, by studying nature.</i> Moses similarly stated, <i>show me now Thy ways, that I may know Thee</i> (Ex. 33:13). Now God the revered proclaimed, I <i>am the Lord thy God</i> in His first statement.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">136</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the Decalogue.</i> Only one who is of great intellect can understand this.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">137</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, that which follows.</i> I have already explained in the Torah portion, <i>Ve-Eleh Shemot</i> that God alone is everlasting without any change and that there is none aside from Him that exists forever, and none aside from Him is <i>enthroned of old, Selah,</i> (Ps. 55:20). God alone maintains the uppermost world<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">138</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See note 134.</i> by His power. The middle world is maintained by God’s power and by His holy angels, who are of the uppermost world. Ours, the lowest of the worlds, is maintained by God’s power plus the power of the two higher worlds. Now the statement <i>I am the Lord</i> is sufficient for the intelligent of any nation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">139</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is sufficient for a non-Jew to believe that God exists. He does not have to believe that God created the world.</i> But only Israel<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">140</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Reading <i>yisra’el</i> as in <i>Vat. Ebr.</i> 38 rather than <i>ve-yisra’el</i> as in the printed texts.</i> believes that the sky and earth were made close to five thousand years ago. The nations of the world do not deny that God alone made sky and earth. They differ only in that they maintain that God continuously creates without beginning or end.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">141</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They maintain that the world is eternal. It was never created and will never end (Krinsky). This is the opinion of Aristotle, who held that God and the world co-exist.</i> Now the Lord performed signs and wonders in Egypt until Moses brought them out of there so that He would be their God. Moses similarly said, <i>Or hath God assayed to go and take Him a nation from the midst of another nation</i> (Deut. 4:34). The meaning of the latter is that God did for Israel what He did not do for any other nation. God created the middle world.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">142</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The world of the spheres, stars, and planets.</i> He rules over the lowest of the worlds.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">143</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The earth.</i> Good or bad befalls every nation according to the arrangement of its star, for this is what God has apportioned to them. Now Israel was destined to continue in slavery according to the stars of its constellation. However, because of God’s love of the patriarchs, the Lord used His power to bring forth signs in the lowest world which were not decreed by the powers of the middle world. God removed Israel from the rule of the constellations and made them the people of His very own inheritance. It is because of this that the ancients say, “Israel has no star.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">144</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sabbath</i> 156a; <i>Nedarim</i> 32a.</i> I will yet explain this via parables in the Torah portion <i>Ki Tissa.</i> It was because of the signs that God performed in Egypt that Moses said, <i>Unto thee it was shown, that thou mightest know that the Lord, He is God; there is none else beside Him</i> (Deut. 4:35). Everyone, learnèd and nonlearnèd, adults and children, witnessed this. When recounting the events at the assembly at Sinai,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">145</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the following verse.</i> Moses added that Israel heard God’s voice. Thus, following the latter, Moses said, <i>Out of heaven He made thee to hear His voice, that He might instruct thee</i> (Deut. 4:36). At the very end<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">146</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Of his discourse.</i> Moses said that ultimate knowledge consists in the development of one’s mind to the point where one is able to prove to himself that the Lord alone is God.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">147</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.E.’s paraphrase of <i>Unto thee it was shown, that thou mightest know that the Lord, He is God; there is none else beside Him</i> (Deut. 4:35).</i> Scripture therefore states, <i>know this day, and lay it to thy heart, that the Lord, He is God in heaven above and upon the earth beneath; there is none else</i> (Deut. 4:39). David similarly said, <i>And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve Him</i> (I Chron. 28:9). Knowledge is in the heart.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">148</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, being convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt.</i> It does not refer to confession with one’s lips.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">149</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It does not refer to mere confession of faith.</i> Now it is for the intelligent that God said, <i>I am the Lord</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">150</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For the intelligent person can prove God’s existence philosophically.</i> He added, <i>who brought thee out of the land of Egypt</i> (v. 2) so that the intelligent and the non-intelligent<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">151</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The non-intelligent person has to be shown tangible proof of God’s existence. I.E. here takes issue with a contemporary, Rabbi Judah Ha-Levi, who felt that philosophical proof of God’s existence is insufficient for a truly spiritual life. See Book 1 of the <i>Kuzari.</i></i> would understand. God added, <i>thy God,</i> meaning, you are obligated to serve me, that is, to be My servant and to be My people, and I will be your God, because <i>I…brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>). The aforementioned was explained by Moses in the chapter that opens with the words <i>When thy son asketh</i> (Deut. 6:20.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">152</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which the Lord our God hath commanded you?</i></i> The meaning of the question<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">153</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The son’s question.</i> is: why are we, more than any other nation, obligated to observe God’s commandments? Have we not all one creator?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">154</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Malachi 2:10.</i> Moses gave three answers.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">155</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To the son’s question.</i> The first one is, <i>We were Pharaoh’s bondmen in Egypt</i> (Deut. 6:21) and God did all these good things<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">156</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Which are recorded in Deut. 6:21-23.</i> for us. We are therefore obligated, even if we do not know the reason for His commandments, to observe everything that God commands us to do. The second one is, God did not decree the commandments to us because of His own needs but rather <i>for our good always</i> (Deut. 6:24). The third is, <i>And it shall be righteousness unto us;</i> that is, we will be righteous people and thus merit the world to come <i>if we observe to do all this commandment before the Lord our God, as He hath commanded us</i> (Deut. 6:25). The philosophers have discovered that there are ten aspects relating to that which is corporeal.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">157</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The ten Aristotelian predicates. They are: Essence, Quantity, Quality, Relation, Place, Time, Position, State, Activity, Passivity. See page 37 in <i>Essays in Logic; From Aristotle to Russell,</i> selected and edited by Ronald Jager, Prentis Hall, Englewood Cliffs, 1963.</i> They are primary categories. There is nothing above them. The first pertains to a thing’s essence. It is everlasting. The other nine are accidents. They depend on the first, are joined to it, and result from it. The first is like the number one in the number ten, for the entire sum<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">158</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, 10.</i> came out of number one and all sums are found in it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">159</sup><i class=\"footnote\">All sums are made out of the number one.</i> One is the foundation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">160</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Of all numbers.</i> Now the first statement uttered by God the glorious includes all precepts directed at the heart, tongue, and human deeds. For one who does not believe in his heart that God exists has no commandments upon him. A person is obligated to mention God’s name every moment, to honor Him. Everything a person does,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">161</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reference is apparently to the observance of the positive commandments.</i> he must do only for the glory of God. A person should<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">162</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Similarly.</i> not keep from violating a negative precept except out of regard for God’s glory. For example, a man who gives charity to the poor should not give it out of respect for the collector, nor so that people should praise him. For if this is the case, then a human being’s status is more important in his eyes than the glory of God, who gave him wealth and abundance of money from which he can give charity and receive a reward from God. The same applies to one who trespasses in secret so that<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">163</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He thinks.</i> his sin will not become known to the king, or people see him and come to consider him a shameful person. One who thinks thus<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">164</sup><i class=\"footnote\">With regard to God.</i> is insane, for it is written, <i>He that planted the ear, shall He not hear</i> (Ps. 94:9). Now God sees the hidden things. He sees what people cannot openly see. God knows each one’s thoughts and his secrets. Now a person is afraid of the king<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">165</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And hence does not publicly violate his laws.</i> who will die on the next day and not punish him, and does not fear the True King in whose hands is his soul in this world and in the next world.

                "The Gaon, Rabbi Saadiah composed <i>azharot</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">166</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Liturgical poems devoted to the enumeration of 613 commandments. The name is derived from the initial word of the first composition of this nature, viz., <i>Exhortations</i> (azharot) <i>didst Thou give to Thy people of old. Azharot</i> is numerically equivalent to 613 (Roth, <i>Standard Jewish Encyclopedia</i>). See <i>Taryag</i> by Abraham Hirsch Rabinowitz, Boys Town Jerusalem Publishing, Jerusalem, 1967, pp. 41-60.</i> He encompassed all the commandments<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">167</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Torah.</i> in these Ten Statements.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">168</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Saadiah was the first to do so (Rabinowitz). According to Saadiah the first statement takes in 80 precepts, the second 60, the third 48, the fourth 78, the fifth 77, the sixth 50, the seventh 88, the eighth 52, the ninth 52, and the tenth 54.</i> We find<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">169</sup><i class=\"footnote\">So <i>Vat. Ebr.</i> 38. The printed editions read: and they found.</i> God’s name<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">170</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>YHVH.</i></i> in the first five statements.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">171</sup><i class=\"footnote\">But not in the last five. I.E. will soon go on to explain why.</i> I have already explained that the first statement is the foundation upon which all the commandments rest. It is followed by <i>Thou shalt have no other gods.</i> The sin of the one who does not believe in God is greater than the sin of the one who worships idols. For there are many who believe in the Lord and offer sacrifices to idols, like those who offered to the queen of heaven, because they think that it can help them. As the verse says, <i>But since we let off to offer to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto her, we have wanted all things</i> (Jer. 44:18). Scripture also reads, <i>They feared the Lord, and served their own gods</i> (II Kings 17:33). We find the same with Naaman who said, <i>when I prostrate myself in the house of Rimmon</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">172</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rimmon was a pagan god.</i> <i>the Lord pardon thy servant in this thing</i> (II Kings 5:18). Now all of the above-mentioned believe in the Lord. However, they join another with Him. It is for this reason that the name of the revered God is written in this statement.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">173</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For only <i>YHVH</i> may be worshipped.</i> God’s name is also written in the third statement, for swearing falsely is less of a sin than idolatry.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">174</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hence it is mentioned in the third statement rather than in the second.</i> Nevertheless, one who does this publicly shames the Lord. It is possible that the violator acts in this manner out of anger or need, for he believes in his heart in God and does not worship any deity along with the Lord.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">175</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hence the violator is not considered an atheist and does not fall under the purview of the first statement. I.E. comments thus because one might assume that a person who swears falsely and invokes God’s name does not believe in the Lord.</i> The fourth statement tells us that the Lord<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">176</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hence the use of the name <i>YHVH.</i></i> rested on the seventh day. Thus he who does work on the Sabbath denies that God created the world. Now this sin is less severe than taking the name of the Lord in vain. The Lord’s name is written in the fifth statement because parents are God’s partners in the creation of a human being. If a person does not honor his parents, it is as if he is not honoring God. The five remaining statements deal with sins against a fellow human being.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">177</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hence God’s name is not mentioned there.</i> The first one is the most heinous, namely, causing the soul to separate from the body. This is followed by the rape of the body.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">178</sup><i class=\"footnote\">So <i>Vat. Ebr.</i> 38 and the parallel in I.E.’s short commentary. The printed editions read: this is followed by “not (<i>enam</i>) in the body.” <i>Enam</i> is obviously an error for <i>ones</i> (rape). I.E. interprets <i>lo tinaf</i> (thou shalt not commit adultery) as thou shalt not rape, because it is positioned between thou shalt not murder and thou shalt not steal, both of which are acts of violence. In the short commentary he interprets <i>lo tinaf</i> thus: do not take by force what belongs to someone else, i.e., someone’s wife; do not take by force that which is independent, i.e., an unmarried women, or that which is not human; i.e., do not practice bestiality.</i> Next comes, Thou shalt not steal money. Afterwards comes stealing with the tongue. Next comes coveting with one’s heart."

Scripture speaks from the point of view of the idol worshipper.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">179</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Scripture speaks of other gods only from the point of view of their worshippers, as there is no God other than the Lord.</i> It is similar to <i>Then Hananiah the prophet</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">180</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hananiah was a false prophet; that is, he was not a prophet.

                "[BEFORE ME.]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">184</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, before My face.

Similarly, <i>and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest’s office before the face of Aaron their father</i> <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">186</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Translated literally.</i> (Num. 3:4). The meaning of our verse thus is, it is unseemly for you to worship any other god along with Me since I am your God and am always with you and see what you do. One of the wise men once said, “Do not anger your master when he sees you.” Now this commandment, namely, <i>Thou shalt have no other gods</i> is directed to the heart and to the mouth, for aside from this precept there is no other negative commandment in the Torah directed to the heart.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">187</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Actually there are, such as <i>Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart…Thou shalt not…bear any grudge</i> (Lev. 19:17,18). What I.E. probably meant was, there is no negative commandment directed at the heart i n the Torah for the violation of which one is punished by a court with death or stripes, with the exception of <i>Thou shalt have no other gods before me.</i></i> If a man says in the presence of witnesses that he intends to murder or commit adultery, he will not be executed for what he said as long as he does not commit any act. However, Scripture states concerning anyone who says, <i>Let us go and serve other gods</i> (Deut. 13:7), <i>but thou shalt surely kill him</i> (Deut. 13:10). On the other hand, the statement <i>Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image</i> (v. 4) deals with an act. It prohibits the making of a graven image out of wood or stone. It prohibits making any manner of likeness of anything that is in the heavens by any sort of means. Scripture uses the term <i>above</i> because the heavens are above the earth on all sides. There are no likenesses in the heavens except for the forty-eight forms.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">188</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Forty-eight groupings of stars, such as the lion, the bear, etc.</i> Those who are wise about the forms do things that are wrong.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">189</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They act incorrectly.

This is also the opinion of the Talmud, <i>San.</i> 27b.</i> <i>Poked</i> (visiting) has the same meaning as <i>zokher</i> (remembering).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">199</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, <i>poked avon avot</i> (visiting the iniquities of the fathers) means remembering the sins of the fathers.</i> Compare, <i>And the Lord visited</i> (pakad) <i>Sarah</i> (Gen. 21:1).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">200</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Translated literally.</i> which is another way of saying, and the Lord remembered (<i>va-yizkor</i>) Sarah. God is patient with the wicked because it is possible that he will repent and bear a son who is better than he. Now if the son walks in the footsteps of his father and so do the third and fourth generations, then God will not be patient and withhold his anger from the fourth generation. If all of them until four generations are enemies of God, then they will all perish in the fourth generation. For God will remember what the father did, what the son did, and what the grandson did. Hence he will not keep his anger in check when it comes to the fourth generation. Grandchildren are considered as children.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">201</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus <i>upon the children</i> is short for upon the children and upon the grandchildren. See Ex. 34:7.</i> Hence Scripture employed a shortened form.

Some people think this represents a problem.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">205</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Scripture here promises that God will show mercy unto thousands of generations, whereas in Deuteronomy He promises to show mercy <i>to a thousand generations.</i></i> However, it does not, for Scripture reads as follows: if you will observe My commandments then God will keep the covenant and the mercy which He swore unto your ancestors, that is, to the three patriarchs.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">206</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To a thousand generations.</i> This is the meaning of <i>who keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love Him and keep His commandments to a thousand generations</i> (Deut. 7:9). However this chapter deals with another matter. Scripture here states, <i>and showing mercy to thousands</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">207</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Of generations.</i> Its meaning is, without end, namely, forever. This can be explained in two ways. One, God shows mercy to those who love Him by granting everlasting existence to their souls so that they remain alive for thousands upon thousands of years. Two, that God will eternally show mercy to their offspring who are like them. David similarly said, <i>But the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear Him, And His righteousness unto children’s children</i> (Ps. 103:17). Now there is no doubt that God’s mercy is eternally upon those who fear Him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">208</sup><i class=\"footnote\">What need then is there for Scripture to state, <i>of them that love Me and keep My commandments?</i></i> It is only because Scripture mentions the children’s children,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">209</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They are alluded to in <i>unto the thousandth generation.</i></i> in keeping with <i>And His righteousness endureth for ever</i> (Ps. 111:3), that Scripture has to explain that this only applies if the children are good. Scripture therefore says that this is so only in regard to those who keep God’s covenant. When I comment upon the Torah portion <i>Ki Tissa,</i> I will explain to you why the attribute of visiting the sins of the fathers is to be counted among the attributes of mercy.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">210</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See I.E. on Ex. 34:7.</i>",

For a murderer cannot commit murder, nor an adulterer adultery, both of which are major sins, whenever they want to because they are afraid of being caught. However, the person who is the habit of swearing falsely will daily utter innumerable vows. Such a person is so accustomed to committing this sin that he is not even aware that he is taking an oath. Should someone chide him and say to him, “Why are you swearing?” he responds by swearing that he did not swear, because he is so habituated to swearing.

Likewise the thief who finds pleasures for his needs, and the false witness who does so to gain favor or revenge.

The meaning of <i>to keep it holy</i> is explained by what follows, namely, <i>Six days shalt thou labor.</i> Scripture similarly explains the meaning of <i>and hallowed it</i> (v. 11) by going on to say that God rested on the seventh day from all of His work. The reason the sanctification of the Sabbath is here connected to <i>the Lord blessed</i> [<i>the sabbath day</i>], as it is in the chapter opening with the words <i>were finished</i> (Gen. 2:1), is that God sanctified this day and prepared it so that the souls<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">229</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Of those who observe the Sabbath.</i> would receive an infusion of wisdom above that of the other days.

However, it is only right that he separate himself on the Sabbath and rest for the sake of God’s glory. He should not occupy himself with vanity by spending his time seeking advice, even if it concerns his past needs. He should similarly not seek counsel about what he should do in the future. The prophet similarly said, <i>Nor pursuing thy business,</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">238</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On the Sabbath.</i> <i>nor speaking thereof</i> (Is. 58:13).

However, such an individual does not deny the existence of God the revered.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">240</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hence the prohibition to violate the Sabbath is not subsumed in the first of the Ten Statements.</i> There can be no doubt that the word <i>thou</i> includes all those who are obligated to observe the commandments.

Scripture tells us that we are obligated to guard them<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">241</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On the Sabbath.</i> lest they do anything on the Sabbath that we are prohibited from doing.

Now just as a man does not desire to sleep with his mother, although she be beautiful, because he has been trained from his childhood to know that she is prohibited to him, so must every intelligent person know that a person does not acquire a beautiful woman or money because of his intelligence or wisdom, but only in accordance with what God has apportioned to him. Indeed, Koheleth states, <i>yet to a man that hath not labored therein shall he leave it for his portion</i> (Eccles. 2:21). Furthermore, our sages taught, children, life, and sustenance are not dependent upon a person’s merits but upon the stars.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">277</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Mo’ed Katan</i> 28a.</i> The intelligent person will therefore neither desire nor covet. Once he knows that God has prohibited his neighbor’s wife to him she will be more exalted in his eyes than the princess is in the eyes of the peasant. He will therefore be happy with his lot and will not allow his heart to covet and desire anything which is not his. For he knows that that which God did not want to give him, he cannot acquire by his own strength, thoughts, or schemes. He will therefore trust in his creator, that is, that his creator will sustain him and do what is right in His sight. Observe, we have completed explaining the Ten Statements.

I will now explain. Saadiah Gaon says that there is a difference of opinion concerning the altar that Moses built beneath Mount Sinai.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">333</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ex. 24:4.</i> Some say that he built the altar before the giving of the Torah. Others maintain that he built it afterwards. The Gaon agrees with the first opinion. He says that what Scripture records in this chapter, namely, the chapter which contains the words <i>All that the Lord hath spoken we will do</i> (Ex. 19:8), is repeated in the second chapter, that is, in the chapter that reads, <i>All that the Lord hath spoken will we do, and obey</i> (Ex. 24:7).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">334</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We thus see that they refer to the same event.</i> I will prove to you conclusively that Moses built the altar after the giving of the Torah. This chapter clearly states that God told Moses, when he went up to the mountain of God prior to the giving of the Torah, <i>Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians…Now therefore, if ye will hearken unto My voice</i> (Ex. 19:4, 5). God started by saying, <i>Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob</i> (Ex. 19:3). Now Moses did not relate<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">335</sup><i class=\"footnote\">At that time.</i> any commandments, statutes, or ordinances to Israel. He merely wanted to hear from their very lips whether they wanted to listen to God’s voice and do what He commanded them. Israel replied by saying, <i>we will do</i> (Ex. 19:8). Scripture then goes on to report, <i>And Moses told the words of the people unto the Lord</i> (Ex. 19:9). Moses then sanctified Israel so that they would be fit to hear God’s word, which consisted of the Ten Statements. He now<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">336</sup><i class=\"footnote\">After the Ten Statements were revealed.</i> started to instruct the people in God’s commandments. When Moses approached the thick darkness God told him everything stated in the section that begins, <i>Ye shall not make with Me</i> (v. 20)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">337</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, verses 20-23.</i> and the entire chapter of <i>Now these are the ordinances</i> (Ex. 21:1) up to, <i>for they will be a snare unto thee</i> (Ex. 23:33). Scripture then tells us, <i>And Moses came</i> (Ex. 24:3); that is, he came down from the mountain. Scripture then goes on to state, <i>and</i> [<i>Moses</i>] <i>told the people all the words of the Lord and all the ordinances</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>). <i>The words of the Lord</i> refers to the positive and negative commandments, starting with <i>Ye shall not make with Me—gods of silver</i> (v. 20); the account of the altar and all the positive and negative commandments found in the chapter that begins, <i>And these are the Ordinances,</i> such as <i>thou shalt surely bring it back to him again</i> (Ex. 23:4); <i>thou shalt restore it unto him by that the sun goeth down</i> (Ex. 22:25), and <i>Thou shalt not revile God</i> (Ex. 22:27). The ordinances refer to the laws dealing with slavery, assault, fights, goring, arson, theft, oaths. It is concerning these that Scripture there writes, <i>and all the ordinances</i> (Ex. 24:3). It is concerning these laws that our forefathers said, <i>will we do, and obey</i> (Ex. 24:7). The meaning of <i>will we do</i> is, we will observe the positive and the negative commandments. The meaning of <i>and obey</i> is: we will obey the ordinances. The Israelites therefore added <i>and obey,</i> something which they at first<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">338</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Before the revelation of the Ten Statements.</i> did not say<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">339</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ex. 19:8.</i> following the giving of the Torah. The meaning of <i>An altar of earth</i> clearly is, as the phrase implies, an altar made out of earth. This is what Scripture refers to when it writes later, <i>and builded an altar under the mount</i> (Ex. 24:4). Scripture here writes, <i>and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt-offerings, and thy peace-offerings</i> (v. 21), and it is there written, [and they] <i>offered burnt-offerings, and sacrificed peace-offerings</i> (Ex. 24:5).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">340</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We thus see that the altar mentioned here and the altar mentioned in Ex. 24:5 were built for the same purpose. This supports I.E.’s contention that the reference is to the same altar.</i> There is no doubt that the section beginning, <i>An altar of earth</i> and also <i>Ye shall not make with Me</i> (v. 20) were stated because of the blood of the covenant which Moses dashed on the altar (Ex. 24:6) and because the people pledged that the Lord alone would be their God and that they would observe His commandments and ordinances (Ex. 24:7). Scripture mentions, <i>thy sheep, and thine oxen</i> (v. 21) because both of them are kinds of animals from which burnt offerings and peace offerings may be brought.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">341</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These were the offerings brought by Moses after God’s revelation to Israel.</i> I saw a heretic, may his bones be crushed, arguing against the sages of the Talmud for saying, <i>Which was the place appointed for the sacrifices</i> (<i>Zevachim</i> 5:1).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">342</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chapter 5 of tractate <i>Zevachim</i> deals with the place set aside for the various sacrifices.

The burnt offering is an entity unto itself, and sacrifices refer only to peace offerings, as in [and they] <i>offered burnt-offerings, and sacrificed peace-offerings of oxen unto the Lord</i> (Ex. 24:5). We<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">344</sup><i class=\"footnote\">So argued the heretic.</i> find this to be the case all over. Now I showed this heretic that what he said was incorrect.

Abraham was known as Abraham the Hebrew (Gen. 14:13).

They are to be understood in the same way.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As Hebrew slaves, that is, as people descended from Abraham.</i> Their proof is from <i>the wife and her children</i> (v. 4),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Who remain in slavery.

The reference is to the term <i>ivri</i> (Hebrew).</i> If the Hebrew slave is not an Israelite, then why did Scripture state, <i>If thy brother, a Hebrew man…be sold unto thee</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse continues, <i>he shall serve thee six years; and in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee</i>. Thus Deut. 15:12 and our verse refer to the same type of servant. Now if the term Hebrew does not refer to an Israelite, why does Scripture use the term brother? Brother refers only to an Israelite. If Deut. 15:12 referred to a non-Israelite it should have read, “If a Hebrew man be sold unto thee.” We thus see that our verse refers to an Israelite.</i> (Deut. 15:12)? Do we not know that brother in <i>Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart</i> (Lev. 19:17) means an Israelite? It is the same case with <i>between a man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him</i> (Deut. 1:16).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is clear that brother refers to an Israelite, for <i>brother</i> stands in contrast to <i>stranger</i>.</i> There are many such cases. Now there is no doubt that the meaning of <i>Abram the Hebrew</i> (Gen. 14:13) is: Abram of the children of Eber, about whom Scripture says <i>avi kol bene ever</i>, (the father of all the children of Eber) (Gen. 10:21),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Any descendants of Eber who accept the teaching of Eber is called an <i>ivri</i>. See I.E.’s comments on v. 8.</i> in contrast to <i>and Ham is the father of Canaan</i> (Gen. 9:18). On the other hand, it is possible that Abram was called the Hebrew because he came from beyond the river,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew word for beyond is <i>ever</i>. See Josh. 24:2, <i>Your fathers dwelt of old time beyond the River</i> (be-ever ha-nahar). According to this interpretation, Abraham was called the <i>ivri</i> because he came from beyond (<i>ever</i>) the river.</i> although in this case the term used should have been <i>ivri nahari</i> <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew word for river is <i>nahar</i>.</i> rather than <i>ivri</i>. Let us assume that Scripture was being brief,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, <i>ivri</i> is short for <i>ivri nahari</i>.</i> because we find that the Bible states, <i>And I took your father Abraham from beyond the River</i> (me-ever ha-nahar) (Josh. 24:3).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The point is, anyone acquainted with the Bible will know that <i>ivri</i> is short for <i>ivri nahari</i>.</i> The Hebrews are also called Israelites, for we see that Moses told Pharaoh, <i>Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel</i> (Ex. 5:1). However, when Pharaoh asked Moses, “Who is this God?”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.E.’s paraphrase of <i>Who is the Lord</i>?

See Num. 20:14.</i> The same applies to <i>Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite, for he is thy brother</i> (Deut. 23:8)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, Edom is not here referred to as a brother in commandments.</i> wherein Scripture mentions <i>he is thy brother</i> after first mentioning the term <i>Edomite</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, <i>brother</i> in Deut. 23:8 explains why we are not to hate an Edomite. It does not mean that he is our brother in commandments.</i> The same is true of <i>Because he</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Edom.</i><i> did pursue his brother</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Israel.</i> <i>with the sword</i> (Amos 1:11).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This verse does not imply that Edom and Israel are brothers in <i>mitzvot</i>.</i> Now we do not find in all of Scripture the word Hebrew employed except in regard to the children of Jacob. Scripture thus states: <i>And there was with us there a young man, a Hebrew</i> (Gen. 41:12); <i>because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews</i> (Gen. 43:32); <i>an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew</i> (Ex. 2:11); <i>two men of the Hebrews were striving together</i> (Ex. 2:13). Jonah said, <i>I am a Hebrew</i> (Jonah 1:9) because he was asked, <i>and of what people art thou</i> (Jonah v. 1:8). If the term Hebrew had referred to many nations, Jonah would not yet have told them of what people he was.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">By saying <i>I am a Hebrew</i>, he might be saying I am an Edomite, or a Moabite, or the like.</i> Scripture also states, <i>that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews</i> (I Sam. 4:9);<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reference there is clearly to that of an Israelite.</i> <i>Now the Hebrews</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reference is to Israelites.</i> <i>that were with the Philistines</i> (I Sam. 14:21). The book of Jeremiah states: <i>that every man should let his man-servant, and every man his maid-servant, being a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman, go free</i> (Jer. 34:9). The latter closes by explaining, <i>that none should make bondmen of them, even of a Jew his brother</i> (<i>Ibid</i>.). Now it is known that an Edomite is not called a Jew.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hence the term Hebrew in Jer. 34:9 cannot apply to him. I.E. notes this because he had earlier noted that Scripture refers to the Edomites as brothers.</i> Those who disagree with our sages say, look, it is written: <i>And many from among the peoples of the land became Jews</i> (mityahadim) (Esther 8:17)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We thus see that the term Jew can be applied to someone who is not born a Jew. Hence the term Jew in Jer. 34:9 may also apply to a non-Jew, that is, to a non-Jewish slave who observes some of the commandments (Filwarg).</i> in reference to those who were not Jews. This is blindness. For according to their opinion, whether the meaning of the word <i>mityahadim</i> (became Jews) is that they claimed to be Jews or that <i>mityahadim</i> means they accepted Judaism,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to I.E., <i>mityahadim</i> means: praised the Jews.</i> Scripture should have read, “even of one of his brothers who became Jewish.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jer. 34:9 refers to the man-servant as a <i>yehudi</i>, a Jew. If the reference was to those not born Jewish, i.e., slaves who belong to Jews and practice Judaism, then the term used should have been <i>mityahed</i>, acting Jewish.</i> Furthermore, the word <i>mitabber</i> (becoming a Hebrew)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is no Hebrew word with this meaning.</i> should be formed from the word <i>ivri</i> according to this interpretation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If the word <i>mityahed</i> means to claim to be Jewish or to become a Jew, then a parallel form, <i>mitabber</i>, should exist. However, it does not.</i> One who says this, <i>meddleth</i> (mitabber) <i>with strife not his own</i> (Prov. 26:17).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.E. plays on the word <i>mitabber</i>.</i> It has thus been clearly shown that the words of our sages are correct. We will rely upon them with regard to all of the commandments in accordance with their tradition, which they received from their fathers. Furthermore, how can one think that an Ishmaelite and an Edomite shall serve for six years<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As outlined in our verse.</i> and an Israelite until the year of jubilee.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Lev. 25:39, which states that an Israelite serves till the year of jubilee.

Rabbi Merinus says that the <i>yod</i> of the word <i>la-chofshi</i> (tree) is superfluous.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">64</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, <i>la-chofshi</i> (free) has the same meaning as <i>la-chofesh</i> (unto freedom).

However, if we speak of graded punishments, then it is logical to distinguish between the two.</i> However, their<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">231</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The heretics.</i> real difficulty lies in accepting the idea that the master would be executed because of the death of a bondman.

Why didn’t Scripture specify what greater or lesser vengeance is to be exacted?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">232</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If, as the heretics claim, Scripture speaks of graded punishments, then it should have stated what these punishments consist of.</i> Let us now pursue what is written in Scripture. Scripture states, <i>nekom nikmat bene yisrael</i> (avenge the children of Israel) (Num. 31:2). It then goes on to tell us that all the Midianites were killed. Note that Samson said, <i>ki im nikkamti ba-khem</i> (surely I will be avenged of you) (Jud. 15:7). It then states, <i>And he smote them hip [and thigh with a great slaughter</i>] (Jud. 15:8).

It then goes on to say, <i>To execute vengeance</i> (nikamah) <i>upon the nations</i> (Ps. 149:7). The Bible states, <i>For he doth avenge</i> (yikkom) <i>the blood of his servants</i> (Deut. 32:43). Now blood indicates slaughter.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">234</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus to avenge the blood of his servants means to kill those who slaughtered his servants.</i> This is the way the term<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">235</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Nekamah</i> (vengeance).</i> is always used. The reason Scripture here refers to execution by vengeance is that a master seeks excuses to fall upon his bondman because he is in his power,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">236</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The master thinks that the slave has no one to avenge him and thus abuses his slave. Hence Scripture states the death of an innocent slave must be avenged.</i> as he cannot smite a fellow Israelite.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">237</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Who is his slave, for he fears the slave’s family who will avenge him.</i> Now let us turn to Scripture’s statement a <i>day or two</i>. Observe that the latter is like <i>At the mouth of two witnesses</i> [<i>or three witnesses</i>] (Deut. 17:6).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">238</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Scripture tells us that capital cases require two or three witnesses. Now if two witnesses are sufficient to establish the fact, why mention three?</i> They<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">239</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The above-noted heretics.</i> said that they do not know its meaning.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">240</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Why Scripture reads, <i>or three witnesses</i>, if two witnesses are sufficient.</i> Let them put our verse along with it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">241</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As they do not understand the reason for <i>or three witnesses</i>, so do they not understand the reason for <i>or two</i> (days).</i> Our sages of blessed memory said that the meaning of <i>a day or two</i> is that the hours shall add up to the twenty-four of a day.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">242</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <i>Mekhilta</i> on this verse: “A <i>day</i> means one that is as long as two days, and <i>two</i> means two days that are as long as one. How so? A twenty-four hour period.” Also see Rashi: “A day which is made up of a part of two separate days, i.e. twenty-four hours calculated from any moment” (Rashi, paraphrased by Cohen).</i> Now when we examined the verse we found that Scripture says, “with the rod,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">243</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the literal meaning of <i>ba-shevet</i>. See note 213.</i> the reference being to the disciplining rod, as in <i>Thou beatest him with the rod</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">244</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hebrew, <i>ba-shevet</i>.</i> (Prov. 23:14). It is thus clear that the master wanted to punish the bondman. Scripture did not mention what the laws are regarding a master who kills his bondman,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">245</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When not disciplining him. According to Rashbam the master is put to death in such cases even if the servant lives beyond two days.</i> because a master normally takes pity on the bondman, whom he owns, and refrains from killing him even as he takes pity upon his cattle. Now God commanded that a master shall not act sadistically when he punishes his bondman. When he sees the bondman dying under his rod the master shall let him be. If he does not leave the bondman alone then he will be put to death on the bondman’s account, for God’s mercy is upon all of His creatures. Indeed, concerning David we read, <i>Thou hast shed blood abundantly</i> (I Chron. 22:8).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">246</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reason David was not permitted to build the temple.</i> The reference was to non-Israelite blood.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">247</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We thus see that the blood of all people is precious in the sight of God.</i>"

It is because of this that Scripture afterwards states, <i>Whether it have gored a son, or gored a daughter</i> (v. 31). The law concerning one that smiteth a man applies equally whether the victim is an adult or a minor.

This commentator interprets the verse as: Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest has been long on the vine. <i>Lo tevashel gedi bachalev immo</i> similarly means: Do not leave the kid so that it continues to nurse its mother milk.</i> However, the term <i>bashel</i> means to seethe,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">101</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Not to leave, or prolong its stay.</i> for the sun seethes like fire.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">102</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus <i>bashel katzir</i> literally means the harvest has been seethed, i.e., ripened.</i> It is the same case with <i>hivshilu</i> (ripe)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">103</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Hivshilu</i> literally means they caused it to cook.</i> in <i>and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes</i> (Gen. 40:10). Rabbi Solomon<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">104</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi. This is also the opinion of the Talmud.

He claims that the phrase <i>gedi izzim</i> (a kid of the goats) (Gen. 38:17) proves this, since there is no reason to connect them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">105</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, to connect <i>gedi</i> to <i>izzim</i>. In other words, if <i>gedi</i> means a young goat, then Gen. 38:17 should have read <i>gedi</i>, not <i>gedi izzim</i>, for <i>gedi izzim</i> means a young goat of the goats.

Thus in Arabic<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">106</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A cognate of Hebrew.</i> the term <i>gedi</i> means a goat. It is never used for any other kind.

See <i>Hullin</i> 113b.</i> I will now explain.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">109</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The meaning of <i>Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother’s milk</i> and the Rabbinic tradition based on it, regarding the prohibition of eating meat and milk.</i> Note that it is the Torah’s custom to speak of that which is most prevalent. For example, the Torah refers to the ostrich as a <i>bat ha-ya’anah</i> (Lev. 11:16).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">110</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, the daughter of wailing. In Leviticus chapter 11, the Torah lists the animals which may or may not be eaten. The only species which is referred to as a <i>bat</i> is the ostrich.</i> Now why does the Torah do something here which it does not do in any other place? For in no other place does the Torah refer to an entire species by the term “daughter of” (<i>bat</i>). Note that the flesh of the <i>ya’anah</i> is as dry as wood. It is not customary for people to eat it, as it contains no moisture. The only flesh of this species that is eaten is that of the “daughter” (<i>bat</i>), whose flesh has a little moisture in it because it is a young female.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">111</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Torah refers to an ostrich as a <i>bat</i> because that is the type of ostrich that is usually eaten by those who eat ostriches.</i> However, young ostrich males have no moisture in them. Similarly, people do not eat meat and milk, for it is not pleasant to do so. Meat takes long to cook, but milk boils quickly.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">112</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.E. believed that food that does not cook equally should not be prepared in the same pot.</i> It is not the custom even today in the land of the Ishmaelites for a person to eat a lamb cooked in milk because the lamb is very moist and so is milk. It is thus harmful.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">113</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to medieval medicine there are four humors: dry, hot, moist, and dry. An imbalance of these humors was thought to cause illness.</i> Hence it is not eaten. On the other hand, the flesh of the kid contains no moisture. When a goat is small it is hot.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">114</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And cooks quickly.</i> Therefore they [inhabitants of Ishmaelite lands] cook the kid with milk. Do not be surprised that the people of the surrounding areas are not in the habit of eating a kid of the goats.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">115</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.E. took pains to point out that the fact that people did not eat kid meat in the area where he wrote his commentary does not negate his earlier point. He had explained that the reason Scripture reads, <i>Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother’s milk</i>, rather than “thou shalt not seethe meat in milk” was that people do the former and not the latter. People do not refrain from eating goat’s meat because of health reasons. They do so because of local idiosyncrasies.</i> All the physicians admit that there is no comparable meat, and they even permit the sick to eat it. They similarly eat it in Spain, Africa, the Land of Israel, Persia, and Babylonia. It was similarly the custom of the ancients to eat it. We thus read: <i>two good kids of the goats</i> (Gen. 27:9); <i>that we may make ready a kid for thee</i> (Jud. 13:15). We also find that the <i>kohen</i> eats the kid of the goats that is brought as a sin offering (Lev. 6:19; 23:19,20). It is because it is not the custom for a person to eat raw meat that the Torah prohibited a person from cooking a kid in its mother’s milk.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">116</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.E. is explaining why Scripture prohibited a kid cooked with milk but did not prohibit the eating of raw kid meat and milk.</i> Some say that <i>bishul</i> (seething) only applies to meat roasted over a fire.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">117</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hence <i>lo tivashel</i> (thou shalt not seethe) means thou shalt not roast.</i> However, is it not written, <i>u-vasel mevushal bamayim</i> (sodden…with water) (Ex. 12:9)? We similarly find that the Book of Chronicles states <i>bi-shelu ba-sirot</i> (sod they in pots) (II Chron. 35:13). There is no need for us to search for the reason it is prohibited.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">118</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To seethe a kid in its mother’s milk.</i> The reason is hidden from the eyes of the intelligent. It is possible that it is prohibited to seethe a kid in its mother’s milk because to do so is very cruel. The idea behind this law is like the idea behind <i>And whether it be cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and its young both in one day</i> (Lev. 22:28), and <i>thou shalt not take the dam with the young</i> (Deut. 22:6). It is the practice of most people that do not have a flock to buy milk in the market.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">119</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If the reason for the prohibition of seething a kid in its mother’s milk is cruelty, then the prohibition applies only to its own mother’s milk and to no one else’s. I.E. thus wants to explain why it is prohibited to seethe a kid in any milk that is purchased.</i> In such a case the milk usually consists of a mixture coming from many goats. It is possible for the buyer of a kid not to know where the mother is.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">120</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He would know which animal is its mother only if the kid was born in his house.</i> Now if the one who has bought a kid later buys milk, it is possible that some of this milk contains milk from the mother of the kid which he previously purchased. He will then violate the law.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">121</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If he cooks the kid in the milk which he has newly purchased.</i> We must be strict when in doubt regarding a Biblical law.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">122</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hence one is not permitted to cook a kid in any milk that was purchased.</i> The Ishmaelites also admit that if one cooks a kid in its mother’s milk the resulting dish tastes better because the mother and the kid are similar in nature. Scripture speaks of what is most usual. The ancients of blessed memory were strict in order to remove all doubt.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">123</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That one never accidentally seethe a kid in its mother’s milk.</i> They thus prohibited meat and milk.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">124</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They prohibited seething a kid in the milk of an animal which is not its mother. They also prohibited having milk with any meat.</i> God who gave them wisdom will fully reward them.

However, man’s soul (<i>neshamah</i>), which is tied to the body,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">195</sup><i class=\"footnote\">During a person’s lifetime.</i> comes from on high. There are two powers that are intermediate between the body and the soul. These two powers are referred to in the main in Hebrew as <i>ru’ach</i> (spirit) and <i>nefesh</i> (life force, appetite, desire), for the soul (<i>neshamah</i>) is the rational part of man and its place is in the brain of man. From it comes the power of all emotions and the desire to move.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">196</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, the desire to move the body (Krinsky).</i> The <i>ru’ach</i> (spirit) is situated in the heart. Life depends on the <i>ru’ach</i>. The <i>ru’ach</i> desires to dominate; that is, it seeks to overcome all opposition. It is the source of anger. Solomon similarly said, <i>Be not hasty in thy spirit</i> (ruchakha) <i>to be angry</i> (Eccles. 7:9), and <i>A fool spendeth all his spirit</i> (rucho) (Prov. 29:11). The seat of the <i>nefesh</i> (life force, appetite, desire) is in the liver. It is the <i>nefesh</i> that desires to eat. It is thus written, <i>because thy soul</i> (nafshekha) <i>desires</i> (Deut. 12:20). The <i>nefesh</i> is the source of sexual desire. Now some people are created in such a way that these three souls are strong. In others they are weak. In other instances one soul is strong, another weak, or neither weak nor strong. Now, people fall into twenty-seven categories.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">197</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There are 27 possible combinations of the three souls, or powers, in their three possible states: strong, weak, and intermediary. See Krinsky and Filwarg.</i> God gave the Torah to strengthen, to intensify, and to increase the power of man’s supernal soul. When this happens the body does not rule over it. However, if the Torah is not observed, then the body overpowers the <i>neshamah</i>. I will explain<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">198</sup><i class=\"footnote\">How the soul can or cannot overcome the body’s desires.</i> with the following parable. We know from the teachings of the sciences that any person whose constitution is overcome by red bile will be angry, for this is the nature of fire<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">199</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is the nature of fire to consume. So too with anger, which takes over the body.</i> and red bile is like fire. Now when the <i>neshamah</i> is unintelligent it pursues the wants of the body because it cannot overcome its desires. Additionally, let us consider a person who is not by nature hot. If another person comes along and curses him to the point where he becomes angry, he begets heat in his body which was not there before he became angry. God the exalted, in his kindness, chose Israel and taught them His Torah. If Israel observes the Torah they become wise. Their wisdom guides them in a straight path to all things that will not harm them. The general rule is: the body must be subservient to the dictates of the soul (<i>neshamah</i>) rather than the soul being subservient to the dictates of the body. When the soul (<i>neshamah</i>) is strong, then the heavenly power known as nature, which preserves the body, grows in might. Now our verse tells us that God’s blessing shall be upon all our food and drink. For there is a curse that adversely effects the power of nature, as in <i>Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied</i> (Micah 6:14). Observe that all illnesses come from the food that enters the body. Now a person who observes the Torah will not fear them. This is the meaning of <i>and He will bless thy bread</i>. There are other diseases that come from outside the body due to a change in the air caused by a shift in the arrangement of the planets. It is concerning this that our verse states, <i>and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee</i>. Look, a person who observes the Torah has no need for a physician along with God the Revered. Scripture thus writes, <i>yet in his disease he sought not to the Lord, but to the physicians</i> (II Chron. 16:12). I have thus spoken on the science of medicine. I will now speak on the science dealing with the heavenly bodies. Note that what befalls human beings depends on the alignment of the planets and what their arrangement indicates at the time of a person’s birth. The aforementioned is extremely difficult to understand. If a woman is born under an arrangement that decrees she will not be able to carry her children to term, then it will be the nature of her womb to abort the children in it. The same is true if the woman is born under an arrangement that decrees that she be barren and not have children. Now if a person who is born under an arrangement of the planets that determines that he will have a physical makeup that is unable to beget children cleaves to God, then if he truly cleaves to God, the revered God will strengthen the power of this man’s kidneys and see to it that his sperm functions properly so that he will be able to have children. God therefore told Abraham, <i>I am God Almighty; walk before Me, and be thou whole-hearted</i> (Gen. 17:1). This is what the rabbis meant by “Cease thy planet gazing.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">200</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Sabbath</i> 156a (Soncino): “How do we know that Israel is immune from planetary influence?

Now we do not know whether our ancestors had a tradition that the Israelites took the acacia wood out of Egypt. If they did, then we will accept their tradition.

I.E. argues that <i>and two rings shall be on one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it</i> does not refer to the four rings mentioned in the first part of the clause.

Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> The word <i>ve-dibbarti</i> (and I will speak) is to be read as if written twice.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">194</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.E.’s point is that our verse is to be read as follows: and I will speak with thee from above the ark-cover, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of testimony, and I will further speak to you of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel.</i> Our verse is to be read as if written: and I will speak with thee from above the ark cover, from between the two cherubim. Scripture does not mention what will be spoken.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">195</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, part 2 of the verse does not tell us what part 1 of the verse refers to. This would not be the case if the word <i>et</i> did not have a <i>vav</i> before it. In the latter case, part 2 of the verse would go on to explain what God spoke to Moses about.</i> Its meaning is, I will speak with you in order to inform you of My secret and to answer your questions.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">196</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, part 1 deals with a private dialogue between God and Moses.</i> And I will speak to you of all the things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">197</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, part 1 deals with a private dialogue between God and Moses. Part 2 deals with the commandment which Moses was to transmit to Israel. Hence the connective <i>vav</i>.</i> We have reason to ask, why did God mention the ark first<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">198</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, why is the ark the first sacred item which Moses was commanded to make?</i> when Scripture reads, <i>the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the furniture thereof</i> (v. 9).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">199</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The tabernacle is mentioned first. Thus God should have told Moses to first construct a tabernacle and then to make the furniture which was to be placed therein.</i> The answer is that it is linguistic style to explain the last item with which one has closed.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">200</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A sentence.</i> Compare, <i>And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau; and I gave unto Esau mount Seir</i> (Josh. 24:4).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">201</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Scripture mentions Jacob before Esau. We would thus expect for Scripture to deal with Jacob before Esau. However, it goes on to deal with Esau. We thus see that Scripture elaborates first on what it dealt with last.</i> God therefore began with an explanation of the tabernacle’s furniture.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">202</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Because that is what is mentioned last in verse 9.</i> God started with the most important piece of furniture<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">203</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The ark.</i> and then went on to the explain the table and the menorah. After this, God said, <i>Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle</i> (Ex. 26:1). Now when Moses gathered the congregation he spoke to them about the tabernacle and the tent first.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">204</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ex. 35:1; 11.</i> Then he told them about the ark. There was no need for anyone to teach Moses.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">205</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As to how to construct the tabernacle. Krinsky claims that the reference is to the Midrash, which says that Bezalel took issue with Moses over what order to follow in constructing the tabernacle.</i> There is reason to wonder why God didn’t mention the altar of incense.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">206</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In our Torah portion. It is mentioned in Ex. 35:15. However, it should also have been mentioned here along with the other furniture that was placed inside the tabernacle.</i> The answer by way of parable is:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">207</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.E.’s point is that the tabernacle may be compared to a king’s palace. Indeed, Scripture states that the tabernacle served as a dwelling place for God, <i>let them make Me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them</i> (v. 8). Hence it had to be suitably furnished.</i> God’s glory did not depart [from the tabernacle].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">208</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, the tabernacle served, as it were, as God’s dwelling place.</i> The ark was therefore in the form of a throne.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">209</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For God, who dwelt there.</i> Observe, a menorah and a prepared table [were placed in the sanctuary].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">210</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They served to furnish God’s house. A table and a lamp were the typical furnishings of a house. See II Kings 4:10, “Let us make…a little chamber on the roof; and let us set…there…a table…and a candlestick.”.</i> God did not mention the altar of incense until He first mentioned the altar of the burnt offering, because God wanted to issue the command, <i>You shall offer no…burnt-offering, nor meal-offering; and ye shall pour no drink-offering thereon</i> (Ex. 30:9).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">211</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He couldn’t issue this command without first dealing with burnt offerings, meal offerings, or drink offerings.

Similarly with the glorious God. We know that God’s glory fills the world. However, there are places where God’s power is more manifest than in other places. This is so for the following two reasons. Divine manifestation varies in accordance with the natural makeup of the recipient and in accordance with the upper power that is above the receiver.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">285</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Some people and some places on earth are created in such a way that they are more open to God’s revelation than other people or places are. See I.E. on Gen. 28:16. This is also the opinion of Rabbi Judah ha-Levi. See Book II of the <i>Kuzari</i>.</i> Therefore, the place of the holy temple [Mount Moriah] was chosen.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">286</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Because it is under God’s special presence and open to it.</i> If God will give you wisdom, then you will understand the secret of the ark, the ark covering, and the cherubim which spread their wings.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">287</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The ark and the cherubim which were placed in the Holy of Holies represent God’s throne (Meijler). It is also possible that I.E. believed that the ark was constructed in such a way that it drew power from above and thus served to channel God’s word to Moses. See I.E. on Ex. 31:18.</i> You will also understand the secret of the objects which were placed outside of the curtain,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">288</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the tabernacle proper.</i> namely, the menorah, the incense altar, and the table.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">289</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They served, as it were, as furniture in God’s house (Meijler). It is also possible that I.E. held that in some mystical way they provided the physical conditions which made divine manifestation possible. See end of I.E.’s comment.</i> You will also comprehend the secret of the objects placed outside of the opening of the tabernacle, namely, the altar of the burnt offering and its utensils and the basin and its base. These objects served to honor God. I gave you these hints because there are many people in our generations who think they are wise. Perhaps they will mock my words. He who knows the secret of his soul and the makeup of his body is able to understand the workings of the upper world. This is so because man is a microcosm. Man was the last thing created by God when he created the earth. Let this serve as a sign: <i>He began with the largest</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">290</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The macrocosm.</i> <i>and finished with the youngest</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">291</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The microcosm.

This was also the case with the northern wall.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">77</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The southern and northern walls of the tabernacle consisted of 20 boards, each of which was 1 1/2 cubits in width.</i> Thus a space measuring eight cubits in width<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">78</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The tabernacle was 10 cubits in width. This can be ascertained from the size of the fabric and goats’ hair curtains which covered the tabernacle. These curtains were 28 and 30 cubits long.

I.E. believed that the tabernacle was 10 cubits in width and 30 in length only as measured from the outside.</i> However, eight boards<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">80</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See verses 22 and 23.</i> had to be placed there.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">81</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Each of which was 1 1/2 cubits wide. The question thus arises, how do we fit these boards into a space of 8 cubits? The width of each board was thus obviously not a cubit. I.E. will later explain that the space on the west measured about 10 cubits and that only six of the eight boards measured 1 1/2 cubits.</i> It is possible that the ancients were compelled to say that the boards were a cubit thick. They were compelled to say that the boards were a cubit thick because of the middle bar<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">82</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See verse 28. According to the Talmud this middle bar was inserted into the boards themselves.</i> which was inserted into the boards.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">83</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There are those who would emend to: It is possible they were compelled to say that the boards were a cubit thick because of the middle bar which was inserted into the boards (Krinsky). It should be noted that the text of this chapter appears to be especially corrupt due to the difficulty of understanding I.E.’s comments.</i> According to Rabbi Solomon<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">84</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi.</i> the bar could only lay there by a miracle.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">85</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to the Talmud <i>Sabbath</i> 98b, “It (the middle bar) lay there by miracle” (Soncino translation). Rashi in his comments on the Talmud explains that one long middle bar was placed into one of the boards and it miraculously snaked around all three sides of the tabernacle. This comment is not in our editions of Rashi on the Pentateuch. In our editions, Rashi merely notes that a separate middle bar was inserted into each of the three sides of the tabernacle. I.E. probably quoted Rashi from memory and attributed to him here what he wrote in his commentary on the Talmud.</i> According to the plain meaning of the text there were three middle bars.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">86</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, each had its own separate middle bar.</i> Scripture similarly writes, <i>from end to end</i> (v. 28).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">87</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The middle bar reached from end to end.</i> It does not state<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">88</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Which it would if one middle bar encircled all the sides of the tabernacle.</i> from end<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">89</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, from one end.</i> to the ends.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">90</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To all the other ends.</i> Now if the sages received a tradition that the boards were a cubit in thickness, then we will accept their tradition. However, if they arrived at this measurement by reasoning, then we can explain it differently. The two bars, namely, the upper two bars, and likewise the two lower bars,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">91</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Each wall of the tabernacle had five bars (v. 27). I.E. explains that there were two top bars, two bottom bars, and one middle bar.</i> reached half of the wall.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">92</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One of the top bars was placed along half the length of the walls of the tabernacle starting from one direction. Another was placed in the same position starting from the other side. They met in the center. The bottom bars were similarly placed. A middle bar which extended from one end to the other end was placed between the upper and lower bars.</i> The middle bar that was placed <i>in the midst</i> (be-tokh) <i>of the boards</i> (v. 28) passed through from end to end.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">93</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, the middle bar was not inserted into the boards. It was placed on the outside of the boards, as explained in note 91.</i> <i>To work it in the midst</i> (be-tokh) <i>of the blue, and in the midst of the purple</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">94</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Translated literally.</i> (Ex. 39:3) is similar,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">95</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to I.E. the word <i>be-tokh</i> (in the midst) does not always literally mean in the midst of an object’s very body. It can be taken to mean midpoint or between. Thus in Ex. 39:3, <i>be-tokh</i> (in the midst) means among. Similarly, in verse 28 <i>be-tokh ha-kerahsim</i> does not mean in the very midst of the board’s body but rather at the midpoint of the board’s outer surface.</i> as is <i>and put the bells in the midst</i> (be-tokh) <i>of the pomegranates</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The meaning of which is, put the bells between the pomegranates.</i> (Ex. 39:25).

Now, they first set up the western wall. For two boards were set aside to serve as corners<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">99</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On the northwest and southwest corners of the tabernacle. For the corner boards see verse 23.</i> of the tabernacle,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">100</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These two corner boards were set up first.</i> as the meaning of <i>mekutzot</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">101</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In verse 23.</i> is corners. The same was true of half of the corners of the courtyard,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">102</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The tabernacle courtyard had four corner poles. Two of them were set up first.</i> for the courtyard<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">103</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Like the tabernacle.</i> was in the form of a parallelogram. We thus have two corners. Now these two corner boards were not the same size as the other boards mentioned in Scripture.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">104</sup><i class=\"footnote\">All the boards of the tabernacle were 1 1/2 cubits in width. These two boards were a little more than half a cubit. See note 108.</i> Scripture therefore separates these boards<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">105</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Scripture discusses these boards apart from the other boards.</i> and says, <i>thus shall it be for them both</i> (v. 24), that is, only for them and not for any of the other boards. The tabernacle was erected by utilizing these two boards. The remaining six boards<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">106</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Western boards.</i> were placed in the middle.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">107</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Between the two corner boards.</i> The width of the tabernacle was thus ten cubits.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">108</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The six boards came to 9 cubits. Each one of the corner boards came to a little more than half a cubit. A half cubit of open space and a little more to cover the width of the boards made up the northern and southern walls of the tabernacle.</i> We do not know if the corner boards were square or round,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">109</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since these boards were not the same size as the other boards, it is possible that they were likewise not shaped like them. In fact, being corner boards they might have been round.</i> for we have only one remaining cubit.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">110</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To cover. See note 108.</i> According to Rabbi Solomon’s explanation, these boards did not stand in a straight line<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">111</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is hard to ascertain what I.E. means by this. According to Rashi the corner boards did stand in a straight line with the other six boards. Filwarg writes, “I cannot explain this.” Sarim similarly comments, “I did not find any scholar or commentary that explains I.E.’s language.” Meijler suggests that what I.E. means by “these boards did not stand in a straight line” is that the corner boards did not serve the same purpose as the other six boards. For the other six boards served to cover the inside of the tabernacle while most of the surface of the corner boards served to cover the northern and southern boards.</i> because half a cubit was inside the tabernacle.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">112</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, because only half a cubit was inside of the tabernacle. According to Rashi, who accepts the Talmudic tradition that the boards were a cubit in thickness, the two outer boards like all the other boards were 1 1/2 cubits in width. One half a cubit of each one of the corner boards filled the remaining open spaces left over after the six boards were placed on the western side of the tabernacle (see note 108). See Rashi on verse 23.</i> We are dealing with boards, not with garments.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">113</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, there is no way that a board measuring 1 1/2 cubits can be squeezed into a space measuring half a cubit.</i> They then<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">114</sup><i class=\"footnote\">After setting up the western wall of the tabernacle.</i> set up the boards on the northern and southern sides. Now an amount equivalent to the thickness of the boards<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">115</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Of the western wall (Filwarg).</i> protruded<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">116</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On the eastern side of the tabernacle.</i> from the tabernacle.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">117</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, from underneath the fabric curtain which is referred to as the tabernacle. See I.E. on verse 15 and the notes thereto. I.E.’s point is that when the fabric curtains, which measured 44 by 28 cubits, were sewn together and placed over the tabernacle, which measured 30 by 10 cubits, 10 of the 44 cubits covered the back of the tabernacle, an undetermined amount covered the thickness of the boards of the western wall, and what remained covered the top of the tabernacle.

If it is not a scribal error, then I.E. quoted from memory and erred.</i> <i>that did wear a linen</i> (bad) <i>ephod</i> (I Sam. 22:18).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We thus see that there were 80 ephods.</i> Many commentaries explain this verse as meaning that the <i>persons</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Spoken of in I Sam. 22:18.</i> were fit to wear the ephod.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod</i> means fourscore and five persons who were fit to wear a linen ephod. In other words, they did not actually wear an ephod but were worthy of wearing the ephod made by Moses.</i> However, they did not bother to learn the truth.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Their interpretation does not solve the problem of there being more than one ephod.</i> A <i>bad</i> (linen) ephod is an ephod made from a type of flax. However, the ephod made by Moses was not made of <i>bad</i> (linen).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hence I Sam. 22:18 cannot be interpreted as meaning that the priests were worthy of wearing the ephod made by Moses.</i> It was made of gold, blue wool, purple wool, and scarlet, with <i>shesh</i> (linen)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shesh</i> is a high quality linen.</i> intertwined with all of the aforementioned.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, even though our verse states that the ephod made by Moses contained linen it was not made wholly out of linen. It was made out of all the material enumerated in our verse (Weiser).</i> They only inquired of the breastplate of judgment which had the Urim and Thummim upon it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This introduces another problem connected with the ephod. Namely, it is clear from most places in Scripture that questions concerning future actions were directed to the Urim and Thummim, which were placed in the breastplate of judgment, which was placed on the ephod. However, David inquired of Abiathar’s ephod in Ziklag. Now as I.E. later shows, Abiathar’s ephod is not to be identified with Moses’ ephod. Thus in addition to the problem of a multiplicity of ephods, the question arises as to how these other ephods worked, as these ephods did not have the Urim and Thummim attached to them.</i> Scripture similarly writes, <i>by the judgment of the Urim before the Lord</i> (Num. 27:21). <i>Bring hither the ephod</i> (I Sam. 23:9)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">64</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Spoken by David who asked: will <i>the men of Keilah deliver me up into his</i> [Saul’s] <i>hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard?</i> (I Sam. 23:11).</i> does not present a counterargument<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Prima facie</i>, this verse implies that the ephod itself served as the instrument by which God’s will was divined.</i> because the breastplate was connected to it. The Urim<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And Thummim. See next note.</i> went along with the breastplate.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">67</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus it was the Urim and Thummim which served to reveal God’s will.</i> We similarly read, <i>till there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim</i> (Neh. 7:65). Scripture likewise states, <i>Thy Thummim and Thy Urim</i> (Deut. 33:8). Now, Scripture tells us<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Sam. 30:7,8.</i> that God answered David through Abiathar’s ephod.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Ziklag. This ephod did not have the Urim and Thummim with it. The problem described above in note 61 now follows.</i> However, we also read that when Saul went to war he inquired of the Urim (I Sam. 28:6). These were the very Urim that were placed in the breastplate of judgment which was with the ephod<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It was attached to the ephod.</i> and the ark.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It was worn by the priest who accompanied the ark.</i> However, David inquired of Abiathar’s ephod in Ziklag. Abiathar’s ephod was thus not Moses’ ephod.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">72</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Moses’ ephod was with Saul. We thus see that other ephods served to divine God’s will.</i> The following problem is even more difficult.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">73</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Than the above-raised question relating to a multiplicity of ephods and how they worked.</i> It is clear that the Urim do not refer to the stones of the breastplate,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">74</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Urim [means] they made their words enlightening [and Thummim] because they fulfill their words” (Soncino, <i>Yoma</i> 73b). Rashi explains that the stones on the breastplate of judgment served as the instrument of divination by lighting up. See Rashi on verse 30. Also see note 88. However, Rashi does not identify the stones on the breastplate with the Urim and Thummim. Other commentaries taking the Talmud at face value did. It is with these commentaries that I.E. takes issue.</i> as Scripture openly states, <i>And thou shalt set in it settings of stones</i> (v. 17). The setting of the stones was the work of a stonecutter and not the work of Moses. God then told Moses,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">75</sup><i class=\"footnote\">After describing how the stones were to be arranged on the breastplate.</i> <i>And thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim</i> (v. 30).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">76</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is thus clear that the Urim and Thummim are not to be identified with the stones on the breastplate of judgment.</i> Scripture, in describing the making of the breastplate,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">77</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The printed texts have ephod. This is an obvious error. The word ephod does not appear in <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38. The latter reads: “Scripture in describing its making,” the reference being to the making of the previously mentioned breastplate.</i> tells us, <i>And they set in it four rows of stones</i> (Ex. 39:10). Scripture then describes the four rows of stones.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">78</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We thus see that the stones are part of the breastplate and are not to be identified with the Urim and Thummim.</i> Scripture tells us that Moses placed the breastplate upon Aaron <i>and in the breastplate he put the Urim and the Thummim</i> (Lev. 8:8). Now according to the plain meaning of the text the stones were not the objects that enlightened or fulfilled,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">79</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, the stones on the breastplate are not to be identified with the Urim and Thummim. See note 73.</i> because inquiries were made of the Urim and Thummim. We do not know what they were. The explanation that the names of the tribes<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">80</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As noted above, the Talmud explains that the letters on the stones lit up. It then says, “But the <i>tzadi</i> was not inscribed on any of the stones.” For none of the tribes has a <i>tzadi</i> in their names. The Talmud responds, “Rabbi Samuel ben Isaac says, ‘The names of Abraham, Isaac (Hebrew, <i>yod, <span class=\"underline\">tzadi.</span> chet, kof</i>), and Jacob were also inscribed upon the stones’” (<i>Yoma</i> 73b).</i> and the patriarchs<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">81</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See note 80. The Talmud says, “But the <i>tet</i> was not inscribed on the stones.” The words <i>shivte yeshurun</i> (the tribes of Jeshurun) were similarly inscribed on the stones” (<i>Yoma</i> 72b).</i> were inscribed on the breastplate is of no help,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">82</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It does not help us to understand what the Urim and Thummim were.</i> for the breastplate of judgment was so called only because of the Urim that were on it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">83</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And as we have seen, the Urim cannot be identical with the stones which were upon the breastplate.</i> There is an additional question: we cannot identify the Urim with the Thummim,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">84</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, we do not know what the Thummim were.</i> for Scripture states, <i>with Urim and Thummim</i> (Neh. 7:65). Furthermore, the words <i>with Urim</i> and <i>Thummim</i> are in the plural. They thus consisted of many objects.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">85</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And we do not know what these objects were.</i> Rabbi Solomon says that the Urim and Thummim consisted of an inscription of God’s explicit name.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">86</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Rashi on verse 30: “The Urim and Thummim consisted of an inscription of God’s explicit name [upon some unknown material] which was placed inside the folds of the breastplate by means of which it [the breastplate] shed light upon its words and fulfilled its words.” That is, made its statements clear and its promises true.</i> However, he would not have said this had he seen the responsa of Rabbi Hai Gaon.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">87</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to Rabbi Hai Gaon, inscriptions of God’s explicit name cannot be used to divine the future. Nor do they assure success in any endeavor (Rabbi Samuel Zarza, <i>Mekor Chayyim</i>).</i> There is a very deep secret behind the ephod and the breastplate. I will allude only to a part of this secret. Perhaps he who knows the mind of the Most High will understand it. The following are the keys to the secret of the ephod.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">88</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to I.E. the ephod was an astrological instrument which corresponded to the arrangement of the heavens. It drew power from above and, when properly used, had the ability to predict the future. Nahmanides sided with Rashi’s interpretation of the ephod and took strong issue with I.E. See Nahmanides on verse 30, “Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra thought to display wisdom in the matter of the Urim and the Thummim, by saying that they were made by a craftsman from gold and silver, and he continued his discussion of them in this vein, for he thought that they were akin to the forms which the astrologers make in order to know the thoughts of the one who comes to ask of them [about the future]. But what [Ibn Ezra] said is of no import. Rather, the Urim and Thummim are as Rashi has written: this was an inscription of the Proper Name of G-d which was placed between the folds of the breast-plate” (Chavel translation).</i> The two wreathen chains on the two rings [represent the head of Aries and Libra].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">89</sup><i class=\"footnote\">So Zarza. I.E. does not explain what the two wreathen chains on the two rings stand for. Sarim suggests that a line is missing. However, it is possible that I.E. believed that, from what follows, it is obvious what the two wreathen chains on the two rings stand for.</i> The band of the ephod represents the celestial equator.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">90</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The celestial equator extends from Aries to Libra. It divides the 12 constellations into two parts.</i> Hence six names were inscribed on the stone which was on the other shoulder.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">91</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They represent the six constellations that lie on the other side of the equator. The point is that six names were written on the two stones of the ephod. Each group of names represented six constellations.</i> Now these things<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">92</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The division of the heavens into 12 distinct sections can only be grasped by the mind, for when one looks at the sky one does not see 12 distinct areas in the sky.</i> can only be grasped by the mind. Hence six names were inscribed on one stone<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">93</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On one of the stones of the ephod.</i> in accordance with the number, names, and order of birth of the tribes of the children of Israel.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">94</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Each stone contained six names. There were no boundaries between them. The stone, as it were, took in all the names in the same way that the sky encompasses all the stars.</i> Six names were similarly inscribed on the second stone.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">95</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Of the ephod.</i> On the other hand, the names on the breastplate were not divided in the same manner as they are grasped by the mind.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, six names were not written on one stone and six on another, with their boundaries left to the imagination. See notes 92 and 93.</i> They were divided in a way that could be perceived by the eye.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">97</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Each tribe’s name was inscribed on a separate stone.</i> Scripture states, <i>And they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the rings of the ephod with a thread of blue</i> (v. 28) to prevent the breastplate from moving to the side.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">98</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To correspond to the stars that do not move out of their fixed orbits (Weiser).</i> The breastplate was folded, for the Urim and Thummim were kept there until such time as they were needed. They were then placed outside of the breastplate.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">99</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They were removed from the folds of the breastplate.</i> Note, the stones of the ephod were like each other.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">100</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They were of the same size.</i> They were of one color.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">101</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They were both sapphires.</i> This was not the case with the stones of the breastplate,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">102</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Each stone corresponded to a different constellation.</i> for the sapphire stones<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">103</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Which were placed upon the ephod.</i> served as a memorial,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">104</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See verse 12.</i> while the judgment of the children of Israel was upon the stones of the breastplate.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">105</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Judgment descended upon the children of Israel via each stone which represented a constellation.</i> The word Urim is related to the word <i>ur</i> (fire) in <i>I am warm, I have seen the fire</i> (Is. 44:16).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">106</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to I.E. <i>ur</i> is a variation of <i>or</i> and should thus be translated as light. Hence, according to I.E., Is. 44:16 should be rendered: <i>I am warm, I have seen the light</i> (Krinsky). It should be noted that Nahmanides’ text of I.E. reads: “The Urim and Thummim were made out of gold.”</i> The Thummim are so called because they are whole.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">107</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The root of <i>tummim</i> (thummim) is <i>taf, mem, mem</i>.</i> The Urim were of gold and silver. This was not the case with the Thummim.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">108</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.E. does not identify the material that the Thummim were made of.</i> The [importance of the] number [twelve] has been established by irrefutable proof from the upper and lower worlds.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">109</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It has been established by irrefutable proof that the 12 constellations of the upper world determine the fate of all human beings who dwell in the lower world. Or the importance of the number twelve has been established by the fact that there are 12 constellations in the upper world and 12 tribes of Israel in the lower world (Weiser).</i> The intelligent will understand what I say.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">110</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reference is either to the number 12 or to how the ephod functioned.</i> Now the priests had many ephodim. They all had bands. However, they lacked the breastplate and the Urim. A priest who was an expert in using the Urim and Thummim was able to respond to an inquirer because the ephod at hand resembled [the ephod made by Moses].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">111</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It was a duplicate of the ephod made by Moses. Hence astrologically speaking it “worked.”</i> However, the priest did not always get an answer.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">112</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The priest received an answer only at a propitious time.</i> Now if I wanted to even begin to reveal this secret<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">113</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Of how the ephod worked.</i> it would take up more space than the entire commentary which I have composed on this book. For only an individual who has studied works on geometry and the secret of the way the sky works can understand the secret of the ephod.

Rabbi Solomon<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">150</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi.</i> found it necessary to harmonize Scripture<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">151</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to Rashi, verse 37 appears to contradict itself and Ex. 39:31. For verse 37 states, <i>And thou shalt put it</i> (the plate) <i>on a thread of blue</i>. However, it goes on to say, <i>and it</i> (the plate) <i>shall be upon the mitre</i>. This implies that the plate was on the mitre, not upon the thread. Furthermore, Ex. 39:31 states, <i>And they tied unto it</i> [the plate] a <i>thread of blue</i>. In other words, verse 37 implies that the plate was placed upon the thread, but Ex. 39:31 implies that the thread was placed on top of the plate.</i> by explaining that three blue threads were attached to the plate.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">152</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi explains that the plate was perforated at three points, viz., at the top and at the two ends of the plate. A thread was inserted through each of these perforations. Each thread was thus doubled when pulled through. Hence Rashi speaks of six threads. The threads were then tied together at the back of the neck. The thread in the center passed over the head and was bound with the ends of the two other threads. Rashi explains: “All the verses are now harmonized, <i>a thread upon the plate, and the plate upon the thread, and a thread upon the mitre on</i> top.” The first refers to the threads on the outer side of the plate, the second to the threads on the inner side of the plate, and the third to the threads that passed through the middle perforation.</i> However, according to the plain meaning of the text only one blue thread<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">153</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Attached to both extremities of the plate.</i> was necessary to keep the plate, which was on the face of the mitre on the forehead, in place."

There are many similar instances in Scripture. Now you will never find [the mitre and the head-tires interchanging].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">163</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, contra Rashi on this verse, the mitre and the head-tire are not identical, for if they were, Scripture would interchange these terms.

In other words, the mitre is not to be identified with the head-tire.</i> For the mitre was set aside only for Aaron, and the head-tires for his children. Some say that the word <i>migba’ot</i> (head-tires) is related to the word <i>givot</i> (hills) (Gen. 49:26).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">164</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, the <i>migba’at</i> had the shape of a high hat.</i> The mitre<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">165</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hebrew, <i>mitznefet</i>.</i> surrounded and wrapped the head.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">166</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hence it is not to be identified with the <i>migba’at</i>.</i> We similarly read, <i>He will violently roll</i> (tzanof) <i>and toss thee Like a ball</i> (yitznofkha tzenefah) (Is. 22:18); <i>Yea, He will wind thee round and round</i> (ve-otekha ato) (Is. 22:17). The one who knows how the mitre is wrapped knows the meaning of [<i>The mitre shall be removed…</i>] <i>this shall be no more the same: that which is low shall be exalted, and that which is high abased</i> (Ezek. 21:31).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">167</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to I.E. the meaning of the verse is: The mitre shall be removed…this shall no more be the same; the material making up the mitre shall no longer be wound from the bottom up or from the top down; i.e., the <i>miztnefet</i> shall no longer be wound about the head.</i> It takes a special skill to wind a mitre around the head. Now Scripture states, <i>And thou shalt set the mitre upon his head, and put the holy crown upon the mitre</i> (Ex. 29:6). The <i>tzitz</i> (plate) (v. 36) is thus called a <i>nezer</i> (crown).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">168</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Not to be confused with the word <i>keter</i> (crown), as the <i>keter</i> covers the entire head.</i> <i>But upon himself shall his crown</i> (nizro) <i>shine</i> (yatzitz) is similar (Ps. 132:18).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">169</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In that the root of the word <i>tzitz</i> is used in connection with <i>nezer</i>.</i> Perhaps they all<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">170</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word <i>tzitz</i> in our chapter and the word <i>yatzitz</i> in Ps. 132:18.</i> are used in the sense of <i>tzitz</i>, meaning something seen.

Note that the five senses come together in the two cavities which are in that part of the brain which is behind the forehead. This is where the imaginative power is located. Furthermore, all thoughts begin there. It is for this reason that Scripture writes, regarding the plate, that Aaron shall bear the iniquity <i>committed in the holy things</i> (v. 38).

Meijler is of the opinion that I.E. believes that in contrast to the laying of the hands upon the rams, Aaron first laid his hands upon the bullock and then his sons did the same. The difference of opinion revolves around how we interpret “Scripture thus describes exactly what happened.” Krinsky takes it to refer to both instances, while Meijler takes it to refer only to the second instance.

However, Israel made a calf, not a he-goat. We thus see that Israel’s sin offering was not to atone for the sin of the golden calf. The same must be true of the offering brought by the high priest.</i> The red heifer<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">118</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Num. 19.</i> similarly was not brought to atone for idolatry.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">119</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, to atone for the sin of the golden calf.

Only Moses and Aaron served as such. See I.E. 27:19. I.E. comments thus because Jewish tradition considers Solomon and David as prophets. Yet David and Solomon sinned. Hence I.E. differentiates between a mere prophet and a prophet who is sent to reveal commandments.</i> Now Scripture tells us that shortly before Moses died, he said, <i>Thy Thummim and Thy Urim be with Thy holy one</i> (Deut. 33:8).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">122</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse continues, <i>Whom Thou didst prove at Massah, With whom Thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah</i>. I.E. believes that the verse refers to Aaron. He interprets the first part of the verse as meaning, Aaron is fit to wear the Thummim and Urim because of his piety. He interprets the second part of the verse as meaning that the only stain on Aaron’s piety was the incident at the waters of Meribah. See I.E. on Deut. 33:8.</i> However, he did not mention the incident of the calf.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">123</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Deut. 33:8.</i> The only sin found in Aaron was the sin found in Moses, which was the incident of the waters of Meribah,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">124</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For the incident at the waters of Meribah, see Num. 20:1-12.</i> which I will explain in its place.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">125</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 33:8.</i> Some say that Israel fooled Aaron. Israel made a mold of a calf. Aaron was unaware of this and cast the gold into the fire. They offer as proof, <i>I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf</i> (Deut. 32:24). However, this is incorrect, for if Aaron was a fool whom simpletons could deceive, why would God have chosen him? Furthermore, why did Aaron build an altar before the calf and command that Israel slaughter sacrifices and burnt offerings upon it?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">126</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If Aaron was tricked, he would have been shocked upon seeing the calf. He would not have commanded that an altar be built before the calf and burnt offerings be offered upon it.</i> Others say that the individual named Aaron who made the calf was not Aaron the brother of Moses. This too is nonsense, for the congregation that gathered,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">127</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, the congregation that gathered against Aaron and demanded that he make a god for them.</i> only gathered against the one who stood in place of Moses. Scripture clearly states, behold, <i>Aaron and Hur are with you</i> (Ex. 24:14).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">128</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Moses appointed Aaron in his place till he returned.</i> If the one who made the calf was someone else named Aaron, why didn’t Aaron kill him? Why didn’t Moses kill him when he came down from the mountain? Moses even prayed on his behalf.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">129</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Not only did Moses not kill the individual called Aaron, he prayed on his behalf.</i> It is not fitting for a pious man to make an idol for others so that they do not die.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">130</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The opinion that Aaron made the calf because he was afraid that Israel would kill him if he refused and that God in return would destroy Israel is also wrong. For it is not fitting that a pious man make an idol for others so that they do not die. Ibn Ezra here rejects the earlier quoted opinion that Aaron made the calf because he was afraid that God would destroy Israel if they killed Aaron. It should be noted that I.E. occasionally leaves out the first part of a clause. He expects the reader to fill it in.</i> There are also many who say that the meaning of <i>Tomorrow shall be a feast to the Lord</i> (Ex. 32:5) is that those who served the calf would be killed by Moses.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">131</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This interpretation maintains that <i>a feast</i> (chag) <i>to the Lord</i> refers to the slaughter of the worshippers of the golden calf.</i> But the meaning of <i>Tomorrow shall be a feast</i> (chag) <i>to the Lord</i> can only mean that after Aaron built the altar before the calf, he commanded that an announcement be made in the camp that they should slaughter sacrifices the next day on the altar which he built. The meaning of <i>chag</i> (feast) is a sacrifice, as in <i>bind the offering with thick ropes</i> (Ps. 118:27).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">132</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Translated according to I.E.</i> This is what Israel did, for we read, <i>and they arose early on the morrow, and offered burnt-offerings</i> (Ex. 31:6). Thoughts are of no avail,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">133</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One should not maintain that while most people understood <i>Tomorrow shall be a feast</i> (chag) <i>to the Lord</i> to mean they would offer sacrifices on the next day, Aaron’s private meaning was: Tomorrow worshippers of the golden calf will be slaughtered.</i> for one who curses God is killed for what he said.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">134</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He cannot claim that his intention was not to curse God.</i> The case is the same with a person who says, <i>Let us go and serve other gods</i> (Deut. 13:7).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">135</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He is killed for what he said. He cannot claim that he didn’t mean what he said.</i> The one who explains <i>I am Esau thy first-born</i> (Gen. 27:19) as meaning, I am what I am, but Esau is your first-born, is not offering the plain meaning of the text. Neither is he explaining the text in accordance with the rules of rhetoric.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">136</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See I.E. on Gen. 27:13 (Vol. 1, p. 262) and the notes thereto.</i> If a person asks his neighbor in a law court, “Are you the one to whom I lent the following sum of money?” and his neighbor responds, “I am,” he cannot later say, “What I meant was, I am his neighbor.” The same also applies to what Daniel said to Nebuchadnezzar: <i>My lord, the dream</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">137</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nebuchadnezzar had a dream which signified that he would live as a beast for seven years.</i> <i>be to them that hate thee</i> (Dan. 4:16).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">138</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to the Talmud what Daniel meant was: God (<i>My lord</i>), the dream be upon Nebuchadnezzar (<i>the dream be to them that hate thee</i>). See <i>Shavuot</i> 35b.</i> Daniel spoke according to the rules of etiquette.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">139</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to I.E. the term <i>my lord</i> does not refer to God but to Nebuchadnezzar, for Daniel was addressing the king, and the rules of etiquette required that he say, <i>My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee</i>. Hence one cannot take his words out of context and interpret it the way the Talmud does.</i> I will now cite for you the opinion of the Gaon. Rabbi Saadiah said that Aaron, like Jehu, acted with guile.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">140</sup><i class=\"footnote\">King Jehu proclaimed a festival for Baal. His intention was not to serve Baal but to trick the worshippers of Baal to come to Baal’s temple, where Jehu would kill them. See II Kings 10:18-28. Aaron similarly wanted to identify those Israelites who wanted to worship the calf.</i> Hence Aaron built the altar.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">141</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hence Aaron built the altar before the golden calf.</i> Saadiah Gaon raised the following question against his own interpretation: “If Aaron acted with guile, then why was God angry with him?” The Gaon answered that God was angry with Aaron because he did not immediately kill those who worshipped the calf, as Moses did when he arrived. However, this too is incorrect, for Aaron called out, <i>Tomorrow shall be a feast to the Lord</i> (YHVH) (32:5). Aaron employed the name <i>YHVH</i>. This name is a proper noun in honor of the Lord. It is not used for any other being.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">142</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If Aaron intended to trap the idol worshippers he would not have said, <i>Tomorrow shall be a feast to the Lord</i> (YHVH), for this is a call to worship <i>YHVH</i> and only <i>YHVH</i>.</i> It is not like the name <i>Elohim</i> (God), which is used in many different ways. Furthermore, why didn’t Aaron mention this when he responded to Moses?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">143</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Moses asked Aaron: <i>What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought a great sin upon them?</i> (Ex. 32:21).</i> For Aaron said, <i>I cast it into the fire</i> (Ex. 32:24). Aaron’s answer is not in keeping with the question.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">144</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Aaron’s answer does not answer Moses’ question.</i> I will now begin to briefly explain part of the secret.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">145</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, the true meaning of the account of the making of the golden calf.</i> Far be it, far be it for Aaron to make an idol. Israel also did not ask for an idol. What happened was that Israel thought that Moses, who, as I have explained, had led them on their journey from the Red Sea, had died,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">146</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.E. believes that Moses, rather than the pillar of fire, led Israel from the Red Sea to the wilderness of Sinai. See I.E. on Ex. 15:22.</i> for Israel noticed that the manna did not come down at Mount Sinai. Furthermore, Moses tarried on the mountain for forty days. A human being does not have the stamina to live that long without food. Also, Moses did not tell them when he would descend.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">147</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If Moses had told them that he would be on the mount for forty days, they would not have assumed that he died there.</i> Moses himself did not know this, for God told him, “Come up to Me onto the mount and be there until I give you the tablets of stone.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">148</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.E.’s paraphrase of Ex. 24:12.</i> The word <i>elohim</i> (god) refers to a glorious being dwelling in an image of a body.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">149</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, Israel did not ask Aaron to make an idol. They requested that he make an image which had the power to lead them. Thus <i>aseh lanu elohim</i> (Ex. 32:1) does not mean: make us a god. It means: make us an image which will be inhabited by a heavenly power.</i> Israel said as follows: <i>who shall go before us</i> (Ex. 32:l).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">150</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Israel said: <i>Up, make us a god</i> (elohim) <i>who shall go before us</i> (Ex. 32:1). We thus see that they sought an <i>elohim</i> who would lead them.</i> If you pay attention to Israel’s first journey<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">151</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Israel’s first journey from Egypt.</i> you will understand this.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">152</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Scripture tells us that when Israel left Egypt, <i>the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire</i> (Ex. 13:21). After Egypt drowned in the Red Sea, Moses led Israel. See note 158. Now that Moses was dead, Israel sought a substitute for Moses. See I.E.’s short commentary: “They only sought someone to go before them to find them a resting place.”</i> The calf was thus made for the glory of God.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">153</sup><i class=\"footnote\">God’s spirit was to rest on the calf and lead them in the same way that it rested in the pillars of fire and cloud. See I.E. on Ex. 13:21.</i> Hence Aaron built an altar before the calf and announced that they should offer sacrifices on the morrow for the glory of God.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">154</sup><i class=\"footnote\">His spirit would rest on the calf.</i> Israel did as Aaron commanded them. Aaron’s answer was<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">155</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Aaron did not actually say this. I.E.’s point is that Ex. 32:1 can be quoted in Aaron’s defense.</i> that the people gathered themselves upon him (Ex. 32:l).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">156</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The point is that Aaron did not make the calf on his own. The people gathered upon him and demanded that he make an <i>elohim</i> to lead them.</i> I have already noted that whenever the verb <i>kahal</i> (gathered) is followed by the word <i>al</i> (upon) it has a negative connotation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">157</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ex. 32:1.</i> However, if it is followed by the word <i>el</i> (to), as in <i>And all the men of Israel assembled themselves</i> (va-yikkhal) <i>unto</i> (el) <i>king Solomon</i> (I Kings 8:2), then it has a positive connotation. This is the meaning of <i>thou knowest the people, that they are set on evil</i> (Ex. 32:22). The meaning of the verse is: I did not do evil to them. For they merely asked for a being that would go before them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">158</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.E.’s interpretation of <i>Make us a god, which shall go before us</i> (Ex. 32:23).</i> I made the calf for the glory of God.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">159</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.E.’s interpretation of <i>and I cast it into the fire and there came out this calf</i> (Ex. 24:24).</i> However, [the calf became an object of worship] because there was a mixed multitude among Israel. This what Aaron meant by <i>ve-ra hu</i> (they are set on evil).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">160</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to I.E. <i>ve-ra hu</i> means there is evil in him; that is, some of the people are evil (Weiser).</i> Aaron did not say <i>ra hu</i> (they are evil). A small group of Israelites thought that the calf was an idol. They brought sacrifices and bowed to the calf and said, <i>This is thy god, O Israel</i> (Ex. 32:4).

See <i>San.</i> 22a.</i> Some believe that the word <i>ashurit</i> means a praise-worthy script.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">80</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hebrew, <i>she-me’usheret be-khetav</i>. See <i>San.</i> 22a. According to this opinion the square script was the one in which the tablets were written. The Talmud, which maintains that the <i>mem</i> and the <i>samekh</i> were miraculously suspended on the tablets, accepts this opinion. So does I.E. in his comments on Ex. 1:9. Nevertheless, he argues that one does not have to assume that the <i>mem</i> and the <i>samekh</i> were miraculously suspended on the tablets, as he believes that the tablets were written on both sides and not chiseled through.</i> Others maintain that it refers to the script which they brought up from Assyria.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">81</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hebrew, <i>ashur</i>. Hence the term <i>ashurit</i>. According to this opinion the Torah was given in <i>ketav ivri</i>, the ancient Hebrew script. In this script neither the <i>samekh</i> nor the <i>mem</i> is oval. According to this opinion there is no need to assume that the <i>mem</i> and the <i>samekh</i> were miraculously suspended on the tablets. I.E. quotes these two opinions in order to show that the rabbis themselves were divided as to whether the <i>mem</i> and the <i>samekh</i> were miraculously suspended on the tablets.</i> Furthermore, if the letters were visible on the reverse side, then the letters would appear backwards.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">82</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They could thus be read on only one side. What point would there be then for the writing to be chiseled through?</i> There is no room for one to argue with me and ask whether these stones were precious.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">83</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to an earlier opinion quoted by I.E. the tablets were made of precious stones. I.E. disagreed with this opinion. Now one can object to I.E.’s rejection of this opinion on the ground that it is inconceivable that the divine tablets would be made of ordinary stone.</i> The answer is that the stones were very precious because the writing of God was engraved upon them. The stones had to be thick. Where would Moses find very precious stones that were a cubit in length, a cubit and a half in width,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">84</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For the dimensions of the tablets, see I.E.’s comment on Ex. 25:10. I.E. there explains that the tablets were a cubed cubit. The words “and a half” thus appear to be an error. It was the ark that was a cubit and a half in width. Hence the error.</i> and a cubit in height? Furthermore, where would Moses get the raw material to hew out two tablets of precious stones of the same dimensions as the first stones? Now we do not know the way the Ten Statements were written on the two tablets without Moses having to turn them over.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">85</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, <i>tables that were written on both their sides</i> implies that some of the Statements were written on one side of the tablet and others on the reverse side. Thus Moses had to turn them around to read them or show their complete comments to the people. Hence Scripture goes on to say, <i>on the one side and on the other side were they written;</i> i.e., what was written on one side was written on the other side.</i> Hence after telling us <i>that were written on both their sides</i>, Scripture goes on to say, <i>on the one side and on the other side were they written</i>. We have no way of knowing whether each one of the tablets was completely covered with writing, or whether some blank spaces were left on the four corners as we do today with our books. We similarly do not know whether the writing was thick or thin. There is no reason for us to speculate concerning things for which we do not have a tradition."

God answered Moses, <i>My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest</i> (v. 14). The meaning of <i>thee</i> is: because I will go only with thee, but I will not rest in the midst of the children of Israel.

When one of them sees this light, he says: “I have seen the glory of the Lord…” However, when they beheld this light, they were unable to look upon it because of its power and brilliance. Indeed, whoever looked upon it incurred the disintegration of his entire makeup and the flight of his spirit from his body.<br>Moses accordingly asked his Master to give him the strength to look upon this light. The latter, however, answered him that the first rays of this light were so powerful that he would be unable to view them clearly with his naked eyes, lest he perish. He would rather cover him up with a cloud or the like until the first rays of this light had passed, because the greatest strength of every radiant body is contained in its initial approach. All of this was implied in the statement of Scripture: <i>And I…will cover thee with My hand until I have passed by</i>. Then when, the first portion of the light had passed, God removed from Moses the thing that had covered him, so that he might be able to look at the back of the light, as Scripture says: <i>And I will take away My hand, and thou shalt see My back”</i> (Saadiah Gaon, <i>The Book Of Beliefs And Opinion</i>.

Hence they cannot benefit or harm. Thus they cannot help one who bows down to them, for what was decreed for him in accordance with the arrangements of the stars at the time of his birth shall befall him. He can only be saved from his fate if he cleaves to and is protected by a power that is higher and more powerful than the stars. I will explain with a worthy parable. The arrangement of the stars had it that a river would overpower a city and kill or flood its inhabitants. A prophet came and warned the people to turn to God before the arrival of the day of their calamity. The people turned to God with all their heart. Because the people cleaved unto God, God put it into their hearts to go out of the city to pray unto the Lord. They did this. On the appointed day the river suddenly overflowed, as is its nature. We have witnessed this many times. The river flooded the entire city. Now God’s decree was not altered and He saved them. Imagine the following: The seven moving stars are like horses that run along a path. They do not run with the intention of doing good or bad. They act in accordance with their nature. Now imagine that a blind man is in their path. The blind man does not know how the horses act. He does not know when they go to the right and when they go to the left. The blind man depends on a person with sight who knows the way the horses run. Now the person with sight will guard the blind man. When the horses run to one side he will lead the blind person to the other side. The course of the horse’s running does not change but the blind man is saved. It is because of this that Scripture states, [<i>the sun, and the moon and the stars, even all the host of heaven…</i>] <i>which the Lord thy God hath allotted</i> [<i>unto all the peoples under the whole heaven</i>] (Deut. 4:19); <i>But you hath the Lord taken…to be unto Him a people of inheritance</i> (Deut. 4:20). <i>The portion of Jacob is not like these, For He is the former of all things</i> (Jer. 51:19).

See I.E. on Num. 9:1. In other words, Moses set up the tabernacle and took it down during each one of the first seven days of consecration. On the eighth day, “God commanded that Moses erect the tabernacle on the first day of the first month and that he not take it apart until the ark journeyed.” See note 8.</i> in order to train the priests.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the service.</i> They say<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In keeping with their opinion that the eighth day of consecration described in Lev. 9 took place on the first day of Nisan.</i> that the goat that Moses inquired about <i>and, behold, it was burnt</i> (Lev. 10:16) was a new moon offering.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Concerning the offerings brought on the new moon see Num. 28:11-15.</i> Now God commanded that Moses erect the tabernacle on the first day of the first month and that he not take it apart until the ark journeyed.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Num. 10:11,35. According to this opinion when our verse relates that God told Moses, <i>On the first day of the first month shalt thou rear up the tabernacle</i>, it means: on the first day of the first month shalt thou rear up the tabernacle and not take it apart until the ark journeys. Those who interpret our verse thus do so because they believe that Moses first erected the tabernacle on the 23 day of Nisan.</i> Now we find it stated in the <i>Sifre</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sifre</i> on Num. 9:6.</i> that Mishael and Elzaphan<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishael and Elzaphan were the nephews of Aaron. They carried the bodies of Nadab and Abihu from the tabernacle after their demise in the sanctuary on the eighth day of consecration. See Lev 10:1-5.</i> were the ones <i>who were unclean by the dead body of a man</i> (Num. 9:6).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They consequently could not offer the Passover sacrifice on the 14th of Nisan.</i> The eighth was thus the eighth day of the month.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A person who touches a dead body is unclean for seven days (Num. 19:11). If Mishael and Elzaphan were unclean on the 14th of Nisan because they removed the dead bodies of their cousins from the tabernacle on the eighth day, then that day had to fall on the 8th day of Nisan rather than on the first. Now if the eight day fell on the 8th of Nisan, then the first day of consecration fell on the first day of Nisan. The tabernacle was thus erected for the first time on the first day of Nisan.</i> There is, as it were, proof of this.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That the tabernacle was first set up on the first day of Nisan.</i> First of all, why didn’t Scripture mention that Moses set up the tabernacle and took it apart?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As maintained by those who say that the temple was built for the first time on the 23rd of Adar. See note 8.</i> After the tabernacle was taken down there was no door of the tent of meeting. However, Scripture states, <i>And at the door of the tent of meeting shall ye abide day and night</i> (Lev. 8:35). Furthermore, Scripture writes, <i>And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying: Take ye a he-goat for a sin-offering</i> (Lev. 9:3). It was this he-goat that Moses inquired about.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rather than the he-goat offered on the new moon, as stated by those who maintain that the eight day fell on the first day of Nisan.</i> Additionally, if this<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The goat which Moses inquired about.</i> was a goat that served as a new moon offering, why didn’t Scripture mention two bullocks, one ram, and seven he-lambs?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If the eighth day took place on a new moon then why does Lev. 9 only mention the new moon he-goat and not the other new moon offerings? For two bullocks, one ram, seven he-lambs, and a he-goat were offered on the new moon. See Num. 28:11-15.</i> Scripture should have read, beside the burnt offering of the new moon, as it does when it states,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">With regard to the Passover offerings.</i> <i>beside the burnt-offering of the morning</i> (Num. 28:23).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If the consecration offerings brought on the eighth day were offered on the new moon, Scripture should have indicated that these offerings were brought in addition to the burnt offering of the new moon.</i> Look. According to the plain meaning of the text, the tabernacle was first erected on the first day of the first month. Observe, they raised up this first tabernacle on the first day of the first month. They began to build the first temple, which was the second tabernacle, on the second day of the second month, called Iyyar, as Scripture clearly states, <i>in the second day of the second month</i> (II Chron. 3:2).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Chron. 3:2 reads: <i>And he began to build</i> [the House of God] <i>in the second day of the second month</i>.</i> Our Talmud writes that Israel left Egypt on the fifth day of the week.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sabbath</i> 87b; <i>Seder Olam</i> 5:3. See I.E. on Ex. 16:1.</i> If they transmitted this as a tradition then we will accept it. However, if we analyze the text logically then we must conclude that they left Egypt before the fifth day of the week because there is at least three days’ difference between a simple year<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, a defective year. A defective year is one that consists of 353 days. A Hebrew year can consist of 353, 354, or 355 days. See note 36 to Gen. 8.</i> and the beginning of the next year.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, there is at least a three-day difference between the day of the week on which the year begins from one year to the other, if the first of the two years is a defective year. The difference will be more if the year has 354 or 355 days.</i> This is so because a defective year consists of three hundred and fifty-three days, three hundred and fifty of which are taken up by weeks.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There are 50 weeks in a regular year, for 50 × 7 = 350. Thus a defective year consists of 50 weeks plus 3 days.</i> In minimal leap years<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A leap year consists of 383 days.</i> there is a difference of five days.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is a difference of five days between the end of the last year and the beginning of the next. A minimal leap year consists of 383 days (353 days plus a month). 383 days comes to 54 weeks and 5 days.</i> Now it appears that Moses arranged the bread on the table<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 4 tells us that Moses was to bring the table into the tabernacle and arrange the bread on it on the day the tabernacle was erected. The tabernacle was thus erected on a Sabbath.</i> on a Sabbath,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hence it is not possible for the 15th day of Nisan in the previous year to have fallen on a Thursday. For if the 15th of Nisan fell on a Thursday, then the first day of Nisan also had to fall on a Thursday and consequently could not fall on a Saturday or a Friday the following year.</i> for Scripture states, <i>Every sabbath day he shall set if</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The showbread.</i> <i>in order</i> (Lev. 24:8).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus the showbread could be placed on the table only on a Sabbath.</i> The tabernacle was thus erected either on the sixth day<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Very close to the onset of the Sabbath (Filwarg).</i> or on the Sabbath day.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In view of the fact that the Torah states that the showbread should be on the table <i>before the Lord continually</i>, I.E. believes it unlikely for Moses to have set up the tabernacle a day or more before the Sabbath, thus leaving the table bereft of the bread.</i> This appears to be the case even though the proof just offered is not irrefutable, for one can argue that the meaning of <i>every sabbath he shall set it in order</i> is, every Sabbath the priest shall set it in order after the tabernacle has been raised and Moses has arranged the bread.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, Lev. 24:8 does not apply to the first time that Moses set up the tabernacle. Moses could have set up the tabernacle on any day of the week and placed the showbread on it. After this, the bread had to be placed on the table only on a Sabbath.</i> Observe. In describing the actual erecting of the sanctuary, Scripture tells that Moses raised up the tabernacle.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 18.</i> He erected, as I have explained, the two corner boards.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to I.E. the two corner boards mentioned in Ex. 26:23 were set up first when the tabernacle was raised. The rest of the tabernacle was then attached to these boards. See I.E. on Ex. 26:18. I.E. now adds the fact that Moses set up these two boards and that Scripture considers it as if he had erected the entire tabernacle.</i> The Levites who were of his family set up the rest of the tabernacle, for it was not the work of one person.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It was beyond the ability of Moses to raise up the entire tabernacle by himself.</i> He<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">By command.</i> laid its sockets below.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 18.</i> He then set the boards and bars in place.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid</i>.</i> He then raised up the pillars for the veil and the screen of the door of the tabernacle.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid</i>. I.E. thus notes that “the pillars” in verse 18 refers both to the pillars for the veil and to the pillars for the screen of the tabernacle door. See Ex. 26:32,37.</i> Afterwards Moses spread the tent<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Over the tabernacle. Verse 19.</i> and put the covering of the tent over it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid</i>.</i> He then placed the ark<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 21.</i> on the western side<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Of the tabernacle.</i> and placed the tablets in the ark.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 20.</i> He set the staves on the ark and placed the ark cover on top of the ark.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 20.</i> Moses put in the table and arranged the showbread upon it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 22.</i> Now Scripture indicates that this took place in the morning.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For the setting of the table preceded the morning offering.</i> Scripture states, <i>and he lighted the lamp</i> s(v. 25) afterwards at night.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For that is when the menorah was lit.

Now its meaning is,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The meaning of <i>Seven days thou shalt make atonement for the altar</i>.</i> Thus shall you do all the seven days of consecration. Scripture states, <i>And it came to pass on the day that Moses had made an end of setting up the tabernacle, and had anointed it</i> and sanctified the altar for seven days of consecration (Num. 7:1).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">72</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Num. 7:1 reads, <i>And it came to pass on the day that Moses had made an end of setting up the tabernacle, and had anointed it and sanctified it</i>.

Ebr.</i> 38, rather than <i>ki ematai</i> as in the printed texts.</i> then when did they offer the festival sacrifices?”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">87</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to I.E. the princes of Israel started to bring their dedication sacrifices on the eight day of Nisan. Thus five of the princes offered their dedication sacrifices during the time of the festival seasons. Those who have this opinion believe that if the priests were occupied with the dedication sacrifices of the princes they had no time to offer the Passover sacrifices. According to Meijler this opinion holds that Scripture should have mentioned the Passover sacrifices along with the sacrifices offered by the princes on the days that coincided with Passover. This question relates only to I.E.’s point of view. According to the opinion that the “eighth day” fell on the first of Nisan, the princes finished bringing their dedication offerings on the 12th day of Nisan, three days before the start of Passover, and consequently there is no problem.</i> Israel observed the festival of Passover<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">88</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, they sacrificed the paschal lamb on the 14th of Nisan and ate its flesh on the night of the 15th. It should be noted that in Scripture, Passover refers to the 14th of Nisan, when the paschal lamb is sacrificed, and the feast of unleavened bread to the seven days which follow. See note 86.</i> in the desert of Sinai for only one night.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">89</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Num. 9:1-6. Scripture there tells us that Israel observed the Passover in the first month of the second year following the Exodus from Egypt. The feast of unleavened bread is not mentioned. It is I.E.’s contention that this is the only Passover that Israel celebrated during their sojourn in the wilderness of Sinai.</i> They did not keep the festival of unleavened bread,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">90</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Which begins on the eve of the 15th of Nisan and lasts for seven days. See Ex. 12:15.</i> for Scripture clearly states, <i>And it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee</i> [<i>into the land of the Canaanite</i>] (Ex. 13:5)…<i>Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread</i> (Ex. 13:6).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">91</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We thus see that the obligation to observe the feast of unleavened bread begins only when Israel enters the land of Canaan.</i> <i>And this day shall be unto you for a memorial</i> (Ex. 12:14) refers to the next generation. It commands the next generation to establish the day that Israel left Egypt, as a holy convocation. Look! They journeyed from Goshen on the first day.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">92</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, on the first of what would eventually be the seven days of the festival of unleavened bread, for Israel left Egypt on the 15th of Nisan. See Num. 33:3. I.E.’s point is that Israel did not observe the festival of unleavened bread till they entered Canaan. He points out that they did not keep this festival in Egypt where they could buy flour for their unleavened bread because they did not spend the seven days of the festival period in Egypt.</i> Furthermore, Israel did not have bread<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">93</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, flour. Hence they could not celebrate the festival of unleavened bread in the desert of Sinai.</i> from which to make unleavened bread for seven days in the desert of Sinai even though they were close to an inhabited place.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">94</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Where they could have bought provisions if they felt themselves obligated to do so.</i> It was a great thing that they found material out of which to make unleavened bread to eat with the bitter herbs and paschal lamb on the one night,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">95</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On which they celebrated the Passover. See note 85.</i> for they were a very great multitude of people. Now logically speaking, Moses offered the daily burnt offering<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ex. 29:38-42; Num. 28:1-8.</i> during the seven days of consecration and two lambs on the Sabbath day.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">97</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Num. 28:9,10.</i> He offered the Sabbath burnt offering and then the consecration burnt offerings on which day of the seven days of consecration fell on a Sabbath. All of this is correct. However, what shall we do with the dedication of the altar<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">98</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, the sacrifices offered for the dedication of the altar.</i> on the Sabbath day?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">99</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Each one of the 12 princes of Israel offered dedication sacrifices on each one of the 12 days following the seven days of consecration. See note 72. Now only those sacrifices mandated by the Torah may be sacrificed on the Sabbath. Personal offerings cannot be sacrificed on the Sabbath. Hence the question raised by I.E.</i> Some say that they skipped the Sabbath day.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">100</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The princes of Israel did not offer their dedication sacrifice on the Sabbath.</i> They only counted the days that they dedicated the altar.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">101</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, when the Torah tells us that the princes of Israel offered 12 sacrifices on the 12 days following the seven days of consecration it does not mean that they offered them on 12 successive days, for they skipped the Sabbath day.</i> Others say that the princes’ burnt offering was offered on the Sabbath.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">102</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See note 72.</i> However, the peace offerings<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">103</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Which the prince should have offered on the Sabbath. See note 72.</i> were slaughtered and eaten on the first day of the week. Their proof is as follows. The prince<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">104</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reference is not to any of the princes mentioned in our chapter but rather to the prince mentioned in Ezek. 46.</i> who sacrifices<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">105</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, the one who sends. <i>Vat. Ebr.</i> 38 reads, The prince, that is, the king.</i> offers six lambs on the Sabbath<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">106</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ezek. 46:4, <i>And the burnt-offering that the prince shall offer unto the Lord shall be in the sabbath day six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish</i>.</i> aside from the congregation’s burnt offering.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">107</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, aside from the congregation’s burnt offering, six lambs sent by the prince are sacrificed on the Sabbath. These six lambs are burnt offerings. We thus see that a prince’s burnt offering may be sacrificed on the Sabbath.</i> The first group<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">108</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The group mentioned earlier, who maintain that the princes did not offer their altar dedication sacrifices on the Sabbath.</i> says that when they circled Jericho for six days with the armed body in the lead<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">109</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Josh. 6:6-15.</i> they similarly skipped the Sabbath.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">110</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In order not to violate the Sabbath. This opinion apparently held that the Sabbath fell during the six days.</i> Behold, they circled Jericho for seven days.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">111</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Josh. 6:15. They circled Jericho once a day for six days and seven times on the seventh day. This opinion maintains that they did not circle Jericho for seven successive days, for if they had done so they would have desecrated the Sabbath. This interpretation maintains that <i>And it came to pass on the seventh day</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>) does not refer to the Sabbath but rather to the seventh day of circling. It should be noted that according to the rabbis, Jericho fell on a Sabbath. See <i>Tal. Jer. Sabbath</i> 1:5, <i>Seder Olam</i> 11, <i>Ba-Midbar Rabbah</i> 14:1; 23:6.</i> They say the same with regard to the fourteen days.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">112</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The 14 days comprised the seven on which King Solomon celebrated the dedication of the temple plus the seven days of Sukkot. See I Kings 8:65: <i>So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great congregation…before the Lord our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days</i>. They say that these 14 days were not celebrated back to back, for if they had been, then Israel would have eaten on the Day of Atonement. It should be noted that according to the rabbis these 14 days were celebrated back to back and that Israel ate on Yom Kippur that year. See <i>Mo’ed Katan</i> 9a. Also see Kimchi on I Kings 8:65.</i> They skipped the Day of Atonement and did not count it."

Hence Moses had already seen God’s glory (Krinsky). He was thus, as it were, a member of God’s house.</i> Now what happened when Aaron and his sons took down the veil of the screen<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">118</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Which separated the Holy from the Holy of Holies.</i> outside the place where the ark was kept?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">119</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Num. 4:5: <i>when the camp setteth forward, Aaron shall go in, and his sons, and they shall take down the veil of the screen, and cover the ark of testimony with it</i>.</i> How did they approach it?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">120</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since God’s glory was upon the ark.</i> I therefore say that Moses alone entered beyond the veil. Aaron and his sons then took down the screen, which is called the veil.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">121</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.E. interprets <i>parokhet ha-masekh</i> (the veil of the screen) as the <i>parokhet</i>, that is, the screen.</i> Moses used to take the screen and immediately cover the ark of the covenant with it so that Aaron and his sons would not see it. Scripture writes, <i>and they shall cover the ark of testimony</i> (Num. 4:5)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">122</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Translated literally.</i> because they assisted Moses. Others say that the priests covered the ark but did not face it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">123</sup><i class=\"footnote\">So that they would not gaze upon God’s glory.</i> Scripture states, <i>and there was fire therein by night</i>, and then goes on to say, <i>throughout all their journeys</i> (v. 38). This<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">124</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In addition to Num. 14:14. See below.</i> also indicates that at times the cloud journeyed at night.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">125</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Some conclude on the basis of the aforementioned that at times the cloud journeyed at night.</i> Now we do not find it written that they journeyed at night.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">126</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Scripture never explicitly states that Israel journeyed at night.</i> The one who says this<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">127</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That Scripture never explicitly states that Israel journeyed at night.</i> explains <i>or if it continued by day and by night</i> (Num. 9:21) as referring to one day.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">128</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Num. 9:21 states, <i>And sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they journeyed; or if it continued by day and by night</i> (o yomam va-laylah), <i>when the cloud was taken up, they journeyed</i>. Now <i>o yomam va-laylah</i> can be translated in two ways: a) Or it continued by day and by night. b) Or it continued for a day or for a night. According to the latter translation our verse reads, “or if it continued by day or by night (o <i>yomam va-laylah</i>) when the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.” Thus the verse teaches that Israel at times traveled at night. Hence those who maintain that Israel did not journey at night interpret <i>o yomam va-laylah</i> as referring to a 24-hour period, that is, a day and a night. This opinion interprets <i>o yomam va-laylah</i> as: or it continued by day and by night, that is, a full day consisting of a day and a night.</i> Now what will they do with the phrase <i>their journeys</i> (v. 38)? Scripture does not read: throughout all their encampments.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">129</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If Scripture intended to teach that they journeyed during the day and camped at night, then our verse should have read: For the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle by day, and there was fire therein by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their “encampments,” rather than <i>For the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle by day, and there was fire therein by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their “journeys.”</i> The latter implies that Israel journeyed at night.</i> The correct meaning of <i>or…by day and by night</i> is: or day and night; or: or day or night.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">130</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, Israel journeyed at night. Our text literally reads, “Its meaning is (<i>u-pirusho</i>), or day and night, or, or day or night.” This reading is a bit difficult. I.E. is trying to prove that Israel journeyed at night. Hence why mention the interpretation, or day and night (see note 122). Indeed, <i>Vat. Ebr.</i> 38 reads, “Its meaning is (<i>u-pirusho</i>), or day or night.” If we emend <i>pirusho</i> to <i>pirush</i> then our text reads, “The meaning of (<i>u-pirush</i>) <i>Or…by day and by night</i> is: or day or night.” This is probably the reading upon which our text is based, for <i>pirusho</i> seems to be a scribal error for <i>pirush</i>.</i> It is similar to <i>And he that curseth his father and his mother</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">131</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hebrew, <i>aviv ve-immo</i> (his father and his mother).</i> <i>shall surely be put to death</i> (Ex. 21:17).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">132</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Translated literally. The meaning of Ex. 21:17 is, And he that curseth his father “or” his mother shall surely be put to death. We thus see that the <i>vav</i> sometimes has the meaning of or. Similarly, <i>yomam va-laylah</i> is not to be rendered day and night but rather day or night.</i> I had to say this because I noticed that the prayer which Moses uttered on the occasion of the scouts states, <i>and thou goest before them, in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night</i> (Num. 14:14).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">133</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This verse implies that Israel journeyed at night, for <i>prima facie, and Thou goest before them</i> also refers to <i>and in a pillar of fire by night</i>.</i>"
