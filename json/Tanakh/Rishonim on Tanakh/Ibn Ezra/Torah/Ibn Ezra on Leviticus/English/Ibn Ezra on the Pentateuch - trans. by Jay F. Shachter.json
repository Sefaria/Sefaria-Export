                "Just as the covenant of circumcision serves two distinct purposes [Genesis 17:1; Genesis 17:11], so it is possible for a single commandment to serve many different purposes — like the commandments of the burnt-offering and other sacrifices: 1) In offering up the appropriate portion at the appropriate time, we who have a portion in the world to come are apportioned proportionately. Thus the word “to atone” literally means “to ransom” (this is evidenced in the beginning of the <i>parasha</i> of <i>Ki Tis̀s̀a</i> [Exodus 30:12], and it explains the phrase “lest he strike us with pestilence” [Exodus 5:3]). 2) The burnt offerings also contain profound allusions to natural history. 3) By studying each sacrifice, one may come fundamentally to understand the nature of sin, and the nature of our obligations to sustain the teachers of the Torah. God <b>called to Moshe</b> Since Scripture has already stated that “Moshe was not allowed…” [Exodus 40:35], God must have called him from within the Tent of Assembly, telling him to enter therein, where He would speak to him. Moshe used to go behind the Partition, where the Glory resided (for so it is written [Exodus 25:22]). The reason for mentioning the sacrifices before the other commandments is that the Divine Presence would depart if they did not keep the law of the daily burnt-offering (which eventually happened). Perish the thought that God should <i>need</i> a burnt-offering! As it is written: “If I were hungry, I would not tell you” [Psalms 50:12]. The subject is admittedly too profound to explain easily."

Once a certain Sadducee [a derogatory reference to a Karaite — Translator] approached me and asked if the Torah forbade eating the fat-tail. I told him the truth, saying that although the fat-tail falls within the category of suet (as it is written: “its suet: the entire fat-tail…” [3:9]), our ancestors permitted it to be eaten and forbade all other suet. He then replied, Doesn’t the Torah prohibit <i>all</i> suet? — for it is written: “Eat no suet or blood” [3:17]; and this injunction is preceded by, “it is an everlasting decree for your generations…” [3:17]. I answered that the abovementioned verse appears in the context of the peace-offering. The phrase, “it is an everlasting decree for your generations in all your dwelling places” is not an irrefutable proof of his thesis, since Scripture also says, “You will eat [from the new crop] neither bread, nor parched grain, nor kernels, until that very day, until you bring the offering of your God” [23:14] — and there Scripture <i>also</i> says, “it is an everlasting decree…”. By this reasoning, we may not eat bread in Exile, since we have not brought the ‘Omer offering! He continued to argue, citing, <b>Never eat the suet of cattle, sheep, and goats</b>. I continued to refute him, pointing out that this verse also appears in the context of the peace-offering. My evidence is the qualifier in “Whoever eats the suet of animals that are brought as offerings to God” [:25]. Consider the consequences of his reasoning: the abovementioned qualifier is now needed only to exclude from the prohibition all meat that is not brought as a peace-offering (i.e., ordinary meat). Accordingly, this <i>parasha</i> specifies that <b> the suet of an animal that dies by itself</b> [Hebrew: <i>neveylah</i>] <b>and the suet of an animal that has been torn</b> [Hebrew: <i>ṭereyfah</i>] <b>may be used for any purpose other than eating</b> . The meat of a <i>neveylah</i> and of a <i>ṭereyfah</i> are elsewhere known to be forbidden [Deuteronomy 14:21; Exodus 22:30]; but it is the <i>meat</i> that is prohibited. Since the suet of such an animal is not brought on top of the Altar, one might think that it is permissible for food — hence the verse admonishes, <b>other than eating</b> . Consequently, Scripture did not need to repeat the prohibition against blood; and this passage was written to teach us the punishment for eating the suet of sanctified animals. Likewise, the verse <b> Nor will you eat blood…</b> exists only to incorporate birds in the prohibition — this is why the suet of birds is permissible [Karetot 4a]. The conclusive proof is that the Book of Deuteronomy mentions that meat of luxury (i.e., ordinary meat) is completely permissible, and in three different places excludes only the blood [Deuteronomy 12:23; 12:24; 12:25] — without <i>any</i> mention of suet! At this point the eyes of the Sadducee [a derogatory reference to a Karaite — Translator] were opened, and an oath escaped his lips, that he would not rely on his own reasoning for the derivation of the Commandments, but that he would depend on the exegesis of the traditional commentators."

Scripture says, “The children of Israel wept for Moshe…thirty days.” [Deuteronomy 34:8] — was there never a moment when they were not crying? By saying that they should stay in the entrance to the Tent of Assembly day and night [:35] Scripture means only to say that they should not concern themselves with other business, and that they should not take walks to any other places.

God <b>has commanded</b> Where was this made explicit? In the passage “Thus shall you do for Aaron and his sons, according to all that I have commanded you, for seven days…” [Exodus 29:35], and furthermore, “You shall offer a bullock as a sin-offering by day” [Exodus 29:36] (the phrase “by day” here means “day by day”, as in “two daily: this is the perpetual burnt-offering” [Numbers 28:3]). Scripture continues with the words “you shall sprinkle the blood of the sin-offering … and anoint it” [Exodus 29:26] — this is to be done daily, until the end of the consecration period — and finally “Seven days you shall perform atonement on the altar” [Exodus 29:27]. Notice that this passage employs brevity, and does not explicitly mention the two rams. Many people consequently arrived at the opinion that only the bullock sacrifice was repeated throughout the seven-day period. However, I believe that Scripture singles out the bullock sacrifice because the upcoming passage deals with the sanctification of the altar. The ram burnt-offering provided blood which was sprinkled on Aaron and on his sons, while the second ram provided meat to be eaten; but only the bullock sin-offering secured atonement for the altar. For this reason, the bullock offering is described “with atonement” [Exodus 29:36] — i.e., for the sake of atonement."

The same is also true of the explanation which I mentioned above, since in all of Scripture we do not find the <i>heh</i> of the definite article used as a relative pronoun in conjunction with a verb in the future tense. If the former Exegetes are correct, then we must translate <b>if I were to eat</b> — using the future tense as the subjunctive.

Sa‘adya Gaon said that <b>‘Azazel</b> is the name of a mountain, so called because it is mighty [Hebrew: <i>‘az</i>]. A divine name [Hebrew: <i>’el</i> , powerful] appears as a suffix, in the sense of “the great mountains” [Psalms 36:7] and “Yequti’el” [literally, “hope in the Mighty One”] [I Chronicles 4:18]. The Gaon Halevy held that the word <b>‘Azazel</b> does not contain such a suffix, because its <i>’alef</i> appears between two <i>zayin’s</i> . Some say that this mountain is near Mount Sinai, and that God commanded us to lead the goat up the mountain and to slaughter it there. Afterward, during the time of the Second Temple, the goat used to be led to a different mountain. The evidence that the particulars were reinterpreted is the otherwise superfluous verse “Aaron did everything…” [8:36]. In my opinion the festival of Shavu‘ot was treated similarly, as I shall explain in its place [<i>comment on</i> 23:11]. One commentator has pointed out that the service in the Second Temple differed from the service in the First Temple: the High Priest lacked certain garments, and there was no ark-cover. He suggested that, originally, the scapegoat was sent into the <i>wilderness</i> , for so it is written: “he will send the goat into the desert” [:22]. The purpose is the same as that of the bird send “into the fields” [14:7] — an uninhabited place — in the case of someone purifying himself from <i>ṣara‘at</i> . As conclusive evidence, he cites the phrase “to a barren region” [:22]. We may rebut this argument thus: The goat is first sent into the wilderness, as it is written. It is then pursued until it flees atop a high rock — at which point, in the words of our Sages, “he pushes it from behind” [Yoma 67a]. Gaon Shmu’el ben Ḥofni HaKohen has said that, although the sin-offering goat is marked <b>for</b> God, the scapegoat is also for God.

The <i>parasha</i> of <i>Qedoshim</i> begins with the commandment, <b>each of you will revere</b> [<i>plural</i>] <b>his mother and father</b> . Scripture has already said [Exodus 20:12] that whoever <i>honors</i> his parents will enjoy long life; consequently, whoever <i>dishonors</i> his parents shortens his life, and Scripture accordingly tells us to fear our parents as well as to honor them. The verse mentions the mother before mentioning the father, because a child at first recognizes only his mother. Later, he recognizes his father. Afterwards he recognizes the Sabbath (it is incumbent upon a child to observe the Sabbath, unlike the remaining festivals). Eventually he will come to recognize his God, Who rested on the seventh day. The next logical obligation is “Do not turn to the idols” [:4]. We know from tradition what constitutes “reverence” of one’s parents. Scripture employs brevity by using only one instance of the word <i>’ish</i> to signify <b>Each of you</b> [Hebrew: <i>’ish ’ish</i>]. The plural form of the verb <b>revere</b> informs us that anyone who sees the law being broken must teach and compel the lawbreaker to change. The same principle applies to keeping the Sabbath, since the plural form <b>you shall observe</b> is used.",

This rule is obeyed everywhere. Others say that <i>biqqoret</i> comes from “the kohen will not seek” [Hebrew: <i>yevaqqer</i>] [13:36], meaning, to search for something. The Exegetes have said that she is flogged with a strap made of cowhide [Hebrew: <i>baqar</i>]. Although this is true on the basis of tradition, the etymology is only a mnemonic.

It applies only in the vicinity of the Sanctuary, and this is borne out by Sha ul’s words [I Samuel 14:34], for he had the Ark with him [I Samuel 14:18]. By saying [I Samuel 14:33] that they were “eating on blood”, it is as if Scripture accused them of eating sacrifices to the satyrs. As I have explained, it was an Egyptian custom to offer sacrifices to demons; and if one has not dashed the blood against the Altar in the name of God, it is apparent that one is eating in the name of demons. For this reason the commandment is juxtaposed to <b>Do not believe in omens:</b> The Egyptians used to eat on blood, and stray after the demons; the Canaanites used to believe in omens, and in propitious times (as it is written [Deuteronomy 18:14]). Once again Scripture associates Egyptian and Canaanite practices, as expressed earlier by “the deeds of the land of Egypt…the deeds of the land of Canaan” [18:3]. People look for omens to test things about which they are uncertain, as in “I have tested you by divination, and have established that God has blessed me…” [Genesis 30:27].

In my opinion the word derives from “cloud” [Hebrew: <i>‘anan</i>]. It is well known that people perform divination on clouds, by observing their shapes and their movements.

                "Scripture now discusses festivals. The Sabbaths were called “ <i>My</i> chosen times” [:2]; the festivals are called <b>their chosen time</b> , because God does not determine the day of the week on which they fall. Allow me at this point to present a few general principles concerning the festivals. In the days when the Temple still stood, the Sanhedrin determined when the festivals would be held. Consider the case of King Hezekiah’s Passover, where Scripture clearly says “The king had taken counsel…” [II Chronicles 30:2]. The Exegetes tell us that the Sanhedrin would examine many factors when determining the length of the year. For example, Rabbi ⊂ Aqiba is said to have decreed two [actually three — Translator] leap years in a row [Sanhedrin 12a], because the situation required it. In all of Scripture we find no evidence of the procedure whereby ancient Israel maintained its calendar. Sa‘adya Gaon claims that they made the calendar conform to the same fixed rules that we now employ; but this cannot be true, as the Mishna and the Talmud both record that Passover occasionally used to fall on Monday, Wednesday, or Friday. Two stories tell of the occurrence of such events. Today we add a leap month whenever the lunar year falls approximately one month behind the solar year, but in ancient times this was not the case. The Jewish calendar began on a Friday morning at 8 o’clock (by adding 4 days, 8 hours, 48 minutes and 40 seconds to Sunday night, 11 minutes and 20 seconds past 11 o’clock in the evening, we get 8 o’clock Friday morning ), and the first intercalation occurred one and a half years later. Nowadays, the calendar is based on the average duration of the moon’s orbit. Although the interval between two <i>appearances</i> of the new moon is “sometimes longer and sometimes shorter” [Rosh HaShana 25a] than a lunar month, the actual sighting of the moon over Jerusalem (or over any other place) does not occasion the declaration of the new month. To prove this, assume that the midpoints of the sun, moon, and earth are all connected by a straight line. Is Jerusalem necessarily the place where this line intersects the earth’s surface? Moreover, whenever we see the new moon of Nisan on a Sunday night — and everyone around the world sees the new moon at the same time — the month of Nisan does not begin until Monday night. The months of Ṭevet, Sh e vaṭ, and Adar can likewise be delayed one day after the sighting of the new moon. This can happen whenever the New Year is delayed two days, because the new moon of Tishrey falls on Tuesday morning, after 03:11:20. There are also occasions when the month of Tishrey begins on Thursday, but the moon remains invisible even as late as Friday night and even if the sky is clear: Whenever the new moon occurs close to midday, the strong light of the sun renders it invisible, because the new moon is always in the same part of the sky as the sun. Even the astronomical moment when the moon is directly between the sun and the earth does not always determine the start of a new month. In particular, the New Year following a leap year is always postponed one day whenever this moment occurs on a Monday morning, after 09:38:16⅔. It is also postponed, as was mentioned earlier, when the moment of collinearity occurs on a Tuesday morning, after 03:11:20. Were it not for my unwillingness to digress, I would explain the mysteries of intercalation, and the little-understood laws regarding a new moon that occurs before midday. The main point is that our Sages, of blessed memory, have transmitted to us the law that in Exile we are to base our calendar completely on a fixed set of rules. This tradition dates back to the time of the prophets, and we cannot improve upon it. The practice of observing two-day festivals in the lands of Exile originally arose because of uncertainty over when the month began. Nowadays some people fast two days on Yom Kippur, in order to conform both to the calculated New Moon and to the astronomical New Moon. Such fasting does them no good, however, because the New Year is often delayed two days after the new moon appears. Suppose a month “ought” to begin with the new moon. Whenever the new moon of Tishrey occurs on Tuesday morning, after 03:11:20, then they “ought” to fast on the eighth day of Tishrey. Thus, why should we subvert the rules which have been handed down to us, for the sake of creating an entirely different calendar? — for that is what will happen if we conform our calendar to the sighting of the new moon."

                "<b>the day after the day of rest</b> [literally: the day after the Sabbath] Our Sages, of blessed memory, have said [Menaḥot 65b] that this denotes the second day of the festival; the Dissenters maintain that the verse should be taken literally. The faithful bring examples from the Sabbatical Year [25:2], the Jubilee, Yom Kippur [:32], and the New Year [:24], all of which are called “sabbath”. The first and the eighth days of Sukkot are called “sabbath” [:39], too [<i>see also comment on</i> Exodus 31:13]. Moreover, a “sabbath” also means a “week”, as in “seven sabbaths” [:15] as well as “those who came in on the Sabbath, along with those who had finished for the week” [II Kings 11:9] (where one verse uses two different meanings of the same word ). In addition to these definitive arguments, Meshullam ben Qalonymus of Rome attempted to bring a proof from “…on the day after the Passover, maṣṣot and toasted grain” [Joshua 5:11] without realizing that he thereby weakened his own argument. The Passover sacrifice occurs on the fourteenth of the month; the day after the Passover sacrifice is the <i>first</i> day of the festival, as it is written: “They marched from Rameses, in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month, the day after the Passover” [Numbers 33:3]. However, the eating of parched grain is forbidden until after the ‘Omer-offering has been waved! To resolve this, Sa‘adya Gaon proposed 1) that there are <i>two</i> Passovers: the first is Israel’s Passover, while the second is God’s Passover, and is observed on the evening of the fifteenth. Thus, the reference to “the day after Passover” in Joshua is a reference to the sixteenth of the month, but the reference to “the day after Passover” in the Torah denotes the day after the Passover <i>sacrifice</i> . This explanation is unsatisfactory, because the Passover festival owes its name to God’s passing over our houses. “The day after” that event denotes the following morning — which is still the fifteenth (compare, “…the entire day, the entire night, and the entire day after” [Numbers 11:32]). 2) Sa‘adya Gaon also suggested that the “maṣṣot and toast” were from the previous year’s crop, which makes sense. Scripture says that the waving of the ‘Omer offering takes place “from the time when you begin to reap the grain” [Deuteronomy 16:9]. If the waving of the ‘Omer that year occurred on the fifteenth, when did they have time to harvest the grain and prepare maṣṣot? Even if they had had the time, the only harvest so far that year was the beginning of the barley crop. The choice of words is also suggestive: Scripture says, “from the land through which they had passed [Hebrew: <i>‘avur</i>]” [Joshua 5:11]; the word may have been used because it describes the produce from the year that had just passed [Hebrew: <i>‘avra</i>] (“the land through which they had passed” literally means the land of Siḥon and ‘Og). This is borne out by the contrasting phrase, “…from the fresh produce of the land of Canaan” [Joshua 5:12]. Besides, “toast” [Hebrew: <i>qaluy</i>] is not the same thing as “parched grain” [Hebrew: <i>qalee</i>]. Scripture states only that “You will eat neither bread, nor parched grain [Hebrew: <i>qalee</i>], nor kernels” [:14]. The verse “ripe ears toasted [Hebrew: <i>qaluy</i>] in fire” [2:14] does not contradict anything we have said, because there the word <i>qaluy</i> is used as an adjective. Anything which is “toasted” in fire can be called “toast”. We may press the question still further: What grounds have we to assume that the kohen waved the ‘Omer offering as soon as they crossed the Jordan? In fact, the verse distinctly says “the land which I give you” [:10] and the land as yet had not been given to them. The entire point of the verse in question is that the manna stopped; Scripture mentions the maṣṣot and the toast only in the context of the stopping of the manna. Sa‘adya Gaon also pointed out, that if we are to take the word “Sabbath” literally, from <i>which</i> Sabbath are we to begin the count? Rabbi Abu al-Faraj Furqan ibn Asad replied that there are eighteen days called “set times”, besides the Sabbath, when an additional sacrifice is offered [Numbers, Chapters 28 and 29]. Since we know that an additional sacrifice is offered on the day the ‘Omer is waved [:12], we can deduce that the day of the ‘Omer waving must be included in the days of the Spring festival. He seems to have forgot, however, that the New Month sacrifices are also not mentioned in the list! Moreover, Scripture says, “These shall be offered each day for seven days” [Numbers 28:24]. According to him, it should say, “…except for the day on which the ‘Omerwaving falls” (the absence of such a phrase poses no problem for <i>us</i> , though, because we derive the Commandments from the oral tradition). The <i>parasha</i> of <i>Pinḥas</i> also does not discuss the lambs of the peace-offering [<i>cf</i> . :19] when it comes to the festival of Shavu‘ot, nor does it say anything about the “one young ox, and two rams” mentioned in the previous verse [:18] — instead, it talks about “two … bullocks, and one ram” [Numbers 28:27]. The believer can also argue that Moshe knew prophetically that the first day of the month would be a Sabbath, and consequently he would know on what day of the week the ‘Omer waving would fall (just as he would know that the first arrangement of the showbread would occur on a Sabbath [24:8] [<i>comment on</i> Exodus 40:2]). Scripture mentions the days on which events fell during the first year; but subsequent years use the terms “your Festival of Weeks” [Numbers 28:26] and “seven weeks” [Deuteronomy 16:9] rather than speaking in terms of “Sabbaths” [:15]. Similarly, in the first year they offered the sacrifices mentioned here; but in subsequent years they offered the sacrifices in the <i>parasha</i> of <i>Pinḥas</i> . It is useless to say that a “week” perforce begins on Sunday. The phrase “she will be ritually impure for two weeks” [12:5] clearly invalidates such an argument. Most people do not realize that the reason why Scripture does not mention the day on which Shavu‘ot falls — alone among all the festivals — is that we are commanded to <i>count</i> to the day of the festival. Our Sages, of blessed memory, said [Shabbat 86b] that the day on which Shavu‘ot falls is the anniversary of the giving of the Torah, and that the statement “we have a festival of God” [Exodus 10:9] is a reference to Shavu‘ot.",

Also, the barley ripening begins a new agricultural year, followed by “the first-fruits of the wheat harvest” [Exodus 34:22], and followed in turn by “when you gather your products” [Exodus 23:16].

Elsewhere it is called “a day of sounding the horn” [Numbers 29:1], because on this day (as on Yom Kippur of the jubilee year [25:9]) there is a separate commandment to blow the ram’s horn. Attend carefully now, and perhaps you shall understand the mysteries which I now reveal. The Exegetes have said that Rosh HaShana is the Day of Judgment, and that the ram’s horn reminds us of God’s majesty. Although every new month is heralded by the blowing of trumpets, the month of Nisan is preeminent over them all. On the first of Nisan the Tabernacle was erected; so it will also be in the future, as Ezekiel says: “in the first month, on the first day of the month” [Ezekiel 45:18]. He also says, “and so shall you do on the seventh day of the month” [Ezekiel 45:20] and on that day the sun and the moon are at right angles to one another. The festival on the fifteenth of Nisan occurs when the sun and the moon are directly opposite one another. The seventh day of the festival occurs when the sun and moon are again at right angles to one another. Accordingly, Rosh HaShana is the most important <i>day</i> of the year. Although it is a Day of Judgment, one may not fast on it, as Ezra showed us [Nehemiah 8:10]. Yom Kippur comes next, when the Moon is in conjunction with Aquarius, and then comes Sukkot, which is just like Passover except it has eight days instead of seven. Thus the mystery of the festivals and the mystery of the Sabbath are now clarified [not quite — Translator]."

If someone removed one-third, say, of another person’s eyelid, how could one possibly give the guilty party precisely that wound? Accordingly, the words of the tradition [Bava Qama 83b] must be correct. The true explanation in all these cases is that the guilty party <i>deserves</i> to lose an eye, but instead, he pays its monetary equivalent. If people should ask, “what if the guilty party is poor?” we answer that the law deals with the cases that are likely to occur. Besides, we can throw the question back at the questioners: What if the guilty party is blind? At least a poor person can conceivably become rich!

Scripture also employs brevity in the previous verse by not mentioning “whoever strikes a man <i>and kills him</i> will be put to death”. Such a qualifier is unnecessary, since it is obvious that the guilty party is not executed unless the victim dies. Another possible explanation: Scripture first uses the term “strikes fatally” [:17] to describe someone who strikes a person in a sensitive area. Later, Scripture gives the general principle that whoever kills another must be executed, whether he struck him in a sensitive area or not.

We need not dwell on the topic, since the Exegetes have established [Rosh Hashana 27a] that we recite “This day, the anniversary of the first day of creation” in the Rosh HaShana prayer [<i>Musaf ‘Amida</i> for Rosh HaShana]. Moreover, we see in the current verse that one blasts the horn of the jubilee year in Tishrey — namely, toward the beginning of the year. We also have the passage “Assemble the people…” [Deuteronomy 31:12] which tells us to read the Torah during the Sukkot festival. There the verse says “…that they may hear, and that they may learn” [Deuteronomy 31:12], and it is unlikely that this should take place after half of the year has elapsed. In addition, Scripture uses such phrases as “the harvest festival, at the end of the year” [Exodus 23:16] and “at the turn of the year” [Exodus 34:22]. The definitive proof, however, is the Sabbatical year, regarding which Scripture says, “Do not sow” [:11]. Now, the sowing season in the land of Israel begins in the month of Marḥeshvan. If the year were to begin in Nisan, then we could not harvest that which we planted in the sixth year. We could not plant on the following year (because it is the Sabbatical year), and since we could not harvest what was sown in the sixth year, it would be for all practical purposes as if we could not sow for two years in a row. Scripture, however, only tells us not to sow during the seventh year. Y e hudah HaParsi said that Israel used to follow a solar calendar. If this were true, then Moshe could not have taught us the exact length of a year, concerning which even today’s astronomers have been unable to reach an agreement. Not only do we rely on our tradition, but the very etymology of the word “month” also disproves HaParsi’s thesis. The Sadducees [a derogatory reference to Karaites — Translator] claim that a “year” in our religion is a lunar year; but the term “year” does not even apply to the moon (just as the term “month” does not apply to the sun). Rather, by dividing the length of a month into the length of a year, people figured out that a year is approximately 12 months long. The remainder from this division was divided into the length of a lunar month, in order to calculate the fraction of a month left over, so that our months would be lunar months while our years would eventually conform to the solar year. Our Sages, of blessed memory, have accordingly transmitted to us a tradition, dating back to the times of Moshe, that the Sanhedrin must decree seven leap years in every 19-year cycle (even though the months themselves were proclaimed upon observing the new moon). The mysteries of the 19-year cycle can be derived from the science of astrology [<i>cf. comment on</i> Exodus 12:2].",

Thus from the age of one month until the age of five years, one must give five <i>sheqalim</i> — even for someone only one day older than one month, one must give five <i>sheqalim</i> . Sa‘adya Gaon believed, however, that one must give one <i>sheqel</i> for every year of age, up till and including the age of five. Nevertheless, the majority opinion is that there are four fixed valuations (corresponding to the four stages of a person’s life). The second stage extends up to and including the age of nineteen, and the third stage extends up to and including the age of fifty-nine. Within each of these stages, one’s valuation always remains at the same level it assumed at the beginning of the stage. The fourth stage lasts roughly fifteen years, giving a total of seventy-five years for the four stages of life. The truth is that one passes from each stage to the next at the exact number of years specified [⊂ Arakhin 18a]. One might entertain the supposition, however, that the passing of a single day in a year is as good as the passing of a year [e.g., Rosh HaShana 2b]. We need not depend on the tradition alone to refute this idea — we can simply point out, Why would it then be necessary to specify a lower limit of one month in the one month to five year interval? The period until five years, and the period until twenty years, might lead one to conclude that a man’s valuation goes up one <i>sheqel</i> every year until the age of sixty, at which point his valuation begins to decrease. One can answer the “one month” argument within the context of this supposition by stating simply that a person younger than one month has no valuation. However, what can one say about the period over sixty years? Does one continue to decrease the valuation <i>ad infinitum</i> ? Clearly, all of these alternate explanations are erroneous. The laws must be understood as Scriptural decrees. For this reason we cannot expect a consistent proportion between the valuation of a male and that of a female. After the age of sixty, the male valuation exceeds the female valuation by one-third; between the ages of five and twenty, the male exceeds the female by one half; from one month till five years, and also from twenty years to sixty years, the male exceeds the female by two-fifths."
