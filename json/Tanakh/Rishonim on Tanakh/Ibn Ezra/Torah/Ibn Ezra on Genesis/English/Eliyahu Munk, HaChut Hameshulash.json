                    "לא יחיה; I will kill that person. Other scholars understand the expression as a prayer . This is why Rachel died while Yaakov was still on his way to his home. If that were correct, the scholar in question should explain to me who prayed for the wife of Pinchas to die. (Samuel I 4,18. The woman in question also died in childbirth.) "

                    "ויבא לבן באהל יעקב, ובאהל לאה, ובאהל שתי האמהות, the two maidservants shared one tent between them, hence their tents are referred to in the singular. It is also possible that the Torah condenses, meaning that Lavan entered each of their tents separately. After that he went back once more to the tent of Leah. ויצא מאהל לאה, this also makes sense, as we may assume that Yaakov’s tent was in between the tents of Leah and Rachel [so that the shortest route to the tent of Rachel would have been to walk through the tent of Leah once more. Ed.] Personally, I think it is most likely that the Torah wanted to limit the narrative to as few words as possible. It did so in order to build to the climax of Lavan entering the tent of Rachel, who, as the reader knows already, harboured the Teraphim. Actually, Lavan started his search in the tent of Yaakov, followed by his search in the tent of Leah, followed by his search of the tent of Rachel. He turned to the tent of the servant maids last. By the time he arrived at Rachel’s tent, Rachel had already had the opportunity to hide the Teraphim under the saddle of the camel she was sitting on. "
