                    "Our sages have said that the [letter] <i>bet</i> was added, like the <i>bet</i> in <i>barishonah</i> (“in the beginning”) Bereshit 13:4, for you find “at the beginning (<i>rishonah</i>) they travelled” Bamidbar 2:9. But were that the meaning, the  <i>bet</i> would have been vocalized with a <i>kamatz gadol</i>. And there are those who say that [the word] <i>bereshit</i> always [appears in] attached [form], where the meaning is “at the beginning of the evening, or the night, or the darkness”. But behold, they forgot “he saw a beginning <i>reishit</i> for himself” Devarim 33:21. And there are those who say that the  <i>bet</i> is a subject without meaning. Their reason is that it is unthinkable that there is no beginning to the heavens and the earth. Therefore, it said “<i>bereshit</i>. But according to my opinion, it is indeed an attached form, like “At the beginning (<i>bereshit</i>) of the rule of Yehoyakim” Yirmiyahu 26:1. Now don’t wonder how can it be attached to a past tense verb [instead of a noun], for behold, thus: “At the beginning (<i>techilat</i>) spoke Hashem with Hoshea, and Hashem said to Hoshea” Hoshea 1:2, “The city (<i>kiryat</i>) where David camped” Yishayahu 29:1. The meaning [of this usage] will be explained for you in the second verse.",
                    "“Created” – Most commentators have said that creation means bringing forth something from nothing, and thus: “But if Hashem will created a creation” [referring to something never seen before] Bamidbar 16:30. But they have forgotten “And G-d created the crocodiles” Bereshit 1:21, as well as three times in the same verse: “G-d created man in His image…” Bereshit 1:27; “and Who creates darkness” Isaiah 45:7 – which is the opposite of light, which is something. Now here is the precise grammar of the word  <i>barat</i> - it has two meanings. One is as stated. The other: “He did not revive them with bread” Samuel II 12:17. In this second one, <i>aleph</i> is in place of  <i>hey</i>, for similar to it is “And the whole people came to revive David” – this is in the  <i>hif’il</i> verb construction. If it were with an  <i>aleph</i>, it would be like “To revive you from the beginning of every grain-gift of Yisrael” Samuel I 2:29. We also find [the same root] in the  <i>pi’el</i> verb construction: “You will clear for yourselves there” Joshua 17:15. It’s not like “choose for yourselves a man” Samuel I 17:8, rather like “And He BARAed them” Ezekiel 23:47. And its meaning is to cut, to place a divided border – and the enlightened will understand.",
                    "“E-lohim” – After we have found [the word] <i>e-loah</i>, we know that   <i>E-lohim</i> is its plural form, and the root [of this] is in the nature of language. For every language has a formal form. The way of expressing formality in non-Hebrew languages is by the lesser using the plural in the presence of the greater. In Arabic the way of formal expression is for the greater to speak, as royalty, in the plural. In the Holy Tongue, the way is to refer to the greater in the plural.  Like “master” (<i>adonim</i>), “owner” <i>b’alim</i>  as they said, “a harsh master” (<i>b’alim</i>) Isaiah 19:4, “his master (<i>b’alim</i>) shall take”. Likewise the word “upon him” (<i>alav</i>), “to him” (<i>elav</i>), “until him” (<i>adav</i>). For this reason does Scripture state “He created” and not “they created”. Now from a perspective of wisdom, we know that speech is called “lip” [Hebrew parallel to the English “tongue”] since people see that words emanate from there. Likewise, the supernal human soul is called “heart”, yet the heart is [part of the] body, since the heart is the first “chariot” for it. Now is called thus [“(<i>E-lohim</i>)”)since all the acts of Hashem are [delivered] into the hands of the angels, who do His Will. (I will explain a bit more of the secret of the Name on the verse “for My Name is within him” – Exodus 23:21). And pay no attention to the words of [Rav Sa’adiah] <i>Ga’on</i> who said that man is more prestigious than angels.  I’ve already explained in <i>Sefer HaYesod</i> that all his proofs are actually the opposite. Now we know that, amongst men, there are none more prestigious than the prophets, yet Yehoshua fell on his face before an angel of Hashem and prostrated himself, and said, “what is my master speaking to his servant” – Joshua 5:14. and likewise Zechariah and Daniel, but why should I go on? And the meaning of “G-d of hosts” is like “G-d of gods [masters]”. So the meaning of <i>E-lohim</i> is like “king”, and people who are involved in divine law will be called thus – but it is an adjective [lit. descriptive name], not a [true] noun – you won’t find any future or past forms. And don’t think that, since we find it written, “He makes the winds His angels” that  angels are [made] from fire and wind, for that is not the straightforward way of interpreting that verse. It’s rather that David spoke initially of the work of creation, beginning with light and saying, “He enwraps [in] light” and afterwards “He spreads out the heavens” – that is, the firmament, with the waters above it, and fire, snow and wind. He [then] said that the wind is Hashem’s messenger to go to any place He may send it, likewise is fire amongst His servants, and he said, “He founded the earth upon its elements” – this is regarding the dry land. Likewise is it written, “the stormy wind does His will” Psalms 148:8",
                    "The meaning of <i>et</i> is like the thing itself, yet indicating a direct object, like <i>et hashamayim</i>, and sometimes it is omitted, as in “since G-d created man” [with the  direct object indicator missing] – Deuteronomy 4:32. And at times it’s [even] found with the subject, as in “the lion came and <i>et</i> the bear” – Samuel I 17:34, but there are few of these. It can [also] be in place of “with” and in place of ‘from”.",
                    "“The heavens” – with the definite article, to indicate that that it’s speaking of those [heavens] which are visible, and [“heavens”] are always plural. And it's possible that it means, \"its domain\" – the domain of each one. The meaning of “heavens” is heights and elevation, and thus it is in Arabic, which is primarily based on the Holy Tongue. There are also “heavens of heavens”, but there is no singular form, like <i>rechayim</i> [“millstones”] and <i>tzohorayim</i> [“afternoon”]. People of stature will understand these secrets. Now the <i>Ga’on</i> says that the earth is like a point, and the heavens are like a thread encompassing it, and after these two were created, were everything within them [created], like water and fire. Others have said that the water was included with the earth, and the wind with the heavens. According to my opinion, these heavens and earth are [identical to] the firmament and the dry land, for only one things was created on each day: on the first day, light; on the second day, the firmament; on the third day, plants; on the fourth day, the luminaries, of the fifth day, and on the sixth day, the living things. The psalm mentioned [above] bears witness. And it’s impossible for the line which surrounds to precede the point, or for the point to precede the line, so therefore did they say that the heavens and the earth were created simultaneously. Bearing witness is “I call to them, they stand up together” – Isaiah 48:13.  Yet this proof is not [sufficiently] clear, for this is not the explanation of the verse, for how can He say “to them” when they are not!? And how can He call it <i>tohu</i>? Rather, its meaning is “I created them”, and at the time I call to them, they will both stand up before Me like servants to do My will”, as in “Your word is standing in the heavens” – Psalms 119:89. And afterwards he mentioned the earth, afterwards stating that both will arise to execute judgment as He commands them."
                ],
                [
                    "“And the earth” – this word is an unusual [form], since it appears with a <i>kamatz</i> in the <i>alef</i> when [preceded by] the <i>hey</i> [i.e., the definite article] in all places. It is not like “The thousand (<i>ha’elef</i>) for you, Shlomo” Song of Songs 8:12, or “and this stone <i>ha’even</i>” Genesis 28:22.",
                    "“Void” (<i>tohu</i>) – The <i>Ga’on</i> [Rav Sa’adiah] said that [this word] is from “deep” (<i>tehom</i>), but that is not possible, since the <i>mem</i> of <i>tehom</i> is a root letter, like the <i>mem</i> of <i>hadom</i>. Now in  <i>Sefer Yetzira</i>: “<i>tohu</i> - this [refers to] the green line”, and <i>bohu</i> - this [refers to] MEFULAM stones”. What’s correct is as the Aramaic translator has said, and likewise with “the howling, desolate <i>tohu</i> Deuteronomy 32:10, and likewise, “after <i>tohu</i>” Samuel I 12:21 – without substance. ",
                    "“And confused” – \"The brother of\", and the <i>vav</i> in place of the <i>hey</i>, like the <i>vav</i> in [the word] <i>vayishtachu</i> (“and he bowed”) Genesis 18:2, “and they pastured amongst he reeds (<i>achu</i>)” Genesis 41:2. The meaning is [as follows:] The creation of the firmament and the dry land was not in a area to be settled, since it was covered with water, and thus G-d placed its generative power to be beneath the water. Now don’t be surprised by the <i>vav</i> of <i>veha’aretz</i> (“and the earth’), for its meaning is like the <i>feh</i> in Arabic and like “and a mist” <i>v’ed</i> would rise up from the earth” Genesis 2:6, for Moshe did not speak about the World to Come, which is the world of the angels, but rather of this transitory world. And those who explain that the heavens in the first verse are really the heavenly heavens, what will they do [here] with the earth? Behold, complete proofs, for reasonable people, that there is only earth. Now it is expounded that there were seven earths is [actually] that the earth is divided into seven and the Temple was in the center of the settled region, for it was distant from the center of the earth. ",
                    "“And a spirit of G-d” – It juxtaposed “spirit” with the Name [of G-d] since it was an agent regarding the Divine will to dry the land. Water is plural form, with no singular, and both of them are in the dual construction, for they are both masculine and feminine. Yet it is found with a singular [verb] – “was not thrown <i>zorak</i> upon him” Numbers 19:13. The meaning of “hovering” – blowing above the water, and likewise, “over its hatchlings does it hover” Deuteronomy 32:11",
                    "And the meaning of \"hovers\".  Blows above the waters, like \"hovers over its chicks\"."

                    "“And He said” – The Gaon said that the meaning of <i>vayomer</i> (“And He said”) is like “and He desired”. But if this was so, it would have been appropriate for there to have been light [from the beginning, without darkness]. Rather, it’s in accordance with its [plain] meaning. And thus, “By the word of G-d were the heavens made” Psalms 33:6,  “for He commanded and they were created” Psalms 148:5, The meaning is: a way of referring to an effortless action, comparable to a king and his servants. Now this light was above the wind."

The meaning of “one day” is referring to the rotation of the sphere. There is a secret to the <i>midrash</i> of six thousand. And after it has said that the light is called day, it isn’t possible that the evening should be called day, rather its explanation is “it was evening and also morning of Day One”, for if it was [referring to] the evening and morning(g of one day, what would be the meaning of “a second day”?"

                    "“And He said”, the <i>Gaon</i> said regarding the firmament (<i>raki’a</i>) things that could not be; rather its explanation is “extended”, like “they were extended” (<i>vayerak’u</i>) Exodus 39:3, “I shall extend them” (<i>erka’em</i> Samuel II 22:43, and similarly, “and He stretched them [i.e., the heavens] out like a tent for dwelling”. Isaiah 40:22. And how profound is the word of the one who says that the edges of the sun are with the edges of the waters of the oceans. Now this firmament is the atmosphere, for when the light coalesced over the earth and a dry wind from the earth, the blade/flame was changed and became the firmament. And thus did it say in a Psalm Psalms 104:2 “He stretches the heavens like a curtain… the one who makes roofbeams of water”. And it mentions the clouds and the wind and the earth element, which is higher than the water, and thus it writes, “for He founded it upon the seas” Psalms 24:2, “the One Who extends the earth over the waters\" Psalms 136:6 and similarly, anyone who goes to the sea is called, “goes down”. The meaning of “the One Who calls to the waters of the sea” Amos 5:8 – so that they should ascend, referring to clouds, and afterwards, “and He pours them out”."

Now revealing a hidden thing and gathering that which is scattered is not creation [per se] (<i>beri'ah</i>). The meaning is then, \"G-d had already said, let the waters be gathered\", and there are hundreds of similar usages in the Torah.  In <i>parashat Bereshit</i> alone I will give you two witnesses. The first: \"And He placed there [in the Garden] the man whom He had formed\", while afterwards, \"And Hashem, G-d, caused to grow [from the ground every tree...]\" - but before [placing] man had He caused it to grow.

And they would [further] explain: In the image of G-d, that the word \"G-d\" is attached to the word \"made\", as though it said that G-d made man in an image. But this is an explanation which lacks sense [<i>haser lev</i>], for the first passage should then have been thus: \"And G-d said, 'let man be made'\", and likewise, He made him \"in his image\" - how can \"his\" (the <i>vav</i> of <i>b'tzalmo</i>) refer to man, for then, he would have had an image before he would be [created]! And [further], what reason would there be [in the verse] such that “the one who spills the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed” – because man was made in his own image? There was an image for all living creatures! Now the <i>Gaon</i> said that me explanaion of “in our image, after our likeness” is regarding dominion.

Similarly, “we shall give <i>nitnah</i> to you also this one” Genesis 29:27. “We say before the king” Daniel 2:36, “perhaps I will be able and we will smite him” Numbers 22:6. But these witnesses are false witnesses, for  <i>nitnah</i> is [actually] the <i>nif’al</i> verb construction, and similarly “the city is given” <i>nitnah</i> Jeremiah 32:24, and the <i>vav</i> converts it to the future tense, like is the rule with all past-tense verbs, meaning “she will be given to you”. And “we shall smite him” – he [Balak] and his camp, or it could be the infinitive of the verb, like “clease <i>nakeh</i>, I shall not clease you” Jeremiah 46:28. And even though we do find “they were not smitten” Exodus 9:32, [nevertheless], only that verb construction (<i>pu'al</i>) lacks an infinitive form – and R. Moshe of Spain erred in his book [on this matter]. And the word “we shall say (before the king)” Daniel 2:37 is Aramaic, and [further], how could Daniel speak hautily with Nebuchadnezzar, who was the king of kings? Now I shall explain: Know that all of the work of creation was created for the honor of man at the command of Hashem. The plants – the earth and the water brought them forth, and all the living souls [i.e., the animals]. And afterwards, Hashem said to the angels, “let US make man” – WE will busy ourselves with him, not the water and the earth. Now, since we know that he Torah speaks in the language of human beings, for the one who speaks is [as it were] a human [character], as well as the one who listens, and one cannot speak to one above or below his level, except by means of human imagery. Likewise, it says, \"the mouth of the earth\", \"the hand of the Jorden [river]\", \"the head of the ores of the earth\", and G-d forbid there should be [attributed] a physical form to Hashem, for thus it says: “to whom shall you compare Me?” Isaiah 25. Now since the human soul is most exalted, for it is immortal, it is compare in it livingness to Hashem, who is not corporal yet fills everything. Now the human body is like a microcosm. May G-d we blessed, Who began with the great and concluded with the small. Likewise did the prophet say that he saw the glory/manifestation of G-d like the image of man (see Ezekiel 1:28). Now Hashem is one, and He creates all, and He is all, and I cannot expound this further. Man was initially created as a dual-faced creature and yet he is one, and yet he is also two, and behold, an angel is in the image of G-d. He was created male and female. The word for “fruitfulness” and “multiplication” is a blessing, as with the creation of water, yet it is [also] a command as transmitted by our ancient [Sages], (may their remembrance be a  blessing!), and they used this verse as a mnemonic for this [matter]."

And the Gaon (a Babylonian Jewish leader) explained that the purpose of the test was to show His righteousness to the people. But the Gaon surely knew that when Avraham bound his son, no one else was there. And others say “go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the heights” meant to be “make a sacrifice upon the mountain.” And not him for sacrifice. And Abraham did not know the secret of the prophecy, and he hurried to slaughter him, and God said to him, “I did not ask for this.” All these wise leaders needed their interpretations because they couldn't believe that God would command a Mitzvah and then change it. But all those leaders did not notice that there is a precedent for a change like that. In the case of commanding a role for the first born male child (Bamidbar ג – Nombers 3) He replaces them with the Levites one year later. (And my understanding is) that the text of the Torah uses “נסה\" Test, and that is why we don't need to think that anything changed. God tested Avraham for the purpose of giving him a reward (and not for the purpose of commanding sacrifices or showing his righteousness)."

                    "The nature of a ladder [sulam] is a symbol [semel], or it is an explanation of the Gematria valuation of 'Sinai' (Genesis Rabbah 68:12-14). And Rabbi Shlomo HaSefardi said that 'ladder' hints at the highest soul and 'G-d's angels' hints at wise thoughts. Rabbi Joshua said that the reason for the ladder is that his (Jacob's) prayer rose on it and his salvation from the heavens came down on it. These explanations do not explain it in light of the prophecy of Zecharia (1:8), Amos (7:1), and Jeremiah (1:11). The reason for the ladder here is a metaphor, for nothing is concealed from G-d. Worldly things hang onto the heavens as though there is a ladder between them, upon which the angels go up to report on things after they have been walking along the earth. Likewise, it is written that other angels descend to fulfill G-d's tasks, like a king with his servants."
