            "Those who comment on the Torah do so in one of five ways.",
            "The first way (to Biblical interpretation) ranges far and wide (from the text). It is beyond the interest of our time. If truth be likened to a dot within a circle then this approach can be compared to the periphery of the circle, which goes round about only to return to its starting point. A number of great scholars chose this approach, namely, the wise men of the academies in Moslem countries, such as Rabbi Isaac<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is not clear which Isaac I.E. is referring to. Some identify him with the philosopher Isaac Israeli (c. 850-950). Cf. Weiser.</i> who composed two books on the first chapter of Genesis, from <i>In the beginning</i> to <i>were finished</i>, and did not finish his commentary, so verbose was he. He makes mention of the believers in a god of light and a god of darkness<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zoroastrianism (Weiser).</i> in his comments on the verse <i>Let there be light</i> (Gen. 1:3). But he (Rabbi Isaac) walked in darkness without being aware of it. In his comment on <i>And the earth brought forth grass</i> (Gen. 1:12), he brought forth words from his fancy<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, heart. He did not quote anyone but gave his own opinion or invented facts.</i> and spoke about trees and plants both large and small. On the other hand, on the term <i>living creature</i><sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Weiser.</i> he quoted foreign sciences. In the same vein, Rabbi Saadiah, Gaon of the Diaspora, commenting on the verse <i>Let there be lights</i> (Gen. 1:14), quoted the opinion of secular scholars and gave the dimensions of the heavenly bodies according to the astronomers. Similarly Rabbi Samuel ben Hofni <i>gathered wind in his fists</i> (chofnav) (Prov. 30:4)<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A play on the words <i>chofni</i> (Hofni) and <i>chofnav</i>.</i> in his lengthy comments on <i>And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba</i> (Gen. 28:10). He there mentioned every prophet by name, and how many times each one was exiled from his place. He also expounded on the value of travel. The only value of his commentary is its length. On the verse <i>And he dreamed</i> (Gen. 28:12) he expostulated on dream interpretation and why people see what they see when they are asleep. If one desires to learn secular wisdom let him learn it from the works of experts in these fields and let him examine their proofs and see if they are correct. The Geonim only cited from these works without offering any of the proofs as to the veracity of the opinions they quoted.<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reader thus has no way of knowing whether what is quoted is true or not.</i> Some of the Geonim had no knowledge of the method of the ancient sages and how they arrived at their conclusions.",
            "A second approach is the one chosen by the distorters, albeit they are Israelites. They think that they have reached the very point of the circle, but in reality they do not know its place. This is the way of the Sadducees,<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Karaites. The medieval rabbis called the Karaites Sadducees because like the Sadducees they denied the authority of the Rabbinic sages, the Mishnah and the Talmud.</i> such as Anan,<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The founder of Karaism. He lived in the 8th century.</i> Benjamin,<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Benjamin ben Moses Nahavendi (c. 9th century). He was the first Karaite scholar to write in Hebrew and was responsible for the term “Karaites” replacing “Ananites.”</i> Ben Mashiach, Joshua,<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Some of the printed editions omit Ben Mashiach and Joshua. Hasan ben Mashiach was a Karaite who engaged in polemics with Saadiah Gaon. Joshua was a Karaite scholar often quoted by I.E. It is suggested that the reference is to Joshua ben Judah Abu al-Farag Purkan, one of the founders of Karaism (Weiser).</i> and of all heretics who do not believe the words of the transmitters of tradition,<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rabbinic sages.</i> turning away from it to the right or the left.<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to Rabbinic tradition, the Biblical verse, <i>thou shalt not turn aside from the sentence which they shall declare unto thee, to the right hand, nor to the left</i> (Deut. 17:11), is a command to heed the words of the “transmitters of tradition.”</i> Each one interprets verses as he sees fit. They do the same even with respect to commandments and laws. They are ignorant of the form of Hebrew and therefore err even in grammar. How can people rely on their opinion, with regard to the precepts when they are always changing their mind, moving from one extreme to the other? They do this because there is not a single commandment fully explained in the Torah itself. I will note one example.<sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The “one example” offered by I.E. is, “Nowhere in the Torah do we find the rules governing the establishment of the years nor how to calculate months.” However, he digresses before coming to the point.</i> Someone conversant with these things will recognize its significance because it entails the penalty of <i>karet</i> (shortened life span) with regard to eating on Yom Kippur, eating leaven on Passover and, for one who is in a state of ritual purity on Passover, not offering the paschal lamb.<sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One who is “impure” on Passover is forbidden to sacrifice the paschal lamb. Cf. Num. 9:1-14. Our rendition is based on the Vatican manuscript of I.E. henceforth written <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38. The printed texts read, “and leavened bread on Passover which one in a state of purity did not observe.” This is an impossible reading.</i> It also involves the seven rest days of the festivals,<sup>19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There are seven festival days when work is Biblically prohibited. They are: the first and seventh day of Passover, Shavuoth, Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, the first day of Sukkot and Shemini Atzereth.</i> the festival sacrifices, dwelling in booths and the sounding of the shofar. Nowhere in the Torah do we find clearly stated the rules governing the establishment of years nor how to calculate months. These wretched, poor in learning, find support for their calendric calculations in the verse <i>and let them be for signs, and for seasons (festivals)</i><sup>20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew word for seasons is <i>mo’adim</i>. <i>Mo’adim</i> also means festivals. Genesis 1:14 reads, <i>Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven…and let them be for signs, and for seasons</i> (mo’adim). The Karaites interpreted this verse: Let them be for signs for the festival, i.e., let the moon (the lunar month) determine the time of the festivals.</i> (Gen. 1:14). But they don’t know that <i>Let them be</i> is in the plural and speaks about the sun, moon and stars.<sup>21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Scripture reads <i>ve-hayu</i> not <i>ve-hayah</i>. <i>Ve-hayu</i> is a plural and so cannot refer only to the moon.</i> As to the person who says that the <i>vav</i> of <i>u-le-mo’adim</i> (and for seasons) is superfluous and that <i>for signs</i> is connected to <i>for seasons</i>,<sup>22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Aside from the above, the verse presents another problem for the Karaites. It does not read: and let them be for signs for seasons (festivals). It reads: and let them be for signs <i>and</i> for seasons (festivals). The Karaites tried to get around the problem by claiming that the <i>vav</i> of <i>u-le-mo’adim</i> is superfluous and should not be translated. <i>U-le-mo’adim</i> should be rendered: for seasons (festivals) rather than: and for seasons. Thus the verse is to be translated: And let them be for signs for seasons (festivals).</i> let him search for a friend to tell it to; perhaps he will believe it. If we do find two or three superfluous <i>vavs</i>, how do we know that this is one of them,<sup>23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.E. concedes that there are a few superfluous <i>vavs</i> in Scripture, but he asks, how do we know that this is one of them?</i> since we find thousands of <i>vavs</i> in Scripture which have meaning? Furthermore, the verse <i>Who appointedst the moon for seasons</i> (le-mo’adim) (Ps. 104:19) is not in accordance with the interpretation of those whose loins totter.<sup>24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. Ps. 69:24. The Karaites interpreted Ps. 104:19 as meaning God appointed the moon for festivals.</i> Even if Scripture explicitly stated (which it never does) that the moon shall be for a sign for the appointed seasons (<i>mo’adim</i>) falling in the various months, how could we determine that the Bible speaks of God’s holy appointed seasons, since various types of appointed seasons are mentioned in the Pentateuch, the Prophets and the Holy Writings?<sup>25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The point is if the Bible said: the moon shall determine the <i>mo’adim</i>, how do we know that the <i>mo’adim</i> refer to religious festivals? The word <i>mo’ed</i> may refer to any appointed time and does not necessarily refer to a religiously appointed one.</i> Furthermore, even if the Bible explicitly said: let the moon be as a sign for God’s holy seasons,<sup>26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even if the Bible explicitly stated the moon shall be for a sign for God’s holy festivals, it would not solve the problem as to what constitutes a month.</i> a very important aspect of the problem remains to be solved.<sup>27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Namely, what constitutes a new moon (the beginning of a month)? In order to understand what follows it is necessary to have some idea of medieval astronomy. The daily movement of the moon varies between approximately 11 and 15 degrees in a rather complicated fashion. To explain these motions the ancients introduced a complex scheme of combined circular movements. (For a full discussion of this problem and the solution offered for it, see <i>Yale Judaica</i> series, Vol. XI, <i>The Code of Maimonides, Sanctification of the New Moon</i>, p. 126). Cherez explains that the moon was believed to move within four spheres. The first is called <i>galgal ha-domeh</i> (the all-encompasing sphere). It is so called because like the zodiacal sphere, it encompasses the whole world and like it has the earth as its center. This sphere turns from east to west. Within the all-encompassing sphere lies another sphere called <i>galgal ha-noteh</i> (the inclined sphere). This sphere is not contained within the <i>galgal ha-domeh</i> but intersects it. The chord connecting the points of intersection are called the <i>teli</i> (the dragon). The point at which the moon moves north of this intersection is called the head (or top) of the <i>teli</i>; its opposite point, where the moon moves south, is called the tail of the <i>teli</i>. The <i>galgal ha-noteh</i> is inclined five degrees above the <i>galgal ha-domeh</i> on the north and five degrees below it on the south, hence the term <i>galgal ha-noteh</i>. The center of this sphere is the same as that of the <i>galgal ha-domeh</i>. This sphere also turns in an east to west direction. Within the <i>galgal ha-noteh</i> is another sphere called the <i>galgal ha-yotze</i> (the eccentric sphere). It is so called because the earth is not the center of this sphere. It is also called the <i>galgal ha-noseh</i> (the carrying sphere) because it bears a sphere which the moon circles (the <i>galgal ha-katan</i> or epicycle). The <i>galgal ha-yotze</i> turns from west to east. These spheres move at different speeds and their movements explain the complicated motions of the moon.</i> Does a new moon start when the moon completes circling the sphere of the zodiac, i.e., every 27 days and some limited hours,<sup>28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is the time it takes the moon to return to a given point in the zodiac (Weiser). Medieval man believed that beyond the spheres of the moon, sun and planets there is a sphere containing the constellations. It takes the moon 27 and about a third of a day to complete this cycle (Weiser).</i> or when it completes circling the apogee of the eccentric sphere whose center is far from the center of the earth,<sup>29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The time it takes the moon to complete its epicycle within the eccentric sphere, i.e., every 27 days and about 13 hours. So Cherez. However, his interpretation is questionable.</i> or when it completes circling the sphere of the dragon according to the calculation of the wise men because its epicycle turns in the opposite direction.<sup>30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The moon in its epicycle turns from west to east while the “sphere of the dragon” rotates from east to west (Weiser). These contrary motions must be taken into consideration in establishing the time it takes the moon to complete the latter revolution. According to Krinsky what I.E. means by “the time it takes the moon to circle the sphere of the dragon” is the time it takes the moon to return to the head of the dragon after leaving it. It should be noted that the commentaries differ as to what I.E. means by the “sphere of the dragon,” as they do with regard to what he means by the moon’s cycle around the apogee of the “eccentric sphere” and indeed as to how I.E. envisioned the system of the lunar spheres cited in note 27. For their opinions and differences see, Joseph ben Eliezer Ha-Sephardi, <i>Margaliot Tuva</i>, Amsterdam, 1722; Hayyim Wolf Kaputa, <i>Or La-netivah</i>, Lemberg, 1897; Weiser and Cherez. While the specifics of I.E.’s comments are difficult to unravel, as is evidenced by the wide interpretation given his comments in the above-noted commentaries, the thrust of his remarks is clear. The moon makes a number of cycles in the sky. If a new moon is to be determined by the moon’s revolution, which one of its cycles is to determine the new moon?</i> On the other hand, it may be that the month depends upon the conjunction of the sun and the moon.<sup>31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A Hebrew month is determined by the conjunction of the sun and moon. Cf. Maimonides, <i>Mishneh Torah, Laws of Sanctification of the New Moon</i>, 6:1.</i> There are three such conjunctions: the mean conjunction,<sup>32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The mean conjunction of the sun and the moon takes place every 29 days, 12 hours, and 793 parts of an hour (dividing the hour into 1,080 parts). Cf. Weiser. The mean conjunction is the time when the sun and moon would come together if both moved uniformly.</i> the true conjunction<sup>33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The true conjunction of the sun and moon is their actual conjunction.</i> and the conjunction contingent on the place of the beholder.<sup>34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The conjunction varies in different places of the globe. See I.E.’s commentary on Ex. 12:2.</i> We do not know which conjunction determines the new moon; is it one or the other? As to that which they say, that the month begins when the new moon is actually seen, they have been deceived, for they have eyes but see not. Let them show us where in the Torah and the testimony<sup>35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A synonym for Torah.</i> it is stated that the new moon is to be so determined. Similarly they did not correctly comment on <i>This is the burnt-offering of every new moon throughout the months of the year</i> (Num. 28:14) because this verse does not mention the moon.<sup>36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Karaites interpreted <i>chodesh be-chodsho</i> to mean the moon when it is new. They claimed that <i>be-chodsho</i> is to be interpreted as <i>be-chiddusho</i> (when it is new). I.E. disagrees. He feels that <i>be-chodsho</i> means in its month, and furthermore, <i>chodesh</i> does not mean moon but month. Cf. I.E. on Num. 28:14.</i> It merely says that the various sacrifices are to be offered in their proper time and day and the Sabbath sacrifices on the Sabbath.<sup>37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Num. 28:10.</i> It is also known that sometimes there are six hours between the birth of the new moon and sunset. At such times the new moon can only be seen under certain astonomical conditions. At other times there may be a thirty hour difference between them,<sup>38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, the moon will not be visible at the first sunset following its conjunction with the sun.</i> and the moon will not be visible even to one standing on a mountain. This is so because the path of the moon changes due to its and the sun’s spheres.<sup>39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The ancients believed that the sun traveled around the earth. However, the earth was not the center of the sun’s orbit. When the sun is further from the earth, it appears to be traveling more slowly, when closer to the earth, faster (<i>Yale Judaica</i> series, Vol. XI, p. 126).</i> Its time of appearance also changes depending on the longitude and the latitude of the country from which it is observed. If it is cloudy and the new moon is not seen at the beginning of Elul or Tishri, shall we fast three days of atonement?<sup>40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The point is, if we do not rely on the traditional calculation and rely on the mean conjunction, then when for some reason the moon is not seen at the beginning of Elul we do not know when that month starts. If the same occurs with regard to Tishri, we have three possible dates for Yom Kippur, viz., when did Elul start and did it have 29 or 30 days? To satisfy all doubts we would have to fast three days in a row.</i> Furthermore, who says that a month consists of thirty days, for behold, Judah Ha-Parsi<sup>41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Judah Ha-Parsi was a Karaite who wrote a book claiming that the Pentateuch follows a solar year of 12 months, with each month consisting of 30 days. However, the Bible nowhere says that a month consists of 30 days. Cf. I.E.’s commentary on Ex. 12:2.</i> wrote a book in which he counted the year and the months according to a solar year. We also do not find in the Torah of Moses the law of witnesses testifying that they saw the new moon, or who is qualified to testify that he saw the new moon, or if one is permitted to walk a great distance on a holy day to testify that he saw the new moon,<sup>42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishnah, <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 1:5-8.</i> or if a father and son, or proselytes, or women are fit to testify that they saw the new moon. Even if all these things were written in the Torah, another problem remains. The Torah of Moses does not state how many months make a year. And even though the Torah connects the new year with the fresh young ears<sup>43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. Ex. 12:2, 13:4.</i> it is not clear whether it refers to the fresh young ears of the wheat<sup>44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The month of Sivan.</i> or barley,<sup>45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The month of Nisan.</i> or when during this period the new year is to start, or from where young fresh ears of barley are to be brought.<sup>46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Assuming that the new year starts with the ripening of the barley, what place is to determine its ripening and hence the spring? The barley ripens at different times in different places.</i> If there is a hunger in the land of Israel and its environs and there is no seed and certainly no fresh ears, what is to be done? In such a case shall we leave the year as it is or add an additional month?<sup>47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Perhaps we ought to add another month and see if something will grow and there will be fresh young ears. Cf. Weiser.</i> In such a year the Omer would not be counted and there would be no festival of weeks.<sup>48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since there is no barley. Cf. Lev. 23:9-22.</i> Therefore all these commandments are dependent on true traditions. Those who dispute what I have said and say, do not the sages of the Mishnah also teach that the months are determined by when the new moon is seen, to them I reply that if you accept their tradition as truth, that the month is determined by the sighting of the new moon, also accept their tradition that the needs of the people also determine the new moon. For the new moon is contingent upon its announcement by the Bet Din. The Bet Din took into consideration the time of the fresh young ears, the solstice and the needs of the community<sup>49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <i>Sanhedrin</i> 11b.</i> in determining whether to add an additional month. Why, with regard to the laws of plagues, which apply only to individuals and very rarely at that, does the Torah go into such great detail? And yet with regard to the laws of the calendar, which determine the festivals that apply to all Israel at all times, there is no clear-cut statement so that we must look for hints here and there as to how the month is to be determined. Why is this so in this perfect Torah? This is ironclad proof that Moses relied in these matters on the oral Torah which is a gladness to the heart and a healing to the bones. In reality, there is no difference between the written and oral <i>Torot</i>. They were both handed down to us by our ancestors. The Passover observed by King Hezekiah supports our faith in the Rabbinic tradition. It was done so on the advice of wise elders. Hezekiah did not offer the paschal lamb in its time and he presumed to eat leaven in the first month. He observed the “second Passover” for seven days, in a manner similar to the “first Passover.”<sup>50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hezekiah put off the observance of Passover for a month upon the advice of “his princes and all the congregation in Jerusalem.” Cf. II Chron. 30:2. This supports the teaching of the Oral Law to the effect that a Bet Din may delay observance of Passover for a month if it is felt that the needs of the community warrant it. Otherwise, Hezekiah would have been guilty of eating leaven on Passover. Furthermore, he would have invented a new way to celebrate the Second Passover. Cf. Num. 9:9-13. For the Second Passover is observed for one night and Hezekiah kept it for seven days. Since Hezekiah was a pious king we must assume that the festival he observed was not the Second Passover but the Passover itself after an extra month was added (intercalated) to the year.</i> There is ample proof that the Most High and Exalted One accepted what he did. This was so because his actions were based on the ruling of a Bet Din. There was no deceit in him.",
            "The third approach is the way of darkness and gloom. It lies outside of the circle. This is the approach of those who invent secret explanations for everything in Scripture. They believe that the laws and statutes of the Torah are riddles.<sup>51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.E. takes issue with those who interpret the Torah as allegories. In I.E.’s alternate commentary on the Pentateuch this group is identified as the Christians.</i> I will not expend much time answering them for, <i>they are a people who do err in their heart</i> (Ps. 95:10). The fact of the matter is that the laws of the Torah do not disagree with what is right.<sup>52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Krinsky. That is, all the laws of the Torah must make sense.</i> They are correct in only one thing, viz., that every precept, be it minor or major, must be weighed in the scale of one’s heart wherein the Eternal has planted some of his wisdom. Thus if there appears something in the Torah that is intellectually impossible to accept or contrary to the evidence of our senses, then we must search for a hidden meaning. This is so because intelligence is the basis of the Torah.<sup>53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cherez.</i> The Torah was not given to ignoramuses. Man’s intelligence is the angel which mediates between him and his God. Thus anything in the Torah which does not contradict reason we must explain literally, take as it is written, and believe that it is so. We should not grope walls as the blind do, and interpret verses according to our subjective needs. Why should we turn what is evident into mysteries? Now if there are places with two meanings both of which are clearly true, one referring to the body and the other to the mind such as “circumcision of the flesh,”<sup>54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gen. 17:11.</i> and “uncircumcised of heart,”<sup>55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 10:16. The point is the reason the flesh is circumcised is so that it will serve as a reminder to the Jew that there is a God above to whom he must submit. Thus the circumcision of the flesh serves as a reminder that one is to circumcise one’s heart. Now although this reason for the commandment of circumcision is (in the opinion of I.E.) self-evident it in no way negates the literal meaning of this law (Cherez). I.E. is vague. For additional interpretations see Weiser and Meijler.</i> and if there is a secret meaning to the <i>tree of life</i>, they are to be taken literally as well.<sup>56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. I.E.’s comments on Gen. 3:24.</i> Now if anyone cannot accept what I have said, if he be wise let him open his eyes. In nature, too, we find things that serve more than one purpose, such as the nostrils, the tongue, and the legs that serve two purposes.<sup>57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hence a verse or a law may have a literal as well as a secret meaning.</i>",
            "The fourth approach is close to the point, and a group of commentators have pursued it. This is the method adopted by the scholars in the land of the Greeks and Romans.<sup>58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Christian world in contradistinction to those living in the Moslem world.</i> They do not rely on grammar but rather on Midrashic exegesis as do the books <i>Lekah Tov</i><sup>59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A “Midrashic commentary to the Pentateuch and the five scrolls composed by R. Tobiah ben Eliezer of Castoria (Bulgaria) in the 11th century.” (<i>Standard Jewish Encyclopedia</i>, N.Y., 1966.)</i> and <i>Or Enayim</i>.<sup>60</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A Midrash composed by R. Meir of Castoria. R. Meir was a student of R. Tobiah ben Eliezer.</i> Since the interpretations quoted in these works are already found in the books of the ancients, why do these later interpreters tire us by writing them again?<sup>61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These books merely quote earlier Midrashic material. Weiser explains that I.E. was upset with these books because they kept people from comprehending the literal meaning of the text and from learning how to analyze the Bible from a grammatical point of view.</i> There are Midrashic interpretations that are, in reality, in keeping with the literal meaning of the text.<sup>62</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Weiser. An alternate interpretation is: there are Midrashim which contradict each other.</i> There are other Midrashim that are not to be taken literally, they have a secret meaning, an example being the Midrash to the effect that the Torah pre-dated the world by two thousand years. This Midrash is true only according to its secret meaning. However, many do not understand it so. Actually, it is impossible to take this Midrashic statement literally because a year is made up of a given number of days, and the measure of the minute and the day is contingent upon the motion of the sphere.<sup>63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Medieval man believed that the earth is surrounded by a sphere, in which the sun, moon, planets and stars are embedded. Without these spheres and their contents there can be no time, for time is made up of minutes, hours, days, weeks, months and years (cf. I.E.’s alternate introduction).</i> Hence if there is no sphere there is no day, certainly not two days or a year or two thousand years. If one were to ask,<sup>64</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This question is implied by anyone who takes literally the statement that the Torah existed two thousand years before the creation of the world.</i> what was the world like before creation, would he not be ashamed of himself for seeking an entity when as yet there was nothing in existence? Those who respond<sup>65</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, they respond to I.E.’s insistence that the Rabbinic statement under discussion cannot be taken literally by saying: it can because there were other worlds in existence prior to this one.</i> by saying that God created other worlds before this one and that he created this world at a propitious time<sup>66</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 3, “Rabbi Judah bar Simon said, ‘Scripture states and there <i>was</i> evening’ (Gen. 1:5), this teaches that there was time before this…Rabbi Abahu said, ‘God created worlds and destroyed them until he created this one…’”</i> are offering an answer based on the <i>plummet of emptiness</i> (Is. 34:11). Similarly those who say that the Almighty brought the world into existence to show his might to man, the object of creation, have satisfied themselves with a miserable answer which takes into consideration only part of a larger problem. There is clear proof to all but the blind that only one-twelfth of the earth is inhabited. Furthermore, the entire earth is an insignificant dot in relation to the sphere over it<sup>67</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reference is to the lunar sphere which surrounds the earth (Cherez, Krinsky). The point is how can one maintain that man is the object of creation when he and the whole earth are insignificant dots in the universe.</i> and even less so to the uppermost sphere. The interpretation of <i>yom yom</i> (daily) (Prov. 8:30) as meaning two thousand years is also wrong from a purely exegetical point of view.<sup>68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Midrash states, “The Torah preceded the existence of the earth by two thousand years, this is what Scripture means by, <i>Then I was by Him, as a nursling; And I was daily</i> (yom yom) <i>all delight, Playing always before Him</i> (Prov. 8:30). Now a day of God consists of one thousand years, as it is written, <i>For a thousand years in Thy sight are but as yesterday</i> (yom etmol) (Ps. 90:4).” Hence <i>yom yom</i> means that the Torah was God’s delight for two thousand years (<i>Bereshit Rabbah</i>, 8:2).</i> If the meaning of <i>yom yom</i> (day) was two thousand years, Scripture would have read: <i>yomayim</i> (two days) rather than <i>yom yom</i> (daily). This is so because the meaning of <i>yom yom</i> is daily. We similarly read, <i>ish ish</i> (what man soever) (Lev. 17:3) and <i>Blessed be the Lord day by day</i> (yom yom) (Ps. 68:20). Furthermore, the end of the verse <i>Playing always before him</i> proves the point.<sup>69</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Playing always</i> means the same as <i>yom yom</i>; hence <i>yom yom</i> means daily not two thousand.</i> Additionally, Proverbs goes on to say, <i>Happy is the man, that hearkeneth to me, Watching daily</i> (yom yom) <i>at my gates</i> (Prov. 8:34). Now, if <i>yom yom</i> means two thousand years then it follows that we should observe the true Torah for two thousand years.<sup>70</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If <i>yom yom</i> means two thousand years then Prov. 8:34 reads: Happy is the man that hearkeneth to me, watching for two thousand years at my gates, i.e., observing the Torah for two thousand years. Since no one lives that long what purpose is there for Scripture to make such a statement? Hence <i>yom yom</i> cannot mean two thousand years.</i> Furthermore, the verse <i>For a thousand years in Thy sight are but as yesterday</i> (Ps. 90:4) speaks of man not of God.<sup>71</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See note 68. I.E. disagrees with the rabbis who interpret <i>Thy sight</i> as God’s sight. According to I.E. <i>Thy sight</i> refers to man’s sight.</i> Those who are interested in the interpretation of this verse will find it in my commentary on Psalms.",

            "One Midrash<sup>78</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.E. offers examples of a word being “dressed” in various garments.</i> interprets the word <i>bereshit</i> to mean that God created the world through the Torah, as it is written, <i>The Lord made me as the beginning</i> (reshit) <i>of His way</i> (Prov. 8:22).<sup>79</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 1:2, <i>God looked into the Torah and created the world</i>.</i> Another Midrash states that the world was created upon the leviathan, as it is written, <i>He is the beginning</i> (reshit) <i>of the ways of God</i> (Job. 40:19). Another Midrash states that the world was created so that God might be feared, as it is written, <i>The fear of the Lord is the beginning</i> (reshit) <i>of wisdom</i> (Ps. 111:10). Another Midrash states that the world was created because of the <i>bikkurim</i> (first fruits), as it is written, <i>The choicest</i> (reshit) <i>first-fruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the Lord thy God</i> (Ex. 23:19).",
            "Another Midrash asks, why does the Torah open with a <i>bet</i>? To teach that God is one. It is only His creation that has two (<i>bet</i>) aspects, i.e., matter and form.<sup>80</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, prior to creation there was only the <i>One</i>; after creation there came into being something with two aspects. The word <i>bet</i> also serve as the number two.</i> Another Midrashic reason given for the Torah opening with a <i>bet</i> is that the <i>bet</i> alludes to the two worlds.<sup>81</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The earth and the eternal world.</i> Another Midrash asks, why does the Torah open with a <i>bet</i> followed by <i>resh, alef, shin</i> and finally by <i>yod tav</i>? It answers that Scripture teaches that the first Temple, which preceded the creation of heaven and earth,<sup>82</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <i>Pesachim</i> 54a.</i> will stand for 410 years and then be destroyed.<sup>83</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The interpretation is as follows: <i>bet</i> stands for <i>bayit</i> (the Temple), <i>resh, alef, shin</i> stands for <i>rishon</i> (first). <i>Tav</i> is numerically equivalent to 400 and <i>yod</i> to 10, hence, the interpretation: the <i>bayit rishon</i> (first Temple) will stand for 410 years.</i> The Bible continues, <i>Now the earth was unformed and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep</i> (v. 2). This means that darkness descended upon the earth following the removal of the Divine presence from the earth.<sup>84</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When the Temple was destroyed.</i> However, all was not lost, for <i>(and) the spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters</i> (v. 2); i.e., the spirit of wisdom and understanding rested on the expounders of the Torah which is likened to water.<sup>85</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Tikune Zohar</i> 30 reads, “What does, and the spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters, mean? Without a doubt it means that when the <i>Shikhinah</i> went into exile God’s spirit hovered over those who study the Torah.”</i> Ultimately God will say, <i>Let there be light</i> (v. 3); i.e., the Messianic age will come. At that time God will separate those who hope for the Lord’s salvation and those who do evil deeds in the dark.<sup>86</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the meaning of <i>And God divided the light from the darkness</i>, etc. (v. 4).</i>",
            "Another Midrash interprets <i>bereshit</i> to be two words that mean that everything was created out of fire which is the foundation of all.<sup>87</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Midrash apparently rearranges the word <i>bereshit</i> as <i>berit esh</i>, a covenant of fire. Cf. Weiser and Cherez. See also <i>Tikune Zohar</i> 22, which similarly interprets <i>bereshit</i>.</i> Another Midrash states that <i>bereshit</i> alludes to six, as in <i>six</i> (shit) <i>cubits</i> (Dan. 3:1).<sup>88</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Midrash breaks up <i>bereshit</i> as follows: <i>bara</i> (he created) <i>shit</i> (six).</i> The six allude to the six compass points of every body. The numerical value of first letters of each word in the first verse of the Torah comes to 22. This alludes to the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Similarly the seven letters in this verse allude to the seven vowels or to the seven planets.<sup>89</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, the seven moving stars. They are: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury and the Moon.</i> The first verse of the Torah has 28 letters corresponding to the 28 phases of the moon.

            "The fifth method is the one upon which I will base my commentary. It appears to me to be correct in the presence of God whom alone I fear. I will not show favoritism to anyone when it comes to interpreting the Torah.<sup>94</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.E. will take issue with accepted authorities when he feels they misinterpret the Biblical texts.</i> I will, to the utmost of my ability, try to understand grammatically every word and then do my best to explain it. Every word whose meaning the reader desires to know will be found explained the first time the word is encountered. For example, the meaning of sky (<i>shamayim</i>) will be given in the first verse of Genesis. This will apply to all terms. I will not make mention of the reasons offered by the Massorites<sup>95</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“The commentators who sought to explain the cause of the deviations from normal orthography.” (M. Friedlander, <i>Ibn Ezra Literature</i>, Vol. III, London, 1877).</i> as to why certain words are at times spelled full and at other times defectively because all of their reasons are of a Midrashic nature. The fact is that Scripture sometimes fully and clearly spells out a word and at other times omits an unpronounced letter for the sake of brevity. Since the Massorites claim to be able to explain the reasons for full and defective spellings, let them tell us what spelling the scribes should have used in writing Scripture.<sup>96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This interpretation is based on the reading in <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38.</i> Now Moses left out the <i>vav</i> of <i>yimlokh</i> (shall reign) in <i>The Lord shall reign</i> (yimlokh) (Ex. 15:18), whereas the editors of Proverbs spelled the word <i>yimlokh</i> with a <i>vav</i> in <i>For a servant when he reigned</i> (yimlokh) (Prov. 30:22). However, many years passed between Moses and the editors of Proverbs.<sup>97</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The point being that one cannot expect consistency over such a long period.</i> Actually, the reason given by the Massorites for the different spellings of the same word are for children. I would also add that one who correctly interprets the Torah does not need to assume any scribal emendations.<sup>98</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See I.E.’s comments on Gen. 18:13.</i> It should also be noted that the Aramaic translation of the Torah accurately rendered the meaning of the Pentateuch and explained to us all its difficult parts. Now if at times he (the Aramaic translator, Onkelos) followed the Midrashim,<sup>99</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The point is that Onkelos occasionally offers a Midrashic interpretation of a verse whose meaning is obvious. He does so to offer additional meanings to the text. In these instances no harm is done since the plain meaning is obvious.</i> although he knew the basics better than we, he did so in order to offer additional meanings to a given text where even the simple could grasp the plain meaning of the text.<sup>100</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In such cases there is no chance of even a simpleton misunderstanding the literal meaning of a verse which Onkelos interprets Midrashically.</i> Thus he renders <i>iroh</i> (Gen. 49:11) not as foal but as his city, and <i>beni</i> (colt) as will build. He also renders <i>atono</i> (his ass’s colt) (<i>Ibid.</i>) as “the gate of the entrance” (<i>sha’ar ha-iton</i>).<sup>101</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. Ezek. 40:15. Onkelos renders <i>Binding his foal</i> (iroh) <i>unto the vine, And his ass’s colt</i> (beni atono) <i>unto the choice vine</i> as, Israel (the vine) will go round about His city (Jerusalem). Israel (the choice vine) will build (<i>beni</i>) His Temple (<i>atono</i>, connecting <i>atono</i> with <i>sha’ar ha-iton</i> in Ezek. 40:15).</i> No harm was done by this because the literal meaning of a verse is never negated by Midrashic interpretations for there are 70 faces to the Torah. However, with regard to verses which deal with laws, statutes and regulations, if we find two possible interpretations for a verse and one of them is in keeping with the interpretation of the transmitters of tradition,<sup>102</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rabbinic sages.</i> all of whom were righteous men, then without reservation and with all our might we will rely on the truth of their words.<sup>103</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The point is, when the Rabbinic interpretation is in keeping with the meaning of the verse it must be accepted even if it is possible to interpret the verse differently. As to those instances where the Rabbinic interpretation contradicts the plain meaning of a verse, see I.E.’s comments on Gen. 1:26 and the notes thereto.</i> Heaven forbid that we should join the Sadducees who claim that the traditions of the Rabbinic sages contradict the literal meaning of Scripture and the rules of grammar. The fact of the matter is that our ancient sages are true and all their words are true. May the Lord God of truth lead his servant in the way of truth."

According to Weiser it is there for emphasis. Our verse should thus be rendered: First God created heaven and earth.</i> They compare it to the <i>bet</i> in the word <i>ba-rishonah</i> (at the first) (Genesis 13:4). We know the <i>bet</i> in <i>ba-rishonah</i> to be superfluous for we find <i>they shall set forth first</i> (rishonah) (Numbers 2:9).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to this opinion <i>rishonah</i> and <i>ba-rishonah</i> mean the same. Hence the <i>bet</i> of <i>ba-rishonah</i> is superfluous.</i> However, if this were so the <i>bet</i> (of <i>bereshit</i>) would be vocalized with a long <i>kamatz</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As is the <i>bet</i> of <i>ba-rishonah</i>. The fact that the <i>bet</i> of <i>bereshit</i> is vocalized with a <i>sheva</i> proves that both cases are not exactly the same.</i> Other scholars maintain that the word <i>bereshit</i> is always in the construct and its meaning in our verse is: “In the beginning of the evening, or of the night, or of the darkness.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word or phrase that <i>bereshit</i> is connected to is missing and must be supplied by the reader. According to Cherez, I.E. is trying to explain why the superfluous <i>bet</i> of <i>bereshit</i> is vocalized with a <i>sheva</i> while that of <i>ba-rishonah</i> is vocalized with a <i>kamatz</i>. The reason is that <i>bereshit</i> is in the construct and therefore is vocalized with a <i>sheva</i>.</i> However, they have overlooked <i>And he chose a first part</i> (reshit) <i>for himself</i> (Deuteronomy 33:21).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Where the word <i>reshit</i> is in the absolute.</i> Others say that the <i>bet</i> of <i>bereshit</i> is a preposition.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew texts printed in our editions are most probably incorrect. We have followed <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38, which has <i>kli ta’am</i> rather than <i>bli ta’am</i>.

                    "CREATED. Most Biblical commentators explain that the word <i>bara</i> (created) indicates creation <i>ex nihilo</i>. <i>But if the Lord make</i> (yivra) <i>a new thing</i> (beri’ah) (Num. 16:30) is similar. However, they have overlooked <i>And God created</i> (va-yivra) <i>the great sea monsters</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">God obviously did not create the sea monsters <i>ex nihilo</i>, for the verse concludes, <i>and every living creature that creepeth, wherewith the waters swarmed</i>, which shows that the sea monsters were created out of the water. Also, it is absurd to assume that on the fifth day of creation God would create sea monsters <i>ex nihilo</i>.</i> (Gen. 1:21) and the three times the word created is used in one verse, viz., <i>And God created</i> (va-yivra) <i>man in His own image, in the image of God created</i> (bara) <i>He him; male and female created</i> (bara) <i>He them</i> (Gen. 1:27). They also failed to consider <i>I form the light, and create darkness</i> (Is. 45:7) wherein darkness, which is the opposite of light, an existing entity, is described by the prophet as being created.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Darkness is the absence of light. Thus Isaiah uses the term created in the opposite sense of creation <i>ex nihilo</i>. In Isaiah it means the creation of nothing out of something (Krinsky). Hence <i>bara</i> does not necessarily imply creation <i>ex nihilo</i>.</i> The following is the precise explanation of the word <i>bara</i>. <i>Bara</i> has two meanings, one of which has been noted above.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, to create or make.</i> The second<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, to eat.</i> is found in the verse <i>neither did he eat</i> (bara) <i>bread with them</i> (II Samuel 12:17). However, in the latter case, an <i>alef</i> has been substituted for a <i>heh</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Most of our manuscripts of the Bible have <i>barah</i> with a <i>heh</i>. However, Ibn Ezra’s manuscript must have had <i>bara</i> with an <i>alef</i>. See also Jacob ben Haim’s edition of the Hebrew Bible, 1524, which has the same reading as Ibn Ezra. There is some difficulty in understanding this comment as the printed text is corrupt. We have followed <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 as suggested by Weiser. For a different rendering see Filwarg.</i> The reason is that <i>bara</i> (in I Sam. 12:17) is similar to <i>le-havrot</i> (to urge to eat) in <i>And all the people came to cause David to eat</i> (le-havrot) <i>bread</i> (II Sam. 3:35). The verb <i>le-havrot</i> appears in the <i>hifil</i> (and its root ends with <i>heh</i>), for if it ended with an <i>alef</i>, Scripture would have read <i>le-havri</i>, as in <i>to make yourselves fat</i> (le-havri’achem) <i>with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel</i> (I Sam. 2:29). We also find <i>bara</i> conjugated in the <i>pi’el</i>, as in <i>and cut down</i> (u-vereta) <i>for thyself (trees)</i> (Joshua 17:15). This is not like the similar word <i>beru</i> in <i>choose</i> (beru) <i>you a man for you</i> (I Sam. 17:8) but rather like <i>bare</i> (hack, dispatch) in <i>and dispatch them</i> (u-vare) <i>with their swords</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ibn Janah, <i>The Book of Roots</i>, root <i>bet, resh, alef</i>, explains <i>bara</i> in Josh. 17:15 to mean chose, as in I Sam. 17:8. Ibn Ezra disagrees. The point of I.E’s comment is that <i>bara</i> spelled <i>bet, resh, alef</i> primarily means to cut. It is encountered with this meaning in both the <i>kal</i> and <i>pi’el</i>. <i>Bara</i> also means to eat. However, in the latter case its root is <i>bet, resh, heh</i>, although it is found spelled <i>bet, resh, alef</i> in I Sam. 17:8. In the latter instance, however, we treat it as if there were an interchange between the <i>heh</i> and <i>alef</i>.</i> (Ezekiel 23:47). The meaning of <i>bara</i> is to cut or to set a boundary. The intelligent person will understand what I am alluding to.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I. Husik, <i>A History of Medieval Jewish Philosophy</i>, p. 190, notes, “The Hebrew word <i>bara</i>, ordinarily translated “created,” which implies to most people the idea of <i>creatio ex nihilo</i>, Ibn Ezra renders, in accordance with its etymology, to limit, to define, by drawing or incising a line or boundary. Having said this, Ibn Ezra, in his wonted mysterious manner, stops short, refusing to say more, and preferring to mystify the reader by adding the tantalizing phrase, ‘The intelligent will understand.’ He means apparently to indicate that an eternal matter was endowed with form.” Nahman Krochmal, <i>More Nevuche Ha-zeman</i> (quoted by Krinsky), suggests that Ibn Ezra’s belief is similar to that of the Kabbalists; i.e., the world was created out of an emanation from God. See also C. Sirot, <i>Philosophy in the Middle Ages</i> (Hebrew), p. 112. Ibn Ezra was a neo-Platonist. According to neo-Platonism the world came about by emanation from God. Ibn Ezra is apparently saying that at the creation spoken of in the first chapter of Genesis, God gave final form to what had previously emanated from Him.</i>",

Every language has honorific terminology. In the non-Hebrew tongues when an inferior addresses a superior he employs the plural. In Arabic it is customary for a dignitary such as a king to speak in the plural. In Hebrew, too, it is considered a sign of dignity to employ the plural when speaking of a superior. Such is the case with the words <i>adonim</i> (lords) and <i>be’alim</i> (owners). Thus Scripture says, <i>a cruel lord</i> (adonim) (Is. 19:4),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Adonim</i> is a plural, yet its meaning in this verse is singular (lord).

Similarly man’s highest soul is called heart (<i>lev</i>) even though the soul itself is incorporeal while the heart is corporeal.

Similarly God is called <i>Elohim</i> because He acts via the angels. Husik, p. 191, points out that according to I.E., “God cannot come in contact with the material and changeable (hence)…it follows that (the terrestrial world)…was not made directly by him, but by angels; hence the word <i>Elohim</i> is used in the first chapter of Genesis, which means primarily the angels, and secondarily God as acting through the angels.”</i> I will explain part of the secret of God’s name when I comment on <i>for My name is in him</i> (Ex. 23:21). Pay no heed to the opinion of Rabbi Saadiah Gaon who holds that man is superior to the angels. I have already explained to you in <i>The Book of Foundation</i> that all of his proofs are wrong. We know that the prophets are the most exalted human beings. Nevertheless, the prophet Joshua fell upon his face and prostrated himself before God’s angel and said to him, <i>What saith my lord unto his servant</i> (Josh. 5:14).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua’s bowing before God’s angels proves that angels are superior to prophets.</i> The same is true of the prophets Zechariah and Daniel.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Both address the angels as superiors. See Zechariah 1:9 and Dan. 10:17.</i> Why should I elaborate when this point is so elementary?The meaning of Lord of Hosts (<i>Elohe ha-tzeva’ot</i>) is the same as <i>God of gods</i> (<i>Elohe ha-Elohim</i>) (Deut. 10:17).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We thus see that <i>Elohim</i> means the same as <i>tzeva’ot</i> (hosts or angels).</i> The definition of <i>elohim</i> (lord) is angels.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Reading <i>malakh</i> (angel) rather than <i>melekh</i> (king) (Weiser).</i> People engaged in the dispensation of God’s justice are also called <i>elohim</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to Rabbinic interpretation <i>Elohim</i> at times signifies a judge.

David (in Psalm 104) speaks first of creation. He starts with light and says, <i>Who coverest Thyself with light as with a garment</i> (Ps. 104:2). He then goes on to say, <i>Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain</i>, heaven referring to the firmament upon which is water, fire, snow and wind. David next says that the wind serves as God’s agent; i.e., it goes wherever God sends it. He speaks in a similar vein of fire as one of God’s ministers.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalm 104. It is not to be taken as implying that the angels are made out of fire. It rather means that fire is God’s agent. Cf.

However, according to Saadiah the creation of these two elements is implied. There was no need for Scripture to mention their creation as their creation is self evident.

I.E.’s alternate commentary on this verse in Weiser, p. 145.</i> Others say that the earth includes water and the heaven air.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hence Scripture does state that these two elements were created.</i> However, in my opinion the heaven and earth spoken of in our verse refer only to the firmament and the dry land.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gen. 1:1 does not tell us that God created heaven and earth on the first day; neither does it deal with the creation of matter. I.E. will explain the meaning of this verse later on in his comments.</i> For only one thing was created on each day. Thus light was created on the first day, the firmament on the second, plants on the third, luminaries on the fourth, and living creatures on the fifth and the sixth. This interpretation is borne out by the psalm quoted above (Psalm 104). It is impossible to maintain that the line circling the dot was created before the dot, or the dot before the circle. Hence our sages say that heaven and earth were created simultaneously.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Hagigah</i> 12a.</i> They offer as proof of their viewpoint, <i>Yea, My hand hath laid the foundation of the earth, And My right hand hath spread out the heavens; When I call unto them, They stand up together</i> (Is. 48:13).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>They stand up together</i> implies that they were created simultaneously.</i> However, this proof is questionable.

The explanation of this verse is as follows: I, God, created heaven and earth. When I call them, they stand before Me as servants ready to do My will. The meaning of this verse is similar to that of <i>Thy word standeth fast in heaven</i> (Ps. 119:89). After stating this the Psalmist makes mention of the earth (Ps. 119:90).

See note 99.</i> because the firmament did not come into being until the land dried.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">97</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus land was created on the second day and not on the third day.</i> Proof of this is Scripture’s statement, <i>In the day that the Lord God made earth (dry land) and heaven (the firmament)</i> (Gen. 2:4). Thus they were made on the same day. The revelation of something which had previously been hidden (the land) or the gathering of something which was scattered (the water) into one place is not a creation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">98</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hence Scripture (Gen. 2:4) states, <i>the Lord God made earth and heaven</i>, rather than the Lord God created earth and heaven. I.E. had previously commented that only one thing was created on each day. He therefore explains that the making of the firmament and dry land on one day does not constitute the creation of two things on the same day, for the drying of the land was not a creation.</i> The meaning of our verse is: now God had said, <i>Let the waters under the heaven be gathered</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">99</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>And God said</i> is to be understood as a pluperfect. Verses 8 and 9 are to be read as one verse and understood as follows: And God called the firmament heaven…for God had said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place (Cohen).</i> There are hundreds of similar instances in the Torah. I will offer two examples from the portion of <i>Bereshit</i>. One is: <i>And the Lord God planted a garden eastward, in Eden; and there He put the man whom He had formed</i> (Gen. 2:8). After stating this, Scripture goes on to say, <i>And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight</i> (v. 9). However, God caused vegetation and trees to sprout before the creation of man.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">100</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to Gen. 1:11,12, vegetation was created before man. Therefore the meaning of Gen. 2:9 is: And out of the ground the Lord God had previously made to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight.</i> The second example is when God commanded man not to eat from the tree of knowledge (Gen. 2:16). However, immediately after this it is written, <i>And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto the man</i>, etc. (Gen. 2:19).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">101</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The implication is that the beasts of the field were created after man. However, Gen. 1:25 tells us that man was created after the beasts of the field. Hence the meaning of <i>formed</i> in Gen. 2:19 is had formed, i.e., before creating man God had formed the beasts of the field and every fowl of the air.</i> The meaning of <i>formed</i> thus is had formed. According to this interpretation it follows that <i>And God saw that it was good</i> (Gen. 1:10) is connected to the act of creation which took place on the second day.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">102</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The account describing the making of the sky and the earth concludes with Gen. 1:10, <i>And God saw that is was good</i>.</i> The account of the creation which took place on the third day thus begins with <i>And God said: Let the earth put forth grass</i> (Gen. 1:11).",

Note that all the works of creation came into being by God’s command for the sake of man. Scripture relates that the earth and water brought forth plants and all living creatures.

Levine (p. 135) suggests that I.E. speaks of man’s dual nature; i.e., he has a body and a soul.</i> man is thus one but also two. <i>In the image of God</i> means in the image of the angels. Man was created both male and female.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">164</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The angels are of only one sex, man is of two.

The verse merely serves as a peg on which to attach an authentic tradition.</i>"

Afterward, the honored and revered name (the Tetragrammaton) is coupled with it.

The will is not perfectly pure. Although man’s well being is contingent upon his making the correct choices, volition (<i>chefetz</i>, desire) frequently acts contrary to the intellect, due to the paradox of various faculties within man struggling for control. Volition (desire) is animated by the intellectual faculty but it is opposed by lust which originates from the appetitive and sensitive dimensions (Gen. 3:24).” Man’s goal in life is thus to seek “knowledge of God” and to subdue “all interfering passions” (p. 14).</i> It alludes to the following: Intellect (the Garden of Eden)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">76</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Man’s intellect is his Garden of Eden (Kaputa).</i> gave birth to desire (the tree of knowledge).

The meaning of <i>shenatayim yamim</i> (two full years) (Gen. 41:1) is two complete years from day to day.

In keeping with the concept of I.E., but more important out of respect to God, we have translated <i>shoded</i> as overpowering.</i> meaning, He is victorious and overpowering. The reason God used this name at this time was to impress upon Abraham the fear of God so that he would circumcise himself.

Furthermore, on a more “practical” level it is via the Tetragrammaton that the world was created, and via the name <i>Shaddai</i> that nature is overcome. Others comment that the Tetragrammaton stands for creation and <i>Shaddai</i>, for destroying or limiting the creation (Krinsky).

Krinsky sees in it an allusion to the Christian doctrine of trinity. According to him, <i>a few say</i> refers to the Christians. Filwarg disagrees. He insists that I.E. is merely saying that God’s revelation took the form of three angels appearing to Abraham. One can argue on behalf of Krinsky that the Christians did use this verse as “proof” of their doctrine of trinity. And indeed, I.E.’s language seems to support Krinsky. On the other hand, would I.E. refer to the Christians as <i>a few say</i>, thereby giving some credence to their trinitarian interpretation?

Let me explain, then, that these are more ignorant (than the opinions concerning God’s essence previously refuted) because they did not wait until they reached the end of the passage. For had they had patience until they heard the verse: <i>And the men turned from thence, and went toward Sodom; but Abraham stood yet before the Lord</i> (Gen. 18:22), they would have realized that the <i>men</i> had departed while the light of God remained stationary with Abraham, who was in its presence. The thought therefore that God was identical with these men is completely refuted” (<i>The Book of Beliefs and Opinions</i>, Rosenblat translation, p. 108).

In reality God did the wonders and they were attributed to Moses and Aaron because they were the agents by which the miracles were performed. Now according to this interpretation, <i>and they did eat</i> (v. 8) is to be taken literally. Similarly, according to this interpretation, the term <i>Adonai</i> (Lord) in <i>My lord</i>, (Adonai) <i>if now I have found favor in thy sight</i> (v. 3) does not refer to the Deity, but means my lords.

According to this interpretation the Bible introduces the chapter with a statement that God appeared to Abraham. It then tells us that before God appeared to Abraham angels visited him. Scipture then records what God told Abraham when He appeared to him (v. 17-21). According to the earlier interpretation God first appeared to Abraham and then Abraham saw the angels.</i> According to this interpretation, <i>And he lifted up</i> (v. 2) is to be interpreted: and he had already lifted up his eyes and looked and done so and so. After this, God appeared to him and said, <i>Shall I hide from Abraham that which I am doing</i>, etc. (v. 17), and <i>Verily the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great</i>, etc. (v. 20). <i>But Abraham stood yet before the Lord</i> (v. 22) when the two angels who left for Sodom arrived there.

However, all opinions agree that <i>And the Lord said: Verily the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and verily their sin is exceedingly grievous</i>, etc. (v. 20 and 21), definitely records God’s words to Abraham. Upon hearing this, Abraham drew near and said, <i>Wilt thou indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked</i>, etc. (v. 23-32).<i>And the men turned from thence, and went toward Sodom; but Abraham stood yet before the Lord</i>, (v. 22) is a parenthetical statement noting that at the very moment that the men came to Sodom, God told Abraham, <i>Verily, the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great</i>. This is similar: <i>As they were going down at the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul: ‘Bid the servant pass on before us - and he passed on - but stand thou still at this time, that I may cause thee to hear the word of God’</i> (I Sam. 9:27).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>And he passed on</i> is a parenthetical statement.

                    "THAT GOD DID PROVE ABRAHAM. Some say that the word <i>nissah</i> (did prove, tested) is a variation of <i>nissa</i> (lifted up),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The problem which some commentators found in a literal translation of <i>nissah</i> as prove is that it seemed to imply that God did not know what Abraham’s response to his request would be. They thus interpreted <i>nissa</i> as coming from <i>nun, sin, alef</i>, meaning lifted up; i.e., God exalted Abraham by showing him to be a paragon of absolute obedience to the Lord’s will. Cf. <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 80:55.</i> with the <i>sin</i> replacing the <i>samekh</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Nissah</i> is spelled <i>nun, samekh, heh</i> ; <i>nassah</i> is spelled <i>nun, sin, alef</i>.</i> and the <i>heh</i> replacing the <i>alef</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>heh</i> in <i>nissah</i>, like the <i>alef</i> in <i>nasa</i>, is silent.</i> However, the plain meaning of the entire chapter contradicts this interpretation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The chapter deals with a test, a trial. Hence <i>nissah</i> means proved, tested, not exalted.</i> The word <i>nissah</i> is thus to be taken literally. The philosophers teach that there are two kinds of knowledge, knowledge of events prior to their occurrence, and knowledge of what is presently in existence. The latter is the meaning of <i>God did prove,</i> and <i>for now I know</i> (v. 12).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">God knew (now I know) what Abraham would do if tested. However, until Abraham offered Isaac, God’s knowledge was knowledge of the potential or possible. He tested Abraham (did prove) to actualize His knowledge (Krinsky). He now knew what Abraham did, not only what Abraham would do.</i> Saadiah Gaon says that <i>did prove</i> means that God tested Abraham in order to demonstrate his piety to mankind; furthermore, he interprets <i>for now I know that thou art a God-fearing man</i> (v. 12) to mean that now I have made known to all that thou art a God-fearing man. But didn’t Saadiah know that even Abraham’s young men were not present when he bound Isaac and placed him on the altar?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. verse 5. In other words, no one was there to witness his act.</i> Others say that <i>and offer him there for a burnt offering</i> is to be interpreted as: bring him up to the mountain; this will be considered as if you brought him up as a burnt offering.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word translated as offer him { <i>ve-ha’alehu</i>) literally means bring him up.</i> However, Abraham did not understand his prophetic vision<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He thought that God actually wanted him to offer his son as a burnt offering.</i> and hurried to sacrifice Isaac. God then told him, “I did not ask you to slay Isaac.”Still others say that God told Abraham: act as if you were bringing him up as a burnt offering. We find a similar occurrence in connection with the prophet Jeremiah, who was commanded to <i>Go unto the house of the Rechabites…and give them wine to drink</i> (Jer. 35:2).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rechabites were foresworn by Rechab from drinking wine (Jer., Chap. 35). When God told Jeremiah, <i>and give them wine to drink</i> he did not intend that Jeremiah actually make them drink. Similarly God’s intention was not that Abraham actually sacrifice Isaac. He wanted Abraham to make all the preparations necessary for the sacrifice, i.e., to bind Isaac, lay him on the altar, etc. He was to do everything as if he were offering him as a sacrifice.</i> Now these geonim offered the above interpretations because they held that it is not possible that God would issue a command and then take it back.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">God is unchangeable; hence his mind, too, is unchangeable. Therefore they offered the latter two interpretations.</i> However, they overlooked the fact that God took the firstborn to serve Him and after a year replaced them with the Levites.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The first-born were at first sanctified to God to minister before him (Ex. 13:2). However, the next year the Levites took their place. Cf. Num. 3:40-44.</i> In reality all questions are removed by Scripture’s first stating <i>that God did prove Abraham</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">God did not change His mind. He never intended for Abraham to sacrifice Isaac.</i> The reason God tested Abraham was in order to reward him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For his willingness to sacrifice his son in obedience to His will. I.E. now backsteps and explains why God, who is all-knowing, tested Abraham. He had earlier insisted that “prove” is to be taken literally. He now explains why. He similarly alludes to the meaning of <i>for now I know</i>.</i> ",

In this instance <i>ne’echaz</i> is a participle, meaning it is caught.

How did the servant know this? I.E. suggests that the servant believed that God had accepted Abraham’s prayer (Krinsky). Or I.E.’s point is that the servant did not set up a test to see if the Lord set aside a damsel for Isaac. He trusted that God had because he relied on Abraham’s prayer (Filwarg). Throughout this section I.E. refers to the servant as “the servant.” He apparently was uncertain as to whether to identify him with Eliezer, as the Midrash and other medieval commentators did.</i> He was certain that God accepted it and sent an angel, the latter being God’s very own messenger, to help him by appointing a damsel in a dream.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.E.’s comment is vague. Weiser suggests that an angel appeared to Rebekah and directed (appointed) her to go out to the well. According to Krinsky the angel appeared to Rebekah’s family in a dream and told them to appoint a damsel for Isaac.</i> The servant reasoned that there was no family as charitable as his master’s.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hence a girl saying, <i>Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also</i> would most probably be of Abraham’s family (Krinsky).</i> Many are perplexed <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Taanit</i> 4a.</i> because they say that the servant expressed his request improperly.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words they claim that the servant selected an improper omen as proof of God’s choice. “What would the servant have done if a lame or a blind girl would have offered to give him and his flocks water? What would he have done if she was not of Abraham’s family and kindred” (<i>Taanit</i> 4a)?</i> I, however, do not see anything wrong in what he said, for had it been another damsel, one not of Abraham’s family, who offered to give him drink and water his camels, he would have left her and nothing would have been lost, for the verse <i>and said; Whose daughter art thou</i> means he had previously said, before he gave the ring and bracelets to Rebekah, <i>whose daughter art thou</i> ?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verses 22 and 23 state that the servant first gave Rebekah a golden ring and two bracelets and then said, <i>Whose daughter art thou</i> ? This implies that he took Rebekah for Isaac before he knew who she was. This contradicts what I.E. has just said, hence his interpretation.</i> Scripture similarly states, <i>And I asked her, and said: Whose daughter art thou? And she said: The daughter of Bethuel…And I put the ring upon her nose, and the bracelets upon her hands</i> (v. 47). The sum of the matter is the servant prayed that God would appoint for Isaac a young lady from the family of his master, the sign of God’s choice being that the damsel would act graciously as a woman of noble character should.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. Cant. 7:2 (<i>bat nadiv</i>).</i> God heard his prayer. However, the case of Jonathan is totally different.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.E.’s point is that the servant did not really set up a test to determine God’s will. He merely offered a prayer that God send him what he was looking for. His choice was not dependent on what the girl would do. If she acted in a certain way then he would investigate further. However, Jonathan set up a test. If such and such would happen he would act thus; if it did not, he would act differently. Jonathan’s test related to his attacking the Philistines. Jonathan said, <i>If they say thus unto us: Tarry until we come unto you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them. But if they say thus: Come up unto us; then we will go up; for the Lord hath delivered them unto our hand; and this shall be the sign unto us</i> (I Sam. 14:9, 10).</i>"

The point is that Jacob had acquired eleven sons and Dinah by the time he had finished serving his 14 years for his wives (v. 25). The first seven years he had no wife (v. 20).

The reason I.E. says that Jacob’s sons were born six months and some days following conception is to allow for the days of “uncleanliness” following childbirth during which Jacob abstained from intercourse with those wives who conceived twice in one year (cf. <i>Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer</i>, Chap. 36).

One, the prophet says, <i>Israel shall be without king, and without prince</i> because God chose only members of the Davidic family to be kings over Israel. Therefore the verse which follows says, <i>afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the Lord their God, and David their king</i> (v. 5). The verse continues, <i>and without sacrifice, and without pillar</i>; this refers to sacrifices and pillars to the idols. In a similar manner, <i>and without ephod</i> also refers to idolatry, because the worshippers of Baal made an imitation of the ephod that Moses made.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The two interpretations of Hos. 3:4 are: A. The verse deals with idol worship, hence the juxtaposition of ephod and teraphim. B. The verse deals both with the worship of God and with idolatry.

I will explain the ephod and offer irrefutable proofs for my interpretation concerning it in the proper place if God will be kind to me and grant me life.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. I.E.’s “long commentary” on Ex. 28:6.</i> The second interpretation is that <i>and without ephod or teraphim</i> means, they will neither serve God (<i>without ephod</i>) nor idols (<i>or teraphim</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to this interpretation the ephod mentioned in Hos. 3:4 refers to the one used in the worship of the Lord.</i> That teraphim are idols can be ascertained by Laban’s referring to them as gods (v. 30).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We thus see that the teraphim were used in idol worship although they were not originally made for that purpose. This validates I.E.’s interpretation that the teraphim refer to idol worship. In Hosea I.E. explains this second interpretation as follows: <i>and without sacrifice</i> to God, <i>and without pillar</i> to Baal, <i>and without ephod</i> to God <i>or teraphim</i> to Baal.</i> Some say that Rachel stole the teraphim in order to keep her father from idolatry.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf.

Hence when Jacob said, <i>And Thou saidest: I will surely do thee good</i>, he was restating, <i>and I will be with thee</i>.</i> Jacob was afraid because of the possibility that he alone would escape. Furthermore, we know that the personality of the individual is taken into account when his sins are considered, be they major or minor transgressions. Therefore, a minor sin committed by a great personality is considered a major transgression. Jacob was afraid that he may have sinned or inadvertently transgressed in his mind and as a result of this God no longer would be with him.

Reuben, his eldest, was a little over 12. Simeon and Levi, the next two in order, a bit younger. Dinah, who was born in the 14th year of Jacob’s service to Laban, had to be under seven. The question thus arises, could what is described in Chapter 34 apply to such a little girl? Dinah is described as a young lady of age. Furthermore, could children of Simeon and Levi’s age, preadolescents, overcome and slay a city? Could pre-adolescents act and talk the way Jacob’s sons are described as doing in Chapter 34? I.E. thus suggests that many years passed between the end of Chapter 33 and Chapter 34. During these years Jacob’s children had grown.

Why, then, did Scripture insert this chapter (Chap. 38) at this point when logic dictates that <i>And Joseph was brought down to Egypt</i> (Gen. 39:1) should follow <i>And the Midianites sold him (Joseph) into Egypt</i> (Gen. 37:36)?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, Chap. 39 should follow Chap. 37.</i> The Bible placed this chapter (38) here to contrast the behavior of Joseph vis-a-vis his master’s wife with that of Judah toward his daughter-in-law.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joseph controlled his passions. When Potiphar’s wife said to him, <i>Lie with me</i> (Gen. 39:7) he refused. On the other hand when Judah saw the harlot in the entrance to Enaim he said to her, <i>Come, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee</i> (Gen. 38:16).</i> What forced me to offer this interpretation is the fact that only twenty-two years passed between the sale of Joseph and the descent of our ancestors into Egypt.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joseph was 17 when sold. He was 30 when appointed vizier over Egypt. Jacob came to Egypt after seven years of plenty and two of hunger passed. Thus a total of 22 years passed from the sale of Joseph to Jacob’s descent into Egypt (Cherez). It is impossible for the events described in Chap. 38 to have occurred in such a short time.</i> Now we learn in this chapter of the birth of Onan, Judah’s second son,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The point is that not only does Scripture tell of the birth of Er, the eldest son of Judah, it also tells of the birth of and marriage of his second son, Onan, as well. Er was at least close to a year older than Onan. Thus at least 13 years had to pass between the sale of Joseph and the marriage of Onan and Tamar.</i> and his reaching the age of procreation, which at the very earliest starts at the age of 12. Scripture goes on to state, <i>And in the process of time</i> (v. 12).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew literally reads, <i>and the days became many</i>. That is, following Onan’s death Tamar, his widow, dwelt in her father’s house for a long time.</i> The chapter then tells us that Tamar conceived and gave birth to Perez. This same Perez came to Egypt with two sons of his own (Gen. 46:12).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We thus have to allow at least 13 years for the birth and marriage of Onan. We have to allow for the years that Tamar spent in her father’s house. We have to allow 12 years for Perez’s coming of age and two each for the birth of his sons. All of this could not have happened in 22 years, even assuming the above minimum figures.</i> Do not be disturbed by the question of Bezalel,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to the Talmud the early generations produced children at the age of eight. If this is the case then it is possible for all of the above to have taken place in 22 years: namely, Er was married in the ninth year after Joseph’s sale. A year later Onan married. Tamar then stayed for many days in her father’s house. We can interpret many days to mean a year. Eight years later Perez gave birth to a son and a year later to a second one. Thus it is possible for all that is reported in Chap. 38 to have taken place between the sale of Joseph and the descent into Egypt.<br>The Talmud concludes from the account of Bezalel that the early generations had children at the age of eight We read in <i>Sanhedrin</i> 69b: “Whence do we know that the first generations produced children at eight years? This is to be inferred from the following: <i>Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah</i> (Ex. 35:30), and it is written:..<i>And Caleb (the son of Hezron) took unto him Ephrath, who bore him Hur. And Hur begot Uri, and Uri begot Bezalel</i> (I Chron. 2:19, 20). When Bezalel was engaged in building the Tabernacle he was at least 13 years old as it is written, <i>came every man from his work which they wrought</i> (Ex. 36:4) and one is not called a man before the age of 13. And there is a Baraitha which states: The first year Moses prepared all that was necessary for the Tabernacle, and in the second year he erected it and sent the spies. And it is written: <i>And Caleb the son of Jephunneh said…Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh-barnea</i> (Josh. 14:6, 7) Now deduct 14, the age of Bezalel, from the age of Caleb when he was sent as a spy and there remains 26. Deduct two years for the three pregnancies with Uri and Hur and Bezalel, and there remains 24. Hence each of them produced children at the age of 8.” It should be noted that the above is based on identifying Caleb ben Hezron (I Chron. 2:18-20) as Caleb ben Jephunneh (Josh. 14:6, 7). However, according to I.E. these two Calebs were not the same. Hence, the entire Talmudic passage quoted above is Aggadic and not in keeping with the plain meaning of the text.</i> for I will explain it when I come to it."

Moses was 80 at the time of the Exodus (Ex. 7:7); thus Moses was born 130 years after the descent into Egypt.

There it is stated that the prophet Ahijah, who prophesied during the reign of King Jeroboam, saw Amram the father of Moses. Ahijah thus lived close to 600 years. This is therefore a greater miracle than that of Jochebed, and yet Scripture doesn’t mention it. Hence this Midrash can serve as support for the liturgical poets that Scripture omits certain miracles (Cherez). Krinsky explains that the liturgical poets can argue that if Ahijah could live 600 years, why is it hard to believe that Jochebed was still alive at the time of Moses’ death?</i> it is an aggadic statement or an individual opinion.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is therefore not binding and cannot be offered as proof.</i> I believe that the way to solve our problem is by recognizing the fact that the Bible includes Jacob among the seventy who came into Egypt and starts the count of the seventy from him. The verse (15) is to be interpreted as if it read: all the souls of his sons and his daughters plus himself were thirty-three. Proof that this is the way to interpret this verse is that Scripture previously states, <i>And these are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons</i> (v. 8).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We thus see that Jacob is included in the number of those who came to Egypt.</i> Should one argue and say, “Does not Scripture explicitly state, <i>And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls</i> (Ex. 1:5)?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jacob obviously cannot be included in those that came out of his loins.</i> Know that Scripture isn’t concerned with noting that one of the seventy did not come from Jacob’s loins, as it didn’t bother to leave out Benjamin when it said, <i>These are the sons of Jacob, that were born to him in Paddan-aram</i> (Gen. 35:26), even though Benjamin was not born there. We have two proofs in our own Torah portion that this is the style of Scripture. First, the Pentateuch states, <i>And these are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons</i> (v. 8). The Torah thus includes Jacob among the sons of Israel. It does so because Scripture speaks of the majority of those who came to Egypt. Secondly, Scripture states, <i>all the souls of the house of Jacob, that came into Egypt, were three score and ten</i> (Gen. 46:27). However, Manasseh and Ephraim did not come into Egypt, they were there to begin with, having been born in Egypt.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yet Scripture lists them among those who came to Egypt (v. 20).</i> In the same vein another verse<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">So <i>Vat.

This comment presents a problem. I.E. reads, “even one as insignificant as water (<i>afilu pachaz ka-mayim</i>).” This reading is extremely difficult since up to now I.E. explains <i>pachaz ka-mayim</i> as referring to Reuben’s action, not to Reuben’s punishment. Filwarg suggests deleting these words. Krinsky and Cherez emend <i>afilu</i> to <i>attah</i> (you). Weiser suggests that this comment has been misplaced and that its proper place is after Saadiah’s comment. In this case I.E. amplifies Saadiah’s explanation that <i>pachaz</i> means something insignificant. However, it appears that I.E. anticipated Saadiah’s interpretation of <i>pachaz ka-mayim</i>.</i> Accordingly the <i>vav</i> of <i>totar</i> is properly vocalized with a <i>cholam</i>, and it follows the paradigm of <i>tosaf</i> (more) in <i>Think upon the battle, thou wilt do so no more</i> (al tosaf) (Job 40:32).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Totar</i> is a <i>hifil</i> and follows the paradigm of <i>tosaf</i> which is also a <i>hifil</i>. Since <i>tosaf</i> is a <i>hifil</i> the text should have read <i>tosef</i>. But as the word comes at the end of a verse the <i>tzere</i> changes to a <i>pattach</i>. Similarly <i>totar</i> should have been written <i>toter</i> but as it concludes a segment of a poetical line the <i>tzere</i> changes to a <i>pattach</i>. Cf. Rashi on Job 40:32 (Cherez). Thus <i>totar</i> is similar to <i>tosaf</i>.</i> Rabbi Saadiah Gaon explains our line as follows: you will not have any advantage over your brothers even one as insignificant as water. According to Saadiah <i>pachaz</i> (unstable) comes from the same root as <i>pochazim</i> (light, insignificant) in <i>vain and light</i> (pochazim) <i>fellows</i> (Judges 9:4), and the root of the word <i>pachaz</i> does not have to be inverted. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As it must be if we interpret the word to mean unstable. <i>Pachaz</i> (unstable) comes from the root <i>chet, peh, zayin (chafaz</i>) which means to hurry. However, the root of <i>pachaz</i> is obviously <i>peh, chet, zayin</i>. By interpreting <i>pachaz</i> to mean unstable we are saying that we must invert the root <i>chet, peh, zayin</i> into <i>peh, chet, zayin</i>. However, according to Saadiah <i>pachaz</i> has its own root, <i>peh, chet, zayin</i>, and means light, insignificant.</i>",

I.E. reads “my couch went up” as if written, my couch went up from me. He interprets it to mean, my couch was taken away from me. According to I.E., in Chapter 7 of his <i>Yesod Mora</i>, Jacob ceased cohabiting with his wives after Reuben defiled his couch. His reason was: Rachel was dead, Bilhah defiled, and he was angry at Leah because of what her son did and therefore slept neither with her nor her handmaiden Zilpah. “My couch went up” thus means, my conjugal bed ceased to function. Filwarg suggests that the reference may be only to Bilhah.</i> <i>Yetzu’i alah</i> (he went up to my couch) is to be interpreted as if written <i>yetzu’i alah me’alai</i> (my conjugal couch went up from me). Furthermore, the word <i>alah</i> (went up) at times has the meaning of cut off,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In this case <i>yetzu’i alah</i> means my couch was cut off or destroyed.</i> as in <i>O my God, take me not away</i> (al ta’aleni) <i>in the midst of my days</i> (Ps. 102:25). Our chapter is clearly explained in Chronicles where we read, <i>Reuben (was) the first-born of Israel…but, forasmuch as he defiled his father’s couch, his birthright was given unto the sons of Joseph the son of Israel, and he was not to be reckoned in the genealogy as first-born</i> (I Chron. 5:1).

Indeed, were it not for the <i>terror of God</i> that <i>was upon the cities that were round about them</i> (Gen. 35:5), they would have surrounded Jacob and his family and exterminated them all. He (Rabbi Aaron) similarly explained<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, in a positive manner, not that Jacob castigated his sons but praised them for slaying the inhabitants of Shechem and destroying its wall. Rabbi Aaron interprets verses 6-7 as follows: Let my soul not set from their council, from their assembly let my glory not be excluded; For in their anger they slew men, and in their self-will they uprooted a cursed wall; For their anger was fierce, and their wrath it was cruel. Rabbi Aaron interprets verse 8 as follows: I will give them a good portion in Jacob (<i>achallekem be-ya’akov</i>) and may they multiply in Israel (<i>va-afitzem bi’yisra’el</i>) (Filwarg).</i> <i>Cursed be their anger</i> (v. 7) as meaning <i>and in their self will they uprooted a cursed wall</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Aaron renders <i>ikkeru shor</i> (they houghed oxen) as they uprooted a wall.</i> <i>for their anger was fierce</i>.

He notes that we find the two often used synonymously in the book of Psalms. Rabbi Moses’ interpretation is correct since our text repeats itself in different words,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The point is that the second half of the line repeats what the first half said but in different words.

We thus find, <i>Ask thy father, and he will declare unto thee, Thine elders, and they will tell thee</i> (Deut. 32:7), and (in Num. 23:8) <i>How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? And how shall I execrate, whom the Lord hath not execrated</i>?
