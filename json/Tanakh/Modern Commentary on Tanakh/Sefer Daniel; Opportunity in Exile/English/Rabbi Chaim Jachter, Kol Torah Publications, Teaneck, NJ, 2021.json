        "Introduction": [
            "<b><i>Transforming the Covid-19 Pandemic into a Win</i></b><br>The moment in March 2020 the Rabbinical Council of Bergen County announced the lockdown of all Batei Knesset and schools in our area, I resolved to turn the dire and unprecedented situation into a gain. Although fear permeated the air, death announcements were frightfully frequent, and strict isolation was debilitating, the Jewish way is to follow Nachum Ish Gam Zo’s credo “Gam Zo LeTovah”, meaning that there must be some good we can extract from even the most dire situations.",
            "In the spirit of Shimshon’s phrase “MeiAz Yatza Matok”, meaning “from the strong emerges something sweet” (Shofetim 14:14), we devoted deep attention to Sefer Daniel during the isolation of May-June 2020 and the most unconventional learning situation of April-June 2021. Despite the many handicaps, our TABC Talmidim rose to the occasion and delved deeply into Sefer Daniel.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nechemia Perek 2 serves as a dramatic example of transforming a very bad situation into an incredibly positive phenomenon. </i>",
            "It is in this spirit that we present the fruits of our learning in these most challenging of circumstances. Some of the emotions and feelings of those times have been preserved in these pages composed during this trying period. For this reason, we occasionally cite students’ comments verbatim. We feel that sharing these emotions is most appropriate for the solemn lessons set forth in Sefer Daniel.",
            "Unfortunately, Sefer Daniel is not traditionally part of the Yeshiva high school curriculum. It is not even part of more advanced Yeshiva learning. I discovered that this is a very big mistake. The lessons set forth in Sefer Daniel are fundamental to Jewish thought and Jewish life, especially in our times. By ignoring Sefer Daniel, we risk not inspiring ourselves and the upcoming generations.",
            "Our hope is that our work will demonstrate the excitement and drama of Sefer Daniel which make it a compelling learning experience for Yeshiva High School and advanced students. We hope our book begins to bring about the time when no one misses the unforgettable opportunity to learn Sefer Daniel with its most foundational lessons that express the core of Jewish life and outlook."
        ],
        "Dedication": [
            "It is a special honor to dedicate this Sefer in memory of Avi Gilad zt”l. My learning and teaching of Sefer Daniel began with a conversation with Avi during a parent-teacher conference at Torah Academy of Bergen County in November 2000. Avi suggested that I learn Sefer Daniel with the boys, noting that Sefer Daniel is most interesting and compelling. I took his recommendation to heart, and it proved to be excellent advice. Students indeed have very much enjoyed learning Sefer Daniel. Our Sefer reflects the keen interest that students continue to experience as a result of Avi’s initiative. “Opportunity in Exile” is the magnificent end-product of Mr. Gilad’s encouragement and willingness to think out-of-the-box.",
            "The Hebrew title for this book, “Av L’Dugma,” captures Avi’s personality. Avi continues to serve as a “Dugma”, an example par excellence, of how a Jew should live. He was a highly involved and dedicated husband, father, grandfather, son, brother, and uncle. He never missed a Minyan and diligently learned the Daf Yomi. He was a very honest and very successful businessman who was well liked and respected in the communities in which he lived.",
            "I vividly recall my last visit with Avi in a Manhattan hospital. As I was leaving, his eldest grandchild entered the room. The love between grandfather and granddaughter was very evident. Both of their faces lit up with delight as they saw each other. There was no generation gap between them. They had clearly connected on a most profound level. Avi magnificently connected with everyone in his family and communities in a most meaningful manner.",
            "I believe Avi is looking from Gan Eden immensely pleased with our dedicating “Opportunity in Exile” in his memory. A special thank you is due to Avi’s wife and children - Ruth, Rebecca, Erez, Leah, Yosef, David, and Yoni - for facilitating the publication of this work. May Avi’s Neshama experience an Aliya in the merit of the wonderful Torah learning experiences which he generated and continues to generate."

                "<b><i>Introduction to Sefer Daniel</i></b><br>It is very exciting to begin a deep dive into Sefer Daniel! In brief, Sefer Daniel begins a few years before Churban Bayit Rishon and ends approximately seventy years later, at the start of the building of Bayit Sheini. I believe that the theme of Sefer Daniel is that Torah life continues despite the exile and that in the end Jews who remain loyal to Torah emerge as triumphant. As we progress in the Sefer, we will further develop this assessment.",
                "We will be guided by (and often disagree with) the very interesting and somewhat out-of-the-box work on Sefer Daniel called “Daniel: Galut V’Hitgalut” (exile and revelation) written by the colorful Yeshivat Har Etzion Rosh Yeshiva Rav Yaakov Medan (the Sefer is archived at Har Etzion’s Virtual Beit Midrash).",
                "<b><i>Introduction to the Beginning of Sefer Daniel</i></b><br>In order to appreciate the opening two Pesukim of Sefer Daniel, it is vitally important to grasp the chain of events leading up to Churban Bayit Rishon.",

                "2. 609 BCE – 598 BCE: the eleven-year reign of disappointing Yehoyakim ben Yoshiyahu Melech Yehuda. Yehoyakim was installed as king by the Egyptians.",
                "3. 605 BCE – Nevuchadnetzar succeeds his father as Babylonian Emperor.",
                "4. 604 BCE – Nevuchadnetzar seizes control of Eretz Yisrael.",

                "6. 598 BCE – After three years of Yehoyakim’s rebellion, Nevudchadnetzar lays siege to Yerushalayim and captures Yehoyakim (and installs Yehoyachin, Yehoyakim’s son, as Melech Yehuda).",
                "<b><i>Nevuchadnetzar and Year 3 of Yehoyakim’s Reign - The Problem</i></b><br>Daniel 1:1-2 teaches that Nevudchadnetzar laid siege to Yerushalayim and captured Yehoyakim in the third year of the latter’s reign. This assertion is especially troubling since Yirmiyahu 25:1 states that Nevuchadnetzar began his reign in the fourth year of Yehoyakim’s reign! This is a glaring Setirah/contradiction!!",
                "<b><i>Solutions - Seder Olam/Rashi and the Pashtanim</i></b><br>Rashi to Pasuk 1 solves our problem based on the Seder Olam<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Seder Olam is Chazal’s timeline (as its name implies) from Creation until Alexander the Great’s Conquest of Persia. Seder Olam might be understood/interpreted as a Midrashic timeline.</i>. Seder Olam/Rashi explain that the fourth year of Yehoyakim’s reign in Sefer Daniel 1:1 refers to the third year of Yehoyakim’s rebellion (which is the eleventh year of Yehoyakim’s reign and the eighth year of Nevuchadnetzar’s reign; i.e. 598 BCE).",
                "The Pashtanim, including Ibn Ezra (to Pasuk 1), Abarbanel<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Abarbanel wrote extensively on Sefer Daniel. His commentary on Sefer Daniel is called Maayanei HaYeshua.</i>, and Malbim (to Pasuk 1), offer a different approach. Rav Medan<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">https://www.etzion.org.il/en/sefer-daniel-introduction</i> summarizes their approach: “the siege did, in fact, take place in the fourth (or third) year of Yehoyakim's reign, as stated at the beginning of <i>Sefer Daniel</i>. To resolve the discrepancy between the two accounts, they explain that the two sources use two different dating systems, each with its own start of the year”.",
                "Seder Olam/Rashi seems dramatically more compelling than the Pashatanim. It seems far-fetched, my TABC Talmidim note, to argue that different Sefarim in Tanach maintain different dating systems.",
                "<b><i>Developing Seder Olam/Rashi:</i></b><br>Sefer Melachim’s description of Yehoyakim’s very turbulent eleven-year reign (Melachim II 23:31-37 and 24:1-7) sheds much light on the logic of Rashi’s approach. It teaches that the three years of Yehoyakim’s rebellion (601 BCE to 598 BCE) are in fact the only years he reigned as a sovereign king. During the first eight years he was a vassal king of Egypt (from 609 BCE to 604 BCE) and Bavel (from 604 BCE to 601 BCE) and not a sovereign king.",
                "Thus, the 598 BCE Babylonian siege on Yerushalayim may be described as occurring in the third year of the sovereign reign of Yehoyakim.",
                "<b><i>Conclusion – Why Sefer Daniel Opens with an Obscure Date</i></b><br>No matter how you “slice” it, dating the Bablylonian siege and its subsequent first wave of the exile of the Jews (of which the very young Daniel is part) to the third year of Yehoyakim’s reign is highly unusual. The question is why Sefer Daniel presents this date in such an obscure manner.",
                "One possible answer is that Sefer Daniel begins with the very violent termination of the last spark of Jewish sovereign control over Eretz Yisrael which would cease for many centuries (until Hasmonean rule began in 165 BCE). Sefer Daniel teaches us how we can continue Torah life, meaning how we can retain control over our spiritual lives, even after we lose political control of our lives. While Jews in Sefer Daniel were no longer sovereign over Eretz Yisrael, Sefer Daniel teaches that every Jew must reign sovereign over his Neshama.",
                "Moreover, an obscure date requiring interpretation surely is brilliantly fitting for Sefer Daniel. More than once Sefer Daniel reveals the “Keitz”, the “ETA” of the Melech HaMashi’ach. However, these “Keitz dates” are obscure and require considerable interpretation.",
                "Finally, it is not just the Keitz that requires interpretation, in Sefer Daniel. The many dreams and visions in Sefer Daniel require authoritative interpretation. Interpretation is absolutely an essential element in Sefer Daniel. Thus, the obscure first Pasuk is the perfect opening for Sefer Daniel. The message might be that Jewish life in Galut hinges very much on the ongoing interpretation and application of Hashem’s word by the authoritative interpreters of each generation. This message is communicated by the fact that we cannot even understand the very first Pasuk of Sefer Daniel without authoritative interpretation."

            "Surviving in the Darkness; Daniel's Ten Day Trial": [
                "<b><i>Poignant Questions from TABC Talmid Eitan Nissel</i></b><br>Sefer Daniel (1:9-15) records Daniel asking his Babylonian supervisor permission to restrict his diet to beans. It is most interesting that Daniel requested permission and did not act unilaterally, despite his having resolved to avoid eating Nevuchadnetzar’s food. Daniel asking permission teaches us to avoid unnecessary aggressive confrontations.",
                "Daniel’s supervisor is kind to him, due to Hashem’s intervention. Without the supervisor’s kindness, Daniel would not have remained loyal to Torah. This kindness is reminiscent of Heigai’s sympathy to Esther and Potiphar and the jail warden’s positive connection with Yosef. The lesson is that while adherence to Torah is very difficult in a foreign environment, Hashem influences events to make it possible for those willing to make the requisite effort.",
                "In response to his supervisor’s concern for severe consequences for Daniel’s potential poor appearance, Daniel proposes a ten-day trial to see how he appears after adhering to his very limited diet.",
                "Eitan Nissel, however, cogently asks what would have happened had Daniel’s appearance been subpar. Would Daniel have agreed to partake of Nevuchadnetzar’s food or would he still have refused to eat non-kosher? If the latter option is correct, would it have been Halachically appropriate for Daniel to cause his supervisor to risk his life? Moreover, if Daniel intends to refuse non-kosher food in any event, why does he suggest this ten-day trial period?",
                "<b><i>Suggested Answers</i></b><br>This question has not, to the best of my knowledge, been answered by the classic Mefarshim, so we offer a number of ideas. One suggestion is that Daniel discerned Hashem’s intervention in the kind response from his supervisor and was therefore confident that Hashem would intervene and enable him to observe Kashrut without bringing harm to anyone. Daniel’s ten-day trial is his means of non-abrasively convincing his supervisor that all will be well despite his very limited diet.",
                "Another possibility is that Daniel was not confident of success. However, the ten-day trial would buy him time. In a difficult situation with no apparent solutions, often the best move is to stall for time. The hope is that the passage of time will bring about a solution.",
                "This is reminiscent of a story told of a Chassidic Rebbe being ordered by the local Poritz (Yiddish for Polish or Russian local landowner) to teach his dog to talk. The Poritz threatened to kill all the Jews in the area if the Rebbe did not succeed. The Rebbe asked for ten years to teach the dog, a wish granted by the Poritz. On the walk home, the Shamash (assistant) asked the Rebbe how he expected to teach the dog to talk. The Rebbe answered that in ten years maybe the Poritz will die, or maybe the dog will die, or maybe he will succeed in teaching the dog to talk!",
                "In Daniel’s case the delay paid off, and the problem was solved in a non-confrontational manner.",
                "<b><i>Conclusion – Surviving in the Darkness</i></b><br>Rav Tzadok HaKohein of Lublin (Divrei Soferim 32) notes that Pesach and Purim represent two different paradigms of redemption. The Geulah from Mitzrayim celebrated on Pesach is a complete redemption. Once the Egyptian army was eliminated at the Yam Suf, we were completely liberated from Paroh. We were transformed, as we say at the Seder, “MeiAfeilah LeOrah,” from darkness to light. Purim, on the other hand, represents survival in darkness. It teaches us that we can survive in darkness (i.e. Galut) even when complete redemption is not forthcoming in the near future.",
                "Although we skirted the threat of Haman, at the end of Megillat Esther trouble still looms as the worrisome Achashveirosh remains in power. This is one reason according to the Gemara (Megilah 14a) that we do not recite Hallel on Purim.",
                "Similarly, in this episode Daniel does not completely solve the problem of Kashrut observance in Nevuchadnetzar’s palace. However, with a mix of courage and savvy, Daniel was able to quietly forge a path to Kashrut observance despite being in an alien environment."
            ],
            "Daniel and His Friends Refuse to Eat Nevuchadnetzar's Food": [
                "<b><i>Malbim - Daniel Risks His Life</i></b><br>Malbim (Daniel 1:8) understands Daniel as risking his life by refusing to eat the king’s food. Nevudchadnetzer was, as typical of rulers of his age, ruthless and unrestrained. He would, on a dime, kill anyone who failed to fully comply with his orders and plans, as will become quite evident as we progress in Sefer Daniel.",
                "<b><i> Rambam vs. Tosafot</i></b><br>However, Daniel’s behavior seems to run counter to the rules of Yeihareig V’Al Ya’avor. Rambam (Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah) rules that we are forbidden to offer our lives for Mitzvot other than the three for which the Torah commands us. How do we reconcile Daniel’s behavior with the Rambam?",
                "Tosafot (Avoda Zara 27b s.v. Yachol) disagree with Rambam and permit voluntary Yeihareig V’Al Ya’avor even for Aveirot for which we are not obligated to die, rather than violate them. Daniel’s stance seems to fit perfectly with Tosafot. However, why do Tosafot support their assertion from an incident quoted in the Yerushalmi instead of from Daniel?",
                "<b><i> Malbim</i></b><br>Malbim to Pasuk 8 explains that Daniel is not merely trying to avoid non-Kosher food. Instead, the food is from Avoda Zara offerings (Tikrovet Avoda Zara). Moreover, the Malbim understands that Nevuchadnetzar specifically wants Daniel to eat food that is part of an offering to Avoda Zara.",
                "Malbim makes an “Okimta,” assuming that this is the reason for Daniel risking his life. However, an approach that need not make such a leap might be more compelling.",
                "<b><i>TABC Talmidim’s Alternative to the Malbim – Shimshy Gordon, Shimon Greengart and Ephraim Helfgot</i></b><br>Shimshy, Shimon, and Ephraim suggest that Daniel never placed his life in danger. He was persistent and intelligent but did not directly confront and disobey Nevuchadnetzar. Daniel expected to emerge strong and healthy from eating legumes. He merely had to convince his supervisor to conduct an experiment that would prove Daniel’s presumption.",
                "According to this suggestion, the lesson that emerges from this episode is that a Jew must be willing to remain steadfast in their Torah observance even if it is inconvenient and uncomfortable<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Similar to Daniel, Mr. Jack Scharf zt”l of Riverdale, New York, a highly decorated soldier in the American army in the European theater during World War Two, similarly avoided non-Kosher meat as a front-line combat soldier; the only meat he ate was the Kosher salamis that his mother sent him from home, which were occasionally delivered to him. Mr. Scharf did not risk his life by shunning the meat served by the American army. However, it was quite uncomfortable for him to do so. Mr. Scharf recounts the very negative impact of non-Kosher food on the Jewish soldiers who did not have the fortitude to refrain from non-Kosher meat. He recalled that they were wont to flippantly remark, “Uncle Sam taught me how to eat ham,” which unfortunately means, “I became highly assimilated while serving in the American army.” It is no wonder that, on the one hand, Mr. Scharf went on to raise observant Jewish families after the war, while, on the other hand, the experience of the hundreds of thousands of Jews who served in the American army during World War Two contributed mightily to the tragic assimilation of a large percentage of the American Jewish community. I perceive Daniel and Mr. Scharf sitting together in Gan Eden smiling when their heroic behavior continues to inspire generations of Jews young and old.</i>.",
                "However, we might argue that even a tiny sliver of non-compliance with Nevuchadnetzar and his underlings is fraught with danger. Daniel’s attempt to seek accommodation for his Jewish practice while in the Emperor’s palace involved high risk.",
                "<b><i> An Alternative to the Malbim – Rav Yaakov Medan</i></b><br>Rav Yaakov Medan argues that an examination of Daniel Perek 1 Pesukim 3-7 reveals Nevuchadnetzar’s goals. Nevuchadnetzar sought handsome, charismatic, and highly intelligent young Jewish boys. One might understand that the Babylonian emperor sought wise Jewish leaders who would help him manage his empire, as Yosef did for Paroh and Mordechai did for Achashveirosh.",
                "However, we suggest that Nevuchadnetzar had far grander goals. He was not merely looking to develop talented advisors for his empire. If that were his goal, there would be no need to demand that the boys be handsome and descendants of the royal line. There would have been no need for him to change their names and have them eat the royal food.",
                "Instead, he sought to bring these boys to his home at an impressionable age to dramatically change their cultural identities. Nevuchadneztar did not attempt to acculturate the Jewish boys but rather to transform them from Jews to Babylonians. Nevuchadneztar figured that young boys would not be able to withstand the pressure to partake of the most exquisite food in the Babylonian empire and that they would quickly succumb to the efforts to assimilate them.",
                "The plan would not end there. Nevuchadnetzar chose handsome and blemish-free young men because they would be able to become leaders of the Jewish people subsequently. Their royal lineage would serve to enhance their credibility as leaders of the Jews. Nevuchadneztar was hoping that these assimilated young Jews would be accepted as leaders of the Jewish people and serve as role models for assimilation into Babylonian society.",
                "Nevuchadneztar hoped they would convince the Jews, now under Babylonian political control, to adopt Babylonian culture and lifestyle. He thought that the young leaders would be especially successful in reaching out to the younger generation to convince them to abandon the ways of their parents. Once the Jews assimilated, they would serve as loyal servants to Nevuchadneztar and his descendants.",
                "<b><i>Daniel’s Resistance</i></b><br>Daniel, despite his youth, grasped the plan and its far-reaching consequences. The future of the Jewish people was at stake, for if the young leaders of the Jews set a poor example to their brethren and young counterparts, the Jews would assimilate and cease being Jews. Daniel and his friends acted correctly, for the future of our people was at grave risk.",
                "Preserving Jewish identity might be why Mordechai refused to bow to Haman, an issue which has puzzled many of the commentaries to the Megillah<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See our essay which summarizes the major opinions, archived at <i>https://www.koltorah.org/halachah/why-did-mordechai-refuse-to-bow-down-to-haman-by-rabbi-chaim-jachter.</i></i>. Mordechai recognized that the Jewish people in the Persian Empire were assimilating (Megillah 12a famously records that we enjoyed Achashveirosh’s extreme parties). If Mordechai, a great leader of his people, were to acculturate and bow to Haman, then the Jews would soon assimilate into Persian society and cease identifying as Jews. Although refusing to bow to Haman placed our people at high risk, bowing to Haman would have been a nail in the coffin of our people.",
                "Eating serves as a powerful bonding experience, as is evident from Bereishit 26:26-30 and 31:43-46. Shemot 34:15-16 and Bemidbar 24:1-3 describe a shared meal with idolaters as a prelude to our worshipping Avoda Zara<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yoma 39a records how non-kosher food makes one unreceptive to spirituality, Timtum HaLev.</i>.",
                "<b><i> Avoda Zara 36a</i></b><br> Avodah Zarah 36a states that Daniel made the Gezeira forbidding us to eat even kosher wine and oil prepared by a non-Jew. According to this Gemara, it is also possible that Nevuchadnetzar prepared kosher food for Daniel, and he nevertheless refused it.",
                "Daniel’s refusal to eat Nevuchadnetzar’s food was critical for the future of our People. Right at the start of the Jewish presence in Bavel, Daniel declared that we would remain Jewish even under Babylonian dominion. Daniel set an example of the sacrifice we must be willing to make to resist the prevailing culture and retain our Jewish identity<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Nimukei Yosef (Sanhedrin 18a in the pages of the Rif) asserts that “a prominently pious individual who fears Hashem and recognizes the generation’s spiritual decline may sacrifice his life even if not technically required by Halacha, in order to inspire the nation to fear Hashem”. Although a young lad, Daniel sensed the great communal need and responsibility thrust upon him and he risked his life despite his tender young age.</i>.",
                "Interestingly, TABC Talmid Menachem Kravetz suggests that once Daniel established that he would maintain his Jewish identity in Nevuchadnetzar’s palace even at very high cost, Daniel was comfortable serving as an advisor to the Babylonian emperor. He no longer feared that this would cause him to lose his Jewish identity<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Similarly, Yosef’s willingness to refuse Eishet Potiphar’s advances made him comfortable serving as an advisor to Paroh.</i>.",
                "<b><i>Conclusion</i></b><br>Sefer Daniel opens with an allusion to rebellion against Bavel. Daniel, following the example set by Yosef resisting Eishet Potiphar<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yosef resisting Eishet Potiphar may be seen not only as avoiding the heinous Aveira of Gilui Arayot but, in a certain way even more importantly, refusing to assimilate into the mores of Egyptian culture.</i>, rebels against Nevuchadnetzar to retain his Jewish cultural independence.",
                "The major theme of Sefer Daniel is that absent willingness to engage in dramatic Mesirat Nefesh (sacrifices), Jews will assimilate in exile. Daniel would have severely jeopardized the Jewish future had he been unwilling to risk their lives to refrain from eating non-kosher food<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">TABC Talmid Levi Langer expresses the point beautifully: Perhaps Daniel is not responding directly to the attempted Avoda Zara-ization. BUT he is heroically taking his life into his own hands (in two senses), he is controlling his destiny, and he is standing up for his identity: I am a Jew, regardless of where I am, and regardless of the pressures on me, (and I will not submit to the broader theme of Avoda Zara) and I WILL NOT surrender an inch and become the tiniest bit Megu'al (spiritually degraded) by consuming foreign food and wine. Bnei Yisrael are in dire need of this crucial message of resilience, speaking truth to power, and zero tolerance of assimilation.</i>.",
                "The same applies to every generation. Had the Hasmoneans not made extraordinary sacrifices to resist Antiochus’ program of Hellenizing our ancestors, Torah observance might not have survived. Those Jews who did not make extraordinary sacrifices to refrain from Chillul Shabbat during the time (until the 1950s) when the United States ran on a six-day workweek, most often did not have Jewish grandchildren and great-grandchildren.",
                "Each generation has its own unique Nisayon (test or trial). For our generation, our Nisayon is not Shabbat or Kashrut, which are relatively easy to observe in today’s multicultural society. Yeshiva tuition and Aliya are among the great contemporary Nisayonot. If we step up to the challenge and are willing to make extraordinary sacrifices like Daniel, we will join the long chain of Jews who have heroically preserved the Jewish heritage. In doing so, we will be, with God’s help, blessed with Jewish grandchildren and great-grandchildren."

One might respond that Sefer Daniel, which is part of Ketuvim, involves less immediate divine impact than the words of Nevi’im and therefore has a greater risk of inaccuracy.

Yirmiyahu Hanavi addresses an international convention of the region’s kings assembled in Jerusalem to coordinate a rebellion against Nevuchadnetzar. Yirmiyahu urges this distinguished assembly to refrain.",
                "Pasuk 6 of this Perek encapsulates this central message. Yirmiyahu cites Hashem referring to Nevuchadnetzar as “His servant.” Yirmiyahu’s terminology does not reflect Nevuchadnetzar’s piety. He was, tragically, a most impious individual. Instead, it means that this mighty emperor is merely Hashem’s pawn executing His will<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This idea is also expressed by Yeshayahu (10:5)<b>, </b>that the Assyrians are merely Hashem’s tool. Shlomo HaMelech (Mishlei 21:1) expresses the same idea: “The heart of a king is in Hashem’s hand. He tilts it in the direction He desires”.</i>.",
                "TABC Talmidim Ezra Baron, Eitan Leitner, and Elisha Markovitz beautifully explain the relevance of this idea to Nevuchadnetzar’s dream: “The clear message is that Hashem is telling/reminding Nebuchadnezzar that all the greatness he has achieved exists only because of the will of Hashem. We also suggest that Daniel interpreting the dream reminds Nevuchadnetzar that although he is the most powerful king, the Jewish people are above him when it comes to what truly matters: spirituality. Not being able to understand his dream without the help of a Jewish sage and being reminded that Hashem is the true \"King of kings\", Nebuchadnezzar is given a sharp reminder to stay humble”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">TABC Talmid Yehuda Mazin thinks that Nevuchadnetzar was given this dream because in Tanach we never see a king face ruin without first being forewarned. Whether it be Paro being warned about releasing the Jews, the warning we are commanded to make to the Canaanite nations (see Rambam Hilchot Melachim 6:5), the warnings sent by Nevi’im to the kings of Yehuda and Yisrael, Melech Ashur in Yonah, or even non-royal rulers like Eili, all those in power are warned before they face ruin. I believe this is because Hashem gives them the opportunity to change their ways before they are felled. While many neglect their opportunity to reform their behavior and thus suffer, Hashem always presents them with the opportunity. All of these kings achieve success only because of Hashem, and therefore they are responsible to recognize this. Thus, if they turn to idols and ignore Hashem’s command, they are ruined. This is part of the reason that Sefer Daniel and Sefer Yirmiyah explicitly mention that Nevuchadnetzar is successful only because Hashem chose him to succeed.

In the most dramatic moment of the Perek, in Pasuk 47 Nevuchadnetzar, in a rare moment of clarity, recognizes Hashem as the real Authority<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">TABC Talmidim Akiva Prager and Yitzi Weis express beautifully: “Nevuchadnetzar and Paroh experience dreams that have an extraordinary quality which makes them incredibly uneasy. We (human beings) remember our dreams rather often. However, none of us is particularly bothered by these dreams. It seems that Hashem strikes these kings with a sort of plague of dreams that are so strong and disruptive to their daily functioning that it propels them into a state where they are stirring in extreme need for an interpretation. Then, in a state of severe stress (which may demonstrate why he took extreme measures to sentence so many servants to death), he suddenly receives a savior who relieves him from the depths of the plague he is experiencing. After being given this relief, Nevuchadnetzar astonishingly acknowledges Hashem as the true Ruler of the universe. It seems that not only has he been relieved of his stress, but he has gained authentic clarity for perhaps the first time in his life. Nevuchadnetzar’s all-encompassing stress that overcame his mind has now been completely removed and he has reached an entirely new understanding of life. <br> Therefore, we suggest that perhaps, for this moment at least, he is glowing with the realization of God’s existence, and under these circumstances, Daniel is comfortable accepting the offer to serve in a very high position in Nevuchadnetzar’s government”.</i>.",

Nevuchadnetzar and those like him are a passing phenomenon. However, Hashem and His Kingdom last forever. Jews who live their lives in complete conformity with Hashem’s Torah and nobly serve bearers of the divine message have tuned and plugged into eternity, Chayei Olam. Daniel 12:2 introduces the term “Chayei Olam”, noting that Torah loyalists are endowed with Chayei Olam unlike those who pursue temporary success such as Nevuchadnetzar. Therefore, if there is an unavoidable clash between Hashem’s will and Nevudchadneztar’s will, as in Perek 1 and again in Perek 3, Hashem’s Will prevails.",

This Pasuk is highly problematic in light of Melachim II 24:12 which says that Galut Yehoyachin – the first exile of the Jews – occurred in the eighth year of Nevuchadnetzar’s reign. Thus, Daniel was not yet exiled to Bavel in the second year of Nevuchadnetzar’s reign!",
                "Rashi, once again quoting the Midrash known as Seder Olam, solves this problem by explaining that Daniel 2:1 refers to the second year since Nevuchadnetzar destroyed the Beit HaMikdash. Rashi’s explanation fits beautifully with our theme. At a time when Nevuchadnetzar revels in his conquest of the Beit HaMikdash, a feat of which even the mighty Assyrian Emperor Sancheiriv was incapable, he (and we) urgently needs a reminder that he has NOT conquered Hashem<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi presents Nevuchadneztar as entering the Kodesh Kodashim, the innermost sanctum of the Beit HaMikdash, to concretely display his “conquest” of Hashem. Chazal (Gittin 56b) presents the Roman general Titus entering the Kodesh Kodashim acting as an extreme degenerate. Hashem famously responds by sending a gnat to peck on his brain for seven years. Apparently, Nevuchadneztar did not behave as poorly as Titus and Hashem responds more moderately by sending a terrifying dream to humble the Babylonian emperor.</i>.",

TABC Talmid Jacob Becker notes the similarity to the Gemara Niddah 30b that teaches us that we learn all of Torah while in our mother’s womb only to forget when we leave it. Our pre-birth Torah learning enables us, in turn, to identify Torah as authentic when we are reminded of it. In this manner, the Torah is intuitive to us.</i>. On a spiritual level, it is humbling for Nevuchadneztar to depend on Daniel to understand the message of the dream. This is reminiscent of Hashem not conveying the news of the impending Churban Shilo directly to Eili HaKohen, but indirectly through Shmuel, due to the spiritual deficiencies of Eili and his sons. It is also humbling (and perhaps even humiliating) to Eili to depend on Shmu’el to communicate the message.",

This Tefillah contrasts Hashem with the temporal “rulers” of the universe (i.e., the sun, the moon, and the stars). This idea perfectly fits with the theme of the Perek.

The Persian Empire was much less centralized than the Babylonian Empire. Because it was bigger, Persia needed to have provincial governors administer its empire. The smaller Babylonian Empire was ruled much more directly by the king. Compare the role of the governor of Judea in the story of Jesus to the role of the emperor.

Gold signifies that later kingdoms are bigger and stronger; Daniel does not express this to Nevuchadnetzar, because his head enjoys its attachment to his neck. In fact, each later kingdom is represented by stronger materials. Bronze, unlike silver, is used in weapons, while the first people to discover how to smelt iron, easily conquered Egypt.

If we say that the cultural legacies of Christianity and the Roman Empire are what allow us to say it lives on, then we have a pretty significant asymmetry between the first three kingdoms and the last.

David Ben Gurion and his associates did not expect traditional Jewish life to continue. Tragically, as has happened elsewhere throughout the world, many Jews failed to internalize Rav Soloveithcik’s “fourteenth principle of faith” and abandoned Torah life. Only through heroic and unstinting efforts made by great leaders like Rav Ovadia Yosef has Torah life in Israel been preserved. </i>.",

The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to him: I am unique in my world and Abraham is still unique in his world. It is fitting for the unique to save the unique. Therefore, God Himself went down and saved him.

Rav Soloveitchik asks why this is important. The result will be identical since the Malach is a Shali’ach Hashem. He cites the Gemara (Kiddushin 41a) that teaches that it is far superior to marry directly and not via Shali’ach (proxy). The reason, of course, is that although the result is identical, a relationship is established only by the direct involvement of the parties. Hashem directly redeems us from Mitzrayim to forge a connection with us as His beloved nation.",

Hashem directly intervenes to save Avraham Avinu since Hashem wishes to develop a deep relationship with him.

We know that Hashem increased our suffering in Mitzrayim to shorten the time we had to stay there. So too here Hashem made Nevuchadnetzar's suffering great.

In my opinion, all he would be thinking is \"Boy, am I hungry\"- the way animals think. Additionally, when Nevachadnetzar returned, it would be a much easier transition if he stayed human the whole time. Furthermore, if he was transformed into an animal, he would probably be motivated to quickly recognize Hashem during this transition. Staying human makes him ponder his thoughts for a bit and reach a much better and more convincing conclusion submitting to Hashem’s authority. Arriving at a conclusion after long thoughts and pondering can lead one to a much more convincing conclusion than one that is short and not well thought out. This allows Nebuchadnezzer to appreciate Hashem more and be more willing to stay with Him when exposed to potentially contrary evidence. Lastly, let's remember that Hashem prefers to operate B’Derech Hateva. Therefore, I believe that he was forced to live in the wild LIKE a wild beast for seven seasons, not AS a wild beast.",
                "<b>Eitan Mermelstein</b> - I find the Ibn Ezra, Malbim, and Rav Saadia to be very convincing. This is especially so since the Pesukim write that his living place will be amongst the beasts, and he will eat grass like cattle. The movie Tarzan came to mind when reading these Pesukim and may be somewhat in line with what these Mefarshim are saying. I believe Ibn Ezra to be more convincing than the Gaon especially considering the vast transformation that Ibn Ezra describes Nevuchadnetzar undergoing. Moreover, if a year of doing Tzedaka was not enough time for Nevuchadnetzar to change and do Teshuva, it seems improbable that a few months in the forest would do the trick. However, I find Ibn Ezra's proof somewhat troubling because the Pasuk he quotes refers to the term “Idan” which is used in Perek 7 as the amount of time until Moshiach will come, Idan Idanin U'Plag Idan. Given that it has been almost 2,500 years since Sefer Daniel was written and unfortunately Mashiach has not come, the Idan in that Pasuk must be referring to around 1,000 years at least. Therefore, Ibn Ezra's proof from that Pasuk does not appear compelling.",

Moreover, the earliest Dead Sea Scroll that has been found in Qumran comes from the middle of the 3rd Century BCE, centuries later than the time period in which Nevuchadnetzar would have been king. However, Professor Berman's approach is quite sound and logical and may be the correct approach.",

We know that emperors can get rid of all the records and make it seem like nothing ever happens, because it occurred in Shemot. We saw that after Yosef died \"vayakom melech chadash asher lo yada et Yosef.\" There is no way that the king didn't know of Yosef; rather, the records must have been destroyed. If the king destroys the records the citizens are forced to forget it ever happened. That, I believe, is why we don't have external evidence of Nevuchadnetzar's animal episode.",

While both the dream and Daniel's interpretation mention seven time periods, the actual event is described only as occurring after some time. I suggest that seven is used here because of its significance as describing completion, including Hashem. There is a reason for the significance of the seventh day and the seventh year (and, during the Omer, seven weeks). The importance of seven here is that Hashem is completely transforming Nevuchadnetzar's mind into a beastly one. Nevuchadnetzar did not respect Hashem's rulership over the world, represented by Shabbat, so Nevuchadnetzar becomes a beast for a Shavua of time. However, it does not actually have to do with how much time passed.",

Building a city has nothing to do with insanity. Although, the cylinders describing Nevuchadnetzar's accomplishments bring more to light about what it was that he was describing in Pasuk 27. He was literally boasting about having built up Babylon, by physically building more walls and temples. As such, Hashem did not like this self-worship and made him insane.",

                "<b>Elan Goldstein</b> - At first glance of the pesukim I did not think that he literally turned into a wild animal, rather that he lost his sanity. It also makes sense that this story was never recovered because the citizens likely did not want to bad mouth their king. It seems like he was a strict ruler but mostly liked throughout his empire.",
                "<b>RJ</b> – Nevuchadnetzar was pretty vicious and brutal but the Babylonian people may have appreciated the economic benefits and improvement of standards of living he brought by transforming Babylon into the world’s supreme superpower.",
                "<b>Rami Gertler</b> - The reason why it doesn't record Nevuchadnetzar going crazy or even turning into a wild animal is very simple. As Professor Joshua Berman said, who would ever want to record something that the leader of an empire did that was terrible? Who would ever want to remind anyone of something bad that happened to their emperor? Of course it wouldn't record his failures. Hashem happens to be perfect, so we don't have any trouble with that; but Nevuchadnetzar, who was presumably considered the most powerful being in the world at the time, definitely had flaws, but no one would ever dare write that down. But then we come to a problem. Why then, would we ever write down the wrong-doings of our fellow Jews? Doesn't that seem disrespectful? While the answer may not seem obvious, we have to dig a bit deeper. The reason Jews write down these things is to learn from their mistakes. With the Holocaust, for example, we don't know what they did, but we know that it must be a message from Hashem that He wants us to know. So too with regard to every record in Tanach, it is all recorded because Hashem knows that we can learn a lesson from it. Hashem doesn't go out of His way to embarrass someone for doing the wrong thing. He uses them as an example for future generations to improve. This idea goes back to what we learned yesterday. Hashem's goal is not to bully us. His goal is for us to be the greatest that we possibly can be. And the way in which we achieve that is through lessons. Believers in predestination would never record something bad that happened to someone, because they believe that that was decided before that person was born. Jews, however, who believe that they can change and become better people, must learn about what not to do so they can relate more and improve. People are more prone to listen to something if it is a personal story that actually happened. Even though we listen to both Chukim and Mishpatim, there are many for which we don't know the reason. But with stories, we see these mistakes played out as well as their consequences. Therefore, we record the mistakes to learn what not to do in order to become the best Jews that we possibly can be.",
                "<b>David Rabbani</b> - The pesukim seem to corroborate Ibn Ezra's (and many others') approach. Nevuchadnetzar is compared to a wild animal in many ways (like hair, nails) but is never called an animal. This was likely a seemingly natural process because Hashem doesn't like to engage in miracles where it is not necessary to have the desired effect. Nevuchadnetzar knows it is a punishment from Hashem, either way.",
                "Ibn Ezra's opinion seems to make more sense, though I think that possibly the 7 \"seasons\" refers to literal seasons or changes in time, and not a specific amount of time (like 7 days, weeks, months, or years).",
                "I agree that lack of evidence does not mean evidence of absence, particularly from such an ancient kingdom, and because the evidence would be deprecatory to the supreme leader and king of the huge Babylonian Empire.

                "<b>Daniel Gopin</b> - The Ibn Ezra’s reasoning of Nebuchadnezzar not actually turning into an animal is very convincing. We see in pesukim 22, 29, and 30 that it says that he will be fed grass LIKE animals. This would point towards the direction that he didn’t actually turn into an animal. Rather, he was sort of treated like an animal. Also, if I’m not mistaken, we do not ever see in Tanach that a person is literally turned into an animal.",
                "<b>Ezra Baron</b> - I think that Ibn Ezra’s interpretation of Nevuchadnetzar merely acting like a wild animal is not a stretch, but convincing. Also, I find the approach of Professor Joshua Berman, that historical records often fail to mention setbacks, to be both interesting and reasonable. One famous saying is that “history is written by the winners,” and I think that a lack of evidence that Nevuchadnetzar ever vacated his emperorship can be attributed to this idea, as he did not want his failures or mistakes to become etched into history. Furthermore, as you have taught us before, the absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence, and this can certainly be an example of this concept.",
                "<b>Levi Langer</b> - I strongly agree with Ibn Ezra and Malbim and Rav Saadya Gaon that he did not become an animal physically. This is especially true since the Pesukim state that his hair and nails became like those of animals (birds), implying that the rest of his body stayed human.",
                "The advantage to Ibn Ezra is that his hair and nails grow longer in years rather than months. According to the American Academy of Dermatology, head hair grows at a rate of 3.5 inches in 7 months, and 42 inches in 7 years. By that point, continued hair growth would be supernatural, since human head hair grows in a maximum range of 12-42 inches, supporting Ibn Ezra. However, eagles don't grow feathers this long (10-22 in). Maybe we should be less literal, then. On the other hand, it's possible that by the fashion standards of 570 BCE Babylon, a hair length of 3.5 inches longer than normal (and seven months of untrimmed nails) was unheard of (at the very least, for a man), disgusting, unhuman, etc. This is particularly true of a king, who grooms to the highest standards, especially if Nevuchadnetzar took a haircut every day like Jewish kings. This would support Rav Saadia Gaon. Ibn Ezra’s main proof is the difficulty in returning to power after seven years of not ruling. However, there is a Midrash in the beginning of Kohelet that says Shlomo lost power, but it is not clear for how long. In any case, Shlomo is different because the Jews were peaceful, cohesive and loved their king; whereas the brutal Babylonian environment would lead to many coups, murders and fractures, etc.",
                "Obviously, the bricks and cylinders would not record this episode. But if there is substantial non-royal writing extant from Babylon (and I have no idea whether there is), we might expect to see this episode recorded. We also need to consider whether and who would write about him during his absence, and whether and how he would censor and succeed in censoring this information upon his return. Clearly, he does not censor Sefer Daniel. In fact, he seems to publicize the incident, whether he's speaking directly to Daniel to record this episode in his Sefer or a Babylonian scribe to record this, or whether Perek 4 is a speech given to the public or someone else. In fact, he might even record it on the cylinders and bricks, since he has shown how contrite this episode has made him.",
                "With regard to the Da’at Mikra, I don't know enough information. If scholars are certain that Nevuna'id was an emperor, then it seems compelling to identify him with Nevuchadnetzar, but even then I would need to know more information.",
                "<b>Yair Levie</b> - Logically, it makes sense to adopt the Ibn Ezra approach that Nevudchanetzar just acted like a wild animal and did not actually turn into one. One idea that would support this is the concept of ‘Teva’, meaning that if Nevudchanetzar actually turned into a wild animal it would be clear that it was Hashem who did it and intervened; however, if he was just acting like a wild animal it could just be Nevudchanetzar acting crazy and it would decrease Hashem’s visible presence in our world, which increases the Teva behind which Hashem likes to disguise Himself. Regarding no records being found of Nevudchanetzar being crazy, I think it is because everyone else, besides the Jews, looked up to Nevudchanetzar as their fearless leader. However, the Jews saw the truth. Thus, only the Jews recorded the times while Nevudchanetzar was going crazy while everyone else just pretty much worshipped him and stayed loyal to him and did not write anything bad about him. This is supported by Professor Berman’s comments that usually, similar to modern day resumes, old records failed to note any setbacks anyone had, and thus Nevudchanetzar going crazy was not mentioned in any old record books. I think Da'at Mikra’s approach is a stretch and that mine and Professor Berman’s approach makes much more logical sense."

Hashem, like a strict loving father, does not bully us; He empowers us. A strict loving father seeks the best interest of his child. He wants his child to thrive and become great. However, discipline and hard work are most necessary to achieve this greatness and thus the father is strict in his demands. Hashem’s Mitzvot as well as the concept of Sechar VaOnesh are NOT meant to bully us. Instead, they lift us to be all we can be. When the child of a strict loving father accomplishes all he can, both the loving strict father and son rejoice in great happiness and satisfaction.

Consider that Hashem does not seek to remove Nevuchadneztar of his power, but rather to uplift his behavior in light of his being Hashem’s servant. But Hashem also services Nevuchadnetzar in establishing a grand empire.",

The masters of Kabbalah teach that Hashem contracted, limited, and condensed Himself in order for the world to exist (Kabbalah refers to this phenomenon as Tzimtzum). Hashem is infinite and must contract Himself in order for anything but Himself to exist. He must also engage in Tzimtzum in order for human beings to enjoy free will.

Shir HaShirim compares our relationship with Hashem to a relationship between a loving couple. Just as each member of a loving couple must accept limitations in order to create a space for the other member, this reciprocal process of limitations must occur in our relationship with Hashem. Both parties in the relationship must create space for the other member by accepting limitations. Hashem engages in Tzimtzum in order to create a space for us, and we engage in Tzimtzum by following the Torah restrictions in order to create a space for Him in our lives.

                "In other words, Nevu’ah is more about the present than the future<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">94</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A most notable exception to this rule is when Hashem swears that He will do something, using the language such as “Chai Ani”, signifying that this divine utterance is irrevocable.</i>. Thus, the Babylonian empire has the potential to end seventy years after its establishment by Nevuchadnetzar. However, this prophecy materializes only if Nevuchadnetzar’s grandson proves to be unworthy. Accordingly, when the seventieth year emerges it is time to judge Belshatzar. Since he was found to be most unworthy, he is removed and the Babylonian empire comes to an end. Hence, Hashem both counts the years and evaluates Belshatzar.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">95</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Another factor at play is Hashem being “Pokeid Avon Avot Al Banim” (Shemot 20:4), punishing children for the sins of their forebears. Rashi and Onkelos explain that Hashem does so only if the children follow in their ancestors’ footsteps. Belshatzar deserves the punishment accumulated from his father and grandfather, as he certainly follows in their evil footsteps. Rav Medan notes that Belshatzar is worse in that Nevuchadnetzar had a modicum of respect for Hashem by placing the Keilim from the Beit HaMikdash in storage (Daniel 1:2). While he degraded the Keilim by storing them with his gods, at least he did not defile them at a wild party with multitudes of people.</i>",

One explanation is that our Tefillot recorded at the end of Shemot Perek 2 influenced Hashem to reduce the “sentence”. Indeed, Ashkenazic Jews recite on the Yamim Nora’im that “Teshuva, Tefillah, UTzedaka Ma’avirin Et Ro’a HaGezeira”, that our actions can influence the divine decree.",

                "TABC Talmid Eitan Mermelstein questions this assertion, noting that the Tanach does not make this connection in any relevant Sefer - not in Sefer Daniel, Sefer Ezra or Sefer Divrei HaYamim. The beginning of Sefer Ezra and the end of Divrei HaYamim mention that Hashem influenced Koresh's thinking, leading him to permit us to return. Hashem's influence and not fear of Belshatzar's fate seems to underlie Koresh's pro-Zion actions.",
                "While Eitan makes a compelling point, one may respond that there are two factors influencing Koresh. One is Hashem and another is his fear of Belshatzar’s fate<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We must also consider the fact that Koresh/Cyrus permitted other nations to return to their lands from which the Babylonians expelled them and rebuild their temples. This is evident from the famous artifact called “the Cyrus Cylinder” that is housed at the British Museum. Perhaps Cyrus, as was typical of ancient pagans, foolishly believed in multiple gods and he wanted to appease, or at least avoid angering, each of them.</i>. The Tanach is replete with examples of what many refer to as “dual causality”, referring to events influenced by both divine manipulation and humans exercising their free will. The sale of Yosef is a classic example. While the brothers had their motivations, Hashem guided events to execute the Brit Bein HaBetarim (see Rashi to Bereishit 37:14 s.v. Meieimek Chevron). Many understand the Mishna 3:15 “HaKol Tzafui VeReshut Netunah”, all is foreseen yet we retain free will, as expressing this idea<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">97</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Similarly, American President Harry Truman was most likely influenced by Hashem to ignore his cabinet (including his eminent Secretary of State George Marshall) and encourage the establishment of Medinat Yisrael. Yet, he likely also had his own calculations such as courting the Jewish vote in 1948, an election year.</i>.",
                "<b><i>Meriting Ge’ula</i></b><br>Finally, just because the seventy years have expired and the Babylonian empire has ended, does not automatically mean that the Ge’ulah will ensue. Daniel in Perek 9 prays for the return to Yerushalayim and this Tefillah seems to have influenced Hashem to tilt the events in favor of Koresh permitting us to return. After Yirmiyahu HaNavi sets forth the seventy-year terminus of the exile (Yirmiyahu 29:10), he notes (Yirmiyahu 29:12-13) that we will return only if we trigger the redemption with our Tefillot.",

Daniel is well aware that this decree may cause the time for redemption to be missed. He does not view it as an incidental development. He views it in the context of Yirmiyahu's words on prayer, and understands that the decree is a test that God is imposing on His people, on the eve of the redemption, to see whether they love God with all their heart and all their soul and whether they will fulfill Yirmiyahu's prophecy simply and wholeheartedly:</i>",

Darius the Mede seems to genuinely harbor great affection and admiration for Daniel. Later, Koresh permits the Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the Beit HaMikdash. Darius the Persian even finances the completion of the Beit HaMikdash. Much later, kosher food was offered as an option for Jews who attended Achashveirosh’s raucous party (Megillah 12a with Maharsha s.v. La’asot Kirtzon Ish Va’Ish).

                "During the height of the Covid-19 pandemic in May-June 2020, in the midst of a very intense lockdown, I asked the Talmidim what they think Daniel, who risked his life to pray to Hashem, would think of the Rabbinical Council of Bergen County’s (RCBC) momentous decision (endorsed by Rav Schachter and Rav Willig) to close the Batei Knesset in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic?!",
                "Here are their responses:",
                "<b>Eitan Mermelstein</b> - I believe that Daniel would approve of the RCBC's decision because when Tefillah becomes a dangerous public action which could result in death, he does not force other Jews around him to join. He continues davening at home but is not willing to risk the lives of the community.",
                "<b>Ezra Kopstick</b> - I think that Daniel would agree with the RCBC's decision to close down shuls for 2 reasons. One is because we are still davening at home - the RCBC didn’t tell Jews to not daven at all; they just want us to daven at home. This is different than what Daniel was doing because he wasn’t allowed to daven at all. Two, risking your own life is very different than risking the lives of others. If one would go to shul, he would have spread the virus to other people which would hurt other people. Daniel on the other hand was only sacrificing himself for davening.",
                "<b>Elan Agus</b> - I think that he would support the decision to close the Shuls because, even though Tefillah Btzibbur is so important, life is more important.",
                "<b>Menachem Kravetz</b> - I think Daniel would see the closing of shuls under the RCBC as a test for us. Some people only go to shul because they want to hang out. Others are able to concentrate and feel connected to Hashem only in a Minyan. We are currently experiencing a test to show that no matter what happens we will always believe in Hashem and be devoted to Him through davening, talmud Torah, mitzvot, and much more.",
                "<b>Avi Tepler</b> - This is a hard question, considering Daniel persisted in his Tefillah and encouraged Klal Yisrael to do so (albeit B’yechidut). However, I think he would recognize that Klal Yisroel’s mission during Covid-19 isn’t Tefillah B’tzibbur bur rather V’chai Bahem and this is the great Mitzvah to perform right now. And as Daniel davened in the chamber in his house to connect to Hashem and Avraham instituted Shacharit praying alone, we discern from their actions the power of the one on One. Tefillah B’Yechidut enjoys a certain advantage and can strengthen our grasping the importance of Tefillah and our improving focus during Tefillah.",
                "<b>Boaz Kapitanker</b> -Regarding the RCBC’s decision, I think Daniel would support it, as Tefillah isn’t a Yeihareig V’Al Yaavor, but would hope that everyone would daven at home and that shuls would re-open as fast as possible. Indeed, since Tefillah is so essential to us, maybe it should be considered an essential business.",
                "<b>Shimon Greengart</b> - I don't think that a Yeihereig V’Al Yaavor status for Tefillah will affect whether or not we should close down Shuls. After all, even if there were a Yeihereig V’Al Yaavor for Tefillah, it likely would not extend to Tefillah Bitzibor. While there are people who won't daven or won't daven as much outside of Shul, you have no obligation to risk your life or do an Aveira so that they can do a Mitzvah. I don't even think that you would say that it was a time of Shaat Hashmad, because while there were laws against these gatherings, they were based on health concerns and supported by the Jewish communities.",
                "<b>Liev Markovich</b> - The RCBC is showing leadership like Daniel. Daniel led by example, still davening and believing even amid persecution, and so too the RCBC is leading by example by closing Batei Knesset. By not going to shul, you are not only being mosser nefesh for yourself, but also for the rest of your community.",
                "<b>Elan Goldstein</b> - As for Daniel’s thoughts on the RCBC's decision, I do not think that he would be happy about it but he would make the same decision. They would agree that saving numerous lives is the correct choice and more beneficial in the long run. Every life is like a universe.",
                "<b>Noam Barenholtz</b> - The reason people would be opposed to closing shuls is twofold. One, Tefillah BeTzibbur is a value. Two, if there's no shul, people may not daven. Regarding the first problem, Daniel did not daven with a Tzibbur, so I don't see the problem he would have with us not doing it either. Regarding the second, I'm not sure. But there is a Mitzvah De'oraita to preserve life, and the normative Jewish value would be to not have minyanim when people could transfer a deadly disease to one another, so I just have to assume Daniel would follow that normative view.",
                "<b>Rami Gertler</b> - I think Daniel would be very disappointed with those who have been davening with minyan and defying the RCBC. There is a difference between defying the laws of non-Jews to show your devotion and defying the laws and orders of the Jewish community to show your faith in Hashem. Defying non-Jews who seek to harm us shows that we are unwilling to assimilate. Defying the leaders of the Jewish community is a way of saying that you do not agree with them and will not follow their instructions to keep other people safe. Daniel wanted to prove a point. Those who have been davening with a minyan this whole time have shown disrespect to the leaders of the Jewish community. They are putting many people's lives at risk by doing so. It does not show your Emunah in Hashem whatsoever. I don't think Daniel would commend these people.",
                "<b>Yair Levie</b> - Regarding the RCBC decision, I think it is very different from Daniel as one is permitted and encouraged to daven and learn at home. Thus, these situations are incomparable as Daniel was completely forbidden to daven and learn and we have the opportunity to do both as much as we want during this time, so Daniel would not really have a problem with it (he too was just davening and learning alone in his house)."

                "<b><i>The Arba Chayot of Daniel Perek 7</i></b><br>Daniel Perek 7 records a heavenly vision shown to Daniel in which there are four terrifying beasts who are judged by Hashem and their rule is given to a human whose kingdom will last forever. Daniel is baffled by this dream, and he requires a Malach to explain the images. The Malach notes that the four monstrous creatures represent four ferocious Empires who will harm the Jewish people. The Jewish people will eventually overcome, and their kingdom will last forever.",
                "<b><i>Two Major Questions</i></b><br>Two major questions emerge from learning Daniel Perek 7. First, why is the vision of the Arba Malchuyot, already shown to Nevuchadnetzar in Perek 2, repeated in Perek 7? Second, since Daniel knew the interpretation of the dream recorded in Perek 2 about the Arba Malchuyot, why is Daniel baffled by the images of these four dastardly beasts? Should it not be obvious to Daniel that they refer to the Arba Malchuyot which will be succeeded by the Malchut Hashem?",
                "<b><i>Distinguishing between the Arba Malchuyot of Perek 2 and Perek 7</i></b><br>We may answer by noting that Perek 2 is fundamentally a message to Nevuchadnetzar – his reign is not forever. Hashem is the only Eternal King. Of course, we must internalize this message and realize that Hashem the Eternal One is superior to the temporary Nevuchadneztar (or to any other person who wields temporal power over you, such as your boss who is the CEO of a prestigious law firm and is pressuring you to attend a meeting held on Shabbat). Nonetheless the central message of Daniel Perek 2 is that Nevuchadnetzar and his successors are not eternal. No discussion or reference is made to Jewish suffering under these four empires.",
                "Perek 7’s message, however, is directed at us – this is why Daniel receives the message. The message is a terrifying one. The message is one of great suffering that we, the Jewish people, the Kadishin (holy ones), will endure at the hands of horrifying kingdoms appropriately symbolized by noxious beasts. The suffering is quite diverse and extends for a very long time. The suffering seems to last much longer than the seventy years of Galut prophesied by Yirmiyahu – for “Idan, Idanim, UFelag Idan”, a period of time, two eras and a half an era (Pasuk 25). While we do not know exactly how long this is, it is clear that it refers to a very long period of time! The fourth kingdom seems most terrifying of all and its terror is directed towards Hashem and us.",
                "Daniel finds this dream utterly shocking. This dream, which occurred in the waning days of the Babylonian Empire (year one of the three years of Belshatzar’s rule) alerts Daniel to the impending end to Babylonian dominance. However, Daniel (along with all of Am Yisrael) expect all to return to normal at the rapid approach of the end of the seventy years of Galut announced by Yirmiyahu HaNavi. Daniel is utterly shocked to learn that the suffering continues even after the end of Yirmiyahu’s seventy years.",
                "We the Jewish People are reassured, though, that despite this very long period of suffering, ultimately we (and Hashem) prevail and emerge as the eternal people. We last forever since we reflect the eternal word of Hashem. However, only the Kadishin, the Jews plugged into Chayei Olam (Daniel 12:2) who reflect the eternity of Hashem, last forever. The central goal of every Orthodox institution is to facilitate our connection to the eternity of Hashem, His Torah and His People.

The idea of the Arba Malchuyot succeeded by the Malchut Hashem is emphasized in this popular poem. This Piyut echoes the central message of Daniel Perek 7. The suffering under the Arba Malchuyot will be long and difficult. However, Hashem does not abandon us – the Piyut’s phrase “V’Lo Netashtani Kol Yemei Idanai”, refers specifically to the Idanim of Daniel 7:25, the eras whose culmination will be the arrival of the Mashiach and the Malchut Hashem.",

                "Sefer Daniel presents numbers and terms indicating the expected arrival time of Mashiach. The phrase “Idan, Idanim UFelag Idan” of Daniel Perek 7 Pasuk 25 might refer to three and a half “idans” or eras. Daniel 8:14 refers to the number 2,300 without mentioning whether they are days, weeks, months or years. Daniel 12:12 refers to the number 1,335. Many use these numbers as a basis to calculate the Keitz, Mashiach’s estimated time of arrival.",
                "<b><i>One Approach to Calculating the Keitz</i></b><br>The Gemara (Sanhedrin 97b) condemns those who predict the date of Mashaich’s arrival. The Gemara (Megilla 3a) relates that a Bat Kol rang out forbidding the great Tanna Rabi Yonatan ben Uzziel from composing a Targum to Ketuvim lest he reveal the Keitz (which Rashi explains is alluded to in Sefer Daniel). Masechet Derech Eretz (Perek HaYotzei 13) even says that those who try to calculate the Keitz (Mashiach ETA) are denied a share in Olam Haba! The Rambam (Hilchot Melachim 12:2) codifies these rejections of Keitz calculations.",
                "There are serious problems with predicting Mashiach’s arrival date. If one errs, he has needlessly raised the hopes of our people, only to have them crushed when the great expectations are not realized. Moreover, people will not endeavor to improve themselves in order to merit Mashi’ach’s coming because they think it is inevitable. Once an authority interprets the Tanach as prophesying Mashiach’s definite arrival at a certain time, one no longer needs to work to merit his coming.",
                "<b><i>The Ibn Ezra</i></b><br>Of the major classic commentators to Sefer Daniel, Ibn Ezra is one of the few who do not try to calculate the arrival date of the Mashi’ach. Ibn Ezra (to Daniel 8:25) notes that the numbers indicating Mashi’ach’s arrival date are obscure to the point of being incomprehensible to human beings. Ibn Ezra notes that Daniel states (8:27) that he finds these dates incomprehensible. Moreover, he notes that Daniel 12:8 states that these numbers are “inaccessible and sealed”. Only when Mashi’ach arrives will our wise men be able, in retrospect, to decipher the meanings of these numbers<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">114</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This idea brings to mind Shemot 33:23 where Hashem tells Moshe Rabbeinu that he can perceive Hashem only from the back but not from the front.</i>.",

In retrospect, we understand the four hundred years as starting with the birth of Yitzchak Avinu. However, it was pointless for us until the redemption to calculate the date we will be saved.",
                "When Yirmiyahu HaNavi sets forth the seventy years of redemption, in retrospect we understand it both as the seventy years of Babylonian rule (from 609 BCE to 539 BCE) and the seventy years from Nevuchadnetzar’s destruction of the Beit Hamikdash (586 BCE) until its being rebuilt with the support of Daryavesh the Persian in 516 BCE. In the midst of the suffering it is impossible to calculate. Therefore, the Gemara (Megillah 11b-12a) states that Belshatzar, Achashveirosh and even Daniel misunderstood the terminus of the seventy-year sentence.",

The predicted dates arrive and pass without Mashiach coming but the predictions continue unabated.

Rashi and Abarbanel focus on the phrase “Idan, Idanin, UFelag Idan” of Daniel Perek 7 Pasuk 25. This phrase expresses the time we must wait until the final redemption. Rashi understands this phrase to mean one and a half eras after the cessation of bringing the Korban Tamid in the second Beit HaMikdash, which occurred in 64 C.E. (based on Daniel 12:8-13).",
                "Rashi defines an “Idan”/era as 890 years – the time from Yetzi’at Mitzrayim until the first Beit HaMikdash was destroyed. 1.5 eras are 1335 years which when added to 64 C.E. is 1399 C.E. The number 1335 also appears as a Keitz year in Daniel 12:12.",
                "Abarbanel understands “Idan” as referring to 410 years, the number of years Bayit Rishon stood. He believes that “Idan, Idanin, UFelag Idan” refers to 3.5 “Idans” = 1435 years. The starting point is 70 C.E., the year of Churban Bayit Sheini. Result – the Keitz is 1505 C.E.",

                "We suggest that the Mefarshim’s calculations are an expression of Tefilla to Hashem. They echo the beautiful Pasuk (Tehillim 102:14), where we ask Hashem to redeem us since the Moed/Keitz/appointed time of Ge’ulah has arrived. By setting forth the various dates for Mashiach’s ETA, we strengthen our plea that the time for the ultimate redemption has arrived.",

While Belshatzar outrightly disrespected Hashem and died, Daryavesh failed to realize his mission to facilitate our return home to Eretz Yisrael and was punished.

The term “Shavu’im Shiv’im” that appears in Pasuk 24 is understood by Rashi/Chazal as referring to the 70 years from Churban Bayit Rishon to Binyan Bayit Sheini plus the 420 years Chazal say Bayit Sheini stood.",
                "This leads to an astounding point – Bayit Sheini was destined/doomed to fail! Moreover, the Gemara (Nazir 32b) seems to say that the Jews of Bayit Sheini were aware of this interpretation of Daniel 9:23-27!",
                "Malbim (to Pasuk 24 s.v. Shavu’im Shiva) insists that the decree was reversible through Teshuva. Year 420 post Binyan Bayit Sheini is “performance review” time when Hashem will assess whether we deserve the Churban. Thus, destiny and poor choices (Sinat Chinam – Yoma 9b) caused Churban Bayit Sheini – reminiscent of Menei, Menei, Tekal Ufarsin<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">120</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Our performance review time of course is Rosh Hashana, Aseret Yemei Teshuva, Yom Kippur (and Hoshana Rabba according to Kabbalah/Chassidut).</i>.",

If we count the \"shavu'im\" as days rather than years<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">121</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word year is not mentioned in this Pasuk. Thus, there is considerable flexibility in regard to the interpretation of the term “Shavu’im Shivim”.</i>, the angel is confirming for Daniel that the return to Tzion and the beginning of the rebuilding of the Temple will take place during the coming year (490 days are approximately one year and 4 months). The total count arrived at if we add \"shavu'im shiv'im,\" \"shavu'im shiv'a,\" and \"shavu'im shishim u-shenayim\" is almost three years, and this may allude to the three-year reign of Cyrus, who is referred to by Yishayahu (end of chapter 44 and beginning of 45) as \"mashiach.\" The death of Cyrus, the \"mashiach,\" heralded a difficult period for Am Yisrael, as alluded to by Daniel in the final verses of his vision.</i>",
                "<b><i>Adding to Rav Medan</i></b><br>A careful examination of Nazir 32b leads us to conclude that the Gemara does not mean that Churban Bayit Sheini is inevitable. Rather, it is saying that it is possible. The Pasuk presented in regards to the destruction of Bayit Rishon is Yirmiyahu’s (Yirmiyahu Perek 7) rejection of the mindset that “Heichal Hashem, Heichal Hashem, Heichal Hashem Heimah!” - the idea that Hashem will never let His “earthly home” be destroyed. Yirmiyahu HaNavi endeavors to dispel this notion, teaching that the destruction of the Mishkan at Shilo teaches that our sins can lead to the destruction of Hashem’s home! The Beit HaMikdash is not “too big to fail”.",
                "Thus, the interpretation of “Shavu’im Shivim” as predicting the destruction of Bayit Sheini after 420 years, cited by the Gemara in regard to Churban Bayit Sheini, is not a fait accompli. It sets forth the possibility but not inevitability that the Beit HaMikdash will be destroyed.",
                "In other words, the Gemara’s interpretation of “Shavu’im Shivim” is not the only possible interpretation of the term. Had we acted better, the second Beit HaMikdash would not have been destroyed. This would not have been only a result of Teshuva overcoming the negative decree. It could also be that the term “Shavu’im Shivim” would then be interpreted in a manner not predicting Churban, such as Rav Medan’s approach.",
                "These alternate interpretations are similar to Rashi’s explanation of Yonah (Yonah’s 3:4) warning Nineveh that in forty days it will be “Nehepachet”. Rashi notes that the word “Nehepachet” (overturned) may be understood in one of two ways: either it means “destroyed” as the word is used in the context of the destruction of Sedom, or it could mean that it will “turn over”, as in the phrase “turn over a new leaf”, or a complete reversal of behavior as in the phrase \"VeNahaphoch Hu\" from Megillat Esther (9:1).",
                "In other words, by Yonah using the word “Nehepachet”, he communicates to Nineveh that they have the opportunity to create their own destiny. Their destiny is either to be destroyed or change. It is up to Nineveh as to which outcome they wish to occur.",
                "In Sefer Daniel, the flexibility of the term “Shavu’im Shivim” serves the same role as Yirmiyahu’s warning. It warns us that Churban Bayit Sheini is a possible result of our poor behavior<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">122</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Therefore, Rav Yosef in Nazir 32b challenges the Hatarat Nedarim of visitors from Chutz LaAretz who took an oath of Nezirut at the time of the Churban.

Hatarat Nedarim is effective only for something regarding which one would not likely be mindful of at the time he made the Neder.</i>.",

Berachot 4a teaches that our second entry to Eretz Yisrael (during the time of Ezra) was supposed to be as glorious and grand as the first entry (during the time of Yehoshua). However, our lowered spiritual state during Ezra’s time did not allow for this positive promise to be realized. This Gemara seems to indicate that Bayit Sheini held the same promise as Bayit Rishon.",

This Gemara indicates that both Bayit Rishon and Bayit Sheini held equal promise to last forever. Both were destroyed due to spiritual inadequacies but not due to a destined fall.

Ibn Galippe understands all of Sefer Daniel’s visions as not extending beyond the time of Bayit Sheini. The Malchut Hashem that will last forever is the era that the Chashmonaim were supposed to usher in. However, the spiritual fall of the Hasmonean dynasty did not allow this promise to be fulfilled. Daniel’s vision, like all Nevu’ah as stated by Tosafot (Yevamot 50a s.v. Teida), applies only if we are worthy of its realization. Both Rav Yaakov Medan and Da’at Mikra champion this approach as Peshuto Shel Mikra<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">124</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The fact that Perek 11 of Sefer Daniel devotes so much space to the Diadochi (the four kingdoms into which Alexander the Great’s empire was divided of which the Syrian-Greeks severely oppressed us), lends great credence to Ibn Galippe’s view that Sefer Daniel focuses on the struggles and promises of the Chashmona’im.</i>.",
                "It is possible that Ibn Galippe’s approach was the original intent of the Nevu’ah. However, since we proved to be unworthy, the promise was deferred to later generations. The intended message for Sefer Daniel’s original audience was the promise of the Hasmonean kings. However, due to their failures the vision was deferred to later generations.",
                "This deferral reminds us of Malbim’s approach to the Messianic visions set forth by Yishayahu HaNavi. Malbim explains that the visions set forth by Yishayahu in Perakim 2, 7, and 11 refer to Chizkiyahu HaMelech. However, due to his failure to thank Hashem for the great miracle ending the Assyrian siege of Jerusalem (see Sanhedrin 94a), Yishayahu’s vision is deferred to a more worthy candidate in a later generation.",
                "Chazal, subsequent to the downfall of the Hasmoneans, understand that the fourth of the Arba Malchuyot is Rome and that Mashi’ach will arrive when the Roman Empire ends. When that potential redemption failed to materialize, Rashi explains the fourth Malchut to apply to Christian dominance.",
                "In other words, the Mefarshim interpret the Arba Malchuyot in a manner appropriate to their times. In more modern times, when the dominance of the Church has waned, we can interpret the Arba Malchuyot in a manner appropriate to our times. Some now are inclined to embrace Ibn Ezra’s view that Yishma’el represents the fourth kingdom. However one understands the Nevu’ot and visions, their promise will be realized only when we deserve its realization. The promise at each stage of interpretation could have been realized but we did not rise to the occasion and seize each of these opportunities.",
                "In light of our understanding of “Shavu’im Shivim”, there is another approach to Ibn Gallipe’s interpretation. It may be seen as setting forth an option for the original audience. If we prove worthy during the Hasmonean era, the great promises will be realized. However, since other interpretations abound, the promise of the Messianic era will be deferred to a later date in line with the other interpretations, if we are deemed by Hashem as unworthy of the ultimate redemption.",

His family members note (ad. loc.) that Rav Yaakov often repeated this assertion. One gets the impression that Rav Yaakov is making a thinly veiled reference to Medinat Yisrael. If this is correct, then Rav Kamenetzky holds the opposite extreme of those like Rav Yitzchak Herzog who believe that we are guaranteed not to have a “Churban Bayit Shelishi” (i.e. that Medinat Yisrael will inexorably lead to the building of the third Beit HaMikdash which will never be destroyed). We respectfully reject both extremes. We shape and mold our destiny. If we act responsibly, both in a spiritual and practical.sense, we will succeed. If not, we, God forbid, will fall.

The Mishna (Avot 1:2) presents Shimon HaTzadik as among the last surviving members of the Anshei Kenesset HaGedolah and the Rambam in his introduction to his Mishneh Torah understands this to mean the very last surviving member of this very illustrious body. The Gemara (Yoma 69a) describes Shimon HaTzadik encountering Alexander the Great. Thus, the Anshei Kenesset HaGedola did not live during the time of much of the events fairly clearly described in Daniel Perek 11.",
                "Accordingly, it would seem that Sefer Daniel, at least in its entirety, was not revealed to the broader Jewish community even during the time of the Anshei Kenesset HaGedolah. One could, however, counter that the information in Perek 11 is sufficiently veiled that it would be understood only after the events occurred. We, to whom the Chanuka story is well known, easily understand the references. However, it might not have been clear before these events occurred.",
                "<b><i>Conclusion</i></b><br>The contents of much of Sefer Daniel were not revealed to the broader Jewish community until at least the time of the Anshei Kenesset HaGedolah. It may not have been fully revealed until after the events of Chanukah occurred<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">134</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We find as late as the Mishna (Yadayim 3:5 and see Shabbat 13b) that the final determination of what is included in Tanach had not yet been made.</i>."

            "Will Orthodox Judaism Survive?": [
                "A Talmid a few years ago asked me point blank whether I thought Orthodox Judaism will last or will just wither away into the general society – he thought Orthodox Judaism had no chance<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">135</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sadly, the young man seemed to be projecting his own abandonment of Torah life onto the broader Orthodox community. The student also came from a community where, very sadly, there is a very large defection from Torah observance. The observance in too much of that community is shallow and very inconsistent. In such a community there is dim hope for Torah continuity. Sefer Daniel teaches that only the Kadishin, the holy ones, remain forever. Inconsistent observance is most definitely not a path of Kadishin and is hardly a formula for long term Jewish spiritual success. </i>.",
                "I responded that the struggle our generation faces is the same faced by every Jewish generation. In every generation there are Jews who sadly decide they will not run counter to the prevailing cultural winds. The Malach informs Daniel of this sad fact in Perek 11. Tragically, large numbers of Jews abandoned their eternal legacy and succumbed to the temporary glory of the Greek Empire, as foretold by the Malach to Daniel.",
                "However, for more than three thousand years Torah has been maintained by those who muster the courage to stand apart. Our choice is whether to stand in the proud tradition of Avraham Avinu, Daniel, Chanania, Mishael, Azariah, Mordechai, the Chasmonaim upholding Torah, and Rav Ovadia Yosef and Rav Soloveitchik upholding Orthodoxy in the twentieth century.",
                "In the 1950’s there was talk of the vanishing Orthodox Jew. Today Orthodoxy is the only group of Jews growing in numbers.",
                "Sefer Daniel concludes with Techiyat HaMeitim, the revival of the dead. Ibn Ezra (to Daniel 12:2) cites an opinion that sees this revival as also alluding to the revival of the Jewish people returning to their land after a long exile. We add that it also alludes to the revival of Torah observance of many eras including our own. In the 1950’s, the community of Torah learners was tiny. Today it is, Baruch Hashem, burgeoning with exponential growth.",
                "Our choice is whether to take hold of Torah and eternity or succumb to the prevailing winds. Only by fully embracing Torah Hashkafa and observance do we plug into Jewish eternity.",
                "Sefer Daniel inspires us to steadfastly maintain our grip on the eternal Torah despite any and all pressure to abandon it!!! It provides the proven path to Jewish eternity."

                "A cynic once commented that a commentary to Tanach can either be beautiful or faithful to the text but not both. While this statement is not entirely true it does capture the challenge faced by those who deliver Tanach Shiurim. Our listeners, on the one hand, demand our Shiurim represent an authentic approach to the learning. On the other hand, they expect the Shiurim to be beautiful and inspiring and that they emerge with a message that elevates them and enhances their lives as Jews. The constant struggle and challenge faced by Torah educators is the never-ending pursuit of Shiurim that succeed in being both faithful and beautiful.",
                "There is one more ingredient to a successful Shiur. Chazal teach that “Ein Beit Midrash Bli Chiddush”, proper Torah learning includes novel approaches and ideas. In other words, for a Shiur to be successful, the Maggid Shiur must not simply repeat what was said by others. He must inject his own personality and insights into the learning.",
                "The recipe for a successful Shiur is therefore hours of preparation and deep thought. It does not matter how many years one has delivered a Shiur on a particular topic. In order for compelling learning to emerge, enormous effort must be invested. Only with maximum effort and the support of Hashem can success be achieved, in line with the Gemara’s (Megilla 6b) teaching Yagata Umatzata Ta’amin (effort and success go hand in hand).",
                "I have been privileged to teach Sefer Daniel no less than five times at Torah Academy of Bergen County. The students’ relentless questioning, high expectations, and brilliant insights have created a very high bar for which I have invested my all to satisfy. The book we present to our readers “Opportunity in Exile” is the product of the thousands of hours of hard work, deep thinking and intense davening invested to create beautiful and faithful interpretations of Sefer Daniel. I hope it will inspire Jews throughout the world to appreciate the majesty of Sefer Daniel and the treasures that are just waiting to be revealed and discovered. In particular, I hope it will help Rabbanim and Mechanchim in their quest to deliver inspiring and compelling Shiurim on Sefer Daniel to their congregants and Talmidim.",
                "The Gilad and Amar family are critical to the creation of this book. Avi Gilad zt”l was the first to encourage me to think out-of-the-box and to teach Sefer Daniel to high school students. His idea was very on target and has led to great success in the Beit Midrash and classroom. It has even created compelling and very enjoyable learning through the difficulty of isolation during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. Avi’s wife Ruth and children Rebecca, Erez, Leah, Yosef, David, and Yoni have completed the task by enabling us to bring our success in learning to the entire Torah loving world.",
                "James Gershfield, in his dedicated and punctilious style, has elevated my writings on Sefer Daniel into the high-quality work that “Opportunity in Exile” has become. I am grateful for his important contribution.",
                "Many TABC students and alumni are cited in this volume. It is such a pleasure and honor to cite the insights of so many students, especially from the past three years. I thank all of them for partnering in the most noble pursuit in life – to be able to extract the lessons Hashem is expressing in His holy Torah.",
                "I thank Rav Yosef Adler, Rosh Yeshiva of Torah Academy and Rav of Congregation Rinat Yisrael for his constant encouragement over the past twenty-six years at TABC. Torah Academy’s Head of School Rav Shlomo Adelman is due an enormous debt of gratitude for his unending kindness and support.",
                "The breakfast table in the Torah Academy faculty lounge is a treasure of our Yeshiva. I can always rely on a significant discussion amongst the Rebbeim concerning the issues in Sefer Daniel which yields invaluable and enriching insights. I thank my wonderful colleagues for providing such a spiritually nourishing environment.",
                "I thank Hashem for the privilege of serving as the Rav of Congregation Shaarei Orah, the Sephardic Congregation of Teaneck. The formal and informal Torah discussions at Shaarei Orah are among my sweetest memories. May Hashem continue to send us many more years of beautiful Tefillah, Shabbatot and Yamim Tovim together. Special thank you to Heidi and Jack Varon for serving for so many years as the dedicated pillars of this wonderful Kehillah.",
                "I thank Rav Elazar Meyer Teitz, the Av Beit Din of Elizabeth, for adopting me into his family and allowing me to serve as a Dayan with the Beth Din of Elizabeth since 1993. With Rav Teitz’ wise guidance the Beth Din of Elizabeth has flourished and achieved a stellar international reputation for balancing uncompromised fidelity to Halacha and sensitivity to human needs with its work in the fields of Get and Eruv administration.",
                "I thank my wife Malca for providing a loving and happy environment in our house. She is the source of the happiness and joy of our home where our children (and in-law child) Bracha, Yisroel, Binyamin, Chaya Ziporah, Atara and Hillel grow and flourish with Hashem’s help. May our grandson Shmuel David follow in his parents’ Bracha and Yisroel’s wonderful path! My many Shiurim and writings easily flow in abundance due to the joyful environment Malca has created in our home. The accolade Rabi Akiva bestowed upon his family “Sheli VeShelachem Shelah Hi,” “my learning and your learning is all due to her”, applies at least in equal measure to Malca.",
                "May this work serve Le’ilui Nishmat, to elevate the souls of my parents Ben and Shirley Jachter a”h. Although they never had the opportunity to know their daughter-in-law Malca, grandchildren and great grandchild, I am certain that they would have been enormously pleased with their complete dedication to Torah and high-quality character.",
                "May this work serve Le’ilui Nishmat my father-in-law Rav Shmuel Tokayer zt”l and a source of comfort and support to my dedicated mother-in-law Mrs. Chana Tokayer. May Hashem extend her much Bracha and great support and kindness as she extends great support and kindness to all of her children and grandchildren.",
                "Most of all, I thank Hashem for fulfilling my dreams to be blessed with a loving spouse and children, and to spend a life immersed in Kedushah, holy projects. As a young man I dreamed of teaching Torah to teenagers, leading a friendly and warm Kehillah, contributing to Am Yisrael as a Dayan and publishing valued works of Torah. Thank you, Hashem, for transforming all of these aspirations into reality. Thank you, Hashem, for facilitating such a large and loyal readership, way beyond any dreams I harbored. “Mah Ashiv LaHashem Kol Tagmulohi Alai”, I am overwhelmed with the enormous gratitude to which I owe our Creator (Tehillim 116:12). May it be His Will to continue bestowing all these blessings for many decades to come.",
