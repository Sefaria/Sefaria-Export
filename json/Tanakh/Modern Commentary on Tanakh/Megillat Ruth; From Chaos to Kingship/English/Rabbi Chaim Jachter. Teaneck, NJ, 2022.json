                "<big><strong>Introduction</strong></big><br>When we scrutinize the opening phrase of <i>Sefer Rut</i> — וַיְהִי בִּימֵי שְׁפֹט הַשֹּׁפְטִים — we notice a major problem with the formulation of this four-word phrase. The words <i>shefot</i> and <i>vayehi</i> both seem unnecessary; it could have simply said בִּימֵי הַשֹּׁפְטִים and the story would have been placed into its historical setting. What do these words teach us?",
                "<b>Three Explanations — Chazal, Ibn Ezra and Malbim</b><br>Various explanations have been set forth throughout the generations, which for the most part are variations on the same theme. Chazal (Bava Batra 15b) explain as follows: מאי דכתיב (רות א) ויהי בימי שפוט השופטים דור ששופט את שופטיו אומר לו טול קיסם מבין שיניך אומר לו טול קורה מבין עיניך. When the judges criticized the people, the people would respond with a stronger reprove of the judges. In other words, it was a time when corruption was rampant throughout society, and no one was able to set proper standards.",
                "Ibn Ezra (to <i>pasuk</i> 1) writes that this was a time when Hashem was judging the judges for their poor deeds. The famine, Ibn Ezra explains, is a result of the misdeeds of the judges.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Communal punishment resulting from judges' misdeeds is a common theme in the teachings of Chazal. See, for example, <i>Avot</i> 5:8.</i> Malbim (to <i>pasuk</i> 1) explains that <i>Megillat Rut</i> transpires during one of the frequent interludes in Sefer Shofetim during which we did not have a strong leader guiding our people.",
                "We suggest a variation on Malbim that embraces the entire period of<i> Sefer Shofetim</i>. Our variation stems from the concluding <i>pasuk</i> of <i>Sefer Shofetim</i> בַּיָּמִים הָהֵם, אֵין מֶלֶךְ בְּיִשְׂרָאֵל: אִישׁ הַיָּשָׁר בְּעֵינָיו, יַעֲשֶׂה — in those times there was no king in Israel, and everyone did what is fit in his own eyes. This description serves as a defining characteristic of the entire time period. Consider, for example, when Devorah issues a call for help to Am Yisrael for help fighting Sisera, very few <i>shevatim</i> respond, reflecting a severe lack of cohesiveness. Sadly, <i>Sefer Shofetim</i> is replete with civil wars amongst our people that emerged due to the dearth of widely accepted leaders. Accordingly, בִּימֵי שְׁפֹט הַשֹּׁפְטִים refers to the time of <i>Sefer Shofetim</i>, which was a time of weak leadership.",
                "<b>A Negative Introduction</b><br>The common denominator of Chazal, Ibn Ezra and Malbim is that they understand וַיְהִי בִּימֵי שְׁפֹט הַשֹּׁפְטִים in a negative light. This negative understanding is supported by the interpretative tool of <i>davar ha’lameid mei’inyano</i>, interpreting in light of the broader context, looking at the rest of the pasuk which speaks of a famine.",
                "Another indication is the seemingly unnecessary introductory word וַיְהִי. There are four times in Tanach (in addition to Rut 1:1) where וַיְהִי בִּימֵי introduces an episode:",
                "1. Bereishit 14:1 א וַיְהִי, בִּימֵי אַמְרָפֶל מֶלֶךְ-שִׁנְעָר, אַרְיוֹךְ, מֶלֶךְ אֶלָּסָר; כְּדָרְלָעֹמֶר מֶלֶךְ עֵילָם, וְתִדְעָל מֶלֶךְ גּוֹיִם. ב עָשׂוּ מִלְחָמָה",
                "2. <i>Yeshayahu</i> 7:1 א וַיְהִי בִּימֵי אָחָז בֶּן-יוֹתָם בֶּן-עֻזִּיָּהוּ מֶלֶךְ יְהוּדָה, עָלָה רְצִין מֶלֶךְ-אֲרָם וּפֶקַח בֶּן-רְמַלְיָהוּ מֶלֶךְ-יִשְׂרָאֵל יְרוּשָׁלִַם, לַמִּלְחָמָה, עָלֶיהָ; וְלֹא יָכֹל, לְהִלָּחֵם עָלֶיהָ.",
                "3. <i>Yirmiyahu</i> 1:3 ג וַיְהִי, בִּימֵי יְהוֹיָקִים בֶּן-יֹאשִׁיָּהוּ מֶלֶךְ יְהוּדָה, עַד-תֹּם עַשְׁתֵּי עֶשְׂרֵה שָׁנָה, לְצִדְקִיָּהוּ בֶן-יֹאשִׁיָּהוּ מֶלֶךְ יְהוּדָה--עַד-גְּלוֹת יְרוּשָׁלִַם, בַּחֹדֶשׁ הַחֲמִישִׁי.",
                "4. Esther 1:1 וַיְהִי, בִּימֵי אֲחַשְׁוֵרוֹשׁ <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">TABC<i> talmid</i> Akiva Prager asks, if this phrase introduces a negative episode, how does <i>“vayehi bi’yemei Achashveirosh”</i> introduce the negative events related to Haman, if Haman does not appear until the beginning of <i>perek</i> 3? One may answer that Achashveirosh is the great enabler of Haman (Megillah 14a). Alternatively, as Rabbi Yosef Dov Soloveitchik observed, an obsessively hedonistic society like the one described in <i>Esther perek</i> 1 paves the way for a morally bankrupt regime seeking the annihilation of an entire people. Rabbi Soloveitchik, we should note, remarked that he witnessed such degeneration first-hand when he lived in Germany from 1926 to 1933.</i>",
                "In each occurence, the phrase וַיְהִי בִּימֵי introduces a negative episode, as noted by Chazal (Megillah 10b).",
                "<b>The Overall Theme of <i>Megillat Rut</i> — From Chaos to David</b><br>Based on our understanding of the introduction of <i>Megillat Rut</i>, we may draw a conclusion about its overall theme and purpose. But first, a Tanach interpretative technique. In many <i>sefarim</i> of our holy Tanach<i>,</i> a contrast of the beginning and end of the <i>sefer</i> sheds light on its theme. This seems true regarding the following <i>sefarim:</i>",
                "1. <i>Sefer Shemot</i> — begins with <i>avdut</i> and ends with the <i>shechina</i> entering the <i>mishkan</i>.",
                "2. <i>Sefer Shmuel</i> (Chazal say Shmuel authored <i>Megillat Rut</i>!) — begins with <i>shofet</i> and the <i>mishkan</i> and ends with David HaMelech taking the first step to build the Beit HaMikdash.",
                "3. <i>Sefer Melachim</i> — begins with David HaMelech and ends with the <i>Churban</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I entitled my book on <i>Sefer Melachim</i> “From David to Destruction” for this reason.</i>",
                "4. <i>Sefer Yechezkel </i>— begins with Yechezkel receiving <i>nevuah</i> during <i>galut Bavel</i> and ends with a description of the future Beit HaMikdash.",
                "Now, let us compare the beginning and end of <i>Megillat Rut</i> in order to better understand its overall theme. The <i>sefer</i> begins with a period of corruption and negativity and concludes with mention of David HaMelech. Thus, we may argue that <i>Megillat Rut</i> teaches about how our people made the transition from the failures of the period of the <i>shofetim</i> to the successes of the times of David HaMelech. Self-centered interest would not bring us to the strong national entity that was developed during the times of David. Only once we coalesce as a community of giving can a sense of national unity and identity ultimately emerge.",
                "<i><b>Megillat Rut</b></i><b> — The Reward for Chesed</b><br>Now let’s analyze a famous but very difficult Midrash – Rut Rabbah 2:14 \"אמר ר' זעירא:",
                "מגילה זו אין בה לא טומאה ולא טהרה ולא איסור ולא היתר, ולמה נכתבה? ללמדך שכר טוב לגומלי חסדים",
                "In other words, <i>Megillat Rut</i> does not teach us any Halachot. Rather, it is written to teach us the reward bestowed on those who engage in kind deeds.",
                "There are two major difficulties with this Midrash. First, <i>Megillat Rut</i> is a veritable treasure trove of sources for a wide variety of Halachot. These include Halachot regarding <i>geirut</i>, marriage, inheritance, and <i>kinyan suddar</i>. Second, the Tanach — in sections much earlier than Megillat Rut — teaches the reward for<i> gomlei chasadim</i>. For instance, <i>Sefer Bereishit </i>records how Rivka is chosen as one of the <i>Imahot </i>due to her extraordinary chesed.",
                "In light of our discussion, we can suggest a deeper meaning of this Midrash. The Midrash teaches that the primary message of <i>Megillat Rut</i> is not the many Halachot that we derive from this rich story. Rather, the central theme is that of reward and punishment — the reward for those who are giving and the punishment for the self-centered. <i>Megillat Rut</i> begins with a searing description of the terrible downfall of Elimelech, Machlon and Kilyon due to self-centered and self-serving behavior. It concludes with the great reward ultimately bestowed upon Rut, who is characterized by Chazal as the mother of royalty and whose kindness to her mother-in-law Naomi is astounding. Her ultimate reward in this world, teach Chazal, is her presence at the royal inauguration of her great-great-grandson Shlomo HaMelech (Bava Batra 91b).",
                "<b>Conclusion — Chesed: The Recipe for Success in Life</b><br>The lessons for us run deep and wide. Any community, from the smallest to the largest, must follow the recipe set forth in <i>Megillat Rut </i>— fostering the willingness to give and eschewing self-centeredness — in order to achieve success. A marriage must be characterized by<i> ani le’dodi ve’dodi li</i>, with each partner looking to give to the other. One who enters marriage with a self-centered attitude, thinking “what’s in this for me?” is doomed to fail. A community composed of people solely focused on what the community can do for them will not flourish. Rather, in order to succeed, a community needs its members to think, “what can I do for the community?” The same applies for a larger community — the people must be devoted to each other as well as the leadership and the leadership must be devoted to serving the people."

                "<big><strong>Understanding Elimelech's Death</strong></big><br>Chazal and the classic <i>mefarshim</i> presume that Elimelech died prematurely due to sin. What prompts this understanding? The interpretative techniques — <i>middot she’haTorah nidreshet ba’hem </i>— of <i>davar ha’lameid mei’inyano </i>and <i>semichut parshiot</i> are possible answers. The context and connection of the <i>pesukim</i> are ones of unusual suffering (famine) and premature death (Machlon and Kilyon dying childless). This leads us to conclude that Elimelech’s death is also premature. But what did Elimelech do that prompted such severe punishment?",
                "<b>Answer #1 — Abandoning Eretz Yisrael</b><br>Bava Batra 91b cites Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai (Rashbi)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Interestingly, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai is typically referred to in the Mishna in Halachic contexts as Rabbi Shimon. However, in certain highly poignant Agaddic contexts he is referred to as Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. I suggest that when Chazal append Bar Yochai to Rabbi Shimon they might be signaling that a profound idea is about to be expressed.</i> as explaining that the reason for Elimelech’s premature death is that he abandoned Eretz Yisrael.",
                "Interestingly, one might consider the time period in which Rashbi lived. As one of the five “new” <i>talmidim</i> of Rabbi Akiva, Rashbi lived in the aftermath of the brutal Roman suppression of the Bar Kochva revolt, when life in Eretz Yisrael was extraordinarily difficult and Jews were leaving Eretz Yisrael for Bavel in droves. In pointing to Elimelech’s sin of abandonment of Eretz Yisrael, might Rashbi have been sending a message to the Jews of his time, warning them not to leave Eretz Yisrael due to the difficult circumstances?",
                "We must consider, though, whether this contextual perspective is a valid way to look at Chazal and later <i>mefarshim</i>. Many argue that we should understand the timeless teachings of Chazal independently from their specific life circumstances.",
                "<b>Elimelech vs. Avraham Avinu</b><br>Of course, the major question that emerges is how Elimelech differs from Avraham Avinu, who left Eretz Yisrael due to famine. Ramban (Bereishit 12:10) considers this act of Avraham Avinu to be sinful, which seems to be in line with Rashbi’s understanding that Elimelech’s sin was that he left Eretz Yisrael. Furthermore, this suggests that Sarah Imeinu's captivity by Pharaoh is a punishment for leaving Eretz Yisrael. Nevertheless, Avraham and Sarah’s safe exit from their encounter with Pharaoh, in good health and great wealth, leads most<i> mefarshim </i>to conclude that it was not sinful when Avraham Avinu left Eretz Yisrael.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi to Bereishit 12:10 s.v. <i>“Ra’av Ba’aretz”</i> and 26:2, for example, disagrees with Ramban.</i>",
                "The <i>mefarshim</i> endeavor to distinguish between Avraham Avinu and Elimelech. Some note that <i>Devarim perek </i>11, the second <i>parasha </i>of <i>k’riat Shema</i>, teaches that if we perform mitzvot then we receive rain and if we abandon Hashem and do not perform mitzvot then we do not receive rain. Thus, Elimelech as a leader should have led an effort to end the famine by rallying our people to improve their devotion to Hashem instead of leaving Eretz Yisrael. Avraham Avinu did not have this option.",
                "<b>Answer #2 — Abandoning His People</b><br>One may argue that this <i>parasha </i>of <i>k’riat Shema </i>is irrelevant to Avraham Avinu, since it was presented long after his lifetime. It is relevant for Elimelech, though. Rashbi notes that since Elimelech was the <i>gadol ha’dor<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In this context, the term <i>gadol hador</i> does not seem to mean the supreme rabbinic authority, such as with Rabbi Moshe Feinstein. Rather, it means a top leader. The indications of Elimelech’s immense wealth in the text may be the fact that Moav, renowned for its stinginess, permits him to settle in their land. Also, the fact that his relative Boaz is a man of great wealth might indicate that the family is a wealthy one.</i>, </i>it was his responsibility to recognize that the famine was a result of the people’s sinful behavior — <i>“bi’yemei shefot ha’shofetim.”</i> Elimelech should have rallied the Jewish people to <i>teshuva</i>, which would have ended the famine. He is therefore punished for abandoning his responsibility and leaving Eretz Yisrael at a time when he should have instead led B’nei Yisrael to <i>teshuvah.</i>",
                "This relates to the response given by the Lubavitcher Rebbe when asked why he did not make aliyah: The captain does not leave the ship. In the case of Elimelech, he was punished for leaving his ship. Thus, Elimelech’s death was not due to his leaving Eretz Yisrael per se, but rather the sin of abandoning his flock during their hour of greatest need[2].",
                "We should note that in contrast to the selfish Elimelech, Rav Shimon Shkop, the great Rosh Yeshiva, returned to war-torn Europe in the late 1930’s after a fundraising trip to the United States, so as not to abandon his <i>talmidim</i> in their time of greatest distress. The same is told of Rav Yitzchak Herzog, Ashkenazic Chief Rabbi, who returned from America to Eretz Yisrael in 1943 when the then-undefeated Nazis were a mere ninety miles away from Eretz Yisrael.",
                "<b>Answer #3 — Anti-Chesed</b><br>The Midrash (Rut Rabbah 1:4) explains Elimelech’s punishment as follows:",
                "Elimelech was one of the leaders of the generation. When the years of famine arrived, he said that now Jews will besiege his home demanding financial support. Elimelech then escaped to Moav.",
                "From where in the <i>pesukim</i> might the Midrash derive this idea? One clue is Elimelech’s puzzling choice to move to Moav. The climate in Moav is identical to that of Eretz Yisrael; Elimelech would not achieve relief from the famine in Moav. Mitzrayim, with the dependable overflow of the Nile to the neighboring farmlands, would make a far better choice of destination during a famine. Moreover, during the period of the Shofetim, Moav and the Jewish people were at war (Eglon Melech Moav vs. Ehud ben Geira)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">TABC student Daniel Rothstein, however, argues that this war was limited to Binyamin and Moav and not a full war between Moav and all of Am Yisrael.</i>, all the more reason not to choose Moav.",
                "The answer lies in the reason we are forbidden to marry people from Moav (Devarim 23:4) — their failure to provide us food when we passed through their land. It seems irrational to permanently shun this nation due to poor behavior during one episode. However, Moav’s refusal to share water typifies this nation’s character. Moav emerged from Lot and his daughter, refugees from Sedom. This nation, therefore, perpetuates the evil legacy of Sedom, the shunning and even forbidding of chesed. Elimelech saw Moav as a haven for those fleeing pressure to engage in chesed, and chose to move to this bastion of anti-chesed in order to avoid pressure during a time of need.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">TABC <i>talmidim</i> Daniel Becker and Natan Rifkind explain the unusual presentation of Elimelech in <i>pesukim</i> 1 and 2 as the Tanach diminishing his stature. The introductory <i>pasuk</i> does not mention names, and only in <i>pasuk</i> 2 do we discover the names of the couple who abandon Beit Lechem during the famine. <i>Megillat Rut</i> goes out of its way to anonymize Elimelech in <i>pasuk</i> 1 to criticize his behavior. The Tanach diminishes Elimelech since by shirking his responsibilities he has diminished himself.</i>",
                "Furthermore, the psychological concept of projection, whereby one projects his own deficiencies onto others,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chazal were keenly aware of this concept. They express the idea as “<i>Kol ha’posel b’mumo posel”</i> (<i>Kiddushin</i> 70a) — whoever disqualifies, expresses his own deficiencies in doing so. Thus, if someone calls someone else a “loser” he shows that he considers himself to be a “loser.”</i> explains why Elimelech feared the Jewish people would besiege his home. Besieging a home and making demands is a Sedomite behavior, as seen in <i>Bereishit perek</i> 19. Thus, Elimelech harbors a Sedom character and projects Sedom-like behavior upon others.",
                "<i>Le’lamedcha Sechar Le’Gomlei Chasadim</i><br>As discussed above, the major theme of <i>Sefer Rut</i> is the reward conferred upon those who deal kindly and the punishment visited upon those who reject kindness. This is furthered by the approach that Elimelech’s severe punishment stems from fleeing his responsibility to help his community in a time of great need.",
                "<b>Combining Both Reasons</b><br>The two approaches we have outlined may be seen as fundamentally identical. Both revolve around the idea that punishment is meted out to one who shirks his responsibility.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rambam (<i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 5:9) ascribes the deaths of Machlon and Kilyon to their leaving Eretz Yisrael. However, he does not mention Elimelech in this Halacha. This indicates that Rambam sees the reason for Elimelech’s death as his refusal to engage in chesed at a time when it was sorely needed.</i> Indeed, Rashi (Rut 1:1 s.v. “<i>Va’yeilech Ish</i>”) does appear to combine these two reasons,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As noted by the Siftei Chachamim number three. </i> as he mentions both that Elimelech left Eretz Yisrael and that he refused to help the many people in need. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai seems to allude to the avoidance of chesed as well, since he describes Elimelech as one of the great <i>parnasei hador</i> (financial supporters of the time) and not just the <i>gadol hador</i>.</i>",
                "<b>Conclusion</b><br>The ethical legacy of Am Yisrael from the time of Avraham Avinu and Sarah Imeinu is one of chesed. In contrast, the ethical legacy of Moav is the Sedom-like rejection of chesed. Elimelech was a Jew who, in both ideology and lifestyle, becomes a Moabite and fails miserably. Rut, on the other hand, is a Moabite woman, who by dint of her extraordinary chesed becomes a Jew — not only in name but in ideology and lifestyle — and achieves great success."

Obviously, an explanation is needed.",
                "While the names sickness and destruction do reflect the untimely deaths of these men and that they died childless, why would they be given such a name at the outset of their lives?",
                "<b>Explanation #1 — Not Their Real Names</b><br>Sometimes, names in Tanach do not seem to be the peoples’ actual names. For example, in <i>Sefer Bereishit</i> the name of the head of the city of Shechem, Chamor, does not seem to be his name. It is, rather, what Tanach’s author — i.e. Hashem — thinks of him (and perhaps his constituents as well). Another example is Eglon Melech Moav of <i>Sefer Shofetim</i>. Eglon, meaning fat bull, is unlikely to be his true name. However, it does reflect what the author of <i>Sefer Shofetim</i> (Shmuel HaNavi, according to Chazal) wants us to think of him.",

                "<b>Explanation #2 — A Choice of Destiny</b><br>Da’at Mikra, though, notes that Machlon and Kilyon need not necessarily mean death and destruction. Machlon might derive from “<i>mechol</i>,” meaning joyful dance, and Kilyon may derive from the word “<i>va’yechal</i>,” meaning completion. This leads us to an enticing explanation of these names, especially according to the Kabbalistic tradition that <i>ru’ach hakodesh</i> impacts parents when they name their children. (See the Ari’s <i>Sha’ar Hagilgulim</i>, <i>hakdama</i> 23, and also the Gemara, <i>Yoma</i> 83b, which states that a person’s name expresses his essential character.)",
                "In <i>Sefer Yonah perek </i>3, Yonah tells the people of Nineveh that in forty days they will be “nehepachet.” Rashi to <i>Yonah</i> 3:4 explains that the word “<i>nehepachet”</i>  in Yonah’s very brief address to Nineveh can mean either destroyed or reformed. In this address, he conveyed the divine message that they have a choice to either change their ways or be destroyed. You decide, Hashem says. You write the script of your life.",
                "Similarly, by giving names that can mean either happiness or tragedy, Hashem gives a choice to Machlon and Kilyon — you choose your destiny. It is up to you. The dual meanings of their names convey that they were not <i>destined </i>to fail — they could either have a joyful life or a life of destruction. Unfortunately, they chose poorly, which led to their downfall.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The same may be said regarding the destiny Yaakov Avinu assigned Shimon and Levi, that they will be scattered among the Jewish people (Bereishit 49:7). Yaakov Avinu told Shimon and Levi that they were to decide and shape their own destiny — they can choose to be scattered due to failure, or they can choose to be scattered due to tbeing the spiritual leaders of Am Yisrael. Levi and his family resolved to dramatically “up their game,” and became the best they could be.

                "Sadly, Shevet Shimon wound up failing miserably in <i>Sefer Bamidbar</i>, with the culmination of their leading roles in the terrible sin with Midianite women at Pe’or. Shevet Shimon were stripped of their status of a <i>shevet</i>, as evidenced by the absence of a <i>bracha </i>for them in <i>Parashat V’zot HaBracha</i>. Likewise, <i>Sefer Yehoshua</i> records that Shimon received no independent portion in the Land of Israel, and they lived merely as an adjunct to Shevet Yehuda.",
                "<b>Conclusion</b><br>Hashem sets forth similar choices for each of us. He provides us with options as to whether we will succeed or fail — it all depends on us. We can bend the scripts of our life stories to either the positive or negative side. Machlon and Kilyon sadly set a bad example of exercising poor judgment in their life choices.

This seems to be a blatant violation of לִפְנֵי עִוֵּר, לֹא תִתֵּן מִכְשֹׁל — the prohibition to encourage sin (<i>Vayikra </i>19:14; this prohibition applies even to encourage <i>Nochrim</i> to violate their seven mitzvot, as stated in <i>Pesachim</i> 22b). <i>Pasuk</i> 15 seems to be especially problematic, as Naomi explicitly tried to convince Rut to return to <i>avodah zarah</i>!",
                "To intensify the question, we note several points:",
                "1. It is especially problematic according to Ibn Ezra, who argues that Rut and Orpah had undergone a conversion. Although this conversion is substandard, it still seems wrong to encourage Rut and Orpah to return to their Moabite ways.",
                "2. Naomi seems to violate much more than <i>lifnei iver — </i>Naomi seems to violate <i>meisit</i>– a very severe prohibition! <i>Lifnei iver</i> refers to facilitating sin, while <i>meisit</i> refers to convincing people to sin. In <i>Devarim perek</i> 13, we see that <i>meisit</i> is depicted as a heinous sin of the highest order.",
                "3. Moreover, every generation follows the model set forth by Naomi (Yevamot 47b), by discouraging others from joining our people. Why? If they do not join, they will likely serve <i>avodah zarah</i> — so why do we not focus our efforts on rescuing people from sin?",
                "Finally, the extreme spiritual descent of Orpah after she left Naomi leads us to question the wisdom of Naomi in encouraging Orpah to leave and return to the depraved culture of Moav.4.",
                "<b>Background for an Answer</b><br>The Gemara (<i>Yevamot </i>109b) makes a remarkable statement that “evil after evil will befall those who accept converts.” <i>Tosafot</i> (ad. loc. s.v. <i>“Ra’ah”</i>) limit the Gemara’s declaration to a <i>beit din</i> that either seeks to convince <i>Nochrim</i> to convert or converts individuals indiscriminately or impulsively. If, <i>Tosafot</i> continue, the candidate is persistent in his desire to convert, like Rut, then we should accept him.",
                "<i>Tosafot</i> support their assertion by citing examples of outstanding <i>batei din</i>, such as those of Yehoshua<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to Chazal (Megillah 14b), Yehoshua accepted Rachav as a convert.</i> and Hillel (<i>Shabbat </i>31a), who accepted sincere <i>geirim</i>. Although the individuals who came to him were hardly viable candidates for conversion at first — one of them denied the validity of the oral law — Hillel was confident that with patience and wisdom he would be able to shepherd them to full acceptance of Torah, an expectation that he fulfilled. Moreover, <i>Tosafot</i> cite the example of Timna (Bereishit 36:12), who, according to Chazal (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 99b), was unjustifiably denied conversion by our <i>Avot</i> (forefathers).  Out of bitterness, she agreed to be a concubine to Eisav’s son Elifaz and bore Amaleik, who perpetually inflicts great pain upon Israel.",
                "Accordingly, although <i>batei din</i> must not reject those with genuine commitment to become successful <i>geirim</i> who will lead fully observant lives, they must exercise caution and not hastily or indiscriminately convert candidates for <i>geirut</i>. Indeed, this Gemara records a shocking teaching of Chazal that converts are as difficult for the Jewish people as skin disease! This assertion, Rashi explains, refers to converts who do not adequately prepare for conversion and subsequently fail to integrate into the Jewish people after conversion (unlike Rut who integrates magnificently).",
                "Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (<i>Teshuvot Minchat Shlomo</i> 1:35) writes that converting someone who will not observe Torah U’Mitzvot, itself violates <i>lifnei iver</i>, since now Hashem holds him accountable for not observing the 613 mitzvot. Thus, it is critical that rabbis of each generation exercise prudence and admit only converts who are, like Rut, thoroughly committed to the Jewish people and Torah life. Acting otherwise runs counter to the best interests of the Jewish people and the convert.",
                "<b>A Ruling of Rabbi Moshe Shternbuch</b><br>Rabbi Moshe Shternbuch (<i>Teshuvot VeHanhagot</i> 1:483) was asked by a newly-observant man if he was permitted to invite his parents to Shabbat evening dinner knowing that they would drive home after the meal. Rabbi Shternbuch permits the invitation, especially given that the child told his parents that he was upset with them driving on Shabbat.",
                "Rabbi Shternbuch makes a bold assertion regarding the prohibition of <i>lifnei iver</i>. He argues that this restriction applies only if one seeks to harm the other individual. However, one does not violate <i>lifnei iver </i>if his intention is to help the other person. Rabbi Shternbuch argues that <i>lifnei iver </i>is analogous to the prohibition to wound (<i>chavalah</i>) in this regard; just as it is permitted to “wound” for therapeutic purposes, such as a surgeon performing a needed operation, so too one is permitted to cause another Jew to sin in order to benefit them. Since the man intended to help his parents by inviting them to a Shabbat meal, and thereby bringing them closer to Torah observance, he does not violate <i>lifnei iver</i>. Rabbi Shternbuch notes that in the case in question, the parents were positively disposed towards being drawn closer to Torah life, and the Shabbat meal invitations were indeed part of the process of supporting their return to religious observance.",
                "Although Rabbi Shternbuch does not cite any precedent for his view, we can garner support for his approach from a suggestion made by Rabbi Akiva Eiger (<i>Yoreh Deah</i> 181:6). Some background information is needed to understand this suggestion. First, we must note that a man is forbidden to shave his face with a razor (<i>makif</i>) and is forbidden to be shaved by a razor (<i>nikaf</i>; see <i>Makkot</i> 20b). A woman is not included in this prohibition (<i>Kiddushin</i> 1:7), but violates <i>lifnei iver </i>if she shaves a man’s face with a razor (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> ad. loc.).",
                "Rabbi Akiva Eiger suggests that if a man is determined to shave with a razor and cannot be persuaded to refrain from such activity, it is better for a woman to shave him than for him to shave himself. He reasons that had the man shaved himself, he would violate two prohibitions, shaving and being shaved. If the woman shaves him, though, he violates only one prohibition, that of being shaved. Even though the woman herself seemingly violates the prohibition of <i>lifnei iver</i> by shaving the man, Rabbi Akiva Eiger permits her to shave him. This suggestion supports Rabbi Shternbuch’s approach that one is not in violation of <i>lifnei iver</i> if in the bigger picture he is helping that person.",
                "<b>Choosing Between Bad and Worse</b><br>We see from Rabbi Akiva Eiger that one does not violate <i>lifnei iv</i>er if, when one is faced with a choice of bad or worse, he chooses the bad option instead of a worse option. A woman shaving a man is a bad option. However, the man shaving himself is a worse option. Thus, according to Rabbi Akiva Eiger, one does not violate <i>lifnei iveir </i>when choosing bad over worse since his intentions are to help and not to harm.",
                "In Rabbi Shternbuch’s case, while it is bad to encourage Jews to drive on Shabbat, it is worse to allow people to spiritually founder and lose connection with Torah life. Thus, he permits choosing the less bad option over the even worse alternative. Although one is encouraging a bad option, in the bigger picture he is helping, since the alternative is worse.",
                "<b>Defending Naomi</b><br>Naomi faced a similar dilemma. Just imagine what would have happened had Naomi not discouraged Orpah to return to Moav. Naomi and her daughters-in-law were desperately poor and heading to a society that seethed in resentment towards Naomi’s family’s abandonment of Beit Lechem during desperate times. Orpah would never have withstood such a challenging situation.",
                "Orpah, who loved her mother-in-law and possibly even Jewish values, lacked the grit and fortitude to remain steadfast in her commitment to Naomi and Jewish life in the face of enormous challenges. Once she would have confronted the challenges of Beit Lechem, Orpah would have likely turned around and headed for Moav.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a suggestion of TABC <i>talmidim</i> Daniel Becker and Natan Rifkind.</i> Such a reversal would have constituted a massive <i>chilul Hashem</i>, had Naomi failed to warn her.",
                "Worse yet, Orpah could have felt trapped and unable to return to Moav. Orpah would seethe with resentment and likely would have negatively impacted Naomi and Rut, as well as other Jews. She would likely be a convert who is seen by the Gemara as comparable to skin disease, a separate part of the body that does not assimilate into the body. Instead, it remains a festering sore, negatively impacting those in the broader environment. Thus, Naomi encouraging her daughters-in-law to return to their Moabite families, while a bad option, is a better choice than encouraging them to travel with her to Eretz Yisrael.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even if we assume that Orpah had undergone a sort of conversion before her marriage to Kilyon, it is still preferable for her to return to Moav than to make an unsuccessful attempt to upgrade her conversion and properly integrate with the Jewish people. </i>",
                "<b>The Necessity of Full Disclosure</b><br>When a young man approaches seeking advice as to whether to volunteer for the Israeli army, a similar approach must be adopted. While it is important to note the positive aspects of enlistment, one must not shy away from mentioning the serious challenges involved. The same must be said about those considering the rabbinate or medical school. While the rewards are great, there are formidable challenges involved in these commitments. Hiding the inevitable challenges serves no one’s long-term best interests. Negative results will likely ensue if one enters a challenging situation without being warned of the difficulties that lie ahead. If one is forewarned and makes the commitment to forge ahead despite the difficulties, he is positioned to succeed and manage the challenges.",
                "A convert must be forewarned about the challenges involved in Jewish life. When I brought a candidate for conversion before a <i>beit din </i>in 2019, the <i>beit din</i> more than once raised the issue of the high cost of Orthodox life in the United States. The <i>beit din</i> also did not shy away from mentioning the Holocaust. While raising these issues causes many to flee to a lifestyle that includes <i>avodah zarah</i> and the deplorably low moral standards of much of contemporary western society, it is a better option than allowing someone to convert absent full disclosure. Failing to inform the conversion candidate would harm the candidate, those close to the candidate, and the broader Jewish community.",
                "<b>Conclusion — Naomi Sets the Model of Full Disclosure</b><br>Our choices are sometimes not between bad and good, but between bad and worse. Naomi’s dilemma is identical to the dilemma faced by <i>batei din</i> for <i>giyur</i> (conversion) in all generations. While it is a bad option to encourage return to a decadent society, it is better than refraining from properly preparing to successfully deal with Jewish life. Naomi sets the model of testing for commitment. Those who follow in the path of Rut and display a commitment to overcome adversity are to be enthusiastically welcomed. However, those unable to make such a commitment are better off not joining the fold."

                "<big><strong>Rut's Motivation to Convert</strong></big><br>Boaz praised Rut as an ideal convert. In <i>perek</i> 2 <i>pasuk</i> 11, Boaz described Rut’s decision to leave her homeland and family in the same terms as Avraham Avinu leaving his homeland for Eretz Yisrael. In fact, a convert is identified in Halachic documents as <i>ben</i> or <i>bat</i> Avraham Avinu. It is indeed a very high honor to be identified as a child of Avraham Avinu.",
                "Moreover, in the next <i>pasuk</i>, Boaz described Rut as coming under the wings of the <i>Shechinah</i>. This describes the very essence of <i>geirut </i>(conversion). <i>Milah</i> and <i>tevilah</i> (immersion in a <i>mikvah</i>) are merely acts of conversion, external manifestations of the convert’s inner experience of seeking shelter under the comforting wings of the Almighty. Rambam (<i>Hilchot Dei’ot</i> 6:4 and <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi’ah</i> 13:4) describes the essence of conversion as coming beneath the wings of the Shechinah, following Boaz’s perspective.",
                "<b>A Problem — Did Rut Love Hashem or Naomi?</b><br>Over the years, TABC <i>talmidim</i> have noted that Rut in <i>perek</i> 1 <i>pesukim</i> 16-17 did not utter any iconic Jewish expression of devotion to Hashem, such as <i>“Hashem Hu ha’Elokim” </i>or <i>“Shema Yisrael”.</i> Rather, she couched her devotion to Torah in terms of her devotion to Naomi: “Your nation is my nation, your God is my God, where you will go I will go, where you will sleep I will sleep, where you will die I will die and there I will be buried.”",
                "Rut seemed to be devoted to Naomi, rather than to Hashem! In the words of one <i>talmid</i>, “had Naomi worshipped sea monsters, Rut would have become a devoted sea monster worshipper.” Why, then, do Chazal (Yevamot 47a) view Rut’s declaration to Naomi as an ideal expression of Torah commitment?",
                "<b>Basis for Our Answer – A <i>Teshuvah</i> from Rabbi Moshe Feinstein</b><br>The following situation is described in <i>Teshuvot Igrot Moshe</i> (volume 9 <i>Even Ha’Ezer</i> 14). Rabbi Moshe Feinstein responded to an inquiry from Brazil regarding the daughter of a non-Jewish woman (and a Jewish father) who was raised Jewish, attended Jewish schools, and was observant of Halacha. This woman only discovered that she was not Halachically Jewish upon becoming engaged to marry a fully observant Jew. The question posed was whether the <i>beit din</i> should be wary of converting such an individual. Rabbi Feinstein answered that the <i>beit din</i> should not hesitate to convert her. Even though one might have argued that such a conversion should be deemed a conversion for ulterior motives (i.e., to be able to marry the man to whom she was engaged), that was not the case here, as the reason she was interested in marrying a fully observant Jewish man was because of her Jewish upbringing and commitment to Jewish life.",
                "<b>Explaining Rut</b><br>Just as the bride in Rabbi Feinstein’s case was interested in the observant Jewish man because of his values, so too Rut loved Naomi and was so devoted to her because of the Torah values Naomi represented. As much as Rut loved Naomi, no healthy minded individual (and it is clear from the conversations recorded in <i>Megillat Rut</i> that Rut is a self-assured healthy minded person) would have joined Naomi in her journey to Eretz Yisrael if her commitment to Naomi had not been grounded in the love of  Hashem. It is for this very reason that Orpah returned to Moav.",
                "Rut’s love for Naomi brought Rut to love Hashem, which then emerged as independent of her love for Naomi. Boaz, in turn, is deeply touched by Rut’s devotion to her mother-in-law and the Jewish people. He sees how hard Rut works, her willingness to collect among the poor, and her dogged determination to help her mother-in-law and herself. Were it not for Rut’s deep devotion to Hashem, she would have left this miserable existence and returned to Moav.",

They viewed Timna’s interest in conversion as being motivated by her interest in marrying a member of the families of the Avot, and so they rejected her. While it was true that she was interested in marrying into the family, her primary motivation was altruistic, and her interest in marrying into the family was solely because those were the people who shared her belief system.",

                "[A Torah student] heard that there was a woman of ill repute in a faraway city who charged four hundred gold talents for her services. He sent her the exorbitant fee and set an appointed time to meet her. When he arrived at the appointed time... as he was unclothing himself, the four fringes of his <i>tzitzit</i> slapped him in his face. He immediately slid off the bed on to the floor, where he was quickly joined by the woman. “I swear by the Roman Caesar,\" the harlot exclaimed, \"I will not leave you until you reveal to me what flaw you have found in me!\" \"I swear,\" the Jew replied, \"that I have never seen a woman as beautiful as you. However, there is one mitzvah that we were commanded by our God, and <i>tzitzit</i> is its name. Concerning this mitzvah the Torah twice states 'I am the Lord your God' — 'I am the one who will seek retribution, and I am the one who will reward.' Now the four <i>tzitzit</i> appeared to me as four witnesses, testifying to this truth. \"I still will not leave you,\" the prostitute said, \"until you provide me with your name, the names of your city, rabbi and the school in which you study Torah. \"He wrote down all the information and handed it to her. The woman sold all her possessions. A third of the money she gave to the government (as a payoff so that they would allow her to convert to Judaism), a third she handed out to the poor, and the remaining third she took with her — along with the silver and gold beds — and she proceeded to the school which the man had named, the study hall of Rabbi Chiya. \"Rabbi,\" she said to Rabbi Chiya, \"I would like to convert to Judaism.\" \"Perhaps,\" Rabbi Chiya responded, \"you desire to convert because you have taken a liking to a Jewish man?\" The woman pulled out the piece of paper with the information [and apparently related to Rabbi Chiya all that transpired with the Jew she had encountered]. \"You may go and claim that which is rightfully yours,\" Rabbi Chiya proclaimed. She ended up marrying the man. the woman’s incredible sacrifice clearly demonstrates that her interest in marrying the Jewish man was motivated by her desire to marry a man with a similar belief system. For this reason, the great Rabbi Chiya felt she was entitled to convert.",

If the candidate demonstrates he or she is following in the footsteps of Rut, then he or she will be accepted with open arms into the fold and counted as a proud successor to Rut, Avraham Avinu, and all the many outstanding <i>geirim</i> among our people."

                "<b>Approach #2 — Hashem Has Not Abandoned Naomi</b><br>However, the Midrash (<i>Rut</i> <i>Rabbah</i> 3:7) presents a shocking approach, which neither Rashi nor Ibn Ezra have cited — דָּבָר אַחֵר, וַה' עָנָה בִי, <b>כָּל עִנְיָנֶיהָ לָא הֲוָה אֶלָּא בִי</b>, לְפִי שֶׁבָּעוֹלָם הַזֶּה וַה' עָנָה בִי<b>, אֲבָל לֶעָתִיד לָבוֹא מַה כְּתִיב (ירמיה לב, מא): וְשַׂשְׂתִּי עֲלֵיהֶם לְהֵטִיב אוֹתָם</b>. Naomi claimed that Hashem targeted <i>her</i>. However, according to the Midrash, she exclaimed that there is a positive side to this: It indicates that in the future, Hashem will extend great help.",
                "This is reminiscent of the famous story presented at the end of <i>Makkot</i>, regarding Rabbi Akiva’s reaction to seeing a fox scurrying along <i>Har HaBayit</i>. Rabbi Akiva famously exclaims, עכשיו שנתקיימה נבואתו של אוריה בידוע שנבואתו של זכריה מתקיימת, that the fulfillment of the negative <i>nevuah</i> heralds the fulfillment of the positive<i> nevuah</i>.",

                "Naomi, in her harsh words in <i>pasuk</i> 21, insisted that Hashem had not abandoned her. By this insistence, she says that Hashem will intervene on her behalf in the future — which in fact He does, as we see in the rest of <i>Megillat Rut</i>.",

                "To solve our problem, we must contrast <i>pasuk</i> 21 with the manner in which we have seen Naomi reflect on Hashem in <i>pesukim</i> 6, 8 and 13. Naomi did not speak so harshly about Hashem in these earlier <i>pesukim</i>. <i>Pasuk</i> 13 records Naomi saying that the Hand of Hashem has gone out against her, but this is still a far milder statement than her biting words recorded in <i>pasuk</i> 21. What moves Naomi to speak so harshly in <i>pasuk</i> 21?",
                "An answer emerges from <i>pasuk</i> 19, which records that the entire city reacts to Naomi’s return. Ibn Ezra (to <i>pasuk</i> 19 s.v. “<i>Ha’zot Naomi</i>”) explains, following his usual <i>peshat</i>-oriented approach, that since Naomi is from a prominent family, her arrival aroused the attention of the entire city.",
                "The Midrash (<i>Rut</i> <i>Rabbah</i> 3:6), however, understands that the entire city happened to be present at the time of her arrival. The Midrash offers a variety of explanations as to why this happened. Rashi (to <i>pasuk</i> 19 s.v. “<i>Va’teihom</i>” and s.v. “<i>Ha’zot Naomi</i>”) adopts the approach that it was the time of the burial of Boaz’s wife. We suggest that perhaps it was the reaction of the women of Beit Lechem that prompted Naomi to react harshly in <i>pasuk</i> 21. Although one might see the words “Is this Naomi?” as mild, the Midrashic explanation suggests otherwise. Naomi must have felt thoroughly humiliated by the women contrasting Naomi’s exalted state upon leaving and her wretched state upon return.",
                "Consider the Halachot regarding <i>ona’at devarim</i> presented <i>Bava Metzia</i> 58b. The Mishna and Gemara articulate the prohibition to inflict verbal abuse. An example of verbal abuse is accusing a suffering person of suffering due to sinning.",
                "The Torah way is to warmly greet a starving and ragged person, and to offer food, proper clothing and support. Even though the people of Beit Lechem harbor deep resentment of Naomi and her family for abandoning Beit Lechem during their hour of great need, the Torah prohibits taking revenge.

                "We must also consider that Tanach teaches that we can detect Hashem’s involvement when we witness amazing timing. <i>Megillat Esther</i> is full of such situations. A famous example is that Achashveirosh read about how Mordechai saved him just as Haman enters the palace to ask permission to kill Mordechai. Another is that Achashveirosh reentered the palace just as Haman fell on Esther’s bed.",
                "The fact that all of Beit Lechem attended the funeral of Boaz’s wife just as Naomi and Rut enter Beit Lechem compounds Naomi’s humiliation. She recognizes that Hashem clearly orchestrates this confrontation. This “coincidence” and the gross insensitivity of the women of Beit Lechem explain Naomi’s harsh reaction.

Furthermore, the phrase “<i>Elchah na</i> — I will go, please” appears to be an odd formulation, an unusual way to request permission. A more appropriate choice would seem to be “<i>Ha’elech </i>— may I go?” as Miriam asked when she requested permission from Bat Pharaoh to bring a Jewish woman to nurse baby Moshe (<i>Shemot</i> 2:7): “הַאֵלֵךְ וְקָרָאתִי לָךְ אִשָּׁה מֵינֶקֶת.” Why did Rut use these words?",
                "The answer can be linked back to Moshe Rabbeinu. Moshe Rabbeinu used similar words in speaking to his father-in-law, requesting permission to return to Mitzrayim (<i>Shemot</i> 4:18 with Rashi) — “וַיֵּלֶךְ מֹשֶׁה וַיָּשָׁב אֶל-יֶתֶר חֹתְנוֹ, וַיֹּאמֶר לוֹ אֵלְכָה נָּא וְאָשׁוּבָה אֶל-אַחַי אֲשֶׁר-בְּמִצְרַיִם”. A great challenge arises when a child becomes the provider for, or more powerful than, the parent. (This happens in particular regarding elderly parents.) The challenge is how to maintain <i>kavod</i> despite the power shift. In the case of Moshe Rabbeinu, he was elected by Hashem to lead Am Yisrael from Mitzrayim, but he still respectfully requested permission to leave from his father-in-law. Similarly, Rut assumed responsibility for feeding herself and Naomi, but nonetheless Rut requested permission to gather food in light of the power shift challenge. This gesture is yet another way in which Rut allowed Naomi to retain her dignity.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">TABC <i>talmid</i> Yoni Weinreich adds that the great <i>kavod</i> shown by Rut to Naomi acts as a tikkun (correction) for her ancestor disgracing her father Lot by naming her child Moav.</i>",

After all, Chazal (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 32a) understand <i>Shemot</i> 23:5 as teaching that the recipient of chesed cannot expect his benefactor to do all the work for him. Additionally, why does the <i>pasuk</i> describe Rut as “<i>hamoaviah</i>,” if, according to Chazal, Rut had already properly converted?",
                "Malbim (to <i>pasuk</i> 2 s.v. <i>“Va’tomer Rut</i>”) explains that Rut realized it would be severely humiliating for Naomi to collect <i>leket</i>, given her former stature in Beit Lechem. Malbim marshals Chazal’s teaching that Rut is the daughter or descendent of Eglon Melech Moav to further his approach, explaining the use of the word “<i>hamoaviah</i>\" to emphasize her ancestry. He notes how difficult it must have been for someone of royal lineage like Rut to summon the inner strength to collect with the poor. Moreover, Rashi to <i>pasuk</i> 3 cites Chazal’s teaching that Rut left signs on the road, <i>le’havdil</i> Hansel and Gretel style, in order to know how to return home.

Moreover, the threat of starvation loomed large over Rut and Naomi. It was hardly the time to be fussy about where to obtain food!",
                "Rashi and Malbim explain that Rut proclaimed that she would work in a field only if its owner will graciously accept her presence. Despite the tremendous pressure of the situation, Rut did not want to compromise her dignity. No wonder Chazal say Rut descended from royalty!

This, of course, leads not only to the <i>geulah</i> of Rut and Naomi, but ultimately to all Jews and all of humanity.

Rashi explains that teaching the <i>ger</i> about <i>matnot aniyim</i> is intended to teach the <i>ger</i> not to prevent <i>aniyim</i> from taking from their property. In light of Rut 2:2, we can add that the Torah’s commandments of <i>leket</i>, <i>shichechah</i> and <i>pei’ah</i> are foundational mitzvot that express core values of chesed and care for others.

Showing respect is the remedy to many societal ills. Boaz insisted on invoking Hashem’s name as a reminder and warning that Hashem monitors our behavior. Including Hashem into our mindset raises awareness that Hashem holds us accountable for poor behavior and rewards positive behavior.",
                "<b>Approach #3 — the Vilna Gaon</b><br>The Vilna Gaon explains that Boaz inquired as to whether the <i>Shechinah</i> was present in his fields, because of the mixed presence of genders.

                "Let us consider the implications of this insight. Note, on the one hand, the concerns relevant to the mixing of the genders. On the other hand, the mixed environment facilitated Rut and Boaz meeting in a “natural setting,” and for their relationship to begin to grow. Without this meeting, their marriage would not have happened — no one would have made this against-all-odds <i>shidduch</i>! Consider that if not for this coed environment, David HaMelech (and Mashiach) would not be born! Likewise, recall how Yaakov Avinu and Rachel Imeinu also met in a nonorchestrated coed setting.",
                "Rambam (<i>Hilchot Yom Tov</i> 6:21) forcefully sets forth the need to separate the genders during times of celebration, especially when wine is being served. However, Rambam in <i>Hilchot Matnot Aniyim </i>does not mention a requirement to separate the genders when collecting <i>leket</i>, <i>shichechah</i> and <i>pei’ah</i>. Nor does Rambam in <i>Hilchot Sechirut</i> mention such a requirement in regards to the workplace. Apparently, a mixed environment is appropriate in a work or chesed setting, but not in a party-like setting.",
                "In this light, young men and women of marriageable age that are working together in <i>kiruv</i> and chesed projects seems most appropriate. However, we must also consider Rut Rabbah 4:6 — “כָּל הַנָּשִׁים מְשַׂחֲקוֹת עִם הַקּוֹצְרִים, וְזוֹ מַצְנַעַת עַצְמָהּ,” all of the women “flirted” with the male workers except for Rut. Even in a permitted coed setting, <i>tzniut </i>must be observed. Rut, the Midrash teaches, did not “flirt” with the reapers as many of the other women did. Rather, she engaged in a meaningful conversation with a select member of the opposite gender, Boaz, with whom there was a prospect of marriage.",
                "<b>Approach #4 — Based on Rabbi Yehuda Bachrach’s <i>Ima Shel Malchut</i></b><br>Rabbi Bachrach understands that Boaz visited the field primarily to oversee the <i>aniyim</i> taking their <i>leket, shichechah.</i> and <i>pei’ah </i>from his fields. He explains that Halacha regards this as the responsibility of the field owner (<i>Pei’ah</i> 4:5 with Rabbi Ovadia Mi’Bartenura and Tiferet Yisrael). Based on these <i>mekorot</i>, “<i>Hashem Imachem”</i> can be read as a question (as in the Vilna Gaon’s approach). Boaz was asking, Is Hashem with you? Are you observing His laws regarding gifts to the poor?",
                "We can similarly understand the reapers’ response of “<i>yevarechecha Hashem</i>” based on Devarim 24:19, which teaches that Hashem blesses those who honor the mitzvot of leaving the various gifts to the poor. Accordingly, the reapers were saying that the Halachot were being fully observed, to the extent that the <i>bracha</i> promised by Hashem would be forthcoming.",
                "<b>Conclusion — The Sephardic Practice</b><br>“מנהג ישראל תורה היא” — the <i>minhagim</i> of the Jewish people is Torah. Rabbi Yosef Dov Soloveitchik understands this phrase, often used by many Rishonim and Acharonim, to express that we have an obligation to learn and understand our people’s <i>minhagim</i>.",
                "Based on these approaches to <i>pasuk</i> 4, we can explain the Sephardic <i>minhag</i>. Whether a reminder of Hashem’s presence like the approach of Malbim, an exchange of pleasant greetings like Ibn Ezra, or a question as to whether one is adhering to Hashem’s laws as Rabbi Bachrach explains, Boaz’s <i>takanah</i> remains in full force in Sephardic congregations. Maintaining Boaz’s <i>takanah</i> reminds us of its many crucial lessons.",

                "This Mishna explains that the poor are only entitled to one or two ears of grain, <i>shibolim</i>, that fall in the same spot. Boaz wondered how Rut had assembled <i>amorim</i> when <i>leket</i> applies only to <i>shibolim, </i>and recognized that she must have had an effective strategy and be a hard worker to be able to collect such a large amount from <i>leket</i>. According to Malbim, Boaz initially had no romantic intentions regarding Rut, and he did not know Rut before this encounter. Thus, Boaz spoke so kindly to Rut in <i>pesukim</i> 8-9 because he was impressed with her industrious collecting of grain and discovered her identity. He recognized her need and made sure she could provide for herself and Naomi.",
                "<b>Ibn Ezra and the Targum</b><br>According to Ibn Ezra (to <i>pesukim</i> 5 and 7), Boaz <i>did</i> have romantic intentions. Ibn Ezra understands Boaz to be inquiring as to whether Rut was a married woman.",

All the women raised their dresses [to work], but she let down her dress. All the women laughed with the reapers, but she was reserved by herself. All the women gleaned between the sheaves, but she gleaned from the public leavings.",

Why does the Midrash make this comparison? Apparently, both Shaul and Boaz misjudged: Shaul misjudged David and Boaz misjudged Rut. After David defeated Golyat, Shaul asked, <i>“Ben mi zeh hana’ar  — Whose son is this young man?” </i>As David had been playing the harp for Shaul before the battle with Golyat, Shaul already knew who he was. It seems that Shaul was remarking that he did not truly <i>know </i>this side of David. Similarly, Boaz knew who Rut was, as they were related, but when he saw her behavior in the field and how she conducted herself in a dignified manner, he realized that he did not <i>know </i>this side of her.",

Ibn Ezra and Ramban explain that according to the <i>peshat</i>, Kayin was confessing his guilt.

On a <i>derash </i>level, she may have been thinking of the Moabite restriction and giving <i>mussar </i>to Boaz for pursuing a relationship with her, as she was a Moabite woman. Thus, the <i>derash </i>approach to Boaz’s kind response to Rut is that he confirmed the sincerity and validity of her conversion and eligibility to marry within the Jewish People, even comparing Rut to Avraham Avinu.

                "<b>Malbim’s Answer</b><br>Malbim to <i>pasuk</i> 23 presents an answer based on the following Midrash (Rut Rabbah 5:11): וַתִּדְבַּק בְּנַעֲרוֹת בֹּעַז, אָמַר רַבִּי שְׁמוּאֵל בַּר נַחְמָן מִתְּחִלַּת קְצִיר שְׂעוֹרִים עַד כְּלוֹת קְצִיר הַחִטִּים - <b>שְׁלשָׁה חֳדָשִׁים </b>—<b> </b>there was a pause of three months. Malbim explains that three months is the time mandated by Halacha for a convert to wait before she marries, called <i>havchanah</i>. The Halacha to which Malbim refers, which is followed until today, appears in Yevamot 42a: גר וגיורת צריכין להמתין ג' חדשים להבחין בין זרע שנזרע בקדושה לזרע שלא נזרע בקדושה — both a male and female convert must wait three months after conversion before marriage.",
                "A careful examination of the dialogue between Rut and Naomi recorded in <i>pesukim</i> 20-22 (and see Malbim to <i>pasuk</i> 21) explains why this waiting period was very much necessary and appropriate. As noted by Malbim, Rut in <i>pasuk</i> 21 believed that Boaz wanted her to stay with his young men. Naomi, in <i>pasuk</i> 22, gently corrected Rut, explaining that Boaz wanted Rut to stay with his young women, which we see in <i>pasuk 23</i> that Rut then indeed did. Rut had not yet absorbed the Jewish way of life, in that she would stay with the men, which is not in line with Torah values of modesty. For this reason, explains Malbim, in <i>pasuk</i> 21 she is identified as a <i>“Moaviyah,”</i> since she stills thinks like a Moabite. Thus, Rut was very much in need of three months to adjust to Jewish living before she could move ahead with marriage. In <i>perek</i> 3 <i>pasuk</i> 1, Malbim explains, Naomi encouraged Rut to approach Boaz, since three months had passed since the conversion and Rut was finally ready to marry a Jewish man.",
                "<b>Rabbi Bachrach’s Answer</b><br>Rabbi Bachrach explains that Boaz was not ready for <i>yibbum/geulah</i> based on Chazal’s teaching (Bava Batra 91a) that Boaz had recently lost his wife, and that he had lost all of his sixty children during his lifetime. After experiencing these terrible losses, Boaz was not ready for marriage just yet since he was still grieving his losses.",
                "<b>TABC <i>Talmidim</i></b><br>Perhaps Boaz did not have a romantic interest in Rut. Instead, what he felt was a fatherly connection.

                "However, this might not be a compelling response, since later, during the romantically charged atmosphere in the granary, Boaz again referred to Rut as “my daughter” (<i>perek</i> 3 <i>pasuk</i> 10). This might have been an expression of romantic love, judging from the context. Boaz referring to Rut as “my daughter” also rejected Rut’s self-deprecating words that she was a foreigner; Boaz emphasized that Rut was part of the Jewish family. By referring to Rut as his “daughter,” Boaz spurned Beit Lechem’s rejection of Naomi and Rut.",

On the one hand, Rut was saying that she was not even worthy of serving as Boaz’s servant. On the other hand, perhaps she was hinting that she would not be one of his servants, but rather, she would be much more than that — his wife.</i> These self-demeaning words caused Boaz to lose romantic interest.

                "<b>Conclusion</b><br>However one explains why Boaz and Rut did not marry by the end of <i>perek</i> 2, it seems that at least one of them, if not both, was not ready for marriage at the time. <i>Shir Hashirim</i> expresses no less than three times (2:7, 3:5, and 8:4) “אִם תָּעִירוּ וְאִם תְּעוֹרְרוּ אֶת הָאַהֲבָה עַד שֶׁתֶּחְפָּץ” — love must be expressed only at the appropriate time. Chazal (<i>Brachot</i> 64a) similarly teach that  הדוחק את השעה שעה דוחקתו וכל הנדחה מפני השעה שעה נדחת מפניו — one should not prematurely pursue an opportunity; we must wait for the appropriate time. If we do not, negative consequences will ensue. The Gemara (53b) counsels us to take what appears to be the long road. While it may take a longer time, maintaining a long-term perspective and approach will often yield far better long-term gain."

Yaakov Avinu would have most likely treated Leah Imeinu much better and Shmuel HaNavi would have anointed David HaMelech with much more enthusiasm. Why does the Midrash specifically list the deficiencies of Reuven, Aharon, and Boaz?",

                "The Midrash teaches us to consider these examples and improve on them; since our actions may be written down as well: Eliyahu HaNavi and Mashiach are in the process of recording the actions that trigger their arrival! When we overcome jealousy or irritation, we are tempted to think that even a bit of kindness suffices, considering how difficult it is to show even a small amount of kindness in such a situation. The Midrash teaches us that even in such circumstances we must be “all in.”",
                "As additional motivation, the Midrash explains that our story may be included in the future <i>Sefer HaMashiach V’Eliyahu HaNavi</i>.

As the first step in our effort to grasp this <i>perek</i>, let us try to understand the concept of <i>geulah</i>, as used in our <i>perek</i>. When Rut declared that Boaz was a <i>goel</i>, Boaz replied there was a <i>goel</i> closer in relation. This term is used no less than seven times in the exchange between Rut and Boaz (and its <i>shoresh</i> appears 23 times in <i>Megillat Rut</i>!) But what precisely is a <i>goel</i>?",

According to Ramban, Rut asked Boaz to follow the accepted protocol of “<i>geulah</i>/expanded <i>yibbum,</i>” since he was a close relative of her deceased husband. Boaz responded that this should first be given to the closer relative; the closer the relative, the more “effective” the <i>yibbum</i> and <i>geulah</i>. This is because there is a preference for <i>yibbum </i>to be facilitated by one who is most biologically similar to the deceased husband. According to Ramban, the child born from <i>yibbum</i> is a <i>gilgul </i>(transmigration of the soul) of the man who died without children. Thus, ideally, it should be the brother of the deceased husband that marries the widow. If not him, then the closest relative to the deceased should marry her.",

                "One wonders, though, whether timidity justifies such outrageous behavior. The Torah community today and in generations past would never countenance such behavior. One cannot argue that things were different then, since Torah values are eternal. Thus, Torah values of today should be the same as Torah values in the time of Naomi and Rut. Instead, they should have mustered up the courage to engage Boaz in a conversation about <i>geulah</i>.

                "<b>Approach #2 — Following Lot’s Daughters and Tamar</b><br>A good approach to solving problems when learning Tanach is considering similar or parallel stories, as Tanach should be learned as one big <i>sefer</i> from Hashem.

Many of my <i>talmidim</i> reacted with shock to this possibility. We will devote this section to delving into the fundamental issue of whether it is permissible to criticize the holy <i>tzadikim</i> of Tanach.",
                "<b>May We Criticize Tzadikim of Tanach?</b><br>There is no doubt that <i>tzadikim</i> do sin, as stated twice by Shlomo HaMelech (<i>Melachim I</i> 8:46 and <i>Kohelet</i> 7:20). There are times when Tanach explicitly states that a <i>tzadik</i> has, such as when Moshe hit the rock at Mei Merivah.",
                "What about a situation that the Tanach does not record with criticism from Hashem, but it seems to us that the <i>tzadikim</i> acted wrongly? As a reminder, we have noted that Chazal view Rut and Naomi as <i>tzadikim</i>.",

It seems from <i>Bamidbar perek</i> 11 <i>pesukim</i> 21-23 that Moshe Rabbeinu expressed doubts about Hashem’s capability of providing this amount of meat. Rashi (to <i>pasuk</i> 22) cites the following debate between Rabbi Akiva and Rashbi as to whether Moshe Rabbeinu doubted Hashem’s capabilities:",
                "הצאן ובקר ישחט: זה אחד מארבעה דברים שהיה רבי עקיבא דורש ואין רבי שמעון דורש כמותו. רבי עקיבא אומר שש מאות אלף רגלי, ואתה אמרת בשר אתן להם ואכלו חדש ימים, הצאן ובקר וגו', <b>הכל כמשמעו, מי יספיק להם</b>, כענין שנאמר (ויקרא כה, כו) ומצא כדי גאולתו. ואיזו קשה, זו או (במדבר כ, י) שמעו נא המורים, אלא לפי שלא אמר ברבים חיסך לו הכתוב ולא נפרע ממנו, וזו של מריבה היתה בגלוי, לפיכך לא חיסך לו הכתוב. <b>רבי שמעון אומר חס ושלום לא עלתה על דעתו של אותו צדיק כך</b>, מי שכתוב בו (במדבר יב, ז) בכל ביתי נאמן הוא, יאמר אין המקום מספיק לנו, אלא כך אמר שש מאות אלף רגלי וגו' ואתה אמרת בשר אתן לחדש ימים, ואחר כך תהרוג אומה גדולה כזו, הצאן ובקר ישחט להם כדי שיהרגו, ותהא אכילה זו מספקתן עד עולם, וכי שבחך הוא זה, אומרים לו לחמור טול כור שעורים ונחתוך ראשך. השיבו הקב\"ה ואם לא אתן יאמרו שקצרה ידי, הטוב בעינך שיד ה' תקצר בעיניהם, יאבדו הם ומאה כיוצא בהם ואל תהי ידי קצרה לפניהם אפילו שעה אחת",
                "Rabbi Akiva and Rashbi argue as to whether we should interpret Moshe Rabbeinu’s words in a straightforward manner, and ultimately conclude that he erred, or to make extraordinary efforts to interpret his words in a positive light. Rabbi Akiva believes that Moshe Rabbeinu erred, but according to Rashbi, Moshe Rabbeinu was arguing that Hashem’s punishment was too strict.  This debate may reflect a broader dispute about how we view seemingly inappropriate actions of <i>tzadikim</i>. If so, the propriety of our suggestion that Rut and Naomi erred might hinge on this debate between Rabbi Akiva and Rashbi. It seems that Rashi does not resolve this matter, though he grants Rashbi the last word.",

Perhaps this is a singular situation where it appears unfathomable to Rashbi that our greatest <i>navi</i>, Moshe Rabbeinu, would cast doubt on the extent of Hashem’s capabilities. However, in other circumstances, it is quite possible that Rashbi would be open to criticizing a <i>tzadik</i>.",

                "As we discussed in an earlier section, Ramban (Bereishit 12:10) famously criticizes Avraham Avinu for abandoning Eretz Yisrael and going to Mitzrayim. While other Rishonim disagree (such as Rashi to Bereishit 12:10), the Zohar (<i>Lech Lecha</i> 71b) interestingly agrees with Ramban.",
                "R. Yehuda said: Come and see — because Avraham moved to Egypt without permission, B’nei Yisrael were enslaved in Egypt for four hundred years. For it is written, 'Avraham went down to Egypt,' but not [a command,] 'Go down to Egypt,' and it was for that reason that he was troubled all that night on account of Sarah.”       ",
                "This is quite significant in light of the traditional attribution of the authorship of the Zohar to Rashbi. Rashbi, accordingly, criticizes Avraham Avinu in <i>Bereishit perek</i> 12, but not Moshe Rabbeinu in <i>perek</i> 11. My <i>talmidim</i> argue that this supports the view that Rashbi does not reject all criticism of Tanach’s <i>tzadikim</i>, but rather specifically rejects the idea discussed above, that the greatest <i>navi</i> would doubt Hashem’s capabilities.       ",
                "Likewise, Ramban (Bereishit 16:4) famously criticizes Sarah Imeinu’s treatment of Hagar. While Rabbeinu Chananel (Bereishit 16:5) disagrees with Ramban about this, Radak (Bereishit 16:6) agrees.",
                "<b>David HaMelech — Chazal and Abarbanel</b><br>The Gemara (<i>Shabbat</i> 56a) famously proclaims, “Whoever claims that David HaMelech sinned with Batsheva errs.” This would seem to be a ringing endorsement of the need to go to all lengths to avoid criticizing the <i>tzadikim</i> of Tanach.",
                "However, Abarbanel’s (Shmuel II 11:10) comments on this Gemara show us an alternative approach, in line with those that understand <i>tzadikim </i>to have sinned in their lifetimes:",
                "The teachings of our Sages in this matter are Midrashic explanations, and I will not address them… How can we propose that 'he sought to commit [the transgression] but did not commit it'? The text testifies explicitly to this evil act in its entirety; if David had not sinned, why would he say, 'I have sinned unto God'? And why would he have engaged in such sincere repentance, saying, 'for I know my wrongdoing, and my sin is before me always' (<i>Tehillim</i> 51:5)? Furthermore, the verse that they cite in support of [the approach seeking to exonerate him] – 'And David succeeded in all his ways, and the Lord was with him…' (<i>Shmuel I</i> 18:14) comes prior to this episode, such that it does not rule out the possibility of him sinning afterwards. For even if at that time he was prudent, wise, and successful in all his undertakings, and God was with him in whatever he did, then certainly if he did in fact sin, God would be with him since he accepted his punishment and engaged in repentance. Therefore, my thinking cannot accept a minimizing of David's sin, and I shall not deny the simple truth.”",
                "Significantly, Abarbanel does not argue with the Gemara. He explains that the Gemara is speaking the language of <i>derash</i> while he is speaking the language of <i>peshat</i>. We suggest that Chazal, (in the <i>derech</i> of <i>derash</i>) are saying that David HaMelech did not, technically speaking, sin. Rather, he was a <i>naval bi’reshut haTorah</i> (see Ramban to <i>Vayikra</i> 19:2), as although he acted terribly, he managed to avoid any technical Torah prohibitions. David HaMelech’s severe punishment, the Gemara might be teaching, for violating what is “merely” a <i>naval bi’reshut haTorah</i> violation, communicates the severity of this type of sin.",
                "<b>Criticism Taken Too Far?</b><br>Some contemporary teachers take this idea too far and criticize <i>tzadikim</i> of Tanach unnecessarily without precedent in Chazal, Rishonim or Acharonim. Rabbi Aharon Lichtenstein, in an address to graduates of Yeshivat Har Etzion, rejected the argument that Yaakov Avinu taking the <i>bechorah</i> from Eisav was improper. Rabbi Lichtenstein noted that Ramban, who did not shy from criticizing the <i>avot</i>, did not criticize Yaakov Avinu for taking that which was rightfully his, and therefore neither should we. I am unaware of any Rishonim or Acharonim who criticize Yaakov Avinu for taking the <i>bechorah</i>.",
                "A number of TABC <i>talmidim</i> do note the troubling nature of Rivka Imeinu and Yaakov Avinu’s behavior in this incident. This matter does merit serious thought and in-depth exploration. I do not mean to stifle creativity, and of course not every issue has been resolved in prior generations (as stated explicitly in <i>Chulin</i> 7a). However, when it comes to the ultra-sensitive issue of criticizing <i>tzadikim </i>of Tanach, we should exercise great caution.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The approach to the Yaakov/Eisav/Rivka/Yitzchak situation that is set forth by Rabbi Elchanan Samet in his <i>Iyunim B’farshi’ot HaShavua</i> seems to succeed in being both compelling and in harmony with Chazal, Rishonim and Acharonim.</i>",
                "<b>Returning to Naomi and Rut</b><br>While there is room to criticize the <i>tzadikim</i> of Tanach even without explicit criticism from Hashem, there should be some basis for such criticism in Chazal, Rishonim or Acharonim. Perhaps we should be stricter and require a source in Chazal for our criticism of Rut and Naomi.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the suggestion of TABC <i>talmid</i> Eitan Mermelstein.</i>",
                "There is a challenge due to the paucity of classic Rishonim on Rut — there is no commentary by Radak, Ralbag, Abarbanel or Metzudot. There are, however, a rich array of Midrashim, which is why we cited three Midrashim that might support our contention. Even so, we couched this assertion with considerable caution.",
                "<b>Conclusion — Imperfect Tzadikim: A Mark of the Authenticity of the Torah</b><br>Let us conclude with some sources that express a positive side of saying that our <i>tzadikim</i> did indeed sin.",
                "<b>Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch (to Bereishit 12:10-13)</b><br>\"The Torah never presents our great men as being perfect… The Torah never hides from us the faults, errors and weaknesses of our great men. Just by that it gives the stamp of veracity to what it relates. But in truth, by the knowledge which is given us of their faults and weaknesses, our great men are in no wise made lesser but actually greater and more instructive. If they stood before us as the purest models of perfection we should attribute them as having a different nature, which has been denied to us… It may never be our task to whitewash the spiritual and moral heroes of our past, to appear as apologists for them. Truth is the seal of our Torah, and truthfulness is the principle of all its true and great commentators and teachers.\"",
                "<i><b>Bereishit Rabbah</b></i><b> 87:10<i></i></b><i><br></i>",
                "A Roman matron asked Rabbi Yossi: Is it possible that Yosef, at the age of 17, at the height of physical maturity, would have acted in this way? Rabbi Yossi brought out the book of<i> Bereishit</i> and began to read the stories of Reuven and Yehuda. He said to her, if with regard to these two, who were older than he and were in their father's house, the text makes no effort to cover up their deeds, then concerning Yosef, who was younger than they and was all alone – how much more credence is thereby bestowed on this account.",
                "Accordingly, limited criticism of Tanach’s <i>tzadikim</i> need not be seen as belittling them. Rather, the fact that the Tanach does not hide their misdeeds highlights the authenticity of their great actions recorded by Tanach."

Rashi to <i>pasuk</i> 6 explains that there is a discrepancy; while Naomi asked Rut to prepare for her meeting <i>before</i> she walks to Boaz’s granary, Rut waited to do so until she had reached the granary. In this way, she avoided generating suspicion of unseemly behavior while she walked to the granary.",
                "Consider the import of this insight. This communicates that Rut had improved and learned the Jewish way of <i>tzniut</i> during the months she had spent with Boaz’s female workers. In addition, it demonstrates that Rut was not acting like a robot, blindly obeying Naomi’s directives. Instead, she was also thinking for herself and making deliberate choices. Rut’s confidence in making decisions independent of Naomi reflects Rut’s improved self-esteem, correcting her earlier slip in self-esteem in her conversation with Boaz.",
                "<b>A Difficult Time Period</b><br>Rashi to <i>pasuk</i> 2 (s.v. <i>“Ha’layla”)</i> explains that Boaz slept in the granary due to concern that people would steal his grain. Rashi’s insight fits with Chazal’s understanding of <i>Megillat Rut</i>’s introductory words, <i>“Vayehi bi’yemei shefot ha’shofetim,”</i> as referring to a time of rampant corruption. It also fits with <i>perek</i> 2 <i>pesukim</i> 9 and 22, which describe the necessity for Boaz to admonish the men not to harass the female workers in the field. Boaz had to emphasize that the low standards of his time were not acceptable in his domain.",
                "We should note, though, that the image of Boaz sleeping in the granary guarding his grain hardly seems to fit with <i>Rut Rabbah’s</i> assertion that Boaz was 80 years old at this time. More on this in a later section.",
                "<b>Reaffirming Rut’s Conversion</b><br>Rashi to <i>pasuk</i> 3 (s.v. <i>“V’rachatzt</i>” and s.v. “<i>V’sacht</i>”) explains that Naomi was directing Rut to remove any stain of <i>avodah zarah</i> and reaffirm her commitment to the mitzvot, as she was about to boldly approach Boaz. This comment seems to be a deeply meaningful point in the broader context of this <i>perek</i>. Perhaps the message is that the bold action that Rut was about to take did not represent a regression to Moabite ways; rather, in Naomi and Rut’s mind they were acting completely in conformity to Torah laws and values.",
                "<b>The Joy and Impact of Torah Learning</b><br>Rashi to <i>pasuk</i> 7 (s.v. “<i>Vayitav Libo</i>”) makes an extraordinarily beautiful comment. Instead of interpreting Boaz “<i>Vayitav Libo</i> — and he gladdened his heart” as inebriating himself, Rashi understands it as Baoz taking some time to study Torah. This comment has significant implications.",
                "First, by describing Torah learning as gladdening of the heart, Rashi captures the essence of <i>talmud Torah</i>. The Sochatchover Rebbe, in his introduction to his <i>sefer Eglei Tal</i>, teaches that the essence of <i>talmud Torah</i> is to enjoy the learning — עיקר מצות לימוד התורה להיות שש ושמח ומתענג בלימודו. This assertion fits perfectly with the <i>beracha</i> we recite each morning, asking Hashem to help us enjoy our Torah learning —  הַעֲרֵב נָא, ה' אֱלֹהֵינוּ, אֶת דִּבְרֵי תוֹרָתְךָ בְּפִינוּ וּבְפִי כָל עַמְּךָ בֵּית יִשְׂרָאֵל. It also fits with the Halacha that forbids learning Torah during mourning periods, such as Tisha B’Av (<i>Ta’anit</i> 30a). Torah learning is too enjoyable for a period of <i>aveilut</i> (mourning).",
                "The image of Boaz taking time to learn after a long hard day in the field, and describing it as gladdening his heart, captures the joy of Torah learning. The joy of life comes from transcending the mundane and elevating ourselves by entering the world of Torah.",
                "There is a dramatic difference between those who seek to “transcend” the mundane and gladden their heart by imbibing alcohol after a long day of work and those who do so by means of Torah study. Rashi captures this contrast by eschewing the expected explanation of “<i>vayitav libo” </i>as<i> </i>drinking, and instead explaining it as studying Torah. Indulging in alcohol as a pursuit of joy is often self-destructive, whereas delving into Torah is a life-affirming and edifying pursuit.",
                "Finally, Boaz studying Torah before Rut enters the granary fortifies Boaz for the great <i>nisayon</i> that he was about to face. The Torah study that plugs Boaz into the fount of eternity allows him to choose eternity over the fleeting pleasures of this world, which do not serve his best long-term interest.",

Most notably, this is the source for the Sephardic and German Jewish custom for a <i>chatan</i> to don his <i>tallit</i> under the <i>chuppah</i> and spread it over the <i>kallah</i>. Rut’s words, as explained by Rashi, live on in Jewish life.",
                "<b>Boaz’s Oath</b><br>The <i>peshat</i> and <i>derash</i> explanations presented by Rashi to <i>pasuk</i> 13 s.v. “<i>Chai Hashem</i>” fit with our idea that <i>peshat</i> sometimes refers to what people say and <i>derash</i> to what people think.",
                "The <i>peshat</i> explains that Rut challenged Boaz to prove his seriousness. This demonstrates how Rut had come out of her proverbial shell, very assertively confronting Boaz and assuring the redemption. This <i>peshat</i> explanation fills in the missing piece of the story, explaining what prompts Boaz to take an oath.",
                "On the <i>derash</i> level, Boaz fortified himself by swearing to transcend his biological urges and act in conformity with the transcendent values of Hashem and His Torah (i.e., restrain himself until marriage). These two levels of interpretation capture the two levels of struggle in which Boaz was found.",
                "<b>Conclusion</b><br>Each comment of Rashi, which usually emerges from the teachings of the Midrash, is laden with deep meaning. Our job is to think deeply and do our utmost to reveal and uncover the profound and enriching lessons waiting to be discovered."

Perhaps <i>Megillat Rut</i> is intentionally using this phrase in order to compare Boaz’s learning to drinking alcohol. Boaz’s Torah learning was done in a constructive way for the same purpose that the alcohol devotee uses his drink in a destructive way: as a means to transcend his daily life.",
                "The fundamental difference, however, is that alcohol consumption leads one to lose control of his emotions and make decisions that he will severely regret in the long run, as in the case of Achashveirosh.

Yehuda thought that Tamar was a <i>zonah</i>, “because he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law.” Yehuda did not bother to inquire as to the identity of the woman he encountered. Likewise with Lot, in his infamous drunken encounter with his daughters. Boaz, unlike Yehuda and Lot, treated Rut and himself with respect. He controlled his emotions, unlike Yehuda, Lot and Achashveirosh, whose emotions seemed to control them, thereby creating a <i>tikkun </i>for Yehuda and Lot’s mistakes.",

Boaz serves as a potent example of how our Torah learning can and must elevate us to highest and most beautiful, ethical behavior, both in regards to <i>bein adam le’chaveiro</i>, respecting people, as well as <i>bein adam la’makom</i>, respecting Hashem.",
                "<b>Postscript – Beautiful Words from TABC Talmid Yitzi Weiss</b><br>Why was Boaz a <i>gadol ha’dor</i>, a <i>tzadik</i>, and a <i>chasid</i>?",
                "It is not so impressive for one to be a good person when everything in life is going well. When a person is blessed with a beautiful, fully-functioning family, a healthy marriage and financial success, it does not seem so significant for that person to treat Hashem and others well — it’s pretty much expected of them. Of course, we can say that there is a challenge that he should not say “<i>kochi ve’otzem yadi</i>,” my success is owed to myself, and he should instead recognize Hashem — but, nonetheless, these challenges are minimal.",
                "However, a person’s character is put to the test when they are placed in a tough situation. For instance, when B’nei Yisrael were faced with the Yam Suf in front of them and the Egyptian army behind them, they immediately began to complain. The same happened when they were thirsty for water, and the list goes on. These same people beautifully sang <i>Az Yashir</i>, a song of praise to Hashem, when the sea split for them.",
                "Most people act appropriately when life is running smoothly. What defines a person is the way in which they deal with hard times. B’nei Yisrael was a nascent nation with a long way to go when they left Egypt, and this reality was quite evident in the way they responded to the challenge they faced. Alternatively, when a person can accept the challenging times, and, instead of folding, remain principled and retain fidelity to one’s principles, this is a true testament to the stability of one’s character.",
                "This time of Boaz’s life was not easy. He had recently lost his wife, and at the time of these events he was worried about his livelihood, cautious of intruders who may steal from him. Despite these circumstances, Boaz did not fall blind to instinct. He composed himself and reverts to his core principle — <i>emunah</i> in Hashem. Boaz opens a <i>sefer</i> and sits down to learn. Through this peaceful internal encounter, his worry and loneliness was relieved. At last, his heart felt “good;” he repaired his wounds by letting Hashem in.",
                "In this way, Boaz achieved a level of a <i>chasid</i> and a <i>tzadik</i>. His character had been tested in a difficult time and he prevailed. He understood that, in a tough time, all we can do is reach out to Hashem or to a friend and let them in. All we can do is address the situation at hand in a healthy and productive way. This character trait, the ability to adhere to our principles and think clearly in a tough time, is my humble understanding of what it means to achieve the status of a <i>chasid</i> and a <i>tzadik</i>.",
                "The exact opposite is exhibited through the actions of Achashveirosh. His response to his insecurities was to drink. This unhealthy and counterproductive response is that of someone whose character is uncivilized. Achashveirosh was like someone who fails to understand that one cannot treat a deep, infected cut with a bandage, primarily because they are too afraid to see what is underneath it. The decision he made while under the influence was to have his wife Vashti killed, again dealing with his insecurity by putting a bandage over the wound, rather than addressing the real problems in his life.",
                "Finally, Boaz achieves something otherworldly. After finally falling asleep through the noise of his troubles, Boaz was frightened in the middle of the night to find an intruder at his feet. However, rather than reacting in the way we all likely would have, Boaz composed himself and then asked who she was. Immediately after, he praised her. This encounter is otherworldly. The character displayed within these lines is the most sharpened there is.",
                "Being scared represents an instinct. One cannot make a calculated decision in a moment like this. When one is scared, his truest nature is revealed. Boaz’s response to Rut reveals his essence — but he was not born like this. Boaz developed himself through his Torah learning until he could defy his natural instinct and had transformed his being to the extent that he had changed his nature. This level is where he earned the description as a <i>tzadik</i> and <i>chasid</i>.",
                "A <i>rebbe</i> from Aish HaTorah once explained that “we are placed into this world as a homo sapien and it is our job that we leave a refined human being.”",
                "We are all imperfect. We all have a great deal to accomplish. If we develop ourselves the way that Boaz did, our natural instinct can be overridden by the strong backbone of principles."

There also are two rare words that are <i>kri v’lo ktiv</i>, and a rare <i>ktiv v’lo kri</i>. What are we to make of these unusual phenomena?",
                "There are a variety of explanations for <i>kri u’chtiv</i> that vary from place to place in Tanach. It is clear, however, that sometimes both the <i>kri</i> and the <i>ktiv</i> capture different meanings of the word.",
                "<b>Kri U’chtiv in Perek 3 — Rashi</b><br>Rashi comments on the <i>kri u’chtiv</i> of the word “<i>ve’yaradet”</i> in <i>Rut perek</i> 3 <i>pasuk</i> 3. Rashi understands the <i>ktiv</i> “וירדתי” to mean that Naomi told Rut: my <i>zechut</i>, merit, will be with you.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">TABC <i>talmid</i> Levi Langer asks, what <i>zechut </i>did Naomi have? She left Eretz Yisrael with her family, and her children married out of the Jewish nation. We respond that Naomi retained her Jewish identity in Moav and returned to Beit Lechem despite the immense difficulty. Recall the previously mentioned Midrash that Naomi walked barefoot from Moav to Eretz Yisrael! Levi responds, did Naomi not think she had merits, as evidenced by her bitter words recorded in the end of <i>perek</i> 1? We respond that Naomi's self-image has improved by this point. Her bold plan for Rut in the granary indicates a renewed confidence.</i> Rashi views the <i>ktiv</i> as a <i>derash</i>, the harmony to the melody of the <i>kri</i>.",
                "According to Rashi and Chazal, Naomi encouraged Rut.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">TABC <i>talmid</i> Ephraim Helfgot notes that Naomi telling Rut that she will be with her is a way for Naomi to reciprocate what Rut told her in <i>perek</i> 1: כִּי אֶל-אֲשֶׁר תֵּלְכִי אֵלֵךְ, וּבַאֲשֶׁר תָּלִינִי אָלִין--עַמֵּךְ עַמִּי, I will go where you go and I sleep where you sleep.</i> There are multiple reasons why this encouragement was needed. First, her plan was fraught with risks. If Rut were to be caught, her reputation would be permanently sullied. Even if she would not be caught, how would Boaz react to her bold intrusion into his granary? Finally, maybe in the eyes of Hashem this plan was way off base.",
                "Rashi’s understanding of the <i>ktiv</i> is reminiscent of Rivka telling Yaakov Avinu, before he executes her plan to dress as Eisav, that she will bear Yitzchak’s potential curse (Bereishit 27:13). Perhaps Naomi reassured Rut that her <i>zechut</i> is with Rut, to spare Rut from Hashem’s punishment should there be one. Naomi took responsibility, much like Rivka did for Yaakov’s deception.",
                "A possible shortcoming of this approach is that it does not account for the <i>kri u’chtiv</i> in <i>perek</i> 3 <i>pasuk</i> 4 of “ושכבתי / וְשָׁכָבְתְּ” — “and you will sleep” or “and I will sleep.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">TABC <i>talmid</i> Mikey Schwartz responds that Naomi also reassured Rut with ושכבתי — that her <i>zechut</i> would be with Rut then as well. </i>",
                "<b>A Peshat Variation on Rashi</b><br>We offer a variation of Rashi and Chazal that uses the <i>peshat</i>-<i>derash</i> model of interpreting this “וירדתי” <i>kri u’chtiv</i> that also accounts for ושכבתי / וְשָׁכָבְתְּ. Our view explains both cases of <i>kri u’chtiv and</i> is based on the model that <i>peshat</i> is what one says, while <i>derash</i> is what one thinks (either consciously or subconsciously).",
                "We suggest that וְשָׁכָבְתְּ is what Naomi said but ושכבתי is what she thought, perhaps subconsciously. Why would Naomi be thinking ושכבתי? Here are a few possibilities:",
                "Naomi was in need of <i>yibbum</i> as well, since Elimelech’s sons had died and there were no longer any children of his to continue his legacy. Of course, this was not <i>yibbum</i> in the pure Halachic sense, since <i>yibbum</i> is specifically when the deceased husband’s brother marries the widow, but may be viewed as quasi-<i>yibbum</i> or <i>geulah</i> as understood by the Ramban. However, Naomi is not of childbearing age, as indicated in Rut 1:12.",
                "Interestingly, Rut 4:17 states “יֻלַּד-בֵּן לְנָעֳמִי  — a child is born to Naomi” when a son was born to Rut and Boaz. It seems that Rut’s childbirth was fulfilling not only Machlon’s legacy and <i>yibbum,</i> but also that of Naomi and Elimelech.",
                "<b>Other Peshat Variations</b><br>Many times, a rabbi will offer a controversial <i>psak</i> in a pressing situation (<i>sha’at had’chak</i>) and the questioner will ask, “but would you do this, rabbi, if you were in my situation?” Perhaps the use of the <i>ktiv </i>word “<i>ve’shachavti</i>” reflects Naomi reassuring Rut — I would also do this, if I were of age.",
                "Another idea is that this might be similar to Ramban’s explanation of Hashem’s instructions (<i>Shemot</i> 25:10) to Moshe Rabbeinu וְעָשׂוּ אֲרוֹן (“and you (plural) shall make an Ark” when ultimately only one person, Betzalel, made the <i>aron</i>. Ramban offers many explanations and concludes with the possibility that שיכוונו לדבר — which I understand as saying, if all of Am Yisrael has <i>kavana</i>, intent, to construct the <i>aron,</i> it is as if they are all building it. Since everyone was emotionally invested in building the <i>aron</i>, everyone, in a sense, helped Betzalel in building the <i>aron</i>.",
                "The <i>ktiv</i> in Rut 3:3 and 3:4 might convey a similar idea. Naomi told Rut that she was emotionally invested in Rut’s success, making this approach similar to that of Rashi and Chazal’s explanation of וירדתי/וירדת.  The <i>ktiv</i> conveys that Naomi was telling Rut that it was as if Naomi was going to the granary with her, since Naomi felt so invested in Rut’s success.",
                "<b>Kri V’lo Ktiv</b><br>Now let us try to explain the striking <i>kri v’lo ktiv</i> in Rut 3:5.

                "Related to the distinction between <i>peshat </i>and <i>derash </i>discussed previously, we suggest that, similarly, the <i>kri</i> is what one says and the <i>ktiv</i> (or lack thereof) is what one thinks.",

Long term success comes to those who serve others, and failure comes to the self-centered.",
                "In the <i>kri v’lo ktiv</i> of Rut 3:5, the <i>ktiv</i> communicates that Rut removed herself from the picture, since her attitude was that she was to serve Boaz and Naomi and not herself. Rut’s ultimate reward is that she becomes the <i>Ima Shel Malchut</i>, the founding mother of the royal family, as expressed by the gemara in Bava Batra 91a.",
                "Rut eschewing self-centered behavior contrasts starkly with Chazal’s understanding of Elimelech’s name — וְשֵׁם הָאִישׁ אֱלִימֶלֶךְ, שֶׁהָיָה אוֹמֵר אֵלַי תָבוֹא מַלְכוּת, that he felt entitled to the throne (Rut Rabbah 2:5). In the end, the self-centered Elimelech died prematurely and Rut becomes <i>Ima Shel Malchut</i>.",

Naomi looked out for Rut’s best interest (Rut 3:1) and Rut reciprocated by putting Naomi’s interest ahead of hers (Rut 3:5).",
                "This approach can explain the <i>kri v’lo ktiv</i> in Rut 3:17, the omission (in the <i>ktiv</i>) of the word “<i>eilay</i> — to me.” Perhaps this <i>kri</i> expresses that Rut, in reporting Boaz’s message, removed herself from the discussion since she was focused on helping others.",
                "<b>Ktiv V’Lo Kri</b><br>Finally, let us try to explain the <i>ktiv v’lo kri</i> in <i>Rut perek </i>3 <i>pasuk </i>12. In this case, the word “<i>im</i> — if” (as in, <i>if</i> I am a <i>goel</i>) is written but not read. We suggest that the <i>kri</i> is what is said while the <i>ktiv</i> is what is thought.",
                "The word “<i>im</i>” expresses hesitation. Boaz’s ambivalence might fit with the suggestion that Boaz was hesitant to enter this relationship since he was still grieving over the loss of his wife (or perhaps for other reasons — the considerable age gap<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to <i>Rut Rabbah</i>, Boaz was eighty years old, and Rut was forty years old.</i> between himself and Rut, or Rut being a Moabite).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the suggestion of TABC <i>talmid </i>Akiva Prager.</i>",
                "Alternatively, as noted by Rashi, the <i>kri</i> expresses the certainty that there was a closer relative. The <i>ktiv </i>expresses that Boaz was very eager to marry Rut and, subconsciously or consciously, relegated the closer <i>goel</i> to doubtful status in the hope that he would be able to marry her.",
                "<b>Conclusion — Insight from TABC Talmid Michael Schwartz</b><br>The abundance of <i>kri u’chtiv</i> in <i>Rut perek</i> 3 is not a coincidence. The actions described in this <i>perek</i> can easily be seen as inappropriate. Perhaps the many instances of <i>kri u’chtiv</i> are here to emphasize that the characters in the story did nothing wrong. While the <i>kri</i> alone might convey a sense of inappropriate behavior, the <i>ktiv</i> clarifies that the characters seek to distance themselves from wrongdoing. According to the <i>ktiv</i>, Naomi spoke about herself going rather than Rut, Rut removed herself from the story, and Boaz spoke with uncertainty. The <i>ktiv</i> can be seen as the characters protecting themselves from impropriety."

                "Why did Boaz not send Rut home immediately, instead allowing her to sleep at his feet (<i>pasuk</i> 14, וַתִּשְׁכַּב מַרְגְּלוֹתָו)? Considering the prohibition of <i>yichud</i>, at the very least, Boaz and Rut should have slept on opposite sides of the granary, with some kind of partition between themselves. As mentioned earlier, Chazal understood that Boaz found Rut attractive. Why, then, did Boaz not exercise caution, and instead place himself in a <i>nisayon</i> (trial)? Every day during <i>shacharit</i>, we ask Hashem not to place us into a <i>nisayon</i> ואל תביאני לא לידי חטא ולא לידי עון, ולא לידי נסיון, ולא לידי בזיון (<i>Brachot</i> 60b).",
                "Perhaps, as my <i>talmidim</i> suggest, it would have been unspeakably cruel for Boaz to dispatch Rut into the night of Beit Lechem. This was a time of disorder and corruption, and asking an attractive woman to walk home alone at night in such an environment would be placing Rut in serious danger.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chazal (Rut Rabbah 7:3) teach that even during the day, Boaz accompanied Rut on her return to Naomi, lest she be attacked by one of the many ruffians rampant in that society.</i> It could be that even asking Rut to sleep on the other side of the granary was unsafe, as Rashi (Rut 3:2 s.v. “<i>Halaylah”</i>) notes that Boaz slept in the granary to guard it from theft.",
                "However, there seems to be even more at stake here than safety, namely, Rut’s dignity. Even asking her to sleep on the other side of the granary might have seemed like Boaz was not protecting her, rejecting her and pushing her away on her own. This would have been humiliating to Rut, especially considering her request of Boaz.",
                "We suggest an answer based on the Gemara (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 21) that states that only after the Tamar and Amnon disaster (see <i>Shmuel II perek</i> 13), five generations after Boaz and Rut, was <i>yichud</i> between singles prohibited. Since <i>yichud</i> between single men and women at this point was not technically forbidden (but nonetheless seen as reprehensible), Boaz permitted Rut to sleep at his feet given the circumstances. Additionally, perhaps since Boaz was interested in marrying Rut, he feared that acting in an insensitive manner would sabotage their relationship.",
                "Rashi to <i>pasuk</i> 13 s.v. “<i>Chai Hashem</i>” captures the great tension and very delicate balance that Boaz had to strike in the granary that evening. According to Rashi, Boaz swore fidelity to both Hashem and Rut. He struggled to strike a proper balance of kindness to Rut, a convert and widow, and fidelity to Hashem. Permitting Rut to sleep at his feet while refraining from relations was the very tricky balance Boaz struck that night when the challenge of his life was hurled at him without warning. Boaz does his best to honor his responsibilities to both Rut and Hashem, as he swears to Rut that he will expediently tend to this matter and swears to Hashem that he will not sin with Rut.",

                "To whom does Boaz say this — to Rut, to himself, or to someone else?

Why, according to Rashi, did Boaz make such a self-centered comment?",
                "Before we try to explain Rashi’s approach, let us note the contrasting approach of the Midrash (<i>Rut Rabbah </i>7:1) וַיֹּאמֶר אַל יִוָּדַע כִּי בָאָה הָאִשָּׁה הַגֹּרֶן, לְמִי אָמַר, אָמַר רַבִּי מֵאִיר לְבֶן בֵּיתוֹ. רַבִּי חוּנְיָא וְרַבִּי יִרְמְיָה בְּשֵׁם רַבִּי שְׁמוּאֵל בַּר רַב יִצְחָק, כָּל אוֹתוֹ הַלַּיְלָה הָיָה בֹּעַז שָׁטוּחַ עַל פָּנָיו וְאוֹמֵר, רִבּוֹן הָעוֹלָמִים גָּלוּי וְיָדוּעַ לְפָנֶיךָ שֶׁלֹא נָגַעְתִּי בָּהּ, כֵּן יְהִי רָצוֹן מִלְּפָנֶיךָ אַל יִוָּדַע כִּי בָאָה הָאִשָּׁה הַגֹּרֶן, וְלֹא יִתְחַלֵּל בִּי שֵׁם שָׁמַיִם.

Boaz was more concerned for the <i>chilul Hashem</i> than he was for his own reputation.",
                "Rashi, though, notes that before one helps another, he must first tend to his own needs. Indeed, Rabbi Akiva famously teaches, חייך קודמים לחיי חבירך — your life precedes the life of another (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 62a). Similarly, airplane safety protocol calls for a parent to affix an oxygen mask on his own face before placing one on his child.",
                "As discussed previously, Rashi to <i>pasuk</i> 13 s.v. “<i>Chai Hashem</i>” describes the balance that Boaz had to strike, between caring for his own needs and the needs of Rut. Boaz was concerned for Hashem, as well as both his and Rut’s needs. While there is value in prioritizing one’s own needs, it must be balanced with consideration of Hashem’s will and others’ needs, as Boaz succeeded in doing.",
                "<b>Food for Naomi</b><br>In<i> perek</i> 3 <i>pasuk</i> 17, Rut reported that Boaz sent food for Naomi. This was the sole instance in <i>Megillat Rut</i> of connection between Boaz and Naomi.",

How might we resolve this difference?",
                "Da’at Mikra offers two solutions. One is that Boaz did indeed say it, but there was no need for the Tanach to record it since it was written in <i>pasuk</i> 17. Alternatively, Rut figured it out on her own, based on the amount of food that was given (in line with Malbim’s approach, which we will soon discuss).",
                "There is also an interesting suggestion that Rut made up these words in order to effect <i>shalom</i> between Boaz and Naomi. Aharon HaKohen is said by <i>chazal</i> to have used this type of methodology to create peace between people at odds with each other (<i>Avot D’Rabbi Natan</i> 12:3). The fact that Boaz did not extend help to Naomi upon her return to Beit Lechem, and that Naomi did not approach Boaz for help or even instruct Rut to glean in Boaz’s field, indicates strain between these two relatives.",
                "There also seemed to be a serious need to mend the relationship between Naomi and Boaz, since they were about to become more deeply connected through Rut’s upcoming marriage to Boaz. However, this explanation does not seem to stand when considering that Boaz expressed appreciation to Rut for her kindness to Naomi (2:11), and Naomi wholeheartedly blessed Boaz (2:20). Nevertheless, perhaps some lingering tension (whether conscious or subconscious) prevailed, because Naomi had left Beit Lechem in times of trouble, even though Naomi and Boaz expressed concern for each other.",

                "Malbim to <i>pesukim</i> 15–18 explains that the six pieces of barley were enough for breakfast for both Naomi and Rut. Naomi understood that Boaz was communicating that they did not need to worry beyond breakfast, for all would be resolved before the next meal. Furthermore, the Midrash (Rut Rabbah 7:6) tells us that Naomi knew that Boaz was man of his word, as is proper conduct befitting a righteous Jew:",

In <i>pasuk</i> 4, \"וְהוּא יַגִּיד לָךְ, אֵת אֲשֶׁר תַּעֲשִֽׂין — and he will instruct you what to do,” Naomi anticipated Boaz’s reaction to Rut’s bold move. In <i>pasuk</i> 18, Naomi realized that, based on Rut’s report, she had anticipated correctly, and Boaz was motivated both by his <i>yetzer tov</i> (kind impulse) and <i>yetzer hara</i> (pleasure impulse) to move very quickly. Rashi (Devarim 6:5) teaches that we are to serve Hashem with both the <i>yetzer tov</i> and <i>yetzer hara,</i> בכל לבבך: בשני יצריך. Naomi knew that Boaz was a principled man, dedicated to proper interactions between himself and Hashem, as well as between himself and others.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This approach also explains why Naomi sent Rut to Boaz and not to the <i>goel</i> who was first in line for the <i>geulah</i>. Naomi recognized her relative’s character, and correctly anticipated that Boaz will assume responsibility, as opposed to the <i>goel</i>. There are other possible answers — for example, according to the Targum to Rut 4:6, unlike Boaz, the <i>goel</i> was married. </i> She also recognized, as she had anticipated as well, that Boaz was attracted to Rut and wished to proceed expeditiously.",
                "My <i>talmidim </i>suggest another answer based on the Lubavitcher Rebbe’s motto, “Think good and it will be good.” When you have done everything that you could have done, and the matter is entirely beyond one’s control, the proper mindset indeed is to “think good and it will be good.” Chasidut teaches us that the <i>bitachon</i>, trust, that one places in Hashem, saying that everything will work out well, itself has the power and potential to generate a positive result. David HaMelech (<i>Tehillim</i> 55:23) similarly teaches us that we should cast our concerns to Hashem, and Hashem will in turn support us: השלך על ה' יהבך והוא יכלכלך לא יתן לעולם מוט לצדיק. Thus, Naomi advised Rut in the closing <i>pasuk</i> of <i>perek</i> 3 to rest quietly and trust in Hashem, that He would help Boaz to promptly resolve all in her favor. The silence that ensues indicates that Rut complied, thought “good,” and — lo and behold — all turned out for the good!",
                "<b>Conclusion</b><br>One must know how to distinguish when it is time to act from when it is time to refrain from acting and instead place our trust in Hashem. Naomi guided Rut in taking bold steps to establish her future and the future of her family. Naomi also guided Rut in knowing when to “sit tight” and trust that Hashem will guide matters towards the desired result.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Midrash (<i>Rut Rabbah </i>7:7) notes that Hashem saw that Boaz, Naomi and Rut all did what they could to resolve their situation, and only then did Hashem intervene and contribute to the redemption of Rut and her family. Rut and Naomi’s positive thinking might be included in Hashem saying, “Naomi and Rut did their part.”</i>"

                "<b>זִּקְנֵי הָעִיר עֲשָׂרָה</b><br>In <i>pasuk 2,</i> Boaz convened an assembly of ten of the “<i>ziknei ha’ir</i>.” While we often translate this as city elders, <i>ziknei ha’ir </i>extends to <i>talmidei chachamim,</i> as stated by Rashi to <i>Vayikra</i> 19:32. According to the Targum, it makes sense to assume that these elders were members of the Sanhedrin<i>.</i>",
                "Many note the peculiarity of the number ten in regards to this assemblage of distinguished leaders, which at first glance seems to be a <i>beit din</i>. As the first Mishna in <i>Masechet Sanhedrin</i> teaches, a <i>beit din</i> consists of either 3, 23 or 71 <i>dayanim</i>. Moreover, a <i>beit din</i> is never composed of an even number— אין בית דין שקול — as stated repeatedly in <i>Sanhedrin</i>. Thus, we must ask why Boaz assembled specifically ten elders for this supposed “<i>beit din.”</i>",
                "We suggest that the issues of redeeming Elimelech’s land and marrying Rut are not ones of <i>din</i>, strict Halacha. Rather, these issues are what Chazal call <i>lifnim mishurat ha’din</i> — going beyond the letter of the law, as well as <i>minhag ha’medinah</i> — common custom.",
                "To clarify, no violation of the Halacha occurred in this situation. Ten members of the Sanhedrin would never tolerate such a violation! Rather, in this <i>perek,</i> Boaz exceeded Halachic expectations by satisfying not only the letter of the Halacha but also the spirit of the Halacha.",
                "For example, let’s consider whether Rut was truly a candidate for <i>yibbum</i> or <i>geulah</i>. Recall that Malbim (Rut 1:4) insists that Rut did not convert before marrying Machlon. Rather, Rut converted only upon her return to Beit Lechem with Naomi. Strictly speaking, Boaz had no Halachic obligations to Rut as the widow of Machlon; Rut was not the Halachic widow of Machlon, as she was not considered Halachically married to Machlon, as it occurred before her conversion.",
                "Moreover, the notion of <i>geulah</i> in <i>Megillat Rut</i> is a <i>lifnim mishurat ha’din</i>  — a customary extension of <i>yibbum</i>, according to Ramban. <i>Geulah</i> exceeds the demands of the letter of the law by expanding the obligation of <i>yibbum</i> beyond the brothers of the deceased husband.",
                "Therefore, we suggest that Boaz assembled ten of the <i>ziknei ha’ir</i>, which was not a number for a proper <i>beit din</i>, because <i>din</i> — formal baseline Halacha — was not being considered. Boaz was indeed acting fully in compliance with baseline Halacha, but his intention was not only to comply with the baseline but to exceed its requirements.",
                "Why, then, did Boaz assemble <i>ziknei ha’ir </i>at all? Boaz could have met with the <i>goel </i>in private, since a <i>beit din</i> was not required.",
                "We suggest two reasons for the assemblage of ten men. First, the Gemara (<i>Ketubot</i> 7b) derives from Boaz’s assembly of ten men that a <i>minyan</i> is required for <i>birkat chatanim</i>, wedding blessings. This teaches that marriage is not only a private matter between the <i>chatan</i> and <i>kallah</i>, but rather, it is a public matter as well. Unlike non-Jewish couples who retreat to a private honeymoon immediately after the wedding, Jews have a week of public celebrations — <i>sheva berachot</i> — because marriage is seen also a communal matter.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">TABC <i>talmid</i> Natan Rifkind notes that the Halachic requirement of <i>panim chadashot</i> for <i>sheva berachot</i> (fresh faces, i.e. people not present at the wedding or a prior <i>sheva berachot</i>) also emphasizes the communal aspect of marriage, since even more people are involved in the celebrations. </i> This, I believe, explains why Boaz assembled ten people; his marriage to Rut was a public matter and required a public assembly.",
                "Still, why did Boaz specifically gather ten <i>ziknei ha’ir</i>, if any ten people could have played this role? I suggest that since Boaz was about to engage in highly unconventional approaches (as we shall discuss in upcoming chapters) to address an unprecedented situation, he seeks the unanimous approval of numerous <i>ziknei ha’ir. To</i> give a modern-day example, before ArtScroll printed English translations of the Gemara, the company obtained the unanimous consent of multiple <i>gedolei Yisrael</i>. Boaz similarly sought unanimous approval of ten of the city’s Torah scholars for his unprecedented actions. Boaz ensured that what he was going to do authentically confirmed to the spirit, as well of the strict letter, of Torah law.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">TABC <i>talmid</i> Yehuda Mazin adds that perhaps assembling such prominent people was meant to pressure the <i>goel </i>to act appropriately.</i>",
                "<b>Conclusion</b><br>Based on the Targum, the ten <i>ziknei ha’ir </i>might have been Sanhedrin members, but they were not convening as a formal Sanhedrin or <i>beit din.</i> They met in order to approve of Boaz’s <i>lifnim mishurat ha’din</i> actions, to make sure they conformed to both the technical Torah laws and broader Torah values."

The requirement for an <i>ach</i> is stressed in the extensive Halachic discussion of whether an <i>ach mumar</i> (apostate brother) may perform <i>yibbum</i>.

                "<b>Approach #1 — Ibn Ezra</b><br>Ibn Ezra offers a down-to-earth explanation. Ibn Ezra to <i>pasuk</i> 3 and <i>pasuk</i> 6 explains that the <i>goel</i> already had a large tract of land, and he felt that adding the responsibility of an yet another additional tract of land would be too much for him to manage. This fits with the concern he voiced in <i>pasuk 6,</i> “lest he destroy his <i>nachalah</i>” by expanding too much.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is reminiscent of Chazal’s expression (<i>Chagigah</i> 17a), “<i>Tafasta merubah lo tafasta</i>” — one fails if he grabs too much. </i> This approach might not reflect poorly on the <i>goel’s</i> refusal to marry Rut, since his demurral seems reasonable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On the other hand, Rabbi Aharon Lichtenstein (as is typical for a Rosh Yeshiva) urged his students to have ambition and realize that we can accomplish more than we think we are capable. Ibn Ezra might explain the downgrading of the <i>goel</i> to Peloni Almoni based on the <i>goel’s</i> unwillingness to stretch himself for the sake of a mitzvah. TABC <i>talmidim</i> Menachem Kravetz and Yoni Weinreich note the <i>goel’s</i> unwillingness to act outside of his comfort zone. They note the parallel to Orpah who was willing to go with Naomi only to the extent of her comfort zone.</i>",
                "Ibn Ezra’s explanation may seem a bit too simple for a decision of momentous ramifications — the progenitor of the royal line.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This noted by TABC <i>talmid</i> Ving Levy.</i> However, sometimes we miss out on a magnificent opportunity due to small-mindedness or lack of ambition.",
                "<b>Approach #2 — Targum</b><br>Interestingly, the Targum and the Yesh Omerim cited by Ibn Ezra to <i>pasuk</i> 6 say that Peloni Almoni was already married, and marriage to Rut would severely disrupt his existing marriage. “Lest I destroy my <i>nachalah,</i>” therefore, refers to the <i>goel’s </i>marriage. However, this is not the most popular approach, since we can hardly blame the <i>goel</i> for not wanting to destroy his marriage (recall that referring to the <i>goel </i>as <i>Peloni Almoni </i>implies dissatisfaction with his behavior). Moreover, Boaz was the superior candidate to marry Rut since, as taught by Chazal, Boaz was unmarried, as he had lost his wife. It would seem that this approach does not view the <i>goel </i>negatively for not marrying Rut.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Interestingly, this approach serves as a basis in Tanach for Rabbeinu Gershom’s tenth-century <i>cheirem</i> banning polygamy. This resolves a problem that is raised in regards to the <i>chereim d’Rabbeinu Gershom</i>. The Taz (<i>Yoreh Dei’ah</i> 117:1) writes that Chazal may not forbid that which the Torah explicitly permits. While the Taz’s assertion is subject to considerable debate, in regards to the <i>chereim d’Rabeinu Gershom,</i> one could say that the Targum teaches that although the Torah permits polygamy, it is a potentially destructive practice. TABC <i>talmid</i> Ephraim Helfgot correctly notes, though, that this message is already communicated by <i>Sefer Bereishit</i> recording the catastrophic results of polygamous marriages. </i>",

                "The evidence for this approach seems to be in <i>pasuk</i> 5, where Boaz explicitly referred to Rut as a Moabite.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On the other hand, TABC <i>talmidim</i> noted that Rut is repeatedly referred to as “<i>Ha’Moaviyah”</i> throughout <i>Megillat Rut</i>. “<i>Moaviyah</i>” might have simply been the standard way that she was often described. </i> Is there any justification for the <i>goel’s</i> refusal according to this approach? Rashi, citing from Chazal, criticizes the <i>goel </i>for his ignorance and rejection of Chazal’s limitation of the prohibition to male Moabites. Chazal understand <i>“Lo yavo Moavi be’kehal Hashem</i>” to refer to a male Moabite — “<i>v’lo Moaviyah,”</i> and not to a female Moabite (Yevamot 76b-77a).",
                "However, an examination of the Gemara’s discussion of this issue reveals that this interpretation was subject to heated debate. This interpretation was challenged, noting that the prohibition to marry a <i>mamzer</i> is not limited to males. The fact that the Gemara's discussion goes back and forth, and that two proofs are needed to prove <i>“Amoni v’lo Amonit, Moavi v’lo Moavit” </i>(Rabbi Yehuda's <i>pasuk</i> and Rabbi Shimon's <i>sevara</i>) suggests that marrying Rut was a very delicate matter.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Gemara explains that the Torah sets forth a reason for the prohibition to marry a Moabite: they refused to share food when we passed through their land. Female Moabites are not included in this prohibition since the women remained at home and therefore did not fail to provide for the passersby. TABC <i>talmid</i> Avi Tepler cogently notes that Rut acted quite contrary to this line of reasoning, both in <i>perek</i> 2 when she gleans in the field and in her nocturnal visit to Boaz's granary described in <i>perek</i> 3! One may respond that circumstances left Rut no alternative, and that her highly unorthodox behavior demonstrates the cogency of the Gemara’s assertion that a woman’s dignity demands that she remain in the privacy of her home.</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As noted by TABC <i>talmid</i> Ezra Seplowitz.</i>",
                "In addition, the female Moabite issue was resolved by Shmuel HaNavi who lived long after the <i>goel</i> refused to marry Rut. Thus, many question why we should blame the <i>goel </i>for his fear of risking the status of children.",
                "In response, we note that this Gemara casts Doeig HaAdomi as the one who vociferously protests “<i>Moavi v’lo Moaviyah.</i>” Doeig is viewed as an archvillain due to his cooperation with Shaul HaMelech in the wholesale murder of the Kohanim of Nov. Moreover, the Mishna (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 10:2) even includes Doeig on a very short list of people denied a place in Olam HaBa! By naming Doeig as the one who contests David HaMelech’s status, the Gemara casts the rejection of <i>Moavi v’lo Moaviyah</i> as a rogue rejection of legitimate Torah interpretation. The fact that the ten <i>ziknei ha’ir</i> approve of Boaz’s marriage to Rut, with Boaz conspicuously mentioning Rut’s identity as a Moabite, without any debate, indicates that the Moabite marriage prohibition being limited to male Moabites was widely accepted. Shmuel HaNavi’s authority was required to roundly reject Doeig’s rogue challenge of what had been settled four generations earlier by the elders of Beit Lechem.",
                "The <i>goel </i>and Doeig’s rejection of the <i>Moavi v’lo Moaviyah</i> interpretation is viewed as wrong. Boaz was regarded by Chazal as the <i>gadol ha’dor,</i> and his actions were unanimously supported by ten <i>ziknei ha’ir</i> of Beit Lechem, while the <i>goel </i>and Doeig were both guilty of refusing to accept recognized rabbinic authority.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The matter being resolved by Shmuel and his <i>beit din</i> does not imply that this issue had not been resolved beforehand. The Gemara highlights Doeig impudently ignoring the ruling of the elders of Beit Lechem. </i>",
                "To help place Rashi’s explanation in perspective, let us consider the following <i>mashal</i>. In 1975, a man and woman were close to being engaged. As their relationship developed, they discovered that the woman’s mother had remarried without a <i>get</i> from her first husband, and the potentail bride was from her mother’s second marriage. The couple approached Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, the era’s uncontested <i>posek ha’dor</i>, and he ruled that the woman was not a <i>mamzeret</i>, since the woman’s mother’s first marriage was invalid due to it being a Conservative wedding.

                "<b>Approach #4 — A New Approach</b><br>Let us carefully examine <i>pasuk</i> 5. Notice that according to Boaz’s proposal, the goal of the marriage to Rut was לְהָקִים שֵׁם-הַמֵּת, עַל-נַחֲלָתוֹ — to reconstitute the <i>nachalah</i> of Machlon. Children born to the <i>goel</i> and Rut would inherit Machlon’s share in the land.",

Rather, that the land was <i>meshuabad</i> (mortgaged) for the payment of the <i>ketubah</i>. Malbim’s comment is a basis for the <i>shtar chatzi zachar</i>, a document which entitles a daughter to inherit a portion of her father’s estate without violating the Halachot of <i>yerushah</i> (see <i>Rama Even HaEzer</i> 113:2, <i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 281:7, and my <i>Gray Matter</i> 3:286-287). </i> Rambam (<i>Hilchot Nachalot</i> 6:1) holds that a <i>t’nai </i>(stipulation by the testator) does not override the <i>yerushah</i> rules.

                "<b>Option #1:</b> Naomi sold Elimelech’s <i>nachalah</i>, ancestral land, after she returned to Beit Lechem, and in <i>perek 4, </i>a family member was called upon to redeem, or return, the land to the family.

Second, why would Elimelech, a wealthy man, sell a field during a <i>ra’av, </i>famine, when land prices presumably hit rock bottom — who wants to buy land during a severe famine? Lastly, <i>pasuk</i> 5 indicates that the field was to be purchased from Naomi and Rut, not a third party to whom Elimelech sold the field.",

Naomi was mortified to claim her right to her husband’s ancestral land and to sell a portion of it to support herself and Rut. This approach is similar to the suggestion we set forth in option #4. TABC <i>talmid</i> David Berger asks, why, then, were Rut and Naomi entitled to take <i>tzedakah</i>? David suggests that as a chesed, which is the predominant theme of <i>Megillat Rut</i>, Boaz permitted Rut to take <i>leket</i> even though she was not entitled. One could argue, though, that Boaz had no right to deprive the eligible poor from the <i>leket</i> to which they were entitled. We suggest that Naomi and Rut were indeed entitled to take from <i>leket</i> despite their ability to tap Elimelech’s <i>nachalah</i>. This right stems from their psychological inability to access their asset, Elimelech’s land. This situation is analogous to the Mishna (<i>Pei’ah</i> 5:4) that permits a wealthy traveler to take <i>leket</i> since he is not able to access his money at that time. Rav Asher Weiss, as reported by Rav Yossi Stern <i>zt”l,</i> drew an analogy between this Mishna and a widow who was psychologically unable to access the assets left by her husband, and permitted her to receive <i>tzedakah</i> money.</i>",
                "<b>Option #4</b>: In an effort to solve this problem and the problem of Elimelech’s estate not supporting Naomi and Rut, this fourth option relates to the episode recorded in <i>Melachim II</i> 8:1-3.

We suggest it typically went to the next in line of <i>yerushah</i>. Abandoning Eretz Yisrael was seen as the equivalent of dying, a theme that resonates with the beginning of <i>Rut perek</i> 1, and thus the next in the <i>yerushah</i> line assumes the <i>nachalah.</i>",

The previous <i>pasuk </i>is a highly unusual one; it is a very rare interruption to help us understand the <i>kinyan</i>. <i>Pasuk</i> 7 demands an explanation as to its necessity.",
                "<b>A Very Ancient Practice that Continues Until Today</b><br>The practice of handing a <i>kli</i> to one another in order to seal a deal, which is practiced until today, is a very ancient practice, as <i>pasuk</i> 7 states. This is done when appointing the rabbi to sell <i>chametz</i>, and at weddings when the <i>chatan</i> accepts his obligations to the <i>kallah</i> as set forth in the <i>ketubah</i>. This is called a <i>kinyan sudar</i>, as ever since the time of the Gemara it has been common to perform this <i>kinyan</i> with a <i>sudar</i> — handkerchief.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Pitchei Teshuvah</i> (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 201:1) cites opinions (<i>Teshuvot Chatam Sofer Choshen Mishpat</i> 12) that <i>kinyan situmta</i> (a <i>kinyan</i> executed in accordance with common business custom and not by Torah or rabbinic authority) is valid even on a Torah level. It is therefore commonly employed by community rabbis as one of the means of transferring ownership of <i>chametz</i> to a non-Jew before Pesach (<i>Aruch HaShulchan</i>, <i>Orach Chaim</i> 448:21 and 28). <i>Teshuvot Devar Avraham</i> (1:1) bolsters the opinion of the <i>Chatam Sofer</i> in a celebrated responsum. He argues that even <i>kinyan sudar</i> is an example of a <i>kinyan</i> recognized by Halacha that emerged from common practice. This is indicated by <i>pasuk</i> 7 <i>“Ve’zot lefanim beYisrael</i>,” that it is a <i>kinyan</i> introduced by the people and not by the Torah or Chazal. Nonetheless, it is a <i>kinyan</i> whose validity and effectiveness is recognized by the Torah.</i>",
                "Why is it important for us to know how Boaz and the <i>goel</i> formalized their agreement? The flow of the story would seemingly be complete without these <i>pesukim</i>. It would seem more appropriate for this to be part of a discussion in the Talmud’s <i>Masechet Bava Metzia, </i>rather than in <i>Megillat Rut</i>.",
                "<b>Resolving an Ambiguity</b><br>Rashi to <i>pasuk </i>8 quotes the Gemara (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 47a) presenting a dispute among the Talmudic authorities about who handed the shoe to whom. This argument remains relevant today, about whether, when you appoint the rabbi to sell your <i>chametz,</i> you hand the pen to the rabbi or the rabbi hands it to you. Likewise, this argument applies to whether the rabbi hands the <i>chatan</i> a handkerchief at a wedding or the <i>chatan</i> hands it to the rabbi. The Halacha follows the opinion that the rabbi is the one who hands the pen to you, as well as the one who hands it to the <i>chatan<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">At a wedding, the rabbi is acting on behalf of the <i>kallah</i>. The basis of the practice is found in <i>Kiddushin</i> 7a (the <i>eved kena’ani</i> model).</i></i> at a wedding as well — and that Boaz was the one who handed the shoe to the <i>goel</i>.",
                "Ibn Ezra to <i>pasuk</i> 8 cites this dispute and explains the reasoning of both opinions. The opinion that argues that the <i>goel</i> handed the shoe to Boaz believes that the giving of the shoe mirrors the commitment to transfer the right to redeem to Boaz. The other opinion views Boaz giving the shoe as a symbolic consideration to the <i>goel</i>, for transferring the right to redeem the relatives.",
                "Why does the <i>pasuk</i> present the <i>kinyan</i> in such an ambiguous manner?",
                "The Midrash (Rut 7:12) notes two similar ambiguities. The first is when Shmuel tore clothes in connection with replacing Shaul, where it is not clear if Shmuel tore his own clothes or those of Shaul. The second is when Achiyah HaShiloni appointed Yerovam ben Nevat to take over ten of the Shevatim from the rule of Beit David, where it is not clear if he tore his own clothes or those of Yerovam.",
                "Interestingly, all three ambiguities involve fateful decisions that determine the long-term direction of the royal line. We suggest that <i>pasuk</i> 8 is deliberately presented ambiguously to convey the connection between these three <i>pesukim</i>. The two possible interpretations express the two possible directions that the royal line could have taken. The line could have stemmed from the <i>goel,</i> had he committed to Rut and the restitution of both the Elimelech and Machlon family lines, or from Boaz, as it ultimately did.",
                "Accordingly, Shmuel HaNavi records the <i>kinyan</i> in order to convey that a critical decision was made at this point that determined the course of the royal line for generations.",
                "<b>The Narrator’s Note — A Bold Explanation</b><br><i>Pasuk</i> 7 clarifies why a shoe, which is characteristic of <i>chalitzah</i>, was used to make this <i>kinyan</i>, when any <i>kli</i> could’ve worked. On a simple level, it seems that this <i>pasuk</i> clarifies that the <i>kinyan</i> with the shoe had nothing to do with <i>chalitzah</i>, even though it smacks of <i>chalitzah</i> and it is certainly a <i>chalitzah</i>-like situation.",
                "Ibn Ezra to <i>pasuk</i> 8 explains that a shoe was used because it is a <i>kli</i> that is readily available to perform the <i>kinyan</i>. Today, it is done with a watch, a pen or a smartphone, but, of course, these were not available, לְפָנִים בְּיִשְׂרָאֵל.",
                "However, we believe that there is a deeper explanation that connects <i>kinyan sudar</i> with <i>chalitzah</i>. Rambam writes in <i>Hilchot Mechira</i> 5:14-16 that <i>kinyan sudar</i> is an expression of commitment,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rambam and Ra’avad (<i>Hilchot Mechira</i> 5:4) disagree as to whether <i>eidim</i> are required for <i>kinyan sudar</i>. The fact that Boaz mentioned the word <i>eidim</i> twice (4:9-10) when he made the <i>kinyan sudar</i> with the <i>goel,</i> and the <i>zekeinim</i> (4:11) responded and confirmed that they were indeed <i>eidim</i>, supports the Ra’avad’s stance that <i>eidim</i> are required. In fact, Rav Zusha (Sidney) Harcsztark <i>zt”l</i> told me (on Shavuot 5740) that he heard Rabbi Yosef Dov Soloveitchik say that this point serves as a potent <i>ra’ayah</i> to the Ra’avad. Rambam could respond that <i>eidim</i> were necessary not for the <i>kinyan</i>, per se, but to publicize the acceptability of marriage to a female convert from Moav. Indeed, the Gemara (<i>Ketubot</i> 7b) explains that this is the purpose of Boaz assembling the ten elders.</i> resolve and seriousness of intent.",
                "Perhaps <i>pasuk</i> 7 conveys that conducting <i>kinyan sudar</i> with a shoe is a very old practice amongst our people (see Ibn Ezra to <i>pasuk</i> 7 s.v. <i>Ve’zot Lefanim</i>). We suggest that it even predates Matan Torah, possibly originating in Mitzrayim when we were slaves with nothing other than our shoes with which to make a <i>kinyan</i>. Alternatively, it is possible that right after Matan Torah we began to use a shoe for a <i>kinyan</i>, in contrast to <i>chalitzah</i>.",
                "The <i>yevamah</i> (deceased brother’s widow) removing the shoe of the <i>yavam </i>(brother of the deceased), we boldly suggest, is Hashem designing a mitzvah to mirror the practice of <i>kinyan</i> with a shoe: The handing of the shoe in the context of <i>kinyan sudar</i> expresses commitment, while the removal of the shoe in the context of <i>chalitzah</i> represents a lack of commitment (an “un-<i>kinyan</i>,” if you will). Thus, this is an expression of disdain (like the spitting of <i>chalitzah)</i> — you are the opposite of the <i>kinyan</i> commonly done with a shoe; you failed to make a commitment!",
                "It is possible that the use of a shoe fell out of use by Boaz’s era. Boaz resurrected the ancient practice to use a shoe to express that he was acting in the opposite manner of <i>chalitzah</i>; he was willing to commit to restoring the families of Elimelech and Machlon, unlike the <i>goel</i> who, like the brother-in-law from whom the shoe is removed, is unable to make the commitment.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">TABC <i>talmid</i> Shimon Greengart notes that this interpretation assumes that “<i>Ve’zot lefanim beYisrael”</i> refers to a time before Boaz. Shimon notes, though, that it could refer to the time of Boaz, as the practice of using a shoe to make the <i>kinyan</i> fell into disuse by the time Shmuel HaNavi composed <i>Megillat Rut</i>. Interestingly, a similar narrator’s note appears in <i>Shmuel I</i> 9:9.</i>",
                "Thus, the narrator in <i>pasuk</i> 7 helps us understand the rich symbolism employed by Boaz in <i>pasuk</i> 8. Perhaps it is because both options express the point of the <i>kinyan</i>: Boaz giving the shoe to the <i>goel</i> demonstrates his commitment, and the <i>goel</i> removing his shoe in handing to Boaz smacks of <i>chalitzah</i>, since he is acting in a “<i>chalitzah-like</i>” manner.",
                "<b>Conclusion</b><br><i>Megillat Rut</i> records <i>pesukim</i> 7-8 to communicate the following crucial points: The ambiguity of <i>pasuk</i> 8 denotes that a major decision was made regarding the royal line. <i>Pasuk</i> 7 helps us understand that the reason for the royal line emerging from Boaz and not the <i>goel</i> is Boaz’s willingness to make a commitment. This is reminiscent of Yehuda; Yaakov pronounces Yehuda as the royal tribe, since Yehuda commits to taking responsibility for Binyamin (Bereishit 43:9), unlike the firstborn Reuven who failed to make such a commitment. At a crossroads of the direction of the royal line, it is the one who makes the commitment who triumphs.",
                "The iconic handing of the shoe from Boaz to the <i>goel</i> broadcasts a poignant lesson: Those who commit finish first, while those who fail to make or honor their commitments finish last."

The question arises to a great extent since there are more than one city called Beit Lechem in Eretz Yisrael (for this reason the first <i>pasuk</i> in <i>Megillat Rut</i> identifies the city as Beit Lechem Yehuda, meaning the Beit Lechem located in Yehuda, in contrast to Batei Lechem located in the <i>nachalah</i> of other <i>shevatim</i>).

All this adds to the beauty of the scene described by Chazal (Bava Batra 91b): Shlomo HaMelech, at his inauguration, set aside a special seat of honor for Rut — אמה של מלכות — who persevered against all odds to raise a family that would emerge as the eternal royal family of our people."

            "<i>Megillat Rut</i> sets forth the roadmap on how to progress from the State of Israel to <i>Yemot HaMashiach</i>, the Messianic era. Contemporary Israel has much in common with the Sefer Shofetim era; many of the same societal ills and challenges have emerged. We as a people are, <i>Baruch Hashem</i>, in our land, but we lurch from both internal and external crisis to crisis. The self-centered mindset seems to be pervasive on a national level (with, of course, many significant exceptions).",
            "Perhaps the remedy is that the Jewish People take to heart the lessons taught by <i>Megillat Rut</i>. The emergent lessons will elevate and transform us from the current chaos to an age where we will be led by a descendent of David HaMelech, Mashiach Tzidkeinu."
