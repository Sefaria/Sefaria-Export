            "<b>A King Over Israel</b>",
            "Devarim 17:14-20 establishes the Halachic framework for the kingship in Eretz Yisrael. Much has been discussed in regard to the nature of these verses. Are they to be treated as an obligation, or do they offer a Halachic structure for a voluntary institution? Is the existence of a corporeal kingship over Israel a fulfillment of an ideal, or a failure? Regardless, these verses were actualized when Shemuel anointed Sha’ul as king over Israel (Shemuel I 9-10).",
            "<i><b>“Mishneh Torah” in Sefer Devarim</b></i>",
            "A Jewish king has both restrictions and responsibilities. He cannot have too many horses, marry too many wives, or amass too much wealth. In terms of obligations, Devarim 17:18 tasks the king with the writing of a “<i>Mishneh Torah</i>”:",
            "<i>“VeHaya KeShivto Al Kisei Memelacheto VeKatav Lo Et Mishneh HaTorah HaZot Al Sefer MiLifnei HaKohanim HaLevi’im,” “And it shall be when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, he shall write for himself a Mishneh Torah in a book, from before the Kohanim and Levi’im.”</i>",
            "The term “<i>Mishneh” </i>can be rendered in a variety of ways, and is most frequently translated as “second.” According to this interpretation, the king is required to write two Sifrei Torah. While there is a broader national obligation to write a Sefer Torah (Devarim 31:19), a king is obligated to write an additional Sefer Torah. The Gemara (Sanhedrin 21b) elaborates that one Torah is to be held in the king’s treasury, and the other must be kept on his person at all times. The purpose of this constant exposure is explicated by the Pesukim (Devarim 17:19-20):",
            "<i>It shall be with him, and he shall read from it all the days of his life, so that he will learn to fear Hashem, his God, to observe all the words of the Torah and these decrees, to perform them; so that his heart does not become haughty over his brethren and not turn from the commandment right or left, so that he will prolong years over his kingdom, he and his sons amid Israel.</i>",
            "<i><b>“Mishneh Torah” in Sefer Yehoshua</b></i>",
            "The only other time the term <i>Mishneh Torah </i>is used in Tanach is after the battle of Ai when Yehoshua inscribes the “<i>Mishneh Torat Moshe</i>” on stones (Yehoshua 8:32). Radak explains that the basis for the word <i>Mishneh </i>is the phrase “<i>VeShinantam LeVanecha</i>,” “and you shall teach them [the words of the Torah] to your sons” (Devarim 6:7). While the roots of “<i>VeShinantam</i>” and “<i>Mishneh</i>” are different, Radak submits that they both refer to clarification and teaching. Radak cites R. Saadia Gaon, who says that Yehoshua only inscribed a list of Mitzvot on the stones and not the entire Torah. Yehoshua’s inscription served to clarify and summarize the words of the Torah.",
            "Likewise, Rashash believes that the king’s “<i>Mishneh Torah” </i>is also a bullet point summary of the Mitzvot. He bases his interpretation on Targum Onkelos, which renders “<i>Mishneh Torah</i>” as “<i>Patshegen Oraiyta</i>,” meaning the essence or summary of the Torah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This interpretation of “Patshegen” is based on an understanding of Esther 4:8, in which Mordechai gives Hatach the “Patshegen Ketav HaDat,” “written text of the law” that proclaims the destruction of the Jews. Presumably, this “written text of the law” is a summary of the full legislation. See the Malbim’s commentary on Esther 4:8. </i>",
            "<i><b>The Failures of the Malchut</b></i>",
            "Regardless of interpretation, the purpose of the king’s obligation to write a <i>“Mishneh Torah”</i> is clear. The king must be continuously cognizant of the fact that there is a King above him, and that he answers to Him. Unfortunately, time and time again, many of the kings of Sefer Melachim fail to take this message to heart. They fail to heed the words of the various Nevi’im and fail to rid the land of the Bamot and Avodah Zarah. And, as Rambam writes (Hilchot Melachim 3:6), “<i>SheLibo Hu Leiv Kol Kahal Yisrael</i>,” “for his heart in the heart of the congregation of Israel,” the kings’ spiritually deficient behaviors are reflected in the nation’s attitude towards Torah and each other. Eventually, the sins accumulate, the Beit HaMikdash is destroyed, and the nation is exiled. The message of the “<i>Mishneh Torah”</i> is ignored— such is the story of Sefer Melachim.",
            "<i><b>From David to Destruction</b></i>",
            "Throughout the 2018-19 school year, Rabbi Jachter taught Sefer Melachim to 102 students at the Torah Academy of Bergen County (TABC). Every class, Rabbi Jachter would supply the students with textual material to be studied BeChavruta, in pairs. Towards the end of the period, Rabbi Jachter would assemble the class to discuss the lesson. <i>From David to Destruction </i>is a collection of those discussions.",
            "If the king “shall write for himself” a “<i>Patshegen Oraiyta</i>,” then <i>From David to Destruction</i>, in a similar vein, is an expression of that charge on an institutional level, in which we have recorded and compiled some of the Torah taught at TABC. As the Gemara (Chagigah 3a) boldly posits, “<i>Ee Efshar LeBeit HaMidrash BeLo Chiddush,</i>” “there cannot be a study hall without novelty.” Rabbi Jachter’s class at TABC has produced incredibly innovative insights into Sefer Melachim, and this work aims to share those insights with the broader community.",
            "Rabbi Jachter has fostered a tradition of student involvement in the publication of his books, going back to the year 2000, with (now Rabbi) Ezra Frazer’s (‘96) involvement in the publication of <i>Gray Matter</i>. I began working on <i>From David to Destruction </i>in May 2019, as a part of my senior work-study project.",
            "Throughout my time at TABC, I had the opportunity to work closely with Rabbi Jachter on <i>Kol Torah,</i> the weekly Torah bulletin published under his guidance. I am incredibly grateful for the time I have been able to spend with him, and I look forward to continuing our close relationship in the future.",
            "It is my hope, Be’Ezrat Hashem, that <i>From David to Destruction</i> will inspire others in their study of Sefer Melachim, and that it will encourage further student contribution to the community’s Torah discourse.",

            "<b>The Abarbanel’s Question</b>",
            "The Abarbanel raises a very straightforward and compelling question. The story of the life of David HaMelech is recounted in Sefer Shemuel. Why then, is the story of the end of David HaMelech’s life not included in Sefer Shemuel? Why does it make its way to Sefer Melachim,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A simple answer might be that at least a part of David HaMelech’s life is included in Sefer Melachim since David HaMelech serves as the gauge for the evaluation of the kings of Sefer Melachim. Kings in Sefer Melachim are rated as either as good, worse or, rarely, even possibly better than David HaMelech. </i> which recounts the story of Shlomo HaMelech?",
            "<i><b>The Abarbanel and Malbim’s Answer</b></i>",
            "The Abarbanel and Malbim answer<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Abarbanel and Malbim differ in their respective explanations as to why the Avishag HaShunamit episode is included in Sefer Melachim. </i> that David HaMelech’s infirmity explains the reason why Adoniyahu takes the initiative to take the kingship. Adoniyahu, in the Malbim’s view, perceives David HaMelech to be irrelevant and decides that the time to appoint his replacement has arrived. Therefore, Adoniyahu grabs onto what he perceived as his opportunity to become the king. This story is included in Sefer Melachim since Shlomo HaMelech, about whom the beginning of Sefer Melachim focuses, rises to the throne in the wake of Adoniyahu’s misguided attempt to seize power.",
            "<i><b>The Prophetic Agenda of a Sefer in Tanach</b></i>",
            "We suggest that we can answer the Abarbanel’s question by identifying the respective agendas of Sefer Melachim and Sefer Shemuel. How might one detect and identify the prophetic agenda of a Sefer of Tanach? In some Sefarim, one might be able to do so by noticing the shift from the beginning of the Sefer to the end of the Sefer. Three examples illustrate this principle:",
            "1.\tSefer Shemot begins with the Bnei Yisrael as slaves in Mitzrayim with Hashem in His mode of “<i>Hester Panim</i>,” where He conceals His involvement in the world. Yet at its conclusion, Hashem’s pronounced presence in the Mishkan serves as the centerpiece of the encampment of a nation freed from the bondage of slavery. Thus, Sefer Shemot may be summarized as the Bnei Yisrael’s transition from a condition of slavery and alienation from Hashem, to a situation of both spiritual and physical freedom.",
            "2.\tSefer Shemuel begins with a sorely fragmented nation in the problematic waning days of the Mishkan in Shilo. It concludes with David HaMelech laying the groundwork for the building of the Beit HaMikdash. Sefer Shemuel, accordingly, may be defined as the dramatic ascent of Am Yisrael from a splintered people with a problematic spiritual center to a people with a great leader, ushering in the dawn of the era of the Beit HaMikdash.",
            "3.\tSefer Yechezkeil begins with the Navi Yechezkeil prophesying on the banks of the river Kevar, deep in the Babylonian exile, and concludes with a grand vision of the third Beit HaMikdash. It would seem, then, that the agenda of Sefer Yechezeil is a spiritual roadmap as to how to extract ourselves from the mire of the exile, and arrive at the exalted redemption in Jerusalem.",
            "We suggest the application of this model to Sefer Melachim and Divrei HaYamim. Sefer Melachim begins with David HaMelech on the throne and concludes with an episode relevant to our exile in Babylon. Thus, we may presume that the agenda of Sefer Melachim is to explain the Bnei Yisrael’s deterioration from the pinnacle of having a great king sitting on the throne in Yerushalayim, to a people ensconced in the Babylonian exile. In other words, we may call Sefer Melachim, “<i>Sefer HaChurban</i>,” “the Book of the Destruction,” since it provides a prophetic explanation for the Churban.",
            "This perspective fits perfectly with Chazal’s assertion (Bava Batra 14b-15a) that Yirmiyahu HaNavi authored Sefer Melachim. It is most fitting that the Navi of the Churban authored the Sefer of the Churban. Even the Abarbanel, who sometimes questions Chazal’s identification of the authors of the various Sefarim of Tanach, subscribes to Chazal’s view that Yirmiyahu HaNavi authored Sefer Melachim. It is indeed a compelling assertion.",
            "Divrei HaYamim, on the other hand, concludes with a much more optimistic event— Cyrus’s permission to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the Beit HaMikdash. Divrei HaYamim essentially is a new presentation of the events of Sefer Shemuel and Sefer Melachim, written in the time of Bayit Sheini.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Bava Batra 15a. The Abarbanel assumes Ezra composed all of Divrei HaYamim. </i> However, its agenda in retelling these stories in a somewhat of a new fashion is to teach us <i>“Shiru LaHashem Shir Chadash</i>,” to “sing a new song to Hashem” (Tehillim 96:1).",
            "In other words, Divrei HaYamim presents the stories of Sefer Melachim<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Perhaps this is why the more optimistic Sefer Shemuel narrative is merged with the Sefer Melachim narrative in Divrei HaYamim to constitute one Sefer. </i> in a more optimistic style to encourage and inspire the Jews at the dawn of the era of Bayit Sheini in their quest to rebuild the Beit HaMikdash, Eretz Yisrael, and themselves. Thus, it is not surprising that Divrei HaYamim begins by outlining the beginning of humanity—<i> “Adam, Sheit, Enosh</i>” (Divrei HaYamim I 1:1). Divrei HaYamim represents a new beginning and a fresh start. No longer are the Bnei Yisrael encumbered by the sins of the past. It is a new beginning and, so to speak, a second creation of humanity.",
            "<i><b>Our New Answer</b></i>",
            "Based on this approach, we suggest that Sefer Shemuel does not end with David HaMelech’s death, since Sefer Shemuel’s agenda is not to present the biography of David HaMelech. Rather, it concludes with the story of David HaMelech’s acquisition of Aravnah the Yevusi’s granary as the future site of the Beit HaMikdash and his construction of a Mizbei’ach on the site, since the agenda of Sefer Shemuel is, as we said, to describe the dramatic ascent of Am Yisrael from a splintered people with a problematic spiritual center to a people with a great leader, ushering in the dawn of the era of the Beit HaMikdash.",
            "Sefer Melachim, in turn, begins with the story of David HaMelech’s death since it sketches the Bnei Yisrael’s deterioration from the pinnacle of his sitting on the throne in Yerushalayim, to a people ensconced in the Babylonian exile.",
            "We may add that the Adoniyahu debacle and our narrow escape from it illustrates a major theme of Sefer Melachim and Sefer Yirmiyahu. Adoniyahu nearly emerges as a king, due to the ill-advised neglect of the prophetic message of Natan HaNavi, whom Melachim I 1:8 specifically notes is not included in the effort to coronate Adoniyahu. A disastrous reign of Adoniyahu, in turn, is narrowly averted due to David HaMelech and Batsheva heeding the advice and intervention of Natan HaNavi.",
            "Failure on the part of the last Judean kings to heed Yirmiyahu’s repeated calls to submit to Babylon directly led to the Churban. These less than excellent kings thought they knew better than the Navi, similar to Adoniyahu. Thus, the story of the Adoniyahu rebellion very much belongs in Sefer Melachim,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Achav in Melachim I 22 similarly falls in battle due in part to his spurning the wise advice of the Navi, and listening instead to the false prophets who predict his victory. Yarav’am ben Nevat in Melachim I 14 also suffers a staggering loss due to his failure to internalize the message of Achiyah HaShiloni. </i> which highlights the failures that emerge from disregard for prophetic message and intervention.",
            "On the other hand, the Adoniyahu story is not included in Divrei HaYamim since its sobering lesson does not fit with the prophetic agenda of this Sefer— to uplift the spirit of the Jews rebuilding their lives at the outset of Bayit Sheini.",
            "<i><b>Conclusion</b></i>",
            "One of the earliest and wisest pieces of advice this author received when he began designing community Eruvin is that sometimes taking the bigger picture into account resolves smaller scale issues. The same applies to Tanach learning, as we have seen in this discussion. Perhaps by considering the overall agenda of Sefer Shemuel and Sefer Melachim, we best solved the mystery of the inclusion of the last days of David HaMelech in Sefer Melachim. Instead of focusing on the more narrow local issues of the opening chapters of Sefer Melachim, the utilization of a wider perspective might present a more convincing solution.",
            "<i><b>Postscript</b></i>",
            "The differences between the respective agendas of the various Sefarim of Tanach are most worthy of bearing in mind when delving into Sefer Melachim. Differences between Sefer Melachim and Divrei HaYamim abound, and keeping in mind the different agendas of both Sefarim will play a very significant role in resolving these difficulties."

                "<i><b>The Abarbanel’s Question</b></i>",
                "The Abarbanel’s question regarding David HaMelech’s instruction to Shlomo HaMelech to kill Yoav ben Tzeruyah looms large whenever one encounters Melachim I 2. This story is read relatively frequently, as it serves as the Haftarah for Parashat VaYechi.",
                "The question is as follows: If Yoav is such a terrible villain, as David HaMelech portrays him to be on his deathbed, why does David HaMelech delegate Yoav’s execution to Shlomo HaMelech? Why does David HaMelech not kill Yoav himself?",
                "<i><b>The Malbim and Abarbanel</b></i>",
                "The Abarbanel answers that while Yoav poses a nuisance to David HaMelech during his reign, he does not pose a mortal threat to David HaMelech’s well-established and well-accepted rule. Shlomo HaMelech, who is installed on the throne, and avoids death at the hands of his rivals by the proverbial skin of his teeth, is far more vulnerable. Thus, since Yoav presents a potentially mortal threat to Shlomo HaMelech and his reign, David HaMelech gives Shlomo HaMelech the order to eliminate Yoav if the latter deems it necessary.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Abarbanel understands David’s command to kill Yoav not as punishment for his past heinous actions (as Radak believes), but rather as a warning to not follow his example, and eliminate Yoav if he perceives him as a danger. </i>",
                "The Malbim answers that David HaMelech tolerates Yoav since he is needed for his exceptional military capabilities.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Makkot 2:7, which describes Yoav ben Tzeruyah as an exceptionally talented military leader.</i> Presumably, by the time Shlomo HaMelech assumes the throne, Yoav is considerably past his prime and is no longer needed to the extent he was needed during David HaMelech’s reign.",
                "In addition, Shlomo HaMelech’s reign is a time of military stability, during which military needs are not as urgent as they were during David HaMelech’s reign. For example, in Melachim I 4, Shlomo HaMelech’s minister of defense is listed as fourth in rank of his top advisors, while in Shemuel II 20:23-26, David HaMelech’s minister of defense is listed first.",
                "Moreover, the long list of top warriors who serve under David HaMelech that appears in Shemuel II 23 has no parallel in Sefer Melachim in regard to Shlomo HaMelech. While Shlomo HaMelech does establish a permanent army, it seems that there is not a pressing need for one outstanding person such as Yoav to be deemed indispensable to the extent that his major sins need to be overlooked.",
                "<i><b>Make a New Plan, Shlomo HaMelech</b></i>",
                "The overarching message that David HaMelech imparts to Shlomo HaMelech is not to remain mired in the past. Shlomo HaMelech will face new challenges and he must adjust and not simply (to use sports terminology) run “plays” from his father’s “playbook.” He will have to “be a man,” as David HaMelech instructs him (Melachim I 2:2), and chart new paths to confront the brave new world that he will face.",
                "The mistake of failing to adjust to a new reality is a common one, both within and outside of the Torah world. During World War I, casualty rates were astronomically high due, to a great extent, to the fact that the strategies did not keep pace with the technological advancement of the employed weaponry. Thus, charging at a front line defended by soldiers equipped with machine guns was a nineteenth-century strategy facing twentieth-century technology that led to exceptionally lethal results.",

                "This strategy fails miserably due to Rechav’am’s failure to adjust to the new reality. First, the people have completely run out of patience with the heavy labor and financial tax burden imposed on them by Shlomo HaMelech, and are no longer willing or able to tolerate it. Second, Rechav’am (to paraphrase Ronald Reagan) is no Shlomo HaMelech, and his threats of violent enforcement of his taxation policies are, at best, not taken seriously.",
                "Other examples of leaders who fail to adjust are the kings of the Northern Kingdom. Despite repeated failures and dynasties that do not stand the test of time, king after northern king maintain Yarav'am ben Nevat’s failed religious reforms. Most disappointing is Yeihu, who, on the one hand, courageously carries out his prophetic mandate to eliminate Avodah Zarah, and on the other hand, fails to change course and eliminate Yarav'am’s failed new Judaism.",
                "The final kings of Yehudah also fail to adjust to the new reality and Yirmiyahu’s bold prophetic message to capitulate to Babylonian rule. False prophets and other misguided leaders prop up the last Judean kings’ wishes to misguidedly attempt to preserve the status quo of Jewish rule in Eretz Yisrael. All they have to do is adjust to the reality of a temporary seventy-year Babylonian occupation of Eretz Yisrael and perform Teshuvah. Yirmiyahu prophesies (Yirmiyahu 25) that Jewish sovereignty will be restored after the seventy years. Sadly, Yirmiyahu’s message to adjust is spurned, and, ultimately, the Beit HaMikdash is destroyed.

However, as time passes, Shlomo HaMelech does not adjust to the growing discontent that emerges both among his wives and among his constituents. Shlomo HaMelech carries on his plan without adjustment, even after Yarav'am ben Nevat brazenly rebukes him.",
                "While Shlomo HaMelech, for the most part, manages to escape unscathed to the end of his life due to his power and talent, his reign over all of Israel collapses due to his and his son’s failure to adjust to the new reality.",

Da’at Mikra notes that this is the lone example of an ancient Egyptian princess leaving Egypt to marry a king of another country. This singular event points to the fact that Shlomo HaMelech is the regional superpower, to the extent that the king of Egypt wishes to send his daughter to marry Shlomo HaMelech. The marriage to Bat Paroh highlights the esteem in which the neighboring nations hold Shlomo HaMelech.",

The majority of the Mefarshim (commentaries) seek to find a justification for this marriage. The Metzudat David, following in the footsteps of Rambam (Hilchot Issurei Bi’ah 14), asserts that Bat Paroh converts before the marriage. Da’at Mikra supports this assertion from Tehillim 51, which describes a princess’s conversion to Judaism before marrying the king of Israel. It likely refers to Bat Paroh’s conversion.",
                "In regard to the prohibition of marrying an Egyptian even after conversion, as outlined in Devarim 23, the Abarbanel explains that this prohibition is limited to Egyptian males.

This marriage is described in Melachim I 3:1 as a means to forge an alliance between Paroh and Shlomo HaMelech, and not as an expression of Bat Paroh’s wish to draw close to God. Indeed, Rambam mentions that Bat Paroh’s conversion was administered by Hedyodot, meaning a less than stellar Beit Din (rabbinic court).",
                "Moreover, the restriction of the prohibition to marry a Moabite to a female is rooted in the Pasuk. After all, the Torah mentions the reason for the prohibition: the failure of the Moabites to provide for the Bnei Yisrael with bread and water when passing through their land during the journey from Egypt to Israel. Women in the ancient world would not bring food to strangers. Thus, the reason for the prohibition does not apply to females, paving the way to permit the marriage of Rut to Boaz.",
                "By contrast, the Torah does not state a reason to prohibit marriage to an Egyptian. Therefore, there seems hardly a basis in the Torah text to limit the prohibition to marry an Egyptian to male Egyptians. One could defend this restriction by assuming that the reason for the prohibition to marry the first two generations of Egyptian converts is their oppression of the Bnei Yisrael in Mitzrayim. Presumably, the oppression was executed by male and not female oppressors, making room for the female exception to the Egyptian restriction.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For further discussion and debate about the permissibility of marrying a female Egyptian, see Mishnah Yevamot 8:3. </i> The problem with this assertion is that this reason is not stated in the Torah text, leading us to conclude that this justification, along with the offered justifications for the marriage to Bat Paroh, seem shaky at best.",

                "The consensus view is that Shlomo HaMelech does not technically violate the Halachah in marrying Bat Paroh. He does, however, bend the Halachah, to the point where (to paraphrase the language of the Mishnayot in the last chapter of Masechet Shevi’it), “[<i>Ein</i>]<i> Ru’ach Chachamim Nochah Mimenu</i>,<i>”</i> the sages are not pleased with his behavior.",
                "Why does someone as righteous as Shlomo HaMelech bend the Halachah? Melachim I 3:3, a scant two Pesukim away from the recording of Shlomo HaMelech’s marriage to Bat Paroh, provides an answer. Melachim I 3:3 states that “<i>VaYe’ehav Shlomo Et Hashem</i>,” “Shlomo loved Hashem.” Da’at Mikra notes that Shlomo HaMelech is the only individual described as one who loves Hashem! The juxtaposition of Sefer Melachim recording the marriage of Shlomo HaMelech to Bat Paroh, and the mention of the deep love Shlomo HaMelech had for Hashem, seems to provide ample support for the opinion of R. Yosi (Talmud Yerushalmi Sanhedrin 2:6) that Shlomo HaMelech’s intentions in marrying Bat Paro were noble. In the words of R. Yosi, “he [Shlomo HaMelech] sought to attract them [his many wives] with words of Torah, and draw them close to the Divine Presence.”",
                "The Abarbanel and Malbim argue that Shlomo HaMelech is motivated by the security needs of Am Yisrael. Forging a strong alliance with the Egyptian Paroh is a sure way to create a stable peace along Israel’s southern border. R. Yosi sees a far more ambitious goal— the desire to bring the world to recognize Hashem.",
                "We posit that Shlomo HaMelech believes that he can motivate Bat Paroh to sincerely recognize Hashem. Indeed, this is the justification of those who permit conversion of less than committed gentiles— that they will eventually come to recognize the truth of the Torah. Such is the motivation of many great figures ranging from Shlomo HaMelech in the time of the Tanach, Hillel in the time of the Mishnah, and Rav Ben Zion Hai Uzziel in the twentieth century.",
                "Moreover, if Bat Paroh will recognize Hashem, she can then motivate her father to recognize Hashem. Paroh’s recognition of Hashem as the only God can, in turn, lead to global recognition of the Creator. Shlomo HaMelech’s stated goal “<i>LeMa’an Da’at Kol Amei Ha’Aretz Ki Hashem Hu HaElokim, Ein Od</i>,” “that all the peoples of the earth may know that Hashem alone is God, there is no other” (Melachim I 8:60), will then be realized. This is nothing less than a Messianic vision of the entire world’s recognition of Hashem, as prophesied by Yeshayahu, Michah, and Zecharyah.",

                "To grasp Shlomo HaMelech’s motivation, it is also critical to understand a central aspect of his personality. On the Mizbei’ach in Givon (as recorded in Melachim I 3) he offers no less than one thousand Korbanot. Moreover, during the Chanukat Beit HaMikdash (dedication ceremony for the Temple), he offers an astounding twenty thousand cattle and one hundred twenty thousand sheep as sacrifices to Hashem.",
                "Shlomo HaMelech knows only how to think in very large proportions and ambitions. Anything less does not appear on his radar. Thus, his ambitions are no less than Messianic, as his goals are so large. He seems to not be capable of thinking in lesser terms.",

                "Not surprisingly, the long-term result of Shlomo HaMelech’s marriage to Bat Paroh is an unmitigated disaster of epic proportions. At the end of Shlomo HaMelech’s life, as recorded in Melachim I 11, he is not as strong as he is in his youth, and Bat Paroh, along with the other converted wives, introduce Avodah Zarah into Eretz Yisrael (in a later chapter we will explain why Shlomo HaMelech has no choice but to tolerate this horrific behavior).",
                "Moreover, when Paroh is overthrown by Shishak, the Jews of Eretz Yisrael are now faced with a formidable enemy. Shlomo HaMelech is regarded as an ally of Shishak’s foe, thus placing Shlomo HaMelech and Am Yisrael in Shishak’s crosshairs. Although he does not attack Shlomo HaMelech, he does attack his son Rechav’am and despoils Yerushalayim and the Beit HaMikdash of its great wealth.",

                "How can Shlomo HaMelech commit such a grievous error? Rashi to Melachim I 3:1, citing the Gemara (Berachot 8a), notes the juxtaposition of Shimi ben Geira’s death and Shlomo HaMelech’s marriage to Bat Paroh. Chazal posit that Shimi was Shlomo HaMelech’s teacher. After his teacher’s death, Shlomo HaMelech has no one left to rebuke him when he errs.",
                "This teaches a lesson of profound importance. An individual can be wise as Shlomo HaMelech, and yet commit the most grievous of errors if they do not have a teacher to rebuke him. It is told that the Vilna Gaon used to invite the Dubner Maggid to give him Mussar. It is similarly related that Rav Yaakov Kaminetsky was overjoyed in his later years when someone was critical of an action he took. “<i>Ein Adam Ro’eh Nigei Atzmo</i>,” “an individual does not recognize their shortcomings.” Even the wisest of men require an outside consultant to alert them of any forthcoming errors.",
                "Chazal note that unlike Sha’ul HaMelech who has Shemuel HaNavi to offer him rebuke, David HaMelech who has Natan HaNavi to chastise him when needed, Chizkiyahu HaMelech who has Yeshayahu to reprimand him, and Yoshiyahu HaMelech who has Yirmiyahu HaNavi to scold him, nowhere in Tanach is it recorded that Shlomo HaMelech has a Navi on hand to offer him criticism. This is a most unfortunate phenomenon, which eventually leads to the destruction of much of that which Shlomo HaMelech achieves throughout his lifetime.",
                "<i><b>Shlomo HaMelech’s Vidui (Confession)</b></i>",
                "David HaMelech confesses his sins with Batsheva and Uri’ah HaChiti. Does Shlomo HaMelech ever confess his sins? Chazal attribute the authorship of Kohelet to Shlomo HaMelech in his old age. We suggest that Shlomo HaMelech confesses in the penultimate verse of Kohelet, where he writes, “<i>Sof Davar HaKol Nishma, Et Ha’Elokim Yera Ve’Et Mitzvotav Shemor, Ki Zeh Kol Ha’Adam</i>,” “The sum of the matter, when all is considered: Fear Hashem and observe His commandments, for that is man’s whole duty” (Kohelet 12:13).",
                "Shlomo HaMelech’s great love for Hashem, and concomitant lack of Yirat Hashem (fear of God), leads him to bend Hashem’s rules. He mistakenly believes that this will advance Hashem's cause. At the end of his life, Shlomo HaMelech cautions us to temper our love of Hashem with a corresponding Yirat Hashem, and to abide and honor His rules without trying to work our way around them. Failure to observe Hashem’s laws and seeking to dodge them will only lead to failure, as Moshe Rabbeinu warns the Ma’apilim, “<i>Lamah Zeh Atem Overim Et Pi Hashem, Lo Titzlach</i>,” “why do you violate God’s word, for it will not succeed” (BeMidbar 14:41).",
                "<i><b>Conclusion</b></i>",

However, this marriage leads to catastrophic results. We are left with respect for Shlomo HaMelech’s noble intentions and chastened by how even a person renowned for his unparalleled wisdom falters when he does not honor Hashem’s word in the most straightforward of manners."

Melachim I 3:3 records that Shlomo HaMelech loves Hashem, an accolade unique to Shlomo HaMelech among all the kings described in Sefer Melachim (Da’at Mikra). It concludes, though, by noting an exception in that he offered Korbanot on Bamot, altars outside the Beit HaMikdash.",
                "<i><b>Untimely Criticism?</b></i>",
                "The problem with this criticism is that at this time of Shlomo HaMelech’s reign, before the Beit HaMikdash is built, Bamot are permitted. The Mishnah (Zevachim 14:4-8) outlines when Bamot were forbidden and when they were permitted, and specifically notes that Bamot were permitted during the period after the Mishkan at Shiloh was destroyed and before the Beit HaMikdash was built. Thus, why does Sefer Melachim criticize Shlomo HaMelech for offering Korbanot on Bamot at a time when it was permissible to do so?",
                "<i><b>Rashi’s Solution</b></i>",
                "Rashi explains that Sefer Melachim is critical of Shlomo HaMelech for having delayed the building of the Beit HaMikdash until the fourth year of his reign. In other words, Shlomo HaMelech is criticized for offering Korbanot on Bamot at a time when he should have been building the Beit HaMikdash.",
                "Indeed, Divrei HaYamim records at length how David HaMelech thoroughly prepares for the building of the Beit HaMikdash. He raises the money, gathers the building materials, and even composes a Mizmor dedicated for the Chanukat HaBayit, the dedication of the Beit HaMikdash, “<i>Mizmor Shir Chanukat HaBayit LeDavid</i>” (Mizmor 30). David HaMelech also prepares Shlomo HaMelech for the task of building the Beit HaMikdash, so that it will be accomplished as soon as possible. Therefore, it would seem that Shlomo HaMelech’s delay of four years to begin to place David HaMelech’s dream into action is inexcusable.",
                "However, even a brief familiarity with the first two chapters of Sefer Melachim makes the four year delay very understandable. The first few years of Shlomo HaMelech’s reign are quite unstable and chaotic. David HaMelech’s son Adoniyahu vies and angles for the kingdom, even after David HaMelech explicitly designates Shlomo as his successor. Adoniyahu is supported by very powerful forces: Yoav ben Tzeruyah (the head of the army) and Evyatar the Kohein Gadol. Shimi ben Geira, a remnant of supporters of Sha’ul HaMelech, still poses a threat.",
                "The initial years of Shlomo HaMelech’s kingship are devoted to the stabilization of his reign. This is hardly a time to begin the enormous task of building the Beit HaMikdash.

This approach assumes that permission to offer on Bamot is not granted wholeheartedly. It is reminiscent of the Halachah (Shulchan Aruch O.C. 287:1 and Mishnah Berurah 287:1) which states Chazal reluctantly permit the offering of condolences to mourners on Shabbat. This indicates that when such condolence is offered, it should be done sparingly. So too, Korbanot offered on Bamot should be offered sparingly, since the practice is permitted only with reluctance.",
                "A possible problem with this approach is its paucity of evidence. It is difficult to identify a source for Radak and the Metzudat David’s presumption that Bamot were permitted with great reluctance and reservation. Perhaps their source is Melachim I 3:3, which criticizes Shlomo HaMelech for offering Korbanot on Bamot, using the plural form of Bamah. Radak and the Metzudat David might draw their conclusion from the fact that the Pasuk condemns Shlomo HaMelech for offering Korbanot on multiple Bamot, as opposed to criticizing him for offering Kobanot on a Bamah or the Bamah Gedolah. It appears that the excessive amount of Bamot on which Shlomo HaMelech offered Korbanot is cause for criticism.",

Even many good kings, such as Asa and Yehoshafat, do not eliminate Bamot because the practice is so entrenched in the national culture. The people even perceive the two great kings who do attempt to rid the land from Bamot, Chikkiyahu HaMelech and Yoshiyahu HaMelech, as having sinned to Hashem for eliminating these altars (as is evident from Ravshakeh’s speech that is recorded in Melachim II 18).",
                "Bamot were permitted for decades– through the reigns of Shemuel HaNavi, Sha’ul HaMelech, and David HaMelech. It is difficult to convince people that something that was permissible to their parents, grandparents, and even great grandparents is now forbidden to them. This is especially true regarding the Bamot, since it was difficult for most of the country to travel to the Beit HaMikdash to offer Korbanot. Offering a Korban in one’s backyard is infinitely easier than having to travel to Jerusalem.",
                "Thus, even though it is technically permissible during his time, Shlomo HaMelech errs in offering Korbanot on Bamot. Shlomo HaMelech should instead think ahead and prepare the nation for when Bamot will be forbidden. Shlomo HaMelech makes quite an impression when he offers one thousand Korbanot on the Bamah Gedolah in Givon.",
                "In doing so, Shlomo HaMelech makes it even more difficult to convince the people as to the illegality of Bamot after the Beit HaMikdash is built. Offenders could now use Shlomo HaMelech, the individual responsible for the construction of the Beit HaMikdash, as precedent for offering Korbanot on Bamot. Since Shlomo HaMelech will be indelibly associated and connected with the Beit HaMikdash, he should refrain from offering Korbanot on Bamot even when the institution is not technically prohibited.",

This is certainly the case with Shlomo HaMelech’s wives. While they refrain from idolatry for a while, once Shlomo HaMelech ages, Bat Paroh and her co-wives take advantage of his weakness and revert to the idolatry of their youth.",

While high conversion standards do not guarantee positive future results, they afford the best chances for the creation of a life-long commitment to Torah. In addition, while there have been some cases of spiritual success with those who converted under weak Halachic standards, overwhelming anecdotal evidence demonstrates that the percentage of success is exponentially higher among those who have surpassed more rigorous conversion standards.",

In the time of Shlomo HaMelech, when the community’s level of observance was de rigueur, even agenda-driven converts resolved to observe Mitzvot, since this was an expected part of Jewish life. However, one can hardly assume that those who convert to marry a non-observant Jew will observe Mitzvot. If so, the conversion is missing Kabbalat Mitzvot, commitment to observe Mitzvot. This consideration adds yet another reason to adopt high standards for conversion in modern times.",

If Shlomo HaMelech actually worshipped all these deities, describing him as not fully devoted to Hashem is woefully inaccurate.

Rather, he refers to the fact that the construction occurs under Shlomo HaMelech’s auspices.

                "A cursory reading of Melachim I 12 leaves one with the impression that Rechav'am is a fool. While this certainly holds regarding how he handles his inauguration, a more careful examination reveals some exceptionally intelligent decisions and moves made by Rechav'am.",
                "<i><b>Rechav'am’s Failed Handling of the Inauguration</b></i>",
                "One need not be a trained political scientist to discern the awful mistakes Rechav'am makes during his inauguration. From his decision to convene the inauguration in the Yosef tribes’ stronghold of Shechem, to expressing a need to wait three days to make what should have been a simple decision to lower taxes, following the foolish advice of his friends to threaten to raise taxes, and finally his inexplicably poor decision to send the head of tax collection to quell the rebellion, every move he makes demonstrates his complete lack of political savvy. As a result, the northern tribes secede, and Rechav'am’s kingdom shrinks.",
                "<i><b>Rechav'am's Three Intelligent Decisions</b></i>",
                "Nonetheless, it is overly simplistic to regard Rechav'am as a fool. Rechav'am makes at least three wise decisions that decisively repudiate his status as a dunce.",
                "First, Melachim I 12:20-22 records that Rechav'am assembles a large army to preserve the union of the twelve Shevatim, much as Abraham Lincoln did when he faced the secession of southern states in 1861. However, when Shemayah the Navi instructs him to cease and desist from this effort, Rechav'am immediately complies without hesitation or dissent. Consider the great losses avoided by Rechav'am by this wise decision! More soldiers died, for instance, in the American Civil war than in the rest of all the other American military engagements combined! Rechav'am avoids untold loss of life and devastation by not pursuing a futile effort to reunite the Shevatim. Who knows how many of us Jews today would not have been born had our ancestors perished in such a terrible war. Rechav'am deserves great credit for listening to the Navi and acting in the best interest of Am Yisrael, instead of succumbing to unnecessary and foolish pride.",
                "Second, in Melachim I 14, Rechav'am is faced with an invasion by the Egyptian king Shishak. Once again, Rechav'am heeds the instruction of Shemayah the Navi (as noted in the parallel narrative recorded in Divrei HaYamim II 12) and avoids a military confrontation with the powerful Shishak. Rechav'am's restraint avoids the premature destruction of the Beit HaMikdash. As a result of his capitulation to Shishak, Rechav'am has to endure Shishak's humiliating pillage of the riches of the Beit HaMikdash and royal palace. Once again, Rechav'am places the needs of Am Yisrael ahead of his pride. Rechav'am's restraint is no small matter, especially in light of the contrasting examples in Sefer Melachim. Yoshiyahu, Yehoyakim, and Tzidkiyahu are much later Judean kings who bring about personal and national ruin due to their refusal to heed prophetic warnings to avoid a military confrontation.",
                "Finally, Divrei HaYamim II 11 describes Rechav'am's successful efforts to build and fortify the cities of Yehudah. He even manages to oversee two Shevatim defecting from the northern secession and rejoining his kingdom, Binyamin and Levi. All in all, it seems that Rechav'am is not at all a fool. Indeed, it would be utterly shocking to find the son of Shlomo Hamelech to be a complete fool. Kohelet 2:18-19, which speaks of the author’s son as a fool, speaks hypothetically and does not describe reality, as noted by Da’at Mikra ad. loc.",
                "<i><b>Explaining Rechav'am's Foolish Behavior at the Inauguration</b></i>",
                "So how do we explain Rechav'am's extraordinarily foolish behavior at his inauguration? The answer seems quite straightforward and obvious from Melachim I 12:15, “<i>VeLo Shama HaMelech El Ha’Am Ki Hayetah Sibah Mei’Im Hashem LeMa’an Hakim Et Devaro Asher Dibeir Hashem BeYad Achiyah HaShiloni El Yarav’am ben Nevat</i>,” “The king [Rechav'am] did not listen to the people for it was a design from Hashem, in order to fulfill His word that Hashem had spoken through the hand of Achiyah the Shilonite to Yarav’am the son of Nevat [to split the kingdom as a punishment to Shlomo HaMelech].”",
                "The idea that Hashem manipulates the actions of a king is hardly unique to Rechav'am. Hashem manipulates the heart of Paroh, Sichon, and even Shlomo HaMelech (to bring about the punishment accorded to the descendants of Eili the Kohein, see Melachim I 2:27). Hashem clearly manipulates the heart of Haman and Achashveirosh in Megillat Esther. Indeed, Mishlei 21:1 states “<i>Lev Melech BeYad Hashem</i>,” “the king’s heart is in the hands of Hashem.”",
                "<i><b>Modern Day Examples</b></i>",
                "There are numerous examples, even in the modern-day, of Hashem manipulating otherwise highly intelligent leaders. There have been numerous instances when foolish Arab intransigence has benefitted the Jewish State. Examples that stand out are Yasser Arafat’s rejection of Ehud Barak’s extremely generous peace offer at Camp David in 2000, and President Clinton’s even more generous proposal in December 2000, as well as Hafez al-Assad’s rejection of Barak’s offer of 99% of the Golan Heights in 1999. These proposals and the Arab rejections are documented at length with pictures of the original maps in <i>The Missing Peace</i> by Dennis Ross. The ceding of the Golan Heights specifically would have created a grave danger to Israel during the instability in Syria fifteen years after Assad’s rejection. Had the Mufti of Jerusalem accepted the 1937 Peel Partition Plan, Arabs would have controlled more than three-quarters of Eretz Yisrael. Finally, had the Arabs accepted the 1947 UN Partition Plan, the very large Arab population in the Jewish State which comprised of very large families easily would have outnumbered the Jews, and the Arabs would have assumed control of Israel by democratic means in a decade or less.",
                "Another example is noted by historian Paul Johnson (<i>Commentary Magazine</i>, May 1998):",
                "<i>Another paradoxical aspect of the Zionist miracle, which we certainly did not grasp at the time and which is insufficiently understood even now, is that among the founding fathers of Israel was Joseph Stalin. Stalin had no love for Jews; quite the contrary, he murdered them whenever it suited his purposes. In his last phase, indeed, he was becoming increasingly paranoid; had he lived, he might well have carried out an extermination program rivaling Hitler’s. Moreover, like Lenin before him, Stalin had always opposed Zionism. He did so not only as a Great Russian imperialist but as a Marxist, and he was consistent on the matter up to the end of World War II and again from 1950 to his death in 1953. But during the crucial years 1947-48, he was guided by temporary considerations of Realpolitik, and specifically by what he saw as the threat of British imperialism.</i>",
                "<i>Stalin ignorantly supposed that the way to undermine Britain’s position in the Middle East was to support the Jews, not the Arabs, and he backed Zionism in order to break the “British stranglehold.” Not only did he extend diplomatic recognition to Israel but, in order to intensify the fighting and the consequent chaos, he instructed the Czech government to sell it arms. The Czechs turned over an entire military airfield to shuttle weaponry to Tel Aviv; the Messerschmitt aircraft they supplied were of particular importance. Then, in mid-August 1948, Stalin decided he had made a huge error in judgment, and the obedient Czech government ordered a halt to the airlift within 48 hours. But by then the war had effectively been won.</i>",
                "Finally, King Hussein of Jordan was a wise leader who ruled Jordan from 1953 until his death in 1999. Hussein shrewdly overcame many existential threats to Jordan, as well as numerous assassination attempts. Israelis are fond of saying that King Hussein of Jordan made only two mistakes: attacking Israel in 1967, and refraining from invading Israel during the 1973 Yom Kippur War when Israel barely survived a two-front attack by Egypt and Syria. Israel, which was woefully unprepared for the 1973 war, likely would not have survived if it was also attacked by Jordan.",
                "This behavior is eerily reminiscent of the behavior of Nachash, the king of Ammon (note that the Jordanian capital is the ancient city of Amman), who attacks the Bnei Yisrael and is defeated during Sha’ul’s rise to power (Shemuel I 11). Nachash, however, fails to attack when Sha’ul’s forces are utterly destroyed in Shemuel I 28.",
                "<i><b>Conclusion</b></i>",
                "Unfortunately, unlike his grandfather David HaMelech, Rechav'am does not distinguish himself as a Tzadik. However, it is woefully inaccurate and superficial to characterize Rechav'am as a fool. He is a wise king, who consistently makes difficult and wise decisions, from which the Bnei Yisrael greatly benefit. His stunningly foolish decisions at his inauguration represent an aberration that emerges solely as a result of divine intervention. Indeed, a telltale sign of Hashem’s subtle hand intervening in human affairs is when an otherwise wise leader acts in an extraordinarily foolish manner. Regarding Rechav'am we may apply the words of Yeshayahu HaNavi: <i>“Meishiv Chachamim Achor VeDa’atam Yisakeil</i>,” “He [Hashem] makes wise people act foolishly” (Yeshayahu 44:25)."

                "The Mishnah (Sanhedrin 10:2) makes a stunning assertion: only three Jewish kings do not have a portion in Olam HaBa (the World to Come) — Yarav'am ben Nevat, Achav, and Menashe. Rambam (Hilchot Teshuvah 5:12) takes the Mishnah a step further and depicts Yarav'am ben Nevat as a paradigm of the worst Jew ever.

However, this is a very erroneous presumption. In fact, Yarav'am is fully justified, and even divinely mandated, to foment dissension and lead the formation of a rival kingdom in the north. As stated clearly in Melachim I 11, the Navi Achiyah HaShiloni directs Yarav'am to lead the secession. Achiyah presents the secession to Yarav'am as a non-negotiable <i>fait accompli</i>.",
                "Interestingly, the Malbim writes that Achiyah does not merely pronounce the secession, but also dramatizes it by tearing the garment to demonstrate the inevitability of the breakoff (Melachim I 11:30).

                "<i><b>Yarav'am’s Reforms</b></i>",
                "Rather, the profoundly wicked characterization of Yarav'am stems from the deviant enactments he establishes after he becomes king over the Northern Kingdom, as described in Melachim I 12:26-33. Yarav'am creates two forbidden alternatives to the Beit HaMikdash— one in Beit El and one in Dan.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yarav'am’s altar in Dan has been excavated and is available for viewing.</i> Moreover, he permits everyone, even non-Kohanim, to serve on these illicit altars. Yarav'am also makes two golden calves at the Beit El and Dan sites, and orders that Sukkot be observed on the fifteenth of Marcheshvan. According to Chazal, Yarav'am even erects barriers to prevent the northern Bnei Yisrael from visiting Yerushalayim and the Beit HaMikdash.",

Rashi notes that only Davidic royalty was permitted to sit in the Azarah (Temple courtyard). Rashi also notes that only kings from the Davidic line would read the Torah during the once in seven-year Hakheil ceremony. Thus, Yarav'am is unable to sit in the Azarah and will be perceived as an illegitimate king. This leads Yarav'am to create alternatives to the Beit HaMikdash, in order for his alternative kingdom to remain viable and survive.",
                "From a purely secular and pragmatic perspective, Yarav'am’s assessment is perceptive and astute. However, from a religious-spiritual perspective, it is completely off-base. After all, Achiyah HaShiloni promises that Yarav'am’s rule is divinely mandated and guaranteed (Melachim I 11:37). Thus, Yarav'am’s alternative altars are completely unnecessary. Furthermore, it is quite likely that Hashem orders Achiyah HaShiloni to reveal His plan to Yarav'am so that the latter does not deem it necessary to create alternative temples to protect the legitimacy of his reign. Unfortunately, Yarav'am does not get the message. We make similar potentially disastrous mistakes when we fail to balance our pragmatic calculations with the values expressed in the Torah.",
                "Tragically, Yarav'am is so obsessed with his honor and prestige of position, that he is unable to refrain from creating these alternative centers. The Gemara (Sanhedrin 102a) presents Yarav'am’s calculations most dramatically:",

Yarav'am said to Him: Who will walk in the lead? Hashem said to Yarav'am: The son of Yishai will walk in the lead.

Yarav'am is promised by Achiyah that his kingdom will last forever if he honors the words of the Torah. Granted, he would have played a secondary role in the Beit HaMikdash, but his rule would have been preserved. We could and should have remained one people with one Torah, with one religious center in Yerushalayim, under two political entities. Tragically, as a result of his pursuit of honor, every male in Yarav'am’s line is eventually eliminated by Ba’asha, and the Northern Kingdom is led down a spiritually ruinous path.",

We suggest that he follows the pattern set by Paroh, as explained by Ramban (Shemot 1:10), who did not immediately introduce the full oppression of our ancestors.",
                "Rather, Paroh gradually introduced the changes, so that the Egyptian populace would accept them. Hitler, may his evil name be blotted out, used the same strategy. He did not introduce the murderous concentration camps upon his election in 1933. Rather, he slowly habituated the German populace to degrading and oppressing the Jewish nation. It is reasonable to assume that Yarav'am also gradually introduces his reforms slowly and steadily, to the point when the Bnei Yisrael eventually accept them. As shocking as it is to learn that a large portion of the Bnei Yisrael actually accept Yarav'am’s radical moves, such is the potential power of a charismatic leader who leads his followers down a path of self-destruction.",

Yarav'am entirely unnecessary reforms lead to the loss of the northern Bnei Yisrael’s Jewish identity. In other words, Yarav'am ben Nevat initiates the process that leads to the loss of the Jewish identity of approximately half of Am Yisrael. It is difficult to think of someone who inflicted as much spiritual damage as Yarav'am ben Nevat did to Am Yisrael. Chazal teach that Yarav'am began as a Torah scholar (Sanhedrin 102a). Unfortunately, due to his desire to preserve his honor, he led so many astray from the Torah. Thus, we understand why Rambam classifies Yarav'am as “the worst Rasha ever.”",

Each of these movements enjoyed great success for a while, but eventually succumbed or is deep into the process of succumbing to the dustbin of history. It is proven time and time again that only profound reverence for and thorough commitment to the traditions of Am Yisrael preserves the Jewish identity for the long term. For example, it is well known that in 1988, when the Reform movement’s flagship Temple Emanuel of New York celebrated its one-hundredth birthday, it sought to identify and invite the descendants of its founders. To their surprise and chagrin, they discovered that not a single descendant of the original members continued to identify as Jewish.",

The question then emerges as to why Hashem orchestrates no less than six open miracles (Nissim Geluyim; violations of the laws of nature) in what appears to be an effort to dissuade Yarav'am ben Nevat from his path of serious deviation from the Torah way. Why does Yarav'am, more than almost any other Rasha, deserve such special treatment, and “merit” such an effort from Hashem?",
                "One answer might be that Yarav'am is a Rasha poised to cause damage on an unprecedented scale. His “reforms,” as we explained earlier, set the Northern Kingdom on a path that will cut them off from Jewish eternity.

Eight tribes are eventually lead astray and lost to Am Yisrael primarily due to the policies and projects of the misguided Yarav'am. It is a juncture of enormous import, and through His unprecedented intervention, Hashem offers incontrovertible evidence and motivation for Yarav'am to change his path.

Ralbag adds that by not eating, the Ish Elokim from Yehudah communicates that there is no benefit to be derived from the Northern Kingdom since they and their institutions will all eventually perish and face utter destruction. In other words, the Ish Elokim sends a message by refraining from eating: if the Northern Kingdom maintains its current path, it is destined to become an Ir HaNidachat (wayward city, see Devarim 13). The Ish Elokim, in turn, treats Yarav'am’s kingdom as if it is already an Ir HaNidachat.",

Indeed, the false prophet tells the Ish Elokim<i> “Gam Ani Navi Kamocha,”</i> “I am also a prophet like you” (Melachim I 13:18).

In addition, he does actually receive a Nevu’ah during this episode. This was necessary because, as noted by theMalbim (Melachim I 13:20), someone needs to tell over the real reason for the unusual death of the Ish Elokim. Ralbag (Melachim I 13:18) explains that it is necessary for the Ish Elokim to hear the Mussar (rebuke) from the Navi Sheker. Ralbag compares Hashem’s communication with the false Navi to His placing of His spirit upon Bila’am to present an important message that requires Bila’am’s conveyance (BeMidbar 22). </i> After all, the true “villain” of the story is the false Navi who misleads the Ish Elokim.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Binyamin Jachter notes that is possible that the Navi is an actual Navi that has not received Nevu’ah for years. By bringing the Ish Elokim near him, the old Navi hopes to regain his Nevu’ah, as seen by Sha’ul (Shemuel I 9:10-11). Proximity to a Navi can trigger Nevu’ah.

However, Ralbag notes that the comparison is erroneous since, at the Akeidah, the Malach merely explains the original communication from Hashem. The Malach explains that “VeHa’aleihu,” “and offer him” (part of the initial instruction, see BeReishit 22:2) refers to only placing Yitzchak on the Mizbei’ach, but not to actually slaughter and offer him as a Korban. In Melachim I 13, however, the Navi Sheker “communicates” a complete reversal of Hashem’s directive, something that Hashem would never do. “Lo Yachalif HaKeil VeLo Yamir Dato,” “Hashem will never amend nor exchange His law for any other”— one of the thirteen principles of faith is that Hashem does not change His Mitzvot. </i> but why does he deserve to meet such a horrible death?",
                "Ralbag answers that the false Navi and the rest of northern Israel are so bad that Hashem completely disengages from them and does not even bother punishing them. Only those on a higher level deserve the attention from Hashem to be punished.

Only the Jews that retain complete fidelity to Hashem’s Mitzvot survive as Jews in the long term. The eventual spiritual demise of the Bnei Yisrael of the Northern Kingdom is the first example of this phenomenon in our history. Many of the Jews of the Southern Kingdom remain as Jews even after their exile from Eretz Yisrael. This is not at all the case regarding the Bnei Yisrael of the Northern Kingdom. The difference lies in the fact that the northern Bnei Yisrael at first deviate from Mitzvot and then eventually slide into idolatry in later generations.

It was a warning heeded by pious Jews throughout the centuries and millennia. For example, it served as a reminder to Am Yisrael to withstand the pressure of those members of the Christian community who struggled mightily and in vain to convince Am Yisrael that Hashem had, Chas VeShalom, changed His mind and presented a “New Testament.” During the early and mid-twentieth century in North America, the story served as succor and support for those who clung to Orthodox Judaism even at a time when Reform and Conservative Judaism were on the rise, and the demise of Orthodox Judaism loomed large. However, by the end of the twentieth century, the faithful were vindicated, as the deviationist groups begin to collapse, and the Orthodox community had made considerable progress to be restored to its former greatness.",

VaYedabru Ba’Ir and VaYineihu) explain the stunning scene of the lion and the donkey at the end of Melachim I 13 as a means to clarify beyond any reasonable doubt that the Ish Elokim’s death is not happenstance, but rather conveys a message of profound importance from Hashem. Ralbag explains that Hashem hopes that Yarav'am will derive a lesson and change his ways. We suggest that Hashem has little hope for Yarav'am, as noted by Ralbag (Melachim I 13:9). Rather, the message is primarily directed to the Jews of the south to hold firm, and not follow the example of their brethren in the Northern Kingdom. The terrible outcome of the Ish Elokim from Yehudah serves as a potent warning to Am Yisrael to not follow in the deviationist manner of the Northern Kingdom.",

The Jew is eternal. He is the embodiment of eternity.\" Tolstoy is completely correct in his evaluation of our people. Our survival as a people is a miracle that occurs because we are bearers of the prophetic tradition. Therefore, only those who faithfully bear the prophetic tradition merit to be included in this miraculous survival in the long term. Melachim I 13 makes this point abundantly clear in the starkest terms possible.",
                "Melachim I 13 concludes that Yarav'am stubbornly resists the messages conveyed throughout the entire chapter. May we have the wisdom and intellectual/emotional fortitude and honesty to not follow in the footsteps of Yarav'am ben Nevat."

                "<i><b>The Inscription</b></i>",
                "On the southern wall of the impressive temple of Amon in Karnak, Egypt, is an inscription about the military campaigns of King Shishak, a Pharaoh of Libyan origin who ruled between 935-914 BCE. The inscription describes a heavy military blow dealt to tens of cities both in the Southern and Northern Kingdoms of Israel, ruled at that point by Rechav'am ben Shlomo and Yarav’am ben Nevat, respectively.",
                "Archeologists have been puzzled as to why Shishak would attack his friend Yarav’am, as Sefer Melachim records that Shishak shelters Yarav’am during his years of exile (Melachim I 11:40). Moreover, why does Tanach record only Shishak’s attack on the Southern Kingdom (Melachim I 14:25-28), and not his attacks on the Northern Kingdom?",
                "<i><b>Rejection of Potential Solutions</b></i>",
                "Contradictions between Tanach and archaeological evidence can sometimes be resolved by questioning the validity of the archaeological evidence. Ancient kings recorded their own version of their achievements and were hardly objective historians. They were loath to record their failings, and sometimes exaggerated their victories. Thus, one could in theory argue that Shishak inflated his exploits in Eretz Yisrael, and recorded that he invaded northern Israel when in fact he did not. This, however, is not a viable approach, since part of a stele (monument) celebrating Shishak’s victory in northern Israel was discovered in Megiddo, a strategically-located fortress in Israel’s Yizre’el Valley.",
                "Another approach can be based on the fact that Tanach, simply put, is not a history book. Sefer Melachim, for example, often refers to the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah or the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These lost sources should not be confused with Divrei HaYamim in Tanach, which was written during the Second Temple period.</i> for a full description of the lives of the various kings it discusses. Thus, one could argue that Tanach does not record Shishak’s invasion of northern Israel simply because it does not seek to present a full description of all the events that occurred during Yarav’am ben Nevat’s reign.",
                "This approach is also unsound because our problem is not simply Tanach’s <i>omission </i>of Shishak’s invasion of northern Israel. Our fundamental problem is that Tanach presents Shishak as a <i>friend </i>of Yarav’am ben Nevat, but the inscription on the Karnak temple presents Shishak as his enemy.",

                "Professor Yehuda Elitzur, a highly-respected Orthodox Jewish Bible scholar, presents an interesting theory to resolve this problem.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Dr. Elitzur’s Hebrew language essay on this topic appears on the website of Israel’s Herzog College; we include part of Rabbi Alex Israel’s presentation of Dr. Elitzur’s approach in an English language essay that appears on the website of Yeshivat Har Etzion. </i> He suggests that Shishak anticipates that Yarav’am will ally with him in his attack of Rechav'am’s Yehudah region, after Yarav’am leads the secession of the northern ten Shevatim from Rechav'am’s kingdom (Melachim I 12). The plan is orchestrated as a joint military campaign.",
                "However, Rechav'am (on prophetic advice from Shemayah the Navi; see Melachim I 12 and Divrei HaYamim II 12) resists avenging Yarav’am's rebellion and acquiesces to the split of his kingdom (see Melachim I 12:22-24). After Rechav'am's lack of hostility, Yarav’am can hardly muster popular support for an attack on Yehudah. He has no reason or motive to attack; he is ironically beholden to Rechav’am for his kingdom.",
                "Moreover, Yarav’am understands that he dare not force his subjects to fight an unpopular war. Yarav’am knows that the northern tribes’ secession derived from Shlomo HaMelech overburdening the people with unpopular building projects. Thus, he cannot afford to ignore public sentiment, as public sentiment is what put him in a position of power in the first place. In general, new regimes, as opposed to well-established dynasties, must be particularly sensitive to public sentiment.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As noted by TABC alumnus Jeremy Doberman (‘06).</i>",
                "Hence, Professor Elitzur suggests that Yarav’am lets Shishak down by abandoning their collective plan to decimate Yehudah. Yarav’am refuses to go to war against Yehudah. As a response, Shishak unleashes his fury against Yehudah (and plunders the wealth accumulated by Shlomo HaMelech, as recorded both in Sefer Melachim and the inscription at Karnak), but fails to strike a knockout blow to the Southern Kingdom. He harms them, but does not destroy them. His real fury is channeled against Yarav’am’s kingdom, who betrays him by backtracking on their previous agreement.",
                "This explains some of the politics. Still, it leaves us with a further question: Why is the attack on Yarav’am’s kingdom not even mentioned in Tanach?",
                "The depiction of the conflict in Sefer Melachim is ahistorical, as if it deliberately omits the great military events, and puts the entire emphasis upon the Beit HaMikdash. The most reasonable explanation to solve this problem is that the purpose of the transmission of the story is not to report historical events, however important they may be, but to teach spiritual lessons.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Professor Avraham Grossman of Hebrew University is a proponent of this theory.</i> It appears that the Tanach understands historical events within the context of its conception of reward and punishment. Shishak's attack on Yerushalayim is described because it punishes the people of Yehudah for their idolatry (see Melachim I 14:22-26).",
                "A variation of this approach is that Tanach records Shishak’s attack on Yerushalayim not only to record the punishment for Yehudah’s idolatry, but also to celebrate Rechav'am’s wise and righteous decisions in heeding the advice of Shemayah the Navi, avoiding a civil war with Yarav’am ben Nevat, and yielding to the power of Shishak. By doing so, Rechav'am avoids the premature destruction of the Beit HaMikdash. This contrasts sharply with later kings of Yehudah, such as Yoshiyahu, Yehoyakim, and Tzidkiyahu, who eventually end up losing the Beit HaMikdash for their failure to obey the directives of Yirmiyahu HaNavi to avoid confrontation with a superpower (as recorded in Sefer Melachim and Sefer Yirmiyahu).",
                "Moreover, it teaches that Shlomo HaMelech’s ill-advised alliance with Paroh leads to the near destruction of the Beit HaMikdash, and the loss of much of his accumulated wealth. Shishak, the founder of a new Egyptian dynasty (see Radak and Da’at Mikra to Melachim I 11:40), views Shlomo as an enemy, since Shlomo was a friend of his enemy, the previous Paroh.",
                "However, Shishak’s invasion of the Northern Kingdom only damages, rather than destroys, Yarav’am’s kingdom. Since Yarav’am is portrayed as a wicked man of the highest order, perhaps Sefer Melachim does not mention Shishak’s damage to northern Israel because it does not represent adequate punishment for Yarav’am’s misdeeds, whereas Shishak’s damage of Yehudah is recorded since it represents adequate punishment for their idolatry. Sefer Melachim does record the destruction of all of the males of Yarav’am’s family, since this is a just consequence of his evil actions.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\">TABC alumnus Jared Mayer (‘13) notes that this phenomenon is somewhat similar to the Halachic principle of Kam Lei BiDeRabah Mineih; meaning, if one performed two sins simultaneously, Beit Din administers only the harsher punishment. Similarly, Tanach only records the harsher punishment meted out by Hashem to Yarav’am.</i>",
                "It is possible, though, that Sefer Melachim alludes to the conflict between Yarav’am and Shishak. In its concluding statement about Yarav’am (Melachim I 14:18), it refers to the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel that describes the events and the battles fought by Yarav’am. The parallel concluding statement about Rechav’am (Melachim I 14:29) refers to a full recounting of Rechav’am’s life events in the Chronicles of the Kings of Yehudah, but not to the battles he fought. The difference might emerge from the fact that Yarav’am confronted Shishak, whereas Rechav’am was passive and did not fight back.",
                "<i><b>An Alternative to Professor Elitzur’s Approach</b></i>",
                "We suggest an alternative to Professor Elitzur’s reconstruction of the relationship between Shishak and Yarav’am ben Nevat. One should hardly be shocked at a king attacking a former ally. Many have observed that “nations have no permanent allies, only permanent interests.” Adolf Hitler’s (Yemach Shemo, may his name be erased) alliance with Joseph Stalin (Yemach Shemo) to jointly invade Poland in 1939, and the Nazis’ subsequent invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 is one well-known illustration of this behavior. Hitler allied with Stalin when he felt it was in his interest to do so, and then attacked him when he felt it was in his best interest to do so.",
                "Shishak wishes to plunder the wealth Shlomo HaMelech accumulates in Yerushalayim. Shishak, however, fears attacking a united (and therefore mighty) Israel. Shishak determines that his only hope to take the gold is to weaken Israel by supporting Yarav’am ben Nevat, who is determined to split Israel into two kingdoms. Thus, Shishak shelters Yarav’am when the latter escapes from Shlomo HaMelech, since Yarav’am’s revolt will facilitate the achievement of his goals in the south.",
                "However, once Shishak plunders the Southern Kingdom’s gold, his alliance with Yarav’am becomes entirely unnecessary. Instead, Shishak sets his sights on the Yizre’el Valley, which runs through Yarav’am’s kingdom, since the international trade route between Egypt and Mesopotamia runs through this valley. One who controls the trade route has the ability to increase his wealth, and this seems to be Shishak’s goal. Shishak is easily able to defeat Yarav’am’s kingdom and assume control of the international trade route, since the once united and mighty Israelite nation is now split and weakened. Indeed, the inscription on the Karnak temple mentions many key Yizre’el Valley locations attacked by Shishak, such as Megiddo and Beit She’an.",

                "Understood properly, the archaeological record regarding Shishak hardly undermines the Tanach. Instead, it specifically augments our understanding of the events described and alluded to by Sefer Melachim, and enriches our appreciation of the goals of Sefer Melachim when we learn of the events the divinely inspired Navi chose not to include in Sefer Melachim."

                "Regarding Asa, the text does not use the fact that he does not remove the Bamot to detract from his status as a righteous king. Melachim I 15:11 compares Asa to David HaMelech. Then, Melachim I 15:14 mentions Asa’s failure to remove the Bamot. Nevertheless, Sefer Melachim’s summary of Asa’s reign concludes that “Asa’s heart was whole with Hashem all his days.” Thus, Sefer Melachim overall characterizes Asa as a righteous ruler.",
                "However, in its summary of Yehoshafat’s reign, after it praises him for “doing that which was proper in the eyes of Hashem” (Melachim I 22:43), Sefer Melachim criticizes Yehoshafat for his failure to remove the Bamot (Melachim I 22:44). Unlike its treatment of Asa’s reign, Sefer Melachim does not close its summary of Yehoshafat’s reign with a positive spiritual evaluation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\">While Melachim I 22:45 does mention that “Yehoshafat made peace with the king of Israel (Achav),” this cannot be interpreted as praise. As is clear from the rest of Sefer Melachim, Yehoshafat’s alliance with Achav is a dismal failure, as it results in the greater influence of Avodah Zarah in the Yehudah region. The alliance with Achav is formed via the marriage of Yehoshafat’s son Yehoram to Achav’s daughter Ataliah. Yehoram Melech Yehudah is negatively influenced by his wife Ataliah and breaks a streak of sixty-six years of righteous kings. See the later chapter, “Two Tales of Yehoshafat,” for a larger discussion of the outcome of this marriage. Additionally, while the rest of Melachim I 22 does relate more of Yehoshafat’s interactions, it does not explicitly evaluate any of them in spiritual terms.</i> This difference in structure serves to subtly critique Yehoshafat for his failure to remove the Bamot from Yehudah. Additionally, the Navi’s usage of the word “<i>Ach</i>,” “but,” in his description of Yehoshafat’s failure comes to limit the previous accolade’s reach. No such coordinating conjunction is used in the Sefer’s summary of Asa’s reign.",
                "We suggest that the Navi hints at some criticism of Yehoshafat since it was ripe in his time to remove the Bamot from Yehudah. In other words, Asa correctly assesses that his reign is not the proper time to eliminate the Bamot. Yehoshafat, though, misses out on a golden opportunity to finally rid his jurisdiction of Bamot without engendering a negative backlash. The people of Yehudah are ready to take their spirituality to the next level. Unfortunately, Yehoshafat fails to capitalize on the moment.",
                "Unfortunately, Yehoshafat’s son Yehoram does not follow in his father and grandfather’s path of devotion to Hashem. While Yehoram’s marriage to Izevel, the daughter of evil northern king Acahav, plays a major role in his spiritual deterioration, perhaps his father’s failure to eliminate the Bamot also plays a role. As the Ba’alei Mussar teach, one must aspire to ascend in one’s service of Hashem. If an individual does not make an effort to spiritually advance, he will inevitably regress. Yehoshafat’s failure to advance in his devotion to Hashem leads to a serious regression in the next generation, as demonstrated by Yehoram’s dismal reign.",
                "<i><b>Conclusion</b></i>",
                "Asa, although not sufficiently recognized as such, is one of the all-time great Jews who are responsible for the preservation of Torah fidelity and observance. He makes the wise move for his time to not launch a campaign to rid Yehudah of Bamot, and instead restricts and focuses his efforts on the elimination of idolatry. His son Yehoshafat, though devout in his observance, pays a steep price for failing to advance his father’s cause when he does not remove the Bamot during his reign. “<i>Ma’alin BaKodesh VeLo Moridim</i>,” “one rises in holiness and does not descend.” We must always grow in our commitment to Hashem and His Torah, and never be satisfied with merely maintaining the spiritual status quo."

        "Eliyahu HaNavi and the Drought of Faith": {
            "Eliyahu HaNavi is Fed by Ravens": [
                "<i><b>Introduction</b></i>",
                "At the beginning of Melachim I 17, Eliyahu HaNavi swears that no rain or dew will fall throughout northern Israel. After this proclamation, Hashem tells him to go hide in the Nachal Kerit, near the Yarden, and that He has commanded the ravens to bring him food (Melachim I 17:2-6).",
                "Ravens appear on the list of twenty-four non-kosher species of birds. Moreover, Tehillim 147:9 states “<i>Notein LiVeheima Lachmah, LiVnei Oreiv Asher Yikera’u</i>,” “He gives to an animal its food, to young ravens that cry out.” Ravens are characterized as cruel creatures that do not even sustain their own young, leaving them crying for food. Why, then, out of all the means to sustain Eliyahu HaNavi, does Hashem choose to send ravens to feed him?",
                "<i><b>Radak’s Approach</b></i>",
                "Radak cites the opinions of those who understand the Hebrew word Oreivim, not as ravens, but as people from the town known as Oreiv. This seems to be a bit of a stretch. Indeed, the mainstream opinion is that it refers to ravens.",
                "<i><b>Rashi and the Alshich’s Approach</b></i>",
                "Rashi and the Alshich view this incident as Hashem’s indication to Eliyahu HaNavi that the latter acts too harshly in stopping the rain. Eliyahu HaNavi, in bringing about the terrible drought, demands from Hashem that He hew closer to Middat HaDin, strict judgment. After all, the Northern Kingdom has quickly become entrapped in a web of Avodah Zarah and requires extraction. Eliyahu HaNavi feels that the cessation of rain will hold the northern Bnei Yisrael accountable for their Avodah Zarah, and in turn, bring them back to the proper path.",
                "Hashem, in essence, exiles Eliyahu HaNavi to Nachal Kerit and places him in solitary confinement. The only contact he has with any living creature is his twice a day interaction with the ravens. By sending the non-kosher and cruel ravens, Hashem communicates to Eliyahu HaNavi that he is acting like a raven.",
                "<i><b>A New Suggested Approach</b></i>",
                "One may suggest a variation on the approach of Rashi and the Alshich. One may argue that the Oreiv does not represent Eliyahu HaNavi, but rather Achav. By leading (or permitting his wife to lead) the northern Bnei Yisrael to the clutches of Avodah Zarah, Achav acts in a non-kosher and cruel manner. Hashem communicates to Eliyahu HaNavi, that even a raven, a non-kosher and cruel bird, can be a source of positivity. If a raven can bring about something positive, so too, if properly engaged, Achav can bring about something positive. Hashem, according to this approach, tries to nudge Eliyahu HaNavi away from the extremely tough posture he has adopted towards Achav (i.e. stopping the rain). A softer and more effective approach might bring forth better spiritual results from Achav. This approach may be supported by the Gemara (Sanhedrin 113a, cited by Radak), which states that the meat and bread brought by the ravens originated from Achav’s kitchen. This underscores the message that something positive may emerge from Achav.",
                "Moreover, these are presumably kosher provisions. If Achav’s kitchen is the source of the meat and bread, then, according to this opinion in the Midrash, Achav maintains a kosher kitchen!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The dissenting opinion apparently finds this unfathomable. The dissenting view argues that the food came from Yehoshafat, the righteous king of Malchut Yehudah. Achav is seen as completely alienated from Torah and not someone who maintains a kosher kitchen. Both opinions agree that meat was to be found only at a royal table during the time of extreme drought.</i> This would imply that Achav is not completely alienated from Torah and that if properly engaged, he can find his way back to Torah.",
                "<i><b>Tzimtzum - Why Hashem Does Not End the Drought</b></i>",
                "If Hashem objects to the famine, why does He not simply put an end to the famine? Why does He merely nudge Eliyahu to end it? With or without Eliyahu HaNavi’s consent, Hashem can end the drought!",
                "On a simple level, one could argue that this would severely compromise and even undermine Eliyahu HaNavi’s mission. Eliyahu HaNavi announces that the famine will only end by his proclamation after the Northern Kingdom refrains from Avodah Zarah. If Hashem ends the famine early, Eliyahu HaNavi will be labeled a Navi Sheker. Even worse, since Eliyahu HaNavi calls everyone to task for idolatry, if the famine ends without an end to idolatry (or at least by Eliyahu HaNavi’s proclamation), then the drought will not be attributed to the Bnei Yisrael’s rampant Avodah Zarah. This, in turn, will fuel a resurgence in the Bnei Yisrael’s adoption of Izevel’s idolatrous ways.",
                "A second and more fundamental answer emerges from the Kabbalistic concept of Tzimtzum, divine self-contraction. The masters of Kabbalah teach that Hashem contracted, limited, and condensed Himself to enable the existence of the world. Hashem is infinite and must contract Himself to enable the existence of any other entity. He must also engage in Tzimtzum to grant human beings free will.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">67</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Meshech Chochmah (BeReishit 1:26) uses the idea of Tzimtzum to resolve the classic paradox of human free will and divine foreknowledge. </i> Thus, Hashem will often send us signals to nudge us to better behavior; but, if we engage in counterproductive action, He will not necessarily prevent us from doing so.",
                "Thus, we find that Hashem allows Eliyahu to exercise his free will. He nudges Eliyahu HaNavi to change course but chooses to limit Himself and not override Eliyahu HaNavi. This as an expression of the Gemara’s teaching, that “<i>BaDerech SheAdam Rotzheh Leileich Bah, Molichin Oto</i>,” “along the path a person wishes to proceed, one leads and assists him” (Makkot 10b).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As noted by TABC alumnus Avi Baer ('19).</i> Hashem will help a person attain his goal whatever his path may be, whether it leads to good or bad.",

It should be noted that only Moshe Rabbeinu had constant and instant access to Hashem. Other Nevi’im’s communications with Hashem were only (national) need-based and exceedingly rare. For example, it appears from the Chumash that Hashem speaks with Avraham Avinu only a handful of times. Thus, Eliyahu HaNavi has to discover the identity of the woman through more natural means. </i> Eliyahu HaNavi follows in the footsteps of Eliezer, Avraham Avinu’s servant, who also is sent to unfamiliar territory in search of a woman and does not know how to identify her (BeReishit 24). Just as Eliezer discovers the correct woman by asking to be fed, so too Eliyahu discovers which woman is supposed to feed him by asking to be fed.",
                "Rashi’s approach is supported by Chazal’s important principle that “<i>Megalgelim Zechut Al Yedei Zakkai,” </i>“merit is engendered by means of the innocent” (Shabbat 32a). Hashem brings about good things through good people. If this woman, Eliyahu HaNavi reasons, is willing to share food despite her desperate situation, then she is likely the good person that Hashem has chosen to bring about good things and feed him.",

                "<i>There was a very poor man whose wife had died after having given birth to a child. The widower became frantic, as he had no financial resources to hire a wet nurse to feed the baby. Hashem, though, made a miracle, and the husband began to lactate. R.

The Kabbalah teaches that order for there to be an “<i>Itaruta DeLi’eilah</i>,” “awakening from above,” there must also be an “<i>Itaruta DeLetata</i>,” “awakening from below.” In other words, Hashem cedes control (Tzimtzum, as discussed in the previous chapter) to us, to the effect that He allows us to trigger His responses.",
                "This idea is ubiquitous in Torah and Torah life. For example, the Gemara (Sotah 37a) famously describes that the Yam Suf did not split until Nachshon ben Aminadav first jumped into the sea. In daily life, we are familiar with the Shulchan Aruch’s recommendation to give Tzedakah in the context of our Tefillah (Y.D. 249:14). Our exhibition of kindness by giving Tzedakah during Tefillah inspires Hashem to act kindly towards us.",
                " The Gemara (Bava Kama 92a) encourages praying for others before our needs and posits that doing so will result in an answered prayer. When we show kindness to others, it creates a climate in which Hashem is more inclined to exhibit kindness to us. In fact, one may view the enterprise of Tefillah as one of “<i>Itaruta DeLetata</i>.” We often wonder why we pray if Hashem will do whatever He wishes. The response is that Hashem chooses to wait for us to trigger His actions.",
                "Ralbag explains that to merit the miracle of the unceasing flour and oil, the Almanah has to first share her food with Eliyahu HaNavi. Eliyahu HaNavi, accordingly, teaches the Almanah the aforementioned concept. To trigger the incredible miracle, the Almanah must first perform a great act of kindness.",
                "Ralbag may draw support from Melachim I 17:9, in which Hashem tells Eliyahu HaNavi that the Almanah will sustain him. This statement is difficult in light of the fact that she has hardly anything to eat, and when Eliyahu HaNavi does come, she and Eliyahu HaNavi eat only due to the miracle of the unending flour and oil. How could this be understood as the Almanah supporting Eliyahu HaNavi?",
                "Based on Ralbag’s explanation, we may answer that the Almanah triggers the oil and flour miracle by feeding Eliyahu HaNavi during their initial encounter. Thus, the Almanah sustains Eliyahu HaNavi. After all, she is the one who triggers the miracle, not Eliyahu HaNavi.",

                "The answer appears to emerge from the principle that “<i>Nikarim Divrei Emet</i>,” one can intuitively discern the truth (Sotah 9b). It seems that the Almanah intuits that Eliyahu HaNavi is an authentic Ish Elokim, even though she has no objective means of knowing the veracity of her intuition.",

This is especially so regarding a woman’s ability to discern and assess a personality. Chazal (Berachot 10b) articulate that a woman discerns and assesses the personality of a guest more keenly than does a man. Thus, the Almanah can properly assess Eliyahu HaNavi’s character.

He does not intend to present Avodah Zarah as a viable option (similar to Yehoshua during his farewell address, where he rhetorically asks whether we wish to serve Hashem or, LeHavdil, Avodah Zarah).",
                "However, what is far more troubling is the fact that Eliyahu HaNavi is teaching that serving Hashem only partially is comparable to not serving Hashem at all. This appears quite shocking and even runs counter to a basic assumption that most Jews make, that Torah living is not “all or nothing.” A recurring theme often articulated by Kiruv organizations such as Chabad and Aish HaTorah, is that Torah observance is not all or nothing.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">82</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One could simply answer that Eliyahu HaNavi is merely using provocative language to induce Bnei Yisrael to “buy into” his confrontation with the Nevi’ei HaBa’al. </i>",
                "<i><b>Newfound Association vs. Decline</b></i><b><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">83</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As developed by TABC alumnus Seth Maza (‘19). </i></b>",
                "Kiruv organizations primarily address individuals who are generations removed from full Torah observance. It is far more acceptable to attempt to raise people from a complete lack of observance to some level of Torah adherence. Eliyahu HaNavi, by contrast, addresses a generation that is shifting from a singular relationship with Hashem (albeit with the tragic deviations introduced by Yarav’am ben Nevat) to a dual allegiance to Hashem and Ba’al. Eliyahu HaNavi likens this audience’s partial allegiance to Hashem to a complete abandonment of Hashem.",
                "This approach fits with the approach articulated by Rav Avraham Pam. Rav Pam compares this mixed allegiance to Hashem at the time of Eliyahu HaNavi to the Conservative Jewish movement in the 1960s and 1970s. Rav Pam notes that the Conservative movement in a way was more of a threat than a Christian Church. The generation of American Jews who grew up in nominally Orthodox homes would never dream of intermarrying or affiliating with a Christian group. However, they would affiliate with a movement whose observance consisted of a mixture of traditional Jewish worship with contemporary American values and mores (such as mixed-gender seating). With studies of American Jews showing a higher than seventy percent intermarriage rate among those raised in the non-Orthodox movements, it is clear that the non-Orthodox movements for most American Jews are a step in the direction of an eventual complete abandonment of Jewish belief. Thus, in the long run, for a certain demographic, the Conservative movement was more dangerous than institutions that reflect a complete abandonment of Hashem.",
                "The Jews of Eliyahu HaNavi’s generation abhor a service of complete Ba’al and Asheirah. However, a mixed service of Hashem and Ba’al is palatable to them. Thus, a mixture of Hashem and Ba’al represents a far greater threat than pure Ba’al worship. It is for this reason that Eliyahu HaNavi compares mixed service of Ba’al and Hashem to the complete abandonment of Hashem in favor of Ba’al.",
                "<i><b>Total Commitment</b></i><b><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">84</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As developed by TABC alumnus Gabe Gerzberg (‘19).</i></b>",
                "An alternative approach is that Eliyahu HaNavi is communicating to every generation that they must be fully committed to Hashem. We question Eliyahu HaNavi’s “all or nothing” statement based on the presumption that some allegiance to Hashem is preferable to no allegiance to Hashem. To use a business analogy, someone who loans his friend one hundred dollars would prefer to receive fifty dollars in payment than nothing at all.",
                "However, our relationship with Hashem is not based on mere compliance and obedience. A relationship, as opposed to compliance with a loan payment agreement, is meaningless without full commitment. Our commitment to Hashem is compared in Shir HaShirim (and elsewhere in Tanach) to a relationship between spouses. Any reasonable spouse finds it completely unacceptable for his or her partner to be less than completely devoted to their marriage. Partial spousal devotion is equivalent to a complete lack of spousal devotion. Eliyahu HaNavi teaches that a mixture of devotion to Hashem and Ba’al is equivalent to having no commitment to Hashem at all.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">85</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Similarly, a conversion candidate who is willing to accept the Torah except for one detail is not accepted as a convert (Bechorot 30b). Also, one who wishes to be designated as a Chaveir (fully observant Jew) must be completely devoted without exception to Hashem’s laws (ibid). Haran is the quintessential example of one who is half-hearted in his devotion to Hashem. Haran (BeReishit Rabbah 38:13) witnesses Avraham Avinu’s confrontation with Nimrod and is unsure of whom to support– his brother or Nimrod. He decides that if Avraham emerges unscathed, he will tell Nimrod that he supports Avraham. If Avraham dies, he will support Nimrod. Avraham is thrown into the furnace and emerges unscathed. When Nimrod demands that Haran pledge his allegiance, he says that he supports his brother. They throw Haran into the furnace, and he burns to death. Why does Hashem not save Haran, as He saves Avraham minutes before from Nimrod’s fire? After all, Haran does express his support for Avraham. The answer is that Haran hardly deserves a miracle due to the shallow nature of his commitment, which is immediately preceded by an expression of agnosticism. Hashem expects unwavering commitment, just as a spouse demands and deserves unconditional loyalty, not one born simply of crass opportunism.</i>",
                "<i><b>Conclusion – All In for Hashem!</b></i>",
                "Any serious endeavor in life demands full devotion. An employer does not tolerate the partial devotion of an employee. One who is not fully devoted to his business will soon find his business failing. Even a sports coach will dismiss a talented player who is not fully devoted to his team. The lesson that emerges from Eliyahu HaNavi’s sharp rebuke to the Bnei Yisrael gathered at Har HaCarmel is for all Jews to energize their devotion to Hashem to at least the same level of commitment one shows towards a business enterprise. If we cannot show the same level of dignity to our Avodat Hashem as we do to a sports team, it is unlikely that our Torah observance will stand the test of time."

                "On Har HaCarmel, Eliyahu HaNavi challenges the Nevi’ei Ha’Ba’al to prove the authenticity of their god. Eliyahu HaNavi will offer one bull and call out to Hashem, and the Nevi’ei HaBa’al will offer the other and call out to their god. Whichever god responds with fire will be deemed the true God (Melachim I 18:24). There is, however, an apparent contradiction in the Pesukim that describe the Nevi’ei HaBa’al’s execution of Eliyahu HaNavi’s directive.",

                "Radak’s second approach is that the “giver” in Melachim I 18:26 does not refer to Eliyahu HaNavi, but rather to Achav who, according to this approach, serves as the referee or master of ceremonies at Har HaCarmel.",
                "<i><b>The Fantastic Midrash Cited by Rashi</b></i>",
                "Rashi, however, cites the Midrash (BeMidbar Rabbah 23:9), as is his wont, to solve the problem in the text. The Midrash states that the word “he” in the phrase “that he gave them” actually refers to Eliyahu HaNavi, and that Eliyahu actually hands them the bull. Indeed, the last person mentioned in Melachim I 18:25 is Eliyahu HaNavi, leading us to conclude that he is the antecedent to the pronoun “he” in Melachim I 18:26.",
                "The Midrash then tells quite a story. It explains that the bull is first chosen by the Nevi’ei HaBa’al, but then runs away to Eliyahu HaNavi, crying that it refuses to be sacrificed for Avodah Zarah. Eliyahu HaNavi then comforts the bull by telling it that it should allow itself to be slaughtered by the Ba’al prophets since by doing so it will also be involved in the Kiddush Hashem created at Har HaCarmel. Thus, Eliyahu HaNavi returns the bull to the prophets of Ba’al after it ran away from them.",

What is even more shocking, however, is that after Radak makes this comment, he proceeds to cite the Midrash in full (in contrast to Rashi who presents only an abbreviated form of the Midrash). If Radak believes this Midrash is unreasonable, why does he quote it at length?",

Often, Rambam insists it should be taken seriously, but not literally. We suggest that Radak believes that if one takes the Midrash regarding the conversation that took place between Eliyahu HaNavi and the bull in a literal sense, then it is “<i>Rachok Min HaSeichel</i>.” However, if one takes it seriously, as teaching a vitally important lesson, then it is quite deep and profound.",

                "What might be the profound lesson one may derive from what otherwise appears to be a fantastic tale? We suggest it may be understood in light of the Midrash, which states, “<i>HaKol Mevakshin Tafkidan</i>,” “every being seeks to fulfill its divinely assigned mission” (Eichah Rabbah 1:30). The Midrash states that even animals and trees deeply yearn for, and go to extraordinary lengths to fulfill their assigned tasks. The Midrash even goes as far to say as roads also seek to fulfill their role, and therefore the roads of Zion were upset when travelers no longer traversed them following the Churban.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">86</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This author is never upset when caught in traffic when visiting Jerusalem. Empty roads of Zion are a sign of mourning, while jammed roads are a symbol of the blessed revitalization and rejuvenation of Eretz Yisrael in general, and Yerushalayim specifically. </i>",
                "Similarly, the Midrash expresses that the Ba’al bull deeply yearns to fulfill its mission, and experiences profound pain when it is not enabled to do so. Although animals, trees, and roads may not actually experience deep anxiety when not fulfilling their missions, we Jews (and all human beings) should, nay must have a sense of mission and a deep zeal to fulfill our missions. The satisfaction of those who manage to discipline themselves to accomplish their divine assignment in this world is immense and incomparable.",

                "Although the Midrash of the talking bull may at first glance seem wild, and even “<i>Rachok Min HaSeichel</i>,” upon deeper reflection, one realizes that it teaches the vitally important message to discover one’s divine mission, and to subsequently fulfill it with great zeal and joy."

                "It is the climax of an incredible day, which reenacts the climax of an incredible event. Both Ashkenazic and Sephardic Jews end Yom Kippur with a recital of “<i>Hashem Hu Ha’Elokim</i>” multiple times, following the precedent set by the northern Bnei Yisrael at Har HaCarmel (Melachim I 18:39). Although this practice is not mentioned in the Gemara, it is mentioned by Tosafot (Berachot 34a s.v. Psuka).",
                "<i><b>Explanation of the Practice</b></i>",
                "The parallel between the culmination of Yom Kippur and the event at Har HaCarmel seems at first to be most appropriate. At Har HaCarmel, the Bnei Yisrael initially are “<i>Posechim Al Shnei HaSe’ifim</i>,” “dancing between two opinions,” (Melachim I 18:21) unsure and tottering between commitment to Hashem and devotion to idolatry. However, at the conclusion of this event, Am Yisrael is fully convinced of Hashem, and expresses full Emunah by twice proclaiming “<i>Hashem Hu HaElokim</i>,” “Hashem is the God” (Melachim I 18:39).",
                "Hopefully, the intense twenty-five hour deep spiritual immersion of Yom Kippur brings about a similar transformation. We may have entered the holy day struggling with dual spiritual loyalties, but emerge at its conclusion fully committed to Hashem!",
                "Moreover, the parallel is enhanced if one assumes, as does the Malbim (Melachim I 18:41), that the Bnei Yisrael at Har HaCarmel fast as a plea for rain. Eliyahu HaNavi then instructs them to eat and drink. We, similarly, shortly after proclaiming “<i>Hashem Hu Ha’Elokim</i>,” proceed to break fast.",

As is evident from the opening of Melachim I 19, the impact of the events at Har HaCarmel on Am Yisrael is shockingly fleeting. If so, why would we wish to invoke this admittedly extraordinary, yet, in terms of long-term impact, exceedingly limited event?",

We find this, for example, in Megillat Esther. Esther 9 states no less than three times that the Jews do not take from the spoils after attacking Haman’s supporters.",
                "One is left wondering why this fact is so strongly emphasized by Megillat Esther. An answer that is often given is based on the fact that the Jewish leaders of this war, Esther and Mordechai, are descendants of Sha’ul HaMelech (Esther 2:5, Megillah 13b and 16a). The fact that the army, under the auspices of Mordechai and Esther, does not take from the spoils of war serves to rectify Sha’ul HaMelech’s sin of taking from the spoils of war after his attack on Amaleik (Shemuel I 15:9).",
                "<i><b>Reparative Reenactment</b></i>",
                "We suggest that part of the reason why we reenact Har HaCarmel and repeat “<i>Hashem Hu HaElokim</i>” at the culmination of Yom Kippur, is to repair Am Yisrael’s past mistake. At Har HaCarmel, the Bnei Yisrael’s transformation hardly lasts, because little investment is put into the event. When one makes little investment in an activity, it will almost invariably lead to poor results. As the Gemara teaches “<i>HaOmer Lo Yagati U’Matzati Al Ta'amin</i>,” “If someone says, 'I have not toiled and I have nonetheless succeeded,' do not believe him’” (Megillah 6b).",
                "However, one who makes a considerable investment is much more likely to succeed. “<i>HaOmer Yagati U’Matzati, Ta'amin</i>,” “If someone says, 'I have toiled and I have succeeded,' believe him” (ibid.). For example, the first Luchot HaBrit, fashioned by Hashem, are destroyed shortly after Matan Torah. In contrast, the second set of Luchot, fashioned by Moshe Rabbeinu, withstand the test of time.",
                "At Har HaCarmel, the Bnei Yisrael are passive observers; thus, the long-term impact of the event is minimal. By contrast, we invest tremendously into Yom Kippur, considering our preparation during the Aseret Yemei Teshuvah and Chodesh Elul (and even more so for Sephardic Jews who recite Selichot the forty days before Yom Kippur).",
                " Thus, our recitation of “<i>Hashem Hu Ha’Elokim</i>” at the end of Yom Kippur has the potential to repair the shortcomings of the “<i>Hashem Hu Ha’Elokim</i>” of Har HaCarmel.

The first is Yaakov Avinu bowing to Yosef on the former’s death bed, despite Yaakov’s parental status and advanced age. The second is Moshe Rabbeinu showing a modicum of respect to Paroh, despite the latter’s evil character. Lastly, he notes that Eliyahu HaNavi exhibits Kavod to Achav by running before his chariot at the end of Melachim I 18.",

Destabilizing a government, even a less than excellent one, has enormous potential to create anarchy and sheer chaos that breaks apart the entire society. Thus, we must pray even for the benefit of spiritually deficient leaders, for even they are likely a better alternative to a leadership vacuum (as noted by Sefer HaChinuch Mitzvah 71). Thus, Eliyahu HaNavi refrains from killing Achav and Izevel for fear of destabilizing the entire society and disrupting the broader community.",

R. Yochanan ben Zakkai correctly predicted that Vespasian would become the Roman Emperor and that the Beit HaMikdash would soon be destroyed; in return, Vespasian granted R. Yochanan three wishes.

In fact, we can discern four distinct stages in Achav’s development in Melachim I 18. At first, Achav is described by the righteous Ovadiah as seeking to kill every legitimate Navi, especially Eliyahu HaNavi. Next, Achav advances to a point where he agrees to meet with Eliyahu HaNavi. Achav’s then transitions from insulting Eliyahu HaNavi as an “<i>Ocheir Yisrael</i>,” “destroyer of Israel” (Melachim I 18:17) to following Eliyahu’s instructions to assemble all of Israel and the “prophets” of Ba’al at Har HaCarmel for an “Emunah showdown.” After the fire descends from heaven only upon Eliyahu HaNavi’s Korban, it seems that Achav joins the nation in proclaiming “<i>Hashem Hu Ha’Elokim, Hashem Hu Ha’Elokim</i>,” “Hashem is the [true] God, Hashem is the [true] God” (Melachim I 18:39). Achav might even participate in the eradication of the four hundred “prophets” of Ba’al. At the very least, Achav does not object.

TABC alumnus Binyamin Jachter (‘17) argues that Eliyahu HaNavi calls for all of the Bnei Yisrael, as well as Izevel’s prophets, to attend the great Har HaCarmel showdown. Izevel is not invited or, at least, feels that she is not welcome. Binyamin assumes that Izevel primarily perceives herself as a Phoenician princess, and not as an Israelite queen. It is thus reasonable to assume that she regards the Har HaCarmel event as irrelevant to her. Moreover, the prophets are described as “eating at Izevel’s table,” meaning that she controls the entire Ba’al and Asheirah enterprise in Israel. Accordingly, she has no motivation to attend an event that could possibly compromise her power. Achav, by contrast, does not seem to be invested in these prophets. Achav attends Har HaCarmel because he does not have much to lose, and is eager for the famine to end.</i>",

Similar to Shlomo HaMelech’s marriage to Bat Paroh, we see that marrying the daughter of a powerful king may eventually lead to horrific consequences.

We suggest that Eliyahu HaNavi seeks to invoke the memory of the Cheit HaEigel to spur Hashem to punish the Bnei Yisrael. Indeed, the Metzudat David understands Eliyahu HaNavi’s proclamation that Am Yisrael has abandoned the Brit, destroyed altars, killed prophets, and that he is the lone faithful individual left, as a plea to Hashem to punish the Bnei Yisrael.",

In Melachim I 19, Eliyahu HaNavi seems to say that since the Bnei Yisrael have returned to idolatry, and have remained devoted to it even after the events at Har HaCarmel, they deserve to be punished both for the current Avodah Zarah and for the Cheit HaEigel as well.",

                "<i><b>Ralbag’s Approach</b></i>",
                "Ralbag understands that Eliyahu HaNavi acts in a natural manner, and does not rely upon a miracle to save himself from Izevel’s death threat. TABC students wondered why Eliyahu HaNavi remains within Achav’s jurisdiction and reach in Melachim I 17. We suggest that Melachim I 17 is an exception since Hashem specifically commands him to hide in certain places.",

Why then, does Eliyahu HaNavi continue to flee from Be’eir Sheva to the desert? Ralbag and Radak both explain that Eliyahu HaNavi fears that Izevel can still catch him in Be’eir Sheva. TABC students explain that even though Be’eir Sheva is under Yehoshafat’s rule, Eliyahu HaNavi may fear that Izevel will send a “hit squad” outside her jurisdiction to kill him, as has happened not infrequently in the modern world (such as Leon Trotsky’s assassination by Joseph Stalin’s “hit men” while in exile in Mexico).",
                "It would seem counterintuitive to flee to the desert for safety, considering that a desert is a very dangerous place to be alone without provisions. TABC students surmised that Eliyahu HaNavi seeks to escape a torturous death at the hands of Izevel’s forces in retaliation for eliminating the prophets of Ba’al. In addition, by falling into Izevel’s hands, Eliyahu would create a serious Chillul Hashem.",
                "Finally, Ralbag explains that Eliyahu HaNavi wishes to die due to his suffering from severe hunger in the desert. One could ask, why Eliyahu heads to the desert without realizing that he will soon be in such a precarious situation. The answer is, as we suggested earlier, that Eliyahu HaNavi seeks to avoid death at the hands of Izevel.",

This refers to the isolation of oneself in an attempt to draw closer to Hashem and to perfect one’s Neshamah.",

Interestingly, the Seforno (Shemot 3:1) explains that Moshe Rabbeinu retreats to the desert to graze his sheep to isolate himself and draw closer to Hashem. Thus, from a certain perspective, Breslover Chassidim act like both Moshe Rabbeinu and Eliyahu HaNavi!",

Therefore, once he realizes that he cannot accomplish any more with Am Yisrael in the Northern Kingdom, it becomes time for him to return to isolation. The Malbim also explains that this is why Eliyahu HaNavi leaves Be’eir Sheva and travels to the desert. The Malbim notes that during his time in the desert, Eliyahu HaNavi completely repairs his Neshamah, and draws as close to Hashem as humanly possible, which is why he wishes to die. Once he completes his mission on Earth, he feels that it is time to leave.",
                "The Malbim explains the phrase <i>“Ki Lo Tov Ani Mei’Avotai</i>,<i>”</i> as saying that even though Eliyahu HaNavi rectifies his Neshamah to be on the level of the Adam HaRishon’s Neshamah prior to eating from the Eitz HaDa’at, and therefore, in theory, deserves to live forever, Eliyahu HaNavi argues that it is not right for this to happen since he should not be perceived as greater than his ancestors, who all eventually died.",

In turn, we suggest that indeed Eliyahu HaNavi feels that he has accomplished all he could do with Am Yisrael of the Northern Kingdom, as set forth by the Malbim. However, rather than understanding Eliyahu HaNavi’s retreat as done with a dispassionate calm, we suggest that Eliyahu HaNavi leaves in a fury.",
                "According to our approach, Eliyahu HaNavi is deeply frustrated, upset, and disappointed with the northern Bnei Yisrael. After three years of punishing drought to incontrovertibly prove to the northern Bnei Yisrael that <i>“Hashem Hu HaElokim</i>,<i>”</i> “Hashem is the [true] God” (Melachim I 18:39), Eliyahu HaNavi has done everything possible, and then some. What more can he or anyone else do? Even after the miraculous events at Har HaCarmel, the northern Bnei Yisrael fail to rise in protest against Izevel when she issues a death threat against Eliyahu HaNavi.",
                "In other words, Eliyahu HaNavi’s flight from the north is not due to safety or spiritual retreat. Rather, he is, simply put, a fed-up man of faith! He is so upset, that he runs away— first to Be’eir Sheva, and then to the desert, where he expresses a wish to die. After being revived and nourished by the Malach, Eliyahu HaNavi proceeds to retreat even further to Har Choreiv. When Hashem twice asks him <i>“Mah Lecha Po Eliyahu,”</i> “why are you here Eliyahu?” (Melachim I 19:9, 19:13), Eliyahu launches into a severe criticism of Am Yisrael for having abandoned their commitment to Hashem. Eliyahu HaNavi very much acts and sounds like a fed-up man of faith!",
                "<i><b>A Parallel to Moshe Rabbeinu</b></i>",
                "We may draw a parallel to Moshe Rabbeinu in BeMidbar 11. In BeMidbar 10, Moshe Rabbeinu confidently proclaims to his father-in-law Yitro that they will soon travel to Eretz Yisrael. Moshe Rabbeinu is under the impression that he has succeeded in effecting a complete recovery for Am Yisrael from the depths of the Cheit HaEigel. He believes that he has successfully raised their spiritual level to the point where they deserve to enter Eretz Yisrael.",
                "However, Moshe Rabbeinu fails to read the cues and does not realize that the Bnei Yisrael’s compliance is only skin deep. For example, Moshe Rabbeinu interprets the Bnei Yisrael’s great enthusiasm in leaving Choreiv as excitement to enter Eretz Yisrael. However, little does he realize that Bnei Yisrael are more interested in fleeing Har Sinai lest Hashem burdens them with more Mitzvot (see Ramban to the end of BeMidbar 10).",
                "In BeMidbar 10:29, Moshe invites Yitro to join the nation on its journey to Eretz Yisrael. Yitro rejects Moshe’s offer, and instead goes back to his land and family. By not joining the Bnei Yisrael on the remainder of their journey to Eretz Yisrael, Yitro signals to Moshe Rabbeinu that he has misread the situation. Unfortunately, Moshe Rabbeinu does not grasp his father-in-law’s message. Consequently, just when they are on the brink of entering Eretz Yisrael, the Bnei Yisrael make their hysterical demand for meat, and Moshe Rabbeinu is overcome by the realization that the Bnei Yisrael are indeed not ready to enter Eretz Yisrael (BeMidbar 11:1-6). The efforts of more than a year to raise the Bnei Yisrael’s spiritual level had been for naught.",
                "This realization, in turn, brings Moshe Rabbeinu to a dreadful depression. In his despair, he asks Hashem to die: <i>“Ve’Im Kachah At Oseh Li Haregeini Na Harag Im Matzati Chein Be’Einecha Ve’Al Er’eh BeRa’ati,”</i> “If this is the way You treat me, please kill me if I have found favor in Your eyes, so that I do not see my misfortune” (BeMidbar 11:15).",
                "Eliyahu HaNavi’s behavior, who in Melachim I 19 is obviously compared to Moshe Rabbeinu with his forty-day journey to Choreiv having consumed no food and no water, can be best explained by this parallel. Eliyahu HaNavi ecstatically runs for many miles before the chariot of Achav in the pouring rain (Melachim I 18:36) as the latter travels from Har HaCarmel to his winter palace in Yizra’eil. Eliyahu HaNavi’s triumphant “victory run” expresses the great adrenalin rush he experiences in thinking that he has returned the Bnei Yisrael to Hashem. After all, everyone proclaims <i>“Hashem Hu HaElokim”</i> not once, but twice. Even Achav (according to the Malbim), seems to be convinced.",
                "Hashem tries to hint to Eliyahu HaNavi that this change of heart might be a mile wide but is in truth only an inch deep. Hashem does not immediately send the rain Eliyahu HaNavi requests, nay demands, at the end of Melachim I 18. Indeed, Eliyahu’s assistant has to search no less than seven times to see if the rain has come, despite Eliyahu’s lying on the ground and demanding, Choni HaMa’ageil style, that he will not rise until it rains (see Ralbag 18:42). We suggest that Hashem signals to Eliyahu HaNavi that all is not well in the Northern Kingdom. Unfortunately, like Moshe Rabbeinu, Eliyahu HaNavi does not read the cue and does not realize the true nature of the northern Bnei Yisrael’s reaction to the events on Har HaCarmel.",
                "Tragically, the sobering reality unexpectedly and entirely comes crashing down on Eliyahu HaNavi when no community protest follows Izevel’s brazenly issued death threat. It is as if Eliyahu has done absolutely nothing to impact the northern Bnei Yisrael. All of Eliyahu HaNavi’s extraordinary actions seem to amount to nothing. For this reason, Eliyahu HaNavi runs and bitterly expresses his scathing criticism not once, but twice, of the Bnei Yisrael’s complete abandonment of the Brit, and their warranted punishment (see Ralbag to Melachim I 19:8 and the Metzudat David to Melachim I 19:10, s.v. VaYevakshu). He even goes as far as to ask Hashem to die!",
                "When Eliyahu HaNavi proclaims that he “is not greater than his ancestors,” he might mean that, up until this point, he has harbored an ambition that with his unique methodology, he could surpass his ancestors (assuming in accordance with the opinions in Chazal that Eliyahu HaNavi is not Pinechas) in impacting the northern Bnei Yisrael to return to Hashem. Where his ancestors failed, Eliyahu HaNavi thought his innovative and more aggressive approach would succeed. The sobering reality of Melachim I 19 makes Eliyahu HaNavi realize that he is no more successful than his ancestors, and has failed just as they did, despite his new style.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">93</sup><i class=\"footnote\">TABC student Akiva Prager (‘20) thought this answer was so compelling that he wondered why the traditional Mefarshim did not offer this approach.

                "At least one powerful lesson may be gleaned from this intense episode. Both Moshe Rabbeinu and Eliyahu HaNavi find themselves at a peak emotional high, and then very quickly cascade downwards to a very deep depression. Rambam’s lesson in Hilchot Dei’ot 1-3, to avoid extremes, looms very large in this context. One should avoid even extreme happiness (see Berachot 31a), for in its wake the pendulum will often swing and come crashing downwards, leading one to a very painful emotional state.",
                "In addition, almost instantaneously, the supremely confident Eliyahu HaNavi of Melachim I 17-18 suddenly transforms into an exceedingly humble soul, proclaiming <i>“Lo Tov Ani Mei’Avotai.” </i>A healthier approach would have been to avoid the extremes at both ends of the pendulum.",
                "In the rest of Melachim I 19, Hashem seeks to restore Eliyahu HaNavi’s equilibrium. Eliyahu HaNavi’s response to Hashem’s efforts remains to be scrutinized and mined for deep meaning."

                "<i><b>Extending the Zohar from Brit Milah to Brit Bein HaBetarim</b></i>",
                "A very reasonable extension of the Zohar is that Eliyahu HaNavi also attends every Seder. The Seder is fundamentally an expression of fidelity and commitment to the Brit Bein HaBetarim (the covenant between the pieces, where Hashem set forth the recurring pattern of Jewish history of suffering and redemption, see BeReishit 15). Thus, it makes eminent sense to extend the Zohar, and assert that Eliyahu HaNavi is assigned by Hashem to attend our Sedarim to witness that Am Yisrael, contrary to Eliyahu HaNavi’s assertion, has not abandoned its deep connection to the Brit with Hashem, as expressed in the Brit Bein HaBetarim.",
                "The extension from Brit Milah to the Brit Bein HaBetarim takes on even more significance when one considers the deep connection between the Korban Pesach, the quintessential expression of the Brit Bein HaBetarim and Brit Milah. According to Pirkei DeRabi Eliezer (29), it was these two Mitzvot which Hashem assigned to us on the eve of Yetzi’at Mitzrayim. The merit of our observance of these two Mitzvot, states Pirkei DeRabi Eliezer, earned our redemption from the Egyptian bondage.",

                "Brit Milah and Korban Pesach may be seen as “twin Mitzvot.” They are, for example, the only positive commandments for which there is a punishment of Karet for one who fails to fulfill them. Karet, excision from the nation, is a most appropriate punishment for not performing these two Mitzvot, in which we pledge, more than any other Mitzvah, our allegiance to our covenant with Hashem. Similarly, in the Haftarah for the first day of Pesach, we read of Yehoshua’s coupling of the Mitzvot of Brit Milah and Korban Pesach after the Bnei Yisrael’s entry into Eretz Yisrael.",

The most well-known explanation for the rabbinic enactment to have four Kosot at the Seder is that the four Kosot correspond to the four stages of Ge’ulah presented at the beginning of Parashat Va’eira (Yerushalmi Pesachim 10:1, cited by Rashi and Rashbam to Pesachim 99b).",
                "The Seforno explains that these four stages refer to the end of the suffering during the Ten Makkot (when the Egyptians were too preoccupied with their suffering to afflict us), the end of our subjugation as slaves when we left Egypt, our redemption with the great miracles of the splitting of the Yam Suf, and our adoption as a nation by Hashem at Har Sinai.",
                "There is, however, a fifth stage of Geulah referred to as “<i>VeHeiveiti</i>,” “I will bring you [to the land of Israel].” The Seforno notes that the fifth stage fundamentally differs from the first four stages.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">97</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Likewise, Rambam (Hilchot Chameitz UMatzah 8:10) distinguishes between the first four cups and the fifth cup.</i> The first four stages of Geulah, explains the Seforno, are promised unconditionally to Am Yisrael. The fifth stage, though, is preceded by the statement that we will internalize the message that Hashem is our God. The Seforno explains that we will be entitled to enter the land only if we succeed in internalizing this message. The generation that exits Mitzrayim does not enter Eretz Yisrael precisely due to its failure to take to heart the message that Hashem is our God. The paralyzing fear that results from Meraglim’s report is a telltale sign that the people have not fully recognized Hashem as their God, and they, therefore, do not deserve to enter Eretz Yisrael.",

Once Hashem informs Eliyahu that he is to return to the Northern Kingdom, Eliyahu HaNavi is assured of Hashem’s protection. We may add that Eliyahu HaNavi is never scared of Izevel, as we suggested in an earlier chapter, but that he is exasperated by the lack of commitment to Hashem amongst Bnei Yisrael of the north. However, once Eliyahu is told by Hashem to return and effectuate punishment, Eliyahu is eager to return in the hope that this will lead the northern Bnei Yisrael to Teshuvah.",

                "The first question is a far more challenging issue. The Malbim solves the problem by arguing that Achav’s Teshuvah (recorded in Melachim I 21:27-29) alters the calculus. Teshuvah can overturn a negative decree as is clearly evidenced by Sefer Yonah. Once Achav performs Teshuvah, the anointment of Chaza’eil and Yeihu is delayed. The Malbim seems to adequately explain why Achav deserves to avoid punishment, and thus Yeihu is not appointed as his replacement. However, what do the rest of the northern Bnei Yisrael do to merit the delay of Chaza’eil’s appointment?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">99</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As noted by TABC student Ezra Baron (‘20). </i>",
                "Radak solves the problem by utilizing the principle of Shelichut. The Halachah teaches that the actions of one’s Shali’ach (messenger) are the equivalent of one’s own actions (“<i>Shelucho Shel Adam Kemoto”</i>). Thus, Eliyahu HaNavi fulfills his mandate by passing the baton to Elisha to anoint Yeihu and Chaza’eil. While Elisha does anoint Chaza’eil, Elisha, in turn, passes his obligation to appoint Chaza’eil to one of his students (whom Chazal identify as Yonah ben Amittai).",
                "Radak explains that the fact that Eliyahu encounters Elisha on the road before meeting Chaza’eil and Yeihu, signals to Eliyahu HaNavi that Hashem wants these latter two anointments to be carried out by Elisha. However, TABC students were left with the feeling that this alone is insufficient evidence to deviate from Hashem’s command.",
                "We will now attempt to answer our second question. The destruction of all but 7,000 of the Bnei Yisrael never materializes. Achav’s minimal Teshuvah hardly suffices to overturn this severe decree.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">100</sup><i class=\"footnote\">TABC alumnus Binyamin Jachter (‘17) suggests a straightforward answer. Perhaps Eliyahu HaNavi does not intend to refrain from anointing the other two. He starts with the first of the three that he encounters. His goal is to complete his mission one by one. Until Elisha is trained, this part of his mission is not finished, and he is not ready to move to his next step. Eliyahu HaNavi assumes that he is going to complete the next portion of his mission, but Hashem abruptly takes him out of the picture. Following Eliyahu HaNavi’s fiery ascension, Elisha is tasked with the appointment of Chaza’eil and Yeihu. </i>",

                "Perhaps a key to resolving the remaining issues emerges from the dramatic first encounter between Eliyahu HaNavi and Elisha (described in Melachim I 19:19-21). In a previous chapter, we carefully “read between the lines” of this great interaction, and drew some conclusions regarding Eliyahu HaNavi and Elisha’s relationship.",
                "The essential point that emerges from that discussion is that Elisha makes it very clear that while he is completely devoted to Eliyahu HaNavi, his style will be different.

                "Eliyahu HaNavi intuits Elisha’s personality. He realizes that Hashem chose the gentler and more down to earth Elisha to replace him. This decision indicates that Hashem wishes for a gentler approach that will soften the prophesied blows of Chaza’eil and Yeihu.",
                "Let us see how this is applied in practice.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">101</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The following section is greatly influenced by Rav Elchanan Samet’s analysis that appears in his Pirkei Eliyahu. A major difference is that Rav Samet assumes that Eliyahu HaNavi moderates his tone and style somewhat after he returns from Choreiv. This author and TABC students over the years have found this unconvincing, and thus we have presented an alternative explanation as to why Eliyahu HaNavi outsources the appointments of Chaza’eil and Yeihu to Elisha. </i> In Melachim II 8:13, Elisha informs Chaza’eil that he will be the new king, and predicts that he will inflict extremely harsh punishment upon Am Yisrael. However, while Chaza’eil does attack northern Israel<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">102</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chaza’eil’s attack is partially documented in the famous Tel Dan Stele, on display at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. </i> as recorded in Melachim II 12-13, the damage is dramatically less severe than predicted by Elisha. What is the reason for this change?",
                "It seems that Elisha’s crying when appointing Chaza’eil (Melachim II 8:11) significantly impacts the king. Apparently, Elisha’s tears soften Chaza’eil and manage to influence him to lighten the blow on northern Israel.",
                "The choice of a Navi makes a dramatic difference. The Gemara (Sanhedrin 89a) states that “two prophets do not prophesy in the identical style.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">103</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The difference is style applies not only to Nevi’im but also to Posekim, rabbinic leaders, and Torah commentaries. Beit Hillel and Beit Shamai, the Lubavitcher Rebbe and the Satmar Rebbe, and Ramban and Ibn Ezra are examples of contemporaneous pairs with considerably different styles. </i> Furthermore, the Gemara (Megillah 14b) records:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">104</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Translation adapted from The William Davidson Talmud, www.sefaria.org/Megillah.14b. </i>",
                "<i>How could Yoshiyahu ignore Yirmiyahu and send emissaries to Chuldah [to discover the meaning of the discovered Torah scrolls]? The Sages of the school of R.

                "Clearly, we see that the Navi who delivers a prophecy makes a major difference in its fulfillment. Therefore, we suggest that Eliyahu HaNavi recognizes that if Hashem instructs him to appoint Elisha, a dramatically softer personality than he, then Hashem clearly wants the prophecy regarding Chaza’eil and Yeihu to be brought about in a compassionate manner by a gentler and more compassionate Navi. Therefore, Eliyahu HaNavi decides to outsource the anointing of Chaza’eil and Yeihu to Elisha.",
                "Finally, now we understand why the prophecy of only 7,000 faithful Bnei Yisrael remaining never comes to fruition. The softer style of Elisha blunts the severity of the actions of Chaza’eil and Yeihu.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">105</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Elisha waits quite a long time before ordering his student to appoint Yeihu. Elisha is exceedingly generous with the time he extends to Yehoram ben Achav to perform Teshuvah in the hope that the Teshuvah will override the decree to appoint Yeihu to eliminate the house of Achav. However, when it is time to appoint Yeihu, Elisha designates an anonymous student, identified by Chazal (cited by Rashi to Melachim II 9:1) as Yonah ben Amitai to do the job. The elimination of Beit Achav and the idolatry of northern Israel was a bloody one. Yonah, a great advocate of strict justice (as is quite apparent from Sefer Yonah), was a far more appropriate Navi to execute the appointment of Yeihu than the softer-hearted Elisha. </i>",

As explained by Radak and Ralbag, the mantel is a symbol of Nevu’ah, as is evident from Zechariah 13:4.

Eliyahu HaNavi may be understood as a completely self-made individual and may have even departed from a family practice of idol worship (recall that it is far from a unanimous view in Chazal that Eliyahu HaNavi is to be identified as Pinechas). Elisha is built in part from his family’s wealth, and by working for and with his family. Their success is his since they helped him develop into an honorable man. Elisha, therefore, has a different relationship with his family than does Eliyahu HaNavi.</i> Indeed, Eliyahu HaNavi offers an ambivalent response to this request (see Radak to Melachim I 19:19, s.v.

Elisha permanently and irretrievably burns the bridges to his past life of affluence. There is now no way back— he locks himself into a full commitment to Eliyahu HaNavi. His opening act has to be dramatic and complete, or else he will look at the long road ahead, and quickly turn back.",

He explained that he wanted to focus his complete and undivided attention on Torah and spiritual growth without any distractions that would emerge from tending to his real estate interests. This personal decision, of course, was a correct one, as Rav Shlomo Zalman emerged as one of the leading Torah scholars of his generation.

Moreover, as Radak (Melachim I 21:10) notes, even the Bnei Yisrael of the Northern Kingdom do not tolerate any royal perpetration of evil against the populace.

One time, Navot decided to stay home. He paid the ultimate penalty for that refusal by having his vineyard coveted by King Achav, which eventually cost him his life. When individuals are blessed by Hashem with special abilities, these are tools He wishes us to use to serve Him.",

                "Accordingly, since Navot does not rely on Hashem’s promise of protection due to his fear of Achav, Hashem punishes Navot by having Achav confiscate his field. Navot, it turns out, fears Achav when he should not, and does not fear him when he should. In other words, Navot’s needless fear (“<i>BeChiya Shel Chinam</i>;” see Ta’annit 29a) causes him to lose that which he fears losing.",

There, Hashem designates a Kikayon (a leafy plant, see Rashi ad loc.) to provide shade for Yonah. The Navi is elated. However, Hashem then sends a worm to destroy the plant. Once again exposed to the elements, Yonah feels faint and asks for death. At this point, Hashem asks Yonah, “<i>HaHeiteiv Charah Lecha Al HaKikayon</i>,” “Are you so deeply grieved over the Kikayon?,” to which Yonah responds, “<i>Heiteiv Charah Li Ad Mavet</i>,” “I am greatly grieved to death” (Yonah 4:9).",

In the Amidah, we ask Hashem “<i>Chus VeRacheim Aleinu</i>,” “have <i>Chus </i>and mercy on us.” <i>Chus </i>is a prerequisite to <i>Racheim</i>, mercy. When one is emotionally invested in someone, they have mercy on them. An example is a caring Rebbe who makes an emotional investment in his students, and therefore grades examinations in a manner that is tilted in favor of the students. We ask Hashem to similarly emotionally invest in our well-being, and as a result, deal with us mercifully.

When the young Yishmael cries out to Hashem to save him from his thirst in the desert, the angels cry out for Hashem to not save him based on the cruelty Yishmael’s descendants would inflict upon the Jewish people. Hashem resoundingly rejects the Malachim and insists on judging Yishmael “<i>BaAsher Hu Sham</i>,” “as he is then” (BeReishit 21:17), based on his current actions and not on the despicable behavior of his progeny.

Sefer Yonah ends with one of the most revelatory episodes in all of Tanach, in which Hashem reveals His “emotional state” and mindset regarding how He judges the world.

                "R. Levi devoted no less than a year to analyzing Achav’s character! This, however, should not be surprising, since it is difficult to understand how such an inveterate Rasha such as Achav could actually have committed such a significant array of good deeds.",
                "Simply blaming Achav’s bad deeds on Izevel is an inadequate explanation of his episodes of poor behavior. In Melachim I 22, Achav abuses the authentic Navi Michah without any evidence of having been spurred to do so by Izevel. Additionally, Achav caustically calls Eliyahu HaNavi “a polluter of Israel” (Melachim I 18:17) despite the lack of Izevel’s presence and influence.",
                "We thus readily understand why R. Levi devoted so much time to solving the mystery of Achav’s behavior. It is extremely challenging to discover any rhyme, reason, or pattern to this king’s record. How could the same king who shows so much devotion to Kevod HaTorah, permit the brazen and widespread introduction of Ba’al and Asheirah into northern Israel?",
                "<i><b>Achav’s Ineligibility for Olam HaBa</b></i>",
                "The Gemara (Sanhedrin 102b) records a dispute between R. Nachman and R. Yosef regarding Achav’s spiritual status:",
                "<i>R. Nachman said: Achav was equally balanced [in terms of Mitzvot and Aveirot], since it is written, “The Lord asked, ‘Who will entice Achav so that he will march and fall at Ramot-Gil’ad?’ Then one said thus, and another said thus” (Melachim I 22:20). R. Yosef objected: He of whom it is written, “Indeed, there was never anyone like Achav, who committed himself to doing what was displeasing to the Lord, at the instigation of his wife Izevel” (Melachim I 21:25), yet you say that he was equally balanced!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">125</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Translation modified from Rabbi Angel. </i></i>",
                "Achav had many bright moments and thus it is understandable that R. Nachman regards Achav as equally balanced. However, Sefer Melachim’s summary of Achav’s reign seems to clearly support R. Yosef’s assessment of Achav. Moreover, Achav’s exclusion from Olam HaBa supports R. Yosef’s conclusion as well. How can there be evidence for both sides of this argument?",
                "An explanation seems to stem from Rambam in his Hilchot Teshuvah (3:2), where he explains that Hashem bases His judgment of an individual on the majority of their actions.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">126</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rambam codifies that this concept also extends to communal and global levels.</i> Hashem weighs an individual’s merits and sins, both quantitatively and qualitatively,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">127</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Some sins outweigh many merits, and some merits outweigh many sins. </i> and reckons His judgment accordingly. However, Rambam adds a critical point: “Only Hashem knows how to weigh and determine the majority of one’s sins and Mitzvot. Only Hashem knows how to weigh and match merits with sins.”",
                "The summary of Achav’s rule presented in Melachim I 16:30-33 and 21:25-26 conveys Hashem’s reckoning of Achav’s actions, from which He concludes Achav’s status as a Rasha. Achav’s tolerance towards Avodah Zarah in northern Israel, his (at minimum) indifference towards the persecution of Hashem’s prophets, and the evil innovation of the incident with Navot HaYizre’eili all clearly nullify any good that he does throughout his lifetime. Thus, while his good and bad actions indeed appear to be equally balanced as R. Nachman states, in Hashem’s eyes, Achav is judged as entirely evil, as R. Yosef concludes.",
                "<i><b>Yeish Koneh Olamo BeSha’ah Achat</b></i>",
                "The Gemara (Avodah Zarah 17a) relates the story of Elazar ben Dordaya, a serial violator of severe Torah prohibitions.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">128</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the later chapter “Menashe vs. ‘Rabi’ Elazar ben Dordaya” for a more complete presentation of this Gemara.</i> Yet upon his dramatic life-ending effort at Teshuvah, a heavenly voice announces that Elazar ben Dordaya is granted a place in heaven. R. Yehudah HaNasi proclaims in tears that “<i>Yeish Koneh Olamo BeSha’ah Achat</i>,” “there are those who earn their share in Olam Haba in one hour” (i.e. one episode in their lives).",
                "We see, however, from Achav that not everyone is able to be “<i>Koneh Olamo BeSha’ah Achat</i>.” Achav has many great moments, but they do not earn him a place in Olam HaBa. Once again, we return to Rambam’s dictum that only Hashem can properly gauge the relative impact of one’s merits and sins.",
                "<i><b>Conclusion</b></i>",
                "R. Yehudah HaNasi cried when he proclaimed “<i>Yeish Koneh Olamo BeSha’ah Achat</i>” because the reverse is true as well. One can lose his share in Olam HaBa as a result of a single episode. Just because one performs some good deeds, even if they are spectacularly good deeds, one is not guaranteed a place in Olam HaBa. Achav is the paradigm of an individual who accomplishes many good deeds and yet is denied a place in the World to Come.",
                "Yes, Achav is indeed a Rasha. Just because we can identify someone’s many positive actions, this does not necessarily preclude that individual from being classified as a Rasha. The lesson for us is powerful and of paramount importance. One must be vigilant to one’s last breath on this earth to not only perform good deeds in this world but also to avoid any and all negative activity. Achav serves as a sobering reminder that the Mitzvot we perform do not necessarily render us Tzaddikim, or shield us from severe punishment."

            "Two Tales of Yehoshafat": [
                "<i><b>Two Accounts — Sefer Melachim vs. Divrei HaYamim</b></i>",
                "Yehoshafat is presented in a grand manner at significant length in Divrei HaYamim II 17-20. Yet, Sefer Melachim devotes barely 11 Pesukim (Melachim I 22:41-51) to the description of his reign. The rest of Yehoshafat’s noteworthy royal activities are either omitted by Sefer Melachim or scattered throughout it. While most of the information is identical, the difference in the format of the two accounts is striking. Sefer Melachim’s presentation clearly diminishes the great king portrayed in Divrei HaYamim. In fact, Yehoshafat is presented without a formal introducton in Melachim I 22, and only at the end of the chapter is he presented as a footnote to his earlier mention. What is the reason behind these two dramatically different styles of portrayal?",
                "<i><b>A Classic Tanach Style</b></i>",
                "This phenomenon is an example of a classic Tanach style of presenting a nuanced portrayal of a multifaceted personality or event. Two examples stand out. Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik, in<i> Lonely Man of Faith</i>, beautifully explains how the two varying presentations of the creation of man in the first two chapters of Sefer BeReishit represent a dialectical tension inherent within the human personality (designated as Adam I and Adam II). Rabbi Elhanan Samet, in his <i>Iyunim LeParshi’ot HaShavu’a</i> to Parashat Devarim, explains how the different portrayals of the Meraglim (spies) episodes in Sefer BeMidbar 13-14 and Devarim 1 blend two different aspects of the multifaceted event.",
                "<i><b>Yehoshafat the Great and Yehoshafat the Disaster</b></i>",
                "Both presentations accurately represent Yehoshafat. To perceive the full picture of his character, one must merge the two presentations. As Chazal teach,<i> “Divrei Torah Aniyim BeMakom Echad Ve’Ashirim BeMakom Acheir</i>,” “the words of Torah are poor in one place and rich in others” (Talmud Yerushalmi Rosh HaShanah 3:5).",
                "On the one hand, Yehoshafat is a grand king, who in many ways is even reminiscent of Shlomo HaMelech in his ambition and his accomplishments.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">129</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For an elaboration on the comparison between Yehoshafat and Shlomo HaMelech, see Rabbi Alex Israel’s “Shiur #29: Chapter 22 ֠Yehoshafat, King of Yehudah,” where he brings attention to some similarities between the two kings:</i>",
                "<i>Chapter 17 of Divrei Ha-yamim lists several aspects of Yehoshafat's reign: 17:5 - Wealth; 17:7-9 - Spreading Torah study nationally; 17:10-11 - Regional Power; 17:12 - Building projects; 17:13 - Industry and GNP; 17:14-19 - A huge, organized army.</i> He is a mighty and successful warrior who emphasizes Torah justice.",
                "However, his decision to marry his son Yehoram, the crown prince, to Ataliah, the daughter<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">130</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This follows the approach of most Mefarshim, such as Ralbag to Melachim II 8:18; Seder Olam (17) asserts that Ataliah is Yehoshafat’s sister. </i> of Achav and Izevel (Melachim II 8:18) results in an unmitigated disaster, as Sefer Melachim alludes (Melachim I 22:45). Yehoram winds up being a wicked king, who follows in the ways of his wife and in-laws. His son Achazyahu follows this terrible example as well. After the latter’s death at the hands of Yeihu, the evil Ataliah seizes control of the government and heads a reign of terror for seven horrifying years, in which she kills all of her opponents, including her grandchildren (with the exclusion of Yeho’ash).",

                "<i><b>Forging an Alliance</b></i>",
                "Yehoshafat is described by Sefer Melachim as a fairly righteous king. This indicates that his motives for marrying off his son to Achav’s daughter are noble. On a simple level, Yehoshafat ascribes tremendous import to the unity of Am Yisrael. He, therefore, dismisses any concerns that may arise from his son marrying an individual raised with entirely foreign values in a home steeped in Avodah Zarah. Yehoshafat feels the overriding importance of seizing the opportunity to end generations-long divisions between the Northern and Southern Kingdoms, which even at times result in horrifyingly bloody civil wars.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">131</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For example, the war between Asa (Yehoshafat’s father), and Ba’asha, the king of the Northern Kingdom (Melachim I 15:16).</i>",
                "One may even surmise that Yehoshafat believes, similar to Shlomo HaMelech, that he and his family will positively influence Ataliah in spiritual matters. Perhaps Yehoshafat hopes that Ataliah will end up like Rivkah, who was raised in a home far removed from Torah values but was positively molded by the influence of Avraham Avinu and Yitzchak Avinu. What Yehoshafat does not realize, though, is that Eliezer (guided by Hashem) chooses Rivkah because he recognizes the spiritual potential latent in her personality, due to the great Chessed she extends to him. Ataliah lacks this quality of character.",
                "Why does Yehoshafat fail to learn from the terrible mistake made by Shlomo HaMelech, when the latter mistakenly believed that he could bring his wives close to the Torah? Shlomo HaMelech’s mistake results in the introduction of Avodah Zarah into Israel and eventually leads to the splitting of his kingdom.",
                "Perhaps Yehoshafat reasons that his situation is different than that of Shlomo HaMelech. Shlomo HaMelech fails due to his being outnumbered by so many women who band together to resist his positive influence. Moreover, Shlomo HaMelech tries to influence non-Jews, while Yehoshafat seeks to influence a member of Am Yisrael to return to the fold. He possibly even hopes that if he will influence Ataliah in the direction of Torah, perhaps she will, in turn, influence her parents,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">132</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The fact that Achav, as we detail in the chapter “Achav’s Good Deeds,” has episodes of devotion to Hashem, may motivate Yehoshafat to conclude that there is potential to bring Achav over to complete devotion to Hashem. It is, though, shocking that Yehoshafat does not protest when Achav abuses Michah the Navi as recorded in Melachim I 22. The text indicates that Yehoshafat is aware of this maltreatment. </i> who will help all of the northern Bnei Yisrael, already under the influence of Eliyahu HaNavi, to return completely to Hashem.",
                "Despite his noble intentions, Yehoshafat ends up as a dismal failure. Chazal express the poignant lesson we must derive from the disaster that Yehoshafat brings about with his good intentions in marrying off his son to Ataliah:",
                "<i>Nitai Ha’Arbeli said: Keep far from a bad neighbor, and do not associate with an evil person… (Pirkei Avot 1:7). As we see with Yehoshafat, who joined together with Achav, and they went up [in war] together to Ramot Gilad, rousing God's anger against him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">133</sup><i class=\"footnote\">During this battle, Yehoshafat narrowly avoids death at the hands of the Aramean enemy. </i> Again, he associated with Achazyahu, and they made boats together in Etzion-Gaver, and God disrupted their actions… (Avot DeRabbi Natan 9:4).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">134</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Alex Israel. “Shiur #29: Chapter 22 ֠Yehoshafat, King of Yehudah.” The Israel Koschitzky Virtual Beit Midrash, Yeshivat Har Etzion, 19 Jan. 2016, www.etzion.org.il/en/shiur-29-chapter-22-%D6%A0yehoshafat-king-yehuda.</i></i>",
                "<i><b>Yehoshafat in Sefer Melachim and Divrei HaYamim</b></i>",
                "Contemporary logicians reject Aristotelian logic’s assertion that one item can either be A or B, but not A and B simultaneously. Rabbi Soloveitchik, in his <i>Lonely Man of Faith</i>, notes that Torah also forcefully rejects this type of monochromatic and binary thinking. Thus, to present a rich textured portrayal of Yehoshafat, the Tanach presents him in one manner in Sefer Melachim, and in another in Divrei HaYamim.",
                "Thus, one is unable to binarily label Yehoshafat as a righteous or evil king. Rather, Yehoshafat is described as a blend between a great king on the one hand, and as one who makes a catastrophic error that leads to both short and long-term disaster on the other. The Tanach communicates this message by presenting one side of Yehoshafat in Sefer Melachim, and the other in Divrei HaYamim.",
                "Both versions of Yehoshafat are true. Yehoshafat is certainly the mighty and righteous king portrayed in Divrei HaYamim. However, Sefer Melachim diminishes Yehoshafat, due to the disaster he facilitates through his alliance with the evil Achav and Izevel.",
                "<i><b>The Difference between Sefer Melachim and Divrei HaYamim</b></i>",
                "Why does the negative portrayal of Yehoshafat appear in Sefer Melachim, and the grand description in Divrei HaYamim? To provide an adequate explanation, we remind ourselves of what we set forth as the basic agendas of both of these Sefarim in the first chapter of this work.",
                "We noted that Sefer Melachim aims to explain how we deteriorated from the pinnacle of having a great king sitting on the throne in Yerushalayim to our people being ensconced in the Babylonian exile. In other words, we may label Sefer Melachim as the “<i>Sefer HaChurban</i>,” “Book of the Destruction,” since it provides a prophetic explanation as to why the Churban occurred.",
                "We also noted that Divrei HaYamim, authored by Ezra HaSofer, presents the stories of Sefer Melachim in more a optimistic style and emphasis to encourage the Jews at the dawn of the era of the Second Temple in their quest to rebuild the Beit HaMikdash, Eretz Yisrael, and the nation.",
                "Thus, Sefer Melachim presents the more dismal version of Yehoshafat. Yehoshafat’s introduction of Ataliah into Yehudah sets a terrible precedent of blatant Avodah Zarah and murder in the Southern Kingdom. In addition to its horrific short-term consequences, this sets a precedent for the idolatrous and murderous actions of Menashe later in Sefer Melachim. Menashe, more than anyone else, is responsible for setting the stage for the Churban.",
                "Moreover, Yehoshafat’s introduction of Ataliah disrupts sixty-six consecutive years of rule over Judea by righteous kings. In addition, it is important to note that Ataliah’s execution is followed by a reign of relatively righteous kings, for no less than one hundred and thirty-seven years! One may imagine an alternative narrative, where Yehoram does not marry Izevel and Achav’s daughter, and in which therefore there is a succession of two hundred years of righteous rule in Malchut Yehudah! Had this happened, perhaps the subsequent kings Achaz and Menashe never would have dared to introduce their evil ways.",
                "Thus, although Yehoshafat is a mighty and righteous king, his well-intentioned alliance with Achav may be understood as ultimately leading to the Churban. Thus, in the eyes of the Sefer Melachim, Yehoshafat’s stature is diminished.",
                "On the other hand, the Divrei HaYamim version of Yehoshafat focuses on his greatness.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">135</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We should note, though, that even Divrei HaYamim does not shy away from criticizing Yehoshafat for his alliance with Achav. This Sefer, however, does not let this failure distract its readers from perceiving his greatness, as is done by Sefer Melachim. We should note that avoiding alliances with people of highly questionable spiritual character is an issue that loomed large during the early days of Bayit Sheini. We paid a steep price (well worth it, of course) to avoid partnering with the locals in the rebuilding of the Beit HaMikdash. </i> The Jews of Bayit Sheini are already familiar with Yehoshafat being cast as a catalyst of the Churban. Divrei HaYamim, though, instead focuses on his many positive achievements, which serve as a role model of nation-building for the new era of the return to Zion of Bayit Sheini.",
                "<i><b>Contemporary Applications</b></i>",
                "The lessons for contemporary Orthodox Judaism’s relationships with non-observant and non-Orthodox Jews are many and manifold. To begin, it certainly seems to support the celebrated stance taken by Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch (1808-1888) regarding Austritt, the establishment of an Orthodox Jewish community recognized as a distinct community apart from its non-Orthodox brethren. However, the analogy is obviously not perfect, which explains why some prominent German Orthodox leaders, such as Rabbi Yitzchak Dov Bamberger (1807-1878), did not subscribe to Rabbi Hirsch’s policy.",
                "The Chareidi community has certainly fully embraced the Rabbi Hirsch model of separation from the non-Orthodox community in almost every sense and venue. For example, the non-Zionism Chareidi stance emerges from, for the most part, an unwillingness to partner with the non-observant Jews in the building of the modern State of Israel.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">136</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Most Chareidi leaders, as noted by Rabbi Hershel Schachter in his Be’Ikvei HaTzon, do not subscribe to the Satmar’s Rebbe’s dictum that the State of Israel violates the Gemara’s teaching of not retaking Eretz Yisrael by force. The Steipler Rav serves as a prominent example.</i> The Chareidi community certainly looks to the Yehoshafat episode as a potent lesson that serves as a major beacon for its communal policies.",
                "The Modern Orthodox and Religious Zionist community must also seriously consider the sobering lessons of the catastrophic Ataliah episode. Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik, in the <i>Chameish Derashot</i>, articulates a model of limited cooperation with non-observant Zionist Jews based on a rabbinic understanding of a portion of the Akeidat Yitzchak story. Avraham Avinu and Yitzchak Avinu march with Yishma’eil and Eliezer (see Rashi to BeReishit 22:3) to Har HaMoriyah. However, once father and son are within sight of Har HaMoriyah, they part ways with Yishmael and Eliezer.",
                "Thus, the Religious Zionist community in Israel grapples with dilemmas as to whether they establish a separate religious educational system (which they have done), separate units in the army (which some do and some do not) and separate political parties (a hotly debated issue).

Achazyahu is a classic Tinok SheNishbah, an individual compared to a child captured and raised among non-Jews and thus not held responsible for his sins, due to his upbringing (see Rambam Hilchot Mamrim 3:3). In this world, however, Hashem throws the proverbial book at Achazyahu for the terrible example he sets for his subjects. He is removed immediately without leaving progeny.

It is comparable to a Jewish child who is raised by the Church and eventually becomes a priest. He will never be readily convinced by a rabbi because all he sees is a rival and adversary, and not a light to reach toward, because that is how he was taught.

Izevel’s religious persecution ceases by the time of Eliyahu’s ascent, as noted by Da’at Mikra. The effect of Har HaCarmel is sufficiently intense that the community no longer tolerates Izevel's mistreatment of the Nevi'im. For this reason, Hashem assures Eliyahu HaNavi at Choreiv that he can safely return to the Northern Kingdom. Eliyahu HaNavi overestimates the threat posed by Izevel when he flees in Melachim I 19.",

                "If we are to assume that Eliyahu HaNavi’s students spend much of their time hiding from persecution in caves before Melachim II 2, then the picture changes completely. It brings to mind the story of R. Shimon bar Yochai and his son R. Elazar hiding from Roman persecution in a cave. During the many years in the cave, R. Shimon bar Yochai learned (or developed) many of the mystical secrets for which he is renowned (as stated in the Piyut, “<i>Bar Yochai Nimshachta Ashrecha</i>”).",

The Piazetzner Rebbe’s <i>Eish Kodesh</i> was written during his terrible suffering in the Warsaw Ghetto and now serves as a classic source of Torah inspiration. Rabbi Moshe Feinstein wrote some of his most incisive Teshuvot during the period of 1934-1936 when placed under house arrest by the Soviet authorities. The Tosafot were written under the cloud of the anti-Jewish rampages of the Crusaders. The effervescence of Torah life in Tzefat in the sixteenth century emerged in the wake of the Expulsion from Spain. The list goes on and on.",

This is a fulfillment of the Torah description of life under Egyptian persecution, that “<i>Ka’Asher Ye’anu Kein Yirbeh VeChein Yifrotz</i>,” “the more they were oppressed, the more they increased and spread out” (Shemot 1:12). Eliyahu HaNavi’s students seize the opportunity and fellowship of being secluded in caves for a very extended period of time, to scale the heights of spirituality. The intense synergy of all these spiritual human resources compressed in a tiny area spurs their incredible spiritual growth. The Bnei HaNevi’im thus emerge as equals in spirituality to Eliyahu HaNavi.",

In contrast, Elisha is able to relate to all Jews, as he lived a conventional lifestyle prior to his encounter with Eliyahu HaNavi. Although he is not on the same spiritual level as Eliyahu HaNavi’s students, he does not become disconnected from humanity in a cave. Living in a cave is similar in many ways to living as a Malach, angel, detached from earthly reality. It is wonderful to rise to a level similar to a Malach, but there is a distinct disadvantage as well, in terms of being able to relate to the broader community.",

Elisha asks for this boost to propel him to the level at which he will be able to rightfully and authentically assume the leadership of the Bnei HaNevi'im.

Elisha reveals that Eliyahu HaNavi’s Tefillah is the real cause of the nation’s victory.",

Immediately after the hostilities had ended, the Satmar Rebbe emerged to once again vociferously criticize the Israeli leadership.

However, since Aram fights the totality of Am Yisrael, they fight not only against Achav and his army but also against Eliyahu HaNavi.",
                "Thus, Ralbag may be understood as saying that the combination of Eliyahu HaNavi and all for which he stands, in combination with Achav’s army, triggers Hashem’s intervention on behalf of Am Yisrael during its battles with Aram. David HaMelech has in his possession the ideal blend of military skill and faith in Hashem, and he is, therefore, able to trigger Hashem’s help to overcome Golyat. While the combination of Achav, his army, and Eliyahu HaNavi consists of different personalities, the net result is the same.

                "It is one of the most shocking incidents in Tanach. The end of Melachim II 2 records that Elisha reacts angrily when a group of “<i>Ne’arim Ketanim</i>,” young lads, taunt him by calling him a “<i>Keirei’ach</i>,” “baldhead.” Elisha reacts angrily and curses them, which in turn leads to the gruesome death of these forty-two youngsters at the hands of fearsome bears (Melachim II 2:24). This seems a severe overreaction on the part of Elisha. Why does he react in this extreme manner to a petty insult? Why does Elisha not simply take the “high road” and ignore the taunt?",
                "Moreover, we have presented Elisha as adopting a much softer approach in comparison to Eliyahu HaNavi. For example, in the incident preceding the confrontation with the taunting youngsters, Elisha cures the water of Yericho. Elisha’s first communal act as the successor to Eliyahu HaNavi is to provide water, whereas Eliyahu’s first act is to withhold water. The people of Yericho never approach Eliyahu HaNavi about the problem with the water in their area, because they find it too intimidating to do so. They do, by contrast, feel comfortable approaching Elisha.",
                "Accordingly, how does the story of Elisha and the bears fit with his image of a much softer and more approachable Navi?",

                "This seems to be an inadequate explanation, for Elisha remains unrepentant to the end for this act. There is also hardly a hint in the text that Elisha errs in this incident. Moreover, if we say Elisha errs, then it is a grievous sin that should overshadow the many great things he accomplished during his eventful life. Causing the death of forty-two small children simply for their poking fun of his being bald? If this is understood as a sinful act, it renders Elisha as a terrible sinner. We are strongly inclined to discover an alternative approach.",

Elazar says: The word “lads [Ne’arim]” means that they were shaken empty [Meno’arim] of the Mitzvot; the word “young [Ketanim]” means that they were of little faith [Ketanei Amanah], as they had no trust that they would be able to earn their livelihood by any other means. The Sages taught: They were lads, that is, already of age, but they disgraced themselves like young children.</i>",
                "This further softens Elisha’s actions. He does not curse small children. Rather, he curses adults who are, spiritually speaking, immature.",

                "This final criticism, of course, reminds us of a similar highly controversial action that occurs in the early stages of Moshe Rabbeinu’s career, when he kills the Egyptian for abusing a Hebrew slave. In both cases, Chazal partially justify the actions by noting that not an iota of goodness may be associated with the person killed (see Rashi to Shemot 12:2 s.v. VaYar Ki Ein Ish).",
                "<i><b>Understanding Elisha</b></i>",
                "As uncomfortable as we may be with this, the fact is that Elisha is destined to be involved in some violent activity. Hashem at Har Choreiv tells Eliyahu HaNavi that Elisha, along with Chaza’eil and Yeihu, will eliminate the sinners in Israel (Melachim I 19:17). Rashi (ibid.) notes that this is fulfilled when the bears devour the forty-two taunters.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">177</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It should be noted that the Pesukim relate only that forty-two of the taunters were killed by the bears. It is possible that there were more than forty-two instigators.</i> It is most reasonable to assume that Eliyahu HaNavi informs Elisha about this Nevu’ah. Presumably, given the severity of the insults, Elisha feels that this is the appropriate situation in which to fulfill this mission.",
                "Moreover, even if we may assume that these are young children, as a Peshat approach to the term<i> “Ne’arim Ketanim” </i>seems to indicate, it is reasonable to suggest that the forty-two children only express the oft-repeated sentiments originally vocalized by their parents. Indeed, the Gemara (Sukkah 56b) states that a child’s statements in public reflect what they heard either from their father or mother. These children mirror the anti-Elisha sentiment prevalent in Beit El. Such intense negativity is intolerable to Elisha, and thus he feels that he must respond harshly.",
                "Finally, Elisha does not kill these boys. He curses them. Hashem decides as to whether He will summon one of His agents to punish the taunters. This is similar to Moshe Rabbeinu who “kills” the abusive Egyptian man by uttering the Shem HaMeforash (Hashem’s ineffable name), as noted by Rashi (to Shemot 2:14 s.v. Halhargeini Ata Omeir). Had Hashem felt it unjust for the abusive Egyptian man to die or the taunters to die, they would not have died.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">178</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although there is a traditional saying that “Tzaddik Gozer VeHashem Mekayeim,” “a Tzaddik decrees and Hashem fulfills,” it is inconceivable that Hashem would fulfill an immoral request simply because the person requesting it is otherwise a Tzaddik. TABC alumnus Binyamin Jachter (’17), however, counters that he finds this approach to be untenable. This is because, as Chazal express, Eliyahu HaNavi holds the keys to water. Of course, Hashem allows everything to happen, but He chooses to base His actions on human action. The connection between the Navi’s actions and Hashem’s reaction is more pronounced in regards to Eliyahu HaNavi, but it is still in effect during Elisha’s tenure as the spiritual leader. Elisha essentially puts a death warrant on the youngsters’ heads, and Hashem accepts Elisha’s terms. To say that Hashem reacts to mystical triggers only in a manner consistent with Avodat Hashem is disingenuous. Bala’am, Balak, the magicians in Mitzrayim, and possibly even Yeishu (according to Sanhedrin 107b), manipulated Hashem’s mystics for non-Godly means. Human choice is necessary and mistakes are inevitable, even for an authentic Navi.</i>",
                "<i><b>Conclusion</b></i>",
                "In comparison to Eliyahu HaNavi, Elisha certainly adopts a softer and gentler approach in his mission to return Am Yisrael of the Northern Kingdom to Hashem. However, if he is to be taken seriously, Elisha must establish his authority and his intolerance towards abuse. The incident with the bears, which occurs at the beginning of his role as leader of the Nevi’im, firmly establishes much-needed respect for Elisha.",
                "Thus, as uncomfortable as this story may appear at first glance, when delving into the incident, one may discern why Elisha’s reaction is reasonable and appropriate.",

                "Alternatively, we may understand the bear incident as a presentation of Elisha’s grief. In order to understand Elisha’s emotional state, let us break down his story into the relevant parts. Elisha cuts himself off completely from everyone and everything that he knows to follow Eliyahu HaNavi. His mission is to be Eliyahu HaNavi’s successor and to serve Hashem to the best of his ability. His only guide through all of this, Eliyahu HaNavi, whom Elisha treats as a father, is ripped away from him suddenly, with only a day’s notice. He then is pressured during his period of mourning to accept people who deny Eliyahu HaNavi’s death/ascension (see Melachim II 2:15-17). Elisha then helps these deniers by restoring their water. The people of Yericho do not celebrate Elisha’s investiture, and they fail to acknowledge Hashem and Elisha’s role in their salvation.",
                "At this point, Elisha is alone. No one gives him or Hashem the warranted gratitude. In this emotional context, a group of youngsters comes to taunt and berate Elisha. Thus, with a very large number of people taunting and screaming at him, about something so trivial as his appearance no less, our emotionally ragged Navi curses them with his newly received power from Eliyahu HaNavi. This outburst of anger may have influenced Elisha’s actions for the rest of his life. As a result of this incident, Elisha never turns his back on the Bnei Yisrael (unlike Eliyahu HaNavi, who runs away to Choreiv following the events at Har HaCarmel, see Melachim I 19). Elisha learns a powerful lesson when he directly witnesses his anger destroy forty-two children.",
                "According to this approach, if we assume Elisha sins during this incident, Elisha does in a way repent for his egregious error. As recorded in Melachim II 3, Elisha is deeply disappointed with Yehoram ben Achav but still does as the king requests— he gives him Hashem’s Nevu’ah of victory. Elisha already, only a short while after the incident with the bears, is able to control his emotions and practice tolerance to the highest degree.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">180</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Similarly, the Gemara’s assertion that the “youngsters” are actually adults may be understood in a psychological sense. Elisha perceives them as adults due to his overwrought emotional state.</i> We see that Elisha’s temperament has changed."

                "Sometimes an archaeological find can shed light on an episode in Tanach that appears mysterious without the artifact. The Mesha Stele is an example of this.",
                "Melachim II 3 relates that in response to Moav’s rebellion against the Northern Kingdom, the Israelite king Yehoram, the son of Achav, forms a coalition with the Southern Kingdom (led by the righteous king Yehoshafat) and the king of Edom. En route to the battle, this triple alliance runs out of water. Yehoram calls upon Elisha, who joins the troops going to the battle, to miraculously provide water and rescue the three armies. Elisha speaks harshly to Yehoram, but kindly about his partner Yehoshafat. After miraculously providing water, Elisha instructs the alliance to smite Moav and engage in General Sherman-like warfare against Moav, destroying all in their path, including the fruit trees. After the army successfully executes Elisha’s plan and wreaks havoc upon Moav, the war ends inconclusively, with the alliance dissolving in a last-minute debacle.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">181</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ralbag (Melachim II 3:27) and the Malbim (ibid.) for an explanation of the obscure final verse of Melachim II 3, which presents the reason for the dissolution of the alliance. </i> Moav is left in shambles, though Yehoram’s goal of restoring his control over Moav remains unachieved.",
                "<i><b>Questions</b></i>",
                "The thoughtful reader is left with many questions regarding this episode. First, why does the righteous king Yehoshafat join this battle? Perhaps it is because his son marries Achav’s daughter Ataliah (sister of Yehoram). Indeed, Yehoshafat allies himself with Achav in his war against Aram (Melachim I 22). However, Yehoshafat narrowly escapes death in that war and thus refuses to ally himself with Achav’s son Achaziah in his quest for gold, as recorded in Melachim I 22:49-50. Why, then, does Yehoshafat join Yehoram ben Achav in his quest to regain control over Moav? Moreover, why is Elisha clearly pleased with Yehoshafat’s participation in this war? <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">182</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Similarly, Chazal (Avot DeRabbi Natan 9:4) strongly criticize Yehoshafat for partnering with Achav but do not criticize Yehoshafat for joining Yehoram’s war against Moav.</i>",
                "The second question is: Why does Elisha call for such an aggressive campaign against Moav? Furthermore, what is the justification of his order to cut down fruit trees, which violates an explicit Torah prohibition (Devarim 20:19-20)? In his introduction to the Mishnah, Rambam explains that this was a Hora’at Sha’ah<i>,</i> a temporary suspension of a Torah law, which an established prophet is permitted to do in case of great need.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">183</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A classic Hora’at Sha’ah is Eliyahu HaNavi offering a sacrifice on Har HaCarmel, as recorded in Melachim I 18. Eliyahu HaNavi does this despite the prohibition against offering a sacrifice outside the Beit HaMikdash (VaYikra 17:1-4), due to the extraordinary need to draw the Jews of the Northern Kingdom back to the Torah (Yevamot 90b). </i> Rambam does not clarify, however, the great need that called for a suspension of the Torah prohibition to cut down fruit trees.",
                "A third question is why Elisha, a prolific miracle worker, performs a miracle to save the “triple entente” from dying of thirst but does not perform a miracle to ensure a complete victory over Moav. Shouldn’t Elisha’s presence ensure an unadulterated defeat of Moav? We are left wondering why Hashem apparently does not want the coalition to achieve such a triumph.",
                "One could answer that since Yehoram ben Achav is wicked, he is undeserving of a miracle. If so, then why does the coalition merit obtaining water in a miraculous fashion? Why are the allied armies so successful in their effort to wreak havoc upon Moav? Melachim II 3 and its traditional commentaries do not provide clear answers to these three major problems.",

                " After his successful rebellion against Yehoram, Mesha erects the Mesha Stele to celebrate his victory to elevate the Moavite god Kemosh and denigrate Hashem in the most public manner possible. One may hypothesize that Mesha erected numerous such steles in his territory.",

                "Armed with this information, we may proceed to answer our three questions. Our answers are a variation of Rav Elchanan Samet’s approach presented in his monumental work <i>Pirkei Elisha.</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">187</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rav Elchanan Samet, Pirkei Elisha (Jerusalem: Ma’aliyot Press, 2007) pp. 85-118.  </i>The modifications emerge from the sharp questioning of many groups of TABC students, to whom I presented Rav Samet’s approach.",
                "Based on the Mesha Stele, it is readily understood why the righteous Yehoshafat joins the battle against Moav. Yehoshafat comes to correct the terrible Chillul Hashem (desecration of the Divine Name) created by the Moavite king Mesha, and Elisha wholeheartedly supports Yehoshafat’s decision. Despite his previous near-disastrous alliance with the Northern Kingdom, Yehoshafat is willing to take the risk in order to counter the terrible disgrace of Hashem’s name.",
                "Similarly, Elisha orders the utter devastation of Moav to demonstrate the sheer impotence of the Moavites’ false god Kemosh, and to reverse the awful Chillul Hashem created by the Mesha Stele.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">188</sup><i class=\"footnote\">TABC student Dovi Lederer (‘20) notes the similarity to the all-out war waged against Amaleik (Shemuel I 15:3). </i> This goal clearly justifies the temporary suspension of the prohibition against cutting down fruit trees. Elisha remains hostile to Yehoram due to the latter’s indifference to the Chillul HaShem created by the Mesha Stele. Yehoram ben Achav assembles a coalition and wages war against Moav simply to regain control of Moav, but his ambitions are thwarted by a shocking and successful move made in desperation by the Moavite king at the end of the battle. Therefore, although the Chillul HaShem is corrected, Yehoram’s goals remain unmet.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">189</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Mesha Stele also explains why Edom allies itself with the Jewish kings, a singular event in all of Tanach. The stele records that Moav had captured territory from the Edomites. The Edomites are clearly motivated by a desire to recover territory. </i> Both the reversal of the Chillul HaShem<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">190</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The earlier comparison to the tactics of General Sherman’s utter destruction of huge swaths of the South during the American Civil War is most appropriate. As Jean Edward Smith explains in his biography of Ulysses Grant, the Union’s goal was to demotivate the South from ever considering repeating the insurrection. The devastation had to be so vast that the South would not consider repeating the rebellion in the future. TABC student Ving Levy (’20) notes the similarity to the war against Moav. Moav has to be pummeled so that they will never consider insulting Hashem again. </i> and Yehoram’s failure to accomplish his objective are most appropriate and consistent with Torah values.",

In response, we cite Ramban’s assertion that the Torah does not present the story of Avraham Avinu’s miraculous survival of Nimrod’s fiery furnace so as not to publicize the idolatrous beliefs of Nimrod (BeReishit 11:28). Similarly, the Tanach chooses not to publicize the Chillul HaShem created by the Mesha Stele.",
                "This is analogous to the approach adopted by the authors of the Da’at Mikra Tanach commentary. The authors, Orthodox Tanach scholars who are thoroughly familiar with both the Orthodox and secular approaches to Tanach, do not mention Bible critics’ interpretations of various Tanach passages. However, the commentary does include an Orthodox response to the criticism.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">191</sup><i class=\"footnote\">TABC alumnus Nachum Krasnopolsky (‘19) notes that R. Saadia Gaon (882-942) adopts a similar approach in his poetic response to two hundred heretical questions posed by Hiwi al-Balkhi, a Jewish iconoclast deeply influenced by Zoroastrianism. A fragment of R. Saadia Gaon’s responses was found in the Cairo Genizah in the Ben Ezra Shul in Fustat (Old Cairo), Egypt. R. Saadia Gaon presents his answers but does not record Hiwi al-Balkhi’s original questions. For more information on this topic, see Adina Hoffman and Peter Cole’s Sacred Trash: The Lost and Found World of the Cairo Genizah pp. 144-148 (New York: Schocken Books, 2011).</i> Thus, for those familiar with the arguments of the Bible critics, reading the Da’at Mikra commentary provides a response, while those who are unaware of the secular critics’ claims will also find the Da’at Mikra meaningful and enriching even though they will not grasp the full extent of the goals of the commentary. The authors of the Da’at Mikra series thus achieve their goals of writing a significant commentary to Tanach and responding to biblical criticism, without needlessly publicizing anti-religious views. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">192</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rav Amnon Bazak, authoring Ad HaYom HaZeh more than a decade after the completion of the Da’at Mikra commentary, presents a frontal response to Biblical criticism. He fully presents the views of Bible critics and offers highly persuasive responses to their views.

Rav Bazak notes “the considerable historical irony in the fact that the two most ancient archaeological proofs concerning the existence of Am Yisrael—the Merneptah Stele and the Mesha Stele— both describe the annihilation of Israel: ‘Israel is laid waste and his seed is not,’ says the former, while the latter asserts, ‘Israel has perished; it has perished forever!’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">193</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ibid.</i> In fact, the only people with widespread knowledge of Moav and Kemosh are the Jews whom Mesha so brashly proclaimed were defeated forever. Israel’s survival is the greatest testament to God’s continued management of the world. As stated in the Gemara (Yoma 69b), “if not for the fear of the Almighty, how could one nation survive among so many [hostile] nations?” The continued existence and vibrancy of our people indeed constitutes a great Kiddush Hashem (sanctification of the Name).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">194</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is most interesting that the Mesha Stele has been transformed from a Chillul Hashem in its time, to a Kiddush Hashem in modern times. In the time of Mesha Melech Moav, the Mesha Stele was intended to degrade Hashem. In modern times it serves, in a dramatic ironic twist, to bolster faith in Tanach! </i>"

                "The alternative focuses on the introductory Pesukim of the chapter, which summarize the reign of Yehoram ben Achav, the royal successor to his brother Achazyahu ben Achav. Whereas the older brother Achazyahu is completely divorced from Torah and is completely influenced by his mother and father’s deviant ways, Yehoram ben Achav Melech Yisrael is a far more nuanced personality. The younger brother Yehoram is a significant spiritual improvement over Achazyahu.",

                "Melachim II 3 records that Yehoram actually removes the Ba’al idolatry introduced by his terrible parents Achav and Izevel. As noted by Da’at Mikra, Yehoram is the first king of northern Israel to remove state-sponsored Avodah Zarah. He is the first Melech Yisrael to put a halt to the steep spiritual descent into which the Northern Kingdom had been falling since the time of Yarav'am ben Nevat.",
                "Thus, from one perspective, Yehoram is a significant spiritual success. On the other hand, while he eliminates disastrous spiritual innovations introduced by his parents, he does not “go the distance” to eliminate the deleterious spiritual changes introduced by Yarav'am ben Nevat.",

                "It is clear from Melachim II 3 that Yehoram has the opportunity to lead, together with the strong support of the popular Navi Elisha and successful (and friend and royal relative of the north) Yehoshafat Melech Yehudah, a spiritual revolution that will restore the Northern Kingdom to its proper Torah roots. Yehoram can undo all of the negativity introduced by Yarav'am, but he fails to seize the opportunity. A golden opportunity slips away.",
                "Thus, we understand why Yehoshafat is eager to ally with Yehoram. After all, Yehoram makes a significant spiritual advance. Furthermore, we understand why Elisha (and later Chazal) does not chastise Yehoshafat for this alliance. In addition, in light of the background provided at the beginning of Melachim II 3, we understand why Hashem brings the triple alliance to the brink of disaster. Although Yehoram respects Elisha, and his alliance with Yehoshafat is a great spiritual development (see Radak to Melachim II 3:11), a complete spiritual revolution does not occur on a national level. Yehoram’s Teshuvah remains incomplete.",
                "This background also explains why on the one hand Elisha facilitates the great miracles of the sudden appearance of water and the destruction of Moav, while not stopping the debacle at the end of the battle on the other. The half victory and half loss is a result of Yehoram’s half Teshuvah. Hashem and Elisha communicate Eliyahu HaNavi’s message of “<i>Ad Matai Atem Posechim Al Shenei HeSi’ifim,”</i> “until when will you not serve Hashem wholeheartedly.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">195</sup><i class=\"footnote\">TABC alumnus Raanan Kilimnick (’18) brilliantly asks why we condemn Yehoram ben Achav for his half-baked Teshuvah, if we celebrate Asa (see our earlier discussion) for his partial Teshuvah. As previously noted, Asa eliminates Avodah Zarah, but not the Bamot because he feels that it is too much for the community to handle. The difference, though, is that Asa himself does not sin, and the state does not sponsor the Bamot. Asa merely wisely refrains from eliminating private sins. Yehoram, though, himself sins by maintaining and sustaining the illicit alternate state-sponsored Batei Mikdash in Beit El and Dan.

Devarim 4:30 records that “<i>BaTzar Lecha VeShavta Ad Hashem</i>,” “when we encounter trouble we will return to Hashem.” Yehoram recognizes that Hashem has placed him in a position of great difficulty.

                "This episode is exceedingly painful, as it represents perhaps the last great opportunity to bring about this unified spiritual renewal.

This idea parallels the Zohar, which teaches that Berachah cannot come from nothing; it must be founded upon something tangible. We find that both Eliyahu HaNavi and Elisha cause the oil flask (and the flour jar) to pour forth continuously to sustain the meritorious women— but they do not make it appear out of thin air. (Melachim I 17 and Melachim II 4, respectively). The Berachah has to be founded upon something already in existence. So too, one must leave over some bread at the end of the meal, so the Berachah will have something to “rest” upon.

Dovi compares the Almanah’s remaining bit of oil to the one pure jug of oil that is used to light the Menorah for the Chanukah miracle. They could have used impure oil for the Menorah (due to the idea of Tumah Hutrah/Dechuya BeTzibbur, that we may use impure material when pure items or not available) but they specifically used pure oil for the reopening of the Beit HaMikdash. The Chachamim wanted the foundation of the renewed Beit HaMikdash to stem from a pure source. So too with the widow, Elisha wants to start her new lease on life with the foundation of the pure oil that remains from the house in which her righteous husband lived, who is described in Melachim I 18:3 and 18:12 as a great “Yarei Shamayim,” one who fears God, from his youth. This approach works beautifully with the Midrash cited by Radak (to Melachim I 4:1), that the great debt was accumulated to pay for the oil to light the caves where Ovadiah hid the one hundred prophets of Hashem so that they could learn Torah at all times. Accordingly, the remaining oil in Ovadiah’s home certainly comes from a very pure source. </i>",

                "The Yam Suf, for example, could be split by Hashem, without Moshe Rabbeinu hitting the sea.

For example, it is known that many or even most people who win the lottery are unable to handle the Berachah of wealth, and, as a result, their lives become severely disrupted. Another example is the story of a Rothschild, who, when approached by a pauper for a donation, asked what the pauper would do if he were to give him a million dollars.

Most interestingly, Rambam (Hilchot Matanot Aniyim 9:3) writes that “he has never heard of or seen a Jewish community that does not maintain a charity fund.” If a Jewish community does not have such a fund, Rambam implies that it is not worthy of calling itself a Jewish community.",

                "<i><b>The Substantive Connection</b></i>",
                "While the parallels are clear, what is far from clear is the message communicated by the reading of this story as part of the Haftarah. Moreover, it is not even clear why the Navi includes this story in the Tanach. The Gemara (Megillah 14a) makes a foundational statement: each story that is recorded in the Tanach is intended to serve as a lesson for each generation. The question, then, is what learned today when we read about Elisha triggering the extraordinary miracle of the birth of the child, and his subsequent act of Techiyat HaMeitim?",
                "An intriguing discussion of Radak (Melachim II 4:16) may shed light on this issue. Radak wonders how Elisha can predict the birth of the child. One possibility, he notes, is that Elisha is informed by Hashem that the child will be born. Elisha merely conveys the divine communication to the Ishah HaShunamit.",
                "A second and far more tantalizing possibility raised by Radak is that Elisha makes the prediction without a divine communication, and anticipates that Hashem will execute the promise.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">209</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The two possibilities raised by Radak are reminiscent of the two possibilities he raises (Melachim I 18:21) as to whether the idea of the Har HaCarmel showdown was that of Hashem or Eliyahu HaNavi.</i> Radak cites a Midrash to a Pasuk we recite in the Ashrei prayer thrice daily <i>“Retzon Yerei’av Ya’aseh, Shav’atam Yishma VeYoshi’aim,”</i> “the will of those who fear Him He will do; and their cry He will hear, and save them.” A popular Jewish saying conforms to this idea, <i>“Tzadik Gozeir VeHakadosh Baruch Mekayeim</i>,” “the Tzaddik decrees and Hashem fulfills [his wish].” It also fits with the Mishnah’s (Avot 2:4) assertion that “<i>Aseh Retzono KiRetzoncha Kedei Retzoncha KiRetzono</i>,” “do His will as though it were your will so that He will do your will as though it were His.”",
                "Based on the second possibility one may raise the extraordinary possibility that the story of Elisha and the Ishah HaShunamit teaches that great Tzaddikim can trigger a blessing to send children to who struggle with conceiving a child. Innumerable stories (especially among more mystically inclined Jews such as Chassidim and Sephardim) are told of childless couples bearing children after many years of infertility. For example, Hacham Ben Tzion Abba Sha’ul and his Rabbanit were blessed with children after receiving a special blessing from the Chazon Ish, after years of multiple miscarriages.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">210</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One may wonder why great Tzaddikim, such as the Chazon Ish and his Rabbanit, were themselves unable to conceive a child. The answer may lie in the teaching of the Gemara (Berachot 5b) “a prisoner cannot free himself from prison, but depends on others to release him from his shackles.” See also the Gemara (Berachot 34b) which relates that R. Yochanan ben Zakkai asked his student R. Chanina ben Dosa to pray for his son’s recovery from illness instead of relying only on his own Tefillot on behalf of his child. </i>",
                "<i><b>A Rational Explanation</b></i>",
                "A mystical explanation for the efficacy of the Berachot is that Hashem awaits the pure and agenda-free blessings offered by genuine Tzaddikim whose purpose in life is only to serve Hashem and other people. Hashem, as we have mentioned many times, chooses to cede some control to us and allows us to trigger (to use Kabbalistic language) an awakening from above with an awakening from below.",
                "However, there may be a rational explanation as well. Dr. Jacob Markovitz, a respected Orthodox gynecologist who practices in New Jersey, shares that the first step he tells patients struggling with conception is to try any and all healthy means of achieving relaxation and relieving anxiety. This is, I have been told, a well known and very widely practiced approach. An article published in March 2018 by the National Center for Biotechnology Information concludes as follows:",
                "<i>A diagnosis of infertility can be a tremendous burden for patients. The pain and suffering of infertility patients is a major problem. Patients must be counseled and supported as they go through treatment. Although neither the American Society for Reproductive Medicine nor the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology have formal requirements for psychological counseling for infertility patients, there is acknowledgement that incorporating psychological interventions into routine practice at ART clinics is beneficial. It has been well documented that infertility causes stress. The impact of stress on ART outcome is still somewhat controversial. However, it is clear that psychological interventions for women with infertility have the potential to decrease anxiety and depression and may well lead to significantly higher pregnancy rates.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">211</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rooney, Kristin L, and Alice D Domar. “The relationship between stress and infertility.” Dialogues in clinical neuroscience vol. 20,1 (2018): 41-47.

                "Perhaps the Tzaddik’s blessings serve to calm the couple, which in turn enables the couple to conceive a child. Indeed, the Metzudat David (Melachim II 6:17) explains that a Navi will sometimes intervene merely to relieve others’ anxiety, as the anxiety itself creates a crisis. Perhaps blessings are sometimes effective in resolving a serious problem as a result of a combination of rational and mystical reasons.",
                "<i><b>Conclusion - Proliferation of Genuinely Felt Blessings</b></i>",
                "The positive impact of blessings is not restricted to great rabbinical leaders. Parents’ blessings of their children can, as implied by Shemot 5:12, lengthen the lives of their children. Kohanim’s blessings permeate Jewish life, especially in Eretz Yisrael and Sephardic congregations worldwide, where Birkat HaKohanim is practiced daily. Hashem encourages blessing each other about meaningful matters. The Gemara (Berachot 7a) states that even the blessing of an ordinary person should not be taken lightly.",
                "Accordingly, the story of the Ishah HaShunamit teaches us that a Tzaddik might also be able to trigger Hashem’s grace to bestow a child upon a long-suffering childless couple. This potential applies at times to each and every one of us. Our sincere and purely motivated Berachot to each other, and Tefillot on behalf of each other, have the potential to make a great positive impact.",
                "<i><b>Postscript – The End of the Haftarah</b></i>",
                "While Ashkenazic Jews read the entire story until its conclusion, Sephardic Jews interestingly end the Haftarah with Melachim II 4:23, when the Shunammite woman tells her husband that all is well. In addition to the inclination for Sephardic Haftarot to usually (though not always) be shorter than the Ashkenazic selections, perhaps the Sephardic tradition seeks to convey that the Ishah HaShunamit’s confidence and Bitachon that Elisha will solve the story itself is a harbinger of success. In other words, positive thinking breeds positive results. Thus, she resolutely presses Elisha to bring about this miracle, since she is confident that once he swings into action, the problem will be solved.",
                "On the other hand, the Ashkenazic tradition believes the story to be incomplete without including Geichazi’s failure. Geichazi’s failure reflects on Elisha’s success, as we have noted. We cannot comprehend Elisha’s accomplishment unless we contrast it with Geichazi’s disappointment."

                "This is rooted in the Kabbalistic concept of Tzimtzum (contraction). The Kabbalah teaches that Hashem created the world by limiting Himself, thereby making space for us in His world. We, in turn, make space for Hashem in our lives by limiting ourselves. Often the Halachah commends those who adopt a stricter position as holy or generating Berachah. This is because they adopt a mode of more limitation, which in turn creates (when done in a healthy manner) greater space for Hashem in their life.",

First, what is the logic behind Elisha’s instruction to Na’aman to immerse in the Yarden seven times to cure the latter of Tzara’at? Second, why does Elisha adamantly refuse the very generous gifts offered by Na’aman? After all, Elisha’s Yeshivot are exceedingly poor and would very much benefit from Na’aman’s largesse.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">217</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Haftarah for Parashat Tazri’a does not begin with the Elisha and Na’aman story. It starts with the preceding story (recorded at the end of Melachim II 4) which depicts the dire poverty in which Elisha and his Talmidim live. Hearing this story serves as an appropriate backdrop to the Elisha and Na’aman story, as it contributes to our understanding of the story, as we shall discuss. </i> Third, when Geichazi spurns Elisha’s policy of not taking from Na’aman, why does Elisha specifically punish Geichazi with Na’aman’s Tzara’at? How does this punishment match Geichazi’s sin?",
                "<i><b>The Yarden Cures Na’aman</b></i>",
                "Na’aman is clearly suffering from an overdose of arrogance. His Tzara’at is a physical manifestation of this spiritual deficit. Na’aman is an extraordinarily successful soldier, and in contemporary terms is the “franchise player” for Aram, the dominant regional superpower of the time. In addition, Melachim II 5:5 makes it abundantly clear that Na’aman is extraordinarily wealthy. The professional and financial success has gone to Na’aman’s head, turning him into the obnoxious, arrogant, and Tzara’at-afflicted person we find at the beginning of our story.",
                "As Na’aman approaches Elisha’s house with his horses and chariots in a show of force, Elisha does not even appear at the door. Instead, he sends a messenger to instruct Na’aman to immerse seven times in the Yarden. Refusing to meet Na’aman in person is the first step in curing Na’aman’s haughtiness.",
                "Na’aman, not surprisingly, is outraged by this instruction and proclaims that he could just have immersed in the far grander rivers located in Aram. Na’aman is talked down from his arrogant stance by his aides, who note that dipping in the Yarden might be the only cure for his Tzara’at, and that there is little downside to simply trying Elisha’s recommendation. Following this humbling instruction is the second step in curing Na’aman’s bloated ego.",
                "The Yarden is a puny river, whose southern terminus is the lowest point on Earth. Melachim II 5:14 contains the alliterative phrase <i>“VaYeired VaYitbol BaYarden</i>,<i>”</i> “and he descended and dipped in the Yarden.” The root of the word Yarden is <i>Yarad</i>, go down. Na’aman goes down to the “go down” river and immerses no less than seven times. The third step to humble Na’aman is to lower his sense of self to a more proportionate and healthier level. Once Na’aman has regained his psychological equilibrium, his Tzara’at is cured.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">218</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is likely the basis for those who have the Minhag is to dip seven times when immersing in the Mikvah.

The Malbim points, in part, to the notion of Elisha seeking to create a Kiddush Hashem.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">219</sup><i class=\"footnote\">TABC alumnus Nachum Krasnopolsky (‘19) brings attention to the Gemara (Sanhedrin 74b-75a), which uses Elisha’s encounter with Na’aman to determine whether or not the Mitzvah of Kiddush Hashem (sanctification of Hashem’s name) applies to non-Jews.</i> The Metzudat David (Melachim II 5:26) understands the refusal as stemming from Elisha’s abhorrence of deriving material benefit from the miracles he performs unless it is absolutely necessary.",
                "We suggest that Elisha’s refusal should be understood in light of the fact that Elisha, in this story, catapults from being merely a figure of national renown to a celebrity on the international stage. More than ever, Elisha is determined to spurn wealth to protect himself from falling into the trap of celebrity arrogance. His is a mission to serve others, as he emphatically expresses in his first act of slaughtering all of his oxen and feeding it to his fellow townspeople.

Geichazi longs to revel in the status of celebrity and the concomitant arrogance that often comes along with great fame. Thus, Geichazi is afflicted with Na’aman’s Tzara’at because he becomes like Na’aman before his immersion— arrogant and obnoxious.

He rescues the Almanah (widow) from the scourge of poverty, helps a childless couple have a child, and brings that same child back to life.",
                "Geichazi, however, does not inculcate this ideal. Since Geichazi's mindset is not of a giving nature, when the Almanah grabs Elisha's feet, Geichazi looks to protect Elisha's celebrity stature (and by extension his own special status as his apparent heir), instead of recognizing her special needs.

He is shaken to the core by Geichazi’s misdeed, and thus completely rejects his former student. However, it should be noted that Chazal (cited in Rashi to Melachim II 8:7) do say that Elisha later makes a valiant but unsuccessful effort to bring Geichazi back into the fold.

The students in the Yericho Yeshivah are already located at the Yarden. </i> This branch of the Eliyahu HaNavi-Elisha Yeshivah is established in the nerve center of Malchut Yisrael’s renegade religious reforms, as a bastion of spiritual outreach for Beit El.

It seems to us that there is no compelling reason for the Navi to present the Elisha stories out of chronological order. Rather, we assume that Elisha employs a string of creative means to try to cajole Yehoram ben Achav to complete Teshuvah. That is the ultimate goal of the many or varied miracles concerning Elisha recorded in Melachim II 3-8. </i> We believe that Elisha seeks to show that the Aramean soldiers are mere pawns in the hand of Hashem. He wants to demonstrate that if one is fully devoted to Hashem, there is nothing to fear from the Arameans.

Consequently, we cannot ignore the significance of the establishment of the State of Israel simply because Jews who stand a substantial distance from any form of observance of Mitzvot were in the forefront of the movements which established the State and are in the forefront of the State itself. Perhaps the fact that non-observant Jews are in the forefront today is a penalty for Orthodox Jewry’s failure to play the most important part in the formation of the State.</i>",
                "We may add to Rav Aharon Soloveichik’s insight that the four lepers are not the only spiritually deficient beneficiaries and triggers of the miracles. The Israelite leadership is awash with either outright deniers or doubters of Elisha. Even the Israelite king also harbors sharply ambivalent feelings towards Elisha, as is evident from Melachim II 6:31 and 7:12.",
                "<i><b>Stronger Enemies Flee Due to Loud Noise</b></i>",
                "After the Metzora’im decide to surrender to the Arameans, Hashem causes the Aramean camp to hear “<i>Kol Rechev, Kol Sus, Kol Chayil</i>,” “the sound of the chariot, the sound of the horse, [and] the sound of a great army” (Melachim II 7:6). The Aramean army misinterprets this noise as an attack by the Egyptian and Hittite armed forces and therefore flees in panic from the hapless Bnei Yisrael of the city of Shomeron. The parallel to Israel’s War of Independence is striking. During this war, as is well known and documented, Israel had (especially at the onset of hostilities) a severe shortage of armaments, especially heavy artillery. However, it did develop the Davidka, a home-made artillery piece that was largely ineffective but made a great amount of noise:",
                "<i>The battles raged for months, until the spring of 1948, several days before Israel was declared a State. In late April, an artillery piece, nicknamed \"The Davidka\" was delivered to the Jews. They shot it off several times, but the mortars did little damage.....the main effect was the tremendous noise. However, the weather changed, and, unusually for that time of year, it began to rain. The rumor quickly spread through the Arab community that the Jews had acquired the atom bomb, and the entire Arab community left that night. With their exit, morale deteriorated among the Arab troops, and the Haganah was able to secure the city.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">237</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“War of Independence in Tzfat.” The City of Tzfat, www.safed.co.il/war-of-independence-in-tzfat.html.</i></i>",
                "Thus, the connection to the Haftarah is obvious. A very loud noise is grossly misinterpreted by our much stronger enemy, and the enemy flees due to its irrational fear of the noise, leading to our liberation from a mortal threat. There are numerous other stories told of Arab forces fleeing during Israel’s War of Independence due to their leader’s extreme exaggeration of the Jewish forces’ capabilities.",
                "<i><b>A Siege of the Capital City</b></i>",
                "Another striking similarity is that in both situations, the capital cities of the area have a fierce siege set upon them with very serious threats of starvation. The Arabs succeeded in setting siege upon Jerusalem in 1948, and as a result, the serious threat of starvation loomed heavily upon the city. It was only the against all odds successful completion of the “Burma Road” to Jerusalem that broke the siege.",
                "<i><b>Marred Miracles</b></i>",
                "Another much more uncomfortable and sobering parallel lurks between the Aramean siege and Yom HaAtzma’ut. In Melachim II 7, Elisha intercedes and facilitates a miracle on behalf of the beleaguered Bnei Yisrael of Shomeron. However, it is far from a “neat” or “clean” miracle. Much intense suffering ensues before and after the miraculous rescue of Shomeron.",
                "The people of Shomeron experience bitterly intense starvation to the extent that mothers eat the flesh of their children (Melachim II 6:28-29)! Even after the great redemption from the Aramean forces, crowds who hurriedly race to the food and wealth left by the Aramean army trample a leading official to death. The otherwise joyful celebration is marred by this ugly incident.",
                "The parallel is a most difficult but important one to contemplate. Our victory in Israel’s War of Independence was undoubtedly miraculous. However, the suffering endured in victory was immense. One percent of Israel’s population fell. The damage to property was incalculable. Although the victory in the War of Independence was a cause for great joy, considering the very heavy losses that were sustained, there was hardly jubilation in the air at war’s end.",
                "Shomeron’s miracle rescue is marred by the region’s spiritual deficiencies. While years of outreach by Eliyahu HaNavi and Elisha make some improvements, most of the northern Bnei Yisrael are still severely deficient. The same may be said, we believe, about Israel in the wake of its astounding victory in its first war.",
                "<i><b>Improvement Needed</b></i>",
                "The suffering endured by the people of Shomeron is intended as a reminder that although Hashem intervenes to save the people of Shomeron, much spiritual improvement is still needed within the Northern Kingdom. Although it is difficult for us to note this, in linking this Haftarah to Yom HaAtzma’ut, Hashem communicates a similar message.",
                "Unfortunately, the northern Bnei Yisrael fail to internalize this message— the Northern Kingdom is destroyed approximately one hundred and fifty years after the miracle at Shomeron. This is a heavy message to consider, but we dare not repeat the behavior of the northern Bnei Yisrael, who ignore the spiritual message inherent in their marred miracle.",
                "<i><b>Conclusion</b></i>",
                "It is important to note the Tanach parallels that reassure us that Hashem has brought a great miracle for us by the creation of the State of Israel. However, it is the prudent course of action to also consider the Mussar (rebuke) and warning the contemporary parallels to Tanach communicate to us, even in times of celebration.",
                "May we internalize the message of this Haftarah, and thereby merit seeing the development of Medinat Yisrael into a society worthy of receiving the Melech HaMashi’ach with open arms."

                "During this magnificent tour, we arrived at the Tel Dan Stele. A stele is an ancient monument; this monument was erected by the Aramean king Chaza’eil, a figure who plays a significant role in Sefer Melachim.

                "Our relative, though, quietly said to us that it is not so simple since there is a contradiction between the Tel Dan Stele and Tanach. The Stele indicates that the Aramean king killed both the Israelite king Yehoram son of Achav and the Judean king, Achazyahu son of Ataliah and Yehoram. Melachim II 9:14-27 records that the Aramean king Chaza’eil only wounds Yehoram, and that Yeihu subsequently kills Yehoram and Achazyahu.",
                "<i><b>Resolving the Contradiction</b></i>",
                "At the time, we did not know how to respond. However, upon investigation, we discovered that one could reconcile this contradiction. When Chaza’eil wounds Yehoram, he gives Achazyahu the opportunity to visit the Israelite king (Melachim II 8:29). This, in turn, gives Yeihu the opportunity to kill both Yehoram and Achazyahu. Yeihu kills both of them, and Chaza’eil takes the credit.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">241</sup><i class=\"footnote\">TABC alumnus Binyamin Jachter (‘17) adds that by wounding Yehoram, the king of Aram weakens Yehoram to the extent where he is unable to carefully analyze and neutralize the situation that leads to his and Achazyahu’s deaths (as described in Melachim II 9). </i>",
                "In the ancient world, it was common for ancient kings to exaggerate their victories and ignore their losses. Napoleon reportedly remarked that “History is always written by the winners. When two cultures clash, the loser is obliterated, and the winner writes the history books— books which glorify their own cause and disparage the conquered foe.” The Tanach differs fundamentally in many ways from its counterparts in the ancient world, LeHavdil, but especially in this manner. The Tanach records the failings of Am Yisrael and its leaders often at great length, such as in Sefer Yirmiyahu, which spans no less than fifty-two chapters.",
                "Thus, it is most reasonable to resolve the contradiction by attributing historic accuracy to the Tanach, and a moderate dose of exaggeration on the part of Chaza’eil Melech Aram. This is quite a reasonable conclusion, regarding which one does not have to arrive at based on faith alone.",
                "<i><b>Conclusion</b></i>",
                "A few years ago, a letter to the editor appeared in a local secular Jewish newspaper, in which the writer made the bold assertion that archaeology proves the Tanach to be historically inaccurate.

                "<i><b>Yehoram ben Achav’s Replacement?</b></i>",
                "In Melachim II 9:1-3, Elisha directs one of the Bnei HaNevi’im (who Chazal identify as Yonah ben Amitai) to anoint Yehu ben Nimshi as king over the Northern Kingdom. Considering the fact that Yehoram ben Achav removes the state-sponsored Avodah Zarah from the land (Melachim II 3:2), why does Elisha consider Yeihu a step forward from Yehoram ben Achav?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">243</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Asked by TABC student Ephraim Helfgot (‘20). </i> After all, both of these kings of northern Israel fail to remove the Bamot, the forbidden altars established by Yarav’am ben Nevat in Beit El and Dan (Melachim II 3:3 and 10:29). Accordingly, what does Elisha accomplish by removing Yehoram ben Achav, and replacing him with Yeihu?",
                "<i><b>A More Thorough Effort</b></i>",
                "As a first response, we note that while Yehoram ben Achav eliminates state-sponsored Avodah Zarah, he does not compel individuals members of Am Yisrael to abandon this illicit worship, as is clear from Melachim II 10. This Perek records how Yeihu zealously eradicates Ba’al from Malchut Yisrael on a massive level. Thus, Yeihu drastically alters the spiritual landscape, while Yehoram is more passive in his efforts to remove Avodah Zarah.",
                "<i><b>Hashem’s Mandate</b></i>",
                "More important, though, is to bear in mind that Hashem mandates Yeihu’s appointment during His encounter with Eliyahu HaNavi at Har Choreiv (Melachim I 19). Eliyahu HaNavi, in turn, hands this mandate to Elisha for a variety of reasons, as we discussed in an earlier chapter.",
                "<i><b>Elisha’s Mission</b></i>",
                "Elisha strives mightily to help Yehoram ben Achav return fully to Hashem. He hopes that Yehoram’s complete Teshuvah will prompt Hashem to repeal the decree against his family issued to Achav in Melachim I 21. While Achav’s limited Teshuvah defers the destruction of his family to the next generation, Yehoram and his brother Achazyahu still have an opportunity to perform Teshuvah as well.",
                "Unfortunately, Achazyahu ben Achav is quickly eliminated due to his outrageous sins. The Omri dynasty is given one last opportunity at spiritual recovery, in the personage of Yehoram ben Achav. Yehoram ben Achav is a significant improvement over his father and a dramatic improvement over his brother. His rules for twelve years, a duration that stands in contrast with the relatively short reigns of the other more wayward kings of the Northern Kingdom. However, Hashem’s decree to eviscerate Achav’s family still looms large over the Omri family.",
                "Hashem extends extra time to Yehoram, in the hope that he will utilize the opportunity to fully return to Him. Elisha tries to reach him and the rest of Malchut Yisrael in many different ways. However, time runs out, and Elisha realizes that the window of opportunity has closed.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">244</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Bnei HaNevi’im try to communicate this message to Elisha when they insist on moving to the Yarden (Melachim I 6), as we discussed the earlier chapter, “The Lost Axe Blade.” </i>",
                "Elisha now executes his mandate to anoint Chaza’eil over Aram, who will wreak havoc amongst Am Yisrael,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">245</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Elisha successfully limits the damage, as we discussed in the chapter “The Appointments of Chaza’eil, Yeihu, and Elisha.”</i> and orders Yeihu’s anointment, who will eliminate Beit Achav.",
                "<i><b>Elisha’s Disappointment</b></i>",
                "A variety of explanations are offered as to why Elisha appoints his student to anoint Yeihu and hand him his mission to destroy the house of Achav. Up until this point, Elisha has been heavily invested in trying to motivate Yehoram ben Achav to completely return to Hashem. Elisha must be profoundly disappointed after he realizes that his efforts have failed. It is far too painful for him to place in motion the order to eliminate Beit Omri, and instead delegates the role to his student. It should be noted that Chazal’s identification of this student as Yonah ben Amitai is rather apt, as it is he who so fully champions the Middat HaDin (Hashem’s Attribute of Strict Justice) in the story of Nineveh’s looming destruction, as recorded in Sefer Yonah.",
                "<i><b>Elisha’s Retirement</b></i>",
                "It is for this same reason that Elisha does not engage with the quite imperfect kings of the Yeihu dynasty. In fact, the only time Elisha interacts with a member of the Yeihu family is on his deathbed, with Yeho’ash, Yeihu’s grandson.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">246</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Moreover, the deathbed interaction between Elisha and Yo’ash is a difficult one, with Elisha becoming infuriated with Yo’ash. </i> For the combined length of Yeihu and his son Yeho’achaz’s reigns (at least forty-one years), Elisha exclusively focuses on his students and his outreach efforts to the faithful, like the Shunamite woman.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">247</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to Seder Olam, Elisha dies in the tenth year of Yo’ash’s reign. This makes the length of Elisha’s retirement fifty-one years!</i>",
                "Elisha is so disappointed in Yehoram ben Achav’s failure to repent, that he can no longer bear to engage in outreach with the political leadership. Only on his deathbed does he relent and ever so briefly engage Yo’ash ben Yeho’achaz.",
                "<i><b>Conclusion – Pokeid Avon Avot Al Banim</b></i>",
                "A recurring theme in Sefer Melachim is the notion of “<i>Pokeid Avon Avot Al Banim</i>” (Shemot 20:5), that Hashem revisits the sins of a parent when a child continues in the parent’s sinful path.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">248</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As noted by Targum Onkelos and Rashi to Shemot 20:5. </i> Ramban (ibid.) indicates that this applies even when the child is not as sinful as his or her parent. For example, the last king of the Northern Kingdom, Hoshei’a ben Eilah, is less sinful than his predecessors. Yet, Hashem destroys Malchut Yisrael in Hoshei’a’s day due to the accumulated sins of those who preceded him.",
                "Tzidkiyahu, the last king of Yehudah, has serious shortcomings but sins significantly less than his predecessors Achaz, Menashe, and Yehoyakim. Yet, once again, the Churban occurs in his day due to the sins accumulated through the prior generations.",
                "The same applies to Yehoram ben Achav. He is definitely an improvement over his father and brother. Nevertheless, the accumulated sins of his family, together with his shortcomings, result in the most violent end to his reign and family.",
                "Unfortunately, the Yeihu dynasty also amasses many misdeeds, to the extent that the line ends after four generations (as predicted in Melachim II 10:30). Of course, this is a reflection of the rest of Shemot 20:5, which states that Hashem revisits a parent’s sins for four generations.",
                "Hashem is an “<i>Erech Apayim</i>,” One who is slow to punish, but there are limits to His expressions of mercy. Eventually, some measure of justice must prevail. Thus, both Yehoram ben Achav and Yeihu ben Nimshi are, either personally or through their descendants, eventually held accountable for their spiritual shortcomings."

Melachim II 16:18 states <i>“Ve’Et Mevo HaMelech HaChitzonah Heiseiv Beit Hashem Mipenei Melech Ashur,\" </i>“[Achaz] routed the king’s outer entrance to go directly to the House of Hashem, out of fear of the king of Assyria.” Simply put, Achaz is rightfully terrified of the emerging Assyrian empire lead by Tiglat Pileser, who is specifically mentioned Melachim II 16.",
                "The Assyrians were extremely competent and extremely cruel warriors. Their terrifying cruelty is displayed on the Lachish reliefs, which depict the Assyrian conquest of the Judean city of Lachish (Melachim II 18:14). The reliefs pictured below are currently on display at the British Museum. They depict the Assyrians flaying the leaders of Lachish. The ferocity of the Assyrians is also evident from the utter decimation of the palace in Lachish, of which nothing but its simple base remains.",

                "<i><b>Pekach ben Remalyahu and the King of Aram</b></i>",
                "Towards the end of the reign of Yotam (Achaz’s father), Pekach ben Remalyahu (the king of the Northern Kingdom) and the king of Aram form a coalition to fight Assyria (end of Melachim II 15 with Da’at Mikra). They demand that Yotam and later his son Achaz join the coalition to fight the newly emerging Assyrians.",
                "Achaz wisely refuses to join the coalition, since he rightly fears to engage the overwhelmingly powerful and cruel Assyrians. The king of Aram and Pekach ben Remalyahu attack Achaz in an attempt to replace him with a leader named Ben Toval, who would subsequently join the coalition to fight Assyria (Yeshayahu 7:1-6 with Da’at Mikra).",
                "<i><b>Assyrian Influences — A Peshat Explanation of Achaz</b></i>",
                "Achaz is now caught between a rock and a hard place. He fears Assyria and the coalition of Pekach and Aram. He fears that his kingdom will be overrun by either foe. The only reasonable practical option in Achaz’s mind is to cave and form an alliance with the Assyrians.",
                "Achaz prepares for the full-fledged alliance by introducing some idolatry and Assyrian cultural influences into the Beit Hamikdash. In doing this, Achaz hopes that Assyria will treat Yehudah as a vassal state and leave them be. Achaz believes that this is the only way the Southern Kingdom can survive the Assyrian challenge. Thus, he bribes Tiglat Pileser who subsequently destroys Aram and exiles much of the Northern Kingdom. Achaz then introduces a Syrian style Mizbei’ach into the Beit HaMikdash, putting the old Mizbei’ach to the side.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">264</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Interestingly, the already idolatry-prone Northern Kingdom does not adopt such a pro-Assyrian stance to avoid Assyrian invasion. </i>",
                "Achaz, we posit, therefore, is not denied a place in Olam HaBa. Unlike Achav and Menashe, he is not described by the Navi as worshipping Avodah Zarah to simply to “anger” Hashem. Achaz’s decision to introduce idolatry into the land is not frivolous, but rather the result of a very reasonable fear.",
                "Moreover, Achaz never persecutes Yeshayahu HaNavi, unlike Yarav’am ben Nevat, Achav, and Menashe, who all persecute authentic Nevi’im. Yeshayahu HaNavi publicly criticizes Achaz (Yeshayahu 7 with Da’at Mikra), and even though Achaz ignores the prophet, he does not persecute him. In light of all of these mitigating factors, Achaz is not denied a place in Olam HaBa.",
                "<i><b>Achaz is Nonetheless a Rasha</b></i>",
                "Why then do Sefer Melachim and Divrei HaYamim characterize Achaz in such a negative light? What alternative does Achaz have?",
                "The answer is apparent from Yeshayahu 7. Yeshayahu, in his characteristically beautiful Hebrew poetics, instructs Achaz <i>“Hishameir VeHashkeit,\"</i> “to stand guard and settle down.” Da’at Mikra explains that Yeshayahu advises Achaz to remain vigilant and take all prudent steps to protect Yehudah from the invasion of Pekach and the Aramaean king— <i>“HiShameir.”</i> On the other hand, Yeshayahu advises him <i>“Hashkeit,\"</i> to remain calm, and not act rashly by capitulating to Assyria.",
                "Yeshayahu reassures Achaz that Pekach and Aram do not pose a mortal threat to his kingdom. Moreover, the Navi warns Achaz that he will bring ruin to Yehudah if he welcomes the Assyrians. In the elegant but stern words of Yeshayahu, <i>“Im Lo Ta’aminu Ki Lo Te’omeinu,\"</i> “if you do not believe this, it is because you lack faith” (Yeshayahu 7:9). If you will not trust in Hashem, then the Assyrians will bring ruin to the land.",
                "Thus, had he trusted in Hashem, Achaz could have successfully held off the invasion of Pekach and Aram and avoided an alliance with Assyria. Unfortunately, Achaz, to the long-term detriment of our people, fails to heed the wise and prophetic words of Yeshayahu.",
                "<i><b>Achaz as a Prototype of Future Spiritual Failures</b></i>",
                "Achaz’s stance constitutes a major spiritual failure, but is not sufficiently egregious to result in the loss of his portion in Olam HaBa. His actions set a precedent for Jews who spiritually cave upon confronting awesome challenges. Future examples include those who argued we must bow to Haman, and the Mityavnim (Hellenizers), who argued that we must capitulate to the Syrian-Greek Antiochus or be utterly destroyed.",
                "Similar stances were taken by those who arrived in the United States in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century and were faced with the grim reality of a six-day workweek. Employers sternly warned Jewish employees that if they would not work on Shabbat, they should not bother returning to work the following Monday. Many Jews succumbed to the financial pressure. Those who exhibited a strong sense of faith held strong, and their progeny mostly remain within the fold today.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">265</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This author stands in awe of his grandfather and namesake, Chaim Adler, for his steadfast refusal to yield to enormous challenges. During a time when the United States government did not offer welfare and social security programs, he never violated Shabbat, despite his financial responsibilities towards his wife and five small children.</i>",
                "<i><b>Conclusion</b></i>",
                "Yeshayahu calls to Achaz to transcend the temporal circumstances and plug into eternity. The Assyrian empire rose and fell, and while it blazed a mighty trail for a while, there is barely a remnant of Assyria in the world today. The same goes for the Persian Empire, the Greek Empire, Crusaders, the Spanish Inquisition, Nazis, and Soviets. All these mighty forces sought to eliminate Judaism. And yet, it is they who have been vastly eliminated.",
                "Torah Judaism, despite being the vast underdog in all of these situations, remains strong and vibrant today. The Torah is eternal as it is a reflection of the Eternal. Achaz and his successors adopt what appears to be a “pragmatic” approach, which in the long run leads to self-destruction. Achaz is replaced by his son Chizkiyahu, who adopts a radically different approach, and serves as a model for those who plug into eternity and remain faithful to Torah, no matter how difficult the circumstances."

                "<i><b>A Treasure Trove of Artifacts</b></i><b><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">266</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A tremendous thank you to Shaarei Orah congregant Dr. Shimon Steiner for helping in the formulation of the ideas in this chapter. </i></b>",
                "No other figure in Tanach has nearly as many surviving and discovered artifacts as does Chizkiyahu HaMelech. The tunnels he dug to divert the waters of the Gichon to flow within the city of Jerusalem have survived intact, and are visited by many thousands each year. The inscription at the midway point of the tunnel has been discovered (and is now on display at a museum in Istanbul).",
                "His bulla (royal seal) and the seal of many of his top advisors have been discovered. There is concrete evidence of his campaign to destroy the Bamot. An ancient Assyrian artist’s (commissioned by Sancheirev) depiction of the Assyrian conquest of Lachish is preserved (and now displayed at the British Museum in London). The wide wall he built to protect Yerushalayim from the Assyrian invasion remains in part and is readily viewed by visitors to the Jewish quarter of Jerusalem’s Old City. Chizkiyahu’s name features prominently in the Sannecherib Prism which has also survived and is on display at Chicago’s Oriental Museum. In Lachish, there is also evidence of broken Bamot from Chizkiyahu’s time. There are squared off alters there, with all of their corners smashed off, unfit for any Korban to be brought upon them.",
                "Just in June 2019, the discovery of a military lookout tower from the time of Chizkiyahu was announced, adding to an already impressive trove of great findings from this great king’s reign.",
                "<i><b>Coincidence?</b></i>",
                "One could argue that the discovery of so many artifacts relevant to Chizkiyahu HaMelech is just a random phenomenon, especially since precious little from the ancient world has survived, and precious little of what has survived has been excavated. Moreover, the discoveries of major artifacts, such as the celebrated Tel Dan Stele, have been serendipitous events.",

                "We suggest that these discoveries are a result of Chizkiyahu HaMelech’s destruction of the Nachash HaNechoshet (Melachim II 18), the copper snake built by Moshe Rabbeinu at the behest of Hashem (BeMidbar 21).",
                "Chizkiyahu is never criticized within the Tanach for destroying the Nachash HaNechoshet. The Mishnah (Pesachim 4:9) records that the Chachamim of the time extended their hearty approval of Chizkiyahu’s bold action. Chazal (Chullin 7a) express their strong approval as well. Sefer Melachim explains that over time, the Nachash HaNechoshet degenerated into a shrine for Avodah Zarah. Thus, Chizkiyahu deems it necessary to grind up this priceless relic in his campaign to rid the Southern Kingdom of Avodah Zarah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">267</sup><i class=\"footnote\">TABC alumnus Binyamin Jachter (‘17) notes that the Nachash HaNechoshet was originally intended to remind the nation of Hashem. The Gemara (Rosh HaShanah 29a) records that people would look up to the snake, thinking that it would heal them, but once they looked up to the heavens they would remember Hashem and His sovereignty. Those who lacked recognition of Hashem as the true God (i.e. the idolaters) would look up at the Nachash HaNechoshet and would only see a healing copper snake. They would not realize its original purpose. This is how Rambam describes the origin of Avodah Zarah. Rambam writes (Hilchot Avodat Kochavim 1:1) that Avodah Zarah emerged when people thought that it was fitting to praise and glorify the luminaries, as Hashem honored them by making them His servants. However, as time progressed, people mistakenly thought that they were fulfilling the will of Hashem by directing sacrifices to the luminaries. Thus, as it is a Mitzvah to rid the land of Avodah Zarah (Devarim 7:5), Chizkiyahu HaMelech is justified in his removal of the Nachash HaNechoshet. </i>",
                "Hashem’s signature “fingerprint” is “<i>Middah KeNeged Middah</i>,” rewarding and punishing in a commensurate manner with the deed. We suggest that Hashem has rewarded Chizkiyahu for his bold and probably contemporaneously unpopular move in his zeal to uphold the Torah. Since Chizkiyahu eliminates an incredibly important artifact at the right time for the right reason, Hashem preserves many artifacts relating to Chizkiyahu for future generations.",
                "Chizkiyahu HaMelech has emerged in our generation as almost tangible. We can see and sometimes even touch the remains of his impactful reign. We believe that this is by Hashem’s design as a very special reward to Chizkiyahu for a very special action.",

Ravshakeh outlines the reasons why the Jews stand no chance against the fearsome Assyrian army. Ravshakeh’s blasphemy escalates throughout his speech and leads Chizkiyahu’s three top advisors, who were sent to speak with Ravshakeh, to perform Keriah, the ritual tearing of clothes performed as an act of mourning. Upon hearing the contents of the speech, Chizkiyahu tears his clothes as well.",
                "Da’at Mikra explains that Ravshakeh engages in psychological warfare designed to foment an uprising amongst the Jews against Chizkiyahu. Ravshakeh is a master orator, and is clearly a highly competent component of the well-oiled Assyrian military machine. His mastery of the Judean dialect of Hebrew allows him to impact the masses, as he does not speak in the international diplomatic lingua franca of Aramaic, which only the top echelons of leadership had mastered at that time.",
                "He clearly grasps Jewish life, as he even castigates Chizkiyahu for removing the Bamot. From the perspective of Jewish commoners, the removal of the Bamot is indeed a sinful act, as hundreds of years of habituation to Bamot erroneously made them not only appear permissible, but even virtuous.",
                "Chazal (cited by Rashi to Melachim II 18:22) understand that Ravshakeh is an apostate Jew. However, it is possible that he is an Assyrian who has learned much about his Jewish foes, not unlike Adolf Eichmann (Yimach Shemo), who was quite knowledgeable about Jewish life.",

Accordingly, it is difficult to understand why Sefer Melachim grants a large chunk of space to record Ravshakeh’s missive in all of its gory details.

                "<i><b>Do Not Answer Him!</b></i>",

Remaining silent lets the matter deescalate.",

As Ravshakeh notes in Melachim II 18:23-24, the Jewish army cannot compete even with a small subdivision of the Assyrian military.",

                "Ravshakeh’s speech serves as stark testimony to the terror under which the Jews of Jerusalem lived during the Assyrian siege. It is a great testimony to Chizkiyahu’s tremendous Bitachon (trust in Hashem). It is no wonder that Ralbag (Melachim II 18:5) ranks Chizkiyahu HaMelech’s Bitachon above even that of David HaMelech.",
                "<i><b>Response to Chillul Hashem</b></i>",
                "Finally, Ravshakeh’s speech, along with Sancheirev’s letter to Chizkiyahu HaMelech (recorded in Melachim II 19), help explain why Hashem performs the extraordinary miracle of the overnight elimination of the Assyrian army, often referred to as “the great smite.” After all, as we will explain further in a later chapter, the Jews of the rest of Yehudah do not deserve to be saved from Sancheirev and his murderous army. Yeshayahu HaNavi explains that while Chizkyahu HaMelech’s religious restoration eliminates Avodah Zarah and increases Torah study and other observance of religious ritual, the people are still deficient in their interpersonal interactions (Yeshayahu 1).",
                "The severe Chillul Hashem inherent in Ravshakeh’s denigrating speech serves as a major reason for Hashem’s dramatic intervention in the form of the great smite of the Assyrian army. Da’at Mikra notes that this is the first time an open miracle of this magnitude occurs since the days of Moshe Rabbeinu and Yehoshua. Ravshakeh’s speech serves as the impetus for this dramatic moment of divine intervention.",
                "Perhaps this also explains why Hashem did not intervene in such a manner to save Am Yisrael from the Babylonians in 586 BCE. Apparently, the Babylonians did not send someone like Ravshakeh to disgrace Hashem and our people. Thus, the fall of Jerusalem in 586 BCE did not constitute nearly the Chillul Hashem that would have ensued had Yerushalayim fallen to the Assyrians in 701 BCE.",

Hashem intervenes in a time when the very fate of the Jewish future is at stake to ensure that His promise that the Bnei Yisrael will be an eternal people will be fulfilled."

                "<i><b>The Misguided Resolution</b></i>",
                "The tour guide, who was wearing a Kippah and seem to present himself as an Orthodox Jew, offered an appalling resolution of the discrepancies. He said that both documents seek to promote their respective deities. Sancheirev promotes his god by describing his siege on Jerusalem in positive terms, as does the Jewish version.",
                "<i><b>A Rebuttal</b></i>",
                "Upon hearing this emerge from the guide, I was tempted to engage the guide in a debate, but my three children urged restraint. They wisely felt it would ignite an unhealthy and ineffective confrontation, and that I would be intruding on another institution’s educational setting. I did, however, soon afterward write to a senior faculty member from that school noting my concern that an Orthodox institution would present to their students the notion that the Tanach is distorted to aggrandize our God, without even including a traditional alternative understanding. The faculty member shared my dismay and promised to address the situation with the school’s administration.",
                "The substantial response is as follows: Sancheirev’s record of his military exploits contains, as is typical of ancient royal records, only flattering records of his campaigns. The Tanach is unique in that it records our failings and flaws in a brutally honest fashion. As noted by Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">277</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his commentary to BeReishit 12:10-13. </i> the fact that the Torah records the faults and fiascos of its heroes and people is an expression of its authenticity.",
                "For example, Melachim I 18 records the devastation wreaked upon Yehudah by Sancheirev’s invasion of the region. Each year on Shabbat Chazon, we read Yeshayahu HaNavi’s report of the utter destruction caused by the Assyrian conquest: “<i>Atzechem Shemama, Areichem Serufot Eish</i>,” “your country is desolate; your cities are burned with fire” (Yeshayahu 1:7). Had the Tanach been distorted to glorify Hashem (heaven forfend), why would it record this terrible destruction in addition to the later and greater Babylonian destruction?",
                "<i><b>Resolving the Contradiction</b></i>",
                "Da’at Mikra provides a compelling synthesis of Sefer Melachim and the Sennacherib Prism. Sancheirev boasts that he trapped Chizkiyahu like a bird, which clearly fits with the vivid description of the Assyrian siege in Melachim I 18-19. However, while it does specifically state that he conquered forty-six Judean cities, the Sennacherib Prism does not record that Sancheirev actually conquered Yerushalayim.",
                "Sancheirev is loath to record his retreat and great loss in Jerusalem, and his omission of its conquest in his annals speaks volumes. Moreover, he decorated his palace in Nineveh with huge bas reliefs of his conquest of Judah’s second most prominent city, Lachish (as recorded in Melachim I 18:14). These bas reliefs are currently on display at the British Museum in London, and a replica is hung on the walls of the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">278</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the earlier chapter “Achaz and the Assyrians — Can We Find a Way to Excuse Him?” for a photograph of a portion of the reliefs. </i>",
                "Why did Sancheirev make such a big deal about his conquest of Lachish? Had he conquered Jerusalem, wouldn’t have he made a big deal of his conquest of the much more prominent city of Jerusalem? Rather, the grandiose display of his conquest of Lachish serves as mighty testimony of his failure to subdue Jerusalem, in agreement with that which is recorded in Melachim II 19.",
                "<i><b>Conclusion</b></i>",
                "In the Modern Orthodox community, we believe in exposing our children to not only Torah sources, but also to other worthwhile material. When studying Tanach, it is indeed of value to expose students to external sources that enrich our understanding of its powerful spiritual messages. However, it is quite another thing to hire an authoritative figure who presents the Tanach as “biased” and inaccurate (Chas VeShalom), without even presenting a traditional Torah response. With the aid of tools such as the Da’at Mikra commentary, we can and must do better."

            "Chizkiyahu's Missing Song": [
                "<i><b>The Missing Song</b></i>",
                "It very much stands out! Hashem had just made an extraordinary miracle for Chizkiyahu, one not seen since the time of Moshe Rabbeinu and Yehoshua, by smiting the 185,000 Assyrian soldiers on the first night of Pesach to save Yerushalayim from the Assyrians’ vicious conquest. Yet where is the outpouring of song and gratitude to Hashem? The silence of the Pesukim is utterly deafening! Chazal (Sanhedrin 94a) were keenly aware of this lacuna:",
                "<i>The Holy One, Blessed be He, sought to designate Chizkiyahu HaMelech as the Mashi’ach and to designate Sancheirev and Assyria, respectively, as Gog and Magog, all from the prophecy of Yechezkeil with regard to the end of days (Yechezkeil 38), and the confrontation between them would culminate in the final redemption. However, this idea was dismissed since Chizkiyahu failed to burst out in grateful song after the miraculous rescue from the Assyrian siege.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">279</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See, though, Pesachim 117a, which records that Chizkiyahu did recite Hallel upon the fall of Sancheirev’s besieging army. Perhaps the Gemara condemns Chizkiyahu HaMelech for inadequately thanking Hashem for a miracle whose scale had not been seen since the time of Moshe Rabbeinu and Yehoshua bin Nun. </i></i>",
                "<i><b>The Reason He Does Not Sing</b></i>",
                "It is very easy to understand why Chizkiyahu HaMelech does not lead the nation in song. Presumably, it is because of the vast devastation wrought by the Assyrians throughout Yehudah, save for Jerusalem. Following this utter destruction, no one is in the mood to sing.",
                "A visit to the remains of the destroyed palace in Lachish sheds much light on this episode. The Lachish palace was the second biggest palace of the time, after Chizkiyahu’s in Yerushalayim. Looking at the ruins of this governor’s palace in Lachish, one can see an example of the scope of the devastation Sancheirev’s army had caused throughout all of Eretz Yisrael. Although Chizkiyahu’s life is spared, after the Assyrian devastation of Judah, he is not left with much to rule. Chizkiyahu is almost comparable to a king without a kingdom.",
                "In that great moment of salvation, Chizkiyahu could choose to either act in an optimistic or pessimistic manner. He could be thankful for and emphasize the good that had befallen him, or he could focus on the destruction of his people and kingdom. Sadly, he chose the pessimistic option.",
                "However, Chizkiyahu HaMelech is held accountable for this mistake. He could have rallied the nation to make something great out of something terrible. He could have and should have transformed the vast devastation into the prelude to the Messianic redemption. However, Chizkiyahu failed to capitalize on this rare opportunity and thus lost the nomination for Mashi’ach.",
                "<i><b>Chizkiyahu Preceded Yechezkeil!</b></i>",
                "TABC students, however, raised a serious difficulty with this Gemara. How could have Chizkiyahu known about the Milchemet Gog UMagog if Yechezkeil lived considerably later than Chizkiyahu HaMelech?",
                "We suggest that while Yechezkeil formally recorded the idea, the notion of great suffering preceding redemption already appears in the Chumash.

                "Melachim II 18:7 states that “Hashem was always with him [Chizkiyahu]; he was successful wherever he turned; he rebelled against the king of Assyria and would not serve him.” Notice that the rebellion is presented separately from the description of Chizkiyahus’s wise and successful actions. This indicates that the rebellion was neither wise nor successful.",
                "<i><b>The Alliance with Babylon</b></i>",
                "Chizkiyahu HaMelech falls into a long-standing dysfunctional pattern in Sefer Melachim. Asa bribes Aram to save him from the Ba’asha Melech Yisrael, and Aram remains a prolonged nuisance until the days of Achaz. Achaz then bribes the Assyrians to rid Yehudah of Aram, in turn bringing the Assyrian menace to Yehudah.",
                "Almost inexplicably, Chizkiyahu HaMelech allies with Bavel (Melachim II 20) to rid Eretz Yisrael of the Assyrians. Bavel later grabs control of Eretz Yisrael and destroys the Beit HaMikdash. Why does Chizkiyahu repeat the terrible errors of Asa and Achaz?",

                "Once again, Chizkiyahu, instead of adopting Yeshayahu HaNavi’s “<i>Hishameir VeHashkeit</i>” approach (see Yeshayahu 7), seeks to resist Assyria by allying with Bavel. One would think that the devastation wrought by Sancheirev’s invasion of Yehudah teaches Chizkiyahu a lesson. Unfortunately, Chizkiyahu acts in an overambitious manner, to the long-term detriment of the Bnei Yisrael.",
                "<i><b>R. Yochanan ben Zakkai Learns the Lesson</b></i>",
                "Fortunately, R. Yochanan ben Zakkai learned from these mistakes and internalized Yeshayahu HaNavi’s message of “<i>Mei Shilo’ach HoHolechim Le’at</i>,” “the waters of Shilo’ach (Jerusalem’s river) run slowly” (Yeshayahu 8:6). The Bnei Yisrael are an eternal people, attached to the eternal Torah. Eternal people should play the long game, and act with prudence and moderation.",
                "It is for this reason that R. Yochanan ben Zakkai makes modest requests (Hatzalah Purta) from Vespasian, instead of making the bold request to spare Yerushalayim and the Beit HaMikdash (Gittin 56). It is not for naught that the Gemara (Berachot 28b with Rashi) relates that Chizkiyahu HaMelech’s Neshamah (spirit, soul) comes to escort the Neshamah of R. Yochanan ben Zakkai to Gan Eden. Chizkiyahu HaMelech serves as a potent response to the critics of R. Yochanan ben Zakkai, who claimed that he was too cautious with Vespasian.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">296</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chizkiyahu HaMelech, as noted by TABC student Daniel Rothstein (‘20), also may serve as a basis for why R. Yochanan ben Zakkai remained silent when Vespasian challenged him with the claim “if a serpent lurks on a barrel of honey, does not one break the barrel when eliminating the serpent?” Critics such as R. Akiva claimed R. Yochanan ben Zakkai should have responded: “one should take tongs, remove the serpent, and leave the barrel of honey intact.” R. Yochanan ben Zakkai could have responded by invoking the precedent of Chikiyahu HaMelech’s insistence that no one respond to Ravshakeh’s toxic messages (Melachim II 18). Sometimes responding even an effective response to a person in power inflames the situation. In the extremely delicate negotiation with Vespasian, R. Yochanan ben Zakkai used the Chizkiyahu precedent to exercise great caution and diplomacy. R. Yochanan ben Zakkai’s goal was not to win the argument. He may he felt it worth allowing Vespasian to feel he won that verbal bout. Instead, R. Yochanan ben Zakkai focused on his goal of achieving Hatzala Purta, a moderate victory, which ultimately ensured the survival of Am Yisrael and Torat Yisrael. </i>",

                "Why then do we celebrate the Chashmona’im for their bold stand against the Syrian-Greeks? They seemingly acted similar to Chizkiyahu and Bar Kochva in their taking on the world’s superpower of the time.",
                "The answer is that Hashem guarantees that the Torah and the Jewish people will last forever (VaYikra 26:44-45, et al.). The Syrian-Greeks sought to eliminate Torah, and thus the Chashmona’im were divinely assured of victory in their quest to preserve it. This was a most necessary and unavoidable war. By contrast, Torah life was able to function under Assyrian domination and later Roman domination (albeit with considerable difficulty).

After all, so many people and kings lived in the days before the repeal of the Avodah Zarah inclination, and no one is described as having acted as poorly as did Menashe.

Ashi that “had you lived in my era you would have acted worse.” Menashe means that the threat of the Assyrians bore great pressure on the Melech, and his evaluation of the prior two royal reigns’ policies led him to a conclusion to which even R.

When they were engaged in the matters to which they were accustomed, a euphemism for intercourse, she passed wind and said: Just as this passed wind will not return to its place, so too Elazar ben Dordaya will not be accepted in repentance, even if he were to try to repent.</i>",
                "<i>This statement deeply shocked Elazar ben Dordaya, and he went and sat between two mountains and hills and said: Mountains and hills, pray for mercy on my behalf, so that my repentance will be accepted. They said to him: Before we pray for mercy on your behalf, we must pray for mercy on our own behalf, as it is stated: “For the mountains may depart, and the hills be removed” (Yeshayahu 54:10). He said: Heaven and earth, pray for mercy on my behalf. They said to him: Before we pray for mercy on your behalf, we must pray for mercy on our own behalf, as it is stated: “For the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment” (Yeshayahu 51:6). He said: Sun and moon, pray for mercy on my behalf.

He said: Stars and constellations, pray for mercy on my behalf.

The Gemara answers: There too, since he was attached so strongly to the sin, to an extent that transcended the physical temptation he felt, it is similar to heresy, as it had become like a form of idol worship for him.</i>",

Similarly, Sefer Melachim implies that Menashe does not miss any opportunity to engage in Avodah Zarah. Melachim II 21:3 states that Menashe “bowed down to the entire host of the heaven and worshipped them.” This may be understood in a literal sense.",
                "Menashe and Elazar both sin with the direct intent of violating the sacred word of Hashem. Elazar ben Dordaya succumbs to the greatest Yetzer HaRa (evil inclination) that remained in full force even after the Anshei Kenesset HaGedolah convinced Hashem to remove the Yetzer HaRa for Avodah Zarah (Sanhedrin 64a).",
                "Menashe and Rabi Elazar ben Dordaya both engage in Teshuvah. In both cases, the Teshuvah is prompted by an encounter with a foreigner far from Eretz Yisrael. But the comparison ends here. Rabi Elazar ben Dordaya’s Teshuvah is embraced and accepted; his acceptance to Olam HaBa is uncontested. Menashe’s Teshuvah, by contrast, is subject to a major debate and ambivalence to this very day, as we discussed in the previous chapter. Why is Rabi Elazar ben Dordaya’s Teshuvah treated differently than Menashe’s Teshuvah?",
                "One could say that Rabi Elazar ben Dordaya does complete Teshuvah, while Menashe fails to fully repent. (As Divrei HaYamim II 34 records, Menashe does not remove the Bamot after he reinstates them at the beginning of his reign.) While other reasonably righteous Judean kings also do not remove the Bamot, it is Menashe’s responsibility to remove them since he is the one who reinstated them after his father Chizkiyahu HaMelech removed them.",
                "The primary distinction between Rabi Elazar ben Dordaya and Menashe is that Menashe is a Chotei UMachati, a sinner who causes many others to sin. Menashe persecutes those who oppose his rampant idolatry. Even after he repents, the evil he does is not, and cannot, be undone. There is no evidence, on the other hand, that Rabi Elazar ben Dordaya causes others to sin.",
                "Perhaps this is the deeper meaning of the Malbim’s teaching that Menashe repents only from the sin of Avodah Zarah, but not from murder. The impact of his Avodah Zarah is reversible; however, Menashe’s many acts of murder cannot be undone.",

One can always do Teshuvah for a personal offense, as is evident from the dramatic story of Rabi Elazar ben Dordaya. The Gemara gives him the title of “Rabi” because his wholehearted Teshuvah serves as an inspiration. The same cannot be said about the Chotei UMachati’s personal Teshuvah.",
                "A Chotei UMachati who begins the Teshuvah process should zealously reach out to those whom they have negatively impacted, in an attempt to restore their spirituality. Menashe fails to do so, and consequently, a great debate rages as to his admissibility into Olam HaBa.",

                "The message that emerges from our contrast between Menashe and Rabi Elazar ben Dordaya is sobering. At all costs, one must not cause others to sin. It is much more difficult to inspire Torah observance than it is to encourage the abandonment of the Torah. It is a red line that we never dare to cross, for once we cross it, it is unlikely that we will ever find our way back."

Why do the individuals who discover this Sefer Torah react to their discovery with such consternation? This puzzling reaction amplifies the intrigue, and it seems that Yirmiyahu HaNavi deliberately obscures the full story.",

Divrei HaYamim II 33:14 states that “<i>Matza Chilkiyahu HaKohein Et Seifer Torat Hashem BeYad Moshe</i>,” “Chilkiyah the Kohen found the book of the Torah of Hashem in the hand of Moshe.” The Abarbanel, Metzudat David, Malbim, and Da’at Mikra all explain that the Sefer Torah that was discovered was the original Sefer Torah that Moshe Rabbeinu commissioned at the end of his life (Devarim 31:25-26) that was stored on the side of the Aron.",
                "Rashi (Melachim II 22:8) adds that the Sefer was hidden during the reign of the wicked Achaz, out of the concern that he would damage it. Radak (ibid.) insists that the Torah was actually concealed during the reign of Menashe. The Kohanim knew that this special Sefer Torah was hidden, but did not know its location. Thus, it was a great event to recover this lost unique and priceless Sefer Torah, especially during the reign of the righteous Yoshiyahu.",

In addition, the top of the column was Devarim 28:36, which states that “Hashem will exile you and your king.” This was viewed as a strikingly bad omen, especially since this special Sefer Torah was customarily rolled to BeReishit (Yerushalmi Shekalim 6, p. 49). According to this explanation, Yoshiyahu HaMelech’s reaction to the find makes perfect sense. It certainly is a most unsettling discovery!",

Yirmiyahu is characterized as the Navi of the Churban and is deeply affected by the events that lead up to it. The omen of the discovery of Moshe Rabbeinu’s special Sefer rolled to the portion discussing exile from the land, is so painful, that Yirmiyahu HaNavi obfuscates its presentation in Sefer Melachim.",
                "Sefer Devarim consists of Moshe’s farewell address to the Bnei Yisrael. He presents the Tochachah as a warning to the nation on the occasion of their upcoming entry into the land of Israel. Thus, it emerges that through his Sefer Torah, years after his death, Moshe once again warns the nation of potential exile if they will not heed Hashem’s word. Time and time again, the nation fails to heed this warning. Time is running out when the Sefer Torah is discovered during Yoshiyahu’s reign. The Bnei Yisrael are given many chances to do Teshuvah, and time and time again, they are warned that their sovereignty over the land depends on their observance of the Torah. Much of Sefer Yirmiyahu is centered around this idea, and Yirmiyahu HaNavi spends much of his life disseminating it. Given this long history of unheeded warnings, dating all the way back to that of Moshe Rabbeinu, Yirmiyahu HaNavi may find the discovery of Moshe Rabbeinu’s warning so painful, that he decides to omit these details from Sefer Melachim.",
                "In contrast, as we have discussed elsewhere, Ezra HaSofer, the author of the often much more optimistic Divrei HaYamim, is tasked with the spiritual rejuvenation of the Bnei Yisrael after their experience in Galut Bavel. He, therefore, presents a more complete picture of the Sefer Torah’s discovery. The fact that the Sefer Torah was written by Moshe Rabbeinu further accomplishes Ezra’s mission. He can better connect the Jews of the Bayit Sheini period to the greatest Navi of all time and the first link in the chain of the Mesorah, Moshe Rabbeinu.",

The consensus of the traditional commentaries and the clarification offered by Divrei HaYamim together yield a most satisfying approach that does not employ the use of agenda-driven explanations that are divorced from the world of traditional Tanach commentary."

We hear of Chuldah only in this instance in Tanach, and thus seems to be a far less prominent Navi than Yirmiyahu.

Chuldah stands nearly alone in trying to rebuke the women of the generation (as noted by the Gemara cited by our Radak) to leave their evil ways and return to Hashem.

Rachav, as taught by the Gemara (Megillah 14b), converted to Judaism and married none other than Yehoshua bin Nun. Indeed, Rachav is presented in Sefer Yehoshua as recognizing Hashem as the only true God (Yehoshua 2:11).

In a variation of this theme, perhaps Chuldah, as a descendant of Rachav and Yehoshua, represents the Bnei Yisrael’s conquest and possession of Eretz Yisrael. Perhaps Yoshiyahu and his advisors believe that Chuldah will maintain that which her ancestors represent, and relate the seemingly fitting prophecy that the Jews will remain in Eretz Yisrael, and be spared the punishment of exile.",

Perhaps Chuldah feels that it is necessary to speak this way because the kingdom of Yehudah is not destined to last very long. The Gemara (Megillah 14b) quotes R. Nachman as being critical of this Chutzpah. Rachav practiced as a woman of ill repute and managed an inn in the corrupt city of Yericho.

Most see a story of how Yoshiyahu HaMelech, as part of his massive Teshuvah movement, organizes a magnificent celebration of Pesach and Korban Pesach (Melachim II 23). As the story involves the celebration of Pesach, we read it on Pesach. However, if one delves more deeply, one can perceive a far more profound lesson communicated by Chazal in their selection (Megillah 31a) of this section of the Tanach as the Haftarah for the second day of Pesach.",

He removes all articles associated with Ba’al and Asheirah from the Beit HaMikdash, defiles the various Avodah Zarah altars found throughout Eretz Yisrael, and, amongst other actions, kills the idolatrous priests. But why does he organize a massive Pesach celebration? How does that help him in his efforts to rid the land of idol worship? The answer seems fairly obvious, based on the focus of the original Korban Pesach in Mitzrayim. Slaughtering a lamb, an Egyptian god, is an expression of our rejection of the Egyptian deity. Yoshiyahu HaMelech taps into this message and organizes a massive Korban Pesach observance to reenact the original national rejection of Avodah Zarah.",
                "Thus, the Haftarah teaches us that in every generation we can tap into the idea of the Korban Pesach as a rejection of Avodah Zarah, or any ideology or belief system that is antithetical and incompatible with the Torah. Yoshiyahu’s Teshuvah from foreign ideology, so encapsulated by his great Korban Pesach observance, serves as a model for all Jews to use Pesach as an opportunity to reaffirm our complete and uncompromised commitment to Torah practice and Torah ideology.",

After the death of the last powerful Assyrian emperor Ashurbanipal in 627 BCE, the Assyrian empire began to crumble. As far as Eretz Yisrael is concerned, this meant the freeing of northern Israel from Assyrian control. Yoshiyahu HaMelech, as is clear from our Perek, steps in and retakes control of northern Israel, as Rashi notes to Melachim II 23:22.

The Korban Pesach of Yoshiyahu similarly celebrates the reunification of the southern Bnei Yisrael with the remnants of Bnei Yisrael in the north.

Rashi explains that “the days of the Shofetim” refers to the time since Malchut Yehudah and Malchut Yisrael split into two. Thus, “the days of the Shofetim” does not refer specifically to the era of the Shofetim, but even to the time of Shlomo HaMelech.",
                "According to our approach, we suggest that in the period following the Shofetim, up until Yoshiyahu’s Pesach celebration, the Korban Pesach neither symbolizes a rejection of Avodah Zarah nor serves to reunify Am Yisrael. During the cycles of spiritual deterioration and disunity in Sefer Shofetim, it is most appropriate for the Korban Pesach to act as an affirmation of our rejection of Avodah Zarah and an expression of the unification of our people. During Shlomo HaMelech’s reign, the Korban Pesach does not have to fill that role— the kingdom is unified and the national identity is well-established. After the kingdom is split, and Avodah Zarah becomes rampant throughout the land, the Korban Pesach clearly does not reflect a sense of unity or rejection of Avodah Zarah. Thus, Yoshiyahu HaMelech’s Korban Pesach, for the first time since the period of the Shofetim, both rejects Avodah Zarah and serves to unify the nation.",

The latter reminds us of the Korban Pesach the Bnei Yisrael offer when they enter Eretz Yisrael under Yehoshua’s leadership. This “Eretz Yisrael-worthy” generation is untainted by the sin of Avodah Zarah. Thus, their Korban Pesach is an expression of national solidification, and not of rejection of Avodah Zarah.",
                "Indeed, the Gemara (Sanhedrin 43b-44a) stresses how our national identity and responsibility for one another was enhanced by our entry into Eretz Yisrael. Thus, upon our entry into the land, the Korban Pesach takes on a special significance. It is no coincidence that the Bnei Yisrael enter the land just in time to offer the Korban Pesach. It is also not a coincidence that this Haftarah is the Haftarah for the first day of Pesach, which is also read in Eretz Yisrael. The message of Yoshiyahu’s Korban Pesach, by contrast, is more relevant for Jews who unfortunately reside outside of Eretz Yisrael, and is thus reserved for the second day of Pesach.",

May Hashem grant us all the wisdom to properly focus on the Haftarot, and to glean the vital lessons imparted during these precious readings."

                "Some events in Sefer Melachim are just too painful to fully record. There are at least two tragic pivotal turning points in Sefer Melachim that strike a terrible blow to the Jewish people and play a major role in setting the stage for the Churban. It appears that Yirmiyahu HaNavi, the author of Sefer Melachim, has difficulty in fully expressing these extremely painful realities.",

                "Thirteen years after he begins his Teshuvah movement, Yoshiyahu HaMelech is killed at the age of thirty-nine by Paroh Necho’s Egyptian army. This traumatic episode is described in one cryptic verse<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">309</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“In his days Paroh Necho, king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates; and king Yoshiyahu went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.”</i> (Melachim II 23:29). It is almost as if the Navi does not want to record this event, and therefore presents the story in the shortest and most obscure manner possible.",
                "Yoshiyahu HaMelech, entirely unnecessarily, enters into battle with Paroh Necho. Paroh Necho, according to the account in Divrei HaYamim II 35:21, even communicates to Yoshiyahu HaMelech that he is merely using Eretz Yisrael as a route to fight the Babylonians at the Battle of Carchemish. According to Chazal (Ta’anit 22b), Yirmiyahu Hanavi warns Yoshiyahu HaMelech against intervening.",
                "Against all advice, Yoshiyau enters into battle with Paroh Necho at Megiddo. During the battle, Yoshiyahu HaMelech is caught by an errant arrow and dies shortly afterward.",
                "The results for the Jews are devastating. Yoshiyahu’s Teshuvah movement comes to a screeching halt before it can gain serious momentum and support. The righteous Yoshiyahu HaMelech’s death at a young age also serves to demotivate many who seek to serve Hashem with devotion and dedication. After his death, political control over Eretz Yisrael falls to the Egyptians and then to the Babylonians. Yoshiyahu’s death is a painful blow, from which we have yet to fully recover.",
                "Therefore, we suggest that Yirmiyahu HaNavi writes about Yoshiyahu HaMelech’s unnecessary and tragic death most cryptically. Only with the help of the parallel narrative in Divrei HaYamim and the teachings of Chazal are we able to decipher what occured on that terrible day at Megiddo. Yirmiyahu laments, if only Yoshiyahu had made a better choice that day, Jewish history would have turned out very differently.",

Rashi states that Yarav’am publicly criticizes Shlomo HaMelech, which the latter finds intolerable. Had only Yarav’am taken the wise path, and privately spoken to Shlomo HaMelech, perhaps Shlomo HaMelech would have changed his ways. This, in turn, could have avoided the terrible secession of northern Israel from southern Israel, which contributed mightily to the downfall of all of Israel.",

He is prematurely killed at age thirty-nine in a losing battle against the Egyptian forces in Megiddo (Melachim II 23:29). Chuldah is regarded as a legitimate prophetess (Megillah 14a). Why does her promise not materialize?",
                "<i><b>Classic Answers</b></i>",
                "Rashi and Radak explain that Yoshiyahu HaMelech dies in peace since he does not see the Churban during his lifetime. The Malbim (Melachim II 23:29) takes this idea even further and argues that Hashem brings about Yoshiyahu’s premature death at Megiddo so that he will not witness the Churban.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">312</sup><i class=\"footnote\">TABC alumnus Jonathan Haberman (‘19) notes that this is reminiscent of Chazal’s teaching that Avraham Avinu died five years before his intended time so that he would not witness Eisav’s spiritual decline. </i> The Metzudat David and Malbim (Melachim II 22:20) explain (following, as usual, the Abarbanel) that Yoshiyahu HaMelech is “buried in peace.” Indeed, he is the last of the Malchei Yehudah who are buried in Eretz Yisrael.",

                "However, there is a much simpler approach to take. Namely, one’s unwise choices and/or sins can lead to the withdrawal of even positive divine promises. Indeed, Tosafot (Yevamot 50a) state that a Navi prophesies only that which is suitable to happen at the time of the Nevu’ah’s pronouncement. However, if one sins, the promise can be reversed.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">313</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Da’at Mikra frequently refers to this Tosafot to resolve many apparent issues in Tanach. </i>",
                "Tosafot present a very compelling proof for this seemingly radical assertion. Tosafot note that Yoshiyahu’s destruction of the Bamah in Beit El is prophesied centuries before his birth (Melachim I 13), during the reign of Yarav’am. Yet, were it not for Chizkiyahu’s intense Tefillah, Chizkiyahu would not have been granted fifteen more years of life during which he fathered Menashe, Yoshiyahu’s grandfather.",
                "Ramban (Shemot 12:40) supports this thesis as well. Ramban argues that the Bnei Yisrael were supposed to leave Mitzrayim four hundred years after Yitzchak Avinu’s birth. However, he explains that thirty years were added as a result of the nation’s sins. Thus, we see that even a positive divine promise may be rescinded.",
                "The Gemara (Berachot 4a) strongly supports this idea. The Gemara explains that Yaakov Avinu feared his encounter with Eisav despite Hashem’s promise he would return home in peace, due to concern that he forfeited his guarantee due to sin. Similarly, the Gemara states that we were destined to return to build Bayit Sheini in a glorious and miracle studded manner, similar to that which occurred to Yehoshua when he led us into Eretz Yisrael. However, due to our sins, the Second Temple era return fell dramatically short of what it was supposed to be.",
                "Likewise, due to his decision to enter into battle with Egypt, Yoshiyahu no longer merits the promise of a peaceful death. Had it not been for this poor decision, Chuldah’s prophecy would have been fulfilled.",

However, there are a number of exceptions. One such exception is at the beginning of a Navi’s career when he is being tested as to whether he truly is capable of authentic prophecy. At this stage, the positive prophecies must materialize, or he is presumed to be a Navi Sheker.",
                "Rambam only writes that positive prophecies always materialize in the context of a Navi proving his prophetic ability. We suggest that Rambam applies this principle only to a Navi who must still establish his authenticity. Thus, since Chuldah is a well-established prophetess, her positive Nevu’ot have the potential to be reversed through bad decisions.",
                "Another exception is when a Navi’s authenticity faces a credible challenge. This applies to the Chananiah ben Azor situation, when Yirmiyahu challenges him to establish his credibility.",
                "In addition, in regard to both positive and negative prohibitions, the Malbim states in several places (including to Melachim I 11:30) that a Nevu’ah accompanied by a sign cannot be rescinded. The Nevu’ah Achiyah HaShiloni expresses to Yarav’am ben Nevat is such an example, as the Nevu’ah is accompanied by the tearing of clothing.",
                "Finally, a positive or negative Nevu’ah in which Hashem is quoted as taking an oath (such “<i>Chai Ani Ne’um Hashem</i>”) cannot be rescinded.",

                "Nevu’ah does not call for an abdication of responsibility. Yoshiyahu HaMelech, we suggest, might not fully grasp this point. In fact, in his calculations as to whether to engage the Egyptians in battle, he may believe that he has a guarantee of at least a successful personal outcome, due to Chuldah’s promise that he will die a peaceful death.",
                "The lesson that emerges is a sobering one. Hashem may have magnificent plans in store for our lives. However, if we do not act to realize our latent potential, or worse, act foolishly, all of it might be lost in an instant. The Mishnah teaches that “<i>HaKol Tzafui VeHaReshut Netunah</i>,” “all is foreseen but free will remains” (Avot 3:15).

In this chapter, we will seek to explain why the death of Yoshiyahu is so traumatic, to the extent that it is worthy of inclusion in the Tishah Be’Av liturgy, along with the mourning of other major disasters, such as the Churban Beit HaMikdash and the Crusades.",

Yoshiyahu stands out as an individual whose actions are foretold approximately three hundred years before his birth. In Melachim I 13:1-2, we read of an anonymous prophet (whom Chazal identify as Iddo, see Sanhedrin 89b) who visits the wicked Yarav’am ben Nevat, after the latter constructs illegitimate altars in Beit El and Dan. The Navi informs the wicked king that a descendant of David HaMelech, named Yoshiyahu, will one day be born, and will kill many priests who will serve on Yarav’am’s illicit altars.",
                "It is quite rare for an event to be foretold so far in advance— it is almost without parallel in Tanach. No other king’s actions and name are so specifically given so far in advance, which testifies to Yoshiyahu HaMelech’s unique stature. Interestingly, though, Yoshiyahu is unaware of this prophecy (see Melachim II 23:17). This expresses Chazal’s dictum, that “everything is foretold, yet the freedom of choice is given” (Avot 3:19), a theme that pervades Yoshiyahu’s life.",

Only Asa (5), Chizkiyahu (14) and Yoshiyahu (17) are labeled as good as David HaMelech, and Asa is assessed less positively in Divrei HaYamim than he is in Sefer Melachim. Of all the other kings, Shlomo (2), Yehoshafat (6), and Yotam (12) are good, though they do not measure up to David; Yeho’ash (9), Amatzyah (10), and Uzziyahu (11) start their reigns as good kings, but take a turn for the worse (at least as presented in Divrei HaYamim); and Rechav’am (3), Aviyam (4), Yehoram (7), Achazyahu (8), Achaz (13), Menashe (15), and Amon (16) are all bad kings.

This highlights the greatness of those kings who chose to lead our nation in accordance with Torah ideals. We should also note that Yoshiyahu’s four successors are all evaluated by Sefer Melachim as spiritual (as well as political) failures. Thus, of the last seven rulers of Judea, only Yoshiyahu is regarded as a Tzaddik. This stresses his outstanding nature.",

                "We must make note of Yoshiyahu’s grandfather, Menashe. Despite being the son of the righteous Chizkiyahu, Menashe engages in wickedness in the extreme. He is regarded as the worst of the monarchs described in Sefer Melachim. No other king, even among the evil rulers of the Northern Kingdom (such as Ba’asha), is described in such negative terms. He is described (Melachim II 21:2-11) as having done evil in the eyes of Hashem, having imitated the evil practices of the other nations, having exceeded the evil of the Emori, and having sinned with the brazen intention of angering Hashem.",
                "The Navi presents a stunning list of idolatrous practices in which Menashe engages throughout his lifetime: Molech, Ov, Yidoni, Baal, Asheirah, Onein, and Nichush. He even places an idol in the Beit HaMikdash. To top it off, Menashe is described as murdering so many innocent people, that he fills the streets of Yerushalayim with blood from “mouth to mouth.” It is reasonable to assume that he executes these people for their resistance towards his plans to fill Yehudah with idolatry. To make matters worse, Menashe rules for fifty-five years, the longest of any monarch in Sefer Melachim, allowing his lust for idolatry to seep into the hearts and minds of Am Yisrael.

Even though he is obviously unfit to rule at that age, he is installed as the king because he is next in the Davidic line. The people of Judea, despite their spiritual shortcomings, zealously honor the Davidic line even after they assassinate a disliked king.",

Divrei HaYamim 34 describes that he begins to take an interest in the proper Torah way at age sixteen, and initiates the process of purifying the Beit HaMikdash at age twenty. Incidentally, this shows that the teenage years are a time that is ripe for individuals to return to their Jewish roots.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">316</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Many have noted that Yoshiyahu HaMelech’s Teshuvah coincides with the death of the last mighty Assyrian emperor Ashurbanipal in 627 BCE, and the subsequent crumbling of the Assyrian Empire. The removal of this pressure creates an opportunity to return to the Torah without fear of harassment from the Assyrian authorities. This fact does not detract from the greatness of Yoshiyahu’s choice to return to the Torah. An analogous situation emerged in the late 1980s with the fall of the Soviet Union. Russian Jews were no longer under terrible government pressure to abandon Torah and Mitzvot. However, even when the pressure eased, the terrible toll of seventy years of communist rule persisted, and most Russian Jews did not return to their Torah roots. Those Russian Jews who did return, though, and there are a considerable number of them, deserve an enormous amount of credit. Yoshiyahu’s HaMelech’s Teshuvah, after the long dark decades of Menashe and Amon’s decadent rule and the lifting of the Assyrian siege on Judaism, similarly merits our great admiration. </i> Interestingly, R.

Imagine further that America had not enjoyed a stable succession of leaders even before 1900 who were dedicated to the ideals of democracy. The challenge of effecting such a change would require a Herculean effort, and it probably would take two or three generations for the American people to internalize the need to return to the roots upon which the country was founded. Yoshiyahu faces similar formidable odds in his attempt to restore the ideals of David HaMelech’s rule.",

As explained by the Midrash HaGadol (Devarim 27) and Radak (Melachim II 22:11), Yoshiyahu correctly interprets this as a bad omen and seeks the interpretation of a Navi.",

He gathers all of Am Yisrael and its leaders and demands that the nation make a solemn commitment (Brit) to dedicate itself wholeheartedly to the service of Hashem. He commits himself to the complete elimination of Avodah Zarah from Eretz Yisrael. The Navi records that Yoshiyahu eliminates his grandfather Menashe’s Avodah Zarah, as well as the misdirected places of worship (Bamot) put in place by Yarav’am and Shlomo HaMelech. None of Yoshiyahu’s righteous predecessors, other than Chizkiyahu, remove the Bamot.",

Although Chizkiyahu is a righteous king, when Yeshayahu relates the eventual destruction of the Beit HaMikdash to him, Chizkiyahu responds that “at least there will be peace in my day” (Melachim 2:20:19). Yoshiyahu’s contrastingly selfless reaction again marks him as an unparalleled Tzaddik among the descendants of David HaMelech. Indeed, Rabbi Hayyim Angel notes that Yoshiyahu is the only individual in Tanach who is described (Melachim II 23:25) as having fulfilled the Torah’s mandate to worship Hashem “with all of your heart, soul, and resources” (Devarim 6:5), which also serves to emphasize the greatness of this amazing king. Indeed, R. Elazar HaKalir even goes as far as to compare Yoshiyahu’s righteousness to that of Moshe Rabbeinu!",
                "We must ask, however, why Yoshiyahu even bothers to attempt to undo the decree. After all, the word of the prophetess represents God’s immutable will. How can this possibly change? The answer appears to be (following the approach advocated by the Abarbanel) that an evil decree that can be reversed with Teshuvah. We see that after the Cheit HaEigel, Moshe Rabbeinu, through Teshuvah and Tefillah, is able to reverse Hashem’s decree of national destruction.",
                "Ashkenazi Jews express this idea on Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur when they state that “Teshuvah, Tefillah, and Tzedakah can remove the evil of the decree.” Indeed, on Yom Kippur, we read in Sefer Yonah about how the Teshuvah of the people of Nineveh is able to overturn the decree of the city’s destruction. Yoshiyahu HaMelech follows in Moshe Rabbeinu’s footsteps in trying to rid the Bnei Yisrael of idolatrous practices and leads them back to a path where they will be able to experience Hashem’s presence.",

                "Rav Yoel Bin Nun notes that an archaeological discovery seems to corroborate Yirmiyahu’s evaluation. A shard of pottery dated to Yoshiyahu’s time describes a soldier who called to the attention of the authorities what he deemed to be unfair treatment— his commanding officer destroyed his clothing. Only in a society where justice prevails would a soldier be able to register such a complaint against his commanding officer without the fear of any consequences.",
                "Divrei HaYamim describes Yoshiyahu as impacting all of Eretz Yisrael, not merely Judea (Divrei HaYamim II 34:6-7 and 34:21). This appears astonishing in light of the fact that Yoshiyahu is a Judean king– what is he doing in the north? The answer lies in the historical context of Yoshiyahu’s reign (see Da’at Mikra Divrei HaYamim, p. 933). During that time, the Assyrian Empire that had controlled the northern portion of Eretz Yisrael from the time of Chizkiyahu was collapsing. Yoshiyahu appears to have seized the opportunity to expand the borders of his kingdom to include the former Northern Kingdom.",
                "Sefer Melachim II 23:24, however, indicates the limitations of Yoshiyahu’s Teshuvah campaign. It records that Yoshiyahu succeeds in eliminating the idolatry that “appeared” in Judea. This clearly implies that the nation’s private Avodah Zarah remains. Two Pesukim later, we are told that there was never a king who so sincerely returned to Hashem, either before or after Yoshiyahu. This also seems to imply that only Yoshiyahu had returned and that the people had not wholeheartedly joined him in his efforts.",
                "Indeed, Chazal (Taanit 22b; see R. Elazar HaKalir’s Kinah mourning Yoshiyahu) explain that during Yoshiyahu’s time, many Jews covertly worshipped Avodah Zarah. They describe how people hid Avodah Zarah behind their doors to escape its detection by soldiers enforcing Yoshiyahu’s law.",
                "It seems that the soldiers are not particularly thorough in their searches, as they seem to carry out royal decrees perfunctorily and without much enthusiasm. This also explains how the Bnei Yisrael deserved the Churban not so long after Yoshiyahu’s death. Yoshiyahu’s reformations seem to have little impact on the people’s hearts. They merely cooperate in the removal of public idolatry. Finally, this also explains why Yirmiyahu castigates Am Yisrael even during Yoshiyahu’s period of reformation (see Yirmiyahu 3:6-10 and 25:3).",
                "<i><b>The Traumatic Death of Yoshiyahu</b></i>",
                "Thirteen years after the introduction of his reformation movement, Yoshiyahu is killed at the age of thirty-nine by Paroh Necho’s Egyptian army. This episode is so traumatic that Sefer Melachim describes this tragedy in one cryptic Pasuk (Melachim II 23:29). It is almost as if the Navi does not want to record this event, and therefore presents the story in the shortest and most obscure manner possible.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">317</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the earlier chapter, “Too Painful to Record — Yoshiyahu HaMelech’s Death.” </i> The Navi records that, “In his days, Paroh Necho, king of Egypt, marched against the king of Assyria to the Euphrates River; Yoshiyahu HaMelech marched toward him, but when he confronted him at Megiddo, [Paroh Neco] killed him.” The Pasuk does not explain why Paroh travels to the Assyrian King, why Yoshiyahu travels towards Paroh Necho, or why Paroh Necho kills Yoshiyahu.",
                "Divrei HaYamim II 35:20-23 provides us with a few more details, but is also sparing in its presentation of this tragedy. It informs us that Paroh travels to join the King of Assyria at Carchemish on the Euphrates. This well-known battle, also documented by non-Jewish sources, occurred in 609 B.C.E (see also Yirmiyahu 46). The battle pitted the crumbling Assyrian Empire against the emerging Babylonian Empire. It seems that Paroh Necho joined the Assyrian forces in an attempt to prevent the Babylonian takeover of the region and to further Egyptian interests to expand their empire into the areas lost by the Assyrians.",
                "Divrei HaYamim records that Paroh Necho sends Yoshiyahu a non-confrontational message. He does not intend to engage Yoshiyahu in battle. He wishes to merely travel through Eretz Yisrael along the international trade route that cuts through the Jezreel Valley, where Megiddo is located. Yoshiyahu ignores the warnings and confronts the Egyptian forces. Yoshiyahu disguises himself in battle but nevertheless is shot down by the Egyptian arrows. It is of note that an arch-villain of Sefer Melachim, Achav, dies under eerily similar circumstances (see Melachim I 22:30-34 and Midrash VaYikra Rabbah 20:1).",
                "<i><b>Assessing the Extent of the Tragedy</b></i>",
                "Yoshiyahu’s death is a multidimensional tragedy. It seems that Yoshiyahu is motivated to wage war to prevent Paroh Necho from expanding his sphere of influence in the Middle East and thereby impinging on the former’s control of northern Israel. Unfortunately, Sefer Melachim records that following Yoshiyahu’s death, the Egyptians seize control of Eretz Yisrael, and the subsequent Judean “kings” merely serve as Egyptian vassals. The Babylonians then overtake the Egyptians (Melachim II 24:7) and gain control over Eretz Yisrael. Thus, the death of Yoshiyahu effectively marks the end of Jewish sovereign control of Eretz Yisrael, which is not regained until centuries later, in the days of the Chashmonaim.",
                "Accordingly, Yoshiyahu’s death essentially marks the beginning of the Churban. In fact, there is a suggestion that Yirmiyahu’s prophecy of seventy years of exile (Yirmiyahu 25:11) refers in part to the seventy years from Yoshiyahu’s death until Koresh’s proclamation permitting the return to Yerushalayim to rebuild the Beit HaMikdash, which according to non-Jewish sources occurs in 539 B.C.E (exactly seventy years after the battle of Carchemish). For further discussion of the fulfillment of the seventy years, see Da’at Mikra to Divrei HaYamim II 36:21, note 56.",
                "However, the most profound aspect of this tragedy is the fact that such an incredibly righteous king could die in battle. To make matters worse, he dies in the same manner as did Achav! In fact, one could argue that it is for this very reason that the Bnei Yisrael ignore the impassioned pleas of Yirmiyahu and Yechezkeil to repent before the Churban. While Menashe serves every sort of Avodah Zarah and reigns peacefully for fifty-five years, Yoshiyahu, who destroys the Avodah Zarah, is killed prematurely in battle at age thirty-nine. People most likely felt that serving Hashem did not pay.",
                "Furthermore, had Yoshiyahu not died, his Teshuvah movement potentially could have remained in effect for a significant amount of time. In that amount of time, a new generation that did not know Menashe could have emerged and possibly been much more committed to Torah life than the previous generation. Such a Teshuvah movement likely could have averted the Churban. Alas, this was not to be.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">318</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik’s Reflections on the Tishah BeAv Kinot pp. 285-286 for a similar approach.</i>",
                "<i><b>Why Doesn’t Yoshiyahu Consult Yirmiyahu?</b></i>",
                "Why does Yoshiyahu not consult Yirmiyahu as to whether he should confront Paroh Necho? We suggest that Yoshiyahu does not consult with Yirmiyahu because he is afraid that he will receive an unfavorable answer. Yirmiyahu (see Yirmiyahu 2:18) follows in the footsteps of Yeshayahu (Yeshayahu 30:1-5) by disseminating a national policy of neutrality towards foreign superpowers (such as Assyria and Babylon). Instead of becoming entangled in foreign affairs, the Bnei Yisrael should be satisfied, as Yeshayahu metaphorically expresses, with “the waters of the Shilo’ach (a stream outside of Yerushalayim) that moves along slowly” (Yeshayahu 8:6). Despite his mistake of confronting the Egyptians, Chazal (Ta’anit ad. loc.) identify Yoshiyahu’s dying words as “<i>Tzaddik Hu Hashem, Ki Pihu Mariti</i>,” “Hashem is righteous, as I have rebelled against His word” (Eichah 1:18). Thus, Yoshiyahu performs Teshuvah at the end of his life.",
                "<i><b>Conclusion</b></i>",
                "Yoshiyahu’s death is an incredibly disappointing event in the history of our people, and it merits our attention today. We must also note, though, that we owe a great debt of gratitude to Yoshiyahu. Without his spiritual initiatives, the Bnei Yisrael would have had to endure living for more than a century under the rule of eight consecutive evil kings. Had that happened, Yehudah might have shared its fate with the ten northern tribes, who were ruled by evil kings for very long periods, and were consequently exiled. Therefore, we must acknowledge Yoshiyahu’s role in the continuity of our nation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">319</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For further explanation for the mourning of Yoshiyahu on Tishah Be’Av, see Rav Soloveitchik’s aforementioned work, pp. 275-286.</i>",
                "TABC alumnus Rav Avi Levinson adds that the righteous Jewish leaders in exile, such as Yechezkeil and Daniel, likely were impacted positively by Yoshiyahu’s Teshuvah movement. Without the thirteen years of Teshuvah, such great spiritual leaders would have been unlikely to emerge. Yoshiyahu must retain a significant place in the collective Jewish psyche since it was he who preserved the legacy of David HaMelech. Our spiritual survival, in the main, can be attributed to him.",
                "The discovery of Moshe Rabbeinu’s Sefer Torah and the Nevu’ah of Chuldah both directed Yoshiyahu to set out on his mission of spiritual renewal. The battle of Carchemish distracts him from this critical endeavor. This terribly misguided diversion cost Yoshiayhu HaMelech his life and completely derailed our nation’s process of religious return.",
                "The lesson for modern times is clear: We must remain focused on our goals and mission. Various fights and intrigues should never distract us from that which is truly important. Distraction can have devastating consequences, as it did for Yoshiyahu HaMelech and Am Yisrael, twenty years before the Churban."

                "<i><b>Introduction</b></i>",
                "Most Jews do not know why Tzom Gedaliah was instituted. Some are aware that we fast to mourn the death of Gedaliah ben Achikam, a Tzaddik. However, this is hardly a convincing reason to fast on an annual basis; after all, many Tzaddikim have died on a wide variety of days, and we do not fast for them. Many might respond that Gedaliah was a Tzaddik who was assassinated by another Jew. Sadly, this is also an inadequate response, as the Tanach is bloodied with many civil wars and assassinations. Sefer Shofetim, Sefer Shmuel, and Sefer Melachim each record tragic instances of internecine warfare, where many a Tzaddik was killed by the hand of a fellow Jew. What is so unique about Gedaliah’s death that merits the dedication of a fast day?",
                "<i><b>Yishmael ben Netaniah’s Motivation</b></i>",
                "To arrive at a satisfying explanation for Tzom Gedaliah, we must delve into the motivations of the assassin, as outlined in Melachim II 25:22-26, and paralleled in Yirmiyahu 41. The assassin, Yishmael ben Netaniah, is described as a member of the royal family. It is not difficult to discern why Yishmael ben Netaniah is deeply disturbed by Gedaliah ben Achikam’s actions.",
                "Gedaliah is appointed by the Nevuchadnetzar-led Babylonian Empire to govern the few Jews who were permitted to remain in Eretz Yisrael after the Churban Beit HaMikdash. He tells this remnant not to fear the servants of the Chaldeans, settle in the land, and serve the king of Babylonia, and he guarantees that “all will be well” with them (Melachim II 25:24 and Yirmiyahu 41:9). Yishmael ben Netaniah views Gedaliah ben Achikam as a traitor who disgracefully capitulates to the evil Nevuchadnetzar.",
                "Moreover, Gedaliah’s seat of government was in Mitzpah, a few miles north of Jerusalem. The Babylonians likely relocated the Jewish seat of leadership from Jerusalem to Mitzpah to demonstrate their continued control over the region, and that the days of Jewish sovereignty in Eretz Yisrael had ended. Yishmael ben Netaniah is utterly revolted by Gedaliah’s cooperation in this act of denigration directed towards Jerusalem and Jewish people.",
                "Gedaliah is also not part of the Davidic line. The Jews had preserved the passing of the leadership from son to son for twenty-two successive generations, all the way back to David HaMelech. Unlike the Northern Kingdom of Israel, which was under the rule of at least five different dynasties, the Southern Kingdom fervently preserved the Davidic line.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">320</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even after the assassinations of Yeho’ash, Amatziah, and Amon.</i> Yishmael ben Netaniah finds Gedaliah’s rise to power utterly intolerable and therefore decides to assassinate him.",
                "<i><b>Why Yishmael ben Netaniah was Wrong</b></i>",
                "After learning all of this background, one might readily be convinced that Yishmael was correct in his decision to assassinate Gedaliah! However, this obviously is not true. If Gedaliah truly disgraced our people by submitting to Babylonian rule, then we should not mourn his assassination by fasting. Indeed, Chazal (Rosh HaShanah 18b) refer to Gedaliah as a Tzaddik.",
                "Rather, Yishmael ben Netaniah was entirely incorrect. None other than Yirmiyahu HaNavi proclaimed (Yirmiyahu 25 and 29) seventy years of Babylonian rule over Eretz Yisrael due to the Bnei Yisrael’s sinful behavior. The Bnei Yisrael were supposed to submit to Babylonian rule. These seventy years would serve as an opportunity for the performance of the Teshuvah needed to merit the future Jewish sovereign control over Eretz Yisrael.",
                "Unfortunately, Yirmiyahu’s message was rejected by many, and he was even derided (see Yirmiyahu 7 and 26) as a false prophet. However, Yirmiyahu had repeatedly proven his authenticity, as his predictions of the failures of the Jewish rebellions against Nevuchadnetzar sadly materialized in full force. The Jewish rebellions ended in ruinous defeat with the exile of Yehoyachin in 597 B.C.E. This was followed by the exile of the Jewish leadership and prime vessels of the Beit HaMikdash, the destruction of the Beit HaMikdash, and exile of most of Judea in 586 B.C.E.",
                "By the time Gedaliah assumed the role of governor in 586 B.C.E., it was established beyond a reasonable doubt that Yirmiyahu was indeed communicating the authentic and accurate message of Hashem. Thus, while Yishmael ben Netaniah had noble intentions, his actions were in direct contradiction with the teachings of Yirmiyahu HaNavi. There was no reasonable excuse for Yishmael ben Netaniah’s actions. Although he might have had noble intentions, he is rightfully regarded as a Rasha, an evildoer.",
                "<i><b>The Fallout from Yishmael ben Netaniah’s Actions</b></i>",
                "The price we paid for Yishmael ben Netaniah’s evil murder of Gedaliah was steep indeed. In the short term, the remaining Jews felt compelled to leave Eretz Yisrael out of fear for the retributive wrath of Nebuchadnezzar and his forces. Chazal express the resulting utter desolation in Eretz Yisrael:",
                "<i>R. Yosi explained: for fifty-two years a bird was not seen flying in the land of Israel (Yerushalmi Ta'anit 4:5; end of Eichah Rabba Petichta).</i>",
                "However, there was a long term price to be paid as well. The Jews who returned to Eretz Yisrael after the termination of the seventy years of Babylonian rule returned to a desolate land. They had to rebuild the Jewish population from scratch. Moreover, the Jewish settlement of the Second Temple era never truly established a strong and long-lasting hold on Eretz Yisrael. This may be attributed to a great extent due to the fact that the first generation of returnees had to begin from scratch.",
                "If only Yishmael ben Netaniah and his band had heeded the words of Yirmiyahu HaNavi, spared the life of Gedaliah, and followed the latter’s prudent counsel. Jewish history may have turned out dramatically different. The Jews from Bavel would have returned to an Eretz Yisrael already blessed with a significant Jewish population and infrastructure.

                "Thus, the assassination of Gedaliah is most certainly worth commemorating with a fast day. It is most noteworthy that a well-meaning action led to such disastrous large scale consequences. We are reminded to heed the words of the “Yirmiyahus” of our time, the Torah leaders of our people. It is well worth fasting and internalizing this vital message with the hope that the mistake of the assassination not be repeated.",

The terrible sin of Gedaliah’s assassination led to terrible consequences. Our fasting on Tzom Gedaliah strongly supports this message, which is vital during the Aseret Yemei Teshuvah.",
                "Moreover, focusing on the assassination of Gedaliah and its terrible short and long-term consequences serves to communicate a major recurring theme in Sefer Melachim. The recurring message is that adherence to the words of Hashem communicated by the Navi brings prosperity, and ignoring the divine direction as relayed by a prophet leads only to disaster.",
                "Sefer Melachim and Sefer Yirmiyahu record how the last kings of Yehudah ignore Yirmiyahu’s repeated pleas to refrain from rebelling against Bavel, thereby setting our people on the path of exile, and causing the destruction of the Beit HaMikdash. Similarly, Yoshiyahu’s defiance of Yirmiyahu’s directive to refrain from confronting the Egyptian army on its way to assist the Assyrian army at the battle of Carchemish leads to his death. Another example is Achav’s fall (recorded in Melachim I 22) in the wake of his refusal to heed the instruction of the Navi Michah to refrain from entering a battle with Aram.",
                "By contrast, Rechav’am twice averts disaster by heeding the words of Shemayah the Navi to refrain from war. By doing so, Rechav’am avoids the terrible consequences of a disastrous civil war (see Melachim I 12) and complete destruction at the hands of the Egyptian Paroh Shishak (at the end of Melachim I 14). Similarly, the army of Yehoshafat fares well after it heeds the direction of the prophet Elisha (Melachim II 3).",
                "The utter destruction wrought by Yishmael ben Netaniah’s brazen disregard for the words of the Navi is a most poignant message during the time of Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur.

                "<i><b>Introduction</b></i>",
                "Most of us perceive the books of Yeshayahu and Yirmiyahu as essentially teaching the following message: You are terrible, so repent, or you will be destroyed. As we examine the choice of Yeshayahu as the prophet we read on Shabbat Chazon, the Shabbat preceding Tishah Be’Av, we shall see that there are great differences between these books that hardly can be described as delivering the same monochromatic message.",
                "<i><b>The Puzzling Choice of Yeshayahu</b></i>",
                "Chazal (cited in Tosafot Megillah 31b s.v. Rosh Chodesh Av) ordain that in the three weeks leading up to Tishah Be’Av, we read three Haftarot of distress (Gimmel DePuranuta), beginning with Yirmiyahu 1, followed by Yirmiyahu 2, and climaxing with Yeshayahu 1. The choice of Yirmiyahu is very obvious. Yirmiyahu is the prophet of the Churban. The first Haftarah presents Hashem’s mission statement to Yirmiyahu, which states that his primary mission is to communicate the message of the upcoming destruction of the Beit HaMikdash and Yerushalayim. Indeed, almost the entire book of Yirmiyahu is devoted to themes of destruction. Chazal (Bava Batra 14b) describe Sefer Yirmiyahu as “entirely about destruction.” Indeed, the Sefer describes at length Yirmiyahu’s experiences before, during, and after the Destruction.",
                "The choice of Yeshayahu as the concluding message of the Gimmel DePuranuta is shocking, to say the least. Yeshayahu, as stated in his opening Pasuk, lives during the reigns of Uzziyah through Chizkiyahu. Accordingly, Yeshayahu lives more than one hundred years before the Churban. Indeed, Chizkiyahu’s reign is followed by Menashe (who rules for fifty-five years), Amon, Yoshiyahu, Yehoyakim, and finally Tzidkiyahu, in whose time the Beit HaMikdash is destroyed. Accordingly, Yirmiyahu would have been a far superior choice to read on the Shabbat preceding Tishah Be’Av.",
                "Moreover, in Yeshayahu’s description of the land being destroyed, he describes Yerushalayim as being left as a remaining “hut in a vineyard” (Yeshayahu 1:8). This refers to the land of Israel made desolate by the invading Assyrians, who exiled the residents of the Northern Kingdom, and destroyed almost all of the Southern Kingdom, except for Yerushalayim, which was saved by the great miracle of Hashem smiting the huge Assyrian army one night while they were besieging Yerushalayim (Melachim II 18-19).",
                "This seems highly out of place on Shabbat Chazon, when we commemorate Yerushalayim’s destruction! Yirmiyahu, on the other hand, clearly communicates (Yirmiyahu 1:15 and throughout the Sefer) that Yerushalayim will be destroyed, and not spared as it was during the days of Chizkiyahu. Thus, the choice of Yeshayahu as the Haftarah of Shabbat Chazon is puzzling indeed. We offer three complementary answers to this vexing problem.",
                "<i><b>Yeshayahu Teaches that Hashem is Fair</b></i>",
                "One reason to read Yeshayahu 1 on Shabbat Chazon is to demonstrate that Hashem is fair. Yeshayahu promises us that if we improve, we shall “eat the goodness of the land” (Yeshayahu 1:19). On the other hand, he presents Hashem’s warning that if we refuse to improve and continue to rebel, “we shall be consumed by the sword.” Accordingly, we cannot complain to Hashem about the Churban, since He sent prophets to warn us even more than a century before the catastrophe.",
                "In Megillat Eichah, we express anger at Hashem in Pesukim such as “He drew His arrow like an enemy” (Eichah 2:4) and “He ambushes me like a bear, like a lion in waiting” (Eichah 3:4). We clarify in the Haftarah of Shabbat Chazon, however, that upon sober reflection, we realize that “Hashem is righteous in all His ways” (Tehillim 145:17).",
                "<i><b>Yeshayahu’s Message of Hope</b></i>",
                "We noted that Chazal characterize the book of Yirmiyahu as “entirely about destruction.” This is because, in Yirmiyahu’s time, the sentence of the Churban has already been pronounced by Chuldah (Melachim II 22:14-20). In fact, in Yirmiyahu 1:13, Hashem presents the image of a boiling pot to show that things have reached their boiling point and that Hashem is poised for the Churban. Hashem also shows Yirmiyahu an almond rod because the Hebrew word for almond, <i>Shakeid</i>, sounds like <i>Shokeid</i>, that Hashem is very much ready to fulfill His word, to destroy due to our great sins, without further delay. The commentators debate as to whether there is any hope of Teshuvah at this point (the Abarbanel argues that Teshuvah was still possible), but even if it were possible, the chance of success is very slim because of the overwhelming difficulty of repenting from the many sins that have accumulated over the generations.",
                "Yeshayahu, on the other hand, lives long before Chuldah issues her harsh prophecy. Yeshayahu is filled with prophecies of Nechamah (comfort), especially in Yeshayahu 40-66, from which we read seven selections as Haftarot in the seven weeks after Tishah Be’Av, the last being read the Shabbat preceding Rosh Hashanah. In Yeshayahu 2 and 11, the Navi presents grand prophecies of the Messianic age. Indeed, Chazal (ad. loc.) describe Yeshayahu as “entirely devoted to consolation.” Even Yeshayahu 1, which contains some very harsh words of rebuke (such as 1:4, 1:9 and 1:15) also presents promise for a better future if we improve ourselves (Yeshayahu 1:19). Yeshayahu even presents specific recommendations for how we can find redemption: “Zion will be redeemed with justice” (Yeshayahu 1:27).",
                "It is vitally important for us to hear the message of Yeshayahu before Tishah Be’Av instead of that of Yirmiyahu because our experience of Tishah Be’Av should not be one exclusively of mourning. Megillat Eichah concludes with the hopeful plea of “<i>Chadeish Yameinu KeKedem</i>,” that Hashem should reinstate His relationship of old with us, and rebuild the Beit HaMikdash. Moreover, R. Yosi ben Chanina teaches (Makkot 24a; as understood by Rav Kook) that the burden of cumulative sins that rested upon the generation of Yirmiyahu had been relieved after the Churban when Yechezkeil delivered the message that Hashem granted us a fresh start (Yirmiyahu 20). Thus, Yeshayahu’s message of hope is far more relevant to us than Yirmiyahu’s message of doom.",
                "<i><b>Yeshayahu’s Focus on Mitzvot Bein Adam LaChaveiro</b></i>",
                "There is yet another reason why Yeshayahu’s message is far more relevant to us than that of Yirmiyahu. Yirmiyahu notes that the primary reason for the destruction of the (first) Beit HaMikdash is the proliferation of idolatry amongst our ancestors (Yirmiyahu 1:16, inter alia). Fortunately, the zeal for idolatry has cooled (see Yoma 69b), and idolatry is not a primary concern for us today.",
                "Yeshayahu, however, focuses on justice and honest business dealings (Yeshayahu 1:21-23). In Yeshayahu 1, he makes no mention of idolatry. One may surmise that since this chapter reflects the realities of the time of the very righteous king Chizkiyahu, concern for idolatry is hardly relevant since Chizkiyahu has wiped Eretz Yisrael clean of idolatry and even Bamot (private altars outside the Beit HaMikdash), as recounted in Melachim II 18:4. Chizkiyahu rallies the Jewish people in an effort to rededicate the Beit HaMikdash and offer proper Korbanot (Divrei HaYamim II 29-30).",
                "Thus, the Assyrian onslaught and near destruction of Chizkiyahu’s kingdom leaves people wondering why we deserve such suffering, and why the merit of Chizkiyahu’s great deeds does not spare us from this terrible upheaval and turmoil. Yeshayahu answers these questions by telling us that although we are bringing many sacrifices and are dedicated to the Beit HaMikdash, Hashem is still angry at us due to our failures in our interpersonal relationships. The judicial system is corrupt (Yeshayahu 1:23) and people are dishonest in their business dealings (Yeshayahu 1:22).",
                "Yeshayahu’s message is more relevant to the sins that precipitate the destruction of the second Beit HaMikdash (Yoma 9b, Bava Metzia 30b, and the Netziv’s introduction to Sefer BeReishit), which are failures in interpersonal relationships. Sadly, this remains all too relevant for us today. Although we have seen a resurgence of observance of Mitzvot between man and Hashem during the past few decades, both in Israel and in North America, some would argue that we are lagging in our performance of interpersonal Mitzvot.",
                "It is heartening to visit weekday Minyanim, both in Israel and North America, that are filled to capacity with worshippers. This was hardly the case forty years ago and reflects an overall heightened awareness and level of observance of many aspects of the Halachah. One receives the impression, though, that the issues Yeshayahu complains about are not given the priority that they should be granted. Indeed, Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveichik (<i>Reflections of the Rav</i>, pp. 152-153) has remarked that the true test of a truly pious individual is the manner in which he deals in his financial and interpersonal affairs.",
                "<i><b>Conclusion</b></i>",
                "The Haftarah for Shabbat Chazon presents our generation with a great challenge. Our generation will be redeemed not only with heightened Shul attendance, higher Kashrut standards, and more Torah study, but also with the aspiration for the highest levels of respect shown to all individuals, and with our checkbooks being as kosher as our kitchens. We will only merit to realize the lofty visions of Yeshayahu if we heed his words that Zion will be redeemed with justice, and not only with the stringent observance of ritual."

        "Conclusion; Failure to Accept Rebuke, The Beginning and Ending Theme of Sefer Melachim": [
            "<b>Two Dominant Themes</b>",
            "If asked to identify the two dominant themes of Sefer Melachim, one can respond that the Sefer emphasizes [1] the call for wholehearted devotion and [2] the willingness to hear and implement Mussar (rebuke).",
            "<i><b>Wholehearted Devotion</b></i>",
            "Eliyahu HaNavi’s call for wholehearted devotion, “<i>Ad Matai Atem Posechim Al Shenei HaSe’ifim</i>,” “until when will you dance between two opinions” (Melachim I 18:21), looms large and reverberates throughout Sefer Melachim. Time and time again, the kings of the Southern and Northern Kingdoms and their subjects fail to fully accept Hashem and the truthfulness of His Torah. Eventually, the Bnei Yisrael’s interpersonal (see Yeshayahu 1) and spiritual failures result in the destruction of the first Beit HaMikdash and the Babylonian Exile.",
            "<i><b>Acceptance of Rebuke</b></i>",
            "In terms of willingness to accept rebuke, this theme not only pervades Sefer Melachim but also serves as its literary “bookends.” The Sefer begins by mentioning that David HaMelech never rebuked Adoniyahu (Melachim I 1:6). We hear this each year during the Haftarah of Parashat Chayei Sarah.",
            "The fact that David HaMelech never offers words of reproof to his son Adoniyah results in the latter’s inability to understand boundaries. As the son of the king, he is able to get anything he wants. He likely never learns the value of moderation. Thus, he is psychologically unbalanced, and is unable to cope with his being denied the kingship. He dies at a young age as a result of this failure, as he cannot reconcile himself with Shlomo’s ascension to the throne (as recorded at length in Melachim I 2).",
            "The story repeats itself at the end of Sefer Melachim. Yehoyakim and Tzidkiyahu, the last two kings of significant reign, distinguish themselves by their disregard of Yirmiyahu’s repeated and incessant warning of impending doom. Their dogged refusal to reconcile with the reality articulated by the Navi is articulated in full in Sefer Yirmiyahu. Had these kings accepted Yirmiyahu’s call to refrain from rebelling for seventy years against the Babylonians, the Churban would have been avoided.",
            "Stiff-necked refusal to accept prophetic Mussar is a recurrent theme throughout Sefer Melachim. Shlomo HaMelech tragically rejects the Achiyah HaShiloni-backed Mussar of Yarav’am ben Nevat, Yarav’am later rejects Achiyah HaShiloni’s Mussar, Achav rejects Eliyahu HaNavi and Michah ben Yimlah’s Mussar, Yehoram ben Achav rejects Elisha’s Mussar, and even Chizkiyahu does not act on the Mussar of Yeshayahu. Time and time again, the rejection of Mussar results in destruction.",
            "<i><b>David HaMelech as a Model</b></i>",
            "David HaMelech ranks high on our list of Jewish role models, since he took full responsibility for his actions, and was always willing to accept the Mussar of Natan the Navi. In fact, Shlomo HaMelech is able to rise to the throne due to David HaMelech’s acceptance of the Navi’s direction, as recorded in Melachim I 1. The kingship and Beit HaMikdash are lost to a great extent due to David’s descendants failing to follow in their illustrious ancestor’s path in this regard.",
            "Hopefully, a full immersion in Sefer Melachim should impact a person’s character. One who has truly inculcated the lessons of Sefer Melachim sees Mussar not as a nuisance or hindrance, but rather as an opportunity to improve and emerge in the class of David HaMelech. And in doing so, we will be able to reverse course on our path from David to Destruction, and instead set out on the journey to the renewed Malchut Beit David and Beit HaMikdash."

            "A cynic once commented that a commentary to Tanach can either be beautiful or faithful to the text, but not both. While this statement is not entirely true, it does capture the challenge faced by those who deliver Tanach Shiurim. Our listeners, on the one hand, demand authenticity. On the other hand, they expect the Shiurim to be beautiful and inspiring and that they emerge with a message that elevates them and enhances their lives as Jews. The constant struggle and challenge faced by Torah educators is the never-ending pursuit of Shiurim that succeed in being both authentic and beautiful.",
            "There is one more ingredient to a successful Shiur. Chazal teach that “<i>Ee Efshar LeBeit HaMidrash BeLo Chiddush</i>,” true Torah learning always includes novel approaches and ideas (Chagigah 3a). In other words, for a Shiur to be successful, the Maggid Shiur must not simply repeat that which was said by others. He must inject his own personality and insights into the learning.",
            "The recipe for a successful Shiur is, therefore, hours of preparation and deep thought. It does not matter how many years one has delivered Shiur on a particular topic. For compelling learning to emerge, enormous effort must be invested. Only with maximum effort and the support of Hashem can success be achieved, in line with the Gemara’s teaching “<i>Yagata Umatzata Ta’amin,” </i>that effort and success go hand in hand (Megillah 6b).",
            "Since 2009, I have been privileged to teach Sefer Melachim at the Torah Academy of Bergen County. The students’ relentless questioning and high expectations have created a very high bar for which I have invested my all to satisfy. <i>From David to Destruction</i> is the product of thousands of hours of hard work, deep thinking, and intense davening invested to create beautiful and faithful interpretations of Sefer Melachim. I hope it will inspire Jews throughout the world to appreciate the majesty of Sefer Melachim and the treasures that are just waiting to be revealed and discovered. In particular, I hope it will help Rabbanim and Mechanchim in their quest to deliver inspiring and compelling Shiurim on Sefer Melachim to their congregants and Talmidim.",
            "Nachum Krasnopolsky has invested countless hours to make my writings accessible. In the summer of 5778, together with the TABC alumnus Eitan Leff (’18), he tirelessly worked to gather and organize the thousands of articles in the Kol Torah archives to make them available online in an organized and attractive format at www.koltorah.org. The thousands of visitors the site attracts each month is an incredible testimony to the great service rendered by Nachum and Eitan.",
            "In the spring and summer of 5779, Nachum, in his disciplined and dedicated, yet modest and soft-spoken style, strove to elevate my writings on Sefer Melachim into the extraordinarily high-quality work that <i>From David to Destruction</i> has become. The gratitude my family and I have for Nachum’s stellar editorial work is endless. Our expectations have been dramatically exceeded. Nachum is the embodiment of the Gemara’s teaching that one has gained more from his Talmidim than he has from his Rebbeim and colleagues.",
            "I thank my son (and Torah Academy alumnus), Binyamin, who has contributed countless ideas that help create so many deep insights into Sefer Melachim. Binyamin is a fount of creative and out of the box thinking. It is always a pleasure and a deep source of satisfaction to partner with Binyamin in Torah learning.",
            "Dozens of TABC students and alumni are cited in this volume. It is such a pleasure and honor to cite the contributions of so many students from the past many years. I thank all of them for partnering in the noblest pursuit in life – to be able to extract the lessons Hashem is expressing in His holy Torah.",
            "I thank Rav Yosef Adler, Rosh Yeshiva of Torah Academy and Rav of Congregation Rinat Yisrael for his constant encouragement over the past twenty-four years at TABC and specific support for the publication of this work. Torah Academy’s administrators Rav Asher Yablok, Mr. Arthur Poleyeff, and Rav Ezra Wiener are also due an enormous debt of gratitude for their unending kindness and support.",
            "The breakfast table in the Torah Academy faculty lounge is a treasure of our Yeshivah. I can always rely on a significant discussion amongst the Rebbeim concerning the issues in Sefer Melachim which yields invaluable and enriching insights. I thank my wonderful colleagues for providing such a spiritually nourishing environment.",
            "I thank Hashem for the privilege of serving as the Rav of Congregation Shaarei Orah, the Sephardic Congregation of Teaneck. The formal and informal Torah discussions at Shaarei Orah are among my sweetest memories. May Hashem continue to send us many more years of beautiful weekday Tefillah, Shabbatot, and Yamim Tovim together. A special thank you to Heidi and Jack Varon for serving for so many years as the dedicated pillars of this wonderful Kehillah.",
            "I thank Rav Elazar Meyer Teitz, the Av Beit Din of Elizabeth, for adopting me into his family and allowing me to serve as a Dayan with the Beth Din of Elizabeth. With Rav Teitz’s wise guidance, the Beth Din of Elizabeth has flourished and achieved a stellar international reputation for balancing uncompromised fidelity to Halachah and sensitivity to human needs with its work in the fields of Get and Eruv administration.",
            "I thank my wife Malca for providing a loving and happy environment in our house. She is the source of happiness and joy of our home, where our children, Bracha and Yisroel, Binyamin, Chaya Zipporah, Atara, and Hillel grow and flourish with Hashem’s help. My, Baruch Hashem, many Shiurim and articles, easily flow in abundance due to the joyful environment Malca has created in our home. The accolade R. Akiva bestowed upon his family “<i>Sheli VeShelachem Shelah Hi</i>,” “my learning and your learning is all due to her,” applies at least in equal measure to Malca.",
            "May this work serve <i>Le’ilui Nishmat</i>, to elevate the souls of my parents, Ben and Shirley Jachter A”H. Although they never had the opportunity to know their daughter-in-law Malca and grandchildren, I am certain that they would have been enormously pleased with their complete dedication to Torah and high-quality character.",
            "May this work serve as a merit for my ailing father-in-law, Rav Shmuel Tokayer, and a source of comfort and support to my dedicated mother-in-law Mrs. Chana Tokayer. May Hashem extend them much Berachah, great support, and kindness.",
            "Most of all, I thank Hashem for fulfilling my dreams to be blessed with a loving spouse and children and to spend a life immersed in Kedushah (holy projects). As a young man, I dreamed of teaching Torah to teenagers, leading a friendly and warm Kehillah, contributing to Am Yisrael as a Dayan, and publishing valued works of Torah. Thank You, Hashem, for transforming all of these aspirations into reality. Thank You, Hashem, for facilitating such a large and loyal readership, way beyond any dreams I harbored. “<i>Mah Ashiv LaHashem Kol Tagmulohi Alai</i>,” I am overwhelmed with the enormous gratitude to which I owe our Creator (Tehillim 116:12). May it be His Will to continue bestowing all these blessings for many decades to come.",
