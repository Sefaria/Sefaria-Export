According to another interpretation, he warned them that they are not stronger than the \"man\" that \"I killed\" and if they think that he would not hurt them because they are women, behold, he has also killed a child, so he would not hesitate to harm them as well.

A <i>tanin</i> [תנין] is a \"crocodile\" in this language, like in Yechezkel 29:3 \"The great crocodile [<i>hatanim</i> התנים] that crouches in the midst of his streams\". And he didn't do the second sign in front of Par'oh, to bring his hand out from his breast and behold it was afflicted with tzara'at like snow, because if he had been afflicted with tzara'at they would have removed him from Par'oh's presence, and something like this is in Bereishit 50, that Yosef didn't have permission to come before Par'oh when he was still <i>tamei meit</i> before he had buried his father. [In Bereishit 50:4 Yosef lays a petition before the court of Par'oh rather than going directly to Par'oh]"

It was just that they weren't careful not to enter at that moment, and when the fire descended it killed them, and it was like an accident. But regardless, they sinned, since they should have paid attention to this since on that day they shouldn't have brought fire of their own accord, even though on other days this was one of their duties to bring it, as it is said above <b>And the sons of Aharon the Priest put fire on the altar</b> (Vayikra 1:7). And so said the Holy Blessed One: <b>\"In My close ones I will be made holy\"</b> (Vayikra 10:3) - for those who are accustomed to come near Them need to be careful and separated, so that they do not act out of custom, as it says in Yeshayahu 29:13, \"<b>[their fear of Me is like] the commandment of men learned by rote</b>\". And this is as it says in Sanhedrin 52a, \"burning the soul but the body remains [intact]\". Measure for measure, for Nadav and Avihu acted seemingly according to halacha, only they didn't pay attention to what the Holy Blessed One required of them at that moment. For this reason, they were burnt within (the seat of the intellect and reason), and their bodies remained externally whole."
