            "I was intimidated and concerned. I had never taught Sefer Yonah (the book of Jonah) and the Torah Academy of Bergen County had assigned me four sections of Sefer Yonah. I worried and fretted as I looked ahead. However, as I began to immerse myself in Sefer Yonah and its many and varied Mefarshim (commentaries) it dawned on me that Sefer Yonah is a Sefer like no other in its potential for rich discussion and insight.",
            "The four different groups at Torah Academy eagerly embraced Sefer Yonah and shared their thoughts and reflections on the very fundamental issues raised in this magnificent Sefer. I thank this group of nearly one hundred Orthodox teenagers for the electrifying learning experience and the many outstanding questions and answers shared.",
            "The learning was so special we decided that we wanted to share this experience with the broader community. I thank my son (and Torah Academy Talmid - student) Binyamin who, in the midst of his learning at Yeshivat Shaalvim in Israel, partnered with me in creating a work which helps reveal deep insights of Sefer Yonah and its profound connection to Yom Kippur. Binyamin brilliantly recommended including Torah Academy alumnus Aryeh Krischer in our project to edit and enhance our work. Aryeh has exceeded our expectations in smoothing out the language and contributing important questions and insights.",
            "I thank Rav Yosef Adler, Rosh Yeshiva of Torah Academy and Rav of Congregation Rinat Yisrael for his constant encouragement and specific support for the publication of this work. Torah Academy’s administrators Rav Asher Yablok, Mr. Arthur Poleyeff and Rav Ezra Wiener are also due a debt of gratitude for their kindness and support.",
            "The breakfast table in the Torah Academy faculty lounge is a treasure of our Yeshiva. I can always rely on a significant discussion amongst the Rebbeim concerning the issues in Sefer Yonah which yields invaluable and enriching insights. I thank my wonderful colleagues for providing such a spiritually nourishing environment.",
            "I thank Hashem for the privilege of serving as the Rav of Congreagtion of Shaarei Orah, the Sephardic Congregation of Teaneck. The breaks during the Yom Kippur Tefilah in which we delve deeply into Sefer Yonah are among my sweetest memories. May Hashem continue to send us many more years of beautiful Shabbatot and Yamim Tovim together. Special thank you to Heidi and Jack Varon for enabling this wonderful Kehillah.",
            "I thank my wife Malca and children Bracha and Yisroel Meir, Binyamin, Chaya Zipporah, Atara, and Hillel for providing a loving and happy environment in our house. My, Baruch Hashem, many Sefarim and articles easily flow due to the joyful environment in our home. The accolade Rabi Akiva bestowed upon his family “Sheli VeShelachem Shelah Hi,” “my learning and your learning is all due to her”, applies at least in equal measure to my family.",
            "May this work serve LeIlui Nishmat, to elevate the souls of my parents Ben and Shirley Jachter a”h. Although they never had the opportunity to know their daughter-in-law Malca and grandchildren, I am certain that they would have been enormously pleased with their high quality character.",
            "May this work serve as a merit for my ailing father-in-law Rav Shmuel Tokayer and a source of comfort and support to my dedicated mother-in-law Mrs. Chana Tokayer. May Hashem extend them both great support and kindness.",
            "Most of all, I thank Hashem for fulfilling my dreams to be blessed with a loving spouse and children, and to spend a life immersed in Kedushah, holy projects. As a young man I dreamed of teaching Torah to teenagers and leading a friendly and warm Kehillah (congregation). Thank you Hashem for transforming these aspirations into reality. Thank you Hashem for facilitating such a large and loyal readership, way beyond any dreams I harbored. “Mah Ashiv LaHashem Kol Tamolehi Alai”, I am overwhelmed with the enormous gratitude to which I owe our Creator (Tehillim 116:12). May it be His Will to continue bestowing all these blessings for many decades to come."

                    "<big><strong>Chapter 1 - A Sefer Like No Other - Radak’s Stunning Question</strong></big>",
                    "The question itself is shocking. Radak, a premier commentator, asks why the Tanach (Torah, Prophets, and Writings) would bother to include a Nevuah (prophecy) directed to the population of Nineveh, all of whom were not Jewish. The question presumes that the Tanach collects and records Hashem’s communications only as they pertain to the Jewish people. Indeed, Radak notes, Yonah is the only Sefer (book) in Tanach in which Jews play no role<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sefer Iyov, though, deals entirely with non-Jews. Radak might, as does the Rambam, subscribe to the belief that Iyov is a parable and so the fact that Iyov is not Jewish also is irrelevant. </i>.",
                    "<b>Support for the Radak’s Question</b><br>The eighth of Tevet, two days before the fast on the tenth of Tevet, is regarded in Piyyutim (liturgical poetry) as a day of mourning for our people. Chazal teach that the eighth of Tevet is the day king Ptolemy compelled seventy sages of Israel to translate the Torah into Greek (Megillah 9a). This Gemara makes clear that the Torah is directed exclusively at the Jewish People and thus provides evidence for the Radak’s presumption.",
                    "<b>Radak’s Three Answers</b><br>Radak answers that Sefer Yonah is incorporated into Tanach since Nineveh’s Teshuvah (repentance) serves as a model and inspiration for future Teshuvah<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This also clearly explains why Chazal (Megillah 31a) instituted the reading of Sefer Yonah on Yom Kippur at Minchah.</i>. Nineveh provides an especially good role model since the people repented the first time they heard rebuke from a Navi. Their actions also serve as somewhat of a rebuke to us: if non-Jews were rebuked once and repented, all the more so we, who constitute Hashem’s special nation, should certainly heed the call of genuine spiritual leaders to repent.",
                    "Another reason given to include Sefer Yonah in Tanach is to record the great miracles described therein for all generations. Indeed, Ramban at the conclusion of Parashat Bo writes that recognition and acknowledgement of Hashem’s open miracles leads to an appreciation of the daily hidden miracles Hashem performs for us.",
                    "Finally, Radak notes that Hashem accepts Teshuvah and extends forgiveness to all nations of the world. Sefer Yonah clarifies for us that indeed “VeRachamav Al Kol Ma’asav,” “Hashem extends His mercy to all of His creations” (Tehillim (Psalms) 145:9).",
                    "Sefer Yonah broadens the horizons and perspectives of Jews to include all of the world’s inhabitants. As the Sefer concludes, how could Hashem <i>not</i> be concerned and emotionally invested in a large city of more than one hundred twenty thousand people?",
                    "Although Hashem undoubtedly reserves His special love for Am Yisrael, His special nation, Hashem is invested in the spirituality and well-being of every person<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although Hashem was displeased with the translation of the Tanach into Greek, He did not foil this effort (see Megillah 3a, Megillah 9a, and the Piyyutim for Asarah BeTevet. Apparently, on some level Hashem wanted all of Tanach to be translated and all peoples exposed to the great lessons communicated by the Book of Books. The displeasure with the translation might stem from its inaccuracies. See Gemara and commentary for more details.</i>. He is called “מלך העולם” (king of the entire world) after all. So it’s not just about us. As the Ramchal teaches, the universe is created for Man to choose well, Jews and non-Jews alike. In addition to the universal responsibility to choose well, the Jews have a special responsibility to bear.",
                    "Additionally, Sefer Yonah has made a great stride toward bettering the world and its population. Yonah/Jonah is a wildly popular biblical story which has successfully communicated to all nations of the world that Hashem cares about every human being and that every human being is redeemable. Perhaps it is because of these essential lessons that Hashem influenced Sefer Yonah to be written in a most compelling manner that in every generation attracts untold millions to its powerful messages.",
                    "<b>Conclusion</b><br>Of course, the most obvious reason to include Sefer Yonah in Tanach is its grappling with some of the most fundamental issues of Torah life. At the heart of Sefer Yonah is the struggle between Yonah’s advocacy for the administration of Middat HaDin, Hashem’s attribute of strict justice, and Hashem’s insistence on the necessity of Middat HaRachamim, Hashem’s merciful aspects. It seems that Radak does not offer this answer, perhaps because this tension is readily discernable and did not require Radak’s insight.",
                    "Perhaps, though, because the tension is so readily discernable, Yonah is an ideal choice to read on Yom Kippur. At the height of the Yom HaDin (Day of Judgement) we are reminded that Hashem conducts Himself with a balance of Din and Rachamim, and that even the most undeserving can still repent."

                    "<big><strong>Chapter 2 - Why Did Yonah Flee? - Part One</strong></big>",
                    "It is unprecedented and unparalleled in any other situation in Tanach! Why would Yonah flee from Hashem? Why would a Navi refuse to go to Nineveh and comply with Hashem’s command? This is the central question of Sefer Yonah and resolving this problem will lead us to the essence of the message of this great Sefer.",
                    "<b>Explanation Number One - Yonah is a Straightforward Sinner</b><br>None of the Mefarshim (commentators) (to the best of my knowledge) adopt the approach that Yonah is a simple and straightforward run of the mill sinner. However, the reader/listener to Sefer Yonah, who might not take the time to delve deeply into the meaning of the Sefer, might easily receive this erroneous impression. One might think the story of Yonah is simply the story of a sinner who is punished and performs Teshuvah and repents, serving as a role model for us especially as we read Sefer Yonah on Yom Kippur.",
                    "The reasons why none of the Mefarshim adopt such an approach are manifold. To begin, simply to reach the level of a Navi one must be of great spiritual character and stature. The Rambam (Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah 7:1) writes:",
                    "Nevuah (prophecy) rests only upon one with great knowledge and wisdom, heroic in his personal attributes, one whose Yetzer HaRa (evil inclination) never overcomes him and whose thinking is very wide and correct<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is especially so regarding a Navi chosen to deliver Mussar (rebuke). </i>.",
                    "Moreover, why would Hashem make a series of extraordinary miracles such as with the fish and then later with the Kikayon for a petty sinner? Finally, Yonah describes himself while in the throes of a ferociously intense conversation during a fierce storm as “Ivri Anochi VeEt Hashem Elokei HaShamayim Ani Yarei,” “I am a Hebrew and the God of the Heavens I fear” (Yonah 1:9).",
                    "Yirat Shamayim, Fear of Heaven [Hashem], fundamentally means respect of God. Yonah defines himself during an intensely existential moment as one who deeply reveres the Ribbono Shel Olam (Master of the Universe). If Yonah fears Hashem then there must be something deeper, believe all the Mefarshim, for Yonah’s singular rebellion.",
                    "<b>Explanation Number Two - Rashi to 4:1 vs. Ibn Ezra</b><br>Rashi<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To clarify, Rashi adopts this approach only to explain Yonah’s displeasure at Hashem forgiving Nineveh. He does not explicitly offer this as a reason for Yonah’s flight to Tarshish. Pirkei D’Rabi Eliezer, though, does explain Yonah’s flight based on this reason.</i>, following Pirkei D’Rabi Eliezer, raises the idea that Yonah fears to appear as a Navi Sheker (false prophet). Yonah anticipates that Nineveh will be receptive to his message and that they will repent, leading Hashem to forgive them. Thus, his warning that Nineveh will be destroyed in forty days (3:4) would go unfulfilled leading Yonah to fear that he would be regarded as a fraud.",
                    "Ibn Ezra (1:1) offers a scathing critique of this approach. He asks the obvious question - how could this concern justify rebellion against Hashem<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One may add: why would it be sensible for Yonah to accept the certain designation as a Navi who is Koveish Nevuato, refuses to deliver his prophecy, to avoid the mere possibility of being classified as a Navi Sheker? </i>? Moreover, the people of Nineveh live so far away from Yonah’s residence in Eretz Yisrael why would he care about how he is regarded in Nineveh? Yonah could have presented his prophecy, left Nineveh, and never been heard from again in that region.",
                    "Finally, the people of Nineveh would not be foolish to the extent of calling Yonah a liar. After all, they readily understood that in order to be saved they needed to do Teshuvah. It was obvious to the people of Nineveh that Yonah issued a warning only because there was an opportunity to overturn the decree with Teshuvah<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is yet another reason for reading Yonah on Yom Kippur, as it clinches the principle that Teshuvah can overturn a heavenly punishment, as the celebrated Piyut recited by Ashkenazim on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur states “UTeshuvah UTefilah UTzedakah Maavirin Et Roah HaGezeirah,” “repentance, prayer and charity can overturn the evil portion of a decree.” </i>. Accordingly, why would Nineveh regard Yonah as a Navi Sheker if they recognize they were saved because they did Teshuvah?",
                    "Therefore the Ibn Ezra utterly rejects the opinion of Rashi following the Pirkei D’Rabi Eliezer<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torah Academy of Bergen County student Max Schmutter adds that had Yonah been concerned about being labeled a Navi Sheker, he could have or should have explicitly stipulated that the decree of destruction applies only if they do not do Teshuvah. One may respond that Yonah fears that Hashem will not permit him to exercise control over the words that he says to Nineveh, similar to Bilam who tried and failed to curse the Jews. Thus, Yonah may have feared that he would not the option to make this stipulation. Aryeh Krischer responds to this potential fear by pointing out that in general prophets shape the messages they give (Sanhedrin 89a) and Bilam is the exception since he tried to go against the will of Hashem.</i>. Indeed, none of the other Mefarshim adopt the approach of Rashi/Pirkei D’Rabi Eliezer.",
                    "<b>Understanding Rashi on a Deeper Level</b><br>Besides Ibn Ezra’s seemingly irrefutable arguments, as my Torah Academy of Bergen County students argued, Rashi’s approach, simply put, makes Yonah seem petty. Would Yonah prefer the more than one hundred and twenty thousand residents of Nineveh perish<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One could argue that Yonah does not consider these lives as important since in his calculation they deserve to die, as we shall later discuss. </i> rather than he be accused of being a false prophet? This sort of attitude does not at all seem compatible with the Rambam’s aforementioned description of a Navi.",
                    "Instead, we suggested that Rashi does not mean that Yonah was merely concerned about preserving his reputation. Rather, he was concerned for Kiddush Hashem (sanctifying Hahsem), specifically about avoiding a Chillul Hashem (desecrating Hashem). Yonah was concerned, according to this approach, that the word of Hashem would never be taken seriously in the future if his warning to Nineveh would not materialize soon after he pronounced his prophecy.",
                    "Moreover, one may suggest, based on his name, that Yonah was deeply devoted to truth. Shmuel I 25:25 states “Ki Chishmo Kein Hu,” “a person’s essence is captured by his name.” Many have noted that Yonah is described in 1:1 as Yonah ben Amittai. His father’s name Ammitai derives from the word “Emet”, truth<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On the other hand, a “Yonah” is a dove, representing peace, yet Yonah fights that peace by working towards Nineveh’s death, trying to die himself, and raging against Hashem during the Kikayon episode. Elsewhere we discuss the meaning of the name Yonah. </i>, which indicates this trait was a fundamental part of Yonah’s name.",
                    "Yonah, as stated in Melachim II 14:25, is from the town of Gat Chefeir, which is located in the portion of the tribe of Zevulun (whose borders are delineated in Yehoshua 19:14). This means that Yonah lived in the Northern Kingdom (during the reign of the less than excellent Yoravam ben Yoash), which was steeped in Avodah Zarah (idolatry). Indeed, Hashem reports (Melachim I 19:18) that only seven thousand of the residents of the Northern kingdom refrained from idolatry. For Yonah to emerge as a prophet in such an environment, a deep and even fanatic devotion to truth was necessary.",
                    "Human nature craves to follow the herd and not to differ from societal norms. It takes an enormous devotion to truth to have the courage to deviate from the societal norm. Moreover, Chazal (cited by Rashi to Melachim I 9:1) report that Yonah was a disciple of the prophet Elisha. It is clear from Melachim II 4:42-43, 5:21-26, and 6:1-7 that the students of Elisha lived in dire poverty. To be a devotee of Elisha required a deep devotion to truth no matter what the cost, a devotion Yonah took too far.",
                    "I suggest that Rashi and Pirkei D’Rabi Eliezer view Yonah as someone who is single minded in his devotion to truth and that any deviation from truth is deeply disturbing and intolerable to him. For this reason, the mission to Nineveh was absolutely intolerable. Indeed, the Zohar (Shemot 193) writes that “Yonah emerges from the strength of Eliyahu [HaNavi]”. Chazal, in fact, believe that Yonah is the child that was revived by Eliyahu HaNavi in Melachim I 17:21-22. Eliyahu HaNavi along with Pinechas are the only characters in Tanach described as zealots (Bemidbar 25:11 and Melachim I 19:10 and 14). One may speculate that according to this view Yonah spent time with Eliyahu HaNavi after the revival and Yonah thereby adopted Eliyahu’s zealous devotion to truth.",
                    "<b>Conclusion</b><br>According to Rashi and Pirkei D’Rabi Eliezer, Yonah was Ben Amittai, a zealot for truth. A major theme of Sefer Yonah according to this approach is Hashem trying to temper and balance Yonah’s single minded devotion to truth with other Godly values.",
                    "One cannot focus exclusively only one Torah value. This is the import of the teaching of Shlomo HaMelech in Kohelet (7:16) that one should refrain from being too wise or too pious. Piety and wisdom constitute core Torah values. However, if one focuses exclusively on only one of these values, to the exclusion of all others, one has distorted the teachings and meaning of the Torah.",
                    "Yonah mistakenly focused exclusively on the value of truth to the exclusion of all of other values such as Chessed (kind deeds) and Teshuvah. According to Rashi and Pirkei D’Rabi Eliezer, through the experiences recorded in Sefer Yonah the prophet learns to balance out his profound devotion to truth with other Torah values as well.",
                    "Furthermore, notes Aryeh Krischer, Yonah’s fanatical devotion to truth and Din not only led him to ignore other Torah values, but also led him to actively disobey Hashem. The Gemara (Sotah 14a) learns proper values from Hashem by the principle of VeHalachta BeDrachav, and you shall walk in [Hashem’s] ways. More than simply having views lacking in nuance, Yonah’s flawed perception of proper values led to disregarding the ultimate value: to follow the will and ways of Hashem.",
                    "On Yom Kippur, we are summoned to take a hard-nosed and objective look at ourselves. We are called upon to discover not only that which we lack but also that to which we devote undue attention. This is the great balancing act that the Rambam teaches in Hilchot Deiot that constitutes the key to life: avoiding any extremes, with specific and very limited exceptions. Yonah’s misdirected emphasis on Din, justice, reminds us to remember this theme as the end of our Yom Kippur approaches. We must not only repent for the old, but adjust the new to ensure it too aligns with the will of Hashem.",
                    "We continue in our next chapter with more fascinating and insightful explanations of why Yonah disobeyed Hashem’s command to rebuke Nineveh."

                    "<b>Approach Number Three – Yonah Protecting Am Yisrael</b><br>According to the Midrash cited by Rashi, Ibn Ezra, and Radak, Yonah was trying to protect the image of our people. Yonah is concerned that if the people of Nineveh do Teshuvah, it will bring about a catastrophe to Am Yisrael.",
                    "Rashi (1:3) presents this idea as follows:",
                    "What motivated Yonah to refuse to go to Nineveh? He reasoned, ‘the non-Jews are easily led to Teshuvah. If I address them and they do Teshuvah then I will be Mechayeiv (condemn) the Jewish People who do not heed the words of the Neviim. ‘",

                    "Our rabbis taught: A poor person, a rich person, and an evil person come before the heavenly court. They ask the poor person, “Why did you not study Torah?” If the poor person answers, “I was poor and worried about earning a living,” they will ask the poor person, “Were you poorer than Hillel?” For it was told of Hillel that every day he used to work and earn one tropaik [small amount], half of which he would give as tuition to the doorkeeper at the House of Learning; the other half he would spend on his and his family’s needs. One day, he was unable to earn anything and the doorkeeper would not permit him to enter the House of Learning. So he climbed up to the roof and sat upon the window to hear the words of the Living God out of the mouths of Shmaya and Avtalion. That day was a Friday in the middle of winter, and snow fell on him from the sky. When the dawn rose, Shmaya said to Avtalion, “Brother Avtalion, every day, this house is light and today it is dark.” They looked up and saw the figure of a man in the window. They went up and found Hillel covered by four feet of snow. They brought him down, bathed and anointed him, and placed him in front of the fire...",
                    "They ask the rich person, “Why did you not study Torah?” If the rich person answers, “I was rich and preoccupied with my possessions,” they say to the rich person, “Do you mean to say you were richer than Rabi Elazar?” Of Rabi Eleazar ben Harsom, it is reported that his father left him an inheritance of one thousand cities on land and a thousand ships on sea. Yet every day he would take a sack of flour on his shoulder and go from city to city and province to province for the sole purpose of studying the Torah...",
                    "They ask the evil person, “Why did you not study Torah?” If the evil person says, “I was so good-looking that I was too busy just keeping my passions under control,” they will ask him, “Do you mean to say you were better-looking then Joseph?” It was told of Joseph the virtuous that every day Potiphar’s wife tried to seduce him with words and actions. The dresses she put on for him in the morning, she did not wear in the evening; those she put on in the evening, she did not wear the next morning. She said to him, “Yield to me!” He said, “No.” She said, “I will have you imprisoned” [if you don’t]...Finally, she offered him a thousand pieces of silver if only he would lie with her, but he refused...",
                    "Thus, the poor who do not study Torah stand condemned by the examples set by Hillel. The rich who do not study Torah stand condemned by the example set by Rabbi Eleazar ben Harsom. And the evil who do not study Torah stand condemned by the example set by Joseph.",
                    "Similarly, the Teshuvah of Nineveh will condemn the Jewish people by raising the bar for Teshuvah in the same manner in which Hillel raised the bar for Torah study for the poor, Rabi Eleazar ben Harsom raised the bar for Torah study for the wealthy, and Yosef HaTzadik raised the bar for resisting the Yetzer HaRa even in the most challenging of circumstances.",
                    "Rav Ben Zion Shafier offered the following information to help understand this idea: No one thought it was possible to run a mile in less than four minutes before 1954. Many made the effort but no one was able to do so. Many experts in human physiology claimed at that time that the human body is incapable of achieving this feat. However, once it was first achieved in 1954 by Roger Bannister in 3:59.4 the \"four-minute barrier\" was subsequently broken by many male athletes, and is now the standard of all male professional middle distance runners.",

As it grows up, the elephant is much stronger than necessary to remove the peg from the ground where it is stuck. Even so, fully grown elephants do not typically escape the circus. This phenomenon is due to the fact that the elephant has a psychological barrier telling it that it still is not strong enough to uproot the stake holding it down. But if the peg is accidentally pulled out of its spot, the elephant can never go back to its state of unknowing and inability. It will always be able to escape its pegged prison.",
                    "Similarly, once Nineveh would break the Teshuvah barrier it now sets the standard. Nineveh’s Teshuvah shows we are all capable of repenting, and there is no excuse for not doing so. Of course, where Yonah feared “breaking the Teshuvah barrier” we instead find a compelling reason to hear about the Teshuvah of the people of Nineveh on Yom Kippur.",
                    "According to this Midrash, Yonah sinned for a noble reason. This is called by Chazal (Nazir 23) an Aveirah Lishmah, a sin for the sake of goodness. This is certainly apparent in the manner in which Radak (1:1) presents this Midrash: Yonah advocated for the dignity of the son (i.e. our people, the Jews) and not for the dignity of the father (i.e. Hashem).",

These commentators note that Nineveh is, of course, the capital city of Assyria and that Assyria will emerge as our major enemy a few generations after Yonah. Yonah would prefer to have Assyria destroyed rather than effectively allow it to inflict immense damage<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One could question this approach by arguing that, since Hashem concluded that Am Yisrael deserved punishment, even if the Assyrians were destroyed Hashem would have chosen another nation (such as the Babylonians) to punish Am Yisrael. Indeed, Yeshayahu (10:5) presents Assyria as the “rod of Hashem” (Sheivet Api) - a substitute rod could be found. Similarly, Mitzrayim (Egypt) was not named in the Brit Bein HaBetarim (Covenant Among the Parts) as the people who would enslave and afflict our people (Bereishit 15:13) since Egypt did not necessarily have to be the nation that harmed us. </i>, both on the northern and southern kingdoms of Israel<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sefer Melachim and Sefer Yishayahu describe this damage extensively.

Upon visiting Lachish one sees, besides for the destroyed and corroded defenses, the palace of the city’s governor/prince completely demolished and barren, save for the base, which is how we know of its existence at all. It is a huge building, yet nothing of the structure remains since it was so brutally destroyed by the Assyrians.</i>.",

The Assyrians emerged as a dominant force in the region during the reign of Achaz, the thirteenth generation from King David. Yonah foresaw the development of Assyria into a regional power which would pose an enormous problem for our people.

Hashem tells Avraham to listen to Sarah, who then sends Hagar and Yishmael out into the desert with some bread and water. When their provisions run out, Hagar casts her son under a tree, moving away at some distance, not wanting to witness his death.

Chutz LeAretz (outside Israel) is the Tamei place from the story and Yonah, the slave, believes he can escape Hashem, the Kohen.

Da’at Mikra notes that Targum Yonatan translates Tarshish as sea every time it appears in Tanach when it refers to a location.

Indeed, the Spain option seems to fit best with Yonah’s motivation. It's in the opposite direction of his mission, it's the most drastic of places to go, and it gives him peace of mind that the status quo will continue to exist just as he wants.",
                    "<b>Supporting the Spain Option</b><br>Yonah most certainly presents throughout the Sefer as a character who goes to extremes.

Despite the great pressure placed on him in Perek 1 by both the storm and the sailors to repent, Yonah refuses to relent. In Perek 2 he does not call out to Hashem until he has spent three full days in the large fish. Chazal (Nedarim 38a) understand that Yonah paid the fare for the entire ship, expending an enormous sum to achieve his goals. Understanding Yonah as fleeing all the way to Spain is quite compatible with his temperament and personality.",
                    "<b>Implications of the Spain Option</b><br>If we understand that Yonah fled all the way to Spain, the Ibn Ezra’s Peshat/literal explanation of the phrase “VaYitein Secharah,” “and he paid its fare” (Yonah 1:3), is sensible. Chazal as quoted understand that “its fare” refers to Yonah paying for the entire ship’s fare. Radak explains this as an expression of Yonah wishing to leave as soon as possible. Torah Academy students suggest it shows Yonah’s desire to reduce the number of people he would expose to danger by his undertaking a journey which is likely to incur the wrath of God.",
                    "Ibn Ezra and Radak, however, offer a literal explanation of “its fare” that Yonah paid for his and only his fare.

This is not a problem if one adopts the Tarshish as Spain option. A trip to Spain in ancient times took a year, as reported in Bava Batra 38a. Professor Simon explains this based on frequent stops at ports for supplies and trade. Such an ambitious venture was made with expectations and hopes to make large profit. As such, Yonah would have had to expend a very large sum to pay for such a journey. Thus, recording Yonah paying such a huge sum expresses his burning desire to flee as far from Nineveh as possible.",
                    "Another implication of the identification of Tarshish in Sefer Yonah as Spain is in regards to the cargo shed by the sailors in their attempt to save themselves from the storm (1:5).

This underscores the extreme danger in which the sailors felt and the profound relief upon their survival<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The shedding of the cargo must have significant spiritual import, otherwise, it is difficult to understand why it is mentioned in Sefer Yonah. The sailors made a great spiritual advance as part of shedding their precious cargo. Some are so weighed down with very expensive items it prevents them from scaling and ascending the mountain of Hashem (paraphrasing Tehillim 24:3). Rav Avraham Pam tells of a Rosh Yeshiva who visited a Talmid who amassed considerable wealth and lived in an opulent home. The Rosh Yeshiva noted the very expensive wall paper and bemoaned the fact that the time the Talmid could have invested to master Masechet Berachot or Masechet Ketubot, was devoted to amassing wealth to afford such costly furnishings. The sailors’ shedding of the very expensive cargo certainly fits with the Rosh Yeshiva’s perspective. </i>.",

We are reminded by the opening events of the Sefer that even a flight to a modern day Tarshish will not remove us from the eyes of Hashem.

For example, the Gemara (Megillah 12a) wonders why the Jews portrayed in Megillat Esther deserved to endure the anxiety of the decree of Haman.</i> of the vicious storm Hashem unleashed on Yonah’s ship. Sechar VeOnesh (reward and punishment) is a fundamental principle of our faith (see, for example, Mishnah Sotah 1:7). God rewards and punishes in proportion to a person’s Mitzvot (good deeds) or Aveirot (sins). In Yonah’s case, his severe infraction of blatantly disregarding a direct order from God is met with the severe punishment of the terrible storm. However, asked my students at Torah Academy of Bergen County, what did the sailors do wrong that they had to endure such a terrible storm?",
                    "The storm, of course, was intended to teach Yonah a lesson. We think that the storm could be a reference to an incident with Eliyahu HaNavi, who according to Chazal is Yonah’s grand-Rebbe. Hashem tells Eliyahu that He isn’t found in the raging winds, but rather in the soft sound (Melachim I Perek 19). It seems that raging storms run against Hashem’s “nature”, so why use one here? We argue that Hashem shows Yonah that, just like He has gone out of His “comfort zone” to help Yonah progress, Yonah needs to leave his devotion to Din, to which he is naturally inclined, to help guide Ashur (Assyria) along the proper path. But our question remains unanswered: what can the sailors gain from the storm?",

                    "Ir HaNidachat (the case of the wayward city; Devarim 13:13-19) serves an excellent illustration of this principle. If the majority of a city’s inhabitants are found to be idol worshippers, the entire city is (at least in theory) subject to capital punishment. Even the minority of inhabitants who did not worship idols are subject to the death penalty. Woe is to the wicked, woe is to their neighbors. Similarly, the sailors may not have done anything wrong, but nonetheless their proximity to Yonah’s wickedness in fleeing Hashem left them as “collateral damage”. Evidence to this answer is the fact that when the sailors disposed of Yonah the storm abated, indicating Yonah was the sole cause of the storm.",
                    "The comparison to Ir HaNidachat is questionable, though. The minority who were innocent of idolatry are put to death since they witnessed their neighbors serve idols and the former group did not either protest or leave the town. Yonah’s shipmates, however, did not have either option. The ship’s crew presumably did not know of Yonah’s rebellion against the divine command and they certainly did not have the option of leaving the ship once the storm hit and they engaged Yonah in conversation and discovered his sin<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Alternatively, one might interpret 1:10 “Ki YaDeu HaAnashim Ki MiLifnei Hashem Hu Boreiach Ki Higid Lahem”, as Yonah having told the sailors of his flight from God upon his embarking the journey. After all, the spectacle of Yonah’s paying the entire ship’s fare (according to Nedarim 38a) is likely to have sparked questions and perhaps an explanation from Yonah.</i>. A bigger problem with this approach, is that Oy LeRasha, Oy LeShcheino must carry the connotation “your bad neighbors will lead you astray”. Otherwise how could the corollary of this principle, Tov LeTzadik, Tov LeShcheino (fortune to the righteous, fortune to his neighbor) exist<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is apparent from Rashi to Bemidbar 3:29 and 38.

If so, we can apply the principle of Megalgilin Chov Al Yidei Chayav, Hashem brings about difficult experiences through evil people (Shabbat 32a). In other words, the sailors were not quite innocent bystanders and were therefore made to endure the storm along with Yonah. After all, Avodah Zarah is one of the seven Noahide Laws (Sheva Mitzvot Bnei Noach) and is regarded as a sin so severe that Jewish law rules YeiHareig VeAl Ya’vor, better to die than to worship idols.",

Moreover, we will see later in our studies that Hashem treated Nineveh leniently to a great extent because he considered them as Tinok SheNishbah in regards to their worship of idols.",

                    "One Torah Academy student suggested that the sailors were, using cinematic terminology, “extras”. Thus, Hashem and Yonah (and the people of Nineveh) are pretty much the only characters in Sefer Yonah that “matter”. The sailors are merely background scenery and support staff and the storms impact on the sailors is not part of Hashem’s calculations.",

From the perspective of a movie producer, the sailors are “extras”, secondary players who are not sufficiently important to merit significant consideration. However, from Hashem’s perspective, no one is an “extra” and no one is unimportant. As the Mishnah (Sanhedrin 4:5) teaches “Man was created as a single being to teach that whoever kills one person is as if he killed an “Olam Malei,” an entire world. In the Torah’s perspective each human being is evaluated as an Olam Malei and cannot be dismissed as a mere “extra”. “Tov Hashem LaKol VeRachamav Al Kol Maasav,” “Hashem is good to all and His mercy extends to all his creations” (Tehillim 145:9).",

The trainees are placed in a wide range of predicaments in order for them to actualize their potential as leaders. Similarly, Hashem placed Avraham Avinu and Yitzchak Avinu into the Nisayon of Akeidat Yitzchak (Binding of Isaac) in order to actualize their latent spiritual greatness.",
                    "One may say the same regarding the sailors. The terrible ordeal of the storm brought about great spiritual and interpersonal growth among the sailors.

At times we may be placed in an ordeal in which we experience considerable physical and/or psychological suffering.

The sailors serve as powerful role models to teach us how much we can grow if we adopt the proper perspective. This is an especially important message for us to hear on Yom Kippur, as the fast we much endure is intended to propel and ignite us to reach great heights."

                    "“Why did the captain abandon his sailors on deck and reach out to Yonah to pray?” asked my Torah Academy of Bergen County students. Could not have the captain sent a subordinate to try to convince Yonah to pray? A captain abandoning his sailors during a severe crisis is most unusual at best and egregiously irresponsible at worst!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Binyamin Jachter responds: Why send a subordinate into the most dangerous part of the ship (assuming that the bottom of the boat is the most dangerous location on the ship because if the boat starts to sink, it is the easiest place to drown)? That would be cowardly and bad leadership. The captain goes head-first into the danger to save his crew. Aryeh Krischer responds to Binyamin: In a situation like the storm the captain’s leadership on deck may well be the only thing that keeps the boat from sinking.</i>",
                    "<b>A most “Jewish” Rebuke</b><br>Moreover, the language employed by the captain is decidedly “Jewish”. After pushing Yonah to call out to his God, the captain says perhaps “HaElokim”, “the God” (Yonah 1:6) will listen to our prayers. The captain, who began the Pasuk with pagan assumptions that Yonah’s God is one among many, suddenly shifts into a monotheistic mode, invoking “the” (i.e. singular) God. Perhaps the captain is tailoring his words to his audience - Yonah. But the captain began by appealing to Yonah to call out to Elokecha, your God. Moreover, if the captain was aware of Yonah’s religious position why does he inquire into Yonah’s religion once Yonah arrives on deck?",
                    "Furthermore, the attitude expressed by the words “perhaps Hashem will listen to us”, is (as noted by Professor Uriel Simon) decidedly Jewish. Moshe Rabbeinu express such an attitude upon his ascending to Har Sinai to appeal for clemency for the Cheit HaEigel (Shemot 32:30) “Ulai Achaperah Bead Chatatchem”, “<i>perhaps</i> I will achieve atonement for your sins”. Numerous other examples abound in Tanach.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ashkenazic Jews recite in Selichot the refrain “Ulai Yachus Al Am Oni VeEvyon Ulai Yerucheim,” “perhaps He will feel concern for the poor nation perhaps He will have compassion.” This echoes the statement of the ship’s captain “perhaps God will listen”. Other examples in Tanach include David HaMelech declaring Mi Yodeia VeChanani Hashem VeChai HaYaled,” “who knows perhaps Hashem will forgive me and allow the child to live” (Shmuel II 12:22). The Gemara (Chagigah 4b) stresses this idea as well repeatedly stating in connection with our efforts in regards to Hashem “Kuli Hai VeUlai”, all this effort is invested and yet only might yield the desired result. </i> The question, accordingly, emerges as to how did a pagan know to formulate his words in complete harmony with Jewish values?",
                    "Moreover, the captain’s rebuking Yonah “Mah Lecha Nirdam,” “how can you sleep at a moment like this?” (1:6), resonates deeply with Sephardic Jews, as this rebuke is paraphrased at the beginning of the Sephardic Selichot services. Rambam (Hilchot Teshuvah 3:4) expresses a point similarly, that the role of the Shofar is to arouse those who have fallen into the trap of a spiritual slumber. Again the question emerges, how did the pagan know how to talk in a Jewish style to Yonah?",
                    "My students noted that this ship was docked in the Jaffa harbor. The sailors, or at least the captain, are likely at that time to have learned a significant amount about Judaism and therefore the captain knew how to modify his speech when talking to a pious Jew. The problem with this approach is that the sailors’ later inquiries of Yonah when he is on deck creates the impression that they are unaware of Yonah’s belief system.",
                    "I suggest something a bit more ambitious. The Torah presents situations where Hashem completely “hijacks” a person and his speech. The classic example is when Hashem “hijacked” Bilam’s mouth to have him bless Bnei Yisrael. Another example is Hashem hardening Paroh’s heart. I suggest in turn that Hashem commandeered the mouth of the captain of Yonah’s ship to rebuke him<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In our High Holiday Piyyutim, Poetic Liturgy, Hashem is sometimes referred to as “Rav HaChoveil”, the captain of the ship. In fact, the term Rav HaChoveil in our Pasuk may be understood as referring both to the ship’s captain and alluding to Hashem. Rav HaChoveil literally means the one in charge of the ropes. This is an apt description of Hashem who is the one in charge of subtly maneuvering the ropes or “pulling the strings” behind the scenes in His delicate guiding and balancing the world.</i>.",
                    "This is reminiscent of the Gemara (Avodah Zarah 17a) recounting the sordid story of Elazar ben Dordiah, who visited a Zonah (harlot) in a far off land all. Suddenly she stuns him by giving him hauntingly poignant Mussar (rebuke). How did the harlot who was so removed from even any remote connection to Jewish life know to rebuke Rabi Elazar ben Dordiah in a most powerful and Jewish way? I suggest that Hashem “hijacked” the harlot and it was as if Hashem spoke directly to Elazar ben Dordiah. His extreme reaction indicates that Elazar ben Dordiah realizes that it was none other than Hashem who was rebuking him. Similarly, I suggest that Hashem “hijacked” the ship’s captain to deliver poignant and Jewish style words of rebuke. This hypothesis resolves all of the questions we posed on the captain’s behavior. Hashem hijacked the captain to leave his post at a time of crisis and to speak to Yonah in a most Jewish style. Hashem’s intent was to drive home a point to Yonah, and Yonah who is trained to detect Hashem’s presence should easily discern Hashem as the true speaker.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to the Malbim, Yonah does not simply remain in Eretz Yisrael and ignore Hashem’s call to visit Nineveh, because he fears Hashem will “hijack” him and force him to rebuke Nineveh if he does not flee Eretz Yisrael.</i>",
                    "<b>Conclusion:</b><br>Hashem has tried communicating directly with Yonah (1:1) and then indirectly through the storm. Yonah clings to his stubborn and unyielding approach despite a most vigorous reproof from Hashem. Hashem tries to spur Yonah to action by speaking through the ship’s captain<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Recall our discussion of Yonah’s deep sleep, where Yonah shut himself down from Hashem who is trying to engage him through the storm.</i> but once again Yonah refuses to relent, much to his and his fellow-travelers’ detriment.",

At the height of the “storm” of Yom Kippur the “Rav HaChoveil” addresses us listeners as well imploring us to awaken from our spiritual slumber to a more invigorating and vigorous spiritual life."

Accordingly, Yonah might have been indispensable as the Navi with the personality uniquely appropriate to communicate to Nineveh in the strongest terms that they will be completely wiped out if they do not immediately improve.",
                    "Proof of the appropriateness of Yonah to express this message is the fact that Nineveh responded so unanimously and forcefully to his message. Yonah was the best and possibly only choice for the task to deliver Hashem’s warning to Nineveh. Thus, Hashem chose to save Yonah rather than find a replacement.",
                    "<b>Answer Number Two - The Triumph of Rachamim over Din</b><br>Alternatively, we may explain that Hashem does not want Din, and therefore Yonah as the personification of Din, eradicated from the world. If He did, then Yonah would never have received the Nevuah and the world would not have been created with Din in the first place. Rather, Hashem wants Yonah’s sense of Din to be transformed into a better balance of Din and Rachamim (see Rashi to Bereishit 1:1 s.v. Bara Elokim). Hashem’s wants Yonah to change his mind, not to die.",

Yonah is the only Navi in the Tanach who actively seeks to get out of a divine mission. Yonah flees to Chutz LaAretz (outside of Israel) as a “safe zone” where he thinks he can side step Hashem’s command. He retreats to the bottom of the ship and even asks to be tossed into the sea to avoid the mission on which Hashem has sent him.",
                    "By saving Yonah from the ravages of the sea, Hashem communicates to Yonah and to Jews of all generations that a Jew cannot evade the divine mission upon which he is sent. “Af Al Pi Shechata, Yisrael Hu”, a Jew who sins is still a Jew (Sanhedrin 44a). A Jew who converts out of his religion remains a Jew, as there is no opt out option for a Jew.",
                    "Rav Yosef Dov Soloveitchik eloquently presents Yonah as the paradigm for Hashem not permitting a Jew to escape his destiny, in his essay “Kol Dodi Dofeik”.

Rav Soloveitchik cites Yonah in the fourth knock he presents<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Joseph B.

The era of divine self-concealment (Hastarat Panim) at the beginning of the 1940’s resulted in great confusion among the Jewish masses and, in particular, among the Jewish youth…Buried, hidden thoughts and paradoxical reflections emerge from the depths of the souls of even the most avowed assimilationists. And once a Jew begins to think and contemplate, once his sleep is disturbed—who knows where his thoughts will take him, what form of expression his doubts and queries will assume?”",
                    "Rav Soloveitchik thinks “it is good for a Jew not to be able to hide from his Jewishness.” Like Yonah, even the self-haters will find no refuge in the innermost depths of their respective ships. Like Yonah, again, when asked “Who are you?” they should answer “I am a Hebrew, and I fear the Lord, the God of heaven.”",

Why, then, did He save Yonah in a most extraordinary manner?",
                    "We put forth a bold possibility. We developed the idea that Yonah symbolizes the entire Am Yisrael and that Hashem will not permit our entire nation to spiritually self-destruct. Rashi (to Bereishit 15:10 s.v. VeEt HaTzipor Lo Batar) writes that the Jewish people are compared to a dove. This is most appropriate since a dove is the quintessential example of a kosher bird.",
                    "In Shir HaShirim, a parable for the relationship between Hashem and Am Yisrael, the woman (Raayah; i.e. the Jewish people) is often compared to a dove (see, for example, Shir HaShirm 1:15, 2:14, 4:1, and 5:2). The Midrash (Shir HaShirim Rabbah 1:2 and 2:14) explains at length the comparison between a Yonah/dove and the Jewish people. Here is one example: “Just like a dove once she meets her mate never leaves him for another… just as a dove whose fledglings are taken from her nest still doesn't abandon her nest…, so are the Jewish people faithful to G‑d.”",
                    "Most popularly, the Jewish people’s appreciation for Shabbat is described in the poem ascribed to Rabi Yehudah HaLevi “Yonah Matzah Bo Manoach,” “Yonah (dove) found in it [Shabbat] rest.” The linking of the dove and the Jewish people is a most solid one.",
                    "Accordingly, it could be that the Yonah the prophet, not the bird, might also symbolize the Jewish people, especially if we understood Yonah’s motivation to flee as completely on behalf of the Jewish people. Based on this, we suggest that Hashem’s rescue of Yonah from the ravages of the sea despite his willingness to destroy himself represents Hashem’s rescue of the Jewish people’s spirit, even if we willingly try to shed it.",
                    "Hashem promised that the Torah will never be forgotten completely from the Jewish people (Rashi to Devarim 31:21). Thus, even if we will willingly cast off the Torah, Hashem will ensure that it is not completely forgotten, just as He did not permit Yonah to let himself be destroyed. Hashem might not intervene and save an individual Jew from destroying himself either physically or spiritually. However, He most certainly will intervene and not permit the total physical or spiritual elimination of Am Yisrael.",
                    "The Jewish people were well on the road to spiritual self-destruction in the late 1940’s and early 1950’s. In the United States there were no more than a few hundred yeshiva students and even in Israel, Ben-Gurion was willing to exempt Yeshiva students from the draft since there were so few of them. Moreover, Ben Gurion and his advisors’ expectation was that the secularization of the Jewish people was inevitable and that there would soon be no Yeshiva students left in a matter of a decade or two. The architect of the modern State of Israel could not have foreseen the intervention of the Beloved Hashem who helped revive Torah study around the world to the extent that there are hundreds of thousands of full-time devotees of Torah study worldwide.",

He wants life, but as he sees fit, and he is also willing to die for his cause. Working with the suggested approach of convincing Yonah to the side of Rachamim, the only way for Hashem to convince Yonah was to show him he did not have the option to live as he wants or die protecting Bnai Yisrael. Yonah is placed in a state of limbo, accomplishing nothing, which is devastating for Yonah. It forces him to make the choice to live as Hashem wants. It is a clear message to him and to us that we cannot devise our own rules and morals but must adhere to the objective morality of Hashem.</i> might foreshadow the miraculous survival of our people in Galut/Exile. Indeed, Bava Batra 73b compares the Galut to a large fish. The Gemara records Rabbah Bar Bar Chanah relating that once when traveling on a boat he saw a large fish upon which a great amount of sand accumulated on its back. He and his fellow travelers thought it was an island and they disembarked from the ship and began to cook and bake on the back of the whale. When it became too hot for the large fish to tolerate the heat, it turned over. Rabbah Bar Channah observed that had the ship not been close by the fish, he and his fellow travelers would have drowned. The Maharsha (ad. loc. s.v. Chazinan) and Rav Soloveitchik’s (Yemei Zikkaron, pp.166-167) explain this tale as a parable regarding the Jewish experience in Galut<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">My analysis of this story may be found at www.parshapages.com/.../Island%20of%20Rabbah%20Bar%20Bar%20Chanah.doc. </i>.",
                    "The comparison of the Jewish people to Yonah might explain the Midrash (Pirkei D’Rabi Eliezer cited by the Radak to Yonah 2:1) that states that the large fish was set aside by Hashem to save Yonah already from the time of the six days of Creation. The Midrash may be understood as teaching that the Jewish People are an integral part of the Creation of the World and therefore Hashem will not permit the nation to self-destruct since the world cannot function without this essential component. This idea is expressed in Yirmiyahu 31:35-36 and 33:25 “If not for My covenant day and night, I would not sustain the heavens and the earth.”",
                    "Accordingly, Yonah’s survival in the large fish has enormous implications for both his time and for eternity. Just as Yonah was indestructible in his Sefer, so too the holy and eternal Jewish nation will not and cannot be destroyed.",
                    "However it is explained, Hashem rescuing Yonah is an expression of Middat HaRachamim. Yonah certainly does not deserve this rescue from a Middat HaDin perspective. This is yet another example of how Hashem is showing Yonah the importance of Middat HaRachamim, which Yonah so roundly rejects in the context of Nineveh. Hashem provides Yonah with an opportunity to experience being the beneficiary of Middat HaRachamim so that he would hopefully be content when it is administered to Nineveh.",
                    "<b>Conclusion</b><br>Hashem creating an extraordinary miracle to save Yonah, however it is explained, is an extraordinary act of kindness performed for a recalcitrant prophet. It brings to mind the story of the Baal Shem Tov who, when asked for advice by a father whose son was abandoning Torah observance, told the father that he should love his son more. When Yonah retreated into stubborn defiance, Hashem loved Yonah more and showed him extra kindness.",
                    "Finally, according to approach number two with Hashem nudging Yonah to mitigate Din with Rachamim, we have a perfect fit with the major theme of Yom Kippur. Hashem saving Yonah is a most fitting expression of the triumph of Rachamim over Din, a chord that resonates most deeply as we approach the end of our judgment period. If Hashem went to such extraordinary lengths to save Yonah despite his rebellion, we plead that He goes to extraordinary lengths to save us as well despite our various respective shortcomings. Throughout Yom Kippur, and even in the Tachanun prayer recited during the weekday morning prayer, we beg Hashem “Lo Al Tzidkoteinu Anachnu Mapilim Tachanunim Lifanecha, Ki Al Rachamecha HaRabim,” “we do not fall begging before You because we are righteous [that we might deserve to have our prayers answered], rather we ask because of Your great mercy (Rachamim).” We hope and pray that if Hashem would place Rachamim over Din and save Yonah, perhaps He may do the same for us."

Nothing, not a ferocious storm or the threat of being cast in the sea, moved Yonah from his stubborn and silent defiance. However, in Perek 2, after three days and three nights in the fish, Yonah finally opens up to Hashem. What prompted Yonah to alter his course and reengage with the Creator?",

                    "Rashi and Mahari Kra cite the Midrash that resolves the contradiction by relating that Yonah first was swallowed by a male fish (Dag). However, Yonah was comfortable and was not prompted to pray. Hashem then caused the male fish to transfer Yonah to a female fish (Dagah). The female fish, in turn, was pregnant and full of many fetuses making it very uncomfortable for Yonah, thereby prompting him to pray to Hashem for his release.",
                    "The Midrash is telling us that severe distress finally motivated Yonah to change. Proof to this assertion may be drawn from Perek 2 Pasuk 3 where Yonah states “Karati MiTzarah Li El Hashem,” “I have called to Hashem out of stress”. Indeed, we find that severe stress sometimes is the only means to reinstate proper perspective on our relationship to Hashem. The Gemara (Megilla 14a) teaches “The removal of this ring [Achashverosh’s signet ring which he gave to Haman] had a greater effect than forty-eight prophets and seven prophetesses, who preached that Israel should better its ways.”",

There he inquired, \"Is the son of Choni the Circle-Drawer still alive?\" The people answered him, \"His son is no more, but his grandson is still living.\" Thereupon he said to them: \"I am Choni the Circle-Drawer,\" but no one would believe him.",

Whereupon he called out, \"I am he!\" But the scholars would not believe him nor did they give him the honor due to him. This hurt him greatly and he prayed for mercy, and he died.

Da’at Mikra in its introduction to Sefer Yonah notes that Ibn Caspi is the only classic authority who cites an opinion that the first two chapters of Sefer Yonah should be understood as having occurred only in a prophetic vision. The Da’at Mikra assumes that the Ibn Caspi refers to the Rambam. Indeed, the Rambam, towards the end of Moreh Nevuchim 2:46, writes “And from what I have mentioned derive to that which I have not mentioned”.",
                    "Professor Uriel Simon vigorously argues that Sefer Yonah is meant to be taken as an allegory similar to the Rambam’s approach to the book of Iyov. He contrasts Yonah with Megillat Esther which he argues has all the hallmarks of an actual story. In Megillat Esther, the name of the king is mentioned, the country in which he rules is noted and a specific timeline is presented for the events presented in the storyline.",
                    "None of these hallmarks of a true story exist in Sefer Yonah. The name of the king is omitted, the kingdom of Assyria (of which Nineveh is the capital city) is not mentioned and no timeline is offered for the events recorded. Moreover, Professor Simon argues that the events are presented in such a wildly unrealistic manner, such as the size of Nineveh being a three days journey long, to stress that the story is not intended to be understood literally.",
                    "<b>The Traditional Approach - Sefer Yonah is a True Story</b><br>Even the more rationally inclined commentators such as Ibn Ezra, Radak and Abarbanel understand all of Sefer Yonah, including the fish episode, as constituting an event that actually happened. Da’at Mikra cites a report printed in a 1927 issue of the Princeton Theological Review which records the saga of a sailor named John Ambrose who allegedly was swallowed by a whale and survived for three days inside the whale.",
                    "Needless to say, many are deeply skeptical about this report. Moreover, Radak and Abarbanel understand Yonah’s survival in the fish as a miraculous event. Thus, a natural explanation is, at best, unnecessary. Just as Hashem made the miracle of Keriat Yam Suf (Splitting the Sea) and the revelation at Har Sinai, so too He made the many miracles recorded in Sefer Yonah.",
                    "Da’at Mikra notes that Chazal also understood the entire Sefer Yonah in a literal sense. The Mishnah (Taanit 2:4) notes that one of the Brachot recited on the seven intense fast days for rain is “Mi Sheana Et Yonah Mimeiei HaDagah Hu Yaaneh Etchem VeYishma BeKol Tzaakatchem HaYom HaZeh, Baruch Atah Hashem, HaOneh BeEt Tzarah,” “the One who answered Yonah from the belly of the fish, will answer you and hear your cries today, blessed are you Hashem Who responds in a time of crisis.”",
                    "We may add that the Rambam himself (Hilchot Taaniot 4:12) codifies this Bracha as normative Halacha. Thus, it is clear that the Rambam believes that the Yonah in the fish episode should be understood literally. The Rambam understands various stories as non-literal due to theological problems posed by the literal understanding. Hashem’s or even an angel’s corporeality is inconceivable to the Rambam and therefore he understands various Pesukim in accordance with this view. However, just as Rambam does not regard the Ten Makkot as allegorical even though it severely deviates from the natural course of events, so too the Rambam does not interpret Yonah in the fish or the Kikayon incident as allegory since there is no compelling theological reason to do so.",
                    "Moreover, the Mishna’s phrase is paraphrased both in the Ashkenazic and Sephardic Selichot. Ashkenazic Jews say “Mi SheAnah LeYonah BeMeiei HaDagah, Hu Yaaneinu” and Sephardic Jews say “DeAnei LeYonah BeMeiei HaDagah, Aneinan”, “He who answered Yonah in the belly of the fish, [He will] answer us”. Thus, the view that Yonah in the fish should be viewed as an allegory lies considerably outside the mainstream of Jewish thought.",
                    "<b>Responding to Professor Simon’s Proofs</b><br>Professor Simon made compelling insights arguing that the literary style indicates that Sefer Yonah is to be understood as allegorical. However, we may respond that the Rambam’s primary proof to his approach is from the fact that the location of Sefer Iyov, the land of Utz, appears to be a fictional location. Sefer Yonah, though, focuses on Nineveh, a very real place. It also mentions Yaffo as a port for international commerce, which it was and remains so until this very day. Tarshish is a real place as well, as explained by Da’at Mikra.",
                    "The portrayal of Nineveh as evil and an exceedingly large city is indeed realistic. Sefer Nachum serves as the sequel to Sefer Yonah predicting the destruction of Nineveh following its reversion to its evil ways after Yonah’s visit. Finally, the absence of any mention of Yonah’s visit to Nineveh in Assyrian historical records hardly constitutes evidence that this event did not take place. Although abundant amounts of ancient Assyrian artifacts and documents are extant, the absence of Yonah’s visit might be explained in numerous ways.",
                    "It could be that Assyrian kings sought to squelch the story since Yonah’s message of morality was incompatible with their agenda. Alternatively, the repentance was so short lived that the Assyrians recorders of history did not find it worth mentioning. Finally, drawing conclusions from the absence of archaeological evidence is an endeavor fraught with danger which has yielded many theories that were subsequently debunked, especially in regards to the Tanach<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For further discussion of this point, see my “Reason to Believe: Rational Explanations of Orthodox Jewish Thought” pages 100-104. </i>.",
                    "<b>Conclusion</b><br>Rav Yaakov Emden is famous for noting in the introduction to his Siddur that the survival of the Jewish people is a miracle greater in magnitude of any miracle recorded in the Tanach. Yonah’s miraculous survival in the fish foreshadows our supernatural survival in the Exile. Just as Hashem has orchestrated our survival throughout the past very difficult two thousand years, so too did Hashem arrange for Yonah to survive three days in the fish. The Jewish experience makes it much easier for us to believe the reality of Yonah’s miraculous survival in the fish. Furthermore, a major theme of Yom Kippur is Hashem’s relationships and interactions with the world. Remembering the miracles performed for Yonah provide a strong reminder that Hashem interacts directly with the world, a fact we would do well to remember on Yom Kippur."

                    "One of most striking features of Yonah’s Tefilah recited while in the big fish is the frequent mention of the Beit HaMikdash. Yonah refers to the Beit HaMikdash (or a Korban he will offer there) no less than three times (Pesukim 5, 8 and 10) in this brief Tefilah that occupies no more than eight Pesukim.",
                    "A focus on the Beit HaMikdash seems quite incongruous considering Yonah’s present imprisonment inside a fish. In such circumstances survival and rescue would appear to be the only thing that would occupy a reasonable person. For example, if someone were, heaven forfend, trapped in a collapsed coal mine, one would focus on rescue and not envisioning a trip to one’s favorite place of worship<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The analogy might be inapt, though, since Yonah knew that Hashem wasn't going to kill him. Because Hashem sent the large fish to save Yonah from downing, Yonah realizes he's in a state of limbo, not living but not dead either. He had to think beyond of the scope of his situation.</i>.",
                    "Da’at Mikra (to Yonah 2:2) writes that a similar Tefilah to that which Yonah uttered was commonly recited by sailors who were near death at sea and saved. These sailors, continues the Da’at Mikra, would come to the Beit HaMikdash and offer Korbanot. According to this approach Yonah tailored this commonly recited Tefilah to his situation, the focus on the Beit HaMikdash is not specific to Yonah but rather to all who are rescued from deep peril and offer a Korban Todah (thanksgiving offering).",
                    "Rav Dr. Meir Levin (Torah.org class number eight on Sefer Yonah) cites the Yerushalmi (Sukkah 5:1) to solve our problem. The Yerushalmi states “Rav Yonah said: Yonah son of Amitai was at pilgrimage to Jerusalem and he entered the rejoicing of water drawing (Simchat Beit HaShoeva) and the Holy Spirit rested upon him”. Rav Dr. Levin concludes “this explanation certainly throws light on Yonah’s repeated reference to ‘your holy temple’ in his prayer from the belly of the fish<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We must also consider that Yonah resided in the Northern Kingdom at a time when its less than excellent kings maintained a barrier to prevent Aliyah LeRegel. Yonah must have had to make an extraordinary effort to defy the government edict. Interestingly, Chazal (Eruvin 96a) depict Yonah’s wife as sharing her husband’s love for the Beit HaMikdash. Chazal record that Yonah’s wife also made Aliyah LeRegel and the Chachamim did not object. It is interesting that of all the wives of Tzadikim, only the wife of Yonah is mentioned as having made Aliyah LeRegel. This certainly fits with our understanding that Yonah harbored a special affinity and love for the Beit HaMikdash. </i>”.",
                    "At Torah Academy we developed four additional approaches to this issue.",
                    "<b>Explanation Number One - The Goal of Yonah’s Resistance</b><br>Torah Academy of Bergen County student Eli Englard suggested that Yonah is focused on the Beit HaMikdash since this is the goal of his resisting Hashem’s command to address Nineveh. Recall Abarbanel’s approach that Yonah desired Nineveh’s demise since Nineveh was the capital of Assyria which had designs on conquering Eretz Yisrael. As such, Yonah’s ultimate goal is to protect the Beit HaMikdash from the threat posed to it by the Assyrians<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Melachim II 16:12-18 for a description of the damage indirectly caused by the Assyrians to the Beit HaMikdash. The Assyrians also likely influenced the evil king Menashe in his defiling of the Temple. </i>.",
                    "According to this approach, already in his Tefilah recited while still in the fish Yonah is resisting Hashem’s anticipated forgiving of Nineveh. This approach is in harmony with Abarbanel and Malbim’s approach to another portion of Yonah’s Tefilah (2:9) which they interpret as a complaint Yonah lodges that Nineveh’s Teshuvah will not be long lasting.",
                    "Yonah might be trying to push his agenda a bit further in the Tefilah. His goal is to convince Hashem to not forgive Nineveh even as Hashem is holding Yonah hostage inside the fish. Yonah is showing how he isn't thinking short term, but rather much longer and broader term with all of Bnai Yisrael and its Dveikut (deep commitment) to Hashem hanging in the balance.",
                    "<b>Explanation Number Two - The Beit HaMikdash as the Ideal of Truth</b><br>Rav Raphi Mandelstam, my respected colleague at Torah Academy of Bergen County, offers an intriguing approach. He argues that the essence of Yonah is his devotion to truth, as indicated by his name Yonah ben Amitai (the root of Amitai is Emet, the truth). Accordingly, although the Beit HaMikdash is extremely meaningful to every Jew, it is even more meaningful to Yonah since it represents the pinnacle of truth.",
                    "The high standards of Taharah (purity), such as observing Taharah to the fourth degree (Revii LeTuma) instead of the usual second degree (Sheini LeTuma) is an example of the lofty ideals attained in the Beit HaMikdash and nowhere else. The perfection of Taharah achieved in the preparation of the Parah Adumah (Red Cow) described in the opening Perakim of Masechet Parah are another example. In the Beit HaMikdash an errant thought about eating or offering a Korban outside the proper time parameters renders the Korban Pigul, disqualifying the offering and carrying a punishment of Karet (a most grievous punishment). Kohanim or animals with blemishes may not be involved in the service (Avodah) in the Beit HaMikdash.",
                    "All this represents a high achievement of Torah ideals and is the type of uncompromised and unvarnished truth to which Yonah ben Amitai aspires<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Aryeh Krischer notes that even with these ideals of truth and purity, a main function of the Beit HaMikdash is to channel Hashem’s mercy to Bnei Yisrael. Thus, even the place Yonah turns to as symbolic of his unwavering position on Din really reflects Hashem’s Rachamim as well. </i>. Thus, we are hardly surprised that of all people Yonah ben Amitai is obsessed with the Beit HaMikdash. In the words of Torah Academy of Bergen County student Max Krantz, the Beit HaMikdash serves as Yonah’s “happy place” to which he retreats in his imagination to mentally escape the severe stress of being trapped inside a fish.",
                    "<b>Explanation Number Three - Yonah as a Representative of Am Yisrael</b><br>Torah Academy of Bergen County Talmid Gilad Ginsberg offers a suggestion based on Rashi’s assertion (Bereishit 15:10 s.v. Et HaTzipor) that the dove (Yonah) symbolizes Am Yisrael. This is a most compelling comparison considering that the dove constitutes the paradigmatic kosher bird (Chullin 61a).",
                    "Gilad further suggests that Yonah trapped in the fish yet at the same time saved by the fish from drowning in the great sea represents the Jewish people saved by the Galut (exile) yet at the same time trapped in the Galut. Thus, just as Yonah is obsessed with the Beit HaMikdash while trapped in the great fish, so too the Jewish People remain obsessed with the Beit HaMikdash even at the darkest moments of the Exile. Indeed, the Beit HaMikdash is a ubiquitous feature of our Tefilot and Zemirot (songs). At a typical Orthodox Jewish wedding at least half of the songs sung mention the Beit HaMikdash.",
                    "The Talmud Bavli does not encompass most of Seder Zeraim since most of the Halachot that appear in this Seder do not apply in the Exile. Nonetheless, the Bavli devotes much attention to Seder Kodashim which focus on Korbanot (sacrifices), despite their not applying in the Exile. In fact, two very large Masechetot, Zevachim and Menachot, reflect the great attention the Babylonian sages devoted to Korbanot despite the fact that they are not offered in the Exile. This is yet another expression of the Jews in exile following the paradigm set by Yonah of continued preoccupation with the Beit HaMikdash.",
                    "In essence the Beit HaMikdash expresses the presence of Hashem among Am Yisrael. Indeed, the paradigm for the Beit HaMikdash is the Pasuk, “VeAsu Li Mikdash VeShachanti BeTocham,” “make for me a Mikdash and I will reside in them” (Shemot 25:8)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is clear from the Rambam (Hilchot Beit HaBechirah 1:1) that this Pasuk refers not only to the Mishkan but also to the Beit HaMikdash. </i>. The words “in them” refer to the Jewish People. By focusing on the Beit HaMikdash even at our lowest ebb, we articulate our firm belief that Hashem will never abandon His people and his presence remains even in the midst of the Galut (Megillah 29a).",
                    "<b>Explanation Number Four - Think Big Even at Lowest Point</b><br>I suggest that Yonah focusing on the Beit HaMikdash from the darkness of the fish sets the Jewish paradigm of thinking “big” even at the most desperate of times. This is most appropriate for a special people whose destiny is to bring Bracha (blessing) to the entire world (Bereishit 12:3).",
                    "Examples of such behavior include (as recounted by Rav Avraham Pam) Jews going to the Nazi gas chambers chanting “Mir Zennen Zei Ibberleben,” “we will outlive them”. This most certainly has happened as the Jewish people today greatly surpass the achievements of the German people in virtually every area of human endeavors. A more mundane example of Jews harboring bold ambitions in difficult times is the bold launching of the extraordinarily successful Israel Aircraft Industry in the early 1950’s at a time when the newly born State of Israel was struggling to find food and housing for many its citizens.",
                    "Yonah sets the model for Jews’ high ambitions despite seemingly impossible obstacles that stand in the way of achieving their dreams. Perhaps this phenomenon explains Yaakov Avinu’s highly improbable, yet successful, bovine venture despite the fact that Lavan had provided him with the lowest quality livestock as his venture capital (Bereishit 30:36 with Rashi). Yaakov’s strategy of peeled streaks placed before the sheep when they drank seems to have no scientific basis and yet, despite the severe handicaps Yaakov Avinu still emerged as an enormous financial success. I suggest the reason for Yaakov Avinu’s success is that when Jews have faith in the most dire of circumstances Hashem often manipulates the situation for us to attain great achievements. It seems that Hashem rewards Jews for harboring high ambitions. After all, the destiny of our people is to achieve high levels of success.",
                    "<b>Conclusion</b><br>Rav Daniel Fridman notes that Yonah’s obsession with the Beit HaMikdash is yet another reason for Chazal incorporating Sefer Yonah into the Yom Kippur services. Yom Kippur is most certainly the grandest day in the Beit HaMikdash having the most extensive and intricate service of the year including the dramatic entry of the Kohen Gadol into the Kodesh HaKodashim (Holy of Holies, the inner sanctum of the Beit HaMikdash). This clearly makes Sefer Yonah, and the pining of Yonah for the Beit HaMikdash, a most perfect fit for this holy day. Although we no longer have the Beit HaMikdash, we can still get a taste of desire to once more have that grandest of services that was Yom Kippur in the Mikdash speedily in our days."

That is what it seems from Pasuk 3, where Yonah proclaims “Karati MiTzarah Li El Hashem Vayaneini,” “I called out in my anguish to Hashem and He answered me”.

They present proof to this approach from Pasuk 2 which states that Yonah called out to Hashem “MiMeei HaDagah,” “from the belly of the fish”. They infer from the fact that the Pasuk does not say that he called “BeMeei HaDagah,” “within the belly of the fish”, that Yonah recited this prayer after he was rescued.",
                    "Ibn Ezra rejects this view, noting that it runs counter to the flow of the Perek, as Yonah’s release is recorded after the Tefilah, which implies that the prayer was said before the release. Moreover, Pasuk 3 states “MiBeten Sheol Shivati,” “from the belly of the grave I reached out to Hashem”, which implies that he called to Hashem from the belly of the fish.

                    "<b>Approach Number Two - Ibn Ezra</b><br>Ibn Ezra, in turn, explains that Yonah is speaking in “prophetic past”. Since Yonah knows through prophecy that he will be released from the fish, he can speak of his release as if it already occurred. The Ibn Ezra cites many other examples in Tanach where a prophesied future event is written in past tense to signify that since it is prophesied it is as if the event already occurred. One example he provides is “Darach Kochav MiYaakov,” “a star has issued from Yaakov” (Bemidbar 24:17) which refers to the Mashiach’s (Messaiah) arrival, an event that to this day we continue to wait for anxiously.",
                    "It is quite ironic, according to this approach, that Yonah is a beneficiary of a prophecy while outside of Israel, since he fled from Israel according to many commentators to free himself from the obligations of a prophet.",
                    "<b>Approach Number Three - Abarbanel</b><br>Abarbanel utilizes a Midrash that identifies Yonah as the lad that Eliyahu HaNavi revived (see Melachim I 17:17-24) to explain our Pasuk. According to Abarbanel, Yonah is saying that just as a child he called out to Hashem and Hashem answered him, Yonah is confident Hashem will answer him now in his current predicament.",
                    "Abarbanel explains the parallel second half of the Pasuk, “MiBeten Sheol Shivati Shamati Koli,” “from the belly of the depths I cried, my voice has been heard”, as not referring to Hashem having already saved Yonah from the belly of the fish (as Rashi understands) but rather that Yonah was saved literally from the grave, as he had been revived from the dead by Eliyahu HaNavi.",
                    "One could question this approach since Yonah was revived as a child due to the merit of Eliyahu HaNavi and Yonah’s mother for providing Eliyahu with shelter. Just because Yonah was revived due to their merit does not necessarily indicate that he will be saved from the large fish, where the merit of Eliyahu HaNavi and Yonah’s mother would seemingly no longer stand in his stead to convince Hashem to release him.",
                    "<b>Approach Number Four - Radak</b><br>Radak explains that Yonah knew he would be saved from the fish even without receiving a prophecy confirming this outcome. By the very fact that he was saved from the raging sea, he knew that he would be saved from the fish. This approach seems to be the most grounded in the text. Yonah states in this prayer that he was saved from the grave (2:3), referring to the very simple watery grave that was awaiting him when he asked to be thrown overboard.",
                    "Similarly, we Jews can bolster our faith in the future redemption based on our miraculous survival until now. Just as Hashem has miraculously sustained us in the Galut, so too we can be fully confident that Hashem will bring about our future redemption in a miraculous manner.",
                    "<b>Approach Number Five - My Suggestion</b><br>I suggest that Yonah created his own positive momentum by visualizing his release even before it took place. One could argue that for this reason we celebrated the first Korban Pesach in Mitzrayim, even though we were not redeemed yet. Before we could be freed we had to visualize and act as if we were already free. Celebrating the Leaving of Mitzrayim (Egypt) before we left generated the positive momentum that enabled us and brought merit upon us to actually leave. Yonah, in turn, merited leaving the fish since he visualized himself freed by Hashem from the fish even before it happened.",
                    "This is reminiscent of the story of Rabi Akiva (Makkot 24) whose vision of Jerusalem once again being filled with Jewish children has been realized in our times to a great extent simply due to his vision. The Gemara relates:",
                    "It happened that Rabban Gamliel, Rabi Elazar ben Azaria, Rabi Yehoshua, and Rabi Akiva went up to Jerusalem. When they reached Mt. Scopus, they tore their garments. When they reached the Temple Mount, they saw a fox emerging from the place of the Holy of Holies. The others started weeping; Rabi Akiva laughed. Said they to him: \"Why are you laughing?\" Said he to them: \"Why are you weeping?\" Said they to him: \"A place [so holy] that it is said of it, 'the stranger that approaches it shall die,' and now foxes traverse it, and we shouldn't weep?\" Said he to them: \"That is why I laugh. For it is written, 'I shall have bear witness for Me faithful witnesses—Uriah the Priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah. Now what is the connection between Uriah and Zechariah? Uriah was [in the time of] the First Temple, and Zechariah was [in the time of] the Second Temple! But the Torah makes Zachariah's prophecy dependent upon Uriah's prophecy. With Uriah, it is written: 'Therefore, because of you, Zion shall be plowed as a field; [Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the Temple Mount like the high places of a forest.] With Zachariah it is written, 'Old men and women shall yet sit in the streets of Jerusalem.' \"As long as Uriah's prophecy had not been fulfilled, I feared that Zechariah's prophecy may not be fulfilled either. But now that Uriah's prophecy has been fulfilled, it is certain that Zechariah's prophecy will be fulfilled.\" With these words they replied to him: \"Akiva, you have consoled us! Akiva, you have consoled us!\" (translation from Chabad.org).",
                    "Rabi Akiva might have learned the power of a positive vision to create a better reality from Yonah’s positive visualization in the depths of the fish. The same confident approach is reflected in the king of Nineveh proclaiming “Mi Yodeia Yashuv, VeNicham HaElokim,” “if one does Tehsuvah, Hashem will relent” (Yonah 3:9 as interpreted by Targum Yonatan ben Uzziel, discussed at length in our chapter devoted to an analysis of this phrase).",

Complete repentance requires us to confront our past, but in order for the process to be successful it must be fueled by optimism and a positive vision of hope in a new and improved relationship with the Ribbono Shel Olam in the future as well.

                    "According to this approach, Yonah in Pasuk 10 is not contrasting himself with the sailors but committing himself to follow their positive example. A distinct advantage of this approach is that, unlike the Metzudat David, it is not casting Yonah as one who engaged in the reprehensible practice of Mitkabeid BeKlon Chaveiro (promoting oneself at the expense of others).

Da’at Mikra understands the Pasuk as referring to all idolaters who will abandon their pledges to Avodah Zarah when they recognize the futility of idol worship. This approach is reminiscent of Rashi to Devarim 11:16 who explains the Torah referring to idolatry as Elohim Acheirim (other gods) “[Gods] that are strangers to those who worship them. The worshipper cries out to it, but it does not answer him; consequently, it becomes to him as a stranger” (translation from Chabad.org).",

He believes that Yonah is simply saying that Hashem should judge the sailors for their actual merits and not just forgive them due to the kindness they just performed. He wants cold, hard Din, whether or not he gained from their good deeds. Yonah is asking that Hashem take the kindness out of the equation so that way the scales do not tip away from all the different Avodah Zarah in which the sailors engaged. Only after ignoring kindness should Hashem factor in their merits.",
                    "According to this approach, those who were loyal to vanities should be judged accordingly rather than with a focus on their Chesed, the kind and proper deeds and beliefs they have adopted.",

Yonah contrasts himself with those who make this foolish mistake by stating in Pasuk 10 that he will devote time granted to him after his rescue from the fish to worthwhile endeavors such as bringing a Korban Todah in the Beit haMikdash. In other words, Yonah pledges to devote his life to useful projects.",
                    "Torah Academy of Bergen County student Avi Baer cogently asks on this approach - didn’t we find Yonah eager to die in Perek 1? How, then, can we explain Yonah as pledging to use his time well in Yonah 2:10? One may answer that this is precisely the point. Yonah in Perek 2 is retracting the desire to die that he expressed in Perek 1 (although he reverts to this desire in Perek 4). Yonah may be understood as saying that although he wished to die in Perek 1, he is no longer adopting this course. Rather he is eager to live, greatly valuing his life and the time Hashem has, in His kindness, granted. According to this approach, Yonah in Perek 2 has transformed and reoriented himself, and thereby performed a significant act of Teshuvah, while still in the belly of the fish<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One may wonder why Yonah uses such vague language in Pasuk 9.

                    "In the beginning of Perek 2 we find Yonah imprisoned inside the big fish<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On the one hand the fish saved Yonah’s life. On the other hand, Yonah’s time inside the fish is a time of enforced confinement. This is similar to the city of refuge to where a careless killer runs. The Mishna in the second chapter of Makkot refers to these cities as Arei Miklat (cities of refuge) since it rescues the killer from the victim’s relative who would avenge the bloodshed (Goeil HaDam). The Gemara in the second chapter of Makkot, though, refers to these cities as Galut (exile). These cities, similar to Yonah’s fish, serve two purposes. It both saves the life of the sinner but also serves as a prison as punishment for the sin committed. </i>. At the end of the Perek we find Yonah released. The confinement makes sense as a punishment for Yonah’s ongoing defiance of Hashem. The release, though, does not make sense. In the Tanach, redemption is triggered by Teshuvah. Where is the evidence that Yonah repented in this Perek?",
                    "<b>The Missing Teshuvah</b><br>The Rambam in both the first and second Perakim of Hilchot Teshuvah sets forth the accepted process for repentance. There are three basic components – Vidui (confession), Charatah (regretting the sin), and Kabalah Al HeAtid (resolving never to repeat the violation). A careful inspection of Perek 2 does not reveal even a trace of Yonah having undergone any of these steps. All he does is pray for his release. Nonetheless, Hashem releases Yonah from the fish despite Yonah’s failure to make any movement towards Teshuvah! Where is the justice and what is the logic in Hashem’s actions?",
                    "<b>Abarbanel, Malbim, and Radak - Uncovering Yonah’s Teshuvah</b><br>Some of the commentaries endeavor to discover Yonah’s actions of repentance. Abarbanel and Malbim view Pasuk 10 where Yonah states “That which I promised I will fulfill” as his commitment to fulfill his obligation to address Nineveh. The concluding two words of this Pasuk (2:10) “Yeshuata LaHashem,” “salvation stems from Hashem”, refers to Yonah’s resolving to no longer try to interfere in the historical process and leave that to Hashem (which according to Abarbanel and Malbim was Yonah’s motivation to disobey Hashem in the first place). Thus, according to Abarbanel and Malbim, Yonah has resolved not to repeat his sin and has (at least indirectly) confessed his sin.",
                    "While this is a creative reading of Pasuk, the straightforward reading of the Pasuk (as presented in the Da’at Mikra) is that it is referring to Yonah pledging to honor his commitment to offer a Korban Todah subsequent to his release from the fish.",

Thus, according to Radak, Yonah has acknowledged his sin and accepts its consequence as fair.",

We put forth three proofs to this understanding. First, Yonah never explicitly engages in any of the three crucial components of the Teshuvah process.",
                    "Second, Pasuk 11 describes Yonah as being “Vayakei,” “regurgitated”, from the fish. This hardly constitutes a compliment. It is reminiscent of Vayikra 18:28 where Hashem warns us not to pollute the land with violations of Arayot “VeLo Taki HaAretz Etchem,” “lest the land vomit you [Bnei Yisrael] out [as it vomited its prior inhabitants]”.",
                    "Rashi thereupon famously comments (based on the Torat Kohanim 20:123) “This can be compared to a prince who was fed obnoxious food, which could not stay in his intestines; so he vomited it out. Likewise, the Land of Israel cannot retain transgressors [and thus, it vomits them out<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">67</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Translation from Chabad.org</i>]”. Thus, regurgitation in the Tanach is associated with sinners. Accordingly, Yonah remains a sinner even after his release from the fish at the end of Perek 2.",
                    "Our third proof is that Sefer Yonah continues two more Perakim after Perek 2 concludes and Yonah’s struggle with Hashem continues full force. Had Yonah repented in Perek 2, the Sefer would have ended there. The fact that it continues clearly shows that Yonah had yet to internalize and make peace with Hashem’s agenda and methodology in dealing with Nineveh.",
                    "<b>Why Hashem Releases Yonah from the Fish</b><br>If Yonah did not repent, one rightfully asks why then did Hashem respond to Yonah’s Tefilah and release him from the fish. We suggest that although Yonah did not repent in Perek 2, he does correct a major mistake.",
                    "In Perek 1 Yonah shuts down entirely and refuses to engage in dialogue with Hashem. Yonah wants nothing to do with Hashem and however Hashem seeks to engage Yonah, Yonah rejects the overture. In Perek 2, however, Yonah once again reengages with Hashem. This is why Yonah’s Tefilah in Perek 2 repeatedly refers to Hashem as Elokav (2:2) or Elokai<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">What should bring up some insight on Yonah’s personality, is that he uses “Elokav” which is Hashem’s name of Din. Yonah still sees Hashem as an actuator of Din and nothing more, even when dealing with his own punishment. We will see a shift in Yonah’s thinking only when we reach the Kikayon episode, two Perakim later. In the meantime, “Elokav” and “Elokei” adds to the point that Yonah did not do Teshuvah and is still feeling the same way about Hashem while in the big fish. Nevertheless he is approaching the situation in a more constructive manner than he had while aboard the ship heading to Tarshish.</i> (2:7). Both of those words are in the Hebrew possessive and thus Yonah is identifying Hashem as his God. Yonah has returned to Hashem and is once again willing to engage in dialogue.",
                    "Aryeh Krischer adds that Yonah is locked in the belly of the fish, symbolically removed completely from the world. He is beneath the waves, inside an animal. No other part of the world has any hope of contacting Yonah. Thus it is the perfect “measure for measure”: Yonah sought to sever contact with the Master of the World, as so his contact with the world was severed. (Leaving open only the option to contact the Master.)",
                    "Although Yonah did not repent, Hashem felt there was hope for Yonah to eventually repent since at least Yonah is now willing to conduct a conversation with Hashem, which Yonah does again vigorously in Perek 4<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Alternatively, Hashem understood from Yonah’s Tefilah that he had a shift in approach and will now do what Hashem wants, however begrudgingly. Thus, there was no longer a need to keep Yonah in the fish. Keeping Yonah there any longer would not have brought Nineveh the Nevuah they needed, especially seeing as how effective Yonah ultimately was for them. Yonah was let out, not because of Teshuvah, but because of his approach towards Hashem and his mission. The difference between this answer and the answer we suggested in the body of our article, is that our article’s approach focuses on the conversation between Yonah and Hashem while the alternative looks at the actions Yonah is now willing to take.</i>. This is comparable to an estranged couple<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Recall that the relationship between Hashem and the Jews is compared to a husband-wife relationship in Shir HaShirim, Hoshea, and many other places in Tanach and Chazal. </i> where one member refuses to talk to his or her partner. In such a situation, there is no hope for redemption. However, once a conversation begins, possibilities emerge. Similarly, if a student has totally shut down there is no hope for his performance in his learning to improve. However, once he emerges from his withdrawal, potential for improvement exists and his Rebbe will be thrilled that the student has “returned” from his self-imposed “exile”.",
                    "<b>Conclusion</b><br>Yonah, strictly speaking, does not deserve to be released from the fish since he did not repent. However, Hashem once again exercises his Middat HaRachamim with Yonah and lets him free simply due to Yonah engaging in dialogue. Hashem is eager for Yonah to repent and hopes that by once again showering him with His mercy that Yonah will be convinced of the cogency of Middat HaRachamim in regards to Nineveh. Hashem’s actions toward Yonah once again show Hashem’s Middat HaRachamim and remind us that even on Yom Kippur, the day of Din, Hashem is open and eager for us to return to Him and His ways. Yonah teaches us that even when our actions are not perfectly aligned with the Teshuvah process Hashem is willing to accept us as long as we show steps in the right direction."

Perhaps completing only one third of the mission is an indication of passive aggressive behavior on the part of Yonah. Perhaps Yonah is trying to sabotage his mission in the hope that Nineveh will not repent. This latter option might be the reason why Yonah did not attempt to gain an audience with the king. Of course, the plan backfired since the word of Yonah spread like wildfire and impacted the entire city, despite Yonah not making a full effort to succeed.",

We may learn from this that in our own lives trying to thwart Hashem is hopelessly futile and we may as well try to follow His will, since nothing else can hope to succeed. On the other hand, the complement to this lesson we see from Nineveh’s response: once we take even small steps toward fulfilling Hashem’s mission our success has the potential to blossom and spread far faster than we would have dreamed. The work of three days can be done in one. What powerful ideas to have on the Day of Judgement!

He offers the possibility that Yonah omitted the option of Teshuvah since he was eager for Nineveh not to perform Teshuvah. Yonah wanted to avoid coming at all, but truncating his message was the best he was going to get.",
                    "Yonah’s omission of the Teshuvah option is an example of what is stated in Mishlei (19:21) “Rabot Machashavot BeLev Ish VaAtzat Hashem Hi Takum,” “while there are many thoughts in man’s heart, Hashem’s plan will ultimately prevail.” Indeed, Moshe Rabbeinu states (Bemidbar 14:41) “Lamah Zeh Atem Overim Et Pi Hashem VeHi Lo Titzlach,” “why are you violating the word of Hashem, as your efforts will not succeed.” Hoshea (14:2) also teaches “Shuvah Ad Hashem Elokecha, Ki Chashalta BaAvonecha,” “return to God since you have failed in your sins.”",
                    "<b>Rashi vs. the Ibn Ezra</b><br>Rashi presents a most interesting approach which develops the idea that Teshuvah is implicit in Yonah’s five word speech to Nineveh. Rashi notes that the word “Nehepachet,” “overturned”, may be understood in one of two ways. Either it means “destroyed”, as the word is used in the context of the destruction of Sedom. Alternatively, it could mean that Nineveh will “turn over”, as in the phrase “turn over a new leaf” or a complete reversal of behavior as in the phrase “VeNahaphoch Hu,” “and it was completely reversed” from Megillat Esther (9:1).",
                    "In other words, by using the word “Nehepachet”, Yonah communicates to Nineveh that they have the opportunity to create their own destiny.

                    "Torah Academy students note the power of Rashi’s approach as it provides the people of Nineveh with a choice. This is similar to the sailors offering Yonah a choice (Yonah 1:11), saying to him “what should we do to you?” As mentioned previously, when one provides a choice one greatly increases the possibility one’s listeners “buy in”.",

This would be an example of the Lubavitcher Rebbeet motto “Tracht Gut Vet Zein Gut,” “think good it will be good”.

In the Bible, Moses is on the mountain for forty days and emerges as a man reborn with a radiant face. The spies enter the land as princes and forty days later return with the self-image of grasshoppers. The Israelite nation spends forty years in the desert and is transformed from a fractured nation of refugees into a unified nation of conquerors…..In rabbinic literature, there are forty minus one categories of prohibited (creative) work on Shabbat, a child is considered to be “alive” in the womb after forty days, and pregnancy lasts for forty weeks.",

                    "The compelling research findings concerning long-term and deeply held values led Gladwell to the conclusion that cultural legacies are powerful forces. They have deep roots and long lives. They persist, generation after generation, virtually intact, even as the economic and social demographic conditions that spawned them have vanished, and they play such a role in directing attitudes and behavior that we cannot make sense of our world without them.",
                    "The Torah is clearly in harmony with Gladwell’s perspective on cultural legacies. For example, the Torah (Devarim 23:4-5) forbids us to marry a Moabite or Ammonite due to their failure to offer us food as we passed near their land. One could ask why later generations are given a consequence for the mistake of an earlier generation.",

The failure of Ammon and Moav to act decently and offer food to the Jews traveling through the area demonstrates that they are the cultural heirs to the evil legacy of Sedom and Lot’s wife. Sedom’s primary sin was their refusal to show kindness to outsiders (Yechezkeil 16:49) and Lot’s wife was thoroughly infected with this sick attitude (Rashi to Bereishit 19:26 s.v. VaTehi, citing Bereishit Rabbah 50:4).",

Torah Academy of Bergen County students suggest that the reason Nineveh readily reverted to their original path of sin is because the Assyrian culture was permeated with cruelty. This cultural legacy is difficult to overcome and indeed the people of Nineveh succumbed to its immense power.",

Discovering the reasons for Nineveh’s lack of success helps, especially as we reach the zenith of Yom Kippur, chart a proper plan of spiritual growth that is both effective in the short run and sustainable in the long term. We must also take care to identify the cultural legacies that permeate our lives and take steps to combat those that do not jive with the life we wish to live while strengthening those that keep us on the right path."

After all, there are many instances of people who both serve Hashem and worship Avodah Zarah.

When there is no accountability, chaos inevitably emerges where might makes right and all sense of justice is lost. Avodah Zarah is synonymous with moral relativism. When there is more than one God there is more than one standard of morality. Moral relativism opens the floodgates to all kinds of horrific behavior, since there is no universal authority to enforce one uniform moral code. Absent one belief in one God, morality becomes a free for all and the gates to immorality of open.

A balance between Chesed (kindness) and Emet (truth) must be struck in order for the world to function properly.

This certainly appears to apply to Nineveh and the Assyrians. The reader eagerly anticipates hearing how Hashem will explain the logic of his forgiving Nineveh without having corrected the sin of Avodah Zarah and then see how we may seek for Hashem to apply that Chesed towards ourselves.

Even when we succeed some part of us constantly looks back waiting for the other shoe to drop. Yonah sitting outside Nineveh brings to mind the subconscious “sitting outside” we may do to ourselves (or, far worse, to others), waiting for the Teshuvah of Yom Kippur to fade. Hearing of this incident reminds us at the height of Teshuvah that, although we must be vigilant to guard our success, excessive focus on our (and others’) actions before we repented and expecting ourselves to fall back into old habits will ultimately backfire. Yonah did not accept that Nineveh’s slate had been wiped clean. It behooves us to recognize this error and correct it in ourselves before Yom Kippur ends. On the Day of Judgement we beg Hashem for forgiveness, and we must recognize that once forgiveness is granted we truly are forgiven."

He makes this assertion twice: once when he reveals his identity to his brothers and yet again when consoling his brothers after their father Jacob’s death. We are perplexed, though, as to how Yosef became convinced that this indeed was Hashem's intention. After all, unlike the Patriarchs, Yosef never received a direct prophecy from Hashem, so how was he privy to God's will?",

For if Yosef can discern God's will without the benefit of direct communication, then we also might be able to discover Hashem's will even in an age devoid of prophecy (or even the Bat Kol (heavenly voice), the lower degree of prophecy that was sometimes heard in Talmudic times).",
                    "An answer to our query emerges from an analysis of an intriguing comment made by Rashi. The Torah records that the caravan that transported Yosef to slavery in Egypt was carrying fragrant spices such as balsam and lotus.

                    "This teaching is quite puzzling. Yosef is being transported to Egypt to live a miserable existence as a slave. Yosef’s privileged life as Jacob’s favorite son was transformed instantly to a wretched reality. How would Hashem’s arranging for the caravan to carry sweet smells help Yosef in any significant manner? Odoriferous cargo would have appeared to constitute the least of Yosef’s newly-encountered problems. The situation would seem analogous to someone who, God forbid, was kidnapped by ISIS and Hashem arranged for the vehicle transporting the victim to be pleasant-smelling.

Yosef did not need a divine revelation to ascertain this information; he needed only a sense of logic and sensitivity to his surroundings to become conscious of Hashem’s involvement. The ongoing and eventually dramatic turn of events during Yosef’s time in Mitzrayim (Egypt) encouraged the same train of thought and led Yosef to detect and identify Hashem’s continued support and intervention.",

Yosef saw Hashem’s direct intervention and took it for good, saving his family and the whole region. In doing so, following Hashem’s intervention and using it to execute Hashem’s will, Yosef succeeded mightily. Yonah did the opposite, he took Hashem’s intervention and used it to directly oppose Hashem’s will, believing himself correct and Hashem wrong. The result: Yonah falls hard.

Hashem might be trying to console Yonah by hinting that he did the right thing but in the wrong way. Yonah was trying to just brute-force his way to justice. Hashem was explaining that you have to give people a chance and if they don't take it, they fall even harder. Yonah did not take the message to heart, wanting to still believe in pure Din (using a psychological term: cognitive dissonance which means the mind is incapable of changing its beliefs because they would not match the body’s actions, causing internal debate and struggle).</i>” Aryeh Krischer adds that Hashem may be trying to convince Yonah by employing the Golden Rule (as attributed to Hillel by the Gemara Shabbat 31a) – What is hateful unto you, do not do unto others. Perhaps Hashem hopes that by providing Yonah with joy and comfort through Middat HaRachamim followed by intense pain through Middat HaDin Yonah will realize that it is “hateful unto him” to bear the brunt of Middat HaDin.

                    "In explaining why He forgave Nineveh, Hashem tells Yonah that the city’s many inhabitants do not know between right and left (Yonah 4:11). Presumably this means they do not distinguish between right and wrong.",
                    "This is an enormously difficult assertion. After all, every human being is created in the image of Hashem and is thus capable of recognizing the difference between right and wrong, no matter the environment in which he was raised.",
                    "<b>Approach Number One - Rashi, Radak, and Metzudat David</b><br>One approach that many of the Mepharshim find attractive is the idea that Hashem is referring to the children of Nineveh regarding whom one may say they do not distinguish between right and wrong. According to this approach, Hashem spared Nineveh due to its innocent children.",
                    "Professor Uriel Simon presents intriguing support to this approach. He notes that archaeological discoveries indicate that the population of Nineveh hovered around 300,000. This, of course, is far more than the population of 120,000 people mentioned in Yonah 4:11. Professor Simon suggests that the 120,000 refers to those residents who are innocent, namely the children.",
                    "My Talmidim at Torah Academy of Bergen County did not find this argument compelling since the children were unlikely to compose such a large component of Nineveh’s population. This is especially true according to the Minchat Chinuch’s (190:8) suggestion that a non-Jew is regarded as a minor only until approximately age nine when he has attained a level of sufficient understanding. Torah Academy of Bergen County Talmid Max Schechter smartly suggests that 120,000 was the number of Nineveh residents who remained in the city even after Yonah issued his warning of imminent destruction.",
                    "Alternatively, it could be like our counts in Sefer Bemidbar. Only the men between ages of twenty and sixty are counted. Thus we can double the number of 120,000 to account for women and add another fifty percent for those under the age of twenty to give us the 300,000 count.

He notes that Hashem did not spare Sedom or the Dor HaMabul (Generation of the Flood) from destruction despite the children in their midst. The same applies to the destruction of Nineveh described in Sefer Nachum. Rather, we conclude from these instances, writes the Abarbanel, that children suffer the consequences created by the evil perpetrated by the adults in their environment. Interestingly, this might serve as a justification for the American dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, despite the many infants and children who sadly perished in these attacks.",
                    "We may add that in the case of Sedom, Avraham Avinu seeks only for there to be ten righteous and moral people, not innocent individuals. Assuming that Nineveh’s teachings were immoral, all children were tainted and so, though innocent, were not sufficient to save the city. Thus, just like the animals of the Dor HaMabul, they too were brought down with the punishment.",
                    "<b>Approach Number Two - Abarbanel</b><br>The Abarbanel adopts an approach consistent with his understanding that Yonah is upset that Hashem forgave Nineveh despite the fact that the inhabitants did not abandon the worship of idolatry. According to Abarbanel, Hashem explains that in regard to the sin of Avodah Zarah he regards the people of Ninveh as not being able to distinguish between right and left. Nineveh’s residents, adults and children alike, are the equivalent of a Tinok SheNishbah, a Jewish baby captured and raised by non-Jews who does not know better than to worship idols.",
                    "The Rambam (Hilchot Mamrim 3:1-3), when he codifies the harsh actions that the Halachah prescribes for a known Apikores (someone who rejects one of the pillars of traditional Jewish thought), limits their application as follows:",

However, children and grandchildren of those who go astray... who were born to Karaites and were raised with these tenets, such a person is like a Tinok SheNishbah... He is like one who was coerced [to violate mitzvot]. Although he heard as an adult that he is Jewish and saw practicing traditional Jews, he is still like one who is coerced, since he was raised on mistaken beliefs. It is therefore appropriate to try to influence them to return to traditional Jewish observance and beliefs and draw them with pleasant engagement until they return to a Torah life.",
                    "Yonah 4:11 just might serve as the Biblical basis for the Rambam’s assertion. The powerful cultural legacy of idolatry in the ancient near east and the lack of appropriate spiritual guidance in the region make it reasonable for one to classify the people of Nineveh as Tinokot SheNishbu.",
                    "Despite the idea of Tinok SheNishbah as a reason for compassion and innocence, some criticize the idea as literally infantilizing evil doers. These critics argue that such categorization is disrespectful to those who hold errant beliefs. A response to these critics is that indeed the Tinok SheNishbah approach, while it allows for leniency, is not a complimentary appellation. If the misled individual were to be thinking as an adult he would not worship idols or engage in other errant activities or harbor wayward beliefs. Indeed, Hashem compares those who are regarded as Tinok SheNishba to animals who do not know better. Animals do not think and simply follow their instincts. A Tinok SheNishba, while forgivable for his errors, is nonetheless comparable to a brute animal since he proceeds through life just following the herd and failing to think for himself. In contrast, Avraham Avinu and those who follow his path of thoughtful self-determination are the true adults.",
                    "<b>The Limitation of the Tinok SheNishbah Rule</b><br>One may wonder, accordingly, why Hashem destroyed Sedom and the Dor HaMabul. Why did Hashem not regard these communities as Tinok Shenishbah?

Every human being is able and responsible to realize that theft is wrong even if the ambient culture regards it as acceptable.",
                    "It is for this reason that the Torah (Bereishit 6:13) specifically mentions “Chamas,” “theft,” as the reason for the Mabul.

Moreover, it is specifically the evil of Chamas that is mentioned in Yonah 3:8 that the people of Nineveh and its leadership corrected.",
                    "According to Abarbanel, Yonah wondered why Hashem accepted the Teshuvah of Nineveh when they repented only for Geneivah but not for Avodah Zarah. Based on Ramban we can answer that regarding Geneivah, the idea of Tinok SheNishbah does not serve as an excuse. Regarding Avodah Zarah, Tinok SheNishba does deem a community as worthy of forgiveness since its mistakenness and inherent evil are not as apparent as that of theft or murder<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">106</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The distinction might come from the fact that Avodah Zarah is said (see the first chapter of the Rambam’s Hilchot Avodah Zarah) to have started as a method of worshipping Hashem and so it is not as inherently evil as murder or theft.</i>.",
                    "Similarly, the straw that broke the camel’s back regarding Sedom was that when they discovered that a young girl had fed a starving beggar, they smeared honey all over her and placed her upon the city wall, so that she died<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">107</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The fact that on a technical level Halacha would classify this as an act of Grama, indirect causation excused from an earthly court’s capital punishment, does not detract one bit from the severity of this hideous act.

Why didn’t Hashem classify the Jews as Tinokot SheNishbu regarding this sin as Hashem did regarding Nineveh? The Abarbanel answers that the presence of Neviim and other proper spiritual guides precludes this possibility.

Thus, Yonah expressed the will of Hashem that saw Yarovam ben Yoash as forgivable, which seems to indicate that Yonah had internalized the message communicated to him by Hashem at the conclusion of Yonah Perek 4.
