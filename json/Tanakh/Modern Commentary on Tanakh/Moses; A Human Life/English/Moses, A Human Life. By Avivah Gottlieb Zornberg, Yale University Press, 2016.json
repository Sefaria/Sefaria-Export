        "Acknowledgments": [
            "Writing this book has been a return, with a difference, to a subject that has always fascinated me. In the context of the larger biblical narrative, Moses as both “man of God” and, simply, as “the man Moses” has been with me throughout my teaching and my writing life. The difference in approaching this project is the challenge of confronting the “biographical” dimension of the subject. A “life of Moses” is, in the usual sense, impossible. Moses looms too large in traditional Jewish thought, veering often toward the allegorical, the irreducibly Other. Writing a “human life” of this unknowable figure seemed to brush against the impossible.",
            "I therefore owe a special debt of gratitude to Steven Zipperstein for inviting me to participate in the Yale University Press series of Jewish Lives and, more importantly, for persisting in his invitation in the face of my hesitations. His warm support of my unusual approach to biography made it possible for me to conceive of this book. Anita Shapira added her voice in encouraging me to write about Moses. As coeditors of the series and outstanding scholars, Steven and Anita honored me with their openness to my work.",
            "I am grateful, too, to the many friends and students in Jerusalem and abroad who expressed interest and shared ideas as I was moving ahead with the writing. I want to single out Betsy Rosenberg for her deep readings of the chapters as they emerged—in fine exchange, she offered me her newborn poems; and my agent, Sharon Friedman, whose vivid intelligence mirrored my work back to me. I also want to acknowledge the patient and expert guidance of Ileene Smith and the editorial department at Yale University Press. In particular, I am grateful to Paul Betz for his careful copyediting. And, as always, I want to thank my good friends, Adele and Ron Tauber, for their warm hospitality during my lecture tours in the United States: they have given me a hub for my many flights across the American continent. In Jerusalem, the Matan Institute, the Israel Centre, and Beit Avi Chai have hosted my lectures; while the London School of Jewish Studies has graciously invited me, year after year, to address its students. These lectures and the connection they offered with varied audiences have stimulated my thinking on Moses the man.",
            "Above all, I am grateful to my husband, Eric, for his daily presence in my life. Through his constant loving companionship (not to speak of his inspired cooking) he gives me time and space to absorb myself in learning, teaching, and writing. Eric and our children, Bracha, Yarden, and Avi, together with their partners, Paul, Yael, and Tali, and their children, Miriam, Aluma, Zohar, Shuvi, Yasmine, and Amir, form an abundant world; they each bring their vitality, wit, and beauty to bless my life."

        "Introduction": [
            "I once took part in a bibliodrama workshop at a Jewish Theological Seminary rabbinical retreat. In the morning I taught Bible and rabbinics, and in the evening I joined my students for the workshop. We were asked to enter the role of a biblical character, and I chose to portray Moses in the scene where he beseeches God to allow him to cross over the river Jordan and enter the Holy Land. As I began to speak <i>as Moses</i>, I found myself weeping. I couldn’t help wondering why the use of the first-­ person form had stirred such unsuspected depths of pain. Who was speaking? <i>I as Moses</i> turned out to be a volatile combination.",
            "The pathos of Moses’ plight had always been with me in my teaching, but never so profoundly . . . By switching to the first person, I had released a flood of grief.",
            "In a sense, I was allowing myself—my <i>I</i>—to be read by the text. I was undergoing a harrowing transpersonal experience: exposing myself to the gaze or hearing of the text. Moses’ words were interspersed with mine; in their otherness, they were also somehow mine.",
            "In this study of Moses, my <i>I</i> is both absent and present. However chastely I avoid using the first person, an implicit <i>I</i> has chosen, for example, to shine a light on W. G. Sebald’s Austerlitz, by way of illuminating the figure of Moses, who lived millennia before him (see chap. 1). I have allowed Austerlitz to speak for Moses.",
            "This <i>I</i> seeks light where it can be found, even in the dark places of modern Jewish destiny. This <i>I</i> is affected by intimate affinities with aspects of Moses’ experience. There is a seepage between author and subject that runs both ways. In writing about Moses, I bring myself to bear on my subject. But conversely, in bringing myself to bear, I am affected by the singular presence of my subject. Alchemically, a third presence is created in the space between myself and my subject.",
            "The psychoanalyst Thomas Ogden has eloquently described the intimate experience of reading as a meeting of voices:",
            "<small>A third subject is created in the experience of reading that is not reducible to either writer or reader. The creation of a third subject (that exists in tension with the writer and the reader as separate subjects) is the essence of the experience of reading.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thomas H. Ogden, <i>Subjects of Analysis</i> (Northvale, NJ: Jason Aronson Inc., 1994), 1–2.</i></small>",
            "This third subject is <i>I-yet-not-I</i>. Even as we speak, or read, or write, we are spoken; by history, by our own unconscious life, by the one to whom we think we speak. The encounter with another inflects my own voice. The otherness of a text, or of my own <i>I-ness</i>, both disturbs and seduces me. Across a threshold of susceptibility, I am touched, I undergo something that comes from the outside but evokes a profound inwardness.",
            "* * *",
            "A biography of Moses is different from conventional biographies in that, perhaps uniquely, its source material is contained in one main text, the biblical text. But while reading this text remains a creative and even unpredictable endeavor, as I have suggested, the biographical challenge is immeasurably enriched by the existence of the “supplementary” material found in midrashic texts.",
            "These texts, compiled mainly in Palestine from the third to the tenth centuries, are amplifications of the biblical narratives. Gaps are intuited, turbulences are palpated. Based on ancient reading traditions, midrash arises out of the discussions and disagreements of the House of Study; it often takes its origin in homiletical oral presentations to the community. It carries authentic, even inevitable resonances of the biblical words. I have tried to attend to these resonances, particularly in relation to what they evoke about Moses’ inner world, about the ways he is touched by history, by God’s call, and by his own quest.",
            "The inner world of Moses emerges into higher relief in the final phase of his life. For it is in the last months of his life that he describes to his people, in the first person, their shared experience in the wilderness. At the heart of his apparently neutral account of experiences and divine communications already narrated, for the most part, in the third person, are moments of almost uncanny personal intensity—notably, Moses’ account in Deuteronomy 3 of his entreaty to God to allow him to cross over to the Promised Land. Moses relates to the people a moment when God refused to listen to him. This story, like a cry of unassuaged anguish, stands out from the chronicles of conquest in which it is embedded.",
            "In the first person, Moses testifies to an unbearable encounter with God’s otherness. He transmits this testimony to his people; without his words, they—and we—would not know of it: “And I beseeched God at that time . . . and God would not listen to me: ‘Enough! Never speak to Me again of this thing!’” (Deut. 3:23, 25, 26).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">All translations from biblical texts are by the author.</i>",
            "Here, Moses’ <i>I</i> emerges at its most vulnerable—and is silenced. How do we read this? We too are wounded and silenced. This short narrative, this small disturbance in the chronicle, bears a trace of Moses’ essential being. In it is held Moses’ singularity, his truth. It stands out, conveying his unique sensibility.",
            "The midrashic sages offer an oblique reading that sensitizes us to this moment of rupture; they hear its resonance at other moments in Moses’ final speeches. They hear Moses’ singular voice, his <i>I</i> narrating to his people a private moment of their shared past.",
            "In these midrashic passages, Moses expresses his sense of abandonment <i>by them</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Deut. Rabba 3:12 and 7:11.</i> He reproaches them for their failure to bring him with them into the Holy Land. Their empathy, their prayers might have moved God to relent. An entirely—even shockingly—human Moses stands revealed here. Speaking in his own voice, not to God but to his people, he grieves their lack of attentiveness to him.",
            "A new field of encounter opens between them, where the Israelites are called on, as human beings, to respond to Moses’ human singularity. If they had had eyes, and ears, and a heart for him, they might have tipped the balance of his fate.",
            "What is striking about such midrashic narratives is the respect that they pay to Moses’ “undignified” self-presentation. Resentment, anger, complaint—these play a role in his final addresses to the people. Rather than speaking with the impersonal authority of the messenger, he lets himself be heard speaking from that threshold of susceptibility that precedes thoughtfulness. In the poignant voice of autobiography, he emerges, and pierces us.",
            "This voice, amplified in the midrash, communicates Moses’ aloneness, his unknownness. Paradoxically, Moses has always been largely unknown to his people, and to us, his readers. But the sense of his opaqueness, of his hidden life, is precisely what gives him verisimilitude. An inscrutable subjectivity haunts the book of Deuteronomy, which is, in the Talmudic expression, <i>his book</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">B. Baba Batra: “Moses wrote the story of Balaam, the book of Job, and his book.”</i> The biblical portrait of this singular figure is, of necessity, incomplete. If only because of his periods of unrecorded encounter with God, the man Moses remains enigmatic, as though he holds a secret.",
            "The Sages of the midrash add lights and shadows to his portrait but, in a sense, only deepen its mystery. He resists our full understanding and therefore seems real. The biographical desire—to know him fully—constantly brushes against its own impossibility.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Alexander Nehamas, <i>The Art of Living</i> (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1998), 91–92, for a discussion of a similar motif in Plato’s account of Socrates.</i>",
            "I have tried to attend to these midrashic readings of Moses’ unique being. Largely, he remains in shadow, and from these shadows his reality emerges. In this “Life of Moses,” I am compelled to complete the biblical act of creation: to trace Moses’ birth into a world of genocide, his infancy with two mothers, his youth as an Egyptian prince, his calling by God into a life in which he is to speak for God to the Israelites and for the Israelites to God.",
            "This messenger, it transpires, cannot speak; or at least this is his own self-description: “I am not a man of words. . . . I am heavy of mouth and heavy of tongue . . . of uncircumcised lips.” Mouth, tongue, and lips become the partial objects, the organs that hold the place of his singularity. His first response to God’s call is a dual one: “Here I am!” . . . “Who am I?” (Ex. 3:4, 11). His unique life is lived in excess of any specific identity. In some sense, at least at the outset, he is prelingual and thus poignantly susceptible to the impressions of a violent world.",
            "In this early state, he lives in a kind of suspended animation. Bearer of a traumatic history, he comes to enact the unconscious history of his people. Here is another paradox: at his most singular, in his speechlessness, in his unknownness, Moses functions as a living metaphor for a people in exile from itself. Or perhaps, more accurately, we may say that he exists in a metonymic relation to the people who are, at first, both his and not his. He is associated with them and comes to represent them at certain junctures of their experience.",
            "From the kabbalistic perspective, Moses’ speechlessness is viewed as a case in point of a more general malaise; the <i>galut ha-dibbur</i>, the “exile of the word,” which is the condition of <i>Mitzrayim</i>—Hebrew for Egypt—with its harmonics of <i>tzara</i> (constriction, trouble), <i>meitzar</i> (narrow straits), <i>tzirim</i> (birth contractions). On all levels, from the metaphysical to the brutally physical, the Israelites must be redeemed from a death grip that chokes their expressive life. <i>Yetziat Mitzrayim</i>—the <i>exodus</i> from Egypt—comes to mean an impossible but essential birth from anguish.",
            "The gates of Egypt are opened, but this redemption comes only <i>b’chipazon</i> (Deut. 16:3)—in a kind of convulsive rush. Unable to comprehend their own history, they cannot truly hear God’s message or speak their own redemption. The development of their subjectivity becomes the project of the wilderness years, of their process of <i>receiving</i> the Torah, which was given at Sinai. At the same time, Moses, part of them, and representing them, undergoes his own process of coming into language.",
            "This revelatory process is figured in Moses’ repeated movement from the top of the mountain to its base. Ascending to the summit of Sinai, he disappears from the view of the people. Descending to its base, he transmits the messages of the divine; he speaks what he has heard. Reluctantly at first, he parts from the ineffable conversation at the summit, and reenters the human world.",
            "At a critical moment in the process, when the people have been seduced by a Golden Calf, God urges him: “Go on down— <i>Lech red</i>!” The Talmud elaborates: “Go on down from your greatness! I gave you greatness only <i>for the sake of Israel</i>. Now that Israel have sinned, what are you to Me?”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Brachot 32a.</i>",
            "Shockingly, God interrupts Moses’ spiritual joy, his experience of a unique “greatness” in dialogue with God. He is who he is only <i>b’shvil yisrael</i>—“for the sake of Israel.” He is the translator of God’s message, chosen to convey God’s words with his full self, in the full light of his face. He is to speak to and for his people. What does it mean to speak for one’s people?",
            "Moses’ destiny, it emerges, is to speak in his own singular human voice. Achieving a healing relation between this voice and the divine words is the task of Sinai. The man who, according to the Zohar, has a voice but no speech (<i>kol</i> without <i>dibbur</i>), will, like the poet, reach out to his listeners, “using words to express a moan: ah-ah-ah.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Marina Tsvetaeva, <i>Dark Elderberry Branch: Poems of Marina Tsvetaeva</i>, trans.

Sanhedrin 21b) reads this as referring to the obligation for each individual to write his own copy of the Torah: “Write <i>for yourselves</i> . . .”</i> The meanings of the Torah are many; its ultimate passion is direct:",

            "In the end, he writes Deuteronomy, his own book. In the first person, he speaks his own unique being to and for his people. Though his relations with them remain fraught to the end, they are by now <i>his</i> people. Representing the traumatic history of Israel, the Moses figure will more largely come to symbolize Israel’s intellectual and spiritual energy. He becomes its soul-root; his name is given to the Messiah himself.",
            "Moreover, this singular being—the singularly masculine “man Moses,” who becomes the “man of God”—discovers in himself an essentially feminine dimension. At first, this dimension is obscure to himself: he speaks with some horror of a vocation that might claim his <i>maternal</i> devotion (Num. 11:11–12). But as he elaborates on the fantasy of pregnancy, giving birth and suckling a child, he brings to light, however unwillingly, an acknowledgment of the human existence of the feminine. This acknowledgment, too, has a redemptive force: it opens up a universally available feminine inflection of humanity.",
            "Associated with this femininity is a will to communicate, an acceptance of the human body and human relationality. Beginning in the experience of muteness and solitude, Moses moves toward a difficult and singular encounter with the singularities of his people. This too is what is implied in the mission of speaking <i>for</i> his people.",
            "To speak <i>for</i> a Moses whose mission is to speak for his people is to be drawn into a particular kind of thinking. In this study, I allow myself to be provoked by Moses—to be called, challenged. Once in this role, I cannot be unchanged. I am only grateful for this gift, which attaches me to what is beyond me."

            "<b><small>A TALE OF THREE GAZES</small></b><br>Born into a world of genocide, he is nurtured in fear. When he is three months old, his mother places him in a well-caulked box and sets him in the Egyptian river. In this way, she both fulfills and defies the Egyptian decree: “Every male child you shall cast into the river” (Ex. 1:22).",
            "This is the stark framework of Moses’ early infancy. The story is complicated by the palpable tenderness of his mother’s gaze (“She saw him that he was goodly . . .” [2:2]). She hides him as long as she can, she lovingly waterproofs the box, she “sets” him into it, and she “sets” it among the reeds at the river’s edge. Another woman, Moses’ sister, also keeps her gaze fixed on him after he is placed in the river: “to know what would be done to him” (2:4). Yet another woman, Pharaoh’s daughter, sees him in his basket and is stirred to compassion. Under the watchful gaze of three women, he passes through death, from one life to another life.",
            "<b><small>THE EXILE OF THE WORD</small></b><br>His sister’s desire to <i>know</i> brings him through. But it is the stifling climate of <i>not-knowin</i>g that characterizes the world into which Moses is born. The narrative of Exodus begins: “A new king arose over Egypt who <i>did not know</i> Joseph” (1:8). The politics of genocide begin here. In the amnesia of a new king, the gratitude owed to Joseph—who had saved Egypt from famine— is forgotten, and with it all ethical consciousness. Suddenly, without warning, the shadows of envy, hatred, and murder begin to gather.",
            "<i>Not knowing</i> underlies all of Pharaoh’s persecution policies. His arbitrary eclipse of recent history generates a historical crisis. Rashi considers two possibilities:",
            "<small>Rav and Samuel disagreed. One said, This was literally a new king. The other said, His policy was changed. “He did not know” means, He made himself <i>as though he did not know</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi to Ex. 1:8.</i></small>",
            "Whether he was actually a new king or a transformed one, it is difficult to imagine that he would not <i>know</i> Joseph—that he would not remember him or at least his historical impact. So Samuel allows for the possibility of repression, the strategy of un-knowing what one knows. “He made himself as though he did not know.” He actively refuses his own knowledge. Pharaoh’s mind numbs itself so as not to know.",
            "Here, a chord is struck that will swell to epic proportions. In midrashic literature, the climate of <i>Mitzrayim</i> (Egypt) is one of <i>not knowing, not seeing, not hearing, not speaking</i>. Conceived in mystical terms, <i>Mitzrayim</i> is the site of <i>meitzarim</i>, straits, in which possibilities of memory, communication and understanding are narrowed. Here, even breathing becomes congested; the impact of slavery affects the life-rhythms of the sufferers (6:9). The Israelites are at first incapable of <i>hearing</i> the message of redemption, because of <i>kotzar ruach</i>—literally, shortness of breath (Ex. 6:9).",
            "The new Israelite nation is represented at first by a high birth-rate but not a single voice. Mutely, the Israelites undergo the various torments that Pharaoh devises for them. When, finally, at the end of chapter 2, we first hear from them, inchoate cries of pain fill our ears. Four synonyms for <i>crying</i> are used, creating an effect of crazed, wordless suffering:",
            "<small>The Israelites were <i>groaning</i> under the bondage and <i>cried out</i>. And their <i>screams</i> rose up to God. God heard their <i>moaning </i> (2:23–24).</small>",
            "As though no ordered understanding is possible, the sufferers know only the constricted reality of pain, which has the sinister power to “un-make” the world of meaning.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Elaine Scarry, <i>The Body in Pain</i> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1985), 19–22 and passim.</i> The language of the text records the traumatized sound-values of this world. Unexpectedly, these inchoate sounds are registered by God in four responsive verbs: “God heard . . . God remembered . . . God looked . . . God knew . . .” (2:24–25).",
            "In this way, as though unable to remain impervious to human howls of pain, God enters the narrative. His name is repeated four times, with the hypnotic effect of a significant and yet uncanny process. Repetition tends to reduce an utterance to meaninglessness. This God who is so suddenly responsive has been unaccountably absent from Egypt until now. His sudden presence makes palpable His longstanding absence.",
            "Rashi comments: “And God knew . . .”—“He paid attention to them and<i> no longer hid His eyes</i>.” Rashi marks this juncture as a turning point in the narrative. Where before God had been insensible to the suffering of the Israelites, He now hears, remembers, sees, knows. A successful connection with the divine has been made—no small achievement in the straitened <i>Mitzrayim</i> world. Life stirs within a mute and darkened existence. To cry out is to breach the fatality of such a world.",
            "The term that is used in classic mystical texts to describe this constricted condition is <i>Galut ha-dibbur</i>—the Exile of the Word. Language itself suffers a kind of alienation; it loses its force and is lost to human access. At its extreme, even the rudimentary visceral language of moaning and wailing fails to break through. The first stirrings of protest are therefore highly significant. In mystical and Hassidic texts, such stirrings, the cry and the groan, constitute the first movements of the divine within the human. They intimate an imaginable possibility— of desire, of prayer, of language.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Mei HaShiloah Shemot (2). He reads Psalms 66: “Blessed be God Who has not removed my prayer and His love from me” as suggesting that the human possibility of prayer is in itself an expression of divine love.</i>",
            "In the exiled state, language is repressed. A Pharaoh who does not know Joseph has denied vital links with his own past history. A traumatic absence haunts his realm. His edicts blunt feeling and awareness, even the awareness of pain, even in his victims. Eventually, this Pharaoh will answer Moses in their first confrontation, “Who is God that I should listen to His voice? . . . I <i>do not know</i> God!” (5:2). Pharaoh’s passion for ignorance—and for deafness—will develop over the course of the ten Plagues as, time and time again, Moses and Aaron’s pleas fall on deaf ears: <i>And Pharaoh did not listen to them</i>.",
            "The portrait of Pharaoh’s imperviousness even to his own suffering, the compulsive “hardening” of his heart, becomes a refrain throughout the Plague chronicle. Apparently unable to grasp his own history, he enacts a kind of traumatic absence from his own experience.",
            "More poignantly, the notion of the Exile of the Word intimates the unconscious pathology of the Israelites, who are its true victims. Time and again, Moses will protest against his messenger-role: “They will not believe me; they will not listen to me” (4:1). And indeed, as we have noticed, “they did not listen to Moses as a result of exasperation [lit., shortness of breath] and harsh labor” (6:9). And again, “How will Pharaoh listen to me, if they have not listened to me?” (6:12). An epidemic of deafness makes language futile. How should Moses speak in such a world?",
            "One powerful midrashic reading imagines God as holding the displaced consciousness of an inert people. At the Burning Bush, God introduces Himself to Moses as One who sees His people’s afflictions, who hears their cries and who “knows their pain” (3:7). Here, God comments on His own sharpened sensitivity in relation, specifically, to human pain. Here again, Rashi glosses: “I have paid attention to contemplate and know their pain: I have not hidden My eyes, nor shall I block My ears to their cry.” God, at this juncture, is <i>no longer unconscious</i> of human suffering. He departs from a habitual apathy, from an exiled state. But another midrash goes further: “Dead flesh does not feel the scalpel, but I do know their pain, which they themselves do not feel.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lekach Tov in Torah Shelemah Shemoth 126.</i>",
            "In this radical midrash, God constitutes Himself as the site of lost feeling. A traumatized people are compared to “dead flesh.” When God “feels for them,” He, on some level, represents that stirring to sensibility that will restore the dead to life. Divine empathy becomes the holding place for absent experience.",
            "<b><small>UNGRASPABLE HISTORIES</small></b><br>Freud opens his discussion of traumatic neurosis with the example of the survivor of a “shocking accident, for instance a train collision.” Although he is apparently unharmed, the survivor eventually, after what Freud calls an “incubation period,” develops grave symptoms. This phenomenon of <i>latency</i> characterizes the traumatic experience itself. The fact that the victim was, in a sense, not fully present during the accident becomes the eventual ground for its delayed experience. As Cathy Caruth puts it, “The space of unconsciousness is, paradoxically, precisely what preserves the event in its literality.” The paradox that emerges is that “the impact of a history is conveyed, precisely, as what cannot be grasped in the event.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cathy Caruth, <i>Unclaimed Experience</i> (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996), 17–18.</i>",

Belatedness is inherent to traumatic experience— followed by repetitions of the event in the form of nightmare and fantasy, attempts to master what was never fully grasped in the first place.",
            "In the light of Caruth’s discussion, we can understand the Israelites’ “apathy” in the face of their own suffering as a traumatic response to the catastrophe of genocide. The Exile of the Word, which affects all protagonists in the constricted <i>meitzarim</i> world, is conceived in mystical sources as part of a metaphysical condition. But in its lived experience, there is a sense precisely of <i>missed</i> experience, of an unfathomable possibility. Charles Dickens’s Mrs. Gradgrind knows there is a pain somewhere in the room, “but I couldn’t positively say that I have got it.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Charles Dickens, <i>Hard Times</i> (New York: Signet Classics, 1961), 198.</i> For the Israelites, God holds that pain in storage. To appropriate their own pain would allow them, in the full sense, to leave Egypt. Clearly that will not happen overnight; it will require a process for which the wilderness wandering will provide space and time.",
            "<b><small>“WHO AM I?”</small></b><br>Meanwhile, in the world of exile, Moses is to play the central role. He is to be the redeemer, the spokesman between God and the Israelites, God and Pharaoh. He will carry words across gulfs so that they are made good in the world. To this task God urgently summons him: “Moses! Moses!” And commands him, “You shall free (<i>ve-hotze</i>) my people Israel from Egypt” (3:4, 10). These first words of God to Moses evoke from the outset the issue of <i>hotze</i>, of <i>extracting, bringing out</i>. These words emerge “from out of the Burning Bush,” from the thorny complexity of human pain.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Shemot Rabba 2:7: “God said to Moses, Do you not feel that I am in distress, just as Israel is in distress? Be aware that the place from which I speak to you is in the midst of thorns, I am their partner in distress!”</i> This is the site from which God addresses Moses, simply asking to be <i>extracted</i>, in His involvement with His people, from the closed world that is <i>tzara</i>, the constriction in which one cannot move without further anguish.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The midrashic proof-texts accompanying such passages of involvement are typically, “I am with him in his distress” (Ps. 91), and “In all their troubles He was troubled” (Isa. 63:9). God is with His people, He is in their troubles. Like them, He is submerged and seeks to emerge.</i>",
            "An eruption from out of silence, these words open a channel in the depths of Moses’ being. “Here I am!” he responds, in the manner of Abraham before the Binding of Isaac. A shaft has penetrated him. But his next words are “<i>Who am I</i>?—that I should go to Pharaoh and extract the Israelites from Egypt?” (3:11). Moses’ reaction to the divine call is ambivalent: he is ready to serve, but he doubts himself. Like other prophets after him, he expresses his sense of inadequacy to the role that God assigns him. But his question, “Who am I?” stands alone, starkly separate from the immediate context, just as he stands alone among prophets.",
            "For Moses, this is the essential question, “<i>Mi Anochi</i>? Who am I?” This is his intimate response to God’s claim on him, “I am the God of your father.” In midrashic commentary, God speaks in a recognizable voice, so as not to shock the amateur prophet: He assumes his father’s voice.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shemot Rabba 3:1.</i> But in all questions having to do with Moses’ parentage, an ambiguity inheres. Does Moses in fact know his biological father’s voice? In the biblical text there is nothing to suggest that he has any contact with his birth family once he is adopted by the Egyptian princess. The ambiguous reference to the father’s voice begs the question: Which father? How well does Moses know his birth father’s voice? God’s voice evokes Moses’ sense of dual identity. Quite naturally, in this case, he responds out of his own duality: “<i>Who am I?</i>”—“How does my identity qualify me for this role?”",
            "For Moses the issue of identity is fraught with ambiguity from the beginning. The opening scenes of his story yield two mothers, a narrative of birth, death, and rebirth. Although the princess, in retrieving him from the river, identifies him as “one of the Hebrew children,” she clearly regards herself as “birthing” (<i>mosheh</i>) him from the waters that are death to Hebrew children. And when Miriam hires, in the princess’s name, a “wet nurse from the Hebrews”—Moses’ birth mother—the arrangement is clear: it is a commercial transaction in which the birth mother is paid for her services. She suckles her own child “for” the princess.",
            "Returned to life from the Egyptian river, Moses is restored to his mother’s breast. But this is an ambiguous return: the true mother is a hired proxy for another mother. When the child “grows” (2:10), at the appropriate moment of development, his birth mother brings him to Pharaoh’s daughter—a movement inward, into an interior—“and he was to her a son.” She is now to all intents and purposes his mother. She names him Moshe— in Egyptian, “son”—and explains the name: “for I drew him out from the water.” The Hebrew puns on Egyptian and Hebrew meanings for the Moshe root: her motherhood is based on her gift of life to the child, whom she has extracted by the force of her compassion from the fatal river.",
            "Moses’ double identity is subtly, ironically etched in his complex birth story. Son to two mothers, what does he know in his Egyptian life of his previous life? Does he remember his Hebrew origins? If this is a story of salvation, its parameters are fraught with questions. This story of salvation holds repression at its heart. The conventional narrative movement of loss and retrieval, trouble and resolution, is interrupted; Moses’ subjective experience remains largely obscure.",
            "When he is restored to his birth mother, does the milk of her breast taste the same as it did before he was put in the river? During the palace period, does he remember—or, is he told of—his birth mother, her complicated milk? The text is silent on this, but the rupture with his birth family seems stark.",
            "<b><small>THE UNCANNY BOND OF BROTHERHOOD</small></b><br>However, when he does emerge from his Egyptian cocoon, the narrative startles us: “Moses grew and went forth <i>to his brothers</i>, and he saw their suffering” (2:11). This can be read simply to indicate that his purpose was to find out more about the slave people who, he is aware, are his birth nation. On this view, he is intentionally reconnecting with a past that still lives in his memory. This would be reinforced by another phrase in the same verse, where the slaves are again described as his birth nation: “He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew man, one of <i>his brothers</i>.” Perhaps, after all, Moses has always known of his kinship with the Hebrew slaves; on this day, he sets himself, as their brother, to <i>see</i> their sufferings.",
            "However, there are other possible narratives. Perhaps, as we originally assumed, the young prince does not know of his connection with these slaves. Perhaps it is the narrator who refers to the uncanny bond of brotherhood between prince and slaves. This would then be a moment of dramatic irony, since the narrator and the reader know more than the protagonist. Or, perhaps, fraternity is precisely what Moses <i>discovers</i>, when he emerges from a clear and untroubled Egyptian identity. Precisely when he witnesses human suffering, a new fraternal consciousness arises within him. Once he allows himself to <i>see</i>, he arrives obliquely at a knowledge of brotherhood. This is the meaning of <i>va-yigdal—“he grew”</i>: this is his first crisis of maturation.",
            "In a fit of empathy with the victim, he kills the Egyptian tormentor—almost as though in self-defense. The next day, when he again emerges—as part of this crisis of development— from the palace, there is no <i>seeing</i>. Instead, there is a <i>hineh</i>—the shock of an incomprehensible event: two Hebrews in violent combat. The aggressor taunts Moses with his own violence of yesterday. To this, Moses has no response other than to flee the vengeance of Pharaoh. The discovery of “wickedness,” aggression, and malice, even among the victims, complicates his spontaneous act of identification. Here, the word “brothers” is no longer used. He apparently recognizes nothing of himself in this second scene.",
            "On this reading, Moses’ separation from his origins is quite complete. It is precisely his brothers’ suffering that intimates a strange kinship. Beyond conscious awareness, a profound chord is struck. Something of this notion is suggested in midrashic reflections on Moses’ first act in the world. The infant Moses hidden in the caulked box or basket in the reeds is first perceived by the princess as a <i>na’ar bocheh</i>—a “crying youth.” His cries elicit her compassion and her identification of him as “one of the Hebrew children.” But the expression <i>na’ar</i>, youth, jarringly evokes a much older child. It disrupts the classic scene of womanly compassion aroused by a baby’s cries. The Talmud comments: “R. Yehuda said, His voice was like a young man’s. R. Nehemia objected: But if you say so, you have given Moses a blemish!”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus Rabba 1:28.</i> In itself, this interchange between sages is deeply expressive. R. Yehuda focuses on Moses’ voice, which is mature beyond his years. In objecting, R. Nehemiah intimates that such precociousness would be a physical peculiarity, a form of disability.",
            "But another midrash carries the idea of an over-developed organ even further.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tzror HaMor.</i> The <i>na’ar</i> in the text evokes another <i>na’ar</i>: “For Israel is a youth and I love him” (Hosea 11:1). In the words of Hosea, God loves Israel as one loves a young man who is volatile, full of turbulent energy. By offering this verse as a proof-text, the midrash suggests that Moses is precociously identified with his people’s pain, giving voice to a transpersonal anguish. Perhaps it is the princess who hears the baby’s voice as expressive of a larger trauma?",
            "Her perception of the infant is also deepened in another Talmudic reading: “She opened [the box] and saw <i>him, the child</i>” (2:6). “She saw God’s Presence with him.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">B. Sotah 12b. The Talmud may be reading <i>et ha-yeled</i> as “<i>with </i>the child.”</i> Perhaps she sees some kind of aura surrounding the child, as indicated by the double object in the biblical verse. Like the baby’s birth mother, she sees in the light of love. Her gaze is filled with desire for all that the baby may mean.",
            "The child Moses weeps and expresses a pain larger than he knows. The gaze of the princess confirms his original mirroring in his birth mother’s eyes. But at the same time, a rupture now begins. Handed back and forth between mothers, one claiming him, the other feeding him, his identity becomes a question rather than a given. “Who am I?” he protests when God would cast him in the redeemer role.",
            "The same Talmudic discussion interrupts the apparently unbroken narrative in which a wet nurse is hired. Before he is assigned to the Hebrew wet nurse, there is a suppressed episode in which many Egyptian candidates are tried out. This would be a natural first step, since the royal household would have retained a staff for this purpose. “But he would not nurse! God said, “The mouth that is destined to speak with My Presence should not nurse from an impure source!”",
            "This infant is fastidious, his mouth already haunted by his future. The primal bond between infant and breast is troubled by thoughts beyond his grasp. His mother is restored to him only after she is thoroughly lost in a world of phantom breasts.",
            "Is it surprising, then, that this infant will weep with a voice beyond his years—as though he knows what he cannot yet know? Or that this voice will be imagined as representing a “blemish”? Later, at the Burning Bush, he will try to express a kind of dis-ease in the mouth, an oral blockage: “I am not a man of words . . . heavy of mouth and heavy of tongue” (4:10). And still later: “I am of uncircumcised lips!” (6:12, 30). This is the only direct description Moses ever gives of his inner life. It may refer to an actual stammer; more importantly, it expresses an intimate experience of, precisely, <i>galut ha-dibbur</i>, the Exile of the Word. In his mouth, a metaphysical condition takes on immediate reality. What he has to say, he feels, will be stifled at birth: no one will hear, neither Pharaoh nor the Israelites.",

We remember the benign narrative of how he comes to nurse at his own mother’s breast; but also the shadow version in which the obscure pain of a larger world haunts his instinctual life even in infancy. His natural appetite must yield to a destiny of <i>speaking</i> to God. There is a rupture between the uses of the mouth; some basic trust in the world is put in question.",

Satirically, he projects an image of himself with the body of a woman, or some hybrid figment of an <i>omen</i>—a male wet nurse—with breasts to feed a hungry infant. The surrealistic fantasy expresses his sense that he is miscast in the role of nurturer. He was once the infant whose mouth was in some way mismatched with the world.",
            "His protest is both poignant and grotesque, as was his original self-description as “of uncircumcised lips.” Together, the hybrid fantasy—lips, foreskin, the male body crossed with a fictional female body—constitutes a “raid on the inarticulate.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">T.

His mother reveals how, as an ambitious young singer, she gave him to a friend, an English aristocrat, to rear as his own. This common theme in Victorian literature—the abandoned child, the lost parents—is here complicated by the fact that Deronda acquires a more illustrious pedigree when he is thus adopted; and, at the same time, loses the hidden majesty of his Jewish ancestry.",

Exiled child of doomed parents, he is haunted by visions of star-­ shaped fortresses, of fog and trains and windmills.

Further on in the story of Moses, said Austerlitz, I particularly liked the episode where the children of Israel cross a terrible wilderness, many days’ journey long and wide, with nothing in sight but sky and sand as far as the eye can see. I tried to picture the pillar of cloud going before the people on their wanderings “to lead them the way,” as the Bible puts it, and I immersed my self, forgetting all around me, in a full-page illustration showing the desert of Sinai looking just like the part of Wales where I grew up. . . . I knew that my proper place was among the tiny figures populating the camp. I examined every square inch of the illustration, which seemed to me uncannily familiar. I thought I could make out a stone quarry in a rather lighter patch on the steep slope of the mountain over to the right, and I seemed to see a railway track in the regular curve of the lines below it. But my mind dwelt chiefly on the fenced square in the middle and the tent-like building at the far end, with a cloud of white smoke above it.

Austerlitz is haunted by his memory of a sixteenth-century Belgian painting, particularly of a woman fallen on the ice: “I feel as if [this] moment . . . had never come to an end, as if the canary-yellow lady had only just fallen over or swooned . . . as if the little accident . . . were always happening over and over again, and nothing and no one could ever remedy it” (13–14).

The unplayed instrument is well and truly played. For Austerlitz, identity and purpose are known only as forever lost, poignant eruptions from unseen worlds. The self is dispersed, helpless, abandoned.

At the moment of greatest pressure, when His promises have, apparently, failed the test of history, Moses cries out: “O God! Why have You done evil to this people? Why then did you send me? Since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has made things worse for Your people: <i>You have not saved Your people</i>!” (Ex. 5:22–23). Moses here brushes against the unspeakable. God’s words have not merely been ineffective in bringing about salvation; they have proved <i>meaningless</i> in the ruthless press of reality, which is Pharaoh’s realm. The <i>meitzarim</i>, the straits of senseless suffering, close in on the hopes of flesh and blood. This is the true “evil” of which Moses speaks: God’s words ring hollow in human perception.",
            "In this crisis, God responds: “<i>Now you shall see</i> what I will do.” As if to intimate that the story proper begins only now, God speaks of this breaking point as a turning point. In the writings of R. Yaakov Leiner, the scion of the Ishbitz line of Hassidic masters, this critical moment becomes a paradigm of the salvation process. Moses’ cry of outrage is to be the trigger of a redemption delayed till now. God’s promises have awakened hope in the people, but till now they have remained unconsummated. A paradoxical process is necessary. God’s words must go through a process of <i>exile</i>, of breaking apart, as in the original process of world creation, when an absolute Presence shattered into brilliant fragments.",

He translates: “When good thoughts occur and are <i>immediately lost</i>, this is because <i>ein sod</i>, because they do not emerge from the hidden depths of the heart.” R. Leiner seizes on a singularly modern moment of awareness, the moment of “forgetting,” of the loss of consciousness. In order to absorb the message of redemption, deep work is necessary, “from the depths of the heart.” Without this, words, even divine words, are constantly in danger of being lost, of dissolving into exile.",

The power of these conditions lies in the fact that they are not only external, imposed by others: they live in the internal world of the victim, answering to unconscious fears and desires.",

Here, Pharaoh responds to God’s demand, “Let My people go!” by tightening the vise still further (Ex. 5:1–10). In fact, the pattern is set from the beginning. Pharaoh’s decree that midwives dispose of male Hebrew infants is foiled, only to be followed by a harsher, more official decree: <i>All</i> Egyptians are to be involved in the drowning of <i>all</i> Israelite male infants (1:22).",

The individual narrative of Moses’ birth serves partially as a metaphor for the Israelite opening to life in a time of genocide. Here again, his story is both singular and representative. In midrashic diffractions of the episode, Moses’ father at first separates from his wife in the terror of the times. His daughter Miriam compels him to see that he is in effect submitting to Pharaoh’s decree. (“Your decree is worse than Pharaoh’s,” she says; “He decrees against male children, you against all children!” He is doing Pharaoh’s work of constriction for him, only more effectively!)

The women playing with what-may-be, with the fictions of possibility, threaten a proper sense of order. But what God implies is that the ordered is often the defensive: it is Pharaoh’s constricted invention, a <i>meitzar</i>-device, narrowing what can be understood by human life.",
            "In the midrash, these copper mirrors are to be taken in, incorporated into the Tabernacle, in the form of the copper stand and ewer used by the priests to sanctify themselves. At divine command, erotic and sacred realities are merged. Indeed, as Ramban points out, unlike other copper contributions to the Tabernacle, the women’s mirrors were not melted down to be re-formed into the sacred accoutrements. They retained their integrity as mirrors, with the disturbing associations that Moses finds so offensive.",
            "Moses both desires and fears language: he longs for the power of names to stabilize and unify experience, while he fears its dynamic, endlessly protean character. Fictions give birth to further fictions, till the ground of truth has been lost. Or, paradoxically, we might say that the opposite is true: what he fears is the limiting, narrowing effect of language, while he longs for its capacity to break out of the armor of rigid meanings. This second ambivalence is represented by God in the midrash, urging Moses to broaden his vision of the mirror reality. He is to find a way out of exile, specifically, out of the Exile of the Word that is the most radical manifestation of all exiles.",

We remember Austerlitz’s description of the sixteenth-century Belgian painting; the woman who has fallen on the ice comes to represent a fatality, the way “marks of pain trace countless fine lines through history. This is always happening over and over again. Nothing and no-one could remedy it” (14). In Austerlitz’s mind, the sheer repetition of historical anguish, like a stammer, speaks of an irremediable state.",
            "And yet, the painter’s work, Austerlitz’s broken narrative, and Sebald’s complex framing of that narrative are mirrors-within-mirrors, performing a barely glimpsed possibility.

            "Novelli’s story emerges from Austerlitz’s storehouse of memories when he thinks of the tortures inflicted on prisoners in the Breedonk fortress; he remembers Claude Simon’s “storehouse of memories,” among them “the fragmentary tale of a certain Gastone Novelli,” who, after being tortured at Dachau, found the sight of a German, or of any civilized being, so intolerable that he went off to the South American jungle, where he completed a dictionary of the language of the tribe of pygmies among whom he lived. This language consisted almost entirely of vowels, particularly the sound A in countless variations. Later, Novelli returned to his native land and began to paint pictures, mostly featuring the letter A, formations “rising and falling in waves like a long-drawn-out scream.",

Yaakov Leiner would have us hear this cry as the “beginning of redemption”: “Now, you will see what I will do,” God tells Moses. At the darkest hour, when language, even divine words of promise, fails altogether, at that breaking point, what is lost may become unlost. The sufferer may open herself to an intimation, something emerging from depths never before fathomed. This is the work of the mirrors, which performs redemption in a different language.",
            "Another Hassidic reading speaks of a people who can barely experience their own history. When God arrives at His ultimate promise of redemption, which is to demonstrate that His words do indeed hold good, He uses four synonyms: “I will take you out, I will save you, I will redeem you, I will take you to Me as a people” (Ex. 6:6–7). This is known as “the four languages of redemption”: four repetitions that are not repetitions —divine stammers . . . But the Israelites, we are told, “did not hear” these words (6:9). Moses tries to convey this message of redemption, but the message falls on deaf ears.",

The effect of repression is the fertility of re-membering, of the effort to create coherent narratives in an experience of rupture.",
            "The traumatic gap in communication is indicated, writes Sefat Emet, by the word <i>chipazon</i>, “panic haste.” This expresses the inherent nature of such traumatic departures: “You shall eat it [the Paschal lamb] in <i>chipazon</i>” (12:11), God instructs Moses just before the Exodus. And forty years later, in retrospect, Moses remembers, “You left Egypt in <i>chipazon</i>” (Deut. 16:3).",
            "The unassimilated experience of the Exodus is made good by generations of storytelling. Each in its own language, the generations play out the multiple possibilities—the four languages—of redemption. In telling these stories of unclaimed experience, we fulfill a <i>mitzvah</i>, a positive commandment. From the unregistered power of the Exodus, Torah is made for all generations.",
            "The implications of this passage are quite astonishing. Writing at the end of the nineteenth century, Sefat Emet departs from positivist readings of the Exodus: in place of the conventional narrative—“This is what God promised; the people heard and believed; God’s words are fulfilled in an immediate authentication of the divine role in history”—he offers a world in which forgetting, unawareness, and silence are the breeding ground of fertile re-memberings. The languages of the descendants constitute a Torah-revelation that redeems the repressed historical moment.",

            "The main fact of their history becomes the repression of the event, as it happens in real time. Redemption and revelation happen both too late and too soon. On the night of the Exodus, they wait, girded and booted, for the moment of departure. Then it is upon them and they rush out of Egypt! There is something ungainly, both bashful and precipitate, about this redemption. A time lag is built in.",

            "<b><small>FOR THE SAKE OF ISRAEL</small></b><br>Just as Moses has fulfilled the first stage of his mission— to carry God’s word to Pharaoh—his relations with God reach breaking point:",
            "<small>Then Moses turned to God and said, “O God, why did You  do evil to this people? Why then did You send me? Ever  since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has made  things worse for this people; You have definitely not saved  Your people!” (Ex. 5:22–23)</small>",
            "Moses’ words are suffused with anger, reproach, frustration. As God’s messenger of redemption—“Let My people go!”—he has been miserably ineffective: Pharaoh’s “evil,” so far from abating, has gathered cruel force; Moses has failed his people. Ultimately, God Himself is responsible for the “evil” in which the people are embroiled.",
            "“<i>Lamah—Why?</i>” he asks twice. For the first time in the biblical narrative, a human being addresses God with the rhetorical <i>lamah</i>. Moses breaks new ground, uttering a new and provocative form of question, as though he has the right to understand God’s dealings with the world. Using the word <i>Ra— evil</i> of God, Moses juxtaposes God’s dealings with those of the evil Pharaoh. The Israelites are enveloped in a medium of instability, where God makes promises and then apparently reneges on them: “<i>Save?—You have not saved Your people!</i>” Moses cries with some irony, implicitly quoting God’s promise back to Him: “I have come down to save them” (Ex. 3:8).",
            "“<i>Lamah—Why?</i>” The demand for explanations has previously appeared only in human dialogues, in protests against tyranny. A few verses before this breaking point, the Israelites cried out in outrage to Pharaoh: “<i>Why</i> should you act in this manner to your servants?” (5:15). Now, Moses unconsciously picks up this <i>lamah</i> of protest and turns it against God, challenging Him in a new voice.",
            "This voice of Moses represents areas of human experience never before plumbed.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Moses will voice the <i>lamah</i> note repeatedly as he attempts to bridge the gap between God and the people.

But since his relation to the people is ambivalent, he refers to them in two ways: as “<i>this</i> people,” suggesting a relation of estrangement; but also as “<i>Your</i> people,” advocating for them as objects of God’s love. It is only at a later stage that he will speak in the voice of conscious solidarity.",

            "<small>R. Akiva said that Moses argued thus: “I know that You will one day save them, but what about those who will have been immured in the buildings?” Then the Attribute of Justice sought to strike Moses, but after God saw that Moses argued thus only for the sake of Israel, He did not allow the Attribute of Justice to strike him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shemot Rabba 5:27.</i></small>",

            "The midrash ends with a complex divine response. The “judgmental” God (the Attribute of Justice) is poised to strike Moses down for his irreverence. But the compassionate God relents—when He sees that Moses speaks “for the sake of Israel.” The Hebrew expression is <i>bishvil Yisrael</i>: Moses speaks for the benefit of Israel, for their good. But, as well, he speaks “on their behalf,” in their name, representing those who cannot speak for themselves—the voices that are in constant danger of suffocation.",
            "Here, God understands Moses in a newly complex way—as though He hears him “in chords,” with meanings from many different worlds. What is it to speak, both in God’s name and in the name of vulnerable flesh and blood? A double-voiced singer, like those Mongolian singers who can utter more than one pitch at the same time, Moses begins to develop the singular polyphonic ability of his double mission.",
            "Here, he represents those who cannot speak for themselves. Among the four evocations of pain—groans, cries, wails, screams —which are the first sounds we hear from the silent people (2:24), is the word <i>na’aka</i>: “When God heard their <i>na’aka</i>, He remembered His covenant.” What is a <i>na’aka</i>? In Ramban’s reading, this refers to the death rattle of those who are immured in the Egyptian building projects. Ramban cites a proof-text from Ezekiel: “They cried out with the <i>na’aka</i> of those who are being slain” (30:24).",
            "In Ezekiel’s vision of the Dry Bones, the dead cry out, “Our bones are dried up, we are cut off” (Ezek. 37:11).

            "When Moses speaks <i>on behalf</i> of Israel, then, he acts as a proxy voice, amplifying and supplementing their inchoate sounds. In this role, he is forgiven for his irreverent tone. He is recognized for a new genre of expressiveness; he lends his vitality to the people’s inertia. He is not of them, nor is he like them. He is separate from them—reared in a different world— and yet, he is in some uncanny relation with them that allows him to give voice to their despair.",
            "God strikingly responds, “I too have heard the <i>na’aka</i> of the Israelites” (Ex. 6:5). As though to say: “You are not the only one to care about their fragility!” Once Moses has given voice to their strangled cries, God declares Himself his ally in empathy.",
            "But if Moses advocates for a people who cannot afford to wait for redemption, he also speaks for a God who requires a human voice to represent Him. Strangely, it is Moses, with his “uncircumcised lips,” who is the necessary mediator between the divine and the human. What does he, uniquely, bring to the “impossible” process of redemption?",
            "<b><small>WORDS AND VOICE</small></b><br>A remarkable suggestion appears in the nineteenth-century commentary <i>Ha’amek Davar</i>. At the Burning Bush, God charges Moses with his first message to the Israelite elders. He then reassures Moses, even before he has expressed any reservations, “They will listen to your voice!” (3:18). Moses listens silently to the rest of God’s speech and then bursts out in protest, “But they will not believe me, <i>they will not listen to my voice!</i>” (4:1).",
            "On the face of it, Moses cannot accept God’s reassurances. So convinced is he that his voice will have no effect on his people that he directly contradicts God’s promise. He feels mysteriously handicapped, incapable of convincing the Israelites that he, of all people, has received a divine revelation. He is, after all, only tangentially identified as one of them; he is not a plausible candidate for the leadership of a people with whom he has merely biological kinship. His sense of being “heavy of mouth and heavy of tongue” is perhaps the effect of his weak links with the community. He feels handicapped because they will not “listen to his voice.”",
            "However, <i>Ha’amek Davar</i> has a different reading. God’s reassurance (“They will listen to your voice”) is not simply a promise; it is a condition, a demand: “Only if you speak <i>with your own voice</i> will they listen and join you in challenging Pharaoh.” In this reading, the whole scenario of redemption depends on this one condition: Moses’ voice must be heard. In the event, Moses refuses to speak and Aaron is delegated to convey God’s words. So the elders hear God’s words, but in the wrong voice.",
            "The result is that the scenario of redemption falters. The elders are not inspired to accompany Moses to the palace. Instead, Moses and Aaron go alone; they speak in the name of God (“Thus says God, the God of Israel, Let My people go, so they may feast for Me in the wilderness” [5:1]), rather than in the name of the people, expressing the will of the people (“The God of the Hebrews appeared to <i>us</i>—so now let us go a journey of three days into the wilderness” [3:18]).",
            "What should have been a popular movement of spiritual enthusiasm is attenuated into the stark command of God. In <i>Ha’amek Davar</i>, the whole narrative is read with an eye for the discrepancies between God’s scenario and what actually transpires—and the commentary concludes that since Moses withheld his <i>voice</i>, the redemptive process was, in important ways, disrupted.",
            "In this remarkable reading, words and voice are differentiated. Moses refuses to lend his voice to the occasion. It is precisely his voice that he distrusts. But this voice is what God asks for. In his own voice, Moses might have affected and transformed their fate. In the expression of the midrash, “The Shechina (God’s Presence) spoke out of his throat.” Ventriloquist for God, Moses’ voice might have inspired the people more poignantly than could the divine words alone.",
            "Here, the whole process of redemption pivots on Moses’ absent voice. But, we might ask, if his voice carries divine undertones, why is he so embarrassed about using it? And why does God lay the weight of redemption on a man whose voice in some sense fails him?",

But then God intimates, by changing His tone, that His anger is only superficial. <i>Dibbur </i>changes to <i>amira</i>, which signifies a soft tone—a whisper of reassurance out of which He names Himself by the name of Compassion. “I am God of the Four Letters [known as the Tetragrammaton].”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mei HaShiloach 1, VaEra.</i>",

            "In another passage, Mei HaShiloach discusses the troubled human response to what he calls the Attribute of Justice in God’s dealings with human beings. By this he means the cruel and incomprehensible events that may befall a person. Such experiences are, in a sense, more easily handled by someone who is not involved in a relationship with God. Because the believer strives to discern God’s meaning in whatever befalls him, he is particularly bewildered and angry when God acts inscrutably.",
            "For the nonbeliever, such experiences can be attributed to chance. Intrusions of nothingness, of the murmuring deep, into the life of the believer, however, are unbearable. God’s voice becomes unrecognizable. The believer, therefore, is prone to states of resentment against God.",
            "This kind of theological resentment, advises Mei HaShiloach, is toxic to the soul. So God tells Moses, “Say (<i>Emor</i>) to the priests . . .”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the Zohar, the “soft” tone of <i>Emor</i> is commonly identified as a whisper.</i> “In a <i>whisper</i>,” the Zohar translates. “Whisper to the angry believer that God’s intentions are always only benevolent.

            "The whisper is the tone, the voice, of something elemental that softens the stridency of theological claims.

            "This secrecy—the whisper—informs the central act of prayer: the Amidah prayer is to be uttered “in a whisper” ­(<i>b’lachash</i>). The instruction acts like a musical direction; standing before God, the human being speaks statutory words that are whispered in the intimacy of a particular voice, crying from the deep.",
            "What, then, is the quality of voice, the singular timbre that belongs to Moses alone? In being spoken “for Israel” (<i>b’shvil Israel</i>), even his sacrilegious protests have a power that God accepts. Although he has, in a sense, nothing in common with this slave people whom he now must acknowledge as his own, his voice nevertheless, it seems, resonates with a unique timbre.

It enthralls us, but it robs us, frustrates and distances us. It is not communication, he claims, only to qualify his own claim: “or at the most it is a dark and maimed language.” In the end, he even acknowledges precisely the human commonality of such language; Celan gives voice to a mortal solitude beyond language.",
            "As Agamben points out, Primo Levi had already attempted to listen to the “inarticulate babble” of a child survivor, in the days following the liberation of Auschwitz. This child, whom the deportees call Hurbinek, emits inarticulate sounds; he is paralyzed from the waist down",

            "Every act of testimony—perhaps “every word, every writing,” declares Agamben, engages, in this sense, with something to which no one has ever borne witness: “This is the sound that arises from the lacuna, the non-language that one speaks when one is most alone, the non-language to which language answers, in which language is born.”",
            "In a sweeping movement, Agamben describes the meaningful use of words as precisely that which expresses what was inexpressible. The “true witness” is dead, or in the throes of dying.

Normally, one might say that the survivor bears witness to the fate of the dehumanized, dumbstruck victim. But if “we speak in their stead, by proxy,” this means that, in some way, the one who truly bears witness in the human is the inhuman: “It means that the human is none other than the agent of the inhuman, the one who lends the inhuman a voice.” The survivor lends the true witness a voice, but the survivor has nothing of his own to say.",

If Moses is acknowledged by God for “speaking on behalf of Israel,” this can be understood as discovering in himself a passion to be present, to bear witness, precisely to the death cries of Israelites, his brothers, with whom he as yet has, socially and culturally, nothing in common. For testimony to take place, the speechless ones must make the speaking one speak. Without Moses, they die immured in a tomb of dumbness, like the child Hurbinek. But, even more, without them, Moses has <i>experienced</i> nothing to speak of.",

He must acknowledge his kinship with those who have seen the Gorgon.",
            "In this sense, as Agamben puts it, “Every creator is always a co-creator.” Moses lends his voice to the inhuman; only thus, completed by the one who cannot bear witness, will he himself become capable of serious speech.

            "<small>The Sages said (B. Niddah 30b): When the newborn emerges into the air of the world, an angel comes and strikes it on the mouth and makes it forget the whole Torah. Why does the angel strike it on the mouth? For it is by way of the mouth that the newborn becomes a living, speaking human being; and by the same blow on the mouth, the angel makes the infant forget the whole Torah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Maharal, <i>Gevurot Hashem</i>, ch. 28.</i></small>",
            "Maharal goes on to explain that it is through the mouth —through language—that the newborn becomes a complex physical-spiritual being. Before the child is born, it is pure soul, unattached to body, and knowing “the whole Torah.” Its creation as a speaking, living human being is completed only after the angel has struck it on the mouth, at the same moment making it forget its previous oceanic soul-existence and opening it to language. Now the child is fully born into the complex human reality. He cites the classic Aramaic translation of Onkelos: “‘Man became a <i>living being</i>’ (Gen. 2:7): he became a living, <i>speaking</i> being.”",
            "Language, then, constitutes the human being; at the same time, it represents a <i>loss</i>. The child loses its pre-human “total knowledge”; the angelic blow obscures and diminishes a primal oceanic harmony; but at the same time opens the mouth of the newborn. A full, complicated being is now born. Embodied soul, he or she bears the insignia of an extraordinary loss that is also an extraordinary gain. Immaculately made, the newborn must suffer a split, precisely in the place of the mouth. Impossible knowledge and embodied voice struggle to testify. The child begins to speak the “out-of-joint” language of an incarnate spirit.",
            "The most striking part of Maharal’s reading is its ending. Here, Maharal uses the Talmudic myth of human creation to explain Moses’ speech defect. Moses, he declares, remains mysteriously untouched by the angel’s blow. His being has never been diminished and evolved in the way the myth describes. He retains a pristine access to “the whole Torah.” In him, language is undeveloped; he is, in a sense, not fully born to language and to ordinary humanity.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Maharal cites another Talmudic passage (Ta’anit 11b) that describes Moses as serving in the Tabernacle during the eight days of its inauguration, clothed in a pure white garment, “without an <i>imra</i>” (a fringe, or cuff—also, speech). Moses’ outward appearance reflects the immaculate purity of his being, uncompromised by language, by the fray-able edge of things, which requires reinforcement. In this, Moses’ garment is unlike that of the priests who will take over from him in the Tabernacle after the period of inauguration.</i>",
            "Maharal here conveys a “secret” understanding of Moses’ state as nonspeaker. He is unhindered, undiminished, and therefore, in a sense, not fully human. He has not yet entered the midst of life. When, therefore, Moses speaks of his own inadequacy as speaker, he increasingly becomes aware of a need to enter into the world of language. If he is to speak <i>to</i> as well as <i>for</i> his newly acquired brothers, he must be born into loss. Purity of being must give way to the possible embarrassments of language. If he is to be <i>with</i> the Israelites, he must surrender to the incompleteness of a human life. In this way, perhaps, his people will hear him, as one hears one of one’s own kind.",
            "In the biblical text, we can trace Moses’ development in this direction. One indication is the way his language becomes more expressive each time he returns to the subject of his speech defect. Increasingly, he becomes aware of <i>lacking</i> something he now desires. At first, at the Burning Bush, he describes himself as “not a man of words,” a neutral observation. Then, he is “heavy of mouth, and heavy of tongue”—a more sensual depiction of a burden, an excess impeding the flow of language.",
            "Only after he has begun to fulfill his mission—speaking to Pharaoh to no avail, and then to the Israelites, also to no avail (Ex. 6:9)—does his language erupt in the grotesque imagery of “I am of uncircumcised lips!” (6:12, 30). A foreskin closes his lips, so that they are webbed shut. The movement, somewhat comic, of the mouth compulsively opening and closing, is alien to him. He is whole, singular, and contained in his knowledge of “the whole Torah.”",

In this cryptic narrative, Moses is saved from death by his wife, Tzippora, who takes a flint and cuts off her son’s foreskin.

His greatness will emerge only from that position with and for his people.",

In this case, it is the Golden Calf that draws him back down and out to the base of the mountain, where he sees the Calf and the dancing worshippers, and smashes the stone Tablets inscribed by the finger of God. Again, he ascends upward and inward; this time, when, after eighty days, he rejoins the people with a new set of Tablets, he bears on his face the mark of his communion with God:",

Then, he calls them and gradually all come close while he speaks to them.",
            "It is striking that we learn of his singular radiance only in the context of his unawareness. This too, perhaps, becomes part of the people’s vision.

In this rather cumbersome account, it seems that his face is exposed <i>only until</i> he finishes speaking with God.

Only after he finishes speaking to them does he replace the veil.",

The nineteenth-­ century commentator Ha’amek Davar offers an imaginative reading of the passage. Are there perhaps three positions of the veil, rather than two?

In this way, the people can see his radiance in the moment of teaching. At other moments, the veil is unfolded to cover his face.",
            "This practice of veiling and revealing represents something of the tension of revelation itself. In order to teach what he has learned, in order to act <i>for the sake of </i>his people, Moses must relinquish something of his inner life. A sacrifice is called for in order to establish his relation with the people that alone justifies his communion with God. At the same time, he must speak of and from that inner life.",

The skin of his face expresses the physical fragility of the boundary between inner and outer. Expressive of inner states, and vulnerable to external impingement, the skin betrays one’s privacy. But the teacher’s face is an integral part of the teaching experience. Thus he folds back the veil so that his students will look at his face.",
            "In later times, the sages will recommend that one should look at one’s teacher’s face as (s)he speaks. They derive this notion of the face as a pedagogical medium from Isaiah 30:20:“And your eyes shall see your teacher’s face.” Here, Moses “folds up” the veil, because he <i>desires</i> the <i>desire</i> of his people to see his face at this first fully pedagogical moment.",
            "In his arresting reading, Ha’amek Davar sheds light on the ways in which the human face, in the image of God, expresses nuanced meanings and engages with the yearnings of those who listen to words of Torah. Moses <i>desires</i> to draw their eyes to the subtleties of the unsaid, of the implicit, or the ironic, that may be registered fleetingly but powerfully in facial gesture. In this foundational moment, his listeners will be drawn by the singular glow of a face that has been in direct communion with God. Like the light of the sun, this glow has an erotic force. Later generations of students will already know that the teacher’s face, even if he has not attained such communion, has much to offer them.",
            "By speaking of desire, Ha’amek Davar places us firmly within Moses’ perspective. Moses is moved by a desire to be known, even if this involves sacrificing the intensity of his inner life. There emerges a portrait of Moses the man who reveals himself and veils himself; and of Moses the teacher whose inner world is partially exposed in the space between open and closed, between known and unknown, between inward and outward being. This is an erotic space, traversed by eye beams and rays of light. The folded-back veil communicates a moment of exposure, already framed by its own darkness. In some Hassidic readings, in fact, the veil is simply the appearance of “normality,” behind which Moses can pursue his inner life.",

The effect, as Ha’amek Davar stages it, generates desire—desire to see and to hear the words of Torah emerging from that light. In fact, he suggests, this is Moses’ desire—precisely to evoke in them a passion for seeing the face of the teacher. Like all veils, Moses’ veil hides in order to reveal.

Now He completes His answer by placing Moses in a cave from which he will indeed be denied his desire. His visual perspective will limit him to seeing “from behind”: precisely not the divine face that he desires. As a human being, he can see only obliquely; his vision is deflected. Even the crack of light in the cave will be obscured by the divine hand in the moment of passage. Paradoxically, this obscuring, protective divine hand will leave his face radiating a displaced light.

Surely the first set, written solely by the hand of God (31:18; 32:16) would have radiated a more sublime light? But that original revelation could only be seen, without being truly absorbed by the seer. Beyond full comprehension, that light remained external to Moses.

So great is the human desire to adore that the screen through which the light radiates is worshipped as the source of the light. This failure of perception leads the people to react desperately to Moses’ “delay” in returning from the mountaintop: “And the people saw that Moses was delayed . . .” (32:1). They see that if Moses fails to reappear, they will have been abandoned by the divine power that is incarnate in him. It is Moses who has brought them out of Egypt, and who has now vanished into the unknown. (“Moses, <i>the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt</i>—we do not know what has become of him.”) For them, he embodies divinity; in his absence, a substitute object must be found.

On the top of the mountain, God informs Moses what has just happened at its base: “Go on down, for <i>your people, whom you have brought out from the land of Egypt</i>, have acted basely” (32:7). God’s words take on a satirical tone. They bring Moses a dreadful revelation: in his people’s eyes, he has become an idol, his charisma symbolizing nothing other than itself. The people have known all too well exactly what they needed. He has failed to represent the infinite, to stir their imagination to thoughts of their “unattained but attainable self.” They have inflated him and at the same time vulgarized him.",

Using the same formula again, God ironically points up the essential problem.

They have not been able to bring to bear upon the image of Moses the larger resources of their own fantasy. Moses’ image fades fast.",

No time at all elapses; her husband’s image instantly fades from her mind. The midrash connects this parable with a verse from Song of Songs (“While the king still sat at his banquet, my spikenard gave forth its fragrance”), and also with a verse from Deuteronomy: “While the mountain was still blazing in fire” (9:15). While the divine is still present, the people are already hankering for another love. In the midst of the Revelation at Sinai, the people move from one passion to another.",
            "An internal state is recorded here, an intimate betrayal. The Israelites’ hunger for the omnipotent object manifests itself even while the fire of revelation still burns at Sinai.

The people may be fickle, volatile: but to God’s eye they seem all-too-constant. The paradox is intentional, provocative. Through all their feverish urgencies runs an intransigence.

This is what God said: “When you intended to sin, could you not have waited until the second or third day, that you had to start on the very first day?” R. Meir said: It did not even take one day, but while they stood at Sinai they said with their mouths, We will do and we will hear!—but their hearts were turned to idolatry, as it is said, “They seduced Him with their mouths, but their hearts were not constant to Him” (Ps. 78:36–37).</small>",
            "The people are off course from the outset. At Sinai, they mouth words of faith but their hearts are attuned to idolatrous music. Implicitly, their way of accepting divine revelation is already out of tune. It is not a matter of <i>forgetting</i> the God of Sinai; rather, the quality of their attention compromises the relationship from the beginning. It is as though the human mind flinches from the difficult freedom offered by the newly revealed God of the ancestors.",
            "Earlier in the same midrashic passage, a group of sages discusses, with strange arithmetical pedantry, the forty-day period of Moses’ absence: how many days did it take the people to go off-course? One sage proposes, “Eleven days they were <i>with</i> God, and twenty-nine days they were speculating how to make the Calf.” Another sage reverses the count: they were <i>with</i> God twenty-nine days, and eleven days they were speculating how to make the Calf. Another view has it that one day they were <i>with</i> God, yet another argues for two days. Finally, as we have seen, R. Meir arrives at the most radical conclusion: not even one day! At the very same time that they were standing at Sinai, they were already, in some sense, on the run.",
            "A darkly comic view of human nature finds expression in this version of the Golden Calf narrative. It is not a question of trying—and failing—to hold on to the impression of Sinai. Instead, standing at Sinai is a posture that compresses within it a quiver, a flinching reflex. <i>Being with God</i>, as the Torah records, is subject to seismic pulsations. They “shudder backwards” from their position at the base of the mountain: “And the people <i>saw</i> the voices and the lightning and the Shofar blast and the smoking mountain—and the people <i>saw</i>, and they shuddered backwards” (Ex. 20:18). What they see and how they see leads them to beg Moses to spare them such a direct revelation. Rashi offers a vivid midrashic reading: under the impact of each one of the Ten Commandments, they roll back from the mountain in a wave and then return to their position—twelve miles each way—which means that “standing at Sinai” involves them in convulsive rocking movements covering two hundred and forty miles!",

Essentially, God presents Himself as helpless in the face of human perversity. If He is not stopped—“Let Me be!”—He must destroy the people and create a substitute for them. In a sense, God’s counsel of despair has in it some of the “madness” that Winnicott attributes to the infant—as though God too is affected by an inability to sustain His imaginative connection to the people.

            "But at this moment Moses begins to speak: this is, in a sense, his first real speech. “Moses entreated in the presence of God His God” (32:11). The unusual verb, <i>va-yichal</i> (he entreated) is rich with associations: sickness, engendering, a vacuum, the profane. In a remarkable reading, the Talmud describes Moses as standing in prayer until <i>feverish sickness</i> grips him: “What is feverish sickness? R.

            "The Talmud is giving us entry into Moses’ inner world as he pleads for his people. We hear the <i>tone</i> of his prayer, which issues from the “fire in his bones.” He is internally on fire: a fever that commands God’s attention. But what is this fire? A brilliant psychoanalytic reading appears in the commentary of Meshech Chochma, whose thoughts on Moses as proto-idolatrous object we have cited. He suggests that at this moment Moses comes to a realization about himself: that the fire of idolatry burns in his own bones.

An unconscious desire, repressed in Moses, will come to the surface in just two generations.",
            "This elaborate rabbinic riff on Moses’ prayer—it moves from a word (<i>va-yichal</i>) to an association, to a further association, involving several different Talmudic proof-texts, to a moment of uncanny insight—has a serious point. Moses prays so passionately for his people because he realizes that he shares with them a tendency to idolatry. This is a moment of self-­ knowledge, which opens the door to a full solidarity with his people. Even on the practical level, Moses can now authentically refuse the solution that God has offered him. To destroy the people and have Moses engender a new nation would only replicate the idolatrous impulse that flesh is heir to. An intuition about his own nature profoundly links Moses with his people.",
            "One of the implications of this imaginative reading is that Moses’ “mouth is opened” by his insight. This rabbinic idiom is taken up in <i>Meshech Chochma</i>: even against God’s apparent <i>closing</i> of his mouth (“Let Me be!”), his new visceral sense of solidarity with his people—involving his very bones—opens him to effective prayer.",
            "Prayer is a function of such openings of the body and the imagination.

            "Between God and Moses, the air is full of subtle intimations and ambiguities. As in all language between people, the literal meaning of the utterance may be distant from the speaker’s intention. God says, “Let Me be,” and Moses hears, “Don’t let Me be.” God’s words, like all words, need to be <i>heard</i>: they need human interpretation. If Moses hears only God’s manifest meaning, he will be trapped in a kind of idolatry, seduced by minimum meaning. God hints that Moses is to listen differently; or rather that he is to listen as those who are involved in human dialogue listen. He is to allow God’s words to penetrate him in the infinite range of their possibility. He is to understand “in chords.” He is to bring his imagination to bear on what he hears.",
            "The power of prayer, then, is as though discovered by Moses for the first time.

Violating all theological correctness, Moses assumes outrageous authority. And R.

            "But is R. Abbahu so far off the mark when he listens in this way to what God says: “Now, just let Me be!?” In various midrashic parables, kings, even as they punish their delinquent sons, call out to their friends, “Don’t interfere!” This can mean just what it says—or just the opposite. Such moments, <i>written</i> in the text, depend on the attunement of the listener—and the reader.",
            "How does Moses know that he is to hear God in this paradoxical way? And how do the Sages of the midrash dare to read in this way? Essentially, they are reading into the text their own interpretive practice. In a later time, after prophecy has ceased, the Oral Law will engage with the text of the Torah in just such a spirit of imaginative attentiveness: acknowledging both the authority of the text and the necessity for powerful human readings. And the Sages will project their sacred practice onto the biblical figure of Moses: he is, after all, <i>Moshe Rabbenu</i>— Moses our teacher.",
            "On another level, however, the play with God’s meanings takes its authority from the ordinary use of language. If, for the first time, Moses is able to hear God in this way this is because he himself is being born into the human use of language. If he has been “heavy of tongue and heavy of mouth,” this now gives him a gravity of self-awareness as he begins to speak.",

He is to collaborate with God in attending to His true desire. God’s words open up such a possibility: “<i>Atta hanicha li—Just be Noah for Me!</i>” Moses catches the drift of God’s intention (“Don’t be like Noah!”); he brings his humanity to bear on God’s words, rather than making a fetish of them. This is the moment when Moses begins to speak, as though the fate of the world depends on him.",
            "<b><small>ICONOCLASM</small></b><br>One more fraught moment in the drama is staged at the foot of the mountain. Moses has descended, bearing in his hands the divinely inscribed Tablets. He is perhaps hopeful that he can still install these Tablets in their intended place, in the Holy of Holies, in the Tabernacle yet to be built. Stone Tablets represent fixity, continuity, the uninterrupted presence of the divine word. But, as he approaches the Israelite camp, he sees: “And he <i>saw</i> the Calf and the dancing, and Moses’ anger blazed and he threw the Tablets from his hands and smashed them at the foot of the mountain” (32:19).",

            "So he smashes the Tablets. And, according to a paradoxical midrash, God later congratulates him for his iconoclastic act.

            "For Moses himself, this iconoclastic moment takes on the deepest significance. God has already revealed to him how the people see him: “Your people whom <i>you brought out of the land of Egypt</i> have acted basely.” God bends His words ironically around the people’s view of things. For them, Moses has been first in a series of fetish figures. This realization shocks him into a new consciousness: consciousness of the human need to project, to objectify what is within; consciousness particularly of himself as both the object and, potentially, the subject of such projection. What he realizes is that anything or anyone can be pressed into service of the idolatrous impulse. This would include the God-inscribed Tablets, Moses, or the divine word. Idolatry lies in the nature of the relationship between self and object.",
            "Perhaps Moses himself, bearer of a double identity, leader of a slave people long detached from its own identity, and traumatized first by slavery and then by the rigors of freedom— perhaps he particularly feels the fire in the bones, the wish for the absolute presence of God?",
            "In fact, in the course of the Revelation at Sinai, he and the other leaders had been granted a vision of God: “They saw the God of Israel: under His feet was the likeness of a sapphire brick, like the essence of heaven for purity” (Ex. 24:10). The reader’s imagination is stalled by the mysterious detail of the imagery. Did they see the God of Israel? Or merely what was under His feet?",
            "Strikingly, Sifrei reads the “likeness of a sapphire brick” to refer to the Israelite labor with bricks and mortar in Egypt: “Throughout the duration of the slavery, the divine Presence was, as it were, enslaved <i>with</i> them.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifrei Bamidbar 84 and Sifrei Zuta to Numbers 10:35.</i> The midrash associates the sapphire brick not with sublime, ineffable realities but with the bricks of Israelite slave labor.

            "The effect of this midrash is unexpected. Instead of a vision of the transcendent God, Moses and the elders have seen something of God’s associative process, as it were: the process that leads Him to identify with human suffering. In the end, Moses is turned back to himself and his people, to the work of imagination and reflexive consciousness.",
            "Also striking is the description of the brick as only a <i>likeness—k’ma’aseh livnat ha-sapir</i>. Not a defined object but an approximation—<i>like, as though</i> . . .

Reading the word <i>anochi—I</i>—in the First Commandment (“I am God, your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt”) he points to the  letter <i>chaf</i>, which differentiates it from <i>ani</i>, the other word for <i>I</i>. This letter he calls the <i>chaf</i> of similarity, the prefix that means “like.” As in the vision on the mountain, the divine is to be seen not as something stable, rigidly defined, fully known, but as a process, a becoming, only a likeness, a provisional understanding.",
            "This letter <i>chaf</i> represents human limitation and the unfolding human capacity for understanding more and deeper. “If God had revealed Himself as <i>ani</i>, that would mean that He fully revealed His light, so that there would be no possibility of going deeper into His words.” Today’s light will tomorrow look like darkness by comparison with tomorrow’s light. Without this <i>chaf</i> of approximation, without this awareness of provisional understanding, we would have, essentially, idolatry. God, too, can be pressed into the service of the human desire for the graven image.",
            "In his imaginative, deeply serious play with the letter <i>chaf</i>, Mei HaShiloach is really talking about language, its limitation, and the need for God to undergo a <i>tzimtzum</i>: to condense the totality of revelation by introducing the provisional, the approximate into the ways He is perceived. The letter <i>chaf</i>— shaped like a cave, like a cavity, a hole—is at the heart of God’s relation with human understanding. This involves a reduction, a loss—but also invites a process of human <i>deepening</i> that is infinite, as He is infinite.",
            "Of course, the letter <i>chaf</i> also represents the <i>imaginative</i>. In the epiphany at Sinai, God acknowledges human possibilities of perception. He gives the Torah; but the real question immediately becomes one of reception. Human consciousness is constituted by the use of fantasy, which creates worlds of meaning. When truly acknowledged, fantasy can be owned in its power and its peril.",
            "The hazard of idolatry is the wish to have an object perfectly adjusted to our needs. This wish is part of the human experience of Revelation. If God is kept in mind, however, the desire, precisely, for an achieved perfection must be frustrated. In this way, we remain—always incomplete, within and without—hot in pursuit of the infinite.",
            "<b><small>BEING <i>WITH</i> GOD</small></b><br>Moses’ most intimate experience of the God of incomplete presence occurs in a “crevice” in the rock of Sinai—in a cave, a letter <i>chaf</i> carved into the mountain. “Please let me see Your glory,” he had beseeched. God had responded, “You cannot see My face, for no human being can see Me and live. . . . I will place you in a crevice in the rock and I will cover you with My hand till I have passed by. Then I will remove My hand, and you will see My back; but My face shall not be seen” (Ex. 33:20–23).",
            "This crevice in the rock, a narrow place with limited visibility, allows a mere ray of light to enter. This ray—piercing, dense—is absorbed into Moses’ face and leaves him mysteriously radiant. Even the word for “crevice,” <i>nikrah</i>, and the word for “ray,” <i>keren</i>, are anagrams, enacting the link between Moses’ radiant skin and the experience of the Cave. These rays, which at first intimidate and then attract the people, are made of pure desire, an intensity of vision that <i>sees through</i> the crack in things.",

See Or HaChaim to Ex. 32:1.</i> At that moment, he is stripped of any clear sense of his role as their leader.",
            "Reified by his people, Moses finds a way of speaking about them that expresses deeper solidarities. He moves from referring to them as “this people,” or “Your people,” to an imaginative solidarity with them: “Forgive <i>our</i> iniquity and <i>our</i> sin!” (34:9). But what sin did Moses commit?",
            "<small>“I saw that you had sinned against God your God” (Deut. 9:16). He saw that Israel had no leg to stand on, and <i>he joined his soul with them</i> and smashed the Tablets.

If you forgive them, then You can forgive me, as it is said, ‘<i>And now, if You forgive their sin</i> . . . ,’ then You can forgive my sin as well. And if not—if You do not forgive them, then don’t forgive me, but rather erase me from Your Book that You have written.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus Rabba 46:1.</i></small>",
            "In smashing the Tablets, Moses “joins his soul with them.” He finds a place where he can speak <i>with</i> and <i>for</i> them. He is inextricably bound up with them. The midrash beautifully solves the riddle of the unfinished sentence: “And now, if You forgive their sin . . .” The gap alludes to his own sin, in erasing the Tablets of the Law; this is the unspoken counterweight that Moses has added to the scales of judgment. If God does not forgive, the text continues explicitly, “then <i>erase me</i> from Your book” (Ex. 32:32). Poetic justice . . .",
            "The previous passage in the midrash compares breaking the Tablets with the act of a matchmaker who hears reports that the bride has misbehaved. He tears up the marriage document before it can be handed over to the bride. Better, Moses thinks, that she remain ignorant of the severe requirements of the Torah. In doing so, he becomes a kind of accomplice with the bride. By associating himself with her in this way, he can forcefully bargain for forgiveness.",
            "This strange solidarity, expressed through fraught images of wayward brides and ingenious matchmakers, is found in many midrashic texts. What moves Moses through his deliberately outrageous performances is a passion of solidarity that, just in this crisis, surprisingly emerges.",
            "Even more surprisingly, perhaps, God accepts Moses’ stagings of reality. By implicating himself with his people in this dramatic way, Moses is, in fact, fulfilling God’s command: <i>Lech red</i>—“Go on down, for your people . . . have acted basely” (Ex. 32:7). In moving downward, in divesting himself of his “greatness,” he joins his soul with them. At the same time, in relinquishing this greatness, he connects himself in a different way with God. All his greatness, we remember, was for his people’s sake. “Now that Israel has sinned, what are you to Me?”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">B. Brachot 32a.</i> Rather woundingly, Moses is cut loose from God, at the very moment that he realizes his isolation from his people. Reintegrating the fragments of his identity now depends on him, on his prayers, on his words. In acknowledging a new relationship with his people, he finds a way of being, precisely, <i>with</i> God.",
            "<b><small>WELCOMING THE TEACHER’S FACE</small></b><br><i>Lech red</i>—“Go on down . . .”—indicates a counterintuitive movement into the world where light comes in rays. This is a world in which much light is withheld; a world of prayer and of study of Torah. Time and change mean instability, uncertainty—and possibility: hence prayer. The study of Torah opens one to one’s unattained but attainable inner light. For this reason, when Moses relates to the people the Torah he has learned from God, his face is unveiled, momentarily revealed. It conveys the work of Torah, the intensity of desire. Hinterlands of meaning are evoked by its peculiar radiance.",
            "Strangely, Moses desires that the people should desire to gaze at his face. How is that to be understood? What is the gaze—this reflexive movement, the seer wishing to see the other’s seeing—that Moses desires? Surely not the enraptured gaze at the fascinating object, complete in itself—the graven image? But rather the gaze of the student, the face that flickers with its own process of attunement.",
            "Why does Moses desire this gaze? R. Nahman of Bratzlav, the early Hassidic master, quotes a verse from Isaiah as a key to the question: “Your eyes shall see the face of your teacher” (Isa. 30:20). A subtle transaction takes place between teacher and student. Seeing the teacher’s face means welcoming it into one’s own face, drawing in the light of his/her wisdom into one’s own face. Since the face radiates with the particular wisdom of its bearer, an idiosyncratic light transfers from face to face. This is an act of <i>kabbalat panim</i>: normally the idiom for “hospitality,” the expression is here used literally to refer to the student’s active reception of the face of the teacher. In learning Torah, one opens one’s face in a profound movement of hospitality. The teacher’s face becomes a guest in the inner world of the student. Doors are opened; a deep impress is invited. One expression accepts the imprint of another, and a spiritual “family” is created.",
            "R. Nahman’s language is one of fantasy. Faces open to other faces; light radiates and penetrates; a guest enters a host’s home. One might call this <i>metaphoric</i> language. But this would not do justice to the intimate <i>realism</i> of R. Nahman’s description. In his version of transference, playful imagery conveys the mystery of receiving Torah. The Giving of the Torah (Matan Torah) at Sinai quickly opens up to the complexity of Receiving the Torah (<i>kabbalat haTorah</i>). From now on, this will be the real issue: What does the student do with what (s)he is offered? The classic response of the people is “<i>We shall do and we shall listen!</i>”—a response of obedience and faith. But then the Golden Calf springs whole from the fire, and plays out the implicit hazards of a passive reception of Revelation. To transcend this state, active, imaginative <i>seeing</i> draws in the light of the teacher’s face.",

Rather, one hosts the light of the other so that it irradiates one’s own lights and shadows. As Cavell puts it, the thoughts of the teacher are neither exactly mine nor not mine: they represent “my further, next, unattained but attainable self.” Without that constant movement of light, desire freezes in place.",
            "What Moses’ face offers is the light that originates in the cave, the crevice in the rock. It conveys a depth of experience born of not-seeing, as God’s face passes by. The <i>nikrah</i>, the crevice, the fissure in the rock, engenders the <i>karnayim</i>, the rays of narrowed light. The wordplay expresses the force of such fragmentary light; instead of a dazzled totality, Moses’ face knows what it is to live something through to the end.",

Cavell puts it beautifully. A complete interpretation—of a text, say—would not be a matter of providing all possible interpretations, but a matter of “seeing one of them <i>through</i>.” It would mean taking the “risk implicit in the business of reading” texts or faces, of <i>reading in</i>, of <i>going too far</i>.

He is, in a sense, creating them as hosts of his light. He is imparting something of his own experience in the Cave. He is initiating them into a newly imaginative perception of <i>dibbur</i>, of language in its dynamic, shape-changing power. In seeing the traces of God’s passing, he had become aware of this power of the spiritual imagination to create the world. Now, he “transfers” this awareness to his people.

He has been preserved from the dazzle by God’s hand. In order to stage for others a similar experience—an image, an approximation—he folds back his veil. Like the great artist, he exposes his face—the after-image of an obscured revelation. Like his creator, he wants, to the depths of his being, to be known. But if the knowing can only be partial, fragmentary . . . ?",

In painting his suns, Miller suggests, Turner was enacting his own power to create a mock sun, an image that would have the same terrible power over the viewer.

            "“Wonderfully effective,” thick gobs of white paint driven by hog tools into the surface—Turner’s painting becomes itself an image of the effectual imagination which reshapes reality.

            "<b><small>IN QUEST OF BROTHERHOOD: EARLY HISTORY</small></b><br>The quest for brotherhood and the question of brotherhood pervade Moses’ early life. Both father and mother soon fall out of his story. His brother and sister, Aaron and Miriam, however, remain as both foils and mirror reflections. Moses’ singularity is perhaps best understood through his relations with those who are closest to him.",
            "It is God who definitively declares Moses’ difference from his brother and sister. Addressing their envy of him, God says: “<i>Not so [lo chen]</i> is My servant Moses!” (Num. 12:7). Miriam and Aaron and all other prophets are in one category and Moses alone in another. They may experience God in dreams and visions, but Moses alone is “faithful in all My household.” His connection with God is of a different order.",
            "The Torah, of course, ends with a similar statement about Moses’ singularity: “Never again did there arise in Israel a prophet like Moses, whom God knew face to face” (Deut. 34:10). But that “last word” of the Torah emerges from some ahistorical point: a view from nowhere. It is a metaphysical statement, detached from subjective experience. In the scene with Miriam and Aaron, however, God enters the family situation in the thick of its emotional embroilment. Moses, He says, is simply other, <i>lo chen—not so, not like</i> his siblings, not like any other prophet. His metaphysical difference begins at home, in his own family.",
            "From the beginning, Moses’ difference sets him apart. He is the child born after Pharaoh’s decree against male babies. From the moment when, at three months of age, he is cast out alone on the Egyptian river, he remains essentially alone. This, even though his sister, who is identified at first simply <i>as</i> his sister (Ex. 2:4), stands guard over him and even returns him to his mother’s breast. His infant experience, as the child of genocide, shuttled between mothers and cultures, largely obliterates his birth family from memory.",
            "One telling fact is that his parents and sister are unnamed in the early narrative; he is, in fact, the first to be named—by the Egyptian princess—after he is weaned and restored to her. In the beginning, he himself and those who figure in his early life are referred to simply as a man, a woman, a child. Relationship, therefore, and the attribution of relationship become highly significant in this narrative: Moses is repeatedly called a “child,” but Pharaoh’s daughter recognizes him as “a child of the Hebrews” (2:6). His sister proposes bringing “a woman” to nurse the child “for you”; Miriam summons the “child’s mother,” who is charged by Pharaoh’s daughter, also unnamed and always referred to in this way, with nursing “this child for me” (2:9). The woman takes the child, nurses him, and on weaning him brings him back to Pharaoh’s daughter—“And he became a <i>son to her</i>.” Her effective maternal right over him is asserted in her naming of the child: “I drew him (<i>gave birth to him</i>, in Egyptian) from the water” (2:10).",
            "The passage quietly describes the splitting of identity of a mother’s child, whose sister arranges for the ultimate re-mothering of that child, as if he were reborn. Miriam’s act is a survival response to the world of violence that is Egypt. When Moses enters conscious life, he “<i>goes out</i> to his brothers to see their sufferings” (2:11).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Vayigdal</i>—“And he grew up”—is used twice, once when he is weaned and handed back to Pharaoh’s daughter, and again when he emerges from the palace.

            "Moses’ quest is for brothers, for others who are like him. As we have noticed, it is unclear whether Moses knows the Hebrew slaves to be his brothers. Possibly, the young Egyptian prince, uneasy in his identity, emerges from the palace to look for kin in the least likely place, among the low-caste slaves. He “sees” their suffering, their labors. At the same time, he “sees” an Egyptian—who, like him, belongs to the master race—beating “one of his brothers.” The ironies multiply. The narrator refers to the slaves, factually, as “his brothers”; he himself consciously identifies at first with the Egyptian—only to find himself moved toward a sense of kinship with the one who is being beaten. Ambiguously, his brotherhood with the Hebrew slave becomes a subjective choice. It leads him to kill the Egyptian, responding to violence with violence.",
            "Strikingly, this whole early passage of his life is conducted in almost total silence. Without uttering a word, he absorbs the situation and acts.",
            "The following day, the split in identity is further complicated when he sees one Hebrew about to kill another. He cries out—his first speech: “Why would you strike your fellow?” With this outraged cry, he protests against the violence that erupts between those who are like each other, like brothers. Implicitly, he also expresses his own sense of lacking a “fellow.” His new sense of brotherhood is complicated as the “guilty one” taunts him: “Are you going to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?” Having disposed of one violent other, he discovers otherness even among the victims of violence. In a kind of “double-bind” situation, Moses is silenced. He says nothing, and flees.",
            "Silent still, he arrives at the well in Midian, saves Jethro’s daughters from the shepherds, and marries Tzippora. Then, he speaks by naming his son Gershom, “for he said, I have been a stranger in a foreign land” (2:22). Using both the words for “stranger” and “foreign,” he makes a factual observation and a reflexive one. Classically, naming a child is an opportunity for self-reflection. This is Moses’ first observation about himself.",
            "Still overwhelmingly silent, Moses arrives at the “mountain of God,” where a bush burns without being consumed. Fascinated, in soliloquy, he then says, “Let me turn aside to see this great vision” (3:3). When God calls him by name—twice— he responds, “Here I am!” But throughout God’s long speech, in which He promises salvation for “My people,” and commissions Moses as His delegate in delivering the Israelites from Egypt, Moses utters only two questions: “Who am I . . . ?” he asks (3:11); and, “If they ask me, What is His name? what should I tell them?” (3:13). Both questions express a desire to know mysteries: his own identity, God’s identity; questions within questions. But in both cases, his desire is framed by the need to explain himself to others. His concern, it seems, is largely with how he will be received by Pharaoh and by the Israelites, who now represent fragments of his split identity (his “grandfather,” Pharaoh, on the one hand, and his newly perceived brothers, on the other).",
            "Again, Moses listens silently to God’s long speech commissioning him and foretelling the narrative of the Exodus. Only in chapter 4, after a scattering of brief questions, does Moses begin to speak his mind: “They will not believe me, nor will they listen to my voice” (4:1). Repeatedly, he speaks of his inability to speak: “Please O God, I have never been a man of words, either yesterday or the day before, or now that You have spoken to Your servant; I am heavy of mouth and heavy of tongue” (4:10). In a sense, he is never as eloquent as when he invokes his speech disability, the weight he carries inside his mouth. Ironically, this is his most expressive moment so far, when he puts something of his inner life into words.",

            "In some midrashic sources, his reluctance to usurp his brother’s leadership is glowingly praised: “You find that all brothers hate one another . . .

            "God’s plan is to assign the brothers different roles that will honor Moses’ sensitivity to his brother’s role: “There is your brother Aaron the Levite—I know that he speaks with great ease.” Moses will convey God’s words to his brother who, as an eloquent speaker, will act as Moses’ mouthpiece. This plan is, in fact, carried out, when Moses later meets Aaron (4:27–31). Moses’ oedipal anxiety is relieved, and his relation with his brother becomes a model of ideal fraternity.",
            "There are, however, some significant complications in this narrative. First, strangely, when God responds to Moses’ unspoken anxiety about usurping Aaron’s role, He is described as <i>angry</i> with Moses (4:14). Second, in midrashic readings Moses is punished for resisting God: he loses the function of High Priest, which is transferred to Aaron, together with the speaking function.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the impact of God’s anger on Moses’ life: his brother, who was a simple Levite, now becomes High Priest, while Moses is demoted to simple Levite.

And third, God violently attacks Moses on his return journey to Egypt: “And it was on the road at a hotel that God encountered him and sought to kill him” (4:24).­According to midrashic tradition, the reason for the attack is Moses’ continuing resistance to God’s mission. Even though God has reassured Moses about Aaron’s reaction, Moses still maintains his posture of resistance: “Send by whose hand You will send!” (4:13). And God is angry. Moses’ reluctance to <i>speak</i>, to assert his power in voice and word, alienates him from God.",
            "The result is a lifelong preoccupation with the issues of language. In this preoccupation, his brother Aaron is deeply involved. On the face of it, the tension between them is allayed; they are to play complementary roles; fraternal aggression, the tragic subject of Genesis, gives way for the first time to brotherly love. And Moses can for the first time speak of “my brothers”: “Let me go now and return to my brothers in Egypt, and let me see if they are still alive” (4:18). But whom exactly is he referring to? His siblings Aaron and Miriam? Or the Israelites, whom he now perceives as his kin? The smaller and the larger fraternal groups are no longer objects of such anxiety. That is on the face of it. But even though Aaron has become his brother and his ally in a new and fuller sense, this, apparently, does not entirely resolve the question of Moses’ identity. He remains heavy of mouth, unable to speak. God is angry; Moses is punished by losing the High Priesthood; God attacks him on his journey back to Egypt.",
            "In the wake of Freud and other contemporary thinkers, Julia Kristeva claims that language originates in an experience of loss, the loss of “an essential object that happens to be, in the final analysis, my mother.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Julia Kristeva, <i>Black Sun</i> (New York: Columbia University Press, 1989), 43.</i> The mourner mourns the lost mother and can then recover her in symbolic language: he can speak about her. “Depressed persons, on the contrary, <i>disavow</i> the loss.” They can never reach the position of really <i>losing</i> and mourning.

The condition of <i>asymbolia</i>, the loss of symbolic meaning, writes Kristeva, manifests itself as melancholia, a “fundamental sadness.” Their language “is to them like an alien skin; melancholy persons are foreigners in their maternal tongue.

            "The melancholy subjectivity of a Moses is juxtaposed with his brother Aaron’s expressiveness. God describes Aaron as <i>dabber ye-dabber</i>, as a fluent speaker, who is “coming forth to greet you with a joyous heart.” Active, spontaneous, emotionally-integrated, Aaron will provide what Moses lacks—he will be Moses’ mouthpiece (literally, his <i>mouth</i>), while leaving Moses the role of inscrutable divinity, remote, somehow stranded.",

When, later, Aaron is in fact appointed High Priest in the Tabernacle, Moses’ reaction is deeply ambivalent. Many midrashic sources tell of his disappointment at the loss of the priestly role. Since he acts as High Priest during the seven days of inauguration, he slips so totally into his role that he is shocked when God makes it clear that he is merely to <i>dress</i> Aaron in his priestly vestments. It is Aaron who will wear those vestments, which in themselves represent expressiveness.",
            "The notion that clothes make the man dominates these biblical descriptions of the priest for whom role and clothes are equivalently effective.

God said, “I had possession of the Torah, and I gave it to you: if it were not for the Torah I should have lost My world!” This is like a wise man who married his close relative and after ten years together, when she had not borne children, he said to her, “Seek me a wife!” He said to her, “I could marry without your consent, but I seek your compliance.” So said God to Moses, “I could have made your brother High Priest without informing you, but I wish you to be great over him.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus Rabba 37:4.</i></small>",

God asks for Moses’ <i>invetanut</i>, his cooperation, his compliance in a move that undermines his own status.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The midrashic term <i>invetanut</i> derives from <i>anav</i>, humble, which the Torah, in a rare moment of explicit portrayal, describes as Moses’ dominant characteristic: “Moses was a very humble man, more so than any man on earth” (Num. 12:3). The midrashic narrative focuses on a specific moment when Moses demonstrates his greatness in an act of humility in relation to his brother Aaron.</i> A pang of loss initiates him into conscious mourning.",
            "The wife’s humility/compliance becomes, in the narrative of God and Moses, a demand that “you be great over him.” The apparent dissonance between humility and greatness becomes the central tension of the midrash: compliance, forbearance, will be renamed as greatness. In the relation of Moses and Aaron, Aaron is the older, the “greater” in age—and therefore, in power. He is to be High Priest, literally, the <i>Great</i> Priest. But Moses’ compliance becomes an enigmatic form of greatness.",
            "And yet, Moses’ sense of injury is justified. He had some right to expect that the High Priestly role would be his. Perhaps in light of the paradigms of Genesis, the notion of primogeniture overturned has become a new convention: the younger brother proves himself to be the child of destiny and supersedes the older, the “greater.” Abel, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph are the most prominent examples. Moreover, as the recipient of all God’s instruction about the Tabernacle, Moses is justified in expecting to become the prime actor within its precincts. The shock of exclusion, therefore, represents a reversion to the original typology, to the domination of the elder brother.",
            "Another midrash refines and sharpens the point. At Moses’ first encounter with God at the Burning Bush, God had addressed him: “Moses! Moses! . . . Do not come closer . . .” (Ex.3:4–5):",
            "<small>And he replied, “Here I am!” . . . “Here I am, ready for priesthood and for kingship! . . .” God replied, “Do not approach closer—that is, your children will not offer sacrifices (lit., bring close to Me), because the priesthood is reserved for Aaron your brother . . . and the kingship for King David.” And yet Moses attained both: the priesthood, when he officiated during the seven days of Inauguration of the Tabernacle, and the kingship, as it is written, “Then he became King in Jeshurun” (Deut. 33:5).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus Rabba 2:13.</i></small>",
            "The ground on which the midrashic theme is based is the phrase, <i>Al tikrav halom</i>—“Do not come closer.” This kind of intimacy, the offering of sacrifices—<i>hakrava</i>, bringing close— is not your prerogative. “<i>Your children</i> will not offer sacrifices”: it is the hereditary nature of the priesthood that disqualifies Moses—just as the first wife’s infertility is the reason for the second marriage. Moses loses the priesthood—although he himself does perform the role during the Inauguration of the Tabernacle—because he lacks some reproductive capacity. (It is striking that Moses’ biological children are not his spiritual heirs. They play no role in the history of the Exodus or in the wilderness.)",
            "Moses cannot “propagate” his connection to God; he cannot reproduce himself. Like the wife in the midrash, he is “close” to God, he has a natural affinity with the divine, but this kind of affinity does not lend itself to replication.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Sefat Emet Likkutim, Exodus, Tetzaveh.</i> Moses’ encounter with the divine is perhaps by its very nature inimitable. Mystical sources read the expression, “man of God” (Deut. 33:1), as referring to an intimate erotic relation that transcends transmission or propagation.",
            "Moses’ “infertility” becomes the ground for denying him the High Priesthood. But why is Moses surprised when God tells him to “bring Aaron close” into this dynastic role? If he knows from his encounter with God at the Burning Bush that, despite his “readiness,” he will be disqualified for the priesthood, how can he be disappointed when the moment of inauguration arrives? A disappointment that is expected is not exactly a disappointment! But at the later moment, as in the parable of the abandoned wife, a theoretical knowledge becomes shockingly real and immediate. It is as though Moses has “forgotten” God’s warning at the Burning Bush. His amnesia is disrupted when God uses the same word <i>hakrev</i>—“Bring him close!”—as He had used at the Burning Bush. Earlier, Moses had repressed his experience of loss, and therefore he had not mourned the loss. Now, what he has known from the beginning is reenacted in all its fullness.",
            "In Moses’ life, a kind of amnesia makes its appearance more than once. Repeatedly, he seems both to know and not to know of an essential loss. Midrashic versions of Moses’ life repeatedly bring to light this dynamic of forgetting and remembering. Toward the end of the forty-year journey in the wilderness, for instance, God abruptly decrees that Moses will not consummate his journey by leading his people into the Land. This tragic declaration is made in mysterious circumstances, after Moses has struck the rock at Meriva to produce water for his people: “Because you have not trusted Me to sanctify Me before the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this community into the land which I have given them” (Num. 20:12). Clearly, this is a shocking moment for Moses and Aaron. And yet, according to midrashic sources, Moses had been told from the beginning of the story that he would not lead the people to their destination.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Rashi to Ex. 6:1.</i> Again, the same dynamic: the present crisis catalyzes an old, suspended knowledge of loss.",
            "A repressed memory is rearranged, rewritten under the vital impact of present knowledge. Freud named this dynamic <i>Nachträglichkeit</i>. Perhaps all these obscured traumas of Moses’ life gesture toward a primal loss that has never been fully acknowledged? In psychoanalytic terms, it is the loss of the mother that forms the primal stratum, forgotten and re-transcribed, of experience. The loss of the mother, quite literally in Moses’ case, engenders in him a continual quest for echoes of that loss.",
            "<b><small>The Crown of Torah</small></b><br>In the midrash about the compliant wife, God consoles Moses for the loss of the High Priesthood. He names his compensation <i>Torah</i>, which saves the world from extinction: “I had possession of the Torah, and I gave it to you: if it were not for the Torah I should have lost My world!” In other words, Moses, who lacks the reproductive capacity that biologically preserves the human race, is endowed with another world-preserving capacity. Playing on a verse from Psalms (“If Your Torah had not been my play, I should have perished in my poverty” [Ps. 119:92]), God tells Moses: “If it were not for the Torah, which I have given you, <i>I</i> should have lost <i>My</i> world!”",
            "The divine world is the world of <i>play with Torah texts</i>. Moses becomes the prototype of those who engage in this divine play, separating words and letters and connecting them in different formations. His role is of incomparable significance. It involves losses, gestures of compliance that are read as gestures of spontaneous greatness. Generic rather than genetic, Moses’ role is seen in later texts as representing the ongoing generativity that preserves God’s world.",
            "Moses’ place in this world is nevertheless enigmatic. At the moment when he is told to yield place to his brother, the Torah has God address him with the emphatic pronoun <i>Ve-atta: “As for you</i>, bring close your brother . . .” This emphatic address is repeated several times in the immediate context—three times within five verses (Ex. 27:20; 28:1, 3) We would normally expect <i>Ve-atta</i> to set up a contrast with another subject. Here, since Moses is the subject of the entire passage, it is not clear why the text targets him at this point.",
            "Ironically, too, the Torah portion in which the triple address occurs is the only one in which Moses’ name is entirely absent. A tension forms between absence and emphatic presence: a moment of loss and gain. Just where Moses is asked to comply in yielding his brother the dignities of a dynastic role, God insists on the intimate invocation: “Now you . . . you . . . you.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A similar tension of presence and absence is found in the liturgical timing of the Torah portion, which is usually read in the week when 7 Adar occurs—the date of Moses’ birth and death. A mythic birth-death theme haunts Moses’ life.</i>",
            "A quiet pulse sounds within the text that celebrates Aaron’s official inauguration. God has apparently shifted the center of gravity away from Moses to Aaron. Moses is left with a merely instrumental role. But the pulse of <i>Ve-atta</i> evokes a new kind of power. The balance of forces is subtly re-centered. Losses and gains shift their meanings.",
            "Moses is asked to accept—like the compliant wife—a place of distance and loneliness, in which he will re-create union in the mode of play. Surrendering the priestly garments, which speak the language of representation—public, ceremonious, relatively static—Moses is to create a <i>playful</i> language—in fact, a poetic language. “If Your Torah had not been my play (<i>sha’ashua</i>), I should have perished in my poverty.”",
            "This <i>sha’ashua</i>, this playfulness, is entirely serious work: God’s world depends on it. The poet plays in the space that John Keats names <i>negative capability</i>: “where a man is capable of being in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Keats, <i>Letters</i> (London: Oxford University Press, 1954), 53.</i> In this space, one is capable of eluding rigid forms; one moves into and out of many roles.

            "The culture of <i>sha’ashua</i> arises precisely when law is crystallized, transmitted in written or engraved form, when the creative surge seems frozen in place. This is a moment of danger, when God’s world becomes brittle. In the view of a number of commentators, while the formalism and ceremoniousness of the priesthood is given to Aaron, Moses becomes the agent of that different valence of spirituality that will be called the Oral Torah, the Torah of the Mouth.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ha’amek Davar, Sefat Emet, Pri Tzaddik. Moses, the <i>non-speaker</i>, is both the passive medium registering God’s Torah and, in these commentaries, the creator of <i>Torat Moshe</i>—Moses’ Torah—the product of intellectual labor and creativity. Mystical traditions lie behind these retellings of Moses’ story.</i>",
            "Moses becomes the type of those who generate complex, irreducible interpretations, poems in themselves. His special responsibility will be the olive oil for the Menorah, the candelabrum in the Tabernacle. R. Naftali Tzvi Yehuda Berlin of Volozhin (known as the <i>Ha’amek Davar</i>) discusses the “wondrous” symbolic power of the Menorah; its seven branches and its elaborate knobs and blossoms suggest a fantastic beauty of wisdom and ingenuity.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ha’amek Davar</i> cites R.

            "In this view, Moses’ genius is quite different from that of Aaron. His is the “crown of Torah,” which, unlike the crown of priesthood, or the crown of royalty, is not hereditary. It is, according to Maimonides, potentially accessible to every Jew: “Whoever wishes may come and take of it!” Democratic in essence, its authority transcends and is the source of the authority of the other two crowns. Moses-figures, in every generation, move beyond fixed forms of understanding toward new combinations of words that, Godlike, create worlds.",
            "Who is the Moses who emerges from this portrait of brotherhood? He is the man without fixed identity—in a sense, childless; in a sense, parentless; child of two cultures, Hebrew and Egyptian, and marginal, in a sense, to both. He cannot, at first, find himself in any language. A protean figure, he wears many crowns, but he is absorbed into no single role. Neither priest nor king, he will know both crowns. Momentarily absent from the text, he is yet pervasive. He is the other, who expresses what the structures repress.",
            "His project is the discovery of a voice that is uniquely his, “for the sake of Israel.” He is to be God’s second-person address. He is to respond to his brother with a magnanimous imagination. “As you live,” he says, in another midrash, “even though you have become High Priest, it is <i>as though</i> I had become High Priest!”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tanchuma Shemini, 3.</i> A metaphoric genius allows him to lose the hard casing of selfhood in acts of imaginative power.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In this “chameleon” mode, Moses reminds us of John­Keats’s description of the “poetical Character . . . which has no self—it is everything and nothing. . . .

As in most processes, there are points of strain. The midrash allows us to glimpse an intimate narrative of becoming, with its anger and melancholy, as well as its luminous harmonies.",
            "<b><small>2. MIRIAM</small><br>Secret Meanings</b><br>There is yet another dramatic confrontation between Moses and Aaron, this time together with their other sibling Miriam. In this mysterious episode, narrated in Numbers 12, Miriam and Aaron speak against Moses—<i>be-moshe</i>—protesting his singular claims to prophecy: “Is it only <i>be-moshe</i>, through Moses, that God has spoken? Has He not spoken through us too?” (Num. 12:1–2). Moses becomes an object of envy within his own family. Miriam, who is the moving spirit of this conflict, is afflicted with leprosy and isolated from the camp, until the seven-day quarantine period is over.",
            "The central issue of the narrative is Moses’ difference from all other prophets, including his own siblings. To Miriam, particularly, this difference looks like arrogance: God has spoken <i>through</i> her and <i>through</i> Aaron in the same way as <i>through Moses</i>. God’s answer is trenchant: <i>Lo chen—“Not so—not like others</i>—is My servant Moses!” (12:7). Moses is a world of his own, fundamentally different from all other prophets. It is not arrogance but, strangely, humility that characterizes him in his difference (12:3).",
            "Difference and sameness: within his own family, Moses lives in the eye of that storm. In Miriam, particularly, midrashic sources trace currents of feeling that run deep: they detect a sexual motif in her protest. Drawing on the mysterious reference to a “Cushite woman whom he had married” (12:1), Rashi tells a story of a separation, rather than a marriage: Moses had <i>separated</i> from his wife Tzippora (here called the Cushite woman), abstaining from sexual relations because of the demands of his prophetic condition.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi engages in elaborate wordplay to make the identification of the Cushite woman. The general gist is that Tzippora is beautiful, inside and out, so that the only reason for Moses’ abstinence is the consuming nature of his prophecy.</i> In this reading, Miriam’s envy is complicated by her conviction that there need be no tension between sexuality and prophetic experience. She and Aaron have received prophecy without interrupting their sexual lives. Miriam comes to know about Moses’ private life and sharply protests against his celibate state.",
            "In the midrashic narratives, as recounted by Rashi, secret meanings subvert the apparent narrative. Miriam is aggrieved not at Moses’ marriage, but at his separation from his own wife. I suggest that when she protests against his splitting between sexual and prophetic experience, she draws on the origins of her relationship with him. We remember that when she first appears in the biblical narrative, she is holding vigil over her baby brother, who floats in a box, a basket, on the Egyptian river. In the event, she restores the infant Moses to his own mother’s breast, until he is weaned. Miriam is a maternal surrogate, enabling the physical reunion of mother and child. Why, in this moment of danger, does she play the maternal role?",
            "Midrashic traditions fill in a backstory. Miriam’s special connection with Moses begins before his birth. At the height of the Egyptian genocide, when baby boys were to be thrown into the river, Miriam’s father separated from his wife. Miriam then confronted her father with her conviction that he is doing Pharaoh’s work: “Your decree is harsher than Pharaoh’s: he decreed against male children, while your decree prevents any child from being born!”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus Rabba 1:17.</i> In response to her protest, her parents reunite and Moses is born.",
            "This midrashic narrative positions Miriam as the daughter who makes possible the birth of her younger brother. She is, in a sense, a co-mother; her critique of sexual separation brings Moses into the world. Her relation with her younger brother is, therefore, unusually intense and complex. And years later, when that brother separates from his wife, her passion for connection is again aroused.",
            "The moment of confrontation with her father, the man of “decrees,” is recorded in the midrash as her moment of prophecy.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Gezera</i>—“decree”—derives from the root <i>g-z-r</i>, which means “cutting.” The decree implies incisive separation, exclusion of the forbidden.</i> But this moment is unrecorded in the biblical text; it is celebrated cryptically, years later, at the Red Sea, when she is given the title “Miriam the prophetess, Aaron’s sister” (Ex. 15:20). “When did she prophesy?” asks Rashi. “When she was <i>Aaron’s sister</i>, before Moses was born!” She prophesied the birth of Moses who would redeem the Israelites from Egypt; and then, in the lonely force of her prophetic vision, she stood guard over his basket in the river. Standing “at a distance,” she is alienated from her own family, who now doubt her prophecy.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus Rabba 1:25.</i> Shamed, excluded, her prophecy in question, she bears it staunchly within her like a pregnancy, waiting to know its outcome.",
            "In this powerful midrashic narrative, Miriam is the type of the courageous but despised prophet. This is the moment when she moves from being “Aaron’s sister” to being most truly <i>Moses’</i> sister (2:4). This moment is deeply implanted within her. It will emerge later in two different forms. When she leads the women in song and dance at the sea, the text refers to her as Miriam <i>the prophetess</i>; and when she speaks <i>against</i> Moses, God declares judgment on her, shaming her: “If her father spat in her face, would she not bear her shame for seven days? Let her be shut out of the camp for seven days, and then let her be readmitted” (Num. 12:15). Strangely, her early history of prophecy is reenacted when God quarantines her; again, her Father puts her at a distance. The Talmud notices another link between the two episodes: “As she waited for Moses [in his basket in the river], so Israel waited for her in the wilderness.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">B. Sotah 9b.</i>",
            "Alienation and solitude, a father who shames her, a people that gathers her in—at the heart of Miriam’s drama is her fraught relation with her brother Moses, which continues throughout her life. Her prophetic role in bringing him into the world endangers her position in her family; as Moses’ sister, she risks her identity as her father’s daughter. Then, her little brother grows bigger and eclipses her. Her prophecy ceases; his begins and flourishes.",
            "But the main characteristic of her relation with Moses is suggested by the ambiguous preposition <i>be</i>—“against” and “through”—that throbs through the later story of envy. Miriam and Aaron <i>speak against</i> Moses; and they protest, “Is it only <i>through</i> Moses (<i>be-moshe</i>) that God has <i>spoken</i>? Has He not also <i>spoken through</i> us (<i>banu</i>)!” The same preposition is used with different meanings: it expresses an adversary relation, a targeted aggressiveness; and it expresses the inward experience of prophecy—God’s <i>speaking in</i> or <i>through</i> a person, in a vision or a dream. When God explains Moses’ difference, He uses the same preposition in the same two senses: “Mouth to mouth, I <i>speak through</i> him! . . . Why have you not been afraid to <i>speak against</i> My servant, <i>against</i> Moses?” (12:8). The text then sums up this section of the narrative: “God’s anger burned <i>against</i> them.”",
            "What emerges from this use of the preposition is the intensity of a relationship that is both hostile and deeply empathic. Projection and envy are the shorthand terms for this complexity. Miriam knows what it is to have God speak through her, and she desires to be again a vessel for divine inspiration. In her fantasy, she is merged with Moses, the brother she has “mothered” into the world. It is inconceivable that her vision, in which the sexual and the spiritual are fused, should be different from that of Moses. She speaks, therefore, in and through his imagined world, and against the sexual separation by which Moses expresses his singularity. What bond could be deeper than the bond between this sister-mother and this brother-child? But for him separation from his wife is God’s will, and God acknowledges his intuition. His relation with God is unique and all-consuming—<i>peh el peh</i>, mouth to mouth.",
            "God too speaks in the language of double meanings, picking up the ambiguity of Miriam’s use of <i>be</i>-, even as His anger burns against—and within—her. Aaron, praying for his sister, touches off similar depths as he speaks of the shared, half-consumed flesh of siblings: “Let her not be as one dead, who emerges from his mother’s womb with half his flesh eaten away!” (Num. 12:12). If Moses’ sister, who has come forth from the womb of his mother, is afflicted with leprosy, then it is as though half his flesh, too, is consumed.",
            "The macabre image conveys Aaron’s understanding of the intimate connection between Miriam and Moses. All three siblings emerged from the same womb—and siblings are one flesh.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“He is our brother, our flesh,” Judah says of Joseph (Gen. 37:27).</i> But Aaron speaks of <i>his</i> (Moses’) mother’s womb, and of <i>his</i> flesh alone.

They emerged from their mother’s womb in a unique sense: for Miriam, by reuniting her parents, had brought that womb back into the world of possibilities.",
            "The primal connection created by the flesh and the imagination of those who emerge from the same womb is expressed in unusually charged language. Aaron is here entering into the private world of meanings that is shared by Miriam and Moses. And Moses responds with the briefest, convulsive prayer—“God, please, heal her please!”—from his own flesh, a cry stronger than empathy.",
            "<b><small>Singularity and Solidarity</small></b><br>Moses’ position in this story is harder to detect than that of his passionate sister. Throughout the episode, except for his prayer, Moses is silent. It is God who “hears” the implications of Miriam and Aaron’s complaint. At this point, Moses is described: “the man Moses was very humble, more than any other human being on the face of the earth” (12:3). God then speaks about Moses’ singularity. How are we to imagine Moses’ personal reaction to the family drama of love and envy in which he is involved? Is he impervious to the question of his difference? Do his siblings’ grievances affect him?",
            "The question touches on the issue of brotherhood, in the most personal way. Every time God uses the expression, “your brother Aaron,” it holds emotional meaning for the man who had two mothers and two mother tongues, the Egyptian prince whose brothers are slaves. When God describes the forthcoming original encounter of the brothers, He declares, “Here is Aaron your brother the Levite—I know that he is a ready speaker. Even now, he is setting out to meet you, and when he sees you he will rejoice in his heart” (Ex. 4:14). This relation, in its complementarity, is to embody and transcend the tension of brotherhood. But when his brother and sister attack him for not being identical with them, his separateness is reaffirmed. At this juncture, what does his silence say?",
            "On the one hand, God, in a sense, speaks for him, when He characterizes him as uniquely “<i>ne’eman</i>, faithful, trustworthy, in all My household” (Num. 12:7). The nineteenth-century Hassidic master, Sefat Emet, interprets this difference of Moses: <i>ne’eman</i>, he suggests, means stable, unchanging. All other prophets are transfigured by the prophetic experience. They are ecstatic, beyond themselves: “their faces would flame like torches.” Moses alone remains constantly attuned to the wavelengths of the divine. “Mouth-to-mouth” expresses an intimacy without ebbs and flows, in which his true nature remains unchanged. His sexuality is sublimated in <i>devekut</i>, a passionate but <i>even</i> intimacy with God.",
            "This reading imagines Moses’ unique way of living as a man who is “the man of God.” It speaks of a kind of detachment from the tides of human emotion. But in this incident with his sister, Aaron calls on his solidarity, his brotherly attunement with Miriam. For the first time, Moses confronts his uneasiness with differences and distances, with the need to negotiate the gaps between himself and others. Even with those who are closest to him, in whom he finds the most poignant reminder of the womb that bore them, there arises that uneasiness. With Miriam, his sister-mother, who finds his difference unthinkable, things fall apart.",
            "He prays for her as “half his flesh.” But something new emerges in Moses in this crisis. Being the same and not the same as his sister becomes for Moses a clue to the mystery of brotherhood. Imagining himself as the one who is envied, he is brought up against his own singularity, as well as his womb-­ identity with his siblings.",
            "A short time before this, Moses had cried to God about the paradox of his own identity: “Did I conceive this people, did I give birth to it, that You should say to me, Carry it in your bosom, as the wet nurse carries the suckling child—to the land that You swore to its fathers?” (Num. 11:11–12). Using imagery that expresses an inexpressible frustration, he imagines himself as mother to his people, to his brothers. There is a violence in his cry: How can he carry this people in his bosom, as though he had been impregnated with them, had given birth to them, had become their male wet nurse? The demand made on him by God is ultimately a demand that he <i>speak</i> to them; and he is as unequipped for that role, as a man is unequipped to conceive, give birth, and suckle. To speak to them, he imagines, would mean to <i>hold</i> them, to be entirely present to their needs, to be penetrated by them, even, like Miriam, to give birth to them.",
            "Unlike a mother, or a wife, he is not flesh of their flesh. And yet his imagination dwells on feminine images of nurturance, of deepest connection, of <i>trustworthiness</i> in relation to the people. To be an <i>omen</i>, a male wet nurse, would be to display in his relation to them the same unchanging stability, the same availability, as God celebrates in the related term <i>ne’eman</i>. The demand is that he be constantly attuned to the wavelengths of his people as he is to those of his God. The <i>devekut</i>, the passionate intimacy of motherhood, (ideally) without ebbs and flows, is imaginatively present to him. Womb and breasts are implicitly grafted on, as the man Moses imagines the totally unacceptable. In some way, God seems to demand a feminization of his masculine self.",
            "His cry is an utterance that refers to a performative possibility. If he had said, “I conceived this people, I gave birth to it. . . ,” this would have met the conditions that the British philosopher J. L.

L. Austin, <i>How to Do Things with Words</i> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1970).</i> Examples of the performative utterance include, “I promise,” “I bet,” “I bequeath,” “You are sanctified to me.” Moses, on the other hand, <i>undoes</i> a possible world at the same time that he alludes to it. His cry is, in a sense, more potent than an explicit performative utterance. It evokes the pathos of uncertainty about what he might become capable of. It perpetuates the prestige of pregnancy, birth, and suckling, while creating a penumbra of different ways of imagining it.",
            "Moses’ outburst, which ends in a death wish (11:15), gives voice to ambiguities of sameness and otherness that at first trouble him like a loss of personal power.

Korach defies the leadership of Moses and Aaron: “You have gone too far! For all the community are holy, all of them, and God is in their midst. Why then do you raise yourselves above God’s congregation?” (Num. 16:3). The rebels’ claim sounds appealingly democratic. Moses “falls on his face” on hearing it.",
            "However, beneath the political surface of the narrative a different confrontation is taking place. Korach and Moses are first cousins, mirror images, each inviting the other to greater self-knowledge. In this sense, they are like the sibling couples we have discussed: Moses and Aaron, Moses and Miriam. Here, too, the issue is the tension around sameness and difference. Korach speaks a rhetoric of totality: “<i>All</i> the community are holy, <i>all</i> of them . . .” Oceanic holiness is the condition of the people, without nuance or conflict or difference. This claim contains enough truth to be persuasive: the camp of Israel is <i>potentially</i> holy, and its symbolic center is the Tabernacle with God inhabiting its recesses.

But, we may remember, Moses has a particular reason to be pained by such an experience. In terms of his personal history, when his overtures fall on deaf ears, his worst fears are fulfilled. At the Burning Bush, at the very beginning of his mission, he had shied away from God’s call with the words: “But they will not believe me, they <i>will not listen to my voice</i>, they will say: God never appeared to you!” (Ex. 4:1). Pleading his inability to make the people listen to him, he went on to use idioms and metaphors to convey his rejection of God’s mission: “Please, O God, I have never been a man of words, neither yesterday nor the day before, nor now that You have spoken to Your servant; I am heavy of speech and heavy of tongue” (4:10). “Moses spoke to God, saying, ‘The Israelites would not listen to me; how then should Pharaoh listen to me, a man of uncircumcised lips!’” (6:12).",

            "God responds in an unexpected way to Moses’ complaint at the Burning Bush. Instead of reassuring him, promising him communicative power, God asks a question: “What is that in your hand?” This is the scene that follows:",

            "Instead of healing Moses of his oral dread, God enacts with him the very experience, in the flesh, of his dread. The rod in his hand is no sooner named as such than it becomes a snake—“And Moses fled from it.” An object that has just emerged from his own body, a safe, definable object, which was, in a sense, a symbolic extension of the power of his hand, now arouses in him an uncontrollable, visceral fear. In an instant, as it leaves his hand, it becomes unrecognizable, terrifying. Then, at God’s command, he overcomes his fear and grasps the snake, which re-transforms in his hand into a rod. “This is the first sign,” designed to create belief in the Israelites (4:8); but a sign, as well, to himself, a staging of his own fear of that which emerges from his body and can no longer be mastered.",

Both signs reenact the trauma of the act of speech: the movement from an interior to an exterior world, and the dread of what cannot be controlled in that communication. In speaking, in meeting the other, there is sacrifice, there is transformation, even a fantasy of losing oneself.

Clearly, if the baby Moses is to be saved from the fate of Israelite male infants, some provision will have to be made for feeding him.

Here, the double sense of orality is explicit: the mouth that will speak with God cannot feed from impure breasts. The basic oral impulse—to feed—is in this child inhibited at the earliest stage. Fraught with his future, precociously dedicated to an ultimate conversation, he cannot inhabit his body, reach beyond its edges with full spontaneity. Even when he is reunited with his mother, she nurses him in a double role—as his mother and as the princess’s surrogate.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The idiom, <i>le-hanik le</i> . . .

The bizarre image of Moses as failed male wet nurse suggests a deep frustration, a yearning for a simpler, more organic world of connection. Wishing and fearing to feed, to be fed, to speak, to evoke response, Moses knows the traumatic gap that makes <i>dibbur</i>, the human speech function, a zone of vulnerability.",

Twice, Seforno uses the word <i>k’eelu</i> (“as if”) about Moses’ way of using language. “You are mocking us, playing with us,” they claim.

To recover language from the repressed state she calls asymbolia, one needs to lose, to experience a void, a break, a renunciation.

            "There is a rupture in human experience—a crack in the cup—which generates this yearning; desire builds toward a transcendent source of grace—<i>hessed</i>—such as the Sabbath. The inherent turbulence of the world is exposed at the very moment when creation is completed, in the twilight moment before Shabbat. At this moment of greatest tension, “between the suns,” the demons of chaos (<i>mezikin</i>—destructive angels, as Sefat Emet calls them) are aroused and, with the onset of Shabbat, laid to rest. The world is made whole for the Shabbat moment.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leonard Cohen writes of this moment: “Ring the bells that still can ring / Forget your perfect offering / There is a crack, a crack in everything / That’s how the light gets in” (“Anthem”).</i>",
            "Here, Sefat Emet brings us back to the Korach narrative. In this primal twilight, “the mouth of the earth (<i>pi ha’aretz</i>) was created.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Pirkei Avot 5:8.</i> This is the crack into which Korach and his followers vanish. It represents all the <i>chissaron</i>—the fracture in the world—that Korach set himself to deny. Demonic forces take their revenge on him for his manic rationality. He has closed out the dynamic of longing that lives in language. He has lost the sense of the gaps and edges of human experience, and with it the ability to be permeated by infinity. Like a stone, he sinks into silence.",
            "<b><small>Conclusive Meaning: The Mouth of the Earth</small></b><br>In bearing witness to Korach, Sefat Emet is also implicitly telling us about the different history of Moses. For Moses too, we have suggested, knows about the fantasy world of totality. For him it is perhaps more real than for any other human being. And yet he is moved toward others, toward Israel, toward himself, across the gaps. Increasingly, he comes to know that he was born into the cracked world in order to let light in. Language will be necessary, even a source of blessing, if he can find the stammering voice with which to speak.",
            "The final scene, the showdown between Moses and Korach, is initiated by Moses’ speech of warning:",
            "<small>By this you shall know that it was God who sent me to do all these things; that they were not of my own devising [lit., not from my heart]: if these men die as all men do, if their lot be the common fate of all mankind, it was not God who sent me. But if God brings about something unheard-of [lit., if God creates a new creation], so that the ground opens its mouth and swallows them up with all that belongs to them, and they go down alive into Sheol, you shall know that these men have spurned God. (Num. 16:28–30)</small>",
            "More than a warning, this speech is Moses’ theological confrontation with the rebels. It is about God and revelation and difference. Mostly, it is about knowledge: the approaching cataclysm will make the truth of their history apparent. And indeed, “The ground under them burst asunder, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up” (16:31–32). The text insists on the grotesque oral imagery of Moses’ scenario. That the ground bursts asunder and the rebels go down to the underworld is apparently not sufficient to convey the scene. The earth must become a maw yawning wide, swallowing up its victims. When does this moment of oral horror arrive? With precision, the narrative presents the timing: “Scarcely had he finished speaking all these words . . .” (16:31).",
            "When Moses stops speaking, when he closes his mouth, the earth opens up its mouth and swallows. Speaking and eating— two oral functions—are in tension. As long as Moses speaks, the mouth of the earth remains closed. When it opens, it is not to speak but to consume. The terrible alternative to spoken words is the cataclysm of final and irrefutable revelations. Moses had, as it were, <i>exhausted</i> (<i>k’chaloto . . . et kol ha-devarim</i>) all the resources of language, so that nothing remained but the brute apocalypse. The limitation of human language, indeed, is that words can never achieve that finality, the <i>last word</i>, of the consuming earth. Moses speaks to the very last moment, in order, in a sense, to hold an option open. Orality is at issue here. Moses speaks not only to warn but also to exercise the power of language, to keep worlds in play. When he closes his mouth, the earth opens its mouth to devastating effect.",
            "In this horrifying scene, Moses stands at the very edge of the pit. When it yawns open and closes over the dead, something conclusive has happened. The truth of Moses’ story has been manifested. But this is a situation of final resort. With what feelings does Moses—and those like him who inhabit the difficult ground of language at the edge of the pit—view the closure of the story? The scenario seems to be his idea, since there is no mention of a command from God. Perhaps the apocalyptic scene represents his sense of the limits as well as the power of language. Once again, his early anxiety about not being <i>heard</i> is vindicated. Language displays its ultimate weakness. He is heard by God but not by the people. In the end, only the blatant theatricality of the earth’s mouth can bring the rebellion to an end.",
            "<b><small>The Paradox of Song</small></b><br>But the rabbinic sages will not allow the matter to rest there.

            "Here, we return to Moses, whose own history includes the paradox of song. It is, again, Sefat Emet, who spoke of the crack through which grace may enter, who draws our attention to Moses’ song-moment at the Red Sea: <i>Az yashir moshe</i>—“Then Moses sang/would sing . . .” (Ex. 15:1).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sefat Emet, Vayikra (Pesach), 79.</i> Rashi reads the unusual future-tense narrative form as a moment of intentionality: “Then there came up in his mind the intention to sing a song.” He also quotes the midrashic reading: “This is a biblical reference to the revival of the dead!” Sefat Emet comments: what Moses actually sings is that part of his internal song that lends itself to the words of the world. But a residue remains within, the fantasy of praise that cannot pass—<i>not yet</i>—the barrier of consciousness. This unconscious life is what the midrash refers to when it says that the text hints at the resurrection of the dead. Then, infinite desires, expressed only in fragmentary ways in this world, will find full expression. This is the intention that comes up in Moses’ mind.",
            "Beyond the words of the song that Moses authors, there is the residue of what cannot yet be sung. “Not yet” sustains the intuition of ultimate possibility. Moses’ intention of a future song emerges from his specific experience of speechlessness and song. Beyond his relation with his cousin Korach, there are songs that will yet find words: Korach’s sons will sing, and Moses’ song will redeem death itself."

            "This reflexivity gives new voice to Moses’ inner world. More precisely, it gives voice to the intersubjective world created between himself and his people. In finding words for his report, he to some extent creates what previously had been only dimly known. As spoken autobiography, his final speeches to his people bring his relation with them into full being.",

            "In this vein, he tells his people of the occasion when he said to them, “I can no longer bear you alone. . . . How can I bear unaided the trouble of you, the burden, and the resentments!” (Deut. 1:9, 12). Moses’ complaint had resulted in the formation of a bureaucratic system to deal with the disputes of a contentious people. But this pragmatic outcome does not exhaust the possible meanings of his complaint. When he recounts the crisis, we hear the pathos of his repeated <i>levadi—on my own, alone</i>—and of his sense of bearing an impossible burden. The imagery of weight-bearing, as of a physical strain, conveys the intimate reality of his experience, as a body responsible for other bodies.",
            "We are reminded of the beginning of the wilderness journey and of his extraordinary metaphor of the pregnant, birthing, and nursing woman: “Was I impregnated with all this people? Did I give birth to them?—that You should tell me, Carry them in your bosom, as a nursing father carries a suckling child . . . ?” (Num. 11:12). Turning to God in bitter complaint, imagining himself as a woman straining under the burdens of her biological role, Moses conveys the experience of the female body given over to the lives of others. He imagines his body changed to accommodate a relationship that is not only unbearable but also unthinkable. He addresses his protest to God, who has imposed this bizarre role upon him: “Why have You done evil to Your servant . . . that You have laid the burden of all this people upon me?” (11:11). Then, God responds by having Moses appoint seventy elders to share the administrative burden.",
            "In his last speeches, however, Moses addresses the people, re-evoking his lonely, visceral resistance to the burden of them. Here, God plays no role: it is Moses who proposes a system whereby “wise, perceptive, and distinguished men” deal with their more immediate issues.",
            "But a different reading of this speech emerges if we imagine Moses as recounting his past complaint with an implicit present demand. What moves him, at this moment, to recall that past moment? How is his present <i>I</i> (“I said to you at that time”) different from the past <i>I</i> (“I can no longer bear you alone! . . . How can I bear unaided the trouble of you . . . ?”)",
            "In a poignant Hassidic reading, Mei HaShiloah suggests that Moses is now appealing to his people to acknowledge a past failure. This was a failure in “emotional intelligence.” Implicitly, in his past speech, he had wanted them to pray for him that he, and no one but he, should lead them into the Land. At that time, he had realized that God wished to appoint Joshua in his place. Without their prayer—alone, unaided—he would not be able to lead them to their destination. His speech at that time had performed his solitude, his helplessness, and his appeal for their prayers: “I can no longer bear you alone . . .” He had wanted them to respond to his hint—“I need your prayers now!” Moses had wished that the people would want to help him achieve his own desire.",

In effect, they confirm his isolation. In this reading, the issue between Moses and the people is his personal desire and disappointment.",
            "Why then does Moses tell the people this story at the beginning of “his own book”? On this reading, overtones of disappointment permeate his story. Perhaps he wants, in this final stage of his interaction with them, to generate in them a sense of how his life is bound up with theirs, in his prayers and in theirs. At that time, he was in their hands; perhaps he in some sense remains in their hands. He intimates his susceptibility to them, to their desires, to their prayers.

Let me, I pray, cross over and see the good Land on the other side of the Jordan” (Deut. 3:23–25). He tells the people of his passionate prayer and of God’s trenchant repudiation: “Enough! Never speak to Me of this matter again!”",
            "Effectively, God closes his mouth. God had imposed the mission of redemption—of <i>speaking</i>—on him in the first place. From the beginning, Moses had replied, “I am not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10). More than that, he had used words graphically to convey his wordlessness: “I am heavy of mouth and heavy of tongue.” And, “I am of uncircumcised lips” (6:12, 30). His subjective sense of intimate weights on mouth, tongue, lips, of burdens, blocks, was countered by God’s insistence. But now, it is God who blocks him: no more speaking to Me of this matter!",
            "This is the story that Moses tells his people. Why would he want them to know of his harshest moment of frustration— God’s curt dismissal of his words? “<i>God would not listen to me</i> . . .” His narrative is the only source of information about this intimate moment. Why does Moses choose to reveal such a painful narrative to his people, as well as to generations of future readers?",
            "In both these narratives, a confounding vulnerability is played out in front of the people. In the last months of his life, Moses expresses himself in a new and personal way to the people whom he has in the past commanded, reproached, exhorted.

His people have been struck dumb by the traumas of Egypt; they are incapable of testifying for themselves. Primo Levi’s dark statement “<i>We are not the true witnesses</i>” intimates for us the urgency of Moses’ repeated intercessions for his people. The burden of unexpressed national pain, of what kabbalistic sources call <i>galut ha-dibbur</i> (the exile of the word), makes him responsible to speak “for Israel,” the people’s strangled voices shifting the weights in his mouth.",

On this vector, it seems, the impediments that seal his mouth remain largely in place.",

Moses’ words fall on deaf ears till shortly before the end of the story.",
            "As for his people, throughout the journey in the wilderness, he all too often silently enacts his despair in the face of the people’s querulousness. He “falls on his face” four times in the book of Numbers. On these occasions, his face in the sand, he dramatically stages what it is to be at a loss for words.",
            "In the narrative of the Spies, for instance, in the crisis of a national death wish, when the people are ready to replace him and return to Egypt (Num. 14:4), Moses and Aaron leave to Caleb and Joshua the task of responding to the rebels (14:5–9). And when Moses does address the people in situations of national crisis, as in the Korach rebellion, he receives no real response. In this context, too, his words fall on deaf ears (16:5–14). Even the sarcastic response of Datan and Aviram highlights the ongoing motif of Moses’ sensed ineffectiveness: “Moses was very angry” (16:15) is read by Rashi as “He was very distressed.” This is the lifelong distress of one who knows himself unheard by his people.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf.

While his intercessions with God “on behalf of Israel” are eloquent and effective, his interactions with the people are often curt, angry, adversarial. His ease of communication with God throws into high relief the thwarted nature of his exchanges with his people. Only in the human context does he audibly stammer.",
            "But is his speech problem actually a stammer? There seem to be two main theories among the classic commentaries of the Torah text.

            "We notice that the classic commentaries tend to minimize Moses’ speech problem, regardless of whether it is organic or cultural: he is simply not as eloquent as he needs to be if he is to act as God’s spokesman; he is not good with words. By contrast, the rabbinic literature seems to understand Moses’ speech issue as more radical. We have suggested that the early conditions of Moses’ life may have created a split in identity and, thus, a confusion of tongues. If we read the text describing Moses’ birth and infancy through the prism of midrashic commentary, we come up with a “thicker” version of the origins of his language difficulty—one that supports a psychoanalytic reading.",

The princess comes down to the river and sees the basket and sends her <i>amah</i> to <i>take</i> it. What is <i>amah</i>? Most obviously, her maidservant. But also, Rashi adds, “her hand— which was miraculously lengthened by many cubits (<i>amot</i>), so that she could reach the basket.”",
            "It is at this point that we begin to notice the prevalence of hands and handling in this early life story. There is taking and placing and hiding.

Helpless, with no control over the conditions of his handling, the infant is touched and held by a world that he did not choose. Before he ever acts, he is acted upon.",
            "Before he even issues his first significant wail, he is <i>seen</i>, by his mother and by Pharaoh’s daughter, who first sees the basket in the river, then opens it and sees the child who starts wailing. It is the face-to-face impact of the crying child that arouses her compassion, and her recognition of his Hebrew origin. Her seeing, then, extends beyond the immediate scene: it makes connections; it becomes compassionate insight into the fate of Hebrew babies in general.",
            "In addition, the child’s wail strikes her as the cry of a much older child—a <i>na’ar</i>, a youth. She recognizes a precocious, symbolic power in this infant voice.

She brings the baby’s mother to suckle the baby for Pharaoh’s daughter.

            "The question of the growth and development of a human being is central to this narrative. In particular, this early life story focuses implicitly on Moses’ birth into tactile being.

Eyes and hands now characterize him as a sentient and active being. But this first use of his hand is violent— an oblique act of identification with his brothers. The next day, he again “emerges,” this time to <i>see</i> two Hebrews fighting and to speak his first words: “Why would you strike your fellow?” (2:13). Already, the enigma of violence among his own people undermines the ethical simplicity of the previous day.",
            "However, the relational matrix in which he has been reared has held its own complexity. He has been moved back and forth between the different touches of his two mothers. His new Egyptian mother, speculates the Talmud, would first have sought an Egyptian wet nurse for him; but <i>lo yanak</i>—he refused to suckle! In a most un-infantlike manner, he turns away from offered breasts.

This is what makes the newborn properly human. There is a suggestion here of the rupture, the wound of language: of a loss, a neediness of the body, of its impressionability and its quest for control and connection. Language rushes in to compensate for primal losses. But this critical moment of birth into a complex humanity, suggests Maharal, was never experienced by Moses. His relationship to language—to his mouth—is, in some radical way, different from that of other human beings.",
            "Nevertheless, even as he refuses to suckle, he has already been held in the hands of others. Even as he emerges and acts in the world, forming himself, he has already been formed by others. Before he begins to touch, to strike out at the world, he has been touched.",

He strikes the Red Sea and splits it. And, in the end, he strikes the rock at Meriva, thus stalling, as it turns out, a vital process of touching his people to holiness and faith. In God’s words, it is “because you have not trusted Me, to sanctify Me before the eyes of the Israelites” (Num. 20:12), that he will not enter the Holy Land. Instead of soft words, he has used angry blows—a failure in touch.",

The time is toward the end of the forty-year journey; the people are again bitterly complaining about “no water to drink” (20:5). God’s instructions are ambiguous: Moses is to <i>take the staff</i>—but to <i>speak</i> to the rock. This is different from the previous narrative of water-from-the-rock, thirty-eight years earlier, when he had been told, unequivocally, to <i>strike</i> the rock in order to produce water (Ex. 17:6).",
            "The shock effect of the later narrative is delayed to the end. After Moses twice strikes the rock, water issues forth vigorously and the people drink.

On the face of it, Moses has succeeded: water has issued from the rock, and the people have quenched their thirst. But God brings a strange viewpoint to the action. This is a failure, He says, in speaking before the <i>eyes</i> of the people. There was a dramatic, <i>visual</i> power to be revealed in the act of speaking to the rock; this would have deepened the people’s trust in God: “You have failed to <i>create trust</i> by sanctifying Me <i>before their eyes</i>.”",
            "What God wanted of Moses was subtly expressed in His command: not simply that water should issue forth, but that Moses should bring it forth, <i>elicit</i> it from the hard rock—<i>for them</i>; that, in tenderness and care for his people, he should touch them by touching the rock with his words, rather than by exercising the brutal power of his hand/staff.",

They would have become aware of the vulnerability of human flesh, as compared to stony rock; to the heart’s <i>impressionability</i> to the touch of God’s word. Before their eyes, a transformation would have taken place—rock to water—which would have engaged with their own fantasies of inner transformation.

            "<small>“And Moses entreated before the Lord his God” (32:11). R. Tanchuma b.

Hanina said: The good advocate knows how to present his case clearly before the tribunal. Moses was one of two advocates that arose to defend Israel and set themselves, as it were, against God. These were Moses and Daniel. That Moses was one we deduce from: “if Moses His chosen had not stood in the breach.” . . . These were the two men who set their face against the attribute of strict justice in order to plead for mercy on Israel’s behalf.</small>",

When the prince’s tutor saw that his pupil was being condemned, he pushed the prosecutor outside the court and put himself in his place in order to plead on the prince’s behalf. Similarly, when Israel made the Golden Calf, Satan stood within (before God) accusing them, while Moses was outside. What did Moses do? He arose and pushed Satan out and put himself in his place, as it says, “If His chosen one had not stood in the breach before Him”—that is, he put himself in place of him who was causing the breach.</small>",
            "<small>R. Samuel b. Nahman said: It is difficult to say that he “stood in the breach before Him.” It can be explained by the case of a king who was angry with his son and took his place on the tribunal and tried him and pronounced him guilty. As he was about to take up the pen to sign the verdict, his associate snatched the pen from his hand in order to appease his  anger. Similarly, when Israel committed that act, God sat in judgment upon them to condemn them, for it says, “Let Me alone, that I may destroy them” (Deut. 9:14). But He had not  yet done so, but was about to seal their decree, as it says, “He  that sacrifices to the gods, except to God alone, shall be utterly destroyed” (Ex. 22:19). So what did Moses do? He took the Tablets from God’s hands in order to avert His anger.</small>",
            "<small>This can be compared to a king who sent a marriage broker to betroth a wife to him, but while the broker was on his way, the woman offended with another man. What did the broker, who was entirely innocent, do? He took the marriage document that the king had given him to betroth her with and tore it up, saying: “It is better that she be judged as an unmarried woman rather than as a married woman.” This is what Moses did; when Israel committed that act, he took the Tables and shattered them, as if to imply that had Israel foreseen the punishment awaiting them, they would not have sinned. Moreover, Moses said: “Better that they be judged as unintentional sinners than as willful sinners”—because in the Decalogue it says, “I am the Lord your God,” and the punishment for breaking this commandment is: “He that sacrifices to the gods, except to God alone, shall be utterly destroyed.” Therefore he broke the Tablets.</small>",
            "<small>“And He spoke of destroying them”: Immediately, Moses girded his loins for prayer.

            "Moses acts as a good “defense counsel” for Israel, when God is about to destroy them after the sin of the Golden Calf.

Tanchuma cites another prooftext: “He spoke of destroying them, if Moses His chosen one had not stood in the breach before Him (before His <i>face</i>)” (Ps. 106:23). R. Chuna defines the good advocate as one who explains, clarifies the <i>face</i> (<i>masbir panim</i>) of his case before the tribunal.

            "Three parables follow. In the first, the prince’s tutor intervenes when the prosecuting counsel seems to be prevailing: he rudely pushes the prosecuting counsel off his dais in court and stands in his place in order to defend the prince. So, R. Berachya says, Moses pushes Satan, who is effectively attacking the Israelites, out of his place <i>inside</i> (<i>b’fnim</i>) the court. He then stands in Satan’s place.",
            "The second rabbinic parable tells of an angry king who is just about to sign the verdict condemning his son, when his “associate” (<i>sunkatedro</i>) snatches the pen out of his hand <i>to avert his anger</i>. So God is about to sign the death warrant against Israel when Moses seizes the stone tablets (the text that proscribes the sin of idolatry) in order <i>to avert His anger</i>.",
            "A third parable involves a wife instead of a son. The lady offends her husband-to-be just when the marriage broker is on his way to betroth her to the king. The broker saves the situation by tearing up the marriage document, destroying the text that would have condemned her. In this way, she can claim ignorance of the requirements of marriage. So Moses shatters the Tablets, thus giving Israel the pretext of ignorance.",
            "In the last section, the expression <i>Va-yichal</i> (“Moses entreated God”) is read: he acted unceremoniously, with scant respect (<i>chol</i> meaning profanely, brazenly) for God: “He stood in (lit.) <i>light-headedness</i> before the face of God to ask for the needs of Israel.” Here again, it is the face with which Moses faces God that lends a dramatic, even a theatrical aspect to the encounter.",
            "In this arresting midrash, the rabbis are, in effect, interpreting the nature of Moses’ face-to-face relation with God. “And God would speak face-to-face to Moses, as a man speaks to his friend” (Ex. 33:11). To speak face-to-face is clearly different from <i>seeing God’s face</i>, which, as we discover a few verses later, is the further intimacy that Moses requests and is denied (33:20). To speak face-to-face is to adopt a face, one of many possible facets of a relationship. In order to advocate for Israel, Moses unceremoniously puts on a hostile face, in order to stand <i>against</i> God’s face of strict justice.",
            "As the parables proceed, Moses’ role-playing becomes more violent. At first, he opposes God, “as it were.” Then, without apology, he opposes God’s justice. Then, he pushes the prosecution counsel out of court and takes his place. Then, he seizes the pen from the king’s hand. Finally, he tears up the betrothal document.",
            "What gives Moses license to behave in such a vigilante manner? Particularly surprising is the dramatic detail of replacing the prosecutor inside the court: in effect, Moses is changing places with Satan, from an external to an intimate position (before the king’s face). By a kind of sleight of hand, he substitutes himself for Satan and defends the people from a “satanic” (aggressive, oppositional) place.",
            "Strikingly, the midrash calls Moses “the king’s <i>associate</i>.” Moses knows that he has an ally in God. Beneath the judicial formalities, there is an affinity that connects God and Moses. Both are interested in the vindication and survival of Israel (the king’s son). Moses knows, even as he puts his most aggressive face forward, that he is serving the divine desire in defending Israel. This collusiveness with God allows Moses to play roles, as in a human encounter, where one reads the ambivalence of the other, intuitively eliciting his most loving self. The dynamics of an intimate relationship are called into play.",
            "This audacious dynamic lies at the heart of many rabbinic interpretations of the biblical text. Moses acts as His Majesty’s Loyal Opposition, as Yochanan Muffs aptly terms it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yohanan Muffs, “His Majesty’s Loyal Opposition: A Study in Prophetic Intercession,” <i>Conservative Judaism</i> 33:3 (1978–1980): 25–37.</i> He has, in a sense, internalized the function of prosecutor, the angry, antagonistic role; he uses his anger in order to “avert God’s anger.”",
            "His lifelong anger, in this case, finds a way of acting in the interest of compassion. In another striking Talmudic passage, Moses ascends to the higher worlds, only to have God reprimand him: “Moses, don’t they say Shalom [Good morning!] where you come from?” Moses answers, “Master of the Universe, does a servant say Shalom to his master?” God then says, “You should have helped Me!” (Rashi comments: “You should have said, May You succeed in Your work!”) Immediately, Moses responds, “Now, may the divine power grow greater!”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">B.

Brachot 7a).</i>",
            "Moses’ intimacy with God transforms his modesty into an enactment of his power to “help” God. He is God’s servant, but, like one who speaks with his friend, he intuits what kind of conversation God desires. He mobilizes his deepest resources, sometimes of anger, against the divine forces of destruction.",
            "Divine anger plays a large role in the biblical imagination. What can a human being do in the face of this anger, if not use his own knowledge of anger to move God from one place to another? The image of the father’s anger with his son is a midrashic commonplace; fathers notoriously tend to become enraged. What is needed is an intercessor, who cares for both father and son, who will know how to soothe the paternal fury.",
            "Moses knows about anger; it is not hard for him to enter into the role of Satan, the Accuser. In this role, he becomes aggressively masculine: pushing, snatching, tearing, girding his loins. Here, it seems, is “Moses, the man” in full force, taking charge of the relationship. And yet this masculine persona is only one aspect of the situation. It is equally true that his role is played in order to “ask for the needs of Israel,” as the midrash points out. Moses, however assertive, is nevertheless in the position that is attributed to the <i>wife</i> who asks/demands the household expenses from her husband. In pleading for the existential needs of his people, Moses is playing a distinctly feminine role.",
            "In other words, his relation with God embraces both the power and the powerlessness of his intimacy with the divine. In transcending the formal postures of “feminine” behavior, he plays roles that are expressive of the full range of a relationship face-to-face with God. He is, in fact, playing out the implications of his own question, “Who am I?” In context, the question has a limited reference: “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?” But, in addition to this obvious self-deprecating meaning, “Who am I?” stands alone as a starkly existential question. This is, for Moses, <i>the</i> question: “Who is the <i>I</i> who is being called?”",
            "<b><small>“MOST BEAUTIFUL OF WOMEN”</small></b><br>Face-to-face with God, Moses is both masculine and feminine. In rabbinic parable, his assertiveness, his unceremonious behavior, his girding his loins in prayer—these constitute precisely the persona of the wife making demands of her husband, for and on behalf of her household. In the midrashic imagination, Moses becomes “most beautiful among women” (Song of Songs 1:8):",
            "<small>Most beautiful of prophets, most excellent of prophets! [I.e., Moses] Why are the prophets compared to women?

            "The “feminine” character of prophets is expressed by their bold demands of God who, like the man of the house, is personally implicated in the welfare of his family. Moses’ “wifely” understanding of God’s intimate concern for his people allows him a bold range of behaviors. In the end, the differences between typically masculine and feminine, aggressive and submissive behaviors blur in the light of a larger vision: these are, after all, roles played in the interest of a common passion.",
            "So Moses stages his anger in order to avert God’s anger. His concern for Israel is ultimately at one with his connection with God. Most excellent of prophets, Moses becomes in the rabbinic imagination the paradigm of the human being who is emboldened in his very humanity. The feminine figure of Ruth—the solitary stranger who makes her demands of the rich landowner—comes to mind. At the end of the night on the granary floor, she “girds her loins like a male,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ruth Rabba 7:2.</i> with six ears of corn in her kerchief, and returns to Naomi (Ruth 3:15). In calling her a “woman of valor” (3:11), Boaz recognizes her as transcending the stereotypes of male and female, like the “woman of valor” in Proverbs 31:17: “She girds her loins in strength.”",
            "Simple gender distinctions are blurred in Moses’ self-presentation. Many rabbinic narratives play out the implications of his “wife-prophet” identity. But we remember the question that Moses asked at the Burning Bush: “Who am I?” immediately following on “Here I am!” In Moses’ speculations about his relation to the people, the question persists. His body becomes the subject of outrageous fantasies: pregnant, birthing, suckling and bearing his people, a feminine persona emerges from the shadows, appalling and yet strangely necessary to imagining an unimaginable role. A new <i>I</i> is in the process of being born; and as in all births, the nascent self encounters resistance.",
            "<b><small>FEMINIZATIONS</small></b><br>Only in his interventions with God in defense of the people does Moses enact his role with unabashed force. In his connection with God, he knows that this masculine/feminine persona is the effect of his total concern for the <i>bayit</i>—the household of Israel—which is, ultimately, both his and God’s. Face to face with God, he is free to express an adversary loyalty to God’s true desire.",
            "For it is a <i>bayit</i> that, ultimately, God and Moses are building.

            "Gentleness (“douceur”) as the primordial ground of meeting with the Other is implicit in the “feminine” face of the prophets, and especially of Moses. His intimacy with God can only be represented by the intimacy of marriage, or of two friends who speak to one another. These intimacies contain an infinity and invoke a radiant separateness.",
            "It is, therefore, largely in his encounters with the Other who is God that Moses comes to know and feel his own humanity. The concern of these encounters is, most potently, the people who are the “household” of mutual concern. However, when Moses encounters the people themselves, the story becomes much more complicated. Here, the Rabbis intuit that he sometimes feels “as weak as a female.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Rashi to Num. 11:15; B. Brachot 32a on Num. 14:16; Rashi on Deut. 5:24. Sometimes, Moses feels “as weak as a woman” in the face of the people’s intransigence; other times, he protests at God’s presumed helplessness in the eyes of the nations.</i> Here, he struggles with a “feminization” of his being that is experienced as a helplessness: the people are doomed beyond any possibility of salvation.",
            "At such moments, he is thrown back to an infant dependency on the touch of others. How can he be the powerful mother if his primal being is that of the infant, speechless and susceptible? “Weak as a woman” is indeed the weakest and least imaginative of the associations of femininity. The female shares with the infant a moment where agency totally fails.",
            "<b><small>HIS OWN BOOK</small></b><br>It is against this background that Moses’ final speeches in Deuteronomy stand out in high relief. In these autobiographical speeches, a complex <i>I</i> for the first time appears in the biblical text. As he recounts the events of the last forty years, he constructs, from his present perspective, the narratives of the past. <i>Shema yisrael</i>, “Hear o Israel,” he says, in his own voice, exhorting the people <i>now</i> and <i>here</i> to internalize and teach others what was undergone many years ago: laws were given and dramas played out <i>in those days</i> and <i>in that time</i>, in which <i>I</i> played a key role.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Often, his present account differs significantly from the “real time” account, particularly in the words that he remembers speaking. The reshapings of memory are everywhere in these last speeches. His earlier references to himself and his speech problems were largely couched in the negative, delineating an absence —“heavy of mouth,” “not a man of words”—or a <i>too-muchness</i>—of uncircumcised lips—and implying unspeakable experience.</i> In saying <i>I</i>, over and over, Moses gives an account of himself that effectively creates his past self. As a feeling, knowing person, he is giving birth to himself in this new <i>I</i>; he is answering his own original question, “Who am I?”",
            "When the Talmud declares that Moses “wrote his own book,” therefore, it suggests that he wrote this book of Deuteronomy with a singularly intimate intent. It is “his own book” because in it his <i>I</i> is animated to feel and know as never before. In this, as in so much else, he plays out the implicit tensions of his people’s narrative. For the first time, he cites himself with a sense of his implication in their dilemmas.",
            "<b><small>AMAZING INSENTIENCE</small></b><br>One particularly poignant moment of this kind comes toward the end when he reproaches the people, “God has not given you a heart to know, or eyes to see, or ears to hear, until this day” (Deut. 29:3).",
            "For forty years, he has led the people through the wilderness. But it is only now that he can articulate their tragic flaw: their lack of <i>sentience</i>. Only now, retrospectively, can Moses speak, not only of obedience and disobedience, faith and skepticism, but also of the heart, the eyes, and the ears that are unaccountably absent from their body experience. Their senses, their ability to be affected by the world, are somehow deficient.",
            "This is his last speech before they enter the Covenant, which ends the Torah narrative. He has just spoken of all the great signs and wonders that their eyes have seen, even repeating the expression, “that your eyes have seen” (29:2). Why, then, does he add this personal, scathing coda about their amazing insentience over the forty years of his leadership? Perhaps, suggests the Talmud, he is referring to a developmental capacity— for gratitude—that only “this day” has finally evolved: “From here we learn,” says Rava, “that one does not fully understand one’s teacher until forty years have passed.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">B. Avoda Zara 5b.</i>",
            "Rava reads hopefully, against the grain of the text. It is the emotional and moral resonances of one’s teacher’s Torah that may take forty years to realize. Rashi adds: “Till this very day” suggests that “this day you have become a people!” (29:6). Now, they are responsible for their own moral being.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Rashi to 29:6.</i> Moses has granted the people forty years of latitude; now begins their time of full moral responsibility. Their past deficits are part of their process of maturation.",
            "However, in another comment, Rashi goes further: “<i>God has not given you a heart to know</i>: to recognize God’s loving acts and to cling to Him. <i>Till this very day</i>: this day I understand that you do cling to God and desire Him!” Here, the subject is not so much the people’s moral development as their passionate vision of God’s love and their emotional capacity to love Him in return. Moses criticizes the people for their insentience, and, implicitly, celebrates the radical turn in their relation to God, “this very day.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Till this day”: The question is whether “till” includes “this day” or not. Rashi reads optimistically, citing a midrashic story to indicate that the people have changed.</i> Gratitude and love are now within their range of religious experience.",
            "If the people have indeed changed, then the change can be put down to the fact that this is, in fact, a new generation. When Moses speaks of their past, then, he is often referring to the experience of their parents’ generation. <i>You</i> is a more slippery reference than it seems. But so, it turns out, is <i>I</i>.",
            "“Now, I understand that you do desire God!” Perhaps this new generation is only beginning to desire; perhaps those who cannot see and hear and feel have never been rightly touched. The experience of <i>tactility</i> is the ground on which the <i>I</i> begins to see, hear, and feel—and to become utterable. Their life as a full <i>I</i> begins only at the end of the forty-year wilderness time. Something finally touches them into being, capable ultimately of <i>knowing from the heart</i>.",
            "But if there is a deficit in the people’s nurturing, Moses is implicated in this failure. He was to have been the nurturing mother who bore them in his bosom (Num. 11:12); that primary <i>holding</i> relation of mother and infant never quite happened. Moses’ personal history not only affects his relation with his people but also dramatically plays out the implicit tensions of their national history.",
            "Handed back and forth between two mothers, drawn out of the deathly river to become a son to the Egyptian princess, while his true mother is forced to abandon him, Moses in his infancy is held in close focus. This is the ground of his life: fraught with loss, formed by the will of the powerful and the helplessness of the weak, held and relinquished and held and relinquished, until he <i>emerges</i> to find his brothers in their humiliation.",
            "If he finds it inconceivable to <i>hold</i> this people in the way that he imagines God wants him to do, that is a direct effect of his own earliest history. “Who am I?” becomes a burning question. And when at the end of his life he recognizes a radical deficit in his people, perhaps at the same time he recognizes the ways in which he has not fully held them (“<i>This day I understand</i> that you passionately desire God!”). If they have not developed a certain emotional <i>knowing</i>, perhaps this is both a reflection of his own history and a partial effect of it?",
            "But when Moses last addresses the people before the Covenant, he seems to imply that now, “on this day,” they have finally developed a knowing heart, seeing eyes, and hearing ears—and that he has developed a new understanding of them. Perhaps this moment also marks a development in himself as leader and nurturer?",
            "How has this development taken place? Why is it that Moses’ language in Deuteronomy is now full of references to love between the people and God: expressions like <i>chashak, chafatz, ahav</i>—desire, wish, love—appear in these last speeches as never before. A new note enters Moses’ language. His retellings of their history are animated by a new use of the autobiographic <i>I</i>.",
            "<b><small>INTIMATE NARRATIVES</small></b><br>We can now return to the scene in which Moses tells the people of his frustrated prayer: “Please let me cross over . . .” (Deut. 3:25). We asked why Moses chooses to convey this scene to the people. This painful interchange—“Enough! Never speak to Me of this matter again!”—is never narrated in any other way. What would have been lost if Moses (or the narrator) had quietly suppressed the story? What is gained by communicating this private moment of humiliation?",
            "He not only tells it to the people but then also writes it, at God’s behest, into “his own book.” We, generations of readers, know not only what happened between Moses and God but also that Moses chose to communicate this to his listeners and readers, for all time. The final choice is, of course, the narrator’s decision to narrate this intimate episode in this way.",
            "Moses’ narrative is, I suggest, also a narrative of Moses’ initiation into a newly evocative confrontation with his people. Between the lines, he tells another story in which both he and they are implicated in complex and intimate ways. If God told him so curtly, “Never speak to Me of this matter again!” implicitly He was also saying, “Never speak <i>to Me</i> . . .”—redirecting Moses’ words away from God and toward the people.",
            "We have seen how often Moses has been eloquent and effective in his interventions with God. Now—because the issue concerns his personal desire—God blocks his access to the divine and reframes the situation as a human one. The main issue is not God’s decree but the fraught relations between Moses and his people.",
            "In dramatic reconstructions of Moses’ speeches, midrashic sources attend to this counternarrative. In these texts, Moses narrates his disappointment, not only with God’s response, but also with the people’s apathy. The focus of these speeches is personal: Moses strikes an unprecedented note of candor when he reproaches his people for abandoning him in his hour of need.",
            "It is this emotional timbre that animates his many references, for instance, to the theme of “You are crossing over; I am not crossing over”: “You shall not cross over; Joshua will cross over” (Deut. 3:27–28); or, “I die in this land, I am not crossing over the Jordan, but you are crossing over” (4:22). What sounds out of these many juxtapositions of his fate and theirs is, according to one midrashic tradition, disappointment, reproach, sadness, anger. Similarly, the final reproach that we have just discussed—“God has not given you a heart to know, eyes to see, ears to hear, till this day . . .”—is read as overwhelmingly <i>personal</i>.",
            "Here is one such midrash:",
            "<small>Therefore, when they came to cross over the Jordan, Moses reminded them of every plea that he had made on their behalf, because he thought that they would pray on his behalf that he should enter the Land with them. What is the force of “You will pass over”? R. Tanchuma said: Moses prostrated himself before Israel and said to them: “You are to pass over, but not I,” and he gave them the opportunity [opened an opening for them] to pray for him, but they did not understand him.</small>",
            "<small>This can be compared to a king who had many children by a noble lady. The lady offended him and he resolved to divorce her. He said to her: “Know that I am going to marry another wife.” She replied: “Yes, but won’t you tell me whom it is you intend to marry?” He replied: “So-and-so.” What did the noble lady do? She summoned her children and said to them: “Know that your father intends to divorce me and to marry So-and-so; could you bear being subjected to her?” They replied: “Yes!” She then said: “Know what she will do to you.” She thought that perhaps they would understand what she meant and would intercede with their father on her behalf, but they did not understand. As they did not understand, she said: “I will command you only for your own sake—Be mindful of your father’s honor!”</small>",
            "<small>So it was with Moses. When God said to him: “Take Joshua the son of Nun . . .” (Num. 27:18); “For you shall not pass over this Jordan” (Deut. 3:27), Moses said to Israel, “And it shall come to pass, when the Lord your God shall bring you into the Land where you are going to possess it” (Deut. 11:29); when he stressed the words, “<i>You</i> are to pass over this day [not I],” he thought that perhaps Israel would understand. As they did not understand, he said: “I will command you only for your own sakes; be mindful of the honor of your Father in heaven.” How do we know this? For it is said, “That you may fear the Lord your God . . .” (Deut. 6:2).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy Rabba 3:12.</i></small>",
            "Here, Moses solicits his people, hinting to them that they might plead for God’s mercy on him. He cannot directly ask for their prayers that he be allowed to lead them into the Land; all he can do is “open an opening” for their own spontaneous understanding. He prostrates himself before them, acting out his need for their intercession, reminding them of his history of intercession in their hour of need. But they do not “understand”—<i>lo hayu mevinim</i>: intuition is sorely lacking at this point. Here we have the midrashic background for the Hassidic commentary of Mei HaShiloach that we discussed earlier in this chapter.",
            "In the rather sardonic parable of the noble lady who pleads with her children to intervene with their father, the mother asks leading questions to sensitize them to her danger. But with amazing obtuseness, they “do not understand”; they fail to “get it.” In the end, she warns them that life with their father and without her interventions will be difficult for them too. But they still fail to take the hint.",
            "Why can the noble lady not ask her children directly to intercede with their father for her? Why can Moses not appeal explicitly for his people’s help? This is the delicate nature of the relationship of the leader with his people: the question of love and desire, as in the mother/child relation, hangs between them. “Do you really want me? If you do, you will press my case; you will help me cross over the Jordan.” A fraught relation like that of Moses and the Israelites is being tested; the people are insensitive to Moses’ desire for their desire; they manifest an emotional immaturity that can only pain Moses.",
            "The fact that the midrash puts him into the specific situation of a <i>mother</i> who is subject to the desires of both her husband and her children serves, yet again, to play out the “feminine” voice of Moses’ identity. Moses’ helpless condition—“weak as a woman”—emerges in words of satirical power. This paradox, of constitutive helplessness and literary power, gives bitter personal meaning, as we have suggested, to his final criticism of the people: “God has not given you a heart to know . . .”:",
            "<small>Another explanation: “<i>God has not given you a heart to know</i>”: R. Samuel b. Nahmani said: Moses said this with reference to his own situation. How so? God made two decrees, one affecting Israel, and one affecting Moses. The first was when they committed the unmentionable sin [the Golden Calf]. For it is said, “Let Me alone, that I may destroy them” (Deut. 9:14). The other decree was when Moses sought to enter the Land of Israel and God said to him, “You shall not pass over this Jordan” (Deut. 3:27). Moses therefore entreated God to annul both decrees. He said: “Master of the Universe, Pardon, I pray you, the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of Your lovingkindness” (Num. 14:19) and God’s decree was annulled, while Moses’ prayer was fulfilled. How do we know this? For it is said, “I have pardoned according to your word” (14:20).</small>",
            "<small>When he was about to enter the Land, Moses entreated: “Let me cross over, I pray You, and see the good Land” (Deut. 3:25). God replied: “Moses, on a former occasion, you annulled My decree and I granted your prayer; I said: ‘Let Me destroy them,’ and you prayed, ‘Pardon, I pray You,’ and your prayer was fulfilled. On this occasion, I desire to carry out My decree and to refuse your prayer.” God added: “Moses, you do not know how to behave! You wish to hold the rope by both ends! If you insist on My granting ‘Let me cross over, I pray You,’ then you must withdraw the prayer, ‘Pardon, I pray You’; and if you insist on ‘Pardon, I pray You,’ then you must withdraw, ‘Let me pass over, I pray You.’”</small>",
            "<small>R. Joshua b. Levi said: When Moses our teacher heard this, he exclaimed before God: “Master of the Universe, let Moses and a hundred like perish rather than that the fingernail of even one of them be injured!” R. Samuel b. Isaac said: When Moses was nearing his end and Israel did not pray for him that he should enter the Land, he assembled them and began rebuking them with the words: One man saved sixty myriads at the time of the Golden Calf, and yet sixty myriads cannot save one man! This is the force of, “<i>God has not given you a heart to know</i>.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy Rabba 7:11.</i></small>",
            "The people’s insentience begins and ends the passage. This is the proof-text for the theme of Moses’ reproach, here called a <i>tochacha</i>, a rebuke. But in this rebuke, Moses is personally implicated. He speaks not for general principles of proper behavior but out of his own intimate narrative of betrayal by his people.",
            "He tells a story of his own surrender of his dearest desire in favor of the people’s need. Of his two prayers—“Please forgive Your people’s sin” and “Please let me cross over . . .”—Moses must choose only one. Unhesitatingly, he chooses to annul the divine decree against his people, relinquishing his own desire.",
            "His choice is, in a sense, a foregone conclusion. When God tells him that he cannot overrule the divine decree on both issues, his response is hyperbolic: “Let Moses and a hundred like him die, rather than one fingernail of even one of them be injured!” A fingernail against a hundred Moseses! This is the narrative he presents to the people, to express his disappointment at their insensitivity: “God did not give you a heart to know. . .” The biblical words become vehicles for a painful and personal reproach; they carry a story of sacrificial love to which the people have failed to respond.",
            "But this story, which brings to light Moses’ present understanding of himself—“Who am I?”—is composed in the moment of “rebuke.” The rebuke reveals more than perhaps he knows—not only a critique of the people, but a wounded sense of himself. Before Moses voices the critique—in this midrashic version—it is only implicit within the words of the Torah. Now, Moses’ speeches reveal, from between the lines of the Torah, a history of unrequited love and grievance. The people have been heartless, blind, and deaf to the implicit meanings of the story. If they had had a heart to know, they might have put this story together for themselves; they might have understood the ethical demand it made on them to pray for Moses.",
            "This kind of address, as “rebuke,” involves the speaker in bringing his own life into full, vulnerable presence. <i>Tochacha</i> (rebuke) is related to <i>nocheach</i>—being present. In the first person, Moses is present before the people: surrendering his own interests for theirs, ironically comparing the ratios of 1 for 600,000 and 600,000 for 1. If he is to reach them in the singular mode of <i>tochacha</i>, he must bring the concentrated force of his own history, of his emotional presence, to bear on them.",
            "<b><small>FOR THE SAKE OF ISRAEL</small></b><br>At this late turning point, Moses, who has always complained to God about the people’s deafness—“They will not believe me, nor will they listen to my voice!” (Ex. 4:1)—now complains to the people about God’s refusal to listen to him. In the arena where language had failed him—in his connection with his people—he now allows himself to speak with irresistible eloquence and emotional candor.",
            "A passage in Midrash Tanchuma remarks dryly: “Just yesterday, you said, I am not a man of words—and now you have so much to say!”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tanchuma Devarim, 1.</i> Like springs in the desert, language gushes forth—“These are the words that Moses spoke”—in this last book of the Torah, which is “his own book.” But it is not only a matter of the <i>many</i> words of these last speeches but of the intimacy and vulnerability of his voice as he tells these stories. In the aftermath of a kind of rupture with God—who, for the first time, refuses to listen to him—Moses turns toward a new conversation with his people. Now, he must use his own imagination, his “understanding,” to hear what is not explicitly said. God has closed one door and, implicitly, provokes him to open another door.",
            "This is not, in fact, the first time that God has cut off the conversation between Himself and Moses. According to a midrashic tradition, the thirty-eight years during which the entire generation dies in the wilderness are years in which God does not speak to Moses. In Rashi’s words:",
            "<small>“And God spoke to me” (Deut. 2:17): But from the time of the Spies till now, there is no mention of God’s speaking (<i>vayidaber</i>), only of saying (<i>va-yomer</i>). This teaches that all 38 years when the people were in disfavor, God did not <i>speak</i>— affectionately, face to face, and deliberately—with Moses. This teaches that the divine Presence does not come to rest on the prophet except <i>for the sake of Israel</i>.</small>",
            "God’s relationship with Moses, unique and intimate as it may be, is only “for the sake of Israel.” When the people live in the shadow of death, Moses has no access to the divine. Only after the dying is over (2:16), does God, in the full sense, again <i>speak</i> to Moses.",
            "This, too, is part of the message that Moses communicates to the people in his last speeches. God’s loving communion is calibrated according to the rhythms of the people’s life and death. When God explicitly stops Moses in mid-sentence, it is as though He were redirecting him to another horizon of desire.",
            "<b><small>SUBLIMATED DESIRE</small></b><br>Strangely, it is precisely after God has finally dashed his hopes of “crossing over” that Moses achieves a new force of language. Rashi situates his aborted prayer at the juncture, in Numbers 27:12, where God, rather mysteriously, commands Moses to “ascend the Mount of Transitions and look at the land.” No prayer is mentioned here, but Rashi senses that God’s command is, in fact, His response to Moses’ prayer. This definitive command, “Look at it [the Land] and be gathered in to your people . . .” (27:13), is, in effect, a sentence of death.",
            "But immediately following on this, we read, “Moses <i>spoke</i> (<i>va-yidaber</i>) to God” (27:15). The force and intimacy of <i>va-­ yidaber</i> is nowhere else used in Moses’ addresses to God; the invariable form is <i>va-yomer</i>, a softer, more modest expression. Why does God’s rejection of his prayer release in him such unprecedented verbal energy? Rashi comments: “To teach the praise of the righteous, who when they depart from this world, relinquish their own needs and involve themselves in the needs of the community.” The midrash puts it succinctly: “Anyone who speaks for the community, it is as though he comes with force [lit., with the power of his arm].”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Bamidbar Rabba 21:15.</i>",
            "At this point, Moses speaks forcefully to God about the appointment of a successor. Silenced on one subject, he speaks aggressively on another. The vector of his desire has shifted. He speaks now to the people and on their behalf with a passion into which his own desire has metaphorically “crossed over.”",
            "This too is part of the story that he tells the people. There was, he says, a prayer for himself, which God cut short and he relinquished. That prayer might never have been known, if he had not told his people—who are now the object of his desire— of its thwarting. Where, he implicitly asks, were your prayers for me, or your desire for me, when my prayers were failing?",

            "Here is the paradox: the poem is essentially dialogue, but it is lonely, not greatly hopeful, yet still hopeful of a hearing. “Hear o Israel . . . !” As poet-storyteller, Moses yields his authority and unappeasably seeks out “heartland” for his poem: “I on the way to myself.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ibid.</i> He invites his people to a new kind of listening, and seeing, and knowing.",

            "In the ethical moment of encounter with the Other, Moses responded out of the anguish of his fragmented identity that, <i>nevertheless</i>, trusts that he is indeed a character in a narrative. His complex response is the “chord” effect of <i>Hineni</i> and <i>Mi anochi?</i>—“It’s me here!” and “Who am I?”",
            "It is this trust that, in his last months, he transfers; he <i>goes across</i> from his relation with God to his relation with the people. At the end of a life of conveying God’s words to them and of speaking on their behalf to God, he now addresses them as a storyteller, as a poet.",
            "He presents himself to them—<i>Hineni</i>—without omniscience or omnipotence, but with the trust that he is indeed a character in the narrative. Perhaps this is why the Torah calls him “the most humble man (<i>anav</i>) on the face of the earth” (Num. 12:3).

            "Perhaps Moses’ resistance to assuming this burden of the world is a defense against the people’s pain, which is also his. To <i>bear</i> them like an unborn or just-born child would be to expose himself to their utter helplessness, which is also his. He is solicited by their pain, which is also his. Their appeals and demands drain away his strength “like a woman,” as the midrash puts it on several occasions.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See, e.g., Rashi to Num. 11:15.</i>",
            "But in the end, he acknowledges that he is implicated in their inertia, even in their dullness. A certain gentleness (“douceur”) forms in him because of this people, as he turns himself to his maternal role. Bearing their weight becomes in his imagination living out this maternal relation with the inconceivable “gentleness” (<i>douceur</i>) of which Levinas speaks. At first, the confusion of masculine and feminine roles seems to Moses grotesque; but in the end, when he tells the people of his rejected prayer, complex unconscious resonances, amplified in the midrash, become audible in his voice.",
            "At first, on the heights of Sinai, God had to tell him, <i>Lech red</i>—“Go on down” (Ex. 19:24; 32:7) to the people; God had to eject him repeatedly, “for the sake of Israel,” from his encounter with the divine. In the end, God harshly rejects his prayer and sends him down, with the force of his whole desire-life, to a new encounter with his people. The ongoing tension between intimacy with God and intimacy with his people modulates to a new key in these last speeches.",
            "<b><small>“I AM BORN”</small></b><br>If Deuteronomy is Moses’ autobiographical moment, then it clearly has many lacunae. Among the many things that Moses does not tell his people are the stories of his birth and of his death. He gives no account of his nursing experience, of his helpless and handled condition as he was passed between mothers and worlds. To have included an account of his birth in his autobiography would have put him in the false position of the adult who recounts what he has heard from others, with the authority of his own adult <i>I</i>.",
            "A famous example of this kind of birth autobiography is the opening chapter of <i>David Copperfield</i>. The narrator describes the details of his life preceding and including his own birth. Increasingly, he inserts himself as the knowing narrator, ignoring the fact that all these early stories come to him from others. A certain “denial of infancy”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Judith Butler, <i>Senses of the Subject</i> (New York: Fordham University Press, 2015), 3.</i> seeps into his ever more authoritative account of his infant history. This opening chapter is titled “I Am Born.” To tell the story of his infant <i>I</i>, his speechless, unformed self, by mobilizing all the resources of his adult self is his impossible, yet necessary, narrative task.",
            "In Moses’ autobiographical account of himself to his people, he does not speak of his early life before the wilderness. He has no chapter titled “I Am Born.” But his final speeches do, in a sense, present him as being as speechless and helpless as an infant. He has reached the end of his effective life. Little remains within his power at this stage. But this gives him a different kind of power.",
            "He could not answer God, so he now turns to the people with his many words. The unspoken weight of their shared history haunts his story of God’s rejection. Implicitly, he reproaches them for failing to give him a hearing; and thus gains, perhaps, a hearing at last. He is both active and acted on: embodied, prostrating himself before them, susceptible, ironical, and powerful all at once.",
            "<b><small>WRITING IN TEARS</small></b><br>As for his death, he refers to it only in the context of a melancholy comment on the people’s rebelliousness (Deut. 31:27). He has, it seems, the darkest expectations of their future “after my death.” The meaning of his death, then, is limited, in his account, to its presumed effect on their future history. But, for obvious reasons, he cannot include the experience of his own death in his final narrative.",
            "However, the narrative of “his own book,” as it is finally written “by the hand of Moses,” does narrate his death. Before he dies, he writes “his own book”—which includes an account of his dying. The impossible but necessary project of writing his own death—the last eight verses, particularly—becomes the subject of evocative rabbinic discussion.",
            "On the one hand, how can he record his own death? Who, then, wrote the words “Moses died there” (Deut. 34:5)? R. Yehuda declares, “Up to that point, Moses wrote the text; from that point, Joshua wrote the last eight verses of the Torah.” On the other hand, as R. Shimeon protests, “Can we imagine the scroll of the Torah being short of one word? . . . No, we must say that up to that point, God dictated and Moses repeated the words and wrote; and from that point, God dictated and Moses wrote <i>in tears</i>.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">B. Baba Batra 14b–15a. See also B. Menachot 30a.</i>",
            "The paradox is striking: the idea that the last eight verses were written by Joshua provides a rational solution, but compromises the integrity of Moses’ prophecy (the Five Books of Moses). R. Shimeon’s view is that Moses writes of his own death—but without repeating the words and with tears in his eyes.",
            "Moses’ way of writing the last eight verses, according to R. Shimeon, is different from the writing process of the rest of the Torah. The image of Moses, writing in tears, conveys the impression of a Moses who acknowledges his own susceptibility, his sadness, and the complexity of his embodied condition. Even as he writes in the apparent self-sufficiency of the past tense and the third person—“<i>Moses died there</i> . . .”—his lips cannot frame the words; his body sheds tears.",
            "These last words are, and are not, his. The apparent sovereignty of his narrative is accompanied by the emotion of its protagonist. The perspective is almost that of the subject who is writing of himself as though he were another. Like the death of another, his death affects him. Like the people who weep for him, he mourns for himself.",
            "“Death—as the death of the other— . . . is emotion <i>par excellence</i>, affection or being affected <i>par excellence</i>.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Emmanuel Levinas, <i>God, Death, and Time</i>, trans. Bettina Bergo (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2000), 9.</i> In every death, Levinas writes, is shown the nearness of the neighbor, and the responsibility of the survivor. The apparent self-­ possession expressed in “he wrote in tears” breaks down into a complex image of Moses as his own dying neighbor.",
            "A startling reading of this Talmudic description appears in several commentaries: Moses wrote the last words <i>with tears</i>— in place of ink.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See commentaries of <i>Ritva, Maharsha</i>, and <i>Iyyun Yaacov</i> to B. Baba Batra 15a.</i> He writes of his own death in invisible ink, which becomes legible only after his death. Suddenly, we see Moses as both writing and not writing his death. He acts, and simultaneously he is affected by his human finitude. He completes his own book, but his mastery is tempered by his sense of <i>lacrimae rerum</i>, “the tears of things.” His tears are the very medium of the record, which becomes legible only after he is gone.",
            "This too is part of his last communication to his people. He plays neither the masterful hero nor the victim drowned in a sea of self-regard and self-pity. His end responds to his beginning, his death to his birth. Both are—impossibly—narrated by him, in his written text of the Five Books of Moses.",
            "We remember how his birth narrative gave us an account of what Pharaoh’s daughter saw as she opened the basket: “And she saw him, the child (<i>ha-yeled</i>). And behold, the youth (<i>na’ar</i>) was crying” (Ex. 2:6). Unlike his birth mother who is moved to hide him for three months when she “saw that he was <i>good</i>,” (2:2)—beautiful? radiant with divine light?—the princess is moved by the sight of the <i>crying</i> baby. There is something precocious, almost uncanny, about the voice of this infant; his cry has a power beyond his years. But, objects R. Nehemia, if you say that, you make him a <i>ba’al moom</i>—the bearer of an abnormality.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">B. Sotah 12.</i>",
            "What the princess sees is not the conventional image of a crying baby. This child is dense with contradictions, beautiful and blemished, helpless and powerful. She instantly recognizes the symbolic tragedy in his anguished wail. She takes pity on him as a human, endangered life—representative of the pain of his people.",
            "At the beginning and the end of his life, Moses is speechless, weeping. He takes divine dictation, without uttering the words, as he once wailed wordlessly under the princess’s gaze. His tears affect others; after his death, they are reconstituted into the wholeness of the Torah. Almost literally, he <i>puts himself</i> into his writing. Are these tears weakness? Or are they the final gift he leaves to and for his people? How else will they “understand” that they have not yet understood?",

The dying vision of it can only be intended to illustrate how incomplete a moment is human life, incomplete because a life like this could last forever and still be nothing but a moment. Moses fails to enter Canaan not because his life is too short but because it is a human life.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Franz Kafka, <i>Diaries</i> 1914–23, trans. Martin Greenberg and Hannah Arendt (New York: Schocken Books, 1965), 195–96.</i></small>",
            "The humanity of Moses’ life is for Kafka a matter of its incompleteness. “Nothing but a moment,” his life illustrates the interrupted nature of human desire. We have suggested that Moses’ desire shifts to fill other contours. In his last months, Moses reaches out in displaced desire to his people. As never before, he is implicated with them and their vital requirements. Between the wailing infant and the dying teacher, a human life arches.",
            "Personal and transpersonal, his voice becomes in later mystical thought the quintessential voice of Israel, of its scholars, of the Messiah himself. He becomes the soul-root of Israel, the very type of its creative students. When someone had a brilliant insight in the House of Study, he would be congratulated: <i>Moses, you have spoken well!</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">B. Shabbat 101b. Cf. Likkutei Moharan 4:5: “Every scholar is associated with Moses . . .”</i>",
            "In the words and wordlessness of his life, Moses is haunted not only by the past—the history of the patriarchs, of the Egyptian holocaust—but, in a real sense, by the future. The future sends out radiations during his infancy and early years. At the Burning Bush, revelation and mystery claim him: God names Himself, “<i>I shall be Who I shall be</i>.” A fire that is never consumed draws him aside toward a future self, a historical role that he passionately resists. “Who am I?” For seven days, according to the midrash, he resists God’s call, provoking, in the end, His anger.",
            "Thus a life is set in motion in which, through vision and conflict, Moses plays out the demands of his destiny. His humanity is revealed to him in the wilderness: a personal life that finds expression in the speeches of his final months. The man of God who had always spoken <i>for</i> Israel now speaks for his personal self in a way that stirs depths in those who hear him. When he reaches out to his people in the fraught language of relationship, he makes himself unforgettable. Veiled and unveiled, he remains lodged in the Jewish imagination, where, in his uncompleted humanity, he comes to represent the yet-­ unattained but attainable messianic future."
