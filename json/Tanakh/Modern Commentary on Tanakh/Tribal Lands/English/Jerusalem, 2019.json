            "<i>by Rabbanit Shani Taragin</i>",
            "קוּם הִתְהַלֵּךְ בָּאָרֶץ, לְאָרְכָּהּ וּלְרָחְבָּהּ; כִּי לְךָ, אֶתְּנֶנָּה:: (בראשית יג,יז)",
            "With these words, Hashem directed Avraham Avinu to traverse the Land of Israel from North to South, and West to East to explore the scope of the Land that would be given to his descendants. Today we have the miraculous privilege to walk in the footsteps of Avraham Avinu and to once again fulfill this divine directive – with a Tanakh in hand. It is a true <i>zechut</i> to live, learn, teach, and tour in the Land of Israel today where the stories of our patriarchs and matriarchs come to life, and where the <i>pesukim</i> and <i>parshanut</i> are understood with greater clarity as we explore geographical locale first­hand.",
            "Teaching the stories of <i>Yehoshua</i> atop of <i>Har Gerizim</i>, and the prophecies of <i>Amos</i> from Tekoa while standing in eastern Gush Etzion and Bet-El, inspire by the mere connection of content with context. The Land of Israel has become the classroom and setting, providing accurate scenery, with the Biblical narratives serving as “screen directions” and commentary to picture the events. Inasmuch as I enjoy every moment of sharing the beauty of the scope and depth of the Torah, Nevi’im (Prophets) and Ketuvim (Writings) regardless of location, I feel spiritually energized and religiously reinvigorated when the shiur is taught “on site”. I thank MaTaN (Machon Torani l’Nashim, flagship midrasha for women in Jerusalem) for providing me the opportunity to teach an annual “Learn and Tour” series with esteemed colleagues – teaching students the books of Nevi’im and Ketuvim in the Beit Midrash, followed by <i>shiurim</i> and <i>siyurim “ba’shetach”</i> – encountering and exploring the respective geographical locations of the scenes in the text.",
            "A few years ago, while preparing shiurim for the MaTaN Learn and Tour course, entitled “Yehoshua-Shoftim: Tribes, Traits and Territories,” I recalled an invaluable resource – Tamar Weissman’s <i>Tribal Lands.</i> In previous cycles of teaching the prophecies of Yehoshua and Shoftim, I focused on the narrative and the religious messages extrapolated from the prophet’s textual devices. The prophetic themes accompanying the stories of national and then tribal conquest and settlement in Sefer Yehoshua, through the religious, cultural and political anarchy presented in the book of Shoftim, were taught within the historical and textual context of the respective <i>sefarim</i>. For the new series, however, I decided to employ a different methodology. As I charted the development of the tribes from their initial entrance and conquest of Eretz Yisrael through the challenges of battles and leadership in the period of the Judges, each tribe’s unique “personality” emerged, matured, and ultimately expressed itself within the fabric of national unity. The tribal division of nation and land described in Sefer Yehoshua and revisited in Sefer Shoftim was an essential component to appreciating the complexity and trajectory of forming a nation comprised of multiple traits, strengths and resources. I began to notice patterns of tribal characteristics repeating themselves in the stories spanning hundreds of years, and recognized various allusions to Torah narratives – from the birth stories through the formative development and blessings of the twelve sons of Yaakov Avinu. The interplay between the personal traits evident in Sefer Bereishit and the tribal characteristics manifest throughout Sifrei Shemot, Bamidbar and Devarim, underscored the significance of teaching Yehoshua and Shoftim with particular emphasis placed on the tribal traits and their destined territories in the People and Land of Israel.",
            "As I pursued the study of the personal and tribal distinctive attributes, I found an indispensable resource in Tamar Weissman’s <i>Tribal Lands</i>. Tamar has collected and carefully collated hundreds of sources, incorporating biblical and rabbinic texts into the body of the book, as well as providing copious footnotes that I found invaluable while preparing shiurim. She deftly weaves <i>pshat</i> with midrashic explanation as she traces the emergent identity of the tribal character, meticulously documenting her source material. This sefer provides a framework for appreciating the development of our unique national structure – from tribes with disparate characteristics to a unified nation; I found it a requisite accompanying guide to learning Sifrei Yehoshua and Shoftim from a new perspective.",
            "Tamar introduces her study of connecting the tribes with their respective <i>nachalot</i> in the Land of Israel with a quote from Erich Fromm describing maternal love through the metaphor of our inherent attachment to “mother earth.” I was immediately impressed with this acute analogy and incorporation of semiotics as an expression of <i>Torat Imecha</i> with its dual connotation and significance. Through evoking maternal imagery of a Land flowing with milk and honey, we are sensitively drawn to female characters connected to the Land. We are simultaneously conditioned to appreciate the bond of each of Yaakov’s sons to his respective mother, and subsequently to his respective portion of Land.",
            "The powerful and repetitive description of Eretz Yisrael as <i>zavat chalav u’devash</i> – flowing with milk and honey (appearing sixteen times in the Torah and five times in Nevi’im), is an image we associate with our mothers, who nourish us with their milk, and provide balm for our wounds with the sweetness and therapeutic benefits of honey. The Torah and Nevi’im portray particular women with these qualities; women who restore us as a family and nation to the Land of Israel. The “twinned” <i>Devorah</i>s of Tanach – Devorah the nursemaid of Rivka who appears upon Yaakov’s return to his homeland, and Devorah the prophetess and judge who restores unity and settlement after Canaanite oppression - link these dual elements of milk and honey. Devorah, whose very name means honeybee, is found in both stories under a tree in Bet-El. Devorah the prophetess sits under a date palm associated with the honey of the fruit (thereby reflective of both opinions in the Mekhilta of Rashbi (13,5) regarding the interpretation of “Land of Milk and Honey”. Rabbi Eliezer maintains that both the milk and honey are referring to fruit nectar – the honey from dates. Rabbi Akiva posits that the blessing of milk is from animals and the honey from bees). Devorah <i>meineket</i> Rivka, the nursemaid who provides for milk, is buried under a tree in Bet-El, and Devorah the prophetess sits under the milk/nectar of the date palm and sings the praises of Yael’s heroic assassination of the Canaanite general, Sisera, through her offering of milk. These women remind us of the blessings of Eretz Yisrael as they provide for peaceful settlement in the Land through their feminine qualities and strength.",
            "Though all the <i>shevatim</i> share the same father, Yaakov Avinu, they are conceived, named and nurtured by different mothers. Leah and Rachel fundamentally impacted the individual natures of each child of the Bnei Yisrael, including those sons born by surrogate. Beyond that, they connect us to the Land of Israel, already intimating through their lives and actions the proper regions suited to each of their children. Rachel Immeinu in her life and death, through her beauty, yearnings and disappointments, teaches us the uniqueness of the tribes and territories (<i>nachalot</i>) of Yosef and Binyamin. Rav Yitzchak Arama (in his Commentary <i>Akeidat Yitzchak</i>, Bereishit 9) highlights the dual role of women – as wives and mothers. Rachel epitomizes the wife who yearns to be the mother, and is ultimately remembered as the matriarch who cries for her children (Yirmiyahu 31). Leah’s role in the house of Yaakov, though she mothered multiple sons, is as Yaakov’s wife, and in fact she merits to be buried with her husband in Hevron. Leah’s children are divided on the borders of the Land, protecting the North and South, whereas Rachel’s children are in the center. Rachel, who dies upon entering the Land of Canaan, merits to have her descendant Yehoshua (from the tribe of Ephraim) begin initial conquest of the land. David Hamelekh, a descendant of Yehudah ben Leah who is responsible for selling Rachel’s son Yosef to Egypt, merits to restore and reunite the children of Rachel with the children of Leah through the conquest of Yerushalayim in Nachalat Binyamin, thereby completing the stages initiated by Yehoshua.",
            "Recurring themes, allusions and personality traits manifest through the challenges of unifying the Bnei Yaakov/ Yisrael as tribes to form a nation, drew me towards a renewed understanding and presentation of the messages of Sefer Yehoshua. Teaching the chapters of Yehoshua as the stories of tribal conquest unfold, and continuing through Shoftim, which presents a tribal-based military and judicial system, behooves one to revisit the unique character of every <i>shevet</i> and the qualities of their respective <i>nachalot</i>. To properly appreciate the narratives and messages of <i>Sifrei Tanach,</i> one must learn to explore beyond the developments of the immediate text and consider their broader context. This means approaching a specific <i>parshia</i> (biblical unit) within the context of the particular <i>sefer</i> and then revisit the story/law as it appears throughout Tanakh. The broader context, however, includes the historical and geographical setting; only through the Land may the narrative truly come to life. There was a need for a sefer that would present both of these contexts for the novice and experienced student of Tanakh.",
            "Tamar Weissman masterfully presents all the above throughout the chapters of <i>Tribal Lands</i>. She comprehensively and elegantly traces each tribal character from his genesis through emergence into family clan and tribe, uncovering patterns and revealing undercurrents of personality which are rooted in the earliest musings of our history. One of the more compelling and insightful aspects of each chapter is the suggestion as to why each <i>shevet</i> was granted his particular <i>nachalah</i>. From the outset of the divine promises and covenants of <i>Brit ben Habetarim</i> and <i>Brit Milah</i>, the Land and Nation of Israel are inseparable (see <i>Sefer Hakuzari</i> , 2:3–32). As such, every <i>nachalah</i> in Eretz Yisrael must be appreciated with all of its facets – geographical, topographical, geological, and botanical – for each is an essential expression of tribal identity. The Land is evocative, Tamar writes, and this is very true; the different regions of Eretz Yisrael affect and influence the development of personality, and certain personalities are drawn to specific landscapes. This was certainly the case with the tribes, and it is fascinating to explore how a landscape’s particular attributes, advantages and drawbacks impact the tribal character throughout history.",
            "Rav Avraham Yitzchak HaKohen Kook elaborates upon the symbiotic connection between Land and Tribe as first evident by unique tribal flags in the desert encampment; as with each tribe, he writes, so too with each individual member of Knesset Yisrael. “The Land of Israel is suitable for the Knesset as a whole, throughout the generations, forever and forever, and yet it is also suited to the lives of all individuals, to every single individual in Israel, according to his or her value. And the adaptation is so precise that even the amazingness and proportion of the Land of Israel . . . is all fitting in the supreme direction from the hand of God to His holy people.” (Olat HaRAY”H 1, p.203)",
            "Tribes, composed of family clans and members, feel a draw and attachment to a particular piece of Land. Moshe Rabbeinu sent representatives of each tribe who were experts in geography and geology (Seforno Bamidbar 13:2) to scout the Land of Israel and choose the location most befitting their tribe. Subsequently each family and individual would choose their plot of land, as Calev ben Yefuneh chose the city of Hevron and Yosef’s descendants initiated conquest surrounding their namesake’s burial plot and inheritance in Shechem. I remember my first trip to Eretz Yisrael at twelve years old, when I encountered the remarkable countryside that I would eventually call home. My family’s visit to Alon Shvut, Gush Etzion was on a particularly foggy day in Tishrei (not uncommon in the Judean hills), and all I could see was the top of the “eagle’s head” of Yeshivat Har Etzion as we made our way from Yerushalayim in the direction of Hevron. For the first time, I could literally picture the path of Avraham as he made his way from Bet-El to Hevron and Be’er Sheva. I could feel Yaakov’s anxiety trying to find his way along the rocky path escaping from his bloodthirsty brother, Esav. There was an immediate attraction and a connection to “Derech ha’Avot” (the path of our Patriarchs) already then, and I instinctively knew that I belonged in the hills of Yehudah.",
            "Six years later I returned to study in Yerushalayim, but spent many hours learning with my husband­to-be in Yeshivat Har Etzion, hosted by families who are today among my closest friends. The women’s section in Yeshiva was my Beit Midrash, and the parks of Alon Shvut became my backyard. Together with my husband Reuven, we raised our family and built our home overlooking the same breathtaking panoramas that inspired David as he composed his Tehillim. Our favorite <i>tiyulim</i> include swimming /immersing in the same nearby springs as our ancestors did on their way to Yerushalayim for Aliyah La’regel.",
            "One can feel the depth of Am Yisrael’s roots here in Nachalat Yehudah, and a particular connection as a descendant of Yehudah who was gifted by his father Yaakov with the ancestral homes of Hevron and Beer Sheva. Yaakov informed Yehudah that he will inherit a region saturated with vineyards and pastureland:",
            "חַכְלִילִי עֵינַיִם, מִיָּיִן; וּלְבֶן־שִׁנַּיִם, מֵחָלָב:: (בראשית מט, כא)",
            "Yehudah’s eyes shall be colored as wine, and his teeth whitened with milk.",
            "Nachmanides explains that Yehudah’s eyes will not be red with intoxication (see Rashi, Ibn Ezra, RaDaK), but rather colored with wine; just as others paint (their eyes) with eye paint, which in Arabic is <i>el kachul</i>, Yehudah paints them with wine; others whiten their teeth with ointments, Yehudah whitens them with milk – this is to highlight the abundance of wine and milk in Yehudah’s <i>nachalah</i> (Ramban Bereishit 49:12). Yehudah is blessed with two divergent topographies and colors – the steep hills perfect for terraced vineyards depicting the blue of oxidized wine, and the Judean wilderness, a rock desert for grazing animals who will produce white milk.",
            "Rav Ya’akov Medan, Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshivat Har Etzion, notes via this commentary of Ramban that Yehudah’s <i>beracha</i> contains the first reference to the central colors of Eretz Yisrael; he is granted the blessings of a landscape that features both “<i>kachol/techelet</i>” (blue of the mountain wine) and <i>lavan</i> (white of the goat milk). The dialectic between concrete clarity (symbolized by white), and the abstract metaphysical (symbolized by <i>techelet)</i>, is ever­present in my world, and resonates deeply here in the Judean hills. The colors of Yehudah’s <i>nachalah</i> are the colors of the <i>tzitzit,</i> reminding us after the sin of the <i>meraglim</i> not to veer from our promised homeland and destiny. They are the colors of the miraculous return of Am Yisrael to Eretz Yisrael in our present day, boldly displayed like a tallit on our national flag proudly waving over the citadels and hilltops of Gush Etzion, resettled immediately after the Six Day War.",
            "This tension propels the endless passionate relationship between Am Yisrael and Hashem. Shir haShirim, the paradigmatic love song between God and His people, unfolds in the landscape of Nachalat Yehudah; the female persona – <i>Ra’ayah</i> (Yisrael) resides in the hills of Yerushalayim, and her Beloved/ <i>Dod</i> (God) is described as emerging from the vineyards of Ein Gedi, an oasis in <i>Midbar Yehudah</i>. The hills of Judea and the Judean desert evoke an intensity which drew the Avot, David HaMelech, generations of scholars and poets, and hundreds of leaders in our own time to this region. Avraham Avinu envisioned Mt. Moriah as he was climbing the hills of my home – וירא את המקום מרחוק. Here in Nachalat Yehudah we wake up in the mountain clouds, wrap ourselves in <i>kachol v’lavan</i>, and strive to glimpse HaMakom, yearning to draw close to Him. We feel the ever­present vicissitudes of the love relationship between God and Am Yisrael, and a topographical romance between Nation and Land. Perhaps this is why the three oaths of Shir HaShirim serve as the basis of debate between Rav Yehudah and his student Rabbi Zeira regarding the permissibility of return to Eretz Yisrael. This discussion and the continued explanations of ChaZal regarding the physical and spiritual beauty of the Land of Israel are compiled in the Talmudic tractate of Ketubot – which discusses the laws of the marriage contract given by a groom to his bride. This is indicative of our “marriage” with God – the Land of Israel serves as the <i>Ketuba</i> – the “marriage contract” between God and His beautiful nation.",
            "The <i>chuppah</i> (bridal canopy) is the Mikdash in Yerushalayim – bringing the <i>Dod</i> and <i>Ra’ayah</i> of Nachalat Yehudah together while simultaneously bridging the children of Leah (i.e. Yehudah) with the children of Rachel (Yosef and Binyamin – see Tamar’s insights in the respective chapters). Yehudah is the vanguard of Yisrael, and his <i>nachalah</i> represents the transition in development from one stage of leadership and nationhood to the next. The era of our Avot began here with Avraham’s purchase of the first realestate of the Machpela field, and concluded here as Yaakov left Hevron to reunite with Yosef in Egypt; Calev ben Yefuneh, prince of Yehudah, charted the land and sought patriarchal inspiration from Hevron encouraging us – against the dismissive reports of the spies – to conquer and settle the Land promised by Hashem:",
            "עָלֹה נַעֲלֶה וְיָרַשְׁנוּ אֹתָהּ; כִּי־יָכוֹל נוּכַל, לָהּ:: (במדבר יג, ל)",
            "We should go up at once, and possess it, for we are well able to overcome it.",
            "Hashem responds to the nation’s request for a leader in battle with an echo of Calev’s cry – “Yehudah ya’aleh!,” imbuing this <i>shevet</i> with a tradition of leadership that is realized within the contours of this <i>nachalah</i> – <i>bayamim ha’hem, bazman hazeh</i> (in those days, and in ours). This <i>nachalah</i> is and always was the place of Yisrael’s transition to <i>malchut</i>, with Yehudah at the helm. David ruled as king in Hevron for seven years before his coronation over all of Israel in Yerushalayim. R’ Amital z”l saw the revival of Gush Etzion as a catalyst for future growth and expansion. He, together with Rav Aharon Lichtenstein z”l, believed in and built institutions of Torah scholarship for both men and women, a contemporary manifestation of the tent of Otniel ben Kenaz and his wife Achsa, the pioneering daughter of Calev. Indeed, there is a remarkable concentration today of yeshivot, ulpanot and midrashot between Hevron and Yerushalayim, <i>batei midrash</i> resonating with enthusiastic Torah learning, where characteristics central to leadership and royalty are cultivated.",
            "This is my <i>nachalah</i> – my space, my place, my home founded on the Torah and values of Tanakh, that defines my religious-national relationship with Hashem, within Am Yisrael and Eretz Yisrael, through the past and toward the future; this is why Tamar Weissman’s <i>Tribal Lands</i> resonated so strongly with me. Studying the nature of the <i>shevatim</i> in Tanakh opens one’s mind and heart to the broader religious messages, history and trajectory of our nation. Today’s <i>Yehudi/Yisraeli</i> can and should deeply appreciate the very natural, organic relationship of the Jew to his land. It is imperative that every Jew, whether he is living and resettling our ancestral land, or whether he does not yet have that opportunity, nurture and deepen his own particular connection to Eretz Yisrael in text and context. Tamar has shared her scholarship, insight and experience in linking tribal character to <i>nachalah</i> character. She has equipped us with the <i>pesukim</i>, midrashim and <i>parshanut</i> to traverse the Land with Tankah in hand, mind and heart, and then has illustratively taken us to virtually tour the <i>nachalot</i> of past and present. This exceptional sefer helps the reader to discover narratives and landscapes anew, opening our eyes to inspiring new encounters with the tapestry of Torat Yisrael and Eretz Yisrael.",

            "The difference between a grant (<i>hakna’ah</i>) and a legacy (<i>hanĥalah</i>) is vast. A grantor indeed transfers the object to the possession of the grantee, but such a transfer does not create a personal relationship or internal bond between the grantor and grantee. This is not true of a legacy. There, the benefactor appoints the beneficiary in his stead, and the beneficiary assumes the status of his benefactor. Thus, a legacy forges an intimate relationship between benefactor and beneficiary.",
            "<small>This is the novel idea expressed by the verse “Honor is the legacy of the wise” (Proverbs 3:35). The verse teaches us that wisdom does not simply <i>grant</i> honor to the wise; rather, wisdom gives honor as a <i>legacy</i> to those who possess it.<br>Rabbi Yitzhak Hutner, <i>Paĥad Yitzĥak </i>(<i>Shavuot</i>), 16:10</small>",
            "What I present here is not an academic study, or a travel guide, or a biblical commentary. It is, rather, an act of committing to record years of reflection on the dynamic interplay between text and land.",
            "This book was born in the Judean Desert, at the northern tip of the Dead Sea. I was guiding a group through the ruins of Qumran, the ancient commune whose residents wrote and stashed the famous Dead Sea Scrolls in the surrounding limestone caves two thousand years ago. Much of my daily work involved this era of Jewish history, when sects fought for control of the Second Temple and the Roman threat of conquest loomed large.",
            "It was during the ice cream break that I suddenly had intimations of a new direction for research and thought. I had turned my back to the caves for a few minutes, gazing out over the Dead Sea to the mountains beyond. Moabite, Amorite, Ammonite, I recited to myself, automatically checking off the range of ancient civilizations that had dwelled in those hills. Israelite…the tribes of Reuben and Gad – and then, the fleeting thought that would reframe my presentation of the Land of Israel and influence my work for the next few years: a land divided among tribes must reflect in its apportionment the varied personalities of its owners.",
            "There is something preternaturally intimate in the Bible’s presentation of a person’s relationship to the land. When Jacob fled the wrath of his slighted brother, Esau, he <i>encountered</i> the place where he was to camp for the night: “<i>va-yifga ba-makom</i>” (Genesis 28:11). Encountering implies something more than casual meeting; it implies confrontation, contact – a rendezvous with an entity that intrigues us with its mystery, yet is comfortingly familiar at the same time. Those who encounter the land have a relationship with the land.",
            "I believe this highlights an essential truth. Every person yearns to encounter the land; it is as natural as the relationship between mother and child: “for from dust were you taken, and to dust shall you return.” What is it that we are truly seeking from mother, and from land? Erich Fromm explains that mother does far more than preserve the child’s life and growth, but “instills in the child a love for living, which gives him the feeling: it is good to be alive, it is good to be a little boy or girl, it is good to be on this earth!”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Erich Fromm, <i>The Art of Loving</i> (Cambridge, MA: Harper, 2006), 50.</i>",
            "Fromm himself used land as an apt metaphor to describe a mother’s love:",
            "The promised land (land is always a mother symbol) is described as “flowing with milk and honey.” Milk is the symbol of the first act of love, that of caring and affirmation. Honey symbolizes the sweetness of life, the love for it and the happiness in being alive.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ibid.</i>",
            "Mother, our first and most primal relationship, gives us both sustenance and joie de vivre. Land does the same. How good it is to be on this earth! This joyous sense is heightened for the Children of Israel in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, the archetypal land of “milk and honey” – of abundant blessings and sweet meaningfulness. They are not only sustained through their land; they find the sweet contentedness of <i>home</i> in her borders, as right and as at home as in their mother’s embrace.",
            "And yet it is not only the primal connection to the earth that is part of the human condition; we are also drawn to a particular place because of its qualities, some quantifiable, some nebulously sensed. As I gazed across the sea at <i>Naĥalat Reuven</i>, the region of the ancestral homeland apportioned to the tribe descended from Jacob’s son Reuben, I wondered about all twelve of these regions, <i>naĥalot</i>, and the tribes who dwelled therein. Was there some essential connection between the individual natures of the tribes and the territory each called its own? Did each tribe feel that maternal sense of rightness in its own territory, and not in the others? The diminutive swath of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> offers mountain and desert, coast and plain. Different parts of the land inspire and resonate in different ways. From my vantage point in <i>Naĥalat Yehudah</i>, I speculated: perhaps the specific tract of land allotted to each tribe resonated with that tribe’s particular culture. Perhaps there was a design to the land apportionment, rooted in the different characters of each tribe.",
            "Jewish tradition seems to take for granted that it is so. At the closing of the Book of Genesis, as Jacob blessed each son in turn, the blessing was not for the person standing before him, but for the entire tribe that each son was to sire. Each tribe’s destiny was couched in this encounter between father and son: “Gather and I will tell you what will befall you at the end of days” (Genesis 48:1). Future descendants of each of Jacob’s twelve sons acquired (and sometimes overcame) the same characteristic behavioral traits as their forefather, and patterns established in the lives of the original sons emerged again in later generations. Moses’s blessings, at the end of the Book of Deuteronomy, echoed those bestowed by Jacob, often reinforcing the particular message, sometimes altering the vision based on events that had transpired. These two sets of blessings defined the essence of each tribe, and the allusions within the blessings to their specific land allotments implied a unity of destiny, character, and <i>naĥalah</i>.",
            "Thus, the apportionment of the <i>naĥalot </i>was neither haphazard nor primarily politically motivated. The more dominant and populous tribes received larger tracts, as the verse in Numbers commanded: “Let the numerous one receive a bigger allotment, and the smaller one, a smaller allotment; each one according to his count shall his <i>naĥalah </i>be given” (26:54). But this kind of pragmatism was not the sum and total consideration when divvying up the land. If it were, why would God Himself need to have been involved?",
            "<small>Only by <i>goral</i> [lots] shall the land be divided; according to the names of their fathers’ tribes shall they inherit. According to the lot shall one’s <i>naĥalah</i> be divided, between the numerous and the few.<br>Numbers 26:55–56</small>",
            "This <i>goral</i> method was a divine lottery of sorts, as expanded upon in the Talmud:",
            "<small>And it [the Land] was only divided by lot, as it is said, “By lot shall the land be divided” (Numbers 26:55). It was only divided by way of the <i>Urim ve-Tumim</i>.…<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Urim ve-Tumim</i> was a divination method utilizing the high priest’s breastplate.</i> How was this effected? Elazar (the high priest) was wearing the <i>Urim ve-Tumim</i> while Joshua and all Israel stood before him. An urn [containing the names] of the tribes and an urn containing descriptions of the boundaries were placed before him. Guided by divine inspiration, he gave directions, exclaiming: “Zebulun will be drawn and the boundary lines of Acco will be drawn!” He then vigorously shook the urn of the tribes and Zebulun came up in his hand. He vigorously shook the urn of the boundaries and the boundary lines of Acco came up in his hand.

            "I set to researching the connections between <i>shevet</i> (tribe) and <i>naĥalah</i> by first investigating the character of each tribe and its patriarch. As my course of study developed, I discovered that each tribe had an identifiable personality, with dominant, definitive traits. Nature and nurture worked in tandem to form the biblical personality, so elements like birth order, formative circumstances, and family dynamics influenced each son of Jacob as much as innate, raw abilities, tendencies, and weaknesses did. As I sifted through the rabbinic material, as well as other ancient sources, such as the Apocryphal literature and exegetical works of Josephus and Philo, emergent recurrent motifs allowed me to assign to each tribe a specific trait based on the nature of its founding father. No character portrait can ignore the complexities inherent to the human personality, but each tribe can be typified by one essential trait. I then examined the character of the tribe’s <i>naĥalah</i>, which in turn led me to explore possible historical and conceptual ties of the tribe to its particular land holdings.",
            "Given these considerations, this work is based in no small part on the Talmudic approach above that the <i>naĥalot</i> were apportioned by divine hand, implying that the specific qualities of any given <i>naĥalah</i> were perfectly suited to those who dwelled within it. But even for those who cannot accept the doctrine of divine allotment, recognition of a certain connection between a region and those who inhabit it justifies an examination into the nature of that connection. Setting aside the philosophical pickle of whether the territory inspired the tribe or the tribe inspired the territory, we may begin to examine the underlying bonds between the tribe and its <i>naĥalah</i>.",

Without the division into diverse tribes, all distinctiveness would be absorbed in the consolidated mass of the nation as a whole, just as the land would be divided among the nation as a whole and not according to different tribes.<br>Hirsch, Genesis 48:3–6</small>",

David P. Wright, David N.

They are also known for nursing their resentments quietly, and then venting with one grand explosion” (ibid., 82).</i> That the text places this episode directly after the story of Rachel’s death intimates a link between the two events. The midrash above fills in the details: a suffering son, driven by his maternal fealty to revenge. Father undermined Mother? Well, I’ll undermine him!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is also possible that sleeping with Bilhah, a clear <i>arayot</i> (incestuous) transgression, was a calculated move to drive a wedge between Jacob and Bilhah, and not just intended as a grave insult to Jacob.</i>",
            "What Jacob thought of this all played out over the rest of the Book of Genesis, sometimes tantalizingly, in the empty spaces within the stories, and sometimes with explicit directness. The text tells us that immediately after Reuben sinned with Bilhah, Jacob heard of the matter. We are not privy to more than that dry fact, but we do know that immediately afterwards, the verses list Jacob’s sons, placing Reuben first – and a telling addition to his name: “Reuben – <i>Jacob’s firstborn</i> – Simeon, Levi, Judah… ” (Genesis 35:23).

They are the first to bear the brunt of her love, of her disappointment, of her dreams. The firstborn opens the woman, and then she is a mother. Forever after, she will always be a mother, and the child has made her so. And this first child feels the full force of the mother’s stumbling attempts to learn how to mother. If the mother is successful, the child will fiercely love her back.",

Reuben, they say, did not need to wait the long years until his father’s death to feel the wrongness of his deed and the seriousness of his infraction.

He fashioned himself as head of the brothers, envisioning his role as central and superior within the family hierarchy – even his parents would be subject to his leadership. Joseph shared his dreams with his family, perhaps in the naiveté of youth, perhaps to provoke, and the brothers banded against him. Whipped into jealous frenzy, the brothers conspired to kill Joseph as they saw him approaching from afar. Reuben, whose role Joseph threatened directly and whom we therefore would expect to see heading this cabal, instead jumped to intercede: “Let us not take his life!…Do not shed his blood, rather cast him into this pit in the wilderness, but do not touch him yourselves” (Genesis 37:21–22).",

            "It should be noted that Reuben had matured some since his youthful defiance. In this episode, we see a more cautious Reuben, a more responsible one, who waited things out and tried to temper the rashness of his brothers.

            "<b><i>Another Shot at Redemption</i></b><br>Another opportunity for Reuben to redeem himself arrived years later. The story: a famine tore the land. The famished brothers were sent down to Egypt by Jacob to find food. They found themselves accused of espionage by the vizier of Egypt (we, the readers, know that this is the disguised Joseph), who held Simeon hostage until the brothers returned with Benjamin. Awareness of the cause of their dire situation – their callous sale of Joseph – dawned on the brothers, and they began to repent their past misdeeds. Reuben, haunted for many years by this failure, burst out: “Did I not tell you, ‘Do no wrong to the boy,’ but you would not listen! Now comes the reckoning for his blood” (Genesis 42:22).",
            "The brothers unwillingly left Simeon in Egypt and returned to Jacob. But Jacob would not relinquish Benjamin into his brothers’ care. They had already been involved in the shadiest of affairs, the apparent death of Joseph. Nor did Jacob trust this new Egyptian vizier. His vision of a nation composed of all twelve of his sons was crumbling, and he was in despair: “You have bereaved me! Joseph is no more; Simeon is no more. And now you would take away Benjamin?! These things always happen to me!” (Genesis 42:36). Here again Reuben tried to lead, to take responsibility. He deliriously bargained with his father: “You may kill my two sons if I do not bring him back to you. Hold me responsible; I shall return him!” (Genesis 42:37).",
            "Driven to extremes, Reuben exposed his distress in all of its complexity. The insanity of Reuben’s offer causes the reader – and the text – to stop short. We are relieved that the text compassionately omits Jacob’s response, sparing us (and Reuben) head-on exposure to Reuben’s pain. Yet Jacob’s reaction is implicit in his contemptuous refusal to respond – and his repeated refusal to part with Benjamin. In the midrash’s words: “A foolish firstborn! Doesn’t he realize that his sons are my grandsons, and their deaths will bring me pain like the deaths of my children are paining me?!” (<i>Genesis Rabbah</i> 91:9).",
            "But that was the painful truth embedded in Reuben’s mad offer: he truly did not realize that his sons were Jacob’s grandsons. Reuben believed that Jacob did not care about his grandsons from Leah’s children, that only Rachel’s children counted. He thought that Jacob was willing to act to protect Benjamin, but not Simeon; that Jacob mourned Joseph, but would not mourn Reuben’s children.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I am grateful to Batnadiv HaKarmi-Weinberg for drawing my attention to this subtext.</i> Deeply rooted anxiety was Reuben’s birthright – “God saw that Leah was hated, so He granted her a son” to begin building her relationship with Jacob – and it never dissipated.",

Think back to those faint echoes of Reuben’s future as his mother Leah bestowed upon him the heaviness of his name: see, a son who might grow to be unlike the other rejected firstborns in Abraham’s family! Isaac, the younger son of Abraham, was chosen over firstborn Ishmael. Jacob, the younger son of Isaac, was chosen over firstborn Esau. Even Rachel, younger sister to Leah, was the favored one. Reuben certainly knew that being the firstborn did not guarantee the scepter. Whatever heightened anxieties he may have had prior to his sin with Bilhah were exacerbated by his father’s distant silence after the fact, and as much as he sought to prove himself, he alone sabotaged every effort. He could not lead – but he could repent.",

We will not return to our homes until every one of the Israelites is in possession of his portion” (Numbers 32:17–18).

            "The explanation provided by the text for why Reuben was attracted to the Transjordan is straightforward: this region was appropriate for the tribe’s needs: wide-open flatlands, good for grazing large herds. They had been told that across the river lay difficult terrain of sharp mountains and steep valleys, a terrain that was worrisome to cattle farmers. This safer, known area, east of the Dead Sea, called to them. Could there have been other reasons, though, for Reuben’s preference?",
            "To determine this, we must expand on the geography and history of the Transjordanian plateau, home to the two and a half tribes of the Kingdom of Israel who chose their territory east of the Jordan.",
            "There is a fairly narrow north–south strip of land starting just south of the basalt Golan Heights that runs all the way down to the Gulf of Aqaba and empties into the Red Sea. This strip constitutes a small portion of the eastern rim of the Syro-African Rift, a fault line stretching more than 6,000 kilometers (approx. 3,700 miles). It is bordered on the west by the deep rift itself, plunging at its lowest point into the Dead Sea, and, on the east, by vast tracts of desert. The strip is essentially a highland plateau, severed into defined geographical units by a series of east–west canyons formed by ancient rivers rushing west toward the Jordan River. Of the four main rivers, the Yarmuk is northernmost, severing the Golan Heights in the north from the Transjordan Plateau. Next is the Jabbok (Nahr ez-Zerqa), emptying into the Jordan River about halfway down the Rift Valley, between the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea. Then there is the mighty Arnon (Wadi el-Mujib), which spills into the Dead Sea. More south still is the Zered riverbed (Wadi el-Ĥesa), at the southernmost tip of the Dead Sea. The highland plateau can be divided into tracts formed by these great wadis.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See map insert for further reference.</i>",
            "Running north through the highland plateau is a leg of the most famous route in antiquity: the King’s Highway. This road, extant for thousands of years and serving all ancient peoples, broadly makes up one critical tract of the tortuous route linking Africa and Asia, or Egypt and Mesopotamia.",
            "This highland plateau, broken up by these rivers, is the region of Reuben, Gad, and half of the tribe of Manasseh. Broadly put, Manasseh dwelt in the mountainous Gilead region between the Yarmuk and the Jabbok (as well as north, beyond the Yarmuk, in the large area known as the Bashan; see chapter 13 on Manasseh for further detail). Gad claimed the midsection, spanning south of the Jabbok and culminating at the Plains of Moab, a yawning stretch of land facing the oasis city of Jericho. The Plains of Moab also formed the northern border of Reuben, whose <i>naĥalah</i> extended south until the Arnon. The bulk of terrain within the <i>naĥalot</i> of Reuben and Gad was the broad, flat expanse of level tableland on the highland plateau, known in the Bible as the <i>Mishor</i>.",
            "The <i>Mishor</i>, the Plains of Moab, and the mountains of Gilead to the north were all conquered in a war fought by Israel prior to entering the Land of Israel. The lands originally belonged to the Amorites, and stretched from the River Jabbok down south to the River Arnon. Numbers 21 contains the account of the confrontation, beginning with polite overtures by the Israelites toward Sihon, the Amorite king, to allow them to continue north on portions of the King’s Highway that ran through Amorite territory (this territory had at one time belonged to Moab; Sihon had taken it in battle). Sihon refused, opting to drive the Israelites away, but he was roundly defeated and his lands fell in their entirety to the Israelites. Bolstered by their resounding victory, the Israelites headed north and defeated Og, king of Bashan, probably also an Amorite king, and conquered the Gilead and lands to the north. Thus, the entire strip of highlands, from the Hermon, north of the Golan Heights, down to the River Arnon, came to be in the possession of the Israelites.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 21:21–35.</i>",

The Mesha Stele itself contains apparent reference to “<i>tzon ha-aretz</i>” (the sheep of the land) – the region in context being the <i>Mishor</i>. For more on the Mesha Stele, see “Visiting <i>Naĥalot Reuven ve-Gad</i>” in this chapter, and see chapter 2.</i> The climate, heavily influenced by the desert to the east and by the steep slopes descending to the Jordan River and Dead Sea to the west, produced conditions favorable to ranching and agriculture.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“[The] high ridges arrest and cool the atmosphere, causing the large amount of rainfall which most parts of Transjordan enjoy.… Burning siroccos in the spring and fall, and icy desert winds in winter sweep undisturbed over the tableland, rendering most difficult the cultivation of olive groves and vineyards, which are so common in western Palestine. The character of the country is therefore mainly pastoral, and wherever rain is sufficient wheat is the primary crop.” Yohanan Aharoni, <i>The Land of the Bible</i> (Philadelphia: The Westminster Press, 1979), 36.</i> What else was appealing to them?",
            "First, the region had sufficient freshwater sources. The Transjordan highland plateau is made of limestone layered on Nubian sandstone. Sandstone is not porous; thus, even if the bulk of the limestone was worn away by the many perennial rivers flowing westward from the watershed, the sandstone remained and allowed for significant surface water.",
            "Additionally, the swath of King’s Highway running through the land might have been a considerable attraction to tribes that were to have little access to the major urban centers of their brethren to the west. Reuben and Gad were essentially on their own and benefitted from the caravanserai that wended their way up from Arabia toward Damascus and paid for the use of the King’s Highway. Not to be underestimated was the strategic advantage of controlling the road for purposes of national income and defense.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although they could not have known this yet, the tribes that settled in the Transjordan were to play a critical role during the United Monarchy of David and Solomon, when they were forced to defend Israelite control over the King’s Highway from Damascus’s onslaughts (II Kings 10:33, 16:6).</i>",
            "It is possible that Reuben and Gad’s decision to angle for this region was ideologically motivated. Even then, Israel needed a buffer from the enemies of the east: Ammon, Moab, and Midian. Much as today’s Israeli residents of the Jordan Valley see themselves as serving their nation by forming that defensive zone, Reuben and Gad did the same for their brothers. This would be another nod to the suggestion that Reuben assumed his natural responsibility as oldest brother to protect the family: not just to settle them in their respective <i>naĥalot</i>, but to always stand guard against the great eastern threat. Considering the location of Gad’s cities, and by extension, Gad’s assumed role as the nation’s warriors,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See “Gad, the Confident Warrior,” in chapter 10.</i> much of the task of defense was the purview of that tribe, but we must not overlook Reuben’s association with Gad and their potential role in helping Gad fend off Israel’s enemies.",
            "Another motive, though beyond the cattle issue the text is silent, so we can only surmise: perhaps the natures of these tribes, Reuben in particular, were drawn to the relative seclusion and privacy afforded by the Transjordan. The consistent primacy of Joseph and Judah in the tribal hierarchy must surely have stung those who definitively lost a confirmed leadership role in the tribal confederacy, even assuming that they made their peace with it. Maintaining a respectful distance from the constant reminder of what they lost may have been desirable.",
            "Furthermore: there are striking parallels between Reuben and the indigenous Moabite population of this region that tantalize us with prospects of emergent patterns.

This dovetails nicely with the detail offered by I Chronicles 5:9–10 that already in the early kingdom of Saul, the Reubenites had devolved into a semi-nomadic and less-organized existence, perhaps neglecting their cities and then eventually abandoning them entirely.</i>",
            "The biblical history of this region was reminiscent in these peoples, both descended from firstborns, the tribe of Reuben and the nation Moab.

Perhaps Reuben never bothered; though the tribe chose marginalization over mainstream, they demonstrated no disloyalty to the seat of Israel’s administration in the west by organizing into anything but small municipalities. There was no ambition to do much beyond the stated commitments: fight Israel’s battles and graze the cattle. There is passing reference to the tribe in I Chronicles 5:9 as having eventually resigned themselves to an almost fully nomadic existence, eschewing urban development: “He also dwelled toward the east, as far as the edge of the wilderness, this side of the Euphrates, because their cattle had increased in the land of Gilead.

This difficult-to-decipher inscription was painted on a plastered wall and recovered in 119 pieces.

Eastward, past the small dam, the river skips moderately in its narrow course, as the low hills of Gilead begin to rise from the Jordan Valley.

Jordan is still developing a Dead Sea resort area of sorts, with luxury hotels and lush grounds basking in the relentless and unique heat of the lowest point on earth.

At times, the ground looks littered with millions of dark debris sherds, and hot springs bubble up from the region clearly marked by volcanic activity. This all belonged to Reuben, but it is hard to imagine an ancient people making much use of this stark landscape. It was majestic and primal, defining the western boundary of the <i>Mishor</i> as a forbidding, dark escarpment. If this had been the only way to access Canaan, then Reuben and Gad would have been entirely cut off from any contact with the other tribes. We know, though, that traffic passed between the two sides of the Jordan through the more moderate and traversable northern plains of the Jordan Valley.",

This is not yet the classic flat plateau that Reuben and Gad so desired and that we are expecting; rather, the southern <i>Mishor</i> was built of gentle hills of grain on a land cut through with frighteningly deep canyons of wadis. We saw the impressive Wadi Zarqa Ma’in on our ascent up from the Dead Sea to the <i>Mishor</i>; now we head south to inspect the majestic gorge of Wadi el-Mujib, the Arnon riverbed, which marks the natural border between Reuben and the Kingdom of Moab.",

            "As with the arresting cliffs on the east of Reuben’s <i>naĥalah</i>, the Arnon gorge brings pause. Reflection on the broad span of this tribe’s portion, mainly calm but decidedly dramatic at times, evokes associations with the character of Reuben. How delightful that the calm and fertile <i>Mishor</i>, which made up the bulk of this tribe’s <i>naĥalah</i>, can be considered to reflect Reuben’s pragmatic side (“The land that the Lord has conquered for the congregation of Israel is cattle country – and your servants have cattle!

No signs point to the abandoned tel; it does not sit on a main road and is not regularly visited. For all its contemporary anonymity, Tel Dibon retains the fame of its prized Iron Age remains: massive fortifications, including stretches of a ten-meter-high wall (approx. thirty-three feet high) from the ninth century Bce, and the discovery of the Mesha Stele, the victory inscription commissioned by King Mesha of Moab, who ruled from Dibon, to mark his military successes against the House of Omri, the Israelite king.",
            "This city, unrestored and unremarkable in its present state, was a critical holding of the Moabite kingdom once it was captured from Gad. Mesha had much to boast about his military campaign in this region. He bragged of conquering neighboring Ataroth from the men of Gad, and of reconstituting nearby Aroer, which at one time had belonged to the Israelites. In this southern swath of <i>Naĥalat</i> <i>Reuven</i>, we see the constant tensions at play between the Moabites and the Israelites, as well as the emergent dominance of Gad as the central Israelite presence in the <i>Mishor</i>.",
            "From Dibon north into the heartland of Reuben, the appeal of the landscape is clear. Grazing lands and wheat fields abound. And of course the ancient King’s Highway ran straight through this plain – Dibon and Medeba were both stations on that critical route.

            "The difficulties determining the exact boundaries of areas apportioned to the two and a half tribes in the Transjordan stem primarily from textual discrepancies. Take, for instance, the description of Reuben’s <i>naĥalah </i>in Numbers 32:33, 37–38:",
            "So Moses assigned to them – to Gad, Reuben, and the half-tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph – the kingdom of Sihon, king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og, king of Bashan, the land with its various cities and the territories of their surrounding towns.…Reuben rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim, Nebo, and Baal-meon – some names being changed<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi suggested that Nebo and Baal-meon were originally named in honor of Amorite gods, hence Reuben saw fit to change to more appropriate names.

            "The two key Amorite cities, Heshbon and Jazer, were allocated respectively to Reuben and Gad. The third principle city in this region to dominate the King’s Highway was Rabbath-bene-ammon; intractable, it remained the capital of the Kingdom of Ammon.",
            "The layout of the cities as they were divided in Numbers presented Reuben as almost cushioned within Gad’s territory, which was arranged in a sort of bow around the cities given to Reuben. Gad formed a northern, southern, and western perimeter around Reuben, whose cities sat toward the interior of the <i>Mishor</i>. Perhaps this division of cities was by design, drawing upon the innate character of Gad as the natural warriors who successfully defended the Israelites dwelling in the region against nations invading from the north (Ammonites), south (Moabites), and west (Canaanites). Further, textual evidence indicates that the Gadite cities were fortified against the enemy,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 32:36. זאב (ז׳אבו) ארליך, <i>מזרח הירדן ממבט יהודי </i>(דפוס מוריה, תשנ״ו), 157.</i> a detail that remains unclear with regard to Reuben’s cities.

In a later period, the Midianites again attacked the Israelites, but the division of cities in Numbers 32 did not reflect that situation.</i>",
            "To these cities of Reuben were added another four, delineated in I Chronicles 6:63–64, that were designated as cities of Levi located in <i>Naĥalat Reuven</i>. These four cities, like all of those granted to Levi, were cities of refuge. They lay further inland on the <i>Mishor</i>, forming an eastern boundary of Reuben’s territory.",
            "A competing version of the portion divisions is found in Joshua 13:15–23. In that narrative, Gad sat squarely to the north of Reuben, and Reuben’s <i>naĥalah </i>included such southern cities as Dibon and Aroer, which were assigned to Gad in the Numbers 32 version. Also, the southern cities Ataroth and Atroth-shophan, both inhabited by Gad in Numbers 32, were mentioned nowhere in the Joshua 13 list, though implicitly they shared the same fate as Dibon and Aroer, since they were present in the general description of Reuben’s <i>naĥalah</i>:",
            "<small>Their [Reuben’s] border was from Aroer that is on the edge of the River Arnon and the city that is in the middle of the river, and all the span of the <i>Mishor</i> until Medeba; Heshbon and all of its cities that are in the plain – Dibon and Bamoth-baal and Beth-baal-meon.…<br>Joshua 13:16–17</small>",
            "Thus, in the Book of Joshua, Reuben was allotted a much larger portion, spanning the entire <i>Mishor</i>: from the Arnon riverbed in the south up to Nebo and Heshbon in the north (both of which sat due east of the Plains of Moab), bordered on the west by the Dead Sea and on the east by the vast desert. The land division in Numbers had Gad on the volatile eastern and southern borders, while the Joshua version left Gad to contend only with Ammon on its eastern flank. The Joshua version saddled Reuben with sole defense of their southern border against the Moabites agitating just south of the Arnon.",
            "To compound the difficulties presented by the competing narratives, an extra-biblical source of tremendous importance to the region offers yet another variation. The Mesha Stele, discovered in 1868 in Dibon, a city allotted to Gad in Numbers 32 and to Reuben in Joshua 13, is definitively dated to the ninth century Bce. The stele was a victory monument commissioned by Mesha, the king of Moab, to consecrate his victory over an Israelite king from the House of Omri. Aside from its relative importance in providing an extra-biblical corollary to II Kings 3, the Mesha Stele offers another glimpse into territorial division in the Transjordan. It boasts, for instance, of having captured the city of Ataroth away from Israel:",

            "Ataroth, slightly north of the Arnon, was allotted to Gad in Numbers 32, and seems to have been absorbed into <i>Naĥalat Reuven </i>in Joshua 13. By 840 Bce, though, the Moabites described the city as having a long history of belonging to Gad: Mesha was firmly entrenched in Dibon, indicating that the city had been Moabite for some time.",
            "In sum, the listing that ostensibly reflects the scenario during the Israelite conquest of the late Bronze period (thirteenth century BCE) has Gad’s territory skirting Reuben’s; some years later, the account of their <i>naĥalot</i> limits Gad to the northern belt of Reuben. Finally, the Moabite Stele, attesting to the reality of the ninth century BCE, returns to Gad the southern cities that were granted to them in Numbers 32 but were seemingly allocated to Reuben in Joshua 13. Can these accounts be reconciled?",
            "One approach is to treat these narrratives as reflective of various shifts in history. These two tribes were intimately linked in their <i>naĥalot</i>, and assignment of territory or dominance of cities may have fluctuated over time. Alternatively, and more likely, the account in Joshua that mentions Dibon and Aroer within the <i>naĥalah</i> of Reuben, and intimates that Ataroth and  Atrothshophan were also in Reuben’s <i>naĥalah</i>, is imprecise regarding the administration of these cities. While Reuben’s <i>naĥalah </i>might have broadly been described as the stretch from the Heshbon River (Wadi Hisban) to the Arnon, and while Gad’s portion was depicted as the stretch from the Jabbok to the Heshbon River, as per Joshua 13, these descriptions make no reference to those four southern cities as being Gadite. Perhaps this is because they were located in Reuben’s <i>naĥalah</i>. Gad, as the larger and more preeminent of the two tribes, needed more cities. From the outset, the Gadites built in Reuben’s southern belt and served not as a threat to the Reubenites, but as a buffer against the Moabites. The reference in the Mesha Stele to Gad’s long history in Ataroth is a solid indicator that the competing biblical texts should be reconciled as presenting complementary perceptions: Numbers is particular and city-oriented; Joshua is more general and region-oriented."

This zealousness tied him together with his brother Levi, and their combined intensity was potentially incendiary. Thus, even as Jacob grouped the brothers together, he also intimated that they separate for their own good. Indeed, the tribe of Levi later distanced themselves from that of Simeon, using their zealousness for the honor of God – and against Simeon. Levi, as embodied by the archetypal son Phineas, put their outstanding character trait of <i>kana’ut</i> to good purpose, even as Simeon’s <i>kana’ut</i> degenerated to competitiveness and jealousy. Moses omitted Simeon from his blessings, and we are forced to seek out a smidgen of absolution or favor for the beleaguered tribe embedded within another brother’s blessing. It seems this tribe could only have been redeemed by being “scattered among Israel.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It would seem that some Simeonites made their way up north, settling within the <i>naĥalot </i>of Ephraim and Manasseh (II Chronicles 34:6).

            "Simeon and Levi, the twinned brothers, came to embody two sides of a single, dangerous trait. <i>Kana’ut</i> can be expressed either as selfless zealotry for a lofty purpose, as achieved by Levi, or, conversely, jealousy driven by petty and personal reasons, with which Simeon was associated. Even as they diverged, Simeon and Levi remained interlinked, each defining the other: it was only through Simeon’s mistakes that Levi could learn to embody and express the positive aspects of zealotry.

Explicit in both contexts was that David assumed control of Ziklag – before he was coronated in Hebron – and of Simeon’s other cities, perhaps after he took the throne.

The two disputed which of them had dug the local well. Abimelech capitulated, admitting that it indeed had been Abraham. In making a pact for peace, both men swore over seven sheep on that day, so the area surrounding the well was renamed Be’er Sheva (Beer-sheba) – “The Well of the Seven” or “The Well of the Oath.” Abraham planted an <i>eshel </i>tree near the well and settled there to raise Isaac.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 21:22–34.</i>",

It is 70 meters (approx. 230 feet) deep, a massive undertaking to access the groundwater from this relatively high position. Since the site could have housed relatively few residents (given its small size), archaeologists posited that this well mainly catered to the needs of the surrounding nomadic tribes. This is particularly interesting, given that the site sits on the plain just north of the confluence of two large streambeds, Beer-sheba and Hebron, both of which served as main passageways for caravans and foot traffic in the region.

The dressed stones of the altar were discovered in secondary use in a storeroom wall, indicating that the altar was purposefully dismantled and reused in a mundane context. Hezekiah’s reforms, though, were not enough to save the city from the campaign of the Assyrian monarch Sennacherib, who sacked Beer-sheba in 701 BCE.

The midrash then takes another tack in praise of Levi: there were other tribes (Judah, Dan) where, when being granted their names, the identical formula, “therefore,” was applied. This special wording indicated an exceptionally large tribal population. That Levi was a tiny population compared to the other tribes was due to the fact that many of the tribe died in the service of carrying the <i>Aron Ha-Kodesh </i>(the Ark of the Tabernacle), a task that often resulted in death.

A zealous character, in contrast, glories in the uniqueness and greatness of the other. He cherishes not only his own integrity, but also the integrity of the whole that is formed by the utter individualism of its parts.

In the second century Bce, the Syrian Greeks threatened the traditional way of life in Judah by hellenizing the Temple compound and levying a series of draconian decrees on the native Jews. Specifically, they outlawed basic Mosaic practices, such as Shabbat and the dietary laws. The grassroots Jewish revolt was launched by the Hasmonean priest Mattathias and his sons from their hometown of Modi’in.

She had already named three sons in succession, each one explicitly marking her relationship with Jacob. “Now my husband will love me,” “God has heard that I am hated,” “Now my husband will be attached to me.” Yet here, with the birth of her fourth son, something changed: “This time, I can thank God. So she called him Judah [lit. thanksgiving, acknowledgment]” (Genesis 29:35). Angst disappeared. Leah offered only thanksgiving for this unexpected gift.",

Judah marked a turning point for Leah; she was transformed from a cripplingly uncertain wife to the confident matriarch. Having borne a family while her sister remained barren, Leah felt that an imbalance had been righted.",

In contrast to Reuben, he avoided over-­involvement in his parents’ affairs. This was not because he was unaware or distant; he simply exhibited more constraint and thoughtfulness when faced with a difficult situation.

Tamar, duty-bound to levirate marriage, at last set out to trick her father-in-law into performing the act.

He was an infamously paranoid megalomaniac, killing off family members and others whom he felt threatened his throne. Herod was responsible for numerous monumental building projects, among them Caesarea, Masada, and the splendid Temple in Jerusalem.</i> Herod nearly despaired at this location when he was being pursued by the Parthians in 37 Bce. He persevered, though, and later chose this spot to erect a startling conical monument to personal triumph that he named after himself. It was here that he entertained Marcus Auerelius from his frescoed theatre built into a massive artificial mountain. He willed the dry and tepid landscape to yield bathing pools, cavernous water cisterns, gardens, and massive towers. Everything was in the round – towers, walls, collonades – evincing his marvelous aesthetic and powerful pocketbook, since this design was a particularly expensive undertaking. It was in Herodium that he chose to be buried.",
            "Herodium tells some marvelous stories: of Herod, certainly, but also of the zealous Jews who escaped to here during the Roman siege on Jerusalem in 68 CE and unceremoniously mauled the fortress’s colonnade and triclinium.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A colonnade is a decorative series of columns, and a triclinium is a formal dining area. Both are standard Roman architectural features.</i> They hewed <i>mikvaot</i> into the manicured Roman lawns and repurposed the dining area of the palace for a synagogue. These stragglers held out for a little while, until the Romans, finished with Jerusalem, turned to battle the renegade Jews here and in Masada. Fifty years later, the guerilla soldiers of Bar Kokhba tunneled dozens of subterranean channels in Herodium, skillfully dodging the menacing Roman Tenth Legion for a few years, before they too were defeated.",

He noted that famous Judean towns, such as Bethlehem and Herodium, offered up “two faces”: a face to the mountain and a face to the wilderness (<i>panim la-har u-panim la-midbar</i>). These towns were situated on the eastern end of the Judean hills. Facing west are the terraced mountains described above. Facing east is the Judean Desert, with its craggy and desolate terrain.

Two biblical verses directly reference דבר in the sense of “pasture” (Micah 2:12 and Isaiah 5:17).</i> Mageni suggested that in the family of Yishai from Bethlehem, the older sons were farmers, while the younger son (David) shepherded the flock, since the land suited both occupations.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">חיים מגני, <i>חיים ביהודה</i> (שלמי אריאל, תשס״ד), 50.</i>",

To your left is Socoh, described in the Bible as the assembly point of the Philistines as they arrayed against Saul’s Israelite army: “The Philistines assembled their forces for battle; they massed at Socoh of Judah.…The Philistines were stationed on one hill and Israel was stationed on the opposite hill; the valley was between them” (I Samuel 17:1–3).",

One gate faced west, directly toward the Philistine city of Gath, Goliath’s home, around six miles due west of Khirbet Qeiyafa, and the other faced east toward Socoh and Hebron. This unusual phenomenon (two gates in a city wall is unheard of in this region, even among much larger cities like Lachish and Jerusalem) led archaeologists to suggest that the city be identified as the biblical Shaaraim (“Two Gates”).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 17:52.</i>",
            "The excavations at Qeiyafa have had a huge impact on what has been the prevailing battle within biblical archaeology circles for the past generation: whether the early monarchial period in Judea was a major, nation-­building era or rather a time when relatively minor chieftains (namely, David and Solomon) ruled over unfortified villages. Until now, the lack of archaeological evidence decidedly supported the latter theory; to wit, in the period of the early monarchy (eleventh century Bce), the excavated sites in Judea (Lachish, Arad, Beer-sheba, among others) were unfortified, small agricultural villages, and not the massive cities one might expect in David’s kingdom. The Qeiyafa excavation turned this lack of evidence on its head. The site is now definitively dated to 1000–970 Bce, based on carbon-dating analysis of burnt olive pits from the destruction level of the city, as well as pottery analysis. In other words, the site is now definitively dated to the time of King David’s reign – and it is the first place in the region that strongly attests to the urbanity and establishment of the Davidic kingdom. It took significant manpower and wealth to construct the impressive fortifications found in Khirbet Qeiyafa. The excavators of the site are assured in their determination that Qeiyafa was a well-planned fortified city, and not a rural settlement. Thus, Qeiyafa presents a strong argument for traditionalists who posit that King David was not a tribal chieftain, but rather an important king of substantial means who indeed fortified the southern areas of his kingdom.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In a related landmark find in 1993 in Tel Dan, excavators identified an inscription reading “House of David” as dating to the ninth century Bce, attesting for the first time to the objective truth of the Davidic dynasty.</i>",
            "The first few weeks of excavation yielded the most important – and remarkable – discovery at the site. The archaeological team uncovered an inscribed ostracon (a pottery sherd that was used in the ancient world in lieu of paper) with Hebrew words written in proto-Canaanite script (an alphabet that predates even the ancient <i>ketav Ivri</i>, the Phoenician-like script in which Hebrew was written throughout the Iron Period). This may be the oldest Hebrew inscription ever discovered! Some of the words that the epigraphers could decipher at first glance were <i>melekh</i> (king), <i>shofet</i> (judge), and <i>eved</i> (servant).",
            "A visit to Khirbet Qeiyafa catapults one back to the very stirrings of the Davidic dynasty, to a site that may very well have been built and fortified by a centralized Israelite administration in Judea, and later occupied by King David and his troops. It likely was witness to the Philistine/Israelite showdown in the Elah Valley that thrust David into the national limelight. The strongly built city would have served as an Israelite fortification against the Philistine coastal plain, with Philistine Gath menacing just a bit to the west.",

            "Lachish does not generally figure on the typical tourist itinerary, due mostly to its rather remote location and erroneously assigned inconsequence. Lachish was mentioned twenty-two times in <i>Tanakh</i>. It was a large and important city in Judea, paralleled by huge Hazor in the north and eclipsed in prominence only by Jerusalem (in fact a much smaller city than Lachish). Many foreign kings saw Lachish as a city that must be conquered in their quests to vanquish the region. Thus, Lachish was witness to many crucial battles in the history of Israel, battles that were described both in <i>Tanakh</i> and in the annals of the ancient world’s foreign empires.",
            "Let’s start with the tel. A tel is a mound, unique to the Middle East, formed by layers of occupation over thousands of years. As one society built its city on the ruins of a previous period, the site rose and the original landscape was permanently altered. Layer upon layer of civilization caused quite a build-up. After all, there was no reason to break new ground when building a new city when the original infrastructure and building materials were already abundant at a site that was obviously strategically important enough for previous periods to occupy! Such was the landscape at Lachish – you cannot miss this tel rising above the surrounding low hills of the <i>shefelah</i> (the Judean foothills).",
            "Originally a Canaanite city, Lachish was conquered by Joshua (Joshua 10:31–32). If we place the period of the conquest of the Land of Israel by Joshua and the Israelites in the Iron I period (1250–1000 Bce), as most scholars do, then we have evidence of Joshua’s conquest of Lachish on site. The remains of a burnt Iron I Canaanite temple complex, on the acropolis of the tel, were uncovered.

Over the years of Israelite presence in Lachish, during the reigns of such illustrious kings as David, Solomon, and their descendants, Lachish grew to become a massive, significant administrative center, heavily fortified by a six-meter-thick wall (approx. twenty feet thick) with the most impressive gate system as yet excavated in Israel.",
            "A number of years after Shalmaneser and Sargon, kings of Assyria, exiled the Northern Kingdom of Israel, their successor, Sennacherib, set his sights on <i>Malkhut Yehudah</i>, the Southern Kingdom, ruled by the righteous Hezekiah:",

            "A visitor to Lachish can easily make out the impressive Assyrian siege ramp (100 meters/328 feet long!) constructed by Sennacherib to penetrate the city. The Israelites inside Lachish tried to defend the city by erecting an interior counter-ramp, thereby raising the height of the city wall and forcing the Assyrians to likewise raise the height of their ramp to overcome the new defenses. The defensive measures, however, were to no avail. The Assyrians fought viciously and relentlessly, leaving behind masses of weapons, scales of armor, and hundreds of slingshots and arrowheads on the ramp and inside the city wall for archaeologists to discover thousands of years later. Add the macabre discovery of 1,500 piled skulls in a nearby cave, and the evidence decidedly points to a massive defeat of the Israelites at Lachish.",

These reliefs depicted the siege of Lachish and its defeat, complete with the ramp, ammunition, and major weaponry used against the city. Depictions of Israelites being cruelly killed and led off into captivity wearing chains were in every frame. Sennacherib made sure to include an image of the complex gate system, the remains of which are on the tel, as a specific point of pride in conquering the well-fortified Judean city. The Lachish siege reliefs are on permanent exhibit at the British Museum, along with other remains of Assyrian Nineveh.",

            "One last marvelous find at Lachish is worthy of note. The destroyed city was rebuilt, albeit on a smaller scale, by King Josiah, great-grandson of Hezekiah, sometime between 639 and 609 Bce. A short while after that, Lachish was again targeted by a mortal enemy: this time, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylonia, as he waged his destructive campaign against Judah and her final king, Zedekiah, on the eve of the Destruction of the First Temple, in 586 Bce. A cache of eighteen ostraca (inscribed pottery sherds) were found at Lachish. These letters preserved the last moments of the Jewish fighters’ stance against the Babylonians.

The message was immortalized on one of the ostraca discovered: “Let my lord know that we are watching over the beacon of Lachish, according to the signals which my lord gave, for Azekah is not seen.” This letter, in light of the verse in Jeremiah that spoke of Azekah and Lachish as the only two cities left before Nebuchadnezzar’s war machine reached Jerusalem, is especially poignant. Neighboring Azekah had fallen; we know that Lachish was next to go.",

The midrash did not much care about how the wives of Jacob knew what God had intended for their husband’s house; it is asking us to examine the fundamental shift in Leah’s thinking, and to explain her newfound confidence from the birth of Judah onwards.",
            "Yet despite the entrance of Bilhah and Zilpah as surrogates, both Rachel and Leah continued to long for children of their own – even though four children had already been born to Leah.

Leah was then willing to forget and forego any hope that her love for Jacob would be requited. She was practical, ambitious, building an enduring bond throughout the years and the children borne, to which Jacob, at this juncture, conceded. He went with Leah, and did not put up a fight.",

He reminded us that the Persian king sought advice as to how to best resolve the crisis of power distribution that was thrust into sharp focus after Queen Vashti refused his order to put in a public appearance. At the core of the problem was the question of the relationship between the sexes, especially the husband-wife relationship.",
            "That Ahasuerus approached the Wise Men of Issachar for advice is very instructive, posited Rabbi Mael, given the particulars at stake. For Issachar embodied the trait of <i>binah </i>(recall, <i>yod’ei vinah la-itim</i>) – the specific category of wisdom defined as taking a germ of an idea and analyzing it until it is best understood – of <i>building</i> the idea from its original kernel of inspiration. Issachar was born at the apex of Leah’s <i>binah</i>. She had worked diligently at building a partnership with Jacob through the years by bearing him children. She had nurtured and developed the rhythms of their relationship until it reached the point of complete maturity and mutual understanding – “Come to me! And he lay with her that night” – that resulted in the conception of Issachar. The <i>binah</i> necessary to navigate the particulars of the husband-wife relationship is the same <i>binah</i> that is applied to figuring out the rhythms of the natural world. Understanding the nature of things – the sun and the moon, man and woman – and then intercalating and applying that knowledge: this is <i>binah</i>. In this area, Issachar, the product of Leah’s emergent <i>binah</i>, excelled naturally.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The tribal flag was emblazoned with the symbols of the sun and moon (BaR 2:7), intimating perhaps both Issachar’s prowess at intercalation as well as his astuteness regarding human relationships.</i>",
            "Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch further refined the concept of Issachar’s unique wisdom in his commentary on Genesis 49:15:",
            "<small>They [the representatives of Issachar who rallied to David]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Chronicles 12:24.</i> were “<i>yod’ei vinah la-itim</i>” – they brought with them <i>binah</i>, discernment, the ability to see between things [<i>re’iyat beinayim</i>], to recognize the interrelationships of persons and things and their potential effects on one another. This insight, attained by Issachar during his hours of leisure, was <i>da’at binah</i>, concrete perception, not sophistry but practical understanding of the true relationships of persons and things, which is acquired through genuine <i>hokhmat ha-Torah</i>. And it was <i>la-itim</i>; it came through correct evaluation of the uniqueness of any given moment.</small>",
            "The Talmud informed us that the Sages of Issachar refused to proffer advice to Ahasuerus, fearing the king’s wrath at either outcome.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Megillah</i> 12b.</i> On a deeper level, though, they fully grasped this particular circumstance (<i>yod’ei vinah la-itim</i>). They feared (and were hesitant to confront) the fundamental impropriety of the Ahasuerus-Vashti partnership – that two “suns” could not share one sky, as found in the rabbinic literature: “What accounts for Ahasuerus’s excessive anger [at Vashti]? Rava said: It was because she had sent him a message, saying ‘You’re just my father’s stable boy!’” (<i>Megillah</i> 12b). And:",

            "The understanding that was the purview of Issachar, masters of <i>binah</i>, was manifest in profound ways. It is the understanding that relationships sour if each party always seeks to outshine the other, if husband or wife fails to grasp the delicate balance that must be maintained for two people to live together peacefully; that in order for this particular personality, the blazing Ahasuerus, to find happiness, he had to partner with a woman who resembled the unassuming moon in her modesty and unpretentiousness. The Sages explain: “If her name was Hadassah, why then was she called Esther? Because the nations of the world used to say admiringly that she was as beautiful as <i>Istahar</i> – the moon” (<i>Megillah</i> 13a). The Sages of Issachar therefore wisely keep silent, allowing for Ahasuerus to realize on his own that Esther was his perfect complement.",

Whereas Zebulun ventured out to foreign lands for trade with Gentiles and to impress positively that way, Issacharites stayed by their brother tribe’s shores, plying their produce to passing foreign ships and dazzling the foreign seafarers with their navigation prowess.",

The Seforno interpreted the enigmatic verse of the donkey “crouching among the sheepfolds” (plural) as intimating that Issachar paced regularly under the weight of a double burden, a task that only a strong <i>ĥamor</i> was capable of handling. This double burden of Issachar was <i>Torah im derekh eretz</i>; that is, the application of wisdom to political and practical matters. Entirely insufficient was his study of Torah if it were not made relevant and accessible to the rest of the nation. Other commentators took the same tack, as Rashi comments on Genesis 49:14: “<i>Rovetz</i> – this means wandering, since Issachar traveled around deciding on matters of halakhah for the nation,” and Radak on Genesis 49:15: “<i>Le-mas oved</i> – Issachar was the servant of Israel, involved in disseminating wisdom and Torah matters.”",

For leisure enables a person to stand tall and to find himself.…Knowledge of Torah and its practical application to current circumstances are not attained by one who immerses himself in business. Rather, they are attained by one who, in his hours of leisure, frees his mind of all else, of whom it can be said that “<i>Va-yar menuĥah ki tov</i>,” he regards leisure as the true profit to be obtained from work; thus “<i>oseh Torato keva u-melakhto ar’ai</i>” – he regards Torah study as the main goal, and work as merely an incidental means. Issachar regards <i>ha-aretz</i>, agriculture, as the surest path to this goal. Hence, he devoted himself with enthusiasm to the taxing chores of tilling the soil: “<i>va-yehi le-mas oved</i>.”</small>",
            "Issachar succeeded at his tasks, both tilling the land and toiling in the <i>beit midrash</i>.

This is the site where Gideon’s soldiers gathered in preparation for war against the Midianites.

Curiously, Issachar was entirely absent from the story, though the battle was arrayed squarely in its <i>naĥalah</i>. This was most likely because Issachar had suffered the brunt of the previous seven years of Midianite incursions into Israel, and their land and numbers were severely damaged. In a sense, Issachar’s countrymen were coming to their aid (and their own), trying to drive the Midianites away, so that they all could rebuild.",
            "Gideon tested his soldiers at En-harod, seeking only those who were not serial idolators. He asked each soldier to drink from the spring. Those who prostrated themselves were sent home, as were others who were fearful of battle. Gideon was left with a mere three hundred soldiers to man his army. They successfully fought the Midianites, who had encamped just north, in the Kesuloth Valley between Mount Tabor and Moreh Hill<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For an entirely different theory about the Midianite encampment and the location of the battle, see אליצור, <i>מקום בפרשה</i>, 123–125.</i> (Moreh Hill was opposite En-harod, but the Midianite camp would not have been visible to the Israelites at En-harod; it was, though, close enough that Gideon could easily spy on them).

It’s worthwhile to pay a short visit to the atmospheric cemetery here, the final resting place for many of the young <i>ĥalutzim</i> who died in the 1920s–30s while draining swamps, building roads and fighting Arabs. As you wander around the tilted and moss-­covered tombstones, notice how disproportionate the losses were to their ranks at the time. Disease, accident, and suicide were rampant – these young ideologues could hardly tolerate the dissonance between their will to work and the near-­impossible conditions of daily life. At the entrance to the cemetery, there is a mass grave for all the infants who died at birth or shortly afterwards. These young parents – barely adults themselves – had no elders to guide them through their grief. The price of revitalizing <i>Naĥalat Yissakhar</i> in our modern period was steep indeed.",

Hosea first lambasted a sinning and traitorous Israel as “<i>Yizrael</i>,” destined to suffer the same cursed fate as this city and valley that had seen so much bloodshed. But then, as God remembered His love for His people and forgave them their iniquity, “<i>Yizrael</i>” came into its own as the “<i>Zera-El</i>,” the seed of God, a fertile tract, abundantly blessed.

Saadiya Gaon, Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Rashbam, <i>Bekhor Shor</i>.</i> to mean “dwelling place,” in which case the meaning of the second half of the verse is “now my husband will dwell with me.” In the simplest sense, Leah followed the agenda she established with her firstborn, and continued to use with every subsequent son: the children were a means to secure a relationship with Jacob. One commentator, though, read a more profound significance into the solid and secure connotation of <i>z-v-l</i>: with the birth of this son, Leah secured for herself the ultimate, eternal dwelling – a grave next to her husband in <i>Me’arat HaMakhpelah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Alshikh, Genesis 30:20.</i>",

He received no tangible benefit from the exchange, while Issachar saw a marked material advantage. Thus, in the blessings of both Jacob and Moses, Zebulun was extolled before the older Issachar.

The seas, Zebulun understood, belonged to no one – they could be harvested only by charisma and savvy. To be consigned to the water meant a life of constant danger, constant alertness. Yes, there was much to be gained, but also everything to be lost. Control over ports did not equal a regular cash flow. Zebulun was fully aware that his was a difficult destiny:",

            "God comforted Zebulun with an additional gift: “All of your brothers will need you for the <i>ĥilazon </i>[sea creature that produces the indigo dye]” (<i>Megillah</i> 6a). The indigo dye secreted by the <i>ĥilazon</i> was the source of the costly <i>tekhelet</i> color, necessary for certain priestly garments as well as for the <i>petil tekhelet</i>, the single blue thread that was tied with the other <i>tzitziot</i> on each corner of four-cornered garments. The straightforward intent of this midrash was that Zebulun would always be wealthy, no matter how fickle the seas, because he provided the prized <i>ĥilazon</i> snail to the rest of <i>Am Yisrael</i>. This snail was harvested from the northern shores of Israel, an area that fell under the purview of Zebulun’s <i>naĥalah</i>.",

He provided for others’ well-being – whether Jacob’s wealth, Leah’s security, or Issachar’s freedom. He was always involved in <i>pragmatiah</i>, always looking for the next hot deal, never sitting still. He was the ultimate worldly <i>shevet</i>, immersed in the here-and-now.

These white strands are the sum of our mundane lives, to be lived in holiness, shot through by an awareness of the unreachable Divine, symbolized by the single strand of <i>tekhelet</i>. Even though Zebulun was busy with matters of <i>pragmatiah</i>, to his lot fell the <i>tekhelet</i>, the symbol of the otherworldly. When Zebulun felt rootless and uncertain, God gently reminded him that his calling was in no way inferior to that of his brothers. They turned to you not only for your worldly acumen, God said, but also for the inspiration to exalt the mundane by infusing it with a higher purpose. It was not Jacob and Moses alone, God intimated, who took note of your overtures to Issachar. Do not be discouraged, Zebulun – to you alone, who compromised your personal safety, relinquished serenity, and toiled selflessly to help others realize <i>their</i> destinies – is dominion of the <i>tekhelet</i>, and to you alone are the material and spiritual blessings of the blue, mysterious seas.",

            "One final note on the matter: we have much to learn about Issachar’s appreciation for Zebulun from a famous example of such an arrangement – the relationship between Maimonides and his younger brother, David.

For about a year from the day the evil tidings reached me, I remained prostrate in bed with a severe inflammation, fever and mental confusion, and almost perished. From then until this day, that is, about eight years, I have been in a state of disconsolate mourning. How can I be consoled? For he was my son; he grew up upon my knees; he was my brother, my pupil.

David had realized his older brother’s scholarly potential, understood well his own strengths and business prowess, and committed to the classic <i>Yissakhar-Zevulun</i> arrangement. Let us carefully note two things: David himself apparently studied Torah under his brother’s tutelage, and Maimonides was a scholastic giant, whose promise and achievements benefited generations.

See <i>Yerushalmi</i>, <i>Sukkah</i> 5:1; PRE 33; BR 98:11. Also, Jonah’s hometown is given as Gath-hepher in II Kings 14:25, a city that was in <i>Naĥalat Zevulun </i>(Joshua 19:13); see YS 550.</i> Within this context, it seems entirely appropriate for Jonah of Zebulun to entreat his endangered fellow passengers to “raise me and cast me into the sea” – a son of Zebulun returning to his natural habitat.",
            "Jonah was connected to his tribe in other ways as well. Even though many others – Amos, Isaiah, Obadiah, Nahum, among others – prophesied about nations other than Israel, only Jonah was instructed by God to <i>travel abroad</i> and deliver His message directly to a foreign people: “Rise, and journey to Nineveh, that large city, and call out to her, for her iniquity has come before me” (Jonah 1:2).",
            "Zebulun was the tribe of ambassadors, the ones who interacted with the peoples of the world, who were comfortable in their cosmopolitanism. Even as Jonah fled his mission, he was still a child of his tribe, spreading a vision of God to his far-off destination.",
            "Jonah’s effect on non-Jews was demonstrated even through his escape route!

            "Though the seas might have carried Zebulun off to distant shores, and though their primary place was interacting with foreigners at busy ports, this tribe fully understood the need to stay rooted to the nation’s spiritual center. Jonah and his tribe quenched their thirst for the Divine with the <i>nisukh ha-mayim </i>ceremony, rejoicing with the nations of the world as they “ascend year after year to worship the King, Lord of Hosts, and to celebrate the festival of Sukkoth” (Zechariah 14:16).",

Consider the terrible situation of both sisters when Rachel eventually married Jacob, as encapsulated in this verse: “Jacob came also to Rachel, and he also loved Rachel more than Leah” (Genesis 29:30). Leah may have been pained by the knowledge that she was less beloved, but Rachel suffered with the reality of acting the auxiliary within her own life story.

A <i>me’asef</i> herded the stragglers and forgotten elements, encouraged them to remain in the fold, said to them, “I’m with you, brother, in your loneliness, and yet I’m still part of this nation and you should be, too.” The <i>me’asef </i>absorbed everything, and left no one behind. “Dan will be a serpent on the path” – perhaps not the gloried tribe, but the one who most easily related to those who dawdled on the fringes, not really a part of things.",

They maintained borders with a number of other tribes: Judah in the south, Ephraim in the north, and Benjamin in the north/northeast.",
            "Two impediments prevented them from settling permanently in their <i>naĥalah</i>. Firstly, the territory was simply not large enough to accommodate the huge tribal population. Though larger in population than the tribe of younger brother Naphtali, Dan’s <i>naĥalah </i>was a fraction of the size.

The verse describing Dan’s territory in Joshua 19:47, though, told ultimately of their unsettled lifestyle in this swath of central Israel: “But the territory of the Danites slipped from their grasp, so they migrated and made war on Leshem.”</i>",

Moses presciently blessed Dan that he be a “lion cub that leaps forth from the Bashan.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 33:22.</i> This perhaps indicated that Dan occupied portions of the Bashan, in the northern Golan.",

There they were grouped together as the cities conquered by Ben-Hadad of Damascus from Baasha, king of Israel, separately from the “land of Naphtali” which was in the same vicinity.

            "By now the reason for this is clear. Dan was not a team player, and the fiercely isolationist tribe always preferred to linger on the fringe of the nation. In which case, why was he not granted the more removed northern territory from the outset?",
            "Rabbi Eliyahu Mallai suggested that the confined contours of Dan’s original <i>naĥalah </i>were intended deliberately to counter his natural tendencies. It served this tribe best to be surrounded by buffering influences, like Judah (a natural partnership, as outlined above) and Jerusalem (the national capital), to balance its fierce strength and draw the distant tribe closer to its brethren.

We begin at the summit of Zorah (Tel Sor’a), reached through a serpentine drive up through the sculpture forest in Park Eshtaol. There are two marked tombs, most likely those of Arab sheikhs, but they serve our purposes as the graves of Samson and his father, Manoah (that is indeed how they are marked).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Israelite graves from this period (Iron I) were not located in town, but rather in one of the caves dotting the periphery.

            "The story began with a woman: the wife of Manoah the Danite. An angel appeared to her twice, somewhere close to where we are standing, and informed her that she would be given a son. The angel warned her: do not cut his hair, and do not allow him wine – nor should you drink any wine! He shall be a nazarite even in the womb.",
            "Gazing down toward the riverbed below, you will see what a tall order this was. Nahal Sorek is specked with abundant vines and groves. Boutique wineries abound in this region, which is famous for its quality grapes. To abstain from wine in <i>Naĥalat Dan</i> is like being a teetotaler in Alsace. And yet abstain Samson did, religiously, even as he grew up in the vineyard.",
            "Samson’s inner world was described poignantly: “The spirit of God began to ring within him in the Danite camp, between Zorah and Eshtaol” (Judges 13:25).",
            "What else for a son of Dan than to have the tumult of divine awareness beating in his breast? Consider that his tribe’s territory was a narrow confine sandwiched between two large and overwhelming presences, Ephraim and Judah. There was no large, wide expanse to Dan’s <i>naĥalah</i>. It was the place of restless souls, as if designed for pacing between the closely situated and densely populated villages. Anyone living there would have sought escape. Samson’s discontent led him to squabble with the neighboring Philistine villages, and to find relief again and again in the bosom of foreign women. Eventually, his fellow tribesmen quit the place altogether, seeking broader terrain up north – seeking the quietude of isolation.",
            "Therefore, north we head, to Tel Dan, the conquered city of Laish, renamed for the tribe.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Joshua 19, Laish was called Leshem – the same name used for Dan’s stone on the priestly breastplate. Intimations of Dan were present in Laish even in its earliest permutation.</i> What an attractive location this must have been for the ancients! Based at the foot of Mount Hermon, Laish was built around ample springs whose waters eventually flowed together into a strong river. An important road from the Galilee to Damascus passed this city in antiquity, enriching the place and heightening its importance. No wonder then that the men of Dan coveted Laish: “The land was very good…expansive…where there was no shortage of anything you could possibly want.… ” (Judges 18:9–10).",
            "Tel Dan is one of the most exciting archaeological sites in the country, with impressive remains from many critical periods. There is a magnificently intact Middle Bronze (eighteenth century Bce) mud brick gate, part of the rampart system of huge packed earthen embankments. This gate served an earlier incarnation of the Canaanite city of Laish, at least five hundred years before the Israelites began conquering the area. When Abraham set out to rescue his captive nephew, Lot, he reached this city and may very well have seen this massive fortification system in action.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The city is named Dan in Genesis 14:14.</i>",

            "Dan’s infamy was established by the secessionist king of Israel, Jeroboam son of Nebat, who carefully pried his people’s attention away from Jerusalem by building two alternative cultic sites, one in Beth-el, the other in Dan. The primary reason seemed political:",

If the people go to worship in the Temple of God in Jerusalem, their hearts will revert to their lord, to Rehoboam, king of Judah.…The king took counsel, and he made two golden calves; and he said, “You have been going up to Jerusalem long enough. These are your gods, O Israel, who delivered you from Egypt!” He placed one in Beth-el and the other in Dan.<br>I Kings 12:26–29</small>",
            "It is also possible that Jeroboam chose Dan because the city was already considered a sacred place in the region, the Danites having worshipped in their temple there for hundreds of years previously.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See above.</i>",
            "Have a look at the excavated temple complex. The upper platform, or <i>bamah</i>, was where Jeroboam’s golden calf was likely placed. Fragments of a large four-horned altar uncovered in the lower platform, as well as a sacrificial bowl containing animal bones, an incense installation, and spatulas found in the antechambers all conclusively establish that this building was a cultic center.",
            "This temple continued to function throughout the Israelite kingdom’s term, falling prey to destruction by the Assyrians only in 732 Bce, when Tiglath-Pileser ravaged the north. The words of the prophet Amos were realized: “On that day…those who swear by the idol of Samaria and say, ‘By the life of your god, Dan’…will fall and not rise again” (Amos 8:13–14).",
            "The reputation of Dan as a cultic center, though, did not go the way of the destroyed temple. Indeed, even as late as the Hellenistic period, Dan was associated with idolatrous worship. A dedicatory stone discovered in the temple and dating to the third–second centuries Bce bears the bilingual inscription (in Greek and Aramaic): “To the god of Dan, Zoilos made a vow.” That the material evidence colludes with the biblical and rabbinic record on the issue of Dan’s idolatry provides a classic opportunity to “live the Bible” by visiting the site.",
            "Perhaps the most exciting discovery at Tel Dan was found in the Israelite city’s fortifications, renovated in the ninth century BCE. Fragments of an Aramaic inscription commissioned by Hazael, king of Damascus, who ruled Dan for a brief period in the ninth century Bce, were recovered. Once pieced together, the text relays Hazael’s victory over the kings of Israel and Judah on the battlefield.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The biblical parallel to these events is recounted in II Kings 9.

            "<b>Naĥalat Naphtali</b><br>The <i>naĥalah </i>of Naphtali soared over a vast terrain, broad and expansive. It covered a good bulk of the north, stretching west from the southern tip of the Sea of Chinnereth over to its meeting point with Zebulun and Issachar at Mount Tabor, and then north to encompass the entire central and eastern Galilee, including the Hula Valley and the rivers that feed the Jordan. Naphtali shared a western border with both Zebulun and Asher. Theirs was the largest northern <i>naĥalah</i>. The emblem of the northern command of the Israel Defense Forces is, naturally, a deer, since most of contemporary northern Israel belonged to Naphtali.",
            "The <i>ayal</i>, with his long, windy antlers, is an animal particularly suited to navigating the natural brush and foliage that covers much of the northern stretches of <i>Naĥalat Naphtali</i>. The image of these twisted antlers perfectly suits Naphtali, the “connecting” tribe devoted to weaving the intricate binds that tie our diverse nation together.",
            "In contrast to Dan, who felt constrained within their <i>naĥalah</i>, Naphtali was granted a broad expanse of land. This <i>naĥalah </i>reflected the expansiveness and openness of Naphtali’s personality, one that could effectively mediate between others because he wished only to satisfy all parties. As a binder, he had more room, not less; he was not limited to a single point.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Dan, on the other hand, felt that they needed to fight in order to expand outward.</i> Often, in our times, Israelis travel north to recharge their batteries, soaking in the spaciousness of <i>Naĥalat Naphtali</i> and enjoying the large expanse between villages. Anecdotally, a noted benefit of living up north is that there is a more generous, open spirit among local residents than is found in the more congested and busy center of the country.",

            "We begin our tour at the imposing Tel Ĥazor, a massive ancient site by regional standards. This important city in Naphtali was originally Canaanite, reaching its apex in the Middle Bronze period (c. 1750 Bce) and then again as an Israelite city in the first half of Iron II (1000–720 Bce). Hazor cropped up in numerous ancient records, including the nineteenth century BCE Egyptian execration texts and the fourteenth century Bce el-Amarna correspondence between Canaanite kings and the Egyptian pharaoh. More detail about the city and its wealth is provided by the Mari archives, a huge collection of cuneiform texts dating to the eighteenth century Bce, discovered in the ancient Sumerian (later Hittite) city of Mari, in eastern Syria.",
            "Enter the site and walk toward the tented lookout on the right. You’ll  now see a trench that cuts through the many strata to reveal all the layers of the site, affording you a glimpse at the massive lower city, excavated by Yigael Yadin in the 1950s. Yadin exposed temples, basalt pillars and gates, and many other architectural curiosities and relics from Canaanite Hazor. The massive earthen ramparts circling the city made the conquest of Hazor a formidable challenge.",
            "It was this Canaanite city that organized the northern cities to wage a campaign challenging Joshua, after Israel had defeated an alliance of southern Canaanite fiefdoms. King Jabin, a name of numerous sovereigns associated with Hazor throughout its history, organized the northern rulers against the Israelites:",
            "<small>When Jabin king of Hazor heard [of Joshua’s victory against the southern Amorite kings], he sent to Jobab, king of Madon, to the king of Shimron, to the king of Achshaph, to the kings from the north, in the mountain, in the plain south of Chinnereth, in the lowland.…All these kings gathered; they came and encamped together at the Waters of Merom to wage war with Israel.<br>Joshua 11:1–5</small>",
            "The excavations at Hazor have thus far uncovered seventeen cuneiform tablets, all written in Akkadian, tantalizing scholars with the prospect of a much larger cache waiting to be discovered. On one of these tablets is written the personal name, Ibni perhaps referring to the king of Hazor, whose name was given as Ibni-Addu (meaning “Hadad [Canaanite weather god] shall build”) in the Mari tablets. Ibni must have been one and the same as Jabin, king of Hazor from the Bible!",
            "Make your way to the large, covered area on the acropolis of the tel. Here was the impressive Canaanite palace of Jabin. Successive temples or palaces were built on this, the highest point in the city, but it was Joshua’s Jabin who ruled from the remains of the palace you see before you.",
            "In the preserved flagstone forecourt is a large white <i>bamah</i>, or cultic platform, set in front of two massive basalt pillar bases flanking the entrance to the throne room. Excavations yielded conclusive evidence of a massive conflagration that destroyed this palace, along with all of the other buildings from the thirteenth century BCE. Deliberate iconoclasm was also on the archaeological record in connection with this event, which followed the defeat of the northern Caananite alliance to Israel:",
            "<small>Joshua turned back at that time and conquered Hazor and struck its king with the sword, because Hazor had formerly been the leader of all those kingdoms. They killed every soul that was in it…he burned Hazor in fire.<br>Joshua 11:10–11</small>",
            "The dressed basalt orthostats of the throne room, still in situ, were topped with wooden beams before the mudbricks were laid, to protect the structure from earthquake damage, so the storied palace fell easily to fire, as the beams burned down. The mighty heat, helped along by wooden floors and large pithoi of oil in the building, cracked the dressed basalt and partially melted and reddened the mudbricks. Massive piles of soot discovered upon excavation and the still-charred walls complete the picture.",
            "Turn back a bit to take in the famed Solomonic Gates, discovered by Yadin on a lucky hunch. He reasoned that since a uniquely structured six-roomed city gate was discovered in Megiddo, and since the architectural plans drawn up some fifty years before Gezer’s first excavations also hinted to an identical gate there, he was bound to find the third in the series here. He did, and dated it to Solomon. After all, the <i>Tanakh</i> refers to “a description of the levy imposed by Solomon to build the Temple of God, his own palace, the Milo, and the walls of Jerusalem, Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer” (I Kings 9:15). Since Hazor was grouped with Megiddo and Gezer in this verse as having been renovated during the same period, it stands to reason that the major architectural features, especially fortifications, would be uniform throughout.",
            "Fortunate Yadin. In his first season at Hazor, he uncovered the six-chamber gate before you, identical to the one found in Megiddo. These two powerful northern cities, with Gezer in central Israel, were the focus of Solomon’s attention, as he embarked on his various countrywide building projects. And the residents of this city were from the tribe of Naphtali.",
            "Visit the impressive water system built during the reign of the Israelite king Ahab in the ninth century Bce, which also parallels the renovations visited by that king on Megiddo. Ahab understood the importance of easy access to a city’s water supply during times of enemy siege. And the large Israelite four-room house and pillared storage facility, originally located on top of the destroyed Caananite palace, but meticulously moved to its present spot, illustrates further the material life of the Naphtali tribesmen of Hazor.",
            "Our last stop in Hazor brings us to the era of the Judges, a relatively ambiguous period in the history of settlement in this city. According to the biblical record, there was yet another Jabin, king of the Canaanites, who ruled from Hazor. This other Jabin dominated the Israelites for twenty years until Deborah, their judge and leader, called on the military man Barak son of Abinoam to organize against him.",
            "At the westernmost excavated area (Area #6), a cultic high place was uncovered; the basalt obelisk marks the temple center. It is inconclusive who exactly worshipped here, considering that the city was totally burned a few generations earlier and was only significantly rebuilt during the reign of Solomon. Did Jabin (not to be confused with the earlier Jabin who battled Joshua’s army) have a reduced hamlet here, an inherited headquarters from which he commanded the northern Canaanite clans alongside Sisera, who based himself much farther west in Harosheth-hagoiim?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is likely that the single reference to Hazor in Joshua 4 was an accessory to the name Jabin, and that the four times that Jabin was named as “Jabin, king of Canaan” was of much more significance in determining that king’s domain during the period between Joshua and the monarchy. To conclude that this cultic installation was used by the Naphtali tribesmen during the period of the Judges is indeterminate, for we cannot rule out the possibility that the Canaanites reinhabited Hazor after its destruction in the thirteenth century BCE. For more on Harosheth-hagoiim, see “Visiting <i>Naĥalat Menasheh</i>” in chapter 13.</i>",
            "The cultic installation was eventually replaced with an Israelite fortress, most likely during the renovations dated to Ahab’s reign (concurrent with the advanced water system). Ascend the Israelite tower, the last structure to be added to the fortress in the eighth century Bce, from which the soldiers of Naphtali surely saw the Assyrian forces of Tiglath-Pileser advancing. It was the northernmost cities of Naphtali that fell to Assyria in their first wave of conquest in 732 Bce,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Kings 15:29.</i> followed a decade later by the complete exile of <i>Malkhut Yisrael </i>(the Northern Kingdom).",
            "Pay a visit to a neighboring kibbutz serendipitously named Ayelet HaShahar – the Sages’ designation of Esther. This was the first kibbutz in the northern Galilee, founded in 1915. Its name suggests both <i>Naĥalat Naphtali</i> and the dawning of redemption, perfectly capturing the early pioneers’ ideology of resettling the biblical landscape to bring about national renewal.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Historian Ze’ev Vilnai writes: “The place’s Arabic name is <i>Najmat a-Tzovakh</i>, meaning ‘morning star,’ thus the name Ayelet HaShahar was given. The morning star, <i>ayelet ha-shaĥar</i>, symbolizes the rebirth of Israel in her land” (translation mine). From <i>אגדות ארץ ישראל </i>(ירושלים: קרית ספר, תשמ״א), 267.<br>Further symbolism to the name Ayelet HaShahar, which decidedly also pertains to the establishment of the modern-day <i>yishuv</i> that bears its name, is found in <i>Yerushalmi, Berakhot</i> 1, with a parallel in <i>Yerushalmi, Yoma</i> 3:<br>מסופר על רבי חייא רבא ורבי שמעון בן חלפתא שהיו מהלכים בבקעת ארבל וראו לפניהם את איילת השחר אשר אורה עלה ובקע בחשכת הליל. אמר רבי חייא רבא לחברו: “כך היא גאולתן של ישראל: בתחילה קמעא קמעא, כל מה שהיא [הגאולה] הולכת, היא רבה והולכת.<br>R. Ĥiya Rabbah and R. Simeon ben Ĥalafta were traveling in the plain of Arbel when they saw the <i>ayelet ha-shaĥar</i>, the morning star, rise and pierce through the night’s darkness. R. Ĥiya said to his colleague: So shall be the redemption of Israel. In the beginning it shall be incremental. As it starts going, though, it will gain strength and speed!</i> Ayelet HaShahar has a small museum that houses some of the artifacts discovered over the years of excavation at Hazor.",
            "We move further north to another large tel in <i>Naĥalat Naphtali</i>, the only tel in the mountainous region of the upper eastern Galilee. This is Tel Qedesh (Kedesh), one of the six cities designated an <i>ir miklat</i>, or city of refuge for one guilty of accidental manslaughter.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 20:17.</i> These six cities were scattered on both sides of the Jordan. It was a residential center of Levites as well as Naphtalites, since the cities of refuge were allotted to the tribe of Levi throughout the Land of Israel.",
            "Excavations thus far at Tel Qedesh have focused on the Persian, Hellenistic, and Roman periods at the tel. Ancient Kedesh, originally an Early Bronze Canaanite city, still lies buried under these later layers of civilization. Traces of a large earthen glacis circling the tel date to the Canaanite Kedesh and indicate the large size and imposing defenses of the city. Judging by its proportions, it competed with Hazor in the monarchial period for top significance in <i>Naĥalat Naphtali</i>, although only a future archaeological excavation can provide more conclusive evidence.",
            "Kedesh surfaces in a famous biblical episode in the period of the Judges.",
            "Barak son of Abinoam, called to action by Deborah, hailed from Kedesh-naphtali. There is yet another Kedesh (identified as Ĥorvat Qedesh) in the southern region of <i>Naĥalat Naphtali</i>, to the east of Jabneel and in the general area of Mount Tabor. Most scholars suggest that this second Kedesh was more likely the city where Deborah and Barak mustered an army from Naphtali and Zebulun.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The city of Kedesh was listed between Megiddo and Jokneam in Joshua 12, further evidence that there was a Kedesh in the southern region of <i>Naĥalat Naphtali</i>.</i> Since the battle took place in the vicinity of Mount Tabor and the Kishon River, and Sisera fled to an area near Kedesh where he met a gruesome death at the hands of the heroine Yael, it is unlikely that Tel Qedesh in the far north was involved in the biblical story.",
            "What there is to see of Tel Qedesh thus far is confined to the northeastern section, accessible via the parking lot. Take a short stroll through the remains of ornately decorated Roman-era sarcophagi. One originally had the image of Nike, the winged goddess of victory (later iconoclasts have left contemporary visitors with only the wings from the goddess’s form to admire). Farther down the path was a most impressive Roman temple, dedicated to the sun god Helios. Much of the eastern entrance is still standing, complete with doorways, carved niches, and some stunning examples of carved stone lintels, pillar bases, and cornices (much of the stone lies scattered on the ground, felled by a fourth-century earthquake).",
            "One final observation as you travel through Naphtali, especially in the northernmost stretches: the Torah scholarship in this <i>naĥalah </i>must be noted. Just around every corner you will encounter a tomb of one of the Tannaitic or Amoraic Sages. Most of their prodigious scholarly activity, redacted into the corpus of rabbinic literature that formed the bulk of the Oral Law, took place in the villages of the Galilee. Then the lands of Naphtali fostered another period of immense Torah scholarship hundreds of years later, during the kabbalistic renaissance of sixteenth-century Safed."

            "Leah was a woman who understood well that each child she bore for her husband cemented his hard-won love. (Reuben: “Behold! A son! Now my husband will love me!” Simeon: “The Lord has heard that I am unloved and has given me this one also.” Levi: “This time my husband will become attached to me, for I have borne him three sons.”) Yet after the birth of her fourth son, Judah, her streak seemingly ran its course: <i>va-ta’amod mi-ledet</i> – “and she ceased giving birth” (Genesis 29:35). This affected her keenly. The text mentioned it twice, driving home the significance of Leah’s secondary infertility.",
            "Meanwhile, Rachel initiated a desperate strategy learned from Sarah, wife of Abraham: if you can’t do it yourself, find a suitable replacement. Barren Rachel built her family through an ancient arrangement of surrogacy. She gave her maidservant, Bilhah, to Jacob to bear the children who in name and upbringing were hers: Dan and Naphtali. “She shall birth through my knees [in my stead], and I, too, shall be built through her.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 30:3.</i>",
            "Leah immediately followed suit. After being told that Rachel gave her maidservant Bilhah to Jacob, the next verse informs us that Leah gave <i>her</i> maidservant Zilpah to Jacob as well. “When Leah saw that she had stopped bearing, she took her maid Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as concubine” (Genesis 30:9).",
            "In contrast to Rachel, Leah provided no reason for giving Zilpah to Jacob as a wife. A complex mix of jealousy and vision lay behind this apparently inexplicable action. Latent was the competition with the sister who then had claim to both children with Jacob, as well as his unaffected love. Beyond that, though, lay a more reasoned method: a determined sense that she should be mothering most of Jacob’s children.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">BR 71:4.</i> Leah saw herself as the primary mother, the one whose position in the family was based on her bearing Jacob the bulk of his children. She therefore gave Zilpah to Jacob, and alongside the four that she already bore were the two children emerging from this new union. All were named by her, and all she considered her own.",
            "This was the complex context into which Gad emerged: a son of Leah’s, yet with the liminality and lack of concrete placement we have seen in the maidservants’ children.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although commentators stress the idea that the maidservants of Jacob were taken by him as wives rather than concubines (Radak 30:5; <i>Bekhor Shor</i> 30:9), midrashic strains emphasize the awareness by the brothers that there existed (at least in potential) a hierarchy among Jacob’s women, with Rachel and Leah clearly superior to their maidservants. Thus, Joseph falsely reported to Jacob that the sons of Leah were deriding the maidservants’ sons (BR 84:7; <i>Tan. VaYeshev</i> 7), or alternatively that the maidservants’ sons were eating limbs torn off living animals, a strong taboo within their family traditions (BR 84:7; PRE 38). Though the midrash also presented all four women as daughters of Laban, Bilhah and Zilpah started out life with the inferior status as offspring borne from Laban’s concubines (BR 74:13); their status remained that of maidservants until Jacob took them as wives (according to one midrash, this happened only after the deaths of Rachel and Leah; <i>Pa’aneaĥ</i> <i>Razah,</i> Genesis 27:2).</i> Like Dan, he, more than any of Leah’s natural-born sons, marked the furthest reaches of his mother’s salient characteristic. Leah was here at her most aggressive in pursuing her husband’s affections – and in securing her place of dominance as the head mother. His personality, like Dan’s, reflected the unique circumstances of his birth. His name reflected the complexity of his situation.",
            "Leah named him simply, but stealthily: “And Leah said, ‘<i>bagad</i>’ – thereupon she called him ‘Gad’” (Genesis 30:11). This enigmatic statement contained many possible connotations, and commentators are torn as to what she meant. First, the most obvious, somewhat sinister reading: the word <i>bagad</i> is built off of the root <i>b-g-d</i>, treachery. Leah was schooled in deception, having passed herself off as her sister on her wedding night, betraying Jacob. Here, she again usurped her sister’s place. The midrash highlighted this problematic element of Leah’s strong will by claiming that, in this surrogacy, Leah repeated her first deceit. She dressed Zilpah in her garment,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Her <i>beged</i>, from the same root <i>b-g-d</i>. <i>Sefer Ha-Ĥasidim,</i> 480.</i> thus duping Jacob again.",
            "Leah thus acknowledged the dark side of her tenacity. She named her son after her aggressiveness in claiming her role as the dominant wife, celebrating, but confessing her ill-gained status.",
            "This dark potential to pursue one’s own resolve at the expense of others surfaced again, in the tribe’s future, albeit with a twist. After the nation defeated the mighty kings Sihon and Og, Gad requested to settle in those conquered lands on the east bank of the Jordan. Moses accused the tribe of betraying the nation by claiming their portion on the “wrong” side of the Jordan.",

            "Gad denied the accusation, and generously offered to lead the nation in battle against Canaan until all of the other tribes were settled. Rather than treachery, Gad ended up expressing the positive side of aggressiveness: the ability to fight and to lead.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Commentators have proffered that in choosing this name, Leah was joyously exclaiming her luck in this condensed version of “בא גד” – “fortune has come!” (Rashi, Rashbam, Genesis 30:11.) To avoid the generic blandness of “fortune,” the midrash imbues the name with the significance of a prophecy: In what way was Gad fortunate? He inherited his <i>naĥalah </i>before the other brothers (<i>Targum Yerushalmi</i>, Genesis 30:11).<br>With this reading, Gad’s name was formed from the verb <i>b-w-’</i>, meaning “to come,” with an elided <i>aleph</i>, compounded with the noun <i>gad</i>, meaning “fortune.” An alternative explanation relies on building the name off of the root <i>g-d-d</i>, which means “to sever”; a midrash therefore extrapolates that his name indicated that the boy was born already circumcised (Rashi on 30:11, quoting unnamed midrash). Fortunate for him, indeed!</i>",
            "The most likely germane understanding of Gad’s name relied on the root <i>g-d-d</i>, but saw the origin of Leah’s inspiration in the word <i>gedud</i>, meaning “troops,” or “slayers.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ibn Ezra, Genesis 30:1.</i> “The warrior has arrived!” announced Leah.

            "There is little in the text concerning Gad’s personal life, a fact consistent for exactly half of Jacob’s sons. Rabbinic midrash also does not single out any noteworthy vignettes from Gad’s life. Interestingly, however, the pseudepigraphal <i>Testament of Gad</i> traces early expressions of this warrior spirit in Gad’s personal life. It claims that Gad, more so than his brothers, particularly hated Joseph. Gad, as per this account, was a very brave shepherd. When the herd was attacked by wild animals, he took the predator by one of its legs, whirled it over his head and flung it away. It happened once that Gad saved a lamb from the jaws of a bear; he then reluctantly had to slaughter the lamb because it was so badly injured. Upon seeing this, Joseph misunderstood and reported to his father that Gad had killed one of the flock to eat, implying that he was careless with his father’s animals. On his deathbed, Gad confessed to his children that he had since harbored a maniacal hatred toward Joseph. He concluded by reminding them that he almost died of liver illness, which he attributed to acrimonious bile pooling in his liver.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“As my liver felt no mercy toward Joseph, unmerciful suffering was caused unto me by my liver” (<i>Testament of Gad</i>, 2).

The iron chariots of the Canaanite army could not ascend to the Israelite encampment on higher ground. It is therefore possible that the Israelites could have held out until that strategic moment when the rains and floodwaters streaming down from the Carmel and Ramat Manasseh just to the south swelled the Kishon and made the Canaanite defeat inevitable. Deborah then called: “Arise! For this is the day that God will deliver Sisera into your hand. Behold, God has gone forth before you!” (Judges 4:14).",

            "To address that question, we must explore how <i>Naĥalat Menasheh</i> was split among his descendants. The <i>naĥalah </i>was divided into ten tracts, inherited by the six sons of Gilead son of Machir son of Manasseh:",
            "<small>For the children of Abiezer, for the children of Helek, for the children of Asriel, for the children of Shechem, for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida. Those were the male descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph, by their clans. Now Zelophehad son of Hepher son of Gilead son of Machir son of Manasseh had no sons, but only daughters. The names of his daughters were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. They appeared before the priest Elazar, Joshua son of Nun, and the chieftains, saying: “God commanded Moses to give us a <i>naĥalah </i>among our brethren.” So in accordance with the Lord’s instructions, they were granted a portion among their father’s kinsmen. <i>Ten</i> districts fell to Manasseh – besides the land of Gilead and the Bashan that were across the Jordan. Manasseh’s daughters inherited a <i>naĥalah </i>in these together with his sons.<br>Joshua 17:2–6</small>",
            "This reference to the original story in Numbers 27 condensed a much longer narrative. The five daughters of Zelophehad approached Moses and requested that their father’s portion remain theirs, rather than be granted to his male relatives. Moses consulted with God, who commanded him to heed the women’s request. When the land was finally apportioned in the days of Joshua, it was divided among ten of Gilead’s descendants.",
            "The simple meaning of Joshua 17:6, preceded as it is by the story of Zelophehad’s daughters’ request, is that <i>Naĥalat Menasheh</i> was divided into ten regions, five granted to the sons of Gilead who have male descendants, and the other five granted to the daughters of Zelophehad. As there was a <i>ĥevel Aviezer</i>, there was a <i>ĥevel Tirzah</i>.",
            "As difficult as this explanation is,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For alternative interpretations of the ten divisions within <i>Naĥalat Menasheh</i>, see Malbim, <i>ad loc.</i>, and <i>Bava Batra</i> 116b.</i> it does seem to fit the simple meaning of the text, considering that the daughters of Zelophehad were essentially each inheriting a whole portion alongside their great-uncles as opposed to collectively inheriting the territory of their father. Archaeological evidence also backs this account of how <i>Naĥalat Menasheh</i> was allocated among five sons and five great-granddaughters of Gilead. The Shomron ostraca is a cache of sixty-four inscribed pottery sherds from the late ninth to the early eighth centuries Bce. These sherds, written in the capital of the Israelite kingdom, served as receipts of sale or some form of bookkeeping, and provide evidence that each of Zelophehad’s daughters inherited her own portion within Manasseh’s territory.",
            "These ostraca, written in an ancient Hebrew script, basically followed a standard formula: year, territory from where goods ostensibly originated, name of government official(s), product. On some of the ostraca, the territory names given are recognizable as clans from Manasseh. Alongside Shemida and Abiezer were found ostraca inscribed with the clan names Hoglah and Noah, irrefutable proof that each of Zelophehad’s daughters separately constituted one of the ten divisions of the <i>naĥalah </i>referenced in Joshua 17.",
            "Yoel Elitzur suggested that a closer examination of the ostraca might reveal a more precise location for <i>ĥevel Ĥoglah</i>. The two ostraca that mention Hoglah also reference Yazith as a specific village in that <i>ĥevel</i>. “Yazith” was found on three additional ostraca; on one of them, the government official is listed as Aĥnoam, who was also apparently administrator over Geba.",
            "Geba and another village, Bedan, are often mentioned together in rabbinic literature as neighboring locales that were blessed with superior produce. All three of these villages – Yazith, Geba, and Bedan – were located within a twelve-kilometer (approx. seven-mile) radius between Mount Ebal and the Sanur Valley. This area is the most likely contender for <i>ĥevel</i> <i>Ĥoglah</i>.",
            "Hoglah’s region, as of this writing, is inaccessible to the casual tourist. It remains in the national conscience, though, as a unique treasure, for it symbolizes the passionate love for <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> as a family legacy. The daughters of Zelophehad could have forfeited their father’s birthright to their male relatives; instead, they asserted their right to their father’s land, demonstrating a resolve missing from the many others at the time who shied away from claiming rights to all of their God-given property. These women sacrificed personal choice by readily agreeing to marry within Manasseh, so that their inherited land would remain within the tribe. Such was their devotion to their father’s name, such was their ironclad determination to settle the land, no matter the obstacles.",
            "This passion to fight for one’s birthright was answered with blessing, both ancient and new. <i>Ĥevel Ĥoglah</i> was home in antiquity to Yazith, Geba, and Bedan, and produced “the choicest pomegranates and hay.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Kelim</i> 17:5; <i>Orlah</i> 3:7.</i> In the more recent past, there were two small Jewish villages in the area, Sa-nur and Homesh.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These were settled in the 1970s and 1980s.

It is no great stretch to see in these settlers a reincarnation of the indomitable spirit of Zelophehad’s daughters. Indeed, it was the spirit of Zelophehad himself, as one of the <i>ma’apilim</i> who surged forward desperately toward <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, though he died en route.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">YS,<i> Shelaĥ</i> 745.

Underexplored and almost forgotten by most Israelis, this area is a wealth of beauty and history. Northern Samaria lies south of Wadi Ara (Nahal Iron) and the Jezreel Valley. Wadi Ara is the eastern bend in the famed Via Maris – the “Way of the Sea” – one of the most important routes in antiquity. Armies, caravanserai, and travelers inevitably passed through this riverbed valley as they made their way from Egypt toward Damascus, and then on to Mesopotamia. It is still a popular route to travel from the center of the country toward the northeast region.",
            "South of Wadi Ara is Mevo Dotan, one of the few remaining Jewish communities in northern Samaria. Enter the <i>yishuv</i> and follow the signs to Maoz Tzvi Farm (Havat Mevo Dotan), a quaint caravan outpost on a hilltop that affords the very best view of the Dothan Valley (ask the locals – there are always some milling around – to point you in the direction of the nicely kept lookout post).",
            "Dothan Valley is the northernmost and largest valley in the valley series that cuts through Samaria. The panorama legend and audio explanations available at the lookout post help identify the most important locations in the valley. Jenin is to the north; also visible in the distance are the Gilboa mountains, the site of Saul’s fatal battle against the Philistines. This is likely as close as many of us will get to Tel Dotan, the low trapezoidal hill just to the west on the horizon after Mevo Dotan.",
            "This biblical city likely received its name from the ancient double wells that are still extant (<i>dot</i> means “pit,” and <i>dothan</i> is “dual pits”). There are several indications that this tel is indeed the site of ancient Dothan: the tel retains its name in Arabic, which fits the various historical records of Dothan’s location, and it has an archaeological record that aligns well with the historical account of Dothan.",
            "Recall that the <i>shevatim</i>, angry and jealous of Joseph, set out from Hebron to Shechem, a distance of more than a hundred kilometers (over sixty miles). Their stated purpose? To shepherd their flocks. Perhaps they traveled so far north to attend to their father’s land holdings in the area,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 33:19.</i> or perhaps they sought to distance themselves significantly from Joseph. What is particularly strange is that they did not end their journey there, but traveled even farther north, up to Dothan. As Joseph set out to find them, he had an unusual encounter:",
            "<small>When he reached Shechem, a man came upon him wandering in the fields. The man asked him, “What are you looking for?” He answered, “I am looking for my brothers. Could you tell me where they are pasturing?” The man said, “They have gone from here, for I heard them say: Let us go to Dothan.” So Joseph followed his brothers and found them at Dothan.<br>Genesis 37:14–17</small>",
            "One suggestion is that they headed farther north because the grazing lands around Shechem had already been stripped bare – as resources were drained, people naturally moved farther north, toward the more watered terrain. Interestingly, this nomadic wandering from the southern Hebron hills up to northern Samaria is an ageless phenomenon: in the nineteenth century, Bedouin from the village of Ar’ara (near Dimona) moved up to northern Samaria and established an Ar’ara in that area as well.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">רביב ואלינסון, חלק א׳, 240.</i>",

In that reference, Judith was cited as an example of female heroism in the battle against the Hellenistic Syrian threat from the period of the Maccabean revolt.</i> And in our day, this valley was host to one of the pivotal and bloody battles of the Six Day War in 1967 that resulted in Israeli victory and subsequent Israeli building projects in northern Samaria.",

This site sits on Mount Amir, the mountain that formed the northern border of Samaria and was heavily settled by Manasseh during the early Israelite and First Temple periods. El-Ahwat is an intriguing candidate for the site of Harosheth-hagoiim, headquarters of Sisera, the general of King Jabin’s army in the days of Deborah. Sisera led a formidable squadron of nine hundred iron chariots, with which he maintained control over the Jezreel Valley, and effectively cut off the northern tribes from Manasseh and the southern tribes.",

Shiloh had been a well-fortified city in the Middle Bronze period (2000–1550 Bce), attested to by the excavated five-meter-thick walls (approx. sixteen feet thick) covered by an earthen glacis. Whether the Canaanite inhabitants were still in the city when the Israelites took over the place is not certain. There is no archaeological record of a destruction layer dating to the Israelite conquest, and the biblical text does not mention any battle for the site. Thus Joshua found in Shiloh a ready-made city, either abandoned or readily captured, with fine water resources, easily accessible via the central mountain range artery.",
            "Much of what there is to see on Tel Shiloh dates to later periods: Second Temple era structures, Byzantine churches, and a Muslim <i>mak’am </i>(holy site). There is ample evidence, though, of a settlement here in the time of the Judges (Iron I) and First Temple era (Iron II). Just outside of the Canaanite (MB) western fortifications are typical Israelite four-room houses that seemed to have been used both as storage facilities and as domiciles. A large collection of collared-rim storage jars, typical to the Iron I Israelite period, was discovered in situ. Carbon testing of charred olive pits found in one of them helped date the jars definitively to the era of the Judges.",
            "Positive identification of the site as biblical Shiloh is a recent development.

It was only in 2006, though, that a church inscription, dating to the fourth century CE, was uncovered, asking the Lord to have mercy on Seilun and its inhabitants. This discovery removed any doubt that this place was indeed ancient Shiloh.",

The High Priest Eli was seated outside the <i>Mishkan</i> when he heard the commotion in the city and demanded a report.

            "Our next stop is Tel el-Ful (literally Hill of Beans),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">An alternative explanation for the eponym Tel el-Ful is that “Ful” is the Arabic pronunciation of “Paul,” which itself is the Greek version of Saul. The contemporary place name thus retains traces of the site’s original name: Gibeah of Saul.</i> located just west of Pisgat Ze’ev and overlooking the Arab neighborhood of Shuafat. There’s not much to see of the excavations that were carried out sporadically between 1868 and 1964. Archaeologists uncovered a double-walled rectangular fortress with four corner towers, as well as some interesting smaller finds, such as a gaming board and kitchen utensils. The site underwent four different periods of settlement and destruction. The archaeological record fully accords with the various events as recorded in <i>Tanakh</i>, and a visit to the site demands that you come with <i>Tanakh</i> in hand to review those events and ponder their significance.",
            "When you arrive, carefully make your way to the second floor of the skeleton of the monumental building on the crest of Tel el-Ful. You are now in what was intended to be a summer home for King Hussein of Jordan. He commissioned this palace in 1964 to further secure his standing on the “west bank” of what was then Jordan. His contractor managed to complete the shell of this royal residence before the Six Day War broke out and then the area fell to sovereign Israel. Cautiously pick your way around this somewhat dilapidated palace. You’ll be transported right back to 1967, when this unfinished Arab chateau built on the ruins of the colossal palace of King Saul fell into the astonished hands of the Israeli army.",
            "This site was originally known as Gibeah, and was clearly located in <i>Naĥalat Binyamin</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Chronicles 11:31. The scholarly consensus on this matter was interrupted by I. Finkelstein in 2011, who dated the excavations to the Iron II rather than Iron I period and therefore rejected identifying the site with biblical Gibeah. See his “Tel el-Ful Revisted: The Assyrian and Hellenistic Periods (with a New Identification),” <i>PEQ</i> 143, 2 (2011): 106–18.</i> The first reference to the city is in Judges 19, which recounted one of the darkest moments in our history. A Levite living in <i>Naĥalat Ephraim</i> (in southern Samaria, abutting the northern border of <i>Naĥalat Binyamin</i>) pursued his <i>pilegesh</i> (concubine), who had fled south, back to her ancestral home in Bethlehem (in <i>Naĥalat Yehudah</i>). After spending a few days with her father, the Levite started traveling north, back to his home in Ephraim, with his <i>pilegesh</i> restored to him. The entourage approached Jebus (later to be known as <i>Ir David</i>, or Jerusalem) at evening, and were wary of staying overnight in a Gentile city. Instead, the Levite led his group to nearby Gibeah of Benjamin, the site where we are currently standing. He sat down expectantly in the town square, waiting for a townsman to offer hospitality. None was forthcoming, until an Ephramite who happened to be living in Gibeah welcomed him home. The Benjamite townsmen surrounded the house and demanded that the guest be relinquished to them. The Ephramite host offered his daughter and the visiting <i>pilegesh</i> instead. (Does the storyline sound familiar? Think back to Sodom and Lot’s guests.) The bloodthirsty mob grabbed the <i>pilegesh</i>, abused her all night, and left her to die on the threshold of the Ephramite’s home. One last gory detail has been seared in the mind of every reader of <i>Tanakh</i>: the Levite dismembered his <i>pilegesh</i>’s body and sent one piece to each <i>shevet</i> in Israel, as if to say, “You are all guilty for allowing <i>Shevet Binyamin</i> to act so inhumanely.”",
            "In response, all of <i>Benei Yisrael</i> banded together and insisted that <i>Shevet Binyamin</i> hand over the evildoers of Gibeah. When the Benjaminites refused, the nation rallied to war against them. After two crushing defeats, the national army was finally victorious and burned Gibeah to the ground. <i>Shevet Binyamin</i> was reduced to fewer than a thousand men, and the women were decimated. The nation vowed not to allow their daughters to marry into the tribe of Benjamin, fundamentally eradicating the <i>shevet</i>. Eventually realizing how tragic such an outcome would be, the Israelites captured four hundred women from Jabesh-gilead, a city in the Transjordan that had not participated in the battle against Gibeah and Benjamin, and gave those women to the small remnant of Benjaminites as wives. The sacrifice of Jabesh-gilead to salvage <i>Shevet Binyamin</i> was said to be rewarded some years later, bringing us to the next chapter of Gibeah’s history.",
            "When Saul from Benjamin was anointed king by Samuel (I Samuel 10), he ruled from his home in Gibeah, which was rebuilt after its destruction so many years earlier, during the terrible civil war. The place assumed a more regal title at this point: Gibeah of Saul. Now, the people of Jabesh-gilead, blood relatives of Benjamin (as explained in the story above), were threatened by their hostile neighbors, the Ammonites (led by their appropriately named king, Nahash). They appealed desperately to King Saul down in Gibeah of Saul, who galvanized the whole of Israel to aid Jabesh-gilead by doing something highly evocative: he took a pair of oxen, dismembered them, and sent the pieces throughout the regions of all twelve <i>shevatim</i>, warning them that their oxen would meet the same fate, if they did not join in battle against the Ammonites to save their brethren.",
            "With this act, the evil that once emanated from Gibeah was rectified. Once, the dismembered pieces sent throughout the land were human flesh, signifying both the moral decay of this tribe and the call for the rest of <i>Am Yisrael</i> to rid itself of such a depraved element from their midst. Now, the graphic symbol of dismembered flesh – issuing again from Gibeah – indicated just the opposite. In this pointed message from King Saul, the beloved hero of a rehabilitated tribe, <i>Am Yisrael</i> was once again charged to band together to rectify a wrong. This time, though, the threat was from an external enemy. This time, Gibeah served as the place from which justice emanated, rather than as the source of terrible violations. Benjamin came into his own, uniting the nation under his leadership. Benjamin – <i>shevet</i> and <i>naĥalah </i>–redeemed themselves.",
            "As we stand in Hussein’s empty and permanently unfinished palace, we recall one other event that took place right here, on Tel el-Ful, ancient Gibeah of Saul. Flavius Josephus told us that as the Roman general Vespasian besieged Jerusalem in 70 CE, his infamous Legion X was camped right here, awaiting assault directives to destroy the Temple. A visit to Gibeah of Saul is an auspicious moment to ponder how enemies of <i>Am Yisrael</i>, whether Roman, Arab, or, most tragically, our own in-fighting, can bring upon us such terrible destruction. The seeds of redemption, though, are also to be found in this place, where an ancient king transformed his nation from a people steeped in divisiveness and enmity to a strong and united Israel, bent on promoting justice."

Eyal Meiron, Shai Baitner, and Era Rappaport are masterful guides who motivated me early on in my career as a tour guide to “explore all the cracks and crevices of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, but do so barefoot – for with every step you are treading on <i>pesukim </i>(biblical verses).”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Credited to Yehuda Ziv.</i>",
            "I consider some <i>sefarim</i> my dearest companions; they certainly were indispensable in writing this manuscript. Firstly, R. Arye Hendler’s <i>חן מקום </i>and R. Matis Weinberg’s <i>Frameworks</i> sit lovingly on my shelf next to my <i>Tanakh</i>, and inspire me anew every time. The <i>עולם התנ״ך </i>series is timeless, as is <i>מדריך ישראל</i>. I thank Professor James Kugel for his significant contribution to the study of early biblical exegesis; his extremely readable <i>The Bible as It Was</i> has helped many students like myself deepen our appreciation for a wide variety of ancient source material. Dvir Raviv and Netanel Ellinson’s new series, <i>המדריך למטייל בשומרון</i>, as well as Yoel Elitzur’s recent <i>המקום בפרשה</i>, proved extremely useful, as you can see on these pages.",
            "Every page of this work reflects the wisdom of my editor and friend, the exceptionally talented Batnadiv HaKarmi-Weinberg, who also contributed the frontispiece. Anne Gordon’s expert copyediting polished everything to a high sheen. I thank Chava Boylan Neustadter and Raphaël Freeman of Renana Publishers for their patience and professionalism in helping this first-timer navigate the complexities of producing a book. Thank you to the ever-gracious Michael Silverstein for preparing the maps and the overall graphic design of the book. The gorgeous artwork which graces the cover and opening page of each chapter is courtesy of Jerusalem artist Bracha Lavee.",
            "The second edition of this book was nurtured along by my dear friend and publisher, the perpetually cheerful Mechael Pomeranz; Mechael, I hope our paths cross often, so that I may continue to learn from your gentle and genteel ways.",
            "This edition benefited primarily from the addition of Rabbanit Shani Taragin’s foreword. Wisdom and grace compete for dominance in Shani, a <i>ma’ayan mitgaber</i> figure to her thousands of students worldwide. Shani, epitome of Yehudah – I am <i>modeh</i> to an אהבה שאינה תלויה בדבר. May your voice, in shiur or on the written page, continue to inspire multitudes.",
            "Many thanks are due to my friends Chana Tannenbaum and Esti Herskowitz, who each read through the manuscript and offered extremely helpful feedback. Thanks as well to Elli Fischer, for help with translating a difficult passage in the <i>Paĥad Yitzĥak</i>; to Yair Shalev, for many insightful hours spent in conversation about the eastern Shomron; and to Shai Baitner, for sharing his expertise in Jordan.",
            "Thank you to my dearest in-laws, Helaine and Richard Weissman, for always having my back and showering us all with so much love and support. Mostly, though, I thank you for making Ira into the man, husband, and father he is today – without him, there would be no book!",
            "This work is dedicated to my parents, Barbara and Kenneth Lasson, who always believed in me and supported me, giving me the unconditional love that allowed me to pursue my passions. May this book give you much joy, and may you continue to have only <i>naĥat</i> from your children and grandchildren.",
            "Finally, thank you to the <i>Borei Olam</i>, who has sustained us and brought us home, allowing us to live in this miraculous time. May Jacob’s vision be realized, in our days.",
