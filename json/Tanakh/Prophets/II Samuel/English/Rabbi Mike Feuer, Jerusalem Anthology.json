            "And the king and his men went to Jerusalem to the Jebusite[s], the inhabitants of the land, who spoke to David, saying: 'you shall not come here unless you remove the blind and the lame'; as if to say: 'David shall not come here.' ",
            "And David conquered the stronghold of Zion which is the city of David. ",
            "And David said on that day; \"Whoever smites the Jebusites and reaches the tower, and [removes] the lame and the blind, despised by the soul of David.\" Therefore they say; \"The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.\" ",
            "And David dwelt in the stronghold and he called it the city of David. And David built round about from the mound and inward. ",
            "And David grew steadily greater, and the Lord the God of Hosts [was] with him."

            "And David built there an altar to the Lord, and he offered up burnt-offerings and peace offerings. And the Lord was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel."
