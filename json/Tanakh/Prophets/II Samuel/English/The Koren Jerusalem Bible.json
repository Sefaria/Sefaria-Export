            "it came to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Sha᾽ul, with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and bowed down.",
            "And David said to him, From where dost thou come? And he said to him, Out of the camp of Yisra᾽el am I escaped.",
            "And David said to him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Sha᾽ul and Yehonatan his son are dead also.",
            "And David said to the young man that told him, How dost thou know that Sha᾽ul and Yehonatan his son are dead?",
            "And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Sha᾽ul leaned upon his spear: and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.",
            "And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. And I answered, Here I am.",
            "And he said to me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an ῾Amaleqite.",
            "He said to me again, Stand, I pray thee, beside me, and slay me: for the agony has seized me, and yet I still have life in me.",
            "So I stood beside him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.",

            "And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.",
            "And David said to him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth has testified against thee, saying, I have slain the Lord’s anointed.",
