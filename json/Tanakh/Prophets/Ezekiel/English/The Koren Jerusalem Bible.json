            "the word of the Lord came to Yeĥezqel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of Kasdim by the river Kevar; and the hand of the Lord was there upon him.",

            "And when they moved, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, the noise of a tumult, like the noise of a host: when they stood still, they let down their wings.",
            "And there was a voice from above the firmament that was over their heads; when they stood still, they let down their wings.",

            "As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard the voice of one that spoke."
