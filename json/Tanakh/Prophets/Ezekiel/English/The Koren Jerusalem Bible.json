            "In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of the exile of king Yoyakhin,",
            "the word of the Lord came to Yeĥezqel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of Kasdim by the river Kevar; and the hand of the Lord was there upon him.",

            "Also out of the midst of it came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.",
            "And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.",
            "And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf’s foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass.",
            "And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and as for their faces and their wings (of those four)",
            "their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went everyone straight forward.",

            "And under the firmament their wings were held straight, the one toward the other: everyone had two, which covered them, namely, everyone two, which covered their bodies.",
            "And when they moved, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, the noise of a tumult, like the noise of a host: when they stood still, they let down their wings.",
            "And there was a voice from above the firmament that was over their heads; when they stood still, they let down their wings.",
            "And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, in appearance like a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.",

            "As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard the voice of one that spoke."
