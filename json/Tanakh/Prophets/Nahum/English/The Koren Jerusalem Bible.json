            "The burden of Nineve. The book of the vision of Naĥum the Elqoshite.",
            "The Lord is a jealous and revenging God; the Lord revenges, and is full of wrath; the Lord takes vengeance on \n\t\t\t\t\this adversaries, and he keeps wrath for his enemies.",
            "The Lord is slow to anger, and great in power, and will by no means acquit the wicked: the Lord, his way is in the tempest and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.",
            "He rebukes the sea, and makes it dry, and dries up all the rivers: Bashan languishes, and Karmel, and the flower of Levanon fades.",
            "The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is aroused at his presence, both the world, and all that dwell in it.",
            "Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken up by \n\t\t\t\t\thim.",
            "The Lord is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; and he knows them that trust in him.",
            "But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of her place, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.",
            "What do you contrive against the Lord? he will make an utter end: affliction shall not rise up the second time.",
            "For they are entangled with thorns, drunken as with their drink; they are devoured as stubble fully dry.",
            "There is one come out of thee, that contrives evil against the Lord, a wicked counsellor.",
            "Thus says the Lord; Though they are at peace, and likewise many, even so they shall be cut down, and it shall pass away. Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.",
            "For now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds asunder.",
            "And the Lord has given a commandment concerning thee, that no more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the carved idol and the molten image: I will make thy grave; for thou art vile."

            "Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that brings good tidings, that announces peace! O Yehuda, keep thy feasts, perform thy vows: for the wicked one shall no more pass through thee; he is utterly cut off.",
            "The batterer is come up against thee: guard the ramparts, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy power mightily.",
            "For the Lord restores the pride of Ya῾aqov, like the pride of Yisra᾽el: for plunderers have stripped them, and marred their vine branches.",
            "The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots glitter with steel in the day of his preparation, and the spears of cypress wood are brandished.",
            "The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall jostle one against another in the squares: they seem like torches, they run to and fro like lightnings.",
            "He remembers his valiant men: they stumble in their walk; they make haste to its wall, and the screen is prepared.",
            "The gates of the rivers are opened, and the palace is dissolved.",
            "It is set up; she is uncovered; she is carried away; and her maidens moan as with the voice of doves, drumming on their breasts.",
            "But Nineve is like a pool of water long established: yet they flee away. Halt, halt, they cry; but none turns back.",
            "Take the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for there is no end of the store: there is an abundance of all precious vessels.",
            "She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melts, and the knees knock together, and there is trembling in all loins, and the faces of them all are covered with blackness.",
            "Where is the den of the lions, and the feedingplace of the young lions, where the lion, and the lioness walked, and the lion’s whelp, and none made them afraid?",
            "The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey, and his dens with ravin.",
            "Behold, I am against thee, says the Lord of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions: and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard."

            "The horseman leaps up with his bright sword and glittering spear: and there is a multitude of slain, and a heap of carcasses; and there is no end of corpses; they stumble upon their corpses:",
            "because of the multitude of the harlotries of the charming and bewitching harlot, that sells nations through her lewd practices, and families through her witchcrafts.",
            "Behold, I am against thee, says the Lord of hosts; and I will uncover thy skirts upon thy face, and I will show the nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame.",
            "And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and will make thee like dung.",
            "And it shall come to pass, that all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee, and say, Nineve is laid waste: who will bemoan her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee?",
            "Art thou better than No-amon, that was situated among the rivers, that had the waters round about it, whose rampart was the sea, and her wall was from the sea?",
            "Kush the mighty, and Miżrayim without end; Put and Luvim were thy help;",
            "yet she went into Exile, into captivity: her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets: and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all her great men were bound in chains.",
            "Thou also shalt be drunken: thou shalt be dazed, thou also shalt seek a refuge from the enemy.",
            "All thy strongholds shall be like fig trees with the first ripe figs: if they are shaken, then they fall into the mouth of the eater.",

            "Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strongholds: go into the clay, and tread the mortar, take hold of the brick mould.",
            "There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it shall eat thee up like the locust: be swept away as with the locust, be swept away as with the swarming locust.",
            "Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven: the locust spreads itself, and flies away.",
            "Thy crowned ones are like the locusts, and thy captains like swarms of grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, but when the sun arises they flee away, and their place is not known where they are.",
            "Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Ashshur: thy nobles are at rest: thy people are scattered upon the mountains, and no man gathers them in.",
            "There is no healing for thy breach; thy wound is grievous: all that hear the report of thee clap the hands over thee: for upon whom has not thy wickedness passed continually?"
