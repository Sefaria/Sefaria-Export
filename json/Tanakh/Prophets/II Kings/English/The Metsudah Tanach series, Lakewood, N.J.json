            "[Then] Achazyohu fell through the lattice in his loft that was in Shomron, and he became ill. He sent messengers [to Ekron] and said to them, “Go inquire of Baal-Zevuv, the god of Ekron, if I will live [recover] from this illness.”",
            "An angel of Adonoy then spoke to Eliyohu, the Tishbi, “Arise [and] go up to meet the messengers of the king of Shomron, and speak to them [saying], ‘Is there no God in Yisroel that you are going to inquire of Baal-Zevuv, the god of Ekron?",
            "Therefore thus said Adonoy, “[From] the bed you have gone up onto, you will not go down from it for you will definitely die.’” And so Eliyohu departed.",
            "The messengers returned to him and he said to them, “Why have you returned?”",
            "And they said to him, “Adonoy man came up to [meet] us and said to us, ‘Go’ return to the king who sent you and speak to him [saying], this is what Adonoy has said, ‘Is there no God in Yisroel that you send to inquire of Baal-Zevuv’ the god of Ekron? Therefore the bed on which you have gone up you will not go down from it for you will definitely die.’”",
            "And he [the king] spoke to them, “What is the description of this man who came up to meet you and spoke to you these words?”",
            "And they said to him, “He was a hairy man and was girded with a leather belt around his waist.” He said, “He is Eliyohu, the Tishbi",
            "And he sent to him an officer over fifty [men] with his fifty [men]. He [the officer] went up to him, and there he [Eliyohu] was sitting at the top of a mountain. He said to him, “Man of God, the king said, ‘Come down.’”",
            "Eliyohu replied and spoke to the officer of the fifty [men]. “If I am really a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men.” A fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty [men].",
            "Once again he sent to him another officer of fifty [men] with his fifty [men], and he raised his voice and spoke to him, “Man of God, thus has the king spoken ‘Make it fast [and] come down.’”",
            "And Eliyohu replied and said to them, “If I am really a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty [men].” A fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty men.",
            "Once again, he sent a third officer of fifty [men] with his fifty [men]. The third officer went up and came, and bowed on his knees opposite Eliyohu and begged him and said to him, “Man of God, let my life be precious, and the lives of your servants, these fifty men, be [precious] in your eyes.",
            "Behold, a fire has come down from heaven, and consumed the first two officers of the fifty [men], and their fifty [men]. And now, let my life be precious in your eyes.”",
            "And the angel of Adonoy said to Eliyohu, “Go down with him, do not be afraid of him.” He then got up and went down with him to the king.",
            "And he spoke to him [the king], “Thus Adonoy has said, ‘Because you sent messengers to inquire of Baal-Zevuv, god of Ekron, is there no God in Yisroel to inquire of His word? Therefore, from the bed you have gone up onto, you will not get down from it, because you will definitely die.’”",
            "And he died in accordance with the word of Adonoy that Eliyohu had spoken, and Yehorom reigned in his place, in the second year of Yehorom, son of Yehoshophot, king of Yehudah, for he had no son.",

            "They approached — the disciples of the prophets who were in Yericho—Elisha and they said to him, “Do you know that today Adonoy is taking you master from upon your head?” He said, “I also know it! Be quiet.”",

            "And he took the cloak of Eliyohu that had fallen off of him, and struck the water, and said, “Where is Adonoy, the God of Eliyohu?” Then he also struck the water, and it split to this side and that side, and Elisha crossed over.",
            "They saw him— the disciples of the prophets who were in Yericho — from afar and said, “The spirit of Eliyohu has rested on Elisha.” They came to greet him and prostrated themselves before him to the ground.",
            "They said to him, “Behold, please, Your servants have fifty able bodied men; please let them go and search for your master, perhaps the wind of Adonoy carried him up and threw him on one of the mountains, or in one of the valleys.” And he said, “Do not send.”",
            "They pressured him until he was ashamed, and he said, “Send.” They sent fifty men and they searched for three days but did not find him.",
            "They returned to him as he was staying in Yericho, and he said to them, “Did I not say to you, ‘Do not go’?”",
            "The people of the city said to Elisha, “Behold, please the city is a good place to live, as my master sees, but the water is bad, and the land causes bereavement.”",
            "And he said, “Bring me a new jar and put salt in it,” and they brought it to him.",
            "He went out to the source of the water and threw salt there, and said, “Thus Adonoy has said, ‘I have cured these waters, there will no longer be from there a cause of death and bereavement.’”",
            "The waters were cured until this day, like the word that Elisha had spoken.",
            "He went up from there to Beis Eil, and as he was going up on the way, little boys came out from the city and taunted him and said to him, “Go away, baldy! Go away, baldy!”",
            "He turned around and saw them. He cursed them in the name of Adonoy. Two bears came out of the woods and tore apart forty-two of the boys.",
