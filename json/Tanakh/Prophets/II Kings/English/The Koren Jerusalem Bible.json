            "And Aĥazya fell down through the lattice in his upper chamber that was in Shomeron, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said to them, Go, inquire of Ba῾al-zevuv the god of ῾Eqron whether I shall recover from this disease.",
            "But the angel of the Lord said to Eliyya the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Shomeron and say to them, Is it because there is no God in Yisra᾽el, that you go to inquire of Ba῾al-zevuv the god of ῾Eqron?",
            "Now therefore thus says the Lord, Thou shalt not come down from that bed to which thou hast gone up, but shalt surely die. And Eliyya departed.",
            "And when the messengers turned back to him, he said to them, Why have you returned?",
            "And they said to him, There came a man up to meet us, and said to us, Go, turn back to the king that sent you, and say to him, Thus says the Lord, Is it because there is no God in Yisra᾽el, that thou sendest to inquire of Ba῾al-zevuv the god of ῾Eqron? therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed to which thou hast gone up, but shalt surely die.",
            "And he said to them, What manner of man was he who came up to meet you, and told you these words?",
            "And they answered him, He was a hairy man, and with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Eliyya the Tishbite.",
            "Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of a hill. And he said to him, Thou man of God, the king said, Come down.",
            "And Eliyyahu answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And so fire came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.",
            "Again he also sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said to him, O man of God, the king said thus, Come down quickly.",
            "And Eliyya answered and said to them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.",
            "And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Eliyyahu, and pleaded with him, and said to him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.",
            "Behold, fire came down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight.",
            "And the angel of the Lord said to Eliyyahu, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him to the king.",
            "And he said to him, Thus says the Lord, Since thou hast sent messengers to inquire of Ba῾al-zevuv the god of ῾Eqron, is it because there is no God in Yisra᾽el to inquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed of which thou hast gone up, but shalt surely die.",
            "So he died according to the word of the Lord which Eliyyahu had spoken. And Yehoram reigned in his stead    in the second year of Yehoram the son of Yehoshafat king of Yehuda; because he had no son.",

            "And the sons of the prophets that were at Bet-el came out to Elisha, and said to him, Knowst thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yes, I know it; hold your peace.",

            "And the sons of the prophets that were at Yeriĥo came to Elisha, and said to him, Knowst thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered, Yes, I know it; hold your peace.",

            "And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father the chariots of Yisra᾽el, and their horsemen. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.",
            "He took up also the mantle of Eliyyahu that had fallen from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of the Yarden;",
            "and he took the mantle of Eliyyahu that had fallen from him, and struck the water, and said, Where is the Lord God of Eliyyahu? and when he also had struck the waters, they parted to one side and to the other: and Elisha went over.",
            "And when the sons of the prophets who were in Yeriĥo saw him, they said, The spirit of Eliyyahu rests on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.",
            "And they said to him, Behold now, there are with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest perhaps the spirit of the Lord has taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Do not send.",
            "And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.",
            "And when they came back to him, (for he tarried at Yeriĥo,) he said to them, Did I not say to you, Do not go?",
            "And the men of the city said to Elisha, Behold, we pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord may see: but the water is bad, and the ground causes untimely births.",
            "And he said, Bring me a new flask, and put salt in it. And they brought it to him.",
            "And he went out to the spring of the waters, and cast salt in there, and said, Thus says the Lord, I have healed this water; there shall not be from there any more death or miscarriage.",
            "So the water was healed to this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spoke.",
            "And he went up from there to Bet-el: and as he was going up by the way, some small boys came out of the city, and jeered at him, and said to him, Go up, bald head; go up, bald head.",
            "And he turned back, and looked at them, and cursed them in the name of the Lord. And two she bears came out of the wood, and tore forty two of the children.",

            "And on the ninth day of the (fourth) month the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.",
            "And a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which is by the king’s garden: (now the Kasdim were against the city round about:) and they went in the direction of the ῾Arava.",
            "And the army of the Kasdim pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Yeriĥo: and all his army were scattered from him.",
            "So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Bavel to Rivla; and they gave judgment upon him.",

            "But the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land to be vinedressers and fieldworkers.",
            "And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the Lord, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the Lord, did the Kasdim break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Bavel.",
            "And the pans, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered, they took away.",
            "And the firepans, and the basins, and such things as were of gold, in gold, and of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away.",
            "The pillars, one sea, and the bases which Shelomo had made for the house of the Lord; the brass of all these vessels was without weight.",
            "The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the capital upon it was brass: and the height of the capital three cubits; and there was wreathen work, and pomegranates upon the capital round about, all of brass: and like capital round about, all of brass: and like thee with wreathen work was the second pillar also.",
            "And the captain of the guard took Seraya the chief priest, and Żefanyahu a priest of the second order, and the three keepers of the door:",
            "and out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war, and five men of them that were in the king’s presence, who were found in the city, and the scribe, of the commander of the host, who kept the muster of the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the city:",
            "and Nevuzar᾽adan captain of the guard took these, and brought them to the king of Bavel to Rivla:",
            "and the king of Bavel smote them, and slew them at Rivla in the land of Ḥamat. So Yehuda was carried away out of their land.",
            "And as for the people that remained in the land of Yehuda, whom Nevukhadneżżar king of Bavel had left, he appointed Gedalyahu the son of Aĥiqam, the son of Shafan over them.",
            "And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard that the king of Bavel had made Gedalyahu governor, they came to Gedalyahu to Miżpa, also Yishma᾽el the son of Netanya, and Yoĥanan the son of Qareaĥ, and Seraya the son of Tanĥumat the Netofati, and Ya᾽azanyahu the son of the Ma῾akhati, they and their men.",
            "And Gedalyahu swore to them, and to their men, and said to them, Fear not to be the servants of the Kasdim: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Bavel; and it shall be well with you.",
            "But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Yishma᾽el the son of Netanya, the son of Elishama, of the royal seed, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedalyahu, that he died, together with the men of Yehuda and the Kasdim that were with him of Miżpa.",
            "And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the armies, arose, and came to Miżrayim: for they were afraid of the Kasdim.",
            "And it came to pass in the thirty seventh year of the captivity of Yehoyakhin king of Yehuda, in the twelfth month, on the twenty seventh day of the month, that Evil-merodakh king of Bavel in the year that he began to reign did lift up the head of Yehoyakhin king of Yehuda out of prison;",
            "and he spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the other kings that were with him in Bavel;",
            "and he changed his prison garments: and he did eat bread continually before him all the days of his life:",
            "and as for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him by the king, a daily portion for every day, all the days of his life."
