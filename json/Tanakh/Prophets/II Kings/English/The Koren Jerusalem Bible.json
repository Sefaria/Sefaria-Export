            "Then Mo᾽av rebelled against Yisra᾽el after the death of Aĥ᾽av.",
            "And Aĥazya fell down through the lattice in his upper chamber that was in Shomeron, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said to them, Go, inquire of Ba῾al-zevuv the god of ῾Eqron whether I shall recover from this disease.",
            "But the angel of the Lord said to Eliyya the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Shomeron and say to them, Is it because there is no God in Yisra᾽el, that you go to inquire of Ba῾al-zevuv the god of ῾Eqron?",
            "Now therefore thus says the Lord, Thou shalt not come down from that bed to which thou hast gone up, but shalt surely die. And Eliyya departed.",
            "And when the messengers turned back to him, he said to them, Why have you returned?",
            "And they said to him, There came a man up to meet us, and said to us, Go, turn back to the king that sent you, and say to him, Thus says the Lord, Is it because there is no God in Yisra᾽el, that thou sendest to inquire of Ba῾al-zevuv the god of ῾Eqron? therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed to which thou hast gone up, but shalt surely die.",
            "And he said to them, What manner of man was he who came up to meet you, and told you these words?",
            "And they answered him, He was a hairy man, and with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Eliyya the Tishbite.",
            "Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of a hill. And he said to him, Thou man of God, the king said, Come down.",
            "And Eliyyahu answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And so fire came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.",
            "Again he also sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said to him, O man of God, the king said thus, Come down quickly.",
            "And Eliyya answered and said to them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.",
            "And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Eliyyahu, and pleaded with him, and said to him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.",
            "Behold, fire came down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight.",
            "And the angel of the Lord said to Eliyyahu, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him to the king.",
            "And he said to him, Thus says the Lord, Since thou hast sent messengers to inquire of Ba῾al-zevuv the god of ῾Eqron, is it because there is no God in Yisra᾽el to inquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed of which thou hast gone up, but shalt surely die.",
            "So he died according to the word of the Lord which Eliyyahu had spoken. And Yehoram reigned in his stead    in the second year of Yehoram the son of Yehoshafat king of Yehuda; because he had no son.",
            "Now the rest of the acts of Aĥazyahu which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Yisra᾽el?"

            "And the sons of the prophets that were at Bet-el came out to Elisha, and said to him, Knowst thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yes, I know it; hold your peace.",
            "And Eliyyahu said to him, Elisha, remain here, I pray thee; for the Lord has sent me to Yeriĥo. And he said, As the Lord lives, and as thy soul lives, I will not leave thee. So they came to Yeriĥo.",
            "And the sons of the prophets that were at Yeriĥo came to Elisha, and said to him, Knowst thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered, Yes, I know it; hold your peace.",
            "And Eliyyahu said to him, Remain, I pray thee, here; for the Lord has sent me to the Yarden. And he said, As the Lord lives, and as thy soul lives, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.",
            "And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood opposite them afar off: and they two stood by the Yarden.",
            "And Eliyyahu took his mantle, and rolled it up, and struck the water, and it was divided to one side and to the other, so that they two went over on dry ground.",
            "And it came to pass, when they had gone over, that Eliyyahu said to Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I am taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.",

            "And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them from one another, and Eliyyahu went up by a storm of wind into heaven.",
            "And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father the chariots of Yisra᾽el, and their horsemen. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.",
            "He took up also the mantle of Eliyyahu that had fallen from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of the Yarden;",
            "and he took the mantle of Eliyyahu that had fallen from him, and struck the water, and said, Where is the Lord God of Eliyyahu? and when he also had struck the waters, they parted to one side and to the other: and Elisha went over.",
            "And when the sons of the prophets who were in Yeriĥo saw him, they said, The spirit of Eliyyahu rests on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.",
            "And they said to him, Behold now, there are with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest perhaps the spirit of the Lord has taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Do not send.",
            "And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.",
            "And when they came back to him, (for he tarried at Yeriĥo,) he said to them, Did I not say to you, Do not go?",
            "And the men of the city said to Elisha, Behold, we pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord may see: but the water is bad, and the ground causes untimely births.",
            "And he said, Bring me a new flask, and put salt in it. And they brought it to him.",
            "And he went out to the spring of the waters, and cast salt in there, and said, Thus says the Lord, I have healed this water; there shall not be from there any more death or miscarriage.",
            "So the water was healed to this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spoke.",
            "And he went up from there to Bet-el: and as he was going up by the way, some small boys came out of the city, and jeered at him, and said to him, Go up, bald head; go up, bald head.",
            "And he turned back, and looked at them, and cursed them in the name of the Lord. And two she bears came out of the wood, and tore forty two of the children.",

            "Nevertheless he held fast to the sins of Yorov῾am the son of Nevat, who made Yisra᾽el to sin; he departed not from that.",

            "And he said, Which way shall we go up? and he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom.",
            "So the king of Yisra᾽el went, and the king of Yehuda, and the king of Edom: and they made a circuit of seven days’ journey: and there was no water for the camp, and for the cattle that followed them.",
            "And the king of Yisra᾽el said, Alas! that the Lord has called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Mo᾽av!",
            "But Yehoshafat said, Is there not here a prophet of the Lord, that we may inquire of the Lord by him? And one of the king of Yisra᾽el’s servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shafat, who poured water on the hands of Eliyyahu.",
