            "Moreover thou knowst also what Yo᾽av the son of Żeruya did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Yisra᾽el, to Avner the son of Ner, and to ῾Amasa the son of Yeter, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.",

            "And of Izevel also the Lord spoke saying, The dogs shall eat Izevel by the wall of Yizre῾el.",
            "Him that dies of Aĥ᾽av in the city the dogs shall eat: and him that dies in the field the birds of the air shalt eat.",
            "But there was none like Aĥ᾽av, who did give himself over to work wickedness in the sight of the Lord, whom Izevel his wife did incite.",
            "And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all things as did the Emori, whom the Lord cast out before the children of Yisra᾽el.",

            "And the word of the Lord came to Eliyyahu the Tishbi, saying,",
            "Seest thou how Aĥ᾽av humbles himself before me? because he humbles himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: but in his son’s days will I bring the evil upon his house."
