            "And Shelomo said, If he will show himself a worthy man, no hair of his shall fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.",

            "and keep the charge of the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the Tora of Moshe, that thou mayst prosper in all that thou doest, and wherever thou turnest thyself:",
            "that the Lord may continue his word which he spoke concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Yisra᾽el.",
            "Moreover thou knowst also what Yo᾽av the son of Żeruya did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Yisra᾽el, to Avner the son of Ner, and to ῾Amasa the son of Yeter, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.",

            "And thou shalt speak to him, saying, Thus says the Lord, Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak to him, saying, Thus says the Lord, In the place where the dogs licked the blood of Navot shall the dogs lick thy blood, even thine.",
            "And Aĥ᾽av said to Eliyyahu, Hast thou found me, O my enemy? And he answered, I have found thee: because thou hast given thyself over to work evil in the eyes of the Lord.",

            "But there was none like Aĥ᾽av, who did give himself over to work wickedness in the sight of the Lord, whom Izevel his wife did incite.",
            "And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all things as did the Emori, whom the Lord cast out before the children of Yisra᾽el.",
            "And it came to pass, when Aĥ᾽av heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.",
            "And the word of the Lord came to Eliyyahu the Tishbi, saying,",
            "Seest thou how Aĥ᾽av humbles himself before me? because he humbles himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: but in his son’s days will I bring the evil upon his house."
