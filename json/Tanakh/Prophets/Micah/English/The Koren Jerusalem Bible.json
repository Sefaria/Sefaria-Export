            "The word of the Lord that came to Mikha the Morashtite in the days of Yotam, Aĥaz, Yeĥizqiyya, kings of Yehuda, which he saw concerning Shomeron and Yerushalayim.",
            "Hear, all you peoples; hearken, O earth, and all that is in it: and let the Lord God be witness against you, the Lord from \n\t\t\t\t\this holy temple.",
            "For, behold, the Lord comes out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.",
            "And the mountains shall melt under him, and the valleys shall be split, like wax before the fire, and like water that is poured down a steep place.",
            "All this is for the transgression of Ya῾aqov, and for the sins of the house of Yisra᾽el. What is the transgression of Ya῾aqov? is it not Shomeron? and what are the high places of Yehuda? are they not Yerushalayim?",
            "Therefore I will turn Shomeron into a heap of rubble in the field, into a place for planting vines; and I will pour her stones into the valley, and I will lay bare her foundations.",
            "And all her carved idols shall be beaten to pieces, and all her hires shall be burned with the fire, and all her idols will I lay desolate: for she gathered them of the hire of a harlot, and they shall return to the hire of a harlot.",
            "For this I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like jackals, and a mourning like owls.",
            "For her wound is incurable; for it has come as far as Yehuda; it has reached the gate of my people, to Yerushalayim.",
            "Declare it not at Gat, weep not at all: in Bet-le῾afra roll thyself in the dust.",
            "Pass away, thou inhabitant of Shafir in nakedness and shame: the inhabitant of Za᾽anan did not come forth to the mourning of Bet-ha᾽eżel: he will take away from you that standing still!",
            "For the inhabitant of Marot waited carefully for good tidings: but evil came down from the Lord to the gate of Yerushalayim.",
            "Harness the chariot to the steed, O inhabitant of Lakhish: she was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Żiyyon: for the transgressions of Yisra᾽el were found in thee.",
            "Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moreshet-gat: the houses of Akhziv are a dried up stream to the kings of Yisra᾽el.",
            "Yet will I bring an impropriator upon thee, O inhabitant of Maresha: the glory of Yisra᾽el shall come to ῾Adullam.",
            "Make thyself bald, and crop thy hair for the children of thy delight; make a wide baldness on thy head like a vulture; for they are exiled from thee."

            "Therefore thus says the Lord; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which you shall not remove your necks; nor shall you go haughtily: for it will be a time of evil.",
            "In that day shall they take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, saying, We are utterly spoiled: he changes the position of my people; how he removes it from me, and divides our field amongst renegades!",
            "Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast the line by lot in the congregation of the Lord.",

            "And he shall judge between many peoples, and decide concerning strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, nor shall they learn war any more.",
            "But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the Lord of hosts has spoken it.",
            "For let all people walk everyone in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.",

            "Now why dost thou cry out aloud? is there no king in thee? is thy counsellor perished? that pangs have seized thee as a woman in travail.",
            "Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Żiyyon, like a woman in travail: for now shalt thou go out of the city, and thou shalt dwell in the field, and thou shalt come to Bavel; there shalt thou be rescued; there the \n\t\t\t\t\tLord shall redeem thee from the hand of thy enemies.",
            "And now many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eyes look upon Żiyyon.",

            "Arise and thresh, O daughter of Żiyyon: for I will make thy horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt beat in pieces many peoples: and thou shalt devote their gain to the Lord, and their substance to the \n\t\t\t\t\tLord of the whole earth.",
