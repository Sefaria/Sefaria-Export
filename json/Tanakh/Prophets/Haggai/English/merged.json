            "In the second year of King Darius, on the first day of the sixth month, this word of G<small>OD</small> came through the prophet Haggai to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, the governor of Judah, and to Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest:",

            "Is it a time for you to dwell in your paneled houses, while this House is lying in ruins? ",
            "Now thus said G<small>OD</small> of Hosts: Consider how you have been faring!",
            "You have sowed much and brought in little; you eat without being satisfied; you drink without getting your fill; you clothe yourselves, but no one gets warm; and he who earns anything earns it for a leaky purse.",

            "and I have summoned fierce heat upon the land—upon the hills, upon the new grain and wine and oil, upon all that the ground produces, upon human and animal, and upon all the fruits of labor.",

            "So I promised you when you came out of Egypt, and My spirit is still in your midst. Fear not!",
