            "Ye have sown much, and brought in little, Ye eat, but ye have not enough, Ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink, Ye clothe you, but there is none warm; And he that earneth wages earneth wages For a bag with holes.",
            "Thus saith the LORD of hosts: Consider your ways.",

            "Therefore over you the heaven hath kept back, so that there is no dew, and the earth hath kept back her produce.",
            "And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the wine, and upon the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the hands.’",
            "Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, hearkened unto the voice of the LORD their God, and unto the words of Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him; and the people did fear before the LORD.",
