            "In the second year of King Darius, on the first day of the sixth month, this word of the L<small>ORD</small> came through the prophet Haggai to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, the governor of Judah, and to Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest:",
            "Thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts: These people say, <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">a</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lit. “It is not time for the coming of the time.”</i>“The time has not yet come<sup class=\"endFootnote\">-a</sup> for rebuilding the House of the L<small>ORD</small>.”",
            "And the word of the L<small>ORD</small> through the prophet Haggai continued:",
            "Is it a time for you to dwell in your paneled houses, while this House is lying in ruins?",
            "Now thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts: Consider how you have been faring!",
            "You have sowed much and brought in little; you eat without being satisfied; you drink without getting your fill; you clothe yourselves, but no one gets warm; and he who earns anything earns it for a leaky purse.<br>",
            "<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">b</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Vv. 7–8 would read well after v. 11.</i>Thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts: Consider how you have fared:",

Because of My House which lies in ruins, while you all hurry to your own houses!",
            "That is why the skies above you have withheld [their] moisture and the earth has withheld its yield,",
            "and I have summoned fierce heat upon the land—upon the hills, upon the new grain and wine and oil, upon all that the ground produces, upon man and beast, and upon all the fruits of labor.<br>",
            "Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and the high priest Joshua son of Jehozadak and all the rest of the people gave heed to the summons of the L<small>ORD</small> their God and to the words of the prophet Haggai, when the L<small>ORD</small> their God sent him; the people feared the L<small>ORD</small>.",
            "And Haggai, the L<small>ORD</small>’s messenger, fulfilling the L<small>ORD</small>’s mission, spoke to the people, “I am with you—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.”<br>",
