            "In the second year of Daryavesh the king, in the sixth month, on the first day of the month, the word of the Lord came by Ḥaggay the prophet to Zerubbavel the son of She᾽alti᾽el, governor of Yehuda, and to Yehoshua the son of Yehożadaq, the high priest, saying,",
            "Thus speaks the Lord of hosts, saying, This people say, The time is not come, the time that the Lord’s house should be built.",
            "Then the word of the Lord came by Ḥaggay the prophet, saying,",
            "Is it time for you, yourselves, to dwell in your well timbered houses, whilst this house lies waste?",
            "Now therefore thus says the Lord of hosts; Consider your ways.",
            "You have sown much, and bring in little; you eat, but you have not enough; you drink, but you are not filled with drink; you clothe yourselves, but no one is warm; and he that earns wages earns wages to put them into a bag with holes.",
            "Thus says the Lord of hosts; Consider your ways.",
            "Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, says the Lord.",
            "You looked for much, and, lo, it came to little; and when you brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why? says the Lord of hosts. Because of my house that lies waste, and everyone of you runs to his own house.",
            "Therefore the heaven over you is restrained from giving dew, and the earth is restrained from giving its produce.",
            "And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon that which the ground brings forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the hands.",
            "Then Zerubbavel the son of Shalti᾽el, and Yehoshua the son of Yehożadaq, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the \n\t\t\t\t\tLord their God, and the words of Ḥaggay the prophet, as the Lord their God had sent him, and the people feared before the \n\t\t\t\t\t\tLord.",
            "Then Ḥaggay the Lord’s messenger spoke the Lord’s message to the people, saying, I am with you, says the Lord.",
            "And the Lord stirred up the spirit of Zerubbavel the son of Shalti᾽el, governor of Yehuda, and the spirit of Yehoshua the son of Yehożadaq, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and worked in the house of the \n\t\t\t\t\tLord of hosts, their God,",
            "On the twenty fourth day of the sixth month, in the second year of Daryavesh the king."

            "In the seventh month, on the twenty first day of the month, the word of the Lord came by the prophet Ḥaggay, saying,",
            "Speak now to Zerubbavel the son of Shalti᾽el, governor of Yehuda, and to Yehoshua the son of Yehożadaq, the high priest, and to the residue of the people, saying,",
            "Who is left among you that saw this house in its first glory? and how do you see it now? is it not in your eyes as nothing?",
            "Yet now be strong, O Zerubbavel, says the Lord; and be strong, O Yehoshua, son of Yehożadaq, the high priest; and be strong, all you people of the land, says the  \t\t\t\t\tLord, and work: for I am with you, says the Lord of hosts,",
            "according to the word that I covenanted with you when you came out of Miżrayim, so my spirit remains among you: fear not.",
            "For thus says the Lord of hosts; Yet again, in just a little while, I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;",
            "and I will shake all the nations, and the costliest things of all the nations shall come; and I will fill this house with glory, says the Lord of hosts.",
            "The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, says the Lord of hosts.",
            "The glory of this latter house shall be greater than that of the former, says the Lord of hosts: and in this place I will give peace, says the Lord of hosts.",
            "On the twenty fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Daryavesh, the word of the Lord came by Ḥaggay the prophet, saying,",
            "Thus says the Lord of hosts; Ask now a Tora of the priests, saying,",
            "If one carries consecrated meat in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt he touches bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any food, does it become holy? And the priests answered and said, No.",
            "Then said Ḥaggay, If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It becomes unclean.",
            "Then Ḥaggay answered, and said, Such is this people, and such is this nation before me, says the Lord; and such is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.",
            "And now, I pray you, consider from this day onwards. Before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the Lord,",
            "when one came to a heap of twenty measures, there were but ten: when one came to the wine vat to draw out fifty measures of the press, there were but twenty.",
            "I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the labours of your hands; yet you turned not to me, says the Lord.",
            "But now consider from this day onwards, from the twenty fourth day of the ninth month, from the day that the foundation of the Lord’s temple was laid, consider it.",
            "Is the seed yet in the barn? and do the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, still not bring forth? from this day I will bless you.",
            "And again the word of the Lord came to Ḥaggay on the twenty fourth day of the month, saying,",
            "Speak to Zerubbavel, governor of Yehuda, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth;",
            "and I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, everyone by the sword of his brother.",
            "On that day, says the Lord of hosts, I will take thee, O Zerubbavel, my servant, the son of She᾽alti᾽el, says the  \t\t\t\t\tLord, and will make thee like a signet ring: for I have chosen thee, says the Lord of hosts."
