            "but unto Hannah he gave a double portion; for he loved Hannah, but the LORD had shut up her womb.", 
            "And her rival vexed her sore, to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.", 
            "And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she vexed her; therefore she wept, and would not eat.", 
            "And Elkanah her husband said unto her: ‘Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?’",

            "and she was in bitterness of soul—and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore.", 
            "And she vowed a vow, and said: ‘O LORD of hosts, if Thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of Thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget Thy handmaid, but wilt give unto Thy handmaid a man-child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.’", 
            "And it came to pass, as she prayed long before the LORD, that Eli watched her mouth.", 
            "Now Hannah, she spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice could not be heard; therefore, Eli thought she had been drunken.", 
            "And Eli said unto her: ‘How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.’", 
            "And Hannah answered and said: ‘No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit; I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I poured out my soul before the LORD.", 
            "Count not thy handmaid for a wicked woman: for out of the abundance of my complaint and my vexation have I spoken hitherto.’", 
            "Then Eli answered and said: ‘Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant thy petition that thou hast asked of Him.’", 
            "And she said: ‘Let thy servant find favour in thy sight.’ So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.",

            "But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband: ‘Until the child be weaned, when I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.’", 
            "And Elkanah her husband said unto her: ‘Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish His word.’ So the woman tarried and gave her son suck, until she weaned him.", 
            "And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh; and the child was young.",
