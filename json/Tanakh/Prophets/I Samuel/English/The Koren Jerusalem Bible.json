            "and he had two wives; the name of the one was Ḥanna, and the name of the other Peninna: and Peninna had children, but Ḥanna had no children.",
            "And this man went up out of his city year by year to worship and to sacrifice to the Lord of hosts in Shilo. And the two sons of ῾Eli, Ḥofni and Pineĥas, the priests of the Lord, were there.",
            "And when the time was that Elqana offered, he gave portions to Peninna his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters:",
            "but to Ḥanna he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Ḥanna: but the Lord had shut up her womb.",
            "And her rival also provoked her sore, to make her fret, because the Lord had shut up her womb.",
            "And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the Lord, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.",
            "Then Elqana her husband said to her, Ḥanna, why dost thou weep? and why dost thou not eat? and why is thy heart grieved? am I not better to thee than ten sons?",

            "And she vowed a vow, and said, O Lord of hosts, if Thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of Thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget Thy handmaid, but wilt give to Thy handmaid a man child, then I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life, and no razor shall come upon his head.",

            "And Ḥanna answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the Lord.",
            "Take not thy handmaid for a worthless woman: for out of the greatness of my complaint and grief have I been speaking.",
