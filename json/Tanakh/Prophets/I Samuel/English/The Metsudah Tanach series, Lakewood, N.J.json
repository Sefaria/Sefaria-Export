            "But to Chana he would give one choice portion, for he loved Chana, and Adonoy had closed her womb.",
            "Her rival would frequently anger her in order that she should complain, because Adonoy had closed her womb.",

            "But the youth Shmuel continued to grow and was in favor both with Adonoy and also with people.",
