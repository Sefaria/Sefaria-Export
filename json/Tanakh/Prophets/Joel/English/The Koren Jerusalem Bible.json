            "The word of the Lord that came to Yo᾽el the son of Petu᾽el.",
            "Hear this, you old men, and give ear, all you inhabitants of the land. Has such a thing been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers?",
            "Tell your children of it, and let your children tell their children, and their children another generation.",
            "That which the cutting locust has left, the swarming locust has eaten; and that which the swarming locust has left, the hopping locust has eaten; and that which the hopping locust has left, the destroying locust has eaten.",
            "Awake, drunkards, and weep; and howl, all you drinkers of wine, because of the sweet wine; for it is cut off from your mouth.",
            "For a nation is come up upon my land, mighty, and without number, whose teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he has the fangs of a lioness.",
            "He has laid my vine waste, and splintered my fig tree: he has made it clean bare, and cast it down; its branches are made white.",
            "Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.",
            "The meal offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the Lord; the priests, the Lord’s ministers, mourn.",
            "The field is wasted, the land mourns; for the corn is wasted: the new wine is dried up, the oil languishes.",
            "Be ashamed, O you farmers; wail, O you vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is perished.",
            "The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languishes; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, all the trees of the field, are withered because joy is withered away from the sons of men.",
            "Gird yourselves, and lament, you priests: wail, you ministers of the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, you ministers of my God: for the meal offering and the drink offering is withheld from the house of your \n\t\t\t\t\tGod.",
            "Sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the Lord your God, and cry to the \n\t\t\t\t\tLord.",
            "Alas for the day! for the day of the Lord is at hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come.",
            "Is not the food cut off before our eyes, joy and gladness from the house of our God?",
            "The seed shrivels under their clods, the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered.",
            "How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.",
            "O Lord, to thee do I cry: for the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame has burned all the trees of the field.",
            "Even beasts of the field cry to Thee: for the water courses are dried up, and the fire has devoured the pastures of the \n\t\t\t\twilderness."

            "a day of darkness and of gloom, a day of clouds and of thick darkness. Like twilight spread over the mountains, a great people and a mighty; there has not been ever the like, nor shall there be any more such after them, to the years of many generations.",
            "A fire devours before them; and behind them blazes a flame: the land is like the garden of ῾Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; and nothing escapes them.",
            "The appearance of them is like the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so do they run.",
            "Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains they leap; like the noise of a flame of fire that devours the stubble, like a strong people set in battle array.",
            "At their presence the peoples are in anguish: all faces are covered with blackness.",
            "They run like mighty men; they climb the wall like men of war; and they march everyone on his ways; and they do not break their ranks:",
            "nor does one thrust another; they walk everyone in his path: and they burst through the weapons; they are not wounded.",
            "They run to and fro in the city; they run upon the wall, they climb up into the houses; they enter in at the windows like a thief.",
            "The earth quakes before them; the heavens tremble: the sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining:",
            "and the Lord utters his voice before his army: for his camp is very great: for \n\t\t\t\t\the who executes his word is strong: for the day of the Lord is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?",
            "Yet even now, says the Lord, turn to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:",
            "and rend your hearts, and not your garments, and turn to the Lord your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and great in love, and repents of evil.",
            "Who knows whether he will not turn and relent, and leave a blessing behind him; a meal offering and a drink offering for the \n\t\t\t\t\tLord your God?",

            "Let the priests, the ministers of the Lord, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O Lord, and give not Thy heritage to reproach, that the nations should rule over them: why should they say among the peoples, Where is their \n\t\t\t\t\tGod?",
            "Then the Lord was zealous for his land, and pitied his people.",

            "Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the Lord will do greater things.",
            "Be not afraid, O beasts of the field: for the pastures of the wilderness shall spring, for the tree bears its fruit, the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength.",
            "Be glad then, you children of Żiyyon, and rejoice in the Lord your God: for he has given you the former rain in due measure, and \n\t\t\t\t\the has brought down for you the rain in the first month, the former rain, and the latter rain.",

            "And you shall know that I am in the midst of Yisra᾽el, and that I am the Lord your God, and there it is none else: and \n\t\t\t\t\tmy people shall never be ashamed."
