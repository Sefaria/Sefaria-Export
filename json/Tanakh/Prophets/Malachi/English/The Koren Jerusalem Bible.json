            "The burden of the word of the Lord to Yisra᾽el by Mal᾽akhi.",
            "I have loved you, says the Lord. Yet you say, In what hast Thou loved us? Was not ῾Esav Ya῾aqov’s brother? says the \n\t\t\t\t\tLord: yet I loved Ya῾aqov,",
            "and I hated ῾Esav, and laid his mountains waste, and gave his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness.",
            "For Edom says, We are made destitute; but we will return and rebuild the desolate places. Thus says the Lord of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall be called, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the \n\t\t\t\t\tLord has indignation for ever.",
            "And your eyes shall see, and you shall say, The Lord is great beyond the border of Yisra᾽el.",
            "A son honours his father, and a servant his master: if then I am a father, where is my honour? and if I am a master, where is my fear? says the \n\t\t\t\t\tLord of hosts to you, O priests, who despise my name. And you say, In what have we despised Thy name?",
            "You offer disgusting bread upon my altar; and you say, In what have we polluted Thee? In that you say, The table of the Lord is contemptible.",
            "And if you offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if you offer a lame or sick animal, is that not evil? offer it now to thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or will he show you favour? says the Lord of hosts.",
            "And now, I pray you, entreat God that he will be gracious to us: this has been your doing: will he show favour to any of you? says the \n\t\t\t\t\tLord of hosts.",
            "O that there were one among you who would shut the doors that you might not kindle fire on my altar for nought! I have no pleasure in you, says the Lord of hosts, nor will I accept an offering at your hand.",
            "For from the rising of the sun until it goes down, my name is great among the nations; and in every place incense is burnt and sacrifices are offered to my name, and a pure offering: for \n\t\t\t\t\tmy name is great among the nations, says the Lord of hosts.",
            "But you profane it, in that you suppose that the table of the Lord is disgusting, and its fruit contemptible to eat.",
            "And you have said, Behold, what a weariness it is! and you have snuffed at it, says the Lord of hosts; and you have brought that which was torn, and the lame, and the sick; so you have brought an offering: should I accept this at your hand? says the \n\t\t\t\t\tLord.",
            "But cursed be the deceiver, who has in his flock a male, and yet vows, and sacrifices to the Lord what is blemished: for I am a great king, says the Lord of hosts, and \n\t\t\t\t\tmy name is feared among the nations."
        ],
        [
            "And now, O you priests, this commandment is for you.",
            "If you will not hear, and if you will not lay it to heart, to give glory to my name, says the Lord of hosts, then I will send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings: indeed, I have cursed them already, because you do not lay it to heart.",
            "Behold, I will rebuke your seed, and spread dung upon your faces, even the dung of your feasts; and you will be taken away with it.",
            "And you shall know that I have sent this commandment to you, that my covenant might be with Levi, says the Lord of hosts.",
            "My covenant was with him for life and peace; and I gave them to him for the fear with which he feared me, and was afraid of my name.",
            "The Tora of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not to be found on his lips: he walked with me in peace and uprightness, and turned many away from iniquity.",
            "For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek Tora at his mouth: for he is a messenger of the Lord of hosts.",
            "But you have turned aside out of the way; you have caused many to stumble in the Tora; you have corrupted the covenant of Levi, says the Lord of hosts.",
            "Therefore I also have made you contemptible and base before all the people, since you have not kept my ways, but have been partial in regard to the Tora.",
            "Have we not all one father? has not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, to profane the covenant of our fathers?",
            "Yehuda has dealt treacherously, and a disgusting thing has been done in Yisra᾽el and in Yerushalayim; for Yehuda has profaned the holiness of the Lord which he loved, and has married the daughter of a strange god.",
            "The Lord will cut off from the man that does this all living offspring from the tents of Ya῾aqov, or any to present an offering to the \n\t\t\t\t\tLord of hosts.",
            "And this is the second thing you do: you cover the altar of the Lord with tears, with weeping, and with sighing, because he will not regard the offering any more, or receive it with good will at your hand.",
            "And you say, Why is this? It is because the Lord has been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously: yet she is thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.",
            "And has he not ordained one flesh, so that one should have a spiritual kin? And what does that one flesh seek? A godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.",
            "For to put away is hateful, says the Lord, the God of Yisra᾽el, and violence will cover his garment, says the \n\t\t\t\t\tLord of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that you do not deal treacherously.",
            "You have wearied the Lord with your words. Yet you say, In what have we wearied him? When you say, Everyone that does evil is good in the sight of the \n\t\t\t\t\tLord, and he delights in them; or, Where is the God of judgment?"

            "Behold, I send my messenger, and he shall clear the way before me: and the Lord, whom you seek, shall suddenly come to \n\t\t\t\t\this temple; and the messenger of the covenant, whom you delight in, behold, he shall come, says the Lord of hosts.",
            "But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appears? for he is like a refiner’s fire, and like the washers’ soap:",
            "and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them like gold and silver, that they may offer to the Lord an offering in righteousness.",
            "Then shall the offering of Yehuda and Yerushalayim be pleasant to the Lord, as in the days of old, and as in former years.",
            "And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those who oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and who turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not \n\t\t\t\t\tme, says the Lord of hosts.",
            "For I am the Lord, I do not change; therefore you sons of Ya῾aqov are not consumed.",
            "From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from my ordinances, and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you, says the \n\t\t\t\t\tLord of hosts. But you have said, With what shall we return?",
            "Will a man rob God? Yet you have robbed me. But you say, In what have we robbed Thee? In tithes and offerings.",
            "You are cursed with a curse: for you have robbed me, this whole nation.",
            "Bring all the tithes into the storehouse, so that there may be food in my house, and put me to the test with that, says the Lord of hosts, if I will not open for you the windows of heaven, and pour out for you blessing immeasurable.",
            "And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; nor shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, says the Lord of hosts.",
            "And all nations shall call you blessed: for you shall be a land of delight, says the Lord of hosts.",
            "Your words have been strong against me, says the Lord. Yet you say, What have we spoken against Thee?",
            "You have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept his charge, and that we have walked mournfully before the \n\t\t\t\t\tLord of hosts?",
            "And now we call the proud happy; they who work wickedness are even built up; even they who tempt God escape.",
            "Then they who feared the Lord spoke to one another: and the Lord hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for those who feared the \n\t\t\t\t\tLord, and took heed of his name.",
            "And they shall be mine, says the Lord of hosts, on that day which I appoint as my particular day; and I will spare them, as a man spares his own son who serves him.",
            "Then you shall return, and see the difference between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serves God and him that does not serve him.",
            "For, behold, that day is coming; it burns like a furnace; and all the arrogant, and all who do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that is coming shall burn them up, says the Lord of hosts, so that it will leave them neither root nor branch.",
            "But to you who fear my name the sun of righteousness shall arise with healing in its wings; and you shall go out, and leap like calves from the stall.",
            "And you shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day that I do this, says the Lord of hosts.",
            "Remember the Tora of Moshe my servant, which I commanded him in Ĥorev for all Yisra᾽el, both statutes and judgments.",
            "Behold, I will send you Eliyya, the prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord:",
            "and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the land with a curse."
