            "Żidqiyyahu was twenty one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Yerushalayim. And his mother’s name was Ĥamutal the daughter of Yirmeyahu of Livna.",
            "And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord, according to all that Yehoyaqim had done.",
            "For through the anger of the Lord it came to pass in Yerushalayim and Yehuda, till he cast them out from his presence. Then Żidqiyyahu rebelled against the king of Bavel.",
            "And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, that Nevukhadreżżar king of Bavel came, he and all his army, against Yerushalayim, and encamped against it, and built a siege work against it round about.",
            "So the city was besieged until the eleventh year of king Żidqiyyahu.",
            "And in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the famine was severe in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.",
            "Then the city was breached, and all the men of war fled, and went out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king’s garden; (now the Kasdim were by the city round about:) and they went by the way of the plain.",
            "But the army of the Kasdim pursued after the king, and overtook Żidqiyyahu in the plains of Yereĥo; and all his army was scattered from him.",
            "Then they took the king, and carried him up to the king of Bavel to Rivla in the land of Ĥamat; where he gave judgment upon him.",
            "And the king of Bavel slew the sons of Żidqiyyahu before his eyes: he slew also all the princes of Yehuda in Rivla.",
            "Then he put out the eyes of Żidqiyyahu; and the king of Bavel bound him in fetters, and carried him to Bavel, and put him in prison till the day of his death.",
            "Now in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of Nevukhadreżżar king of Bavel, Nevuzar᾽adan, captain of the guard, who served the king of Bavel, came to Yerushalayim.",
            "And he burned the house of the Lord, and the king’s house; and all the houses of Yerushalayim, and every great house he burned with fire:",
            "and all the army of the Kasdim, that were with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls of Yerushalayim round about.",
            "Then Nevuzar᾽adan the captain of the guard carried away into exile certain of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that remained in the city, and the deserts who had deserted to the king of Bavel, and the rest of the multitude.",
            "But Nevuzar᾽adan the captain of the guard left certain of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for fieldworkers.",
            "Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the Lord, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the Lord, the Kasdim broke, and carried all the brass of them to Bavel.",
            "The pans also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered, they took away.",
            "And the bowls, and the firepans, and the basins, and the pans, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the bowls both that which was of gold in gold, and that which was of silver in silver, the captain of the guard took away.",
            "The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brass bulls that were under the bases, which king Shelomo had made in the house of the Lord: the brass of all these vessels was unweighed.",
            "And as for the pillars, the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a thread of twelve cubits did compass it; and its thickness was four fingers: it was hollow.",
            "And a capital of brass was upon it; and the height of one capital was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the capitals round about, all of brass. The second pillar also and the pomegranates were like these.",
            "And there were ninety six pomegranates on a side; and all the pomegranates upon the network were a hundred round about.",
            "And the captain of the guard took Seraya the chief priest, and Żefanya the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:",
            "he also took out of the city an officer, who had the charge of the men of war; and seven of those men who were near the king’s person, who were found in the city; and the scribe of the chief of the army, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city.",
            "So Nevuzar᾽adan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Bavel to Rivla.",
            "And the king of Bavel smote them, and put them to death in Rivla in the land of Ĥamat. Thus Yehuda was exiled out of his own land.",
            "This is the number of the people whom Nevukhadreżżar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand and twenty three men of Yehuda:",
            "in the eighteenth year of Nevukhadreżżar he carried away from Yerushalayim eight hundred and thirty two persons:",
            "in the twenty third year of Nevukhadreżżar, Nevuzar᾽adan the captain of the guard carried away into exile of the men of Yehuda seven hundred and forty five persons: all the persons were four thousand and six hundred.",
            "And it came to pass in the thirty seventh year of the exile of Yehoyakhin king of Yehuda, in the twelfth month, on the twenty fifth day of the month, that Evil-merodakh king of Bavel in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Yehoyakhin king of Yehuda, and brought him out of prison,",
            "and spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Bavel,",
            "and changed his prison garments: and he did continually eat bread before him all the days of his life.",
            "And for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him by the king of Bavel, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life."
