            "And the children of Binyamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the people, and kill, as on the other occasions, in the highways, of which one goes up to Bet-el, and the other to Giv῾a in the field, killing about thirty men of Yisra᾽el.",
            "And the children of Binyamin said, They are beaten before us, as at the first. But the children of Yisra᾽el said, Let us flee, and draw them from the city onto the highways.",
            "And all the men of Yisra᾽el rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array at Ba῾al-tamar: and the liers in wait of Yisra᾽el rushed out of their places, out of Ma῾are-geva.",
            "And there came against Giv῾a ten thousand chosen men out of all Yisra᾽el, and the battle was hard: but they knew not that disaster was close upon them.",
            "And the Lord smote Binyamin before Yisra᾽el: and the children of Yisra᾽el destroyed of Binyamin that day twenty five thousand one hundred men: all these drew the sword.",
            "So the children of Binyamin saw that they were beaten: for the men of Yisra᾽el gave place to Binyamin, because they trusted to the liers in wait which they had set beside Giv῾a.",
            "And the liers in wait hastened, and rushed upon Giv῾a; and the liers in wait moved out, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword.",
            "Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Yisra᾽el and the liers in wait, that they should make a great column of smoke rise up out of the city.",
            "And when the men of Yisra᾽el retired in the battle, and Binyamin began to smite and kill the men of Yisra᾽el about thirty persons: (for they said, Surely they are beaten before us, as in the first battle)",
            "then the beacon began to arise up out of the city, a pillar of smoke, and Binyamin looked behind them and behold, the whole city was going up to heaven in flames.",
            "And when the men of Yisra᾽el turned again, the men of Binyamin were amazed: for they saw that disaster was come upon them.",
            "Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Yisra᾽el in the direction of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and those who came out of the cities destroyed them in the midst of them.",
            "Thus they enclosed Binyamin round about, and chased them, and trod them down with ease over against Giv῾a toward the sunrising.",
            "And there fell of Binyamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valour.",
            "And they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them as far as Gid῾om, and slew two thousand men of them.",
            "So that all who fell that day of Binyamin were twenty five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valour.",
            "But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness to the rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon for four months.",
            "And the men of Yisra᾽el turned back upon the children of Binyamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, both the men of every city, and beasts, and all that came to hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to."
