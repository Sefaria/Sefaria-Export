            "Jonah, however, started out to flee to Tarshish from G<small>OD</small>’s service. He went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish. He paid the fare and went aboard to sail with the others to Tarshish, away from G<small>OD</small>’s service.",
            "But G<small>OD</small> cast a mighty wind upon the sea, and such a great tempest came upon the sea that the ship was in danger of breaking up. ",
            "In their fright, the sailors cried out, each to his own god; and they flung the ship’s cargo overboard to make it lighter for them. Jonah, meanwhile, had gone down into the hold of the vessel where he lay down and fell asleep. ",
            "The captain went over to him and cried out, “How can you be sleeping so soundly! Up, call upon your god! Perhaps the god will be kind to us and we will not perish.”",

            "He answered, “Heave me overboard, and the sea will calm down for you; for I know that this terrible storm came upon you on my account.” ",
            "Nevertheless, the men rowed hard to regain the shore, but they could not, for the sea was growing more and more stormy about them. ",
            "Then they cried out to G<small>OD</small>: “Oh, please, E<small>TERNAL</small> One, do not let us perish on account of this man’s life. Do not hold us guilty of killing an innocent person! For You, O E<small>TERNAL</small> One, by Your will, have brought this about.” ",
