            "The sun also ariseth, And the sun goeth down, And hasteth to his place where he ariseth.",
            "The wind goeth toward the south, And turneth about unto the north; It turneth about continually in its circuit, And the wind returneth again to its circuits.",
            "All the rivers run into the sea, Yet the sea is not full; Unto the place whither the rivers go, Thither they go again.",
            "All things toil to weariness; Man cannot utter it, The eye is not satisfied with seeing, Nor the ear filled with hearing.",
            "That which hath been is that which shall be, And that which hath been done is that which shall be done; And there is nothing new under the sun.",
            "Is there a thing whereof it is said: ‘See, this is new’?—it hath been already, in the ages which were before us.",
            "There is no remembrance of them of former times; neither shall there be any remembrance of them of latter times that are to come, among those that shall come after.",
            "I Koheleth have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.",
            "And I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven; it is a sore task that God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith.",

            "And I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly—I perceived that this also was a striving after wind.",

            "I searched in my heart how to pamper my flesh with wine, and, my heart conducting itself with wisdom, how yet to lay hold on folly, till I might see which it was best for the sons of men that they should do under the heaven the few days of their life.",
            "I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards;",
            "I made me gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit;",
            "I made me pools of water, to water therefrom the wood springing up with trees;",

            "Therefore I turned about to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labour wherein I had laboured under the sun.",
            "For there is a man whose labour is with wisdom, and with knowledge, and with skill; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.",
            "For what hath a man of all his labour, and of the striving of his heart, wherein he laboureth under the sun?",
            "For all his days are pains, and his occupation vexation; yea, even in the night his heart taketh not rest. This also is vanity.",

            "For who will eat, or who will enjoy, if not I?",
            "For to the man that is good in His sight He giveth wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner He giveth the task, to gather and to heap up, that he may leave to him that is good in the sight of God. This also is vanity and a striving after wind."
