            "All things are full of weariness; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.",
            "That which has been, it is that which shall be; and that which has been done is that which shall be done: and there is nothing new under the sun.",
            "Is there a thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new; but it has already been in the ages before us.",
            "There is no remembrance of former things; nor will there be any remembrance of things that are to come among those who shall come after.",
            "I Qohelet was king over Yisra᾽el in Yerushalayim.",
            "And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under the heaven: it is a sore task that God has given to the sons of man to be exercised with.",

            "And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also was a striving after wind.",

            "I made great works for myself; I built houses; I planted vineyards:",
            "I made gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits:",
            "I made pools of water, from which to water a forest of growing trees:",

            "Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.",
