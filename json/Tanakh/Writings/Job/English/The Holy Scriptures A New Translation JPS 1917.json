            "And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.",
            "His possessions also were seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east.",
            "And his sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one upon his day; and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.",
            "And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt-offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said: ‘It may be that my sons have sinned, and blasphemed God in their hearts.’ Thus did Job continually.",
            "Now it fell upon a day, that the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.",

            "Then Satan answered the LORD, and said: ‘Doth Job fear God for nought?",
            "Hast not Thou made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath, on every side? Thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions are increased in the land.",
            "But put forth Thy hand now, and touch all that he hath, surely he will blaspheme Thee to Thy face.’",
            "And the LORD said unto Satan: ‘Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thy hand.’ So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.",
            "And it fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house,",
            "that there came a messenger unto Job, and said: ‘The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them;",
            "and the Sabeans made a raid, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.’",
            "While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said: ‘A fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.’",
            "While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said: ‘The Chaldeans set themselves in three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have taken them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.’",
            "While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said: ‘Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house;",

            "And the LORD said unto Satan: ‘Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a whole-hearted and an upright man, one that feareth God, and shunneth evil? and he still holdeth fast his integrity, although thou didst move Me against him, to destroy him without cause.’",
            "And Satan answered the LORD, and said: ‘Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.",
            "But put forth Thy hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, surely he will blaspheme Thee to Thy face.’",
            "And the LORD said unto Satan: ‘Behold, he is in thy hand; only spare his life.’",
            "So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot even unto his crown.",
