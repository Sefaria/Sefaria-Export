            "There was a man in the land of ῾Uż, whose name was Iyyov, and that man was perfect and upright, and one who feared God, and turned away from evil.",
            "And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.",
            "His possessions also were seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and very many servants; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.",
            "And his sons used to go and feast in the house of each one on his day; and they used to send and call for their three sisters to eat and drink with them.",
            "And when the days of their feasting were gone about, Iyyov sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Iyyov said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and despised God in their hearts. Thus Iyyov did continually.",
            "Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and the adversary came also among them.",
            "And the Lord said to the adversary, From where dost thou come? Then the adversary answered the Lord, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.",
            "And the Lord said to the adversary, Hast thou considered my servant Iyyov, that there is none like him on earth, a perfect and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil?",
            "Then the adversary answered the Lord, and said, Does Iyyov fear God for nought?",
            "Hast Thou not made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he has on every side? Thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.",
            "But now put forth Thy hand, and touch all that he has, and he will curse Thee to Thy face.",
            "And the Lord said to the adversary, Behold, all that he has is in thy power; only upon himself do not put forth thy hand. So the adversary went out from the presence of the Lord.",
            "Now there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house:",
            "and there came a messenger to Iyyov, and said, The oxen were ploughing, and the asses were feeding beside them:",
            "and men of Sheva fell upon them, and took them away; and slew the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.",
            "While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God has fallen from heaven, and has burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.",
            "While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Kasdim formed three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, and have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.",
            "While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house:",

            "and said, Naked I came out of my mother’s womb, and naked I shall return there: the Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.",

            "And the Lord said to the adversary, Hast thou considered my servant Iyyov, that there is none like him on earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that fears God and turns away from evil? and still he holds fast to his integrity, although thou didst move me against him, to destroy him without cause.",
            "And the adversary answered the Lord, and said, Skin covers skin! for all that a man has he will give for his life.",
            "But put forth thy hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse Thee to Thy face.",
            "And the Lord said to the adversary, Behold, he is in thy hand; but save his life.",
            "So the adversary went forth from the presence of the Lord, and smote Iyyov with vile sores from the sole of his foot to his crown.",
