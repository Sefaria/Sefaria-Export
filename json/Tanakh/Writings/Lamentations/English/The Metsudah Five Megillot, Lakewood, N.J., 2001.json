            "How can it be that she sits in isolation the city teeming with people has become like a widow? Immense among nations, noble among provinces—she has become a payer of tribute.",
            "She weeps bitterly in the night, her tear on her cheek. No one consoles her, among all her lovers. All of her friends have betrayed her, they have become her enemies.",
            "Yehudah was exiled because of torment and excessive toil. [Even] when she dwelt among the nations, she found no rest. All her pursuers overtook her between the barriers.",
            "The roads of <i>Tzion</i> grieve, for lack of festival visitors. All her gateways are in ruins, her <i>Kohanim</i> groan, her maidens grieve; and she is embittered.",
            "Her oppressors have become elevated, her enemies are at ease. For Adonoy has brought her grief for her excessive iniquity. Her young were taken captive before the oppressors.",
            "Gone from the city of <i>Tzion,</i> is all her splendor her nobles have become like harts who could find no pasture, plodding powerlessly before the pursuer.",
            "Yerusholayim, remembered the days of her [ruin] [which brought her] poverty and lamenting; [and] all her treasures she had in early times. When her people fell into the hands of the oppressors and no one came to her aid, her enemies watched her, laughing derisively when she was curbed (from celebrating her holidays).",
            "Jerusalem has grievously sinned, and, therefore, has become a wanderer. All those who glorified her scorn her, for they have seen her degradation. She, too, is sorrowful, and has turned backward, (humiliated and ashamed).",
            "Her defilement is at her hem, she was not mindful of her end—so she plummeted astonishingly, with no one to console her. Adonoy look at my suffering, for the enemy has gone to excess.",
            "The oppressor extended his hand over all her treasures, as she witnessed peoples entering her Sanctuary concerning whom You commanded, “Let them not enter your community.”",
            "All her people are groaning, searching for bread. They have given away their treasures for food to keep their souls intact. Look, Adonoy, and take notice how I have become degraded.",
            "May this not happen to you, all who stray from the path. Notice, see if there is such agony like my agony, that has been visited upon me when Adonoy brought me to grief on the day He vented His wrath.",
            "From a lofty place He hurled fire into my bones, crushing it. He spread a net for my feet, thrust me back, placed me in ruins, [so that I] suffer throughout the day.",
            "The yoke of my iniquities is recorded in His hand. They have become interwoven, and have encumbered my neck. He has caused my strength to fail. God has placed me in the hands of those whom I cannot withstand.",
            "God has trampled all my stalwarts in my midst, He has proclaimed a gathering against me to crush my young men. [As with] a wine press, God has trodden the maidens of the province of Yehudah.",
            "For these I weep, my eyes [lit. my eye, my eye] gush water, for remote from me is a consoler who can calm my soul. My sons are devastated, for the enemy has conquered.",
            "<i>Tzion</i> spreads her arms, there is no one to console her. Adonoy has commanded, concerning Yaakov, that his oppressors surround him. Jerusalem has become despicable among them.",
            "Adonoy is just, for it is I who rejected His word. Listen here, all you nations, look at my torment; my maidens and my young men have gone into captivity.",
            "I cried out to those who appeared to love me, but they deceived me. My <i>kohanim</i> and elders expired in the city while they searched for food for themselves, to sustain their souls.",
            "Adonoy, see how oppressed I am? My gut has shriveled, my heart is twisting inside me, because of my rebelliousness. Outside, the sword brings bereavement, within, it is like death.",
            "They have heard how I groan, and no one consoles me; all my enemies have heard of my calamity, and rejoiced, for it is Your doing. Bring the day that You proclaimed, and let them resemble me.",
            "Let all their evil come before You, and do, to them, what You have done to me for all my iniquity, for I groan much, and my heart aches."

            "God swallowed up mercilessly every residence of Ya’akov. He smashed, in His fury, the fortifications of the province of Yehudah, razing them to the ground. He desecrated the kingdom and its princes.",
            "He tore down, in his wrath, all the power [lit. horn] of Israel. He withheld His right arm in the face of the enemy. He ignited Ya’akov like a blazing flame which consumes on every side.",
            "He arched His bow like an enemy, set His right arm like an oppressor, and slew everyone that was a delight to behold. In the tent of the city of <i>Tzion</i> He poured His fury like fire.",

            "He cut down His dwelling place like a garden, He destroyed His place of communion, Adonoy caused to be forgotten in <i>Tzion</i> the Festivals and Shabbos. He scorned, in the fury of His wrath, the king and the <i>kohein.</i>",
            "God abandoned His altar, nullified His Sanctuary, delivered, into the enemy’s hand, the walls of its palaces. They sounded a shout, in the House of Adonoy, like that of a festival day.",

            "What testimony can I offer you, to what can I compare you, city of Jerusalem? to what can I liken you to console you, O maiden, city of <i>Tzion?</i> For your disintegration is as immense as the sea—who can heal you?",
            "Your prophets envisioned, for you, falsehood and stupidity, and did not expose your transgressions, to bring you back from your waywardness. They envisioned, for you, prophecies of falsehood and deception.",
            "They clap their hands over you—all those who travel along the way; they hiss and shake their heads over the city of Jerusalem. Is this the city of which it was said, “The perfection of beauty, delight of all the earth?”",
            "They opened their mouths wide concerning you—all your enemies—they whistled, gnashed their teeth, and exclaimed, “We swallowed them up? This is precisely the day we hoped for! We’ve experienced it! We’ve seen it!”",
            "God acted as planned. He fulfilled His word as decreed in the days of old—He destroyed without pity He gave joy to the enemy concerning you, and enhanced the power of your oppressors.",
            "Their hearts cried out to God. O Rampart of the city of <i>Tzion,</i> pour forth a river of tears day and night. Allow yourself no respite, nor the pupil of your eye silence.",
            "Rise, cry in the night, when the watches begin, pour your heart out, like water, before God. Lift up your hands to Him for the souls of your infants, faint from starvation at the head of every street.",
            "Adonoy, look, notice upon whom you have visited this, when women devour their own offspring, infants who were lovingly attended. When in the Sanctuary of God, was murdered—a <i>kohein</i> and prophet.",
            "On the ground, in the streets they lie, young and old. My maidens and youths have fallen by the sword. You killed, on the day of Your wrath, you slaughtered mercilessly.",
            "You summoned, as if to a festive day, my surrounding neighbors. There was no one, on the day of Adonoy’s wrath, who found refuge or survived. Those whom I attended lovingly and reared, my enemy has annihilated."
