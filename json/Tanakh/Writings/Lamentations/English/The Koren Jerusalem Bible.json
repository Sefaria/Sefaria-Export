            "How does the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how is she become like a widow! she that was great among the nations, and princess among the provinces, how is she become a vassal!",
            "She weeps sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks: among all her lovers she has none to comfort her: all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they have become her enemies.",
            "Yehuda is gone into exile because of affliction, and because of great servitude: she dwells among the nations, she finds no rest: all her persecutors overtook her within the straits.",
            "The ways of Żiyyon do mourn, because none come to the solemn assembly: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she is in bitterness.",
            "Her adversaries have become the chief, her enemies prosper; for the Lord has afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her infants are gone into captivity before the enemy.",
            "And from the daughter of Żiyyon all her splendour is departed: her princes are become like harts that find no pasture, and they are gone without strength before the pursuer.",
            "Yerushalayim remembers in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the adversaries saw her, and gloated at her destruction.",
            "Yerushalayim has grievously sinned; therefore she is become loathsome: all that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: she herself also sighs, and turns backward.",
            "Her filthiness was in her skirts; she took no thought of her last end; therefore she came down astonishingly: she has no comforter. O Lord, behold my affliction: for the enemy has magnified himself.",
            "The adversary has spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things: for she has seen that heathen nations invade her sanctuary, those whom Thou didst forbid to enter into Thy congregation.",
            "All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their pleasant things for food to relieve the soul: see, O Lord, and consider; how abject I am become.",
            "Is it nothing to you, all you that pass by? behold, and see if there is any pain like my pain, which is done to me, with which the Lord has afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger.",
            "From above he has sent fire into my bones, and it prevails against them: he has spread a net for my feet, he has turned me back: he has made me desolate and faint all the day.",
            "The yoke of my transgressions is fastened on by his hand: they are knit together, and come up upon my neck: he has made my strength to fall, the Lord has delivered me into the hands of those against whom I am not able to rise up.",
            "The Lord has spurned all my mighty men in the midst of me: he has called an assembly against me to crush my young men: the Lord has trodden the virgin, the daughter of Yehuda, as in a winepress.",
            "For these things I weep; my eye, my eye runs down with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy has prevailed.",
            "Żiyyon spreads out her hands, and there is none to comfort her: the Lord has commanded against Ya῾aqov, adversaries round about him: Yerushalayim is like a menstruous woman among them.",
            "The Lord is righteous; for I have rebelled against his word: hear, I pray you, all the peoples, and behold my pain: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.",
            "I called for my lovers, but they deceived me: my priests and my elders perished in the city, while they sought food for themselves to relieve their souls.",
            "Behold, O Lord; for I am in distress: my bowels are troubled; my heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: abroad the sword bereaves, at home it is like death.",
            "They have heard that I sigh: there is none to comfort me: all my enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that Thou hast done it: Thou wilt bring the day that Thou hast called, and they shall be like me.",
            "Let all their wickedness come before Thee; and do to them, as Thou hast done to me for all my transgressions: for my sighs are many, and my heart is faint."

            "How has the Lord covered the daughter of Żiyyon with a cloud in his anger, and cast down from heaven to earth the beauty of Yisra᾽el, and remembered not his footstool in the day of  his anger!",
            "The Lord has swallowed up without pity all the habitations of Ya῾aqov: he has thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Yehuda; he has brought them down to the ground: he has profaned the kingdom and its princes.",
            "He has cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of Yisra᾽el: he has drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he has burned against Ya῾aqov like a flaming fire, which devours round about.",
            "He has bent his bow like an enemy: with his right hand set like an adversary, he has slain all that were pleasant to the eye: in the tent of the daughter of Żiyyon, he has poured out his fury like fire.",
            "The Lord was like an enemy: he has swallowed up Yisra᾽el, he has swallowed up all her palaces: he has destroyed his strongholds, and has increased in the daughter of Yehuda mourning and lamentation.",
            "And he has stripped his tabernacle, as if it were a garden: he has destroyed his place of assembly: the Lord has caused the appointed seasons and sabbaths to be forgotten in Żiyyon, and has spurned in the indignation of his anger both king and priest.",
            "The Lord has cast off his altar, he has abhorred his sanctuary, he has given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of the Lord, as in the day of a solemn assembly.",
            "The Lord has purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Żiyyon: he has stretched out a line, he has not withdrawn his hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; they languish together.",
            "Her gates are sunk into the ground; he has destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the nations: there is no Tora; her prophets also find no vision from the Lord.",

            "Thy prophets have seen for thee vain and foolish visions: and they have not exposed thy iniquity, to restore thy captivity; but have prophesied for thee burdens of falsehood and deceit.",
            "All that pass by clap their hands at thee; they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Yerushalayim, saying, Is this the city that men call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?",
            "All thy enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed her up: certainly this is the day that we have looked for; we have found it, we have seen it.",
            "The Lord has done that which he devised; he has fulfilled his word that he commanded in the days of old: he has thrown down without pity: and he has caused the enemy to rejoice over thee, he has raised up the horn of thy adversaries.",
            "Their heart cried to the Lord. O wall of the daughter of Żiyyon, let tears run down like a river day and night: give thyself no rest; let not the apple of thy eye cease.",
            "Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour out thy heart like water before the face of the Lord: lift up thy hands towards him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger at the head of every street.",
            "Behold, O Lord, and consider to whom Thou hast done this. Shall the women eat their fruit, their cherished babes? shall priest and prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?",
            "Young and old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; Thou hast slain them in the day of Thy anger; Thou hast killed, and not pitied.",
            "Thou hast called as in the day of a solemn assembly, my terrors round about, so that in the day of the Lord’s anger none escaped or remained: those that I have cherished and brought up my enemy has consumed."
