            "And the Lord gave Yehoyaqim king of Yehuda into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shin῾ar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.",
            "And the king spoke to Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring some of the children of Yisra᾽el and of the king’s seed, and of the nobles;",
            "youths in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and discerning in knowledge, and perceptive in understanding, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king’s palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Kasdim.",
            "And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king’s food and of the wine which he drank; that they should be thus reared for three years, and at the end of that time, they might stand before the king.",
            "Now among these were of the children of Yehuda: Daniyyel, Ĥananya, Misha᾽el, and ῾Azarya:",
            "to whom the chief of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave to Daniyyel the name of Belteshażżar; and to Ĥananya, of Shadrakh; and to Misha᾽el, of Meshakh; and to ῾Azarya, of ῾Aved-nego.",
            "But Daniyyel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king’s food, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the chief of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.",
            "Now God had brought Daniyyel into grace and compassion with the chief of the eunuchs.",
            "And the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniyyel, I fear my lord the king, who has appointed your food and your drink: for why should he see you looking more woebegone than other youths of your age? for then you should endanger my head to the king.",
            "Then Daniyyel said to the steward whom the chief of the eunuchs has set over Daniyyel, Ĥananya, Misha᾽el, and ῾Azarya,",
            "Put thy servants to the proof I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us vegetables to eat, and water to drink.",
            "Then let our appearances, and the appearances of the youths that eat of the king’s food be observed by you; and as thou seest, so deal with thy servants.",
            "So he consented to them in this matter, and put them to the proof for ten days.",
            "And at the end of ten days they appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the youths who did eat the portion of the king’s fare.",
            "So the steward took away the food and the wine that they should have drunk; and gave them vegetables.",
            "As for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniyyel had understanding in all visions and dreams.",
            "Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the chief of the eunuchs brought them in before Nevukhadneżżar.",

            "But if you declare the dream, and its meaning, you shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore declare to me the dream, and its meaning.",

            "But if you will not make known to me the dream, there is but one law for you: for you have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that you can declare its interpretation to me.",
            "The Kasdians answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth who can declare the king’s matter: for no king, lord, nor ruler, has asked such things of any magician, or conjurer, or Kasdian.",

            "Then Daniyyel went to his house, and made the thing known to Ĥananya, Misha᾽el, and ῾Azarya, his companions:",
            "that they would beg mercy from the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniyyel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Bavel.",
            "Then was the secret revealed to Daniyyel in a night vision. So Daniyyel blessed the God of heaven.",
            "Daniyyel spoke and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:",
            "and he changes the times and the seasons: he removes kings, and sets up kings: he gives wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to those who have understanding:",
            "he reveals the deep and secret things: he knows what is in the darkness, and the light dwells with him.",
            "I thank Thee, O Thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known to me now what we desired of Thee: for Thou hast now made known to us the king’s matter.",
            "Therefore Daniyyel went in to Aryokh, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Bavel: he went and said thus to him; Do not destroy the wise men of Bavel: bring me in before the king, and I will show the king the interpretation.",
            "Then Aryokh brought in Daniyyel before the king in haste, and said thus to him, I have found a man of the exiles of Yehuda, who will make known to the king the interpretation.",
            "The king answered and said to Daniyyel, whose name was Belteshażżar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and its meaning?",

            "but there is a God in heaven who reveals secret things, and makes known to the king Nevukhadneżżar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;",

            "Thou, O king, didst see, and behold a great image. This image, which was mighty, and whose brightness was surpassing stood before thee; and its form was terrible.",
            "This image’s head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass,",
            "its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay.",
            "As thou didst look, a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon its feet which were of iron and clay, and broke them to pieces.",
            "Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.",
            "This is the dream; and we will state its meaning before the king.",

            "And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.",
            "And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: because iron breaks to pieces and subdues all things: and like iron that shatters, so shall it shatter and crush all these other.",
            "And whereas thou didst see the feet and toes, partly of potters’ clay, and partly of iron, so it shall be a divided kingdom; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, just as thou didst see the iron mixed with miry clay.",
            "And as the toes of the feet were partly of iron, and partly of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly brittle.",
            "And whereas thou didst see iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, just as iron does not mix with clay.",
            "And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to another people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever:",
            "just as thou didst see that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold. The great God has made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the meaning of it sure.",
