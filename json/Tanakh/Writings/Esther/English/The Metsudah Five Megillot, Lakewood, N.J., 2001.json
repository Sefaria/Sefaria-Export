            "In those days, when king Achashverosh had established himself on his imperial throne, in the capital city of Shushan.",
            "In the third year of his reign, he tendered a feast for all his ministers and servants, the forces of Persia and Media, the nobles and the colonial ministers, in his presence.",
            "Where he exhibited the affluence and eminence of his kingdom, the glory and splendor of his magnificence; for many days—one hundred and eighty days.",
            "At the completion of these days, the king tendered, for all the people present in the capital city of Shushan, from the greatest to the least significant, a feast for seven days, on the grounds of the garden in the royal orchard.",
            "[There were] pure white drapes, fine woolen cushions, bluish emerald <i>techeiles</i> wool, brocaded with strands of linen and mauve, woolen <i>argaman</i> threads, over silver columns and marble pillars; gold and silver couches on a floor inlaid with rare gems and marble, set in parallel circular patterns.",
            "As for drinking; golden utensils, other sundry vessels, and plenty of royal wine, with majestic largesse.",
            "The drinking was proper, with no coercion; for the king had so basically instructed all his palace officials—to satisfy each individual’s desire.",
            "Queen Vashti, as well, tendered a feast for women, at king Achashverosh’s palace.",
            "On the seventh day, when the king was exhilarated by drink, he instructed Mehuman, Bizesa, Charvona, Bigsa, Avagsa, Zeisar, and Charkas, the seven servants who attended King Achashverosh’s person—",
            "to present Queen Vashti before the king [clad] in the royal crown, to flaunt her beauty before the nations and the ministers, for she was of beautiful appearance.",
            "Queen Vashti refused to attend as ordered by the king through the servants—and the king was extremely angered, his fury consumed him.",
            "The king consulted the sages who were well versed in the affairs of the times, for the king would thus place matters before all who were versed in procedural and legal concerns.",
            "Most intimately associated with him, were Karshena, Sheisar, Admasa, Sarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memuchan, the seven ministers of Persia and Media who were in personal contact with the king, and who occupied the highest seats of power in the kingdom.",
            "Concerning the proper procedure to follow with Queen Vashti, since she did not do as directed by King Achashverosh through the servants.",
            "Memuchan spoke before the king and the ministers: “It is not only his majesty that Vashti has aggrieved, but all the ministers and all the peoples in all of King Achashverosh’s colonies.",
            "For the affair of the queen will extend to all women, so that they will disparage their husbands, saying, ‘King Achashverosh commanded that Queen Vashti be brought before him, but she never came!’",
            "This very day, the noblewomen in Persia and Media will say—those who have heard about the affair of the queen shall report it to the king’s ministers causing enormous disparagement and rage!",
            "If his majesty deems it proper, let him issue a royal edict, to be recorded in the bylaws of Persia and Media—never to be revoked—that Vashti must never again appear before King Achashverosh; and let his majesty bestow her regency on a companion of hers who is superior to her.",
            "Now when the news of his majesty’s writ and its implementation reverberates throughout the kingdom—vast as it is—then all the wives will honor their husbands, from the greatest to the least significant.”",
            "The advice was viewed favorably by the king and his ministers, and the king acted on Memuchan’s recommendation.",
            "He dispatched scrolls to all of the king’s colonies—to each and every colony in its own script, and each and every people in their own language—instructing that every husband be dominant in his home, and that his people’s language be the one spoken."

            "The king’s youthful valets suggested: “Let them seek, for his majesty, young maidens of beautiful appearance.",
            "And let his majesty appoint officials in all the colonies of his kingdom, who shall assemble all the young maidens of beautiful appearance at the capital city of Shushan, in the harem residence, in the custody of his majesty’s enunuch Heige, the harem overseer, and let them be supplied with their cosmetics.",
            "And the young woman whom his majesty views with approval shall reign in place of Vashti.” This suggestion was viewed favorably by the king, and he implemented it.",
            "There was a Yehudite man in the capital city of Shushan. His name: Mordechai, son of Yair, son of Shim’i, son of Kish, a Binyaminite man.",
            "Who was exiled from Jerusalem with the captives exiled with Yechaniah, king of Yehudah, driven into exile by Nevuchadnezzar, king of Babylon.",
            "He was the foster parent of Hadassah—this was his cousin Esther—as she had neither father nor mother. The young woman was beautiful in form and appearance, and when her father and mother died, Mordechai adopted her as a daughter.",
            "Now it happened, when the king’s edict, his bylaw, was made public, and a large number of young women were gathered at the capital city of Shushan, in the custody of Heigai, that Esther was brought to the royal palace, in the custody of Heigai, the harem overseer.",
            "He viewed the young woman favorably, and she gained his benevolence. He eagerly delivered her cosmetics and her clothing allowance to her also the seven special maidservants assigned to her from the royal household staff. He favored her and her maidservants with preferential treatment at the harem residence.",
            "Esther did not reveal [the identity of] her people or her heritage, since Mordechai had instructed her not to reveal it.",
            "Each and every day, Mordechai would pace before the courtyard of the harem residence, to apprise himself of Esther’s welfare, and of what would be done with her.",
            "When the time arrived for each of the young women to be admitted to King Achashverosh, at the end of her participation in the course for women which lasted twelve months—for they were annointed, during their cosmetic treatment, with the following: six months with balm of myrrh, and six months with aromatic ointments and other womanly cosmetics.",
            "This is how the young woman would be admitted to the king: whatever she requested would be provided to accompany her from the harem residence to the royal palace.",
            "She would arrive in the evening and return in the morning, to a second harem residence, in the custody of Sha’ashgaz, the king’s eunuch, overseer of the concubines. She would no longer be admitted to the king unless the king desired her, when she would be summoned by name.",
            "When the time arrived for Esther, the daughter of Avichayil, the uncle of Mordechai, whom he had adopted as a daughter, to be admitted to the king, she requested nothing save what was suggested by Heigai, the king’s eunuch, the harem overseer. Esther was regarded with favor by everyone who beheld her.",
            "Esther was brought to King Achashverosh, into his royal palace, in the tenth month—that is, the month of Teves—during the seventh year of his reign.",
            "The king loved Esther more than all the women, she gained his favor and his benevolence more than all the maidens, so he placed the royal crown upon her head, and coronated her in place of Vashti.",
            "The king tendered a magnificent feast for all of his ministers and servants—the feast of Esther. He waived the colonial taxes, and lavished gifts with majestic largesse.",
            "When the maidens were gathered a second time, Mordechai sat at the gateway to the king.",
            "Esther would not reveal [the identity of] her heritage or her people, just as Mordechai had directed her. Esther followed Mordechai’s bidding, just as she did when she was reared by him.",
            "In those days, when Mordechai sat at the gateway to the king, Bigsan and Seresh became enraged—they were two of the king’s stewards, of the guardians of the entrance [to his dwelling]—and sought to assault King Achashverosh.",
            "The matter was apprehended by Mordechai, who reported it to Queen Esther. Esther related it to the king in Mordechai’s name.",
            "The matter was investigated and verified, and both were hung from a gallows. This was inscribed in the book of archives in the presence of the king."

            "After these events, King Achashverosh conferred eminence on Haman, the son of Hamdasa, the Agagite, and exalted him, placing his seat of office above all of his fellow ministers.",
            "And all of the king’s servants who were at the gateway to the king kneeled and prostrated themselves before Haman, for the king had so commanded concerning him—but Mordechai would neither kneel nor prostrate himself.",
            "Said the king’s servants who were at the gateway of the king to Mordechai, “Why are you flouting the king’s command?”",
            "It happened that, when they spoke to him daily, and he paid them no heed, they informed Haman, to see whether Mordechai’s avowal would be sustained—for he told them that he was a Yehudi.",
            "Haman then observed that Mordechai neither kneeled nor prostrated himself before him, and Haman was totally incensed.",
            "But it was demeaning, in his view, to strike at Mordechai alone, for he was informed of [the identity of] Mordechai’s people. Haman sought to destroy all the Yehudim throughout Achashverosh’s realm—Mordechai’s people.",
            "In the first month, which is the month of Nisan, during King Achashverosh’s twelfth year, a “pur”, meaning “lot”, was cast in the presence of Haman, for a specific day, and, specifically, the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar.",
            "Haman then said to King Achashverosh: “There exists a particular people, far-flung, widespread among the peoples in all the colonies of your realm. Their customs differ from those of all peoples, and they do not abide by his majesty’s bylaws; his majesty has nothing to gain by tolerating them.",
            "If his majesty deems it proper, let it be inscribed that they are to be exterminated. And I shall weigh out ten thousand silver kikars under the auspices of the executive staff, to be deposited in the royal coffers.”",
            "The king removed his ring from his hand, and presented it to Haman the son of Hamdasa the Agagite, oppressor of the Yehudim.",
            "And the king said to Haman, “Keep the silver and do as you wish with the[se] people.”",
            "The royal scribes were then summoned, during the first month, on the thirteenth day of the month, and transcripts were made of all of Haman’s directives, to the imperial envoys, to the governors of each of the colonies, and to the ministers of each people, each and every colony in its own script, each and every people in its own language; it was written in King Achashverosh’s name and sealed with the royal ring.",
            "So that scrolls would be dispatched, carried by couriers, to all of the king’s colonies; to devastate, slaughter, and annihilate all the Yehudim, young and old, children, women, in a single day—on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar—with their booty to be despoiled.",
            "The terms of the writ would become legally binding in each and every colony—displayed conspicuously before all the peoples, so that they would be poised on that day.",
            "The couriers were dispatched by urgent royal command, and the decree was delivered in the capital city of Shushan. The king and Haman then sat down for drinks, while the city of Shushan was in confusion."

            "And in each and every colony, wherever the king’s directives and bylaws reached—there was immense grief among the Yehudim, fasting, weeping and lamenting. Sackcloth and ashes cloaked multitudes.",

And I have not been granted an invitation to visit his majesty these thirty days.”",

Having done this, I will come to the king even though it is unlawful and as I am bereft, so must I be further bereft.”",
