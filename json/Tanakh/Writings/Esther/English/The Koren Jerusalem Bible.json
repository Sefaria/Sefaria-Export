            "Now it came to pass in the days of Aĥashverosh, (this is Aĥashverosh who reigned, from Hoddu as far as Kush, a hundred and twenty seven provinces:)",
            "that in those days, when the king Aĥashverosh sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the capital,",
            "in the third year of his reign, he made a feast for all his princes and his servants; the military power of Paras and Maday, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him:",
            "when he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, namely a hundred and eighty days.",
            "And when these days were fulfilled, the king made a feast for all the people that were present in Shushan the capital, both for great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace:",
            "there were hangings of white, of fine cotton, and blue, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple on silver rods and pillars of marble: the divans were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of alabaster, marble, pearl and precious stone.",
            "And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse from one another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the king’s bounty.",
            "And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man’s pleasure.",
            "Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women, in the royal house which belonged to king Aĥashverosh.",
            "On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Bizzeta, Ĥarvona, Bigta, and Avagta, Zetar, and Karkas, the seven chamberlains who served in the presence of Aĥashverosh the king,",
            "to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to show the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look on.",
            "But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s commandment by his chamberlains: therefore the king was very wrathful, and his anger burned in him.",
            "Then the king said to the wise men, who knew the times, (for so was the king’s manner toward all that knew law and judgment:",
            "and the next to him was Karshena, Shetar, Admata, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memukhan, the seven princes of Paras and Maday, who saw the king’s face, and who sat the first in the kingdom;)",
            "What shall we do to the queen Vashti according to law, because she has not performed the bidding of the king Aĥashverosh by the chamberlains?",
            "And Memukhan answered before the kingand the princes, Vashti the queen has not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the peoples who are in all the provinces of the king Aĥashverosh.",
            "For this deed of the queen will be made known to all the women, so as to make their husbands contemptible in their eyes, when it shall be reported that the king Aĥashverosh commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.",
            "And the princesses of Paras and Maday, who have heard of the deed of the queen, shall be telling of it today to all the king’s princes. Thus shall there be contempt and wrath in plenty.",
            "If it please the king, let a royal commandment go out from him, and let it be written among the laws of Paras and Maday, so that it be not altered, that Vashti come no more before king Aĥashverosh; and let the king give her royal estate to another who is better than she.",
            "And when the king’s decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his kingdom, which is great, all the wives shall give honour to their husbands, both to high and low.",
            "And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memukhan:",
            "for he sent letters into all the king’s provinces, into every province according to its writing, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and speak according to the language of his people."

            "Then the king’s servants who ministered to him said, Let fair young virgins be sought for the king:",
            "and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins to Shushan the capital, to the house of the women, to the custody of Hege the king’s chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their ointment be given them:",
            "and let the girl who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.",

            "So it came to pass, when the king’s commandment and his decree were heard, and when many young girls were gathered together to Shushan the capital, to the custody of Hegay, that Ester was brought also to the king’s house, to the custody of Hegay, keeper of the women.",
            "And the girl pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her ointments, and her appointed rations, and the seven maids chosen to be given her, out of the king’s house: and he advanced her and her maids to the best place in the house of the women.",
            "Ester had not made known her people or her descent: for Mordokhay had charged her that she should not tell.",
            "And Mordokhay walked every day before the court of the women’s house, to know how Ester did, and what should become of her.",
            "Now when every girl’s turn was come to go in to king Aĥashverosh, after she had been twelve months under the regulations for the women, (for so were the days of their anointing, namely, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with other ointments of the women;)",
            "this is how the girl would come to the king: whatever she desired would be given her to take with her out of the house of the women into the king’s house:",
            "in the evening she would go, and on the morrow she would return to the second house of the women, to the custody of Sha῾ashgaz, the king’s chamberlain, who kept the concubines: she would come in to the king no more, unless the king delighted in her, and she were called by name.",
            "Now when the turn of Ester, the daughter of Aviĥayil the uncle of Mordokhay, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in to the king, she requested nothing but what Hegay the king’s chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Ester obtained favour in the sight of all those who looked upon her.",
            "So Ester was taken to king Aĥashverosh into his royal house in the tenth month, which is the month Tevet, in the seventh year of his reign.",
            "And the king loved Ester more than all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.",
            "Then the king made a great feast for all his princes and his servants, Ester’s feast; and he granted a remission of taxes to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.",
            "And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, Mordokhay was sitting at the king’s gate.",
            "Ester had not yet made known her kindred or her people; as Mordokhay had charged her: for Ester carried out the bidding of Mordokhay, just as when she was brought up with him.",
            "In those days, while Mordokhay sat in the king’s gate, two of the king’s chamberlains, Bigtan and Teresh, of those who kept the door, became disaffected, and sought to lay hands on the king Aĥashverosh.",
            "And the thing became known to Mordokhay, who told it to Ester the queen; and Ester reported it to the king in Mordokhay’s name.",

            "Then the king’s servants, who were in the king’s gate, said to Mordokhay, Why dost thou transgress the king’s commandment?",
            "Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily to him, and he did not hearken to them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordokhay’s words would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew.",
            "And when Haman saw that Mordokhay did not bow or do him obeisance, then Haman was full of wrath.",

            "In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Aĥashverosh, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar.",
            "And Haman said to king Aĥashverosh, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are different from all people; nor do they keep the king’s laws: therefore it is of no benefit to the king to tolerate them.",
            "If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will weigh out ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who have the charge of the business, to bring it into the king’s treasuries.",

            "the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Aĥashverosh, to lay hands on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell upon all the peoples.",
            "And all the rulers of the provinces, and the satraps, and the governors, and the royal officials, supported the Jews; because the fear of Mordokhay had fallen upon them.",
            "For Mordokhay was great in the king’s house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces: for the man Mordokhay grew greater and greater.",
            "Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and with slaughter, and destruction, and did as they pleased to those who hated them.",
            "And in Shushan the capital the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men,",
            "and they also slew\n\t\t\t\tParshandata,and\n\t\t\t\tDalfon,and\n\t\t\t\tAspata,",
            "and\n\t\t\t\tPorata,and\n\t\t\t\tAdalya,and\n\t\t\t\tAridata,",
            "and\n\t\t\t\tParmashta,and\n\t\t\t\tArisay,and\n\t\t\t\tAriday,and\n\t\t\t\tVayzata,",
            "the ten\n\t\t\t\tsons of Haman the son of Hammedata, the enemy of the Jews; but they did not lay their hands on the plunder.",
            "On that day the number of those who were slain in Shushan the capital was brought before the king.",
            "And the king said to Ester the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the capital, and also the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces? now what is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what more dost thou request? and it shall be done.",
            "Then Ester said, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews who are in Shushan to do tomorrow also according to this day’s decree, and let Haman’s ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.",
            "And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given at Shushan; and they hanged Haman’s ten sons.",
            "For the Jews who were in Shushan gathered themselves together also on the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men at Shushan; but they did not lay their hands on the plunder.",
            "But the other Jews who were in the king’s provinces gathered themselves together, and stood up for themselves, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy five thousand, (but they did not lay their hands on the plunder,)",
            "on the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.",
            "But the Jews who were at Shushan gathered together on the thirteenth of the month, and on the fourteenth of it; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.",
            "Therefore the Jews of the villages, who dwell in the unwalled towns, make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, and holiday, and of sending choice portions to one another.",
            "And Mordokhay wrote these things, and sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of the king Aĥashverosh, both near and far,",
            "to enjoin upon them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, year by year,",
            "as the days on which the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month which was turned to them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning to holiday: that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of sending choice portions to one another, and gifts to the poor.",
            "And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordokhay had written to them;",
            "because Haman the son of Hammedata, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had schemed against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, (that is, the lot,) to consume them, and to destroy them;",
            "but when Ester came before the king, he gave orders in writing that his wicked scheme, which he had devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.",
            "Therefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. Therefore because of all the words of this letter, and of what they had seen concerning this matter, and what had befallen them,",
            "the Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all who joined themselves to them, that they should unfailingly keep these two days according to their writing, and according to their appointed time every year;",
            "and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, or the memorial of them perish from their seed.",
            "Then Ester the queen, the daughter of Aviĥayil, and Mordokhay the Jew, wrote with all emphasis, to confirm this second letter of Purim.",
            "And he sent letters to all the Jews, to the hundred and twenty seven provinces of the kingdom of Aĥashverosh, in words of peace and truth,",
            "to confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed, according as Mordokhay the Jew and Ester the queen had enjoined on them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed, with regard to the fastings and the order of lamentation.",
            "And the decree of Ester confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book."
