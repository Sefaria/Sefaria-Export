The text here is deficient in several places; the text of the Babli is clearly derivative. The best text is that of <i>Gen</i>.<i> rabba</i> on the verse (<i>Gen</i>. 33:18): “He graced the entrance to the city,” which is explained as “they were putting up duty free shops and selling at wholesale prices.” Since the verse is given here also as a reason (in a shortened and rather incomprehensible connection), it is best to give the entire text from <i>Gen</i>.<i> rabba</i>, which is explicit where the text here is cryptic:<br>“R. Simeon ben Ioḥai <i>and his son R</i>.<i> Eleazar</i> were hidden in a cave for thirteen years during the time of persecution [after the war of Bar Kokhba]. They ate dry carobs until their bodies were covered with rust. At the end of thirteen years he went and sat at the entrance to the cave. He saw a catcher out to catch birds. When he heard a heavenly voice saying <i>dimissus </i>[acquitted], it escaped, <i>when he heard </i>spicula <i>[arrows]</i>,<i> it was caught</i>. He said, no bird will be caught without Heaven, much less a human. He went out and saw that words of intercession were given <i>and the decree had been rescinded</i>. They came and bathed in the hot waters of Tiberias. His son said to him, all this benefit we had from Tiberias and we do not cleanse it from the slain? He said, we need to do something good as our forefathers did when they were putting up duty free shops [ἀτελής] and selling at wholesale prices. What did he do? He took lupines, cut them up and threw <i>the pieces</i> down in irregular fashion. Everywhere there was a slain body, it was floating <i>and they removed it</i>.<i> Everywhere there was no impurity</i>,<i> the lupines remained unmoved</i>.<i> He put up signs indicating which places were pure and which impure until he had cleansed it completely</i>. A <i>vulgar</i> Samaritan saw him and said, should I not make a fool of this old Jew? He took a corpse (<i>some people say from the cooper’s market</i>,<i> some say from the sackmaker’s</i>), went, and buried it where the ground was purified. The next morning, he came to them and said, did you say that bar Yoḥai purified Tiberias? Come and see this corpse! R. Simeon bar Ioḥai saw by the Holy Spirit that he had put it there. He said, I decree that the upper one shall go down [die] and the lower one come up [live]. So it happenend to him. He [R. Simeon bar Ioḥai] went up to spend the Sabbath in his house. When he passed by Magdala <i>of the dyers</i>, he heard the voice of <i>Nikai</i> the scribe who said, <i>did you not say</i> bar Ioḥai purified Tiberias? <i>They found a corpse</i>! He said, It should come upon me if I <i>did not have traditions in the number of the hairs on my head</i> that Tiberias is pure, <i>except places X and Y</i>.<i> Were you not in the meeting when we declared it pure</i>?<i> You broke down the fence of the Sages; about you it was said </i>(<i>Eccl</i>. 10:8): ‘<i>He who tears down a fence will be bitten by a snake</i>’! Immediately he turned into a bone heap.”<br>When Herod Antipas built Tiberias on the site of the Biblical Raqqat, he destroyed a cemetery (Josephus, <i>Antiquities</i>, XVIII. 2. 3) so that no priest or anybody keeping the laws of purity could visit there. Therefore, up to the time of R. Simeon ben Ioḥai Tiberias was only a place of the vulgar.<br>",

As explained in the Introduction to <i>Berakhot</i>, medieval authors are not to be considered as ms. sources, even if the passage is quoted for itself, not in the course of an argument where paraphrases are common.

On that occasion, he has to declare in the Temple that he “did not separate it while impure” (<i>Deut.</i> 26:14; <i>Bikkurim</i> 2:2). This implies that Second Tithe becomes desecrated by impurity and must be redeemed. The question is whether eating Second Tithe in any state of impurity is a criminal offense, for which the punishment is whipping. The thesis advanced here is that Second Tithe has a status equal to heave, so that tertiary impurity makes that tithe unusable.<br>The Babli certainly agrees that the statement of R. Joshua is not an endorsement of the practice since it quotes Mishnah <i>Tahorot</i> 2:2 in which R. Joshua disagrees with R. Eliezer whom R. Aqiba follows.<br>It is always held that first tithe after separation of the heave of the tithe is totally profane in the hand of the Levite, even if consumption is restricted to Levites of good standing.<br>",
