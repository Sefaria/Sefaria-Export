                "<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “An alley which is higher than twenty,” etc. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This text was copied at the beginning of <i>Eruvin</i> Chapter 1, explained there in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Sukkah 1:1:4-7\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sukkah.1.1.4-7\">Notes 31–57</a>. A dead-end alley can be turned into the private domain of its dwellers for the rules of the Sabbath by turning its entrance into a symbolic gate. For the cross-beam which designates the gate the same measurements as for a <i>sukkah</i> are required for the rabbis and R. Jehudah.</i> Rebbi Yose said it without attribution, Rebbi Aḥa in the name of Rav: The rabbis inferred it from the door of the Sanctuary, but Rebbi Jehudah inferred it from the door of the Hall. An argument from the door of the Hall is sufficient only up to forty cubits, as we have stated there<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Mishnah Middot 3:4\" href=\"/Mishnah_Middot.3.4\">Mishnah <i>Middot</i>3:4</a>.</i>: “The door of the Hall was forty cubits high and twenty cubits wide.” Rebbi Ḥiyya stated, even forty or fifty cubits; Bar Qappara stated, even a hundred cubits. Rebbi Abin said, Rebbi Jehudah follows his opinion and the rabbis follow their opinion, as we have stated there<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Eruvin 9:1:2-5:3\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Eruvin.9.1.2-5.3\">Mishnah <i>Eruvin</i>9:5</a>.</i>, “and similarly one carries under panelled bridges on the Sabbath, the words of Rebbi Jehudah, but the Sages forbid it.” As you are saying there, one considers the roof as if it came down and closed, here also one considers the cross-beam<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">167</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Greek μέλαθρον, τό, a substantial load-bearing beam, not simply a thin plank. Cf. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Eruvin 1:1:26\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Eruvin.1.1.26\"><i>Eruvin</i> Chapter 1, Note 41</a>.</i> as if it came down and closed. This is the opinion of Rebbi Jehudah in the case of a <i>sukkah</i>, this is his opinion in the case of an alley. Also the opinion of the rabbis in the case of a <i>sukkah</i> is their opinion in the case of an alley. But they are not comparable. There are items qualified for a <i>sukkah</i> which are disqualified for an alley and those qualified for an alley but disqualified for a <i>sukkah</i>. Double pointed poles<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Greek δίκρανον, τό.</i> are qualified for a <i>sukkah</i> but disqualified for an alley, and it was stated thus: If he brought four double pointed stakes and thatched over them it is qualified as a <i>sukkah</i> but disqualified for an alley. That is, if they are higher by more than three {hand-breadths} than the walls of the alley. But if they are not higher by more than three {hand-breadths} than the walls of the alley it is qualified. If they are not, but if they are four [hand-breadths] wide they are qualified even if arbitrarily high. Walls may be qualified for a <i>sukkah</i> but disqualified for an alley, and it was stated thus<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Tosefta Sukkah (Lieberman) 1:13\" href=\"/Tosefta_Sukkah_(Lieberman).1.13\">Tosephta <i>Sukkah</i>1:13</a>.</i>: “Two regular and the third even one hand-breadth is qualified.” Rebbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: Two of four hand-breadths each and the third even one hand-breadth is qualified. But for an alley only if it is closed in its four directions. Wider than ten cubits is qualified for a <i>sukkah</i> but disqualified for an alley. “If he drew a vine, or squash, or ivy, and used it as roofing it is disqualified.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Sukkah 1:4:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sukkah.1.4.1\">Mishnah <i>Sukkah</i>1:4</a>.</i>” That means, up to an area of two <i>bet se’ah</i>. But more than an area of two <i>bet se’ah</i> it is a partition made for agriculture where one may transport only four cubits. If its sunshine is more than its shade it is disqualified as <i>sukkah</i> but qualified for an alley. A roofed <i>sukkah</i> is disqualified, a roofed alley is qualified. Rebbi Immi in the name of Rebbi Hoshaia: Not only roofed, but if he put there a cross beam four hand-breadths wide, it makes the alley permitted.",
                "Now is a house which is very high not obligated to have a parapet, or to have a <i>mezuzah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since a <i>sukkah</i> is a temporary house, one has to understand why the rules for a <i>sukkah</i> should be different from those for a house; in particular why a <i>sukkah</i> can be called by this name only up to a height of 20 cubits (11m). Naturally, a <i>sukkah</i> needs no parapet (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Deuteronomy 22:8\" href=\"/Deuteronomy.22.8\"><i>Deut</i>. 22:8</a>) since nobody can walk on its roof, and it needs no <i>mezuzah</i>(<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Deuteronomy 6:9\" href=\"/Deuteronomy.6.9\"><i>Deut</i>. 6:9</a>) since it is used only for 7 days and the obligation of <i>mezuzah</i> starts only with 30 days’ use.</i>? But a house is roofed, a <i>sukkah</i> is not roofed<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A house must be a permanent shelter which also protects against winter rains; this does not apply to the thin thatching covering a <i>sukkah</i>.</i>. We find that thatching is like roofing, as we have stated there<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Sukkah 1:10:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sukkah.1.10.1\">Mishnah 1:10</a>. Everywhere an empty space up to 3 hand-breadths width is disregarded (cf. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Eruvin 1:8:3\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Eruvin.1.8.3\"><i>Eruvin</i> Chapter 1, Note 248</a>). This also applies to houses.</i>, “if the thatching was three hand-breadths distant from the walls it is disqualified.” But a house is completely enclosed, a <i>sukkah</i> is not completely enclosed. If a porch<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Greek ’εξέδρα ‘η, a covered walkway. Cf. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Eruvin 1:1:8\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Eruvin.1.1.8\"><i>Eruvin</i> Chapter 1, Note 88</a>.</i> was totally open to the public domain, do not Rebbi Ila [in the name of]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Corrector’s addition. A comparison with the text in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Eruvin 1:1:9\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Eruvin.1.1.9\"><i>Eruvin</i>(Chapter 1, Note 92</a>) shows that it is unnecessary, and could have been replaced by a comma.</i> Rav and Rebbi Joḥanan both say, one may carry in its entirety<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">While this is a well-defined space, it has no walls. In order to treat it by the rules of an alley one has to hold that the beams which form the frame for the roofing (which may be either a complete roof or simply lattice work) define virtual walls around the walkway. For the rules of the Sabbath, one should compare the porch to an enclosed alley, whose entry beam also cannot be higher than 20 cubits. The rule is waved for the porch.</i>? What about it? Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: The Torah said, <i>in sukkot you shall dwell</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 23:42\" href=\"/Leviticus.23.42\"><i>Lev.</i> 23:42</a>.</i>. Up to twenty cubits a person sits in the shade of the thatching; from twenty cubits and higher he sits in the shade of the walls. Rebbi Jonah said, that is, if you are saying, if it<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The thatching. For him a low thatching in very high walls creates a qualified <i>sukkah</i>.</i> is put higher than twenty cubits on the walls. But if it was put lower than twenty cubits inside the walls it is qualified. Rebbi Yose said to him, in your opinion, since you are saying that it is depending on the walls, it should state that “a <i>sukkah</i> which is higher than twenty cubits on the walls is disqualified.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Jonah’s explanation is rejected; the thatching must be on top of the walls.</i>” Rebbi Abba in the name of Rav, if it only holds a person’s head, most of his body, and his table<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A minimal <i>sukkah</i> has space for one person. Since they were taking dinner lying on couches, there must be room inside for that part ot the couch on which his head and body rest; the legs may be outside. In addition there must be a small table for the food. For any <i>sukkah</i> larger than this, the restriction in height is not valid. Accepted in the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Sukkah 2b\" href=\"/Sukkah.2b\">Babli, 2b</a>.</i>. But if it holds more it is qualified. Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa in the name of Rebbi Joshia, only if its walls do not reach up all the way, but if its walls reach up all the way it is qualified. But does not a <i>baraita</i> disagree<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Tosefta Sukkah (Lieberman) 1:1\" href=\"/Tosefta_Sukkah_(Lieberman).1.1\">Tosephta 1:1</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Sukkah 2b\" href=\"/Sukkah.2b\">Babli 2b</a>.</i>? “Rebbi Jehudah said, it happened that the <i>sukkah</i> of Queen Helena<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Of Adiabene, who moved to Jerusalem as a widow.</i> in Lydda was higher than twenty cubits and the Sages were coming and going there and nobody was saying a word. They said to him, because she was a woman, and a woman is not obligated<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As a positive commandment tied to a specified time it does not apply to women, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 1:7:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.1.7.1\">Mishnah <i>Qiddušin</i>1:7</a>.</i>. He said to them, is that a proof? Did she not have seven learned sons<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is spelled out in the Tosephta that they were sitting with their mother in her <i>sukkah</i>.</i>?” Could you say that the <i>sukkah</i> of Queen Helena only held a person’s head, most of his body, and his table? But it must be that the walls do not reach up all the way. What Rebbi Josia said is reasonable and the <i>baraita</i> does not disagree, since it is the way of rich people to make their walls airy so that cool air may enter<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Therefore it is accepted practice that the height restriction does not apply to a <i>sukkah</i> which is not minimal and whose thatching rests on the walls.</i>.",
                "Rav Hoshaia asked: If he brought a plank<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A solid wooden plank. While it is of vegetable origin, it cannot be used for thatching if it is too wide since it is impermeable by both light and rain. The pillar is standing in the middle of the <i>sukkah</i>. One may either sit under the protruding plank or on top of it.</i> and put it protruding on top of a pillar. It is obvious that if he measures from the plank there are twenty cubits, if he measures from the ground it is not twenty cubits<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">But more than that.</i>. How do you treat this? As disqualified space, as disqualified thatching? If you are treating it as disqualified space, it disqualifies by three hand-breadths<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If it cannot be used for thatching, cf. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Sukkah 1:1:3\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sukkah.1.1.3\">Note 13</a>; <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Sukkah 1:11:2\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sukkah.1.11.2\">Halakhah 10</a>.</i>. If you are treating it as disqualified thatching, it only disqualifies by four cubits<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If the roof is made of solid material, only in the center there is a skylight which can be covered by thatching; this may be a qualified <i>sukkah</i> if the solid material does not extend 4 cubits from the walls. The solid roof then simply is considered a horizontal part of the vertical walls.</i>. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun in the name of Ḥizqiah: Disqualified thatching only disqualifies by four cubits, since it serves only to permit the <i>sukkah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Sukkah 4a\" href=\"/Sukkah.4a\">Babli 4a</a>.</i>. Rebbi Miasha said, I am wondering what was Rav Hoshaia’s problem? Why does he not infer from the statement of Rebbi Abba bar Mamal, since we stated there<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Sukkah 1:10:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sukkah.1.10.1\">Mishnah 1:10</a>.</i>: “If one makes the wall hanging from top to bottom, if it is more than three hand-breadths higher than the ground it is disqualified<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Up to three hand-breadths of empty space are disregarded both on top (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Sukkah 1:1:3\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sukkah.1.1.3\">Note 13</a>) or on the bottom of a wall. The wall is considered as if standing on the ground.</i>;” and Rebbi Abba bar Mamal said, if he does not sit and eats in the shade of the walls, but if he was sitting and eating in the shade of the walls it is qualified<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If he sits on the ground in such a <i>sukkah</i>, it is as if he sits in the open. But if he lies on a couch or sits on a chair higher that 3 hand-breadths, he is surrounded by walls and is under a thatched roof, fulfilling the commandment to sit in the <i>sukkah</i>. Similarly, in the case of Rav Hoshaia, one should say that if he sits on the ground, the <i>sukkah</i> is disqualified, but not if he sits on the plank.</i>. Rebbi Yose said, that of Rebbi Abba bar Mamal is not an inference since Rebbi Abba bar Mamal learned it from another Mishnah, as we have stated there<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Eruvin 8:8:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Eruvin.8.8.1\"><i>Eruvin</i> Mishnah 8:9</a>.</i>: “From a balcony above the sea one may not draw water on the Sabbath unless one made a partition ten hand-breadths high either above or below<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The house is on a lakeshore, the balcony is built over the lake, and there is a hole in the balcony through which a pail may be lowered to draw water. While obviously water is always moving and it cannot be asserted that water drops found under the balcony on the Sabbath were there at sundown, and the water could have come from outside the house’s Sabbath domain, since the restriction is purely rabbinic it is enough that under the balcony one make a symbolic wall whose extension would enclose the water.</i>.” And Rebbi Ze`ira said, Rav Jehudah in the name of Rav: Only if the partition is lowered into the water the full length of a pail<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A quote from <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Eruvin 8:6:2-4\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Eruvin.8.6.2-4\"><i>Eruvin</i> Chapter 8 (Notes 73–80</a>). Since water is always moving, it is impossible to know which molecules will be where at a given time. The answer is that this is irrelevant; at the time the pail is lowered it will draw water only from water on the house’s side of the partition lowered into the lake.</i>. But one cannot compare it. The sea is <i>karmelit</i>, neither private nor public domain<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A technical term defined in this sentence. Cf. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Shabbat 1:1:24\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shabbat.1.1.24\"><i>Šabbat</i>1, Note 73</a>.</i>. But here the Torah said, <i>in sukkot you shall dwell</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 23:42\" href=\"/Leviticus.23.42\"><i>Lev.</i> 23:42</a>.</i>.

Otherwise they are disregarded and the <i>sukkah</i> is qualified.</i>. If it was higher than twenty cubits and he hung there decorations which could be used for thatching they reduce it to (disqualify) [qualify]. Otherwise they reduce it to qualify [disqualify]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">By the same argument as in the previous Note, here one has to accept the corrector’s text, provided that decorations which can count as thatching are hanging down below 20 cubits.

Rebbi Shammai said, what they said about above they said about below. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This text is from <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Eruvin 7:1:2\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Eruvin.7.1.2\"><i>Eruvin</i> Chapter 7 (Note 24</a>). There it is noted that a ditch 10 hand-breadths deep or a wall 10 hand-breadths high separate domains for the rules of the Sabbath. If the ditch is filled with material that is easily blown away, it remains a separator; if it is filled with pebbles it disappears as Sabbath boundary. Similarly, if walls of a <i>sukkah</i> end higher than 3 hand-breadths from the ground, the <i>sukkah</i> cannot be qualified by filling the distance with straw, provender, or grasses; it is qualified if the hole is filled with dust and pebbles. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Sukkah 4a\" href=\"/Sukkah.4a\">Babli 4a</a>.</i> Straw and provender do not diminish in it; dust and pebbles do diminish in it. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, if grasses grew in it, they would not diminish it.",
                "<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This paragraph is from <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Shabbat 1:1:19\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shabbat.1.1.19\"><i>Šabbat</i> Chapter 1, Notes 118</a> ff. While here the problem is that a roof less than 10 hand-breadths from the ground does not have the status of a cover, for the rules of the Sabbath public domain reaches only from the ground to a height of 10 hand-breadths, while private domain extends to an indefinite height. The parallel discussion in the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Sukkah 5a\" href=\"/Sukkah.5a\">Babli is <i>Sukkah</i>5a</a>. Since the entire discussion is Amoraic, one must conclude that for earlier times the limitation of the public domain to 10 hand-breadths from the ground and the minimal height required for a <i>sukkah</i> was tradition not subject to verification from biblical sources.</i> From where that higher than ten [hand-breadths] is a different domain? Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: <i>There I shall make My Appearance to you, and I shall speak to you from above the cover</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 25:6\" href=\"/Exodus.25.6\"><i>Ex.</i> 25:6</a>.</i>. And it is written, <i>you have seen that from Heaven I spoke to you</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 20:22\" href=\"/Exodus.20.22\"><i>Ex.</i> 20:22</a>.</i>. Since speech mentioned there is from another domain, also speech mentioned here is from another domain. But is the Ark not nine hand-breadths<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">1.5 cubits (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 25:10\" href=\"/Exodus.25.10\"><i>Ex.</i> 25:10</a>).</i>? In the House of Rebbi Yannai they said, the cover was one hand-breadth<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Sukkah 5b\" href=\"/Sukkah.5b\">Babli 5b</a>, this is questioned but in the end accepted. The biblical data do not fit the assertion. The cover was square of surface area 3.75(cubit)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup> (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 25:17\" href=\"/Exodus.25.17\"><i>Ex.</i> 25:17</a>). The hand-breadth and the cubit are not well defined.. If we take a small hand-breadth of 8.5 cm, cubit 51 cm, then a cover 2 cubits long, 1.5 cubits wide, and one hand-breadth height would have a volume of 108(hand-breadths)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup> = 66 (dm)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup>. Since the cover was of pure gold, of specific weight about 19, the total weight would have been 1260 kg. But the total weight of gold contributed for the Tabernacle (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 38:24\" href=\"/Exodus.38.24\"><i>Ex.</i> 38:24</a>) was 29.25 talents or, on a basis of 12.5 g for the sheqel, about 1097 kg, not to speak of the fact that a weight of 1.26 tons would have crushed the wooden ark. All these data were well within the knowledge of antiquity. One has to conclude that they imagined the cover to be hollow.</i>. Rebbi Ze`ira asked, from where that the cover was one hand-breadth? Rebbi Ḥananiah bar Samuel stated, for all the vessels in the Sanctuary the Torah gave the measure of length and width, and gave the measure of its height. Except for the cover where the Torah gave the measure of length and width, but did not give the measure of its height. Therefore we shall learn it from the smallest vessel in the Sanctuary, <i>you shall make for it a frame of one hand-breadth all around</i><sup>49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This cryptic statement is explained in the Babli (in the name of Rav Aḥa bar Jacob’s teacher Rav Huna) as referring to <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 16:2\" href=\"/Leviticus.16.2\"><i>Lev.</i> 16:2</a> where Aaron is warned not to appear <i>before the face of the cover</i> except on the day of Atonement. This implies that the cover was not simply a sheet lying over the Ark but had a face, a vertical dimension which is not negligible.</i>. Since there it was one hand-breadth, so also here one hand-breadth. But maybe it refers only to: <i>make a golden wreath as its frame all around</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is impossible to say that in general a new domain starts at 10 hand-breadths since it is commonly accepted that a private domain remains private to an indeterminate height. The Ark was standing in the private domain of the Sanctuary; a reference to it seems to be irrelevant.</i>? Since there it is a minimal size, so here also a minimal size. What about it? Rav Aḥa bar Jacob said, <i>face</i>. There is no <i>face</i> less than a hand-breadth<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the desert, the Ark was travelling in front of the people (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Numbers 10:33\" href=\"/Numbers.10.33\"><i>Num</i>. 10:33</a>) while the Sanctuary was carried in the middle (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Numbers 10:17\" href=\"/Numbers.10.17\">v. 17</a>). At the resting place, the Ark automatically assumed a West-East direction so that the Sanctuary could be placed around it and the tribes camped correctly in the four directions of the compass (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Numbers 2\" href=\"/Numbers.2\"><i>Num.</i>2</a>). The Ark had functions outside the Sanctuary; the reference is legitimate.</i>.",
                "Rebbi Yose asked, if there were a very high chest standing in a house, would it not be permitted to move anything from in it into the house or from the house into it<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Mishnaic times, the building cubit was a standard 6, the vessel cubit 5 hand-breadths. If the Ark was built to vessel standards, it cannot be used to define domains. Whether the vessel standard was used in the Temple is a matter of controversy in the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Menachot 98a\" href=\"/Menachot.98a\">Babli, <i>Menaḥot</i>98a</a>.</i>? But we are dealing with the case when it was indicating to them the geographic directions<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 31:12-18\" href=\"/Exodus.31.12-18\"><i>Ex.</i> 31:12–18</a> and 35:1–3 the observation of the Sabbath is emphasized in the instructions for the building of the Tabernacle. One concludes that the work forbidden on the Sabbath is exactly work needed in building or transporting the Tabernacle. The wagons mentioned here are the 6 wagons donated by the tribal chiefs for the transport of the Sanctuary (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Numbers 7:3\" href=\"/Numbers.7.3\"><i>Num</i>. 7:3</a>).</i>. This is understandable for him who said, a cubit of six {hand-breadths}<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nine hand-breadths of the Ark and one of the cover.</i>.

The argument then is rejected since there is no support for the statement that Aḥimelekh belonged to the outgoing watch; it rather seems that he was the organizer of the service at the Tabernacle.
