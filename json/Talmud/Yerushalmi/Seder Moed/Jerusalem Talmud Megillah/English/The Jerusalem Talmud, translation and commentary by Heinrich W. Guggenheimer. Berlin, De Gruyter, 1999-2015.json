This implies that the Scroll is given to be analyzed<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">While in principle a text posterior to the Pentateuch cannot prescribe any new obligation, only testify to the practice of earlier generations in the interpretation of the law, an exception is made for the Esther scroll, whose prescriptions are considered divine and in which the story is repeated in Chapter 9 for legal interpretation only. Since Sadducees did not recognize Esther as a canonical book, this elevation of the scroll to Pentateuchal status must be considered an anti-Sadducee demonstration.</i> Rebbi Ḥelbo, Rebbi Yasa in the name of Rebbi Eleazar: It is said here<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Esther 9:30\" href=\"/Esther.9.30\"><i>Esth</i>. 9:30</a>.</i>, <i>words of peace and truth</i>.

                "“Places walled from the days of Joshua bin Nun read on the Fifteenth.” Rebbi Simon in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: They honored the Land of Israel which was desolate in those days and attached it to the days of Joshua bin Nun. Then should not everybody read on the Fifteenth? Rebbi Abbahu analyzed “dwelling, dwelling”. Since “dwelling” mentioned there refers to the days of Joshua bin Nun, so also “dwelling” mentioned here refers to the days of Joshua bin Nun<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The basis for this argument and the next one is <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Esther 9:19\" href=\"/Esther.9.19\"><i>Esth</i>. 9:19</a>: <i>Therefore the dispersed Jews who dwell in open towns celebrate the Fourteenth of the Month of Adar</i>. While this does not prove that the inhabitants of walled cities read on the Fifteenth, it makes clear that those in open towns do not read on the Fifteenth. The only question is whether the town has to be open at the time of reading or had to be open at the time of the conquest. Now “dwelling” is mentioned in the verse, and it is mentioned as a duty to dwell in the Land after the conquest in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Deuteronomy 12:10\" href=\"/Deuteronomy.12.10\"><i>Deut</i>. 12:10</a>.</i>. Then should not everybody read on the Fourteenth? Rebbi Jehudah bar Pazy analyzed “open, openness.” It is said here “openness” and it said there<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Deuteronomy 3:5\" href=\"/Deuteronomy.3.5\"><i>Deut</i>. 3:5</a>.</i> <i>except for very many open towns</i>.

Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Jehudah said to him, what has the reference to Susa the Fortress to do here? If you are inferring from Susa the Fortress then one should read in Susa the Fortress, but not read at any other place<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Not even in the city of Susa which in the Scroll is clearly distinguished from the government complex, the Fortress.</i>.” It seems that there are three Tannaim.

Rebbi Mana said before Rebbi Yose: When do we need this? Not for Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish?

Then the Mishnah restricts this investigation to the first two times.

Rebbi Ḥanina said, the Mishnah says so, “the only difference between a sufferer from skin disease who is quarantined and one declared absolute is torn clothing, untended hair, shaving, and birds.” This implies that we are dealing with two persons. If you would say about one person, one should state: “the only difference between a large white spot and a small white spot.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">244</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A large white spot is one looking depressed and containing a white hair which is impure (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 13:3\" href=\"/Leviticus.13.3\"><i>Lev</i>. 13:3</a>). A small one is one not looking depressed and without a white hair (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 13:4\" href=\"/Leviticus.13.4\"><i>Lev</i>. 13:4</a>) which requires quarantine.</i>” Just as you are saying there, we are dealing with two persons, so also here we are dealing with two persons<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">245</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Also the first sentence of the Mishnah refers to two different people.</i>.",

If the entire skin of the patient is diseased, he is pure. Naturally while the disease is spreading he satisfies all conditions of severe purity, but since this requires a pronouncement by the Cohen, if there were no clear signs of impurity when he was put in quarantine and at the end of the quarantine the entire skin already was diseased, the Cohen who sees him only at the start and the end of his 7 days of quarantine has to declare him pure out of quarantine without ever pronouncing him absolutely impure.</i>, Rebbi Joḥanan said, he needs birds. Rebbi Eleazar said, he does not need birds. Rebbi Abba bar Mamal said, a <i>baraita</i> supports Rebbi Joḥanan: <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">247</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sifra Mesora`</i> Introduction 6–8.</i>“<i>From the sufferer from skin disease</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">248</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 14:3\" href=\"/Leviticus.14.3\"><i>Lev</i>. 14:3</a>. As introduction to the bird ceremony the Cohen has “to see that the skin disease was healed from the sufferer from skin disease.” Skin disease can be healed only from a sufferer from the disease; the final remark seems to be redundant. It is added to include also a sufferer who never was declared as such.</i>; to include one on whom it spread on his entire person that he needs birds. Is that not a logical argument? If a person became pure and the signs of what made him impure are not on him shall need birds<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">249</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The disappearance of his symptoms is the sign that he is healed, in contrast to the person who is pure but far from healed in that all his skin is infected.</i>, (should not) [is it not logical that]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">250</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The corrector’s changes are from the (Babylonian style) <i>Sifra</i>.</i> one who became pure and the signs of what made him impure are on him [shall] need birds?

So do not wonder if one on whom it spread while in quarantine and the signs of what made him impure are on him does not need birds. The verse says, <i>from the sufferer of skin disease</i> to include one on whom it spread on his entire person that he needs birds.” If you would say that one becoming pure in quarantine does not need birds, should he not have objected that it would have been better to argue spreading against spreadings and not staying stable against spreadings<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">252</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the proof that the <i>Sifra</i> supports the opinion of R. Joḥanan since following R. Eleazar instead of appealing to purity after a lengthy quarantine the Tanna should have mentioned the case of fast spreading skin disease which at the next inspection by the Cohen already has changed from a sign of impurity to one of purity and does not need birds.</i>? Rebbi Ḥananiah the colleague of the rabbis: the <i>baraita</i> supports Rebbi Joḥanan since the Tanna answers his colleague, no. If you are saying about this one who never was up to be declared absolute, what can you say about the one who was to be declared absolute<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">253</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The case of dispute between R. Joḥanan and R. Eleazar is not comparable to other cases of skin disease since the Cohen is not empowered to inspect during the quarantine; the patient never was in a state to be declared absolutely impure.</i>? Because he was to be declared absolute, he needs birds. Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa said, the closing statement<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">254</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The second sentence of the Mishnah.</i> supports Rebbi Eleazar. The one becoming pure in quarantine is not liable for torn clothing, and untended hair, and shaving, and birds. All of this is what we are considering here, about spreadings<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">255</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This seems to refer to a statement similar to the wording of the Mishnah in the Babli: The only difference between one declared pure after quarantine and one declared pure after being absolutely impure is shaving and birds. Since this envisages a situation like the one discussed here, it explicitly supports the Babylonian R. Eleazar.</i>. Rebbi Samuel bar Eudaimon said, all they are disagreeing is about bringing birds. But in the matter of bringing a sacrifice everybody agrees that he does not bring a sacrifice.

Probably it should read “with the king at sundown before the Day of Atonement.” If the Arab was not converted to Judaism, the High Priest would have had to leave the holy precinct on the Day of Atonement, a most unlikely happening before he had finished all his duties.<br>The version of the text presupposes that the king had immersed himself in a <i>miqweh</i> so he could enter the restricted area on the Temple Mount. Nevertheless, (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Chagigah 2:7:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Chagigah.2.7.1\">Mishnah <i>Ḥagigah</i> 2:7</a>) “The garments of the vulgar are severely impure for Pharisees; the garments of Pharisees are severely impure for those eating heave; the garments of those eating heave are severely impure for those sacrificing.” The severe impurity of מִדְרָס referred to here is the impurity of seats or beds used by a sufferer from gonorrhea or a menstruating woman, which makes anyone touching it impure and requires immersion in water and waiting until sundown. Since the king could not sacrifice on the Day of Atonement, he could not have immersed himself with an intention which would make him co-pure with the High Priest. Since the incident happened at sundown, the High Priest was automatically disqualified for the next 24 hours.<br>While a living Gentile is not under the rules of biblical impurity, rabbinically every Gentile is impure and this impurity cannot be removed by immersion in water (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Avodah Zarah 36b\" href=\"/Avodah_Zarah.36b\">Babli <i>Avodah zarah</i> 36b</a>).</i> and a drop of spittle squirted on his garment and defiled him.

The Mishnah in <i>Berakhot</i> states that in reading the <i>Shema`</i> one must hear what one says. The majority holds that this is a desideratum but not an absolute necessity. R. Yose the Tanna disagrees and therefore a person who is deaf but able to speak still cannot read the <i>Shema`</i>. Heave is the part of the harvest which is given to the Cohen as sanctum to be eaten in purity. The dedication must be a conscious act; therefore in Mishnah <i>Terumot</i> 1:1 the deaf-and-dumb person is excluded from those who may dedicate heave.</i> Rav Mattanah said: That formulation is Rebbi Yose’s. Rebbi Yose said: We could be of the opinion that the rabbis and Rebbi Yose disagree only about <i>Shema`</i> since there it is written: <i>hear</i>!, but not about any other obligations. Since Rav Mattanah said “that formulation is Rebbi Yose’s”, it is the same for all obligations. What is the reason of Rebbi Yose? <i>Bend your ear to His commandments</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">84</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 15:26\" href=\"/Exodus.15.26\"><i>Ex</i>. 15:26</a>.</i>, your ears should hear what your mouth says.

The formula should have been modified here but, since the Mishnah was transmitted orally and could not be written down, was not modified, to ease memorization.</i>. Rebbi Yose said: It is reasonable to think that Rav Ḥisda concedes that the statement from <i>Terumot</i> is from Rebbi Yose. Rabbi Ḥanania came in the name of Rav Ḥisda, this one is by Rebbi Yose. Rebbi Yose bar Rebbi Abun said: It must be said that that one is Rebbi Yose’s since we have stated the first five cases<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">86</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishnah <i>Terumot</i> 1:1: Five categories of people cannot consecrate heave and if they did it anyhow, their actions are null and void: the deaf-and-dumb, the insane, minors, one who is not the owner, and a non-Jew.” The sixth Mishnah then reads: Five categories of people should not consecrate heave (since a priori it requires the recitation of a benediction) but if they did it anyhow their actions are valid: the speechless, the drunk, the naked, the blind, those impure by emission of semen.” In between it is explained that חֵרֵשׁ means a deaf-and-dumb person who is not legally capable of acting but that the deaf who can talk belongs to the same category as the second group of five.</i> and did not include it, because their heave is no heave. Then we have stated the five later ones and did not include it. So in the end you must say, that one is by Rebbi Yose<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">87</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Therefore, Mishnah <i>Terumot</i> 1:2, explaining that the deaf person who is able to speak can give heave, has to be formulated separately and could not be included in <i>Terumot</i> 1:6 since the first and sixths Mishnayot are Rebbi Yose’s who will object to the inclusion of the deaf person in the second group but not to that of the speechless.</i>.",

The derivation here does not fulfill these conditions; hence, it is labelled to follow the rules of R. Aqiba who is not known to require too much formality in case the verse is used to give a biblical base to an old tradition.</i>. Just as the Name that is mentioned concerning Torah implies a benediction before, so the Name that is mentioned concerning food implies a benediction before.

If food that needs no explicit benediction before, needs a benediction afterwards, regarding Torah which needs a benediction before, it is only logical that it should need a benediction afterwards. That works for Torah; what about food? If Torah which needs no benediction afterwards, needs a benediction before, regarding food which needs a benediction afterwards, it is only logical that it should need a benediction before.

One may recite a benediction on one’s bread and one’s water only before it is consumed; afterwards one may speak only of nourishment and sustenance.</i>. Rebbi said, if he has to give praise when he ate and is satiated, so much more at a time when he is hungry for food. That is for food, what about Torah?

Tthe baraita seems to represent early Babylonian practice; we do not know of any direct Yerushalmi source that let people read the Torah without benediction. Rebbi Ze`ira, the Galilean head of academy who had come from Babylonia, is the right person to ask for the reasons and the correct practice. Since his questions remain without answers, both practices might be acceptable.</i>, how are you treating them? As three who ate together or as three who ate each one for himself? If you treat them as three who ate together then the first one recites the benediction before, the last one recites the benediction after, and the middle one does not recite any benediction at all. If you treat them as three who ate each one for himself then even the middle one recites benedictions before and after. Rebbi Samuel ben Eudaimon said, they did learn the benedictions for the Torah from Grace only in public<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Samuel ben Eudaimon seems to object to reciting a benediction after Torah study. Also, since Torah study is a permanent obligation (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Joshua 1:8\" href=\"/Joshua.1.8\"><i>Jos</i>. 1:8</a>) one benediction in the morning is enough to cover all Torah study during the day and evening; one does not have to recite a new benediction for study after an interruption.</i>. If in public, then in private one should not recite any benediction! Rebbi Abba Mari, the brother of Rebbi Yose, said: They made it equal to other commandments of the Torah. Just as other commandments of the Torah need benedictions, this also needs a benediction<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Most commandments need only a benediction before, not after their execution.
