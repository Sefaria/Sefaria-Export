                "Rebbi Jonah in the name of Bar Qappara understood it from the following. <i>As he did on that day,</i> these are the seven days of initiation. <i>Did the Eternal command,</i> this is burning of the Cow<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The priest in charge of burning the Red Cow to produce the ashes which cleanse from the impurity of the dead also had to be separated for seven days (Mishnah <i>Parah</i> 3:1).</i>.

                "What is the difference between the Cohen who burns the Cow and the High Priest on the Day of Atonement? The separation of the first is for purity and his brothers the priests refrain from touching him. The separation of the other is for holiness and his brothers the priests touch him. In the opinion of Rebbi Joḥanan, who infers<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Based on the preceding text, one has to read “does not infer” since in the explanation attributed to R. Joḥanan, burning of the Cow is not mentioned. (In the Babli 2a, an argument close to that of Bar Qappara here is attributed to R. Joḥanan, but this should be irrelevant for the study of the Yerushalmi.)</i> from that verse, [it is exceptional for the Cow, it is an embellishment for the Cow<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The separation of the priest who will burn the Cow is purely rabbinical; Tosephta <i>Parah</i> 3:1.</i>, one understands it.

Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Ada said, that his brothers the priests should not make him impure. [But will he not be impure because of his sprinkling<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since it is to be presumed that the Cohen selected to burn the Cow was pure, water with ashes from prior Cows will make him impure <i>(Sifry Num.</i> 129). But this impurity is minor, it can be removed by immersion in a <i>miqweh</i> and the following sundown. It is obvious that no sprinkling can be done on the day of the burning.<br>In fact, a Pharisee Cohen burning the Cow is made impure and has to cleanse himself in a <i>miqweh</i> on the day of the ceremony because of a quarrel with Sadducees, Mishnah <i>Parah</i> 3:7.</i>?] Rebbi Abun said, even Bar Qappara holds that it is exceptional for the Cow, it is an embellishment for the Cow<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Everybody agrees that the rules for the Cohen burning the Cow are purely rabbinical, not accepted by Sadducees, and bar Qappara’s mention of the burning of the Cow is a far-fetched simile, not an authoritative interpretation of the verse.</i>.",
                "Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish asked before Rebbi Joḥanan<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Babli 3b.</i>: But since the he-goat of initiation obstructs, does the he-goat of the Day of Atonement also obstruct<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the ceremonies for the eighth day of initiation, the commandment to Aaron to take a bull and a he-goat (<i>Lev.</i> 9:2) is one unit; there could be no bull without a he-goat. But in Mishnah <i>Menaḥot</i> 4:2 it is stated that for all holiday sacrifices bulls and he-goats are independent of one another. If the rules of the Day of Atonement are derived from the rules of the initiation rites, the Mishnah would have to state an exception for the Day of Atonement.</i>? And he accepted it from him<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The rules of the Day of Atonement cannot be derived from the rules of the initiation rites.</i>. [On that Rebbi Mana said, I am wondering how could Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish ask before Rebbi Joḥanan and he accepted it from him?] Should he not have objected to him that we do not find that anything obstructing can be inferred from anything not obstructing, nor can anything not obstructing be inferred from anything obstructing? “He breaks the neck”, “to burn in smoke”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the rules of the elevation offering of a bird <i>(Lev.</i> 1:15), in the same verse it is required that the Cohen break the neck of the bird and burn it in smoke on the altar.</i>. Since (breaking the neck)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This must read: “burning in smoke”.</i> is done on top of the altar, so (breaking the neck) [burning in smoke]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The text in parentheses was first written by the scribe, the text in brackets is the correction. The original text in parentheses is the correct one. <i>Sifra Wayyiqra</i> I <i>Parshata</i> 7(4).</i> is done on the top of the altar. Breaking the neck obstructs, burning in smoke does not obstruct<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If the sacrifice would become impure and disqualified after the breaking of the neck but before the burning, the offerer has fulfilled his vow and it is not necessary to bring a second sacrifice.</i>. “Permanently,” [“permanently].” “Permanently” is mentioned for the pan-baked breads<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Therefore one part of R. Mana’s objection has been shown to be invalid.<br>The daily offering of the High Priest <i>(Lev.</i> 6:12–16), a tenth of an <i>epha</i> of fine flour baked into “breads” (v. 14) without a specified number. “Permanent” is stated in v. 13.</i> and “permanently” is mentioned for the shew-bread<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The shew-bread is specified as 12 loaves, <i>Lev.</i> 24:5. The arrangement is called “permanent” in v. 24:8.</i>.] The shew-breads are obstructive, the pan-baked breads are not obstructive. Since [“permanently” mentioned for the pan-baked breads refers to twelve,] so “permanently” mentioned [for the shew-bread refers to twelve<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is obvious that here also one has to switch the places of “shew-bread” and “panbaked breads”. The number of breads of the High Priest is fixed as 12 in Mishnah <i>Menaḥot</i> 6:5, but a deviation from this number invalidates only shew-bread, not the High Priest’s offering.</i>. “Taking”, “taking”. “Taking” mentioned in Egypt<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ex.</i> 12:22, the commandment to take “a bundle of hyssop”.</i>, “taking” is mentioned for <i>lulav</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Lev.</i> 23;40, the commandment to take 4 kinds of plants; it is not mentioned that they must be tied as a bundle.</i><i>.</i> [Since “taking” mentioned in Egypt implies a bundle<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the Babli <i>Sukkah</i> 11b, and <i>Sifra Emor Pereq</i> 16(1), this is rejected as R. Jehudah’s minority opinion.</i>, so also “taking” mentioned for <i>lulav</i> implies a bundle<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Both of R. Mana’s objections were disregarded by Tannaim; R. Simeon ben Laqish is justified.</i>.] For the <i>lulav</i> it obstructs, in Egypt it did not obstruct. Therefore we found things obstructing can be inferred from anything not obstructing, and things not obstructing can be inferred from anything obstructing<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Babli 4a.</i>.",
                "Since Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish has this objection, from where does Rebbi Simeon derive it<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The rule that the High Priest is separated from his family for seven days before the Day of Atonement.</i>? Following that of Rebbi Ismael:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Babli 4a.</i> <i>With this Aaron shall come into the Sanctuary</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Lev.</i> 16:3.</i><i>,</i> what was said in the matter<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Of Aaron’s induction into the High Priesthood.</i>. One separates him all of seven days, he serves all of seven days, and one initiates him all of seven days. Also in this case one separates him all of seven days, he serves all of seven days, and one initiates him all of seven days. Is that spelled out in the matter? But since the death of Aaron’s sons is mentioned in the matter<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Lev.</i> 16:1.</i> and they died during the initiation, it is as if the matter was mentioned. Does not in the end Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish understand it from the same verse<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He still has to explain the same verse used by R. Joḥanan and Bar Qappara, which he himself proved to be inadequate.</i>? But he is like a person who hears a statement and questions it. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, the reason of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish is: <i>the glory of the Eternal was dwelling on Mount Sinai</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ex.</i> 24:16.</i><i>.</i> Just as Moses did not enter the Holiest of Holies before he was sanctified in the cloud all of seven days, so Aaron did not enter the Holiest of Holies before he was inducted by the anointing oil all of seven days<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is not a biblical requirement but popular usage supported by an aggadic argument.</i>.",
                "In Rebbi Joḥanan’s opinion, why is the death of Aaron’s sons mentioned in the matter when they died during initiation? Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said, Aaron’s sons died on the First of Nisan; why does He mention their death at the Day of Atonement<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Lev.</i> 16:1.</i>?

Rebbi Yudan bar Shalom said, why did the verse append the death of Aaron to the breaking of the Tablets<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The breaking of the Tablets and the story of the Golden Calf are quoted in <i>Deut.</i>9:7–29; Aaron’s death is mentioned in 10:6 in a verse which requires further explanation, given in the next paragraph without reference to the Day of Atonement. <i>Lev. rabba</i> 20, end.</i>?

In Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Joseph’s opinion following Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Jehudah there were 21 erections and 20 dismantlings<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">89</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since for R.

In the situation considered here it is noted that the set of numbers &gt;1 has a smallest element, 2, but no largest one. Therefore an indefinite plural used in a biblical law must mean 2, otherwise the meaning would not be definite. This is applied to the laws of <i>zava,</i> a woman impure by non-menstrual blood flow for <i>many days.</i> By the principle of definiteness this means that days are 2, the number of <i>many days</i> is the smallest number &gt;2, or 3.</i> Rebbi Aqiba said, anywhere you could understand many or you could understand few, if you took the many you took nothing, if you took few you took<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">139</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Babli <i>Megillah</i> 17a, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 5a.</i>.

Rav Hoshaia said, “watch yourself, lest, not be deprived,” would be three warnings<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">87</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This now addresses the problem from where could one infer that all prohibitions of the Day of Atonement also apply to the preceding night.

Therefore punishment was spelled out for work only to imply a warning preceding it<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">92</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The argument of Rav Hoshaia is essentially correct but has to be realized differently. Since the warning spelled out for work on the Day of Atonement is shown to be unnecessary, it has to be applied as if it were written twice; supplying the desired additional warning to be read as referring to the preceding night.</i>. Since the punishment indicated for work is preceded by a warning, also the punishment indicated for deprivation is preceded by a warning. Rebbi Zeˋira said, this implies that one may infer about an “equal cut” even if it is free only on one side<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">93</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He reads the argument of R. Ḥiyya not as a conclusion <i>de minore ad majus</i> but as “equal cut” meaning that the expression בְּעֶ֖צֶם הַיּ֣וֹם הַזֶּ֑ה appearing in <i>Lev.</i> 23:29,30 implies that the rules indicated in both verses are the same. In general one requires that an expression used for “equal cut” not be used for any other inference; but here the entire v. 29 is needed both for warning and punishment (Note 84). There remains the problem that since now it is shown that בְּעֶ֖צֶם הַיּ֣וֹם הַזֶּ֑ה does not mean “during daylight only”, the expression is not used for any other deduction and therefore the “equal cut” is between two identical expressions not otherwise needed and therefore valid according to everybody, even R. Ismael. One has to say that since the day is defined in <i>Lev.</i> 23:32 as from evening to evening, בְּעֶ֖צֶם הַיּ֣וֹם הַזֶּ֑ה means that while one has to start fasting and refraining from work somewhat earlier and finish sometime after nightfall the next day, the biblical penalties do not apply to these additional periods and therefore one mention of “on this very day” is needed for this legal implication.<br>Noted as opinion in dispute, Babli <i>Šabbat</i> 64a, <i>Niddah</i> 22b.</i>.

About this one it says, <i>for on that day, He shall atone for you.</i> If one intentionally transgressed {sins punishable by} extirpations or death penalties, repentance and the Day of Atonement atone half, and sufferings during the other days of the year atone half. About this one it says, <i>I shall visit their crime with the rod, and their iniquities with plagues.</i> But by whom the Name of Heaven was desecrated, there is no power in repentance to suspend judgment, nor in the Day of Atonement to pardon, nor in sufferings to scour; but repentance and the Day of Atonement atone one third, sufferings atone a third, and death scours with sufferings. About this one it says, <i>the iniquity of this people shall not be atoned for until you die.</i> From this we learn that death scours.",
