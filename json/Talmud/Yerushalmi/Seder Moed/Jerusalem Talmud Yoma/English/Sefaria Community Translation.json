                "On every day they [used to] remove [the ashes] from off the altar from the crowing of the rooster, either close to it, before it or after it; and on the Day of Atonement at midnight; and on the Festivals at the first watch. The crowing of the rooster would not approach until the [Temple] court was full of Israelites.",
                "Said R. Mana: It is not reasonable [to have the ashes removed at midnight for Yom Kippur and at the first watch for the Festivals]. But [on] Yom Kippur fro the first watch and on the Festivals from midnight, so that they shall not come into the hands of thirst. Said R. Yochanan: The removal of the ashes is the beginning of the service of the morrow, and he must sanctify his hands and feet from the laver which was sunk in water."

                "Originally, whosoever wanted to remove [the ashes from] the Altar, removed [it]. At a time that they were many they would run and ascend the ramp [of the altar] and he that came first into the four cubits won [the privilege]. And if two were even, the appointed one would say to them [all]: Raise the finger(s). And what did they put forward [i.e. raise]? One or two. And [but] they do not put forth [raise] the thumb in the Temple: It happened [once] that two were even, and [they] were running and ascending the ramp. And one [of them] pushed his fellow and his foot was broken. And when the court saw that they were coming into danger, they enacted that they shall not remove [the ashes from] the altar except by lot. There were four lots there, and this [one] was the first lot."

                "All the time that Simeon the Righteous was alive, the lot [for the goat of Hashem] always fell on the right, when Simeon the Righteous died, sometimes it would fall to the right, sometimes to the left. All the time that Simeon the Righteous was alive, the western lamp would shine. When Simeon the Righteous died, sometimes it would flicker out, and sometimes it would burn. All the time that Simeon the Righteous was alive, the crimson thread would become white. When Simeon the Righteous died, sometimes it would become white, sometimes it would remain red. All the time that Simeon the Righteous was alive, there was a \"sending\" blessing on the Showbread and on the double bread, and every one would get their piece, and even if it was an olive-sized piece, there were those who felt satisfied and those who eat and leave. When Simeon the Righteous died, the blessing was suspended from the double bread and the Showbread. There was a story about a priest in Sepphoris, who grabbed his share [of bread] and the share of his fellow, and they called him ‘Son of the Bean,’ to this day, about [people like] him David wrote: \"O my God, rescue me out of the hand of the wicked, out of the grasp of the unrighteous and ruthless man\" (Ps. 71:4) ",
                "It has been taught: Forty years before the destruction of the Temple the western light went out, the crimson thread remained crimson, and the lot for the Lord always came up in the left hand. They would close the gates of the Temple by night and get up in the morning and find them wide open. Said [to the Temple] Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai, “O Temple, why do you frighten us? We know that you will end up destroyed. For it has been said, ‘Open your doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour your cedars!’ ” (Zech 11:1)."
