                "<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> An alley which is higher than twenty cubits should be reduced; Rebbi Jehudah says, this is not necessary<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Shabbat 1:1:23\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shabbat.1.1.23\"><i>Šabbat</i> 1, Note 142</a>. The status of an alley, a narrow public road bordered by walls of houses, essentially is that of a <i>karmelit.</i> Since such an alley is not a thoroughfare, it is customary that under certain circumstances the dwellers in houses opening on the alley can turn it into their common private domain. A prior condition is that the alley be a dead-end street; an alley open at both ends, while not a public domain in the technical sense, does not qualify directly. The second condition, mentioned only in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Eruvin 1:2:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Eruvin.1.2.1\">Mishnah 2</a>, is that the entrance to the alley must be well defined and immediately recognizable; this is done either by placing a horizontal beam over the entrance (קוֹרַה) or placing there a vertical lath (לֶחִי). The Mishnah presumes that a beam was used; the majority holds that a beam placed higher than 20 cubits is not noticed whereas R. Jehudah holds that it always is noticed.</i>. If it is wider than ten cubits it should be reduced<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The entrance to the alley should not be wider than 10 cubits.</i>; if there is a door-frame even though it is wider than ten cubits there is no need to reduce<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If there are two door-posts and a beam from one to the other, even if there are no doors, it is clear that the domain is visibly separated from the thoroughfare onto which it opens.</i>.",
                "<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “An alley which is higher than twenty,” etc. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The same text also is the introduction to Tractate <i>Sukkah</i>1:1 (<b>ס</b>).</i> Rebbi Yose said it without attribution, Rebbi Aḥa in the name of Rav: The rabbis inferred it from the door of the Sanctuary, but Rebbi Jehudah inferred it from the door of the Hall<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The rabbis hold that one does not realize that a beam is there to indicate a door if it is higher than 10 cubits since the entrance door to the Herodian Temple was 10 cubits. R. Jehudah disputes this since the inner door between the antechamber and the main room, visible only to the officiating priests, was larger. The biblical accounts of Solomon’s Temple (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"I Kings 6:2-3\" href=\"/I_Kings.6.2-3\"><i>1K.</i> 6:2–3</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"II Chronicles 3:3-4\" href=\"/II_Chronicles.3.3-4\"><i>2Chr.</i> 3:3–4</a>) do not give measurements of the doors. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Eruvin 2a\" href=\"/Eruvin.2a\">Babli 2a</a>.</i>. An argument from the door of the Hall is sufficient only up to forty cubits, as we have stated there<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Mishnah Middot 3:4\" href=\"/Mishnah_Middot.3.4\">Mishnah <i>Middot</i> 3:4</a>.</i>: “The door of the Hall was forty cubits high and twenty cubits wide.” Rebbi Ḥiyya stated, even forty or fifty cubits; Bar Qappara stated, even a hundred cubits<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He disputes any connection with Temple measurements since R. Jehudah rejects height limitations in general. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Eruvin 2b\" href=\"/Eruvin.2b\">Babli 2b</a>.</i>. Rebbi Abin said, Rebbi Jehudah follows his opinion and the rabbis follow their opinion, as we have stated there<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Eruvin 9:1:2-5:3\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Eruvin.9.1.2-5.3\">Mishnah 9:5</a>.</i>, “and similarly one carries under panelled bridges on the Sabbath, the words of Rebbi Jehudah, but the Sages forbid it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The bridge is supported by a structure of beams underneath with beams running lengthwise on both sides. R. Jehudah holds that the boundary of the space below the bridge is clearly indicated if there are virtual walls hanging down from the beams enclosing the space which therefore assumes the role of a house. The rabbis accept only real walls.</i>” As you are saying there, one considers the cross-beam<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Greek μέλαθρον, τό.

This is the opinion of Rebbi Jehudah in the case of a <i>sukkah,</i> this is his opinion in the case of an alley. Also the opinion of the rabbis in the case of a <i>sukkah</i> is their opinion in the case of an alley. But they do not compare<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The fact that the rabbis take 20 cubits as upper height limit for both the entrance to an alleyway and a <i>sukkah</i> is accidental since the rules in both cases diverge widely.</i>. There are items qualified for a <i>sukkah</i> which are disqualified for an alley and those qualified for an alley but disqualified for a <i>sukkah.</i> Double pointed stakes<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Greek δίκρανον, τό.</i> are qualified for a <i>sukkah</i> but disqualified for an alley, and it was stated thus: If he brought four double pointed stakes and thatched over them it is qualified as a <i>sukkah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One may make a <i>sukkah</i> by putting up four poles carrying a frame on which one thatches a roof on condition that the poles qualify as walls, i. e., each of them is at least 4 hand-breadths wide. Otherwise one would have to make makeshift walls between the poles as described in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Eruvin 1:9:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Eruvin.1.9.1\">Mishnah 9</a>.</i> but disqualified for an alley<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The poles carrying the cross beam may not be much higher than the walls of the alley (or the cross beam cannot be fastened to the tops of the poles, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Eruvin 9a\" href=\"/Eruvin.9a\">Babli 9a</a> top).</i>. That is, if they are higher by more than three [hand-breadths] than the walls of the alley. But if they are not higher by more than three [hand-breadths] than the walls of the alley it is qualified. If they are not, but if they are four [hand-breadths] wide they are qualified even if arbitrarily high<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If a pole qualifies as a wall it is clear that it may be 20 cubits high for the rabbis and arbitrarily high for R. Jehudah.</i>. Walls may be qualified for a <i>sukkah</i> but disqualified for an alley, and it was stated thus: “Two regular and the third even one hand-breadth is qualified<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Tosefta Sukkah (Lieberman) 1:13\" href=\"/Tosefta_Sukkah_(Lieberman).1.13\">Tosephta <i>Sukkah</i> 1:13</a>. A <i>sukkah</i> must be at least 10 hand-breadths high and the sides have to be at least 7 hand-breadths wide.</i>.” Rebbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: Two of four hand-breadths each and the third even one hand-breadth is qualified<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As explained in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Eruvin 1:9:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Eruvin.1.9.1\">Mishnah 9</a>, a space of slightly less that 3 hand-breadths is disregarded. Therefore a wall qualifies as being 7 hand-breadths wide if the actual material wall extends to slightly more than 4 hand-breadths.</i>. But for an alley only if it is closed in its four directions<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It must have three actual walls and a symbolic door on the fourth side.</i>. Wider than ten cubits is qualified for a <i>sukkah</i> but disqualified for an alley<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Eruvin 1:1:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Eruvin.1.1.1\">Mishnah 1</a> for the alley.

The thatched roof of a <i>sukkah</i> must be vegetal material not connected to the ground. Therefore vine or squash are disqualified to be used for thatching. But a vine growing in an arch over the entrance of an alley is as good as a beam to mark the entrance.</i>” That means, up to an area of two <i>bet se’ah.</i> But more than an area of two <i>bet se’ah</i> it is a partition made for agriculture where one may transport only four cubits<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A vine used to designate the entrance to an alley may be used only if the total area of the alley does not exceed 5’000 square cubits since this is the maximal size of farming or ranching corrals permitted for Sabbath use. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Eruvin 23b\" href=\"/Eruvin.23b\">Babli 23b</a>.</i>. If its sunshine is more than its shadow it is disqualified as <i>sukkah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Sukkah 1:1:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sukkah.1.1.1\">Mishnah <i>Sukkah</i> 1:1</a>. Since alleys usually have no roof, they are not expected to provide shade.</i> but qualified for an alley. A roofed <i>sukkah</i> is disqualified, a roofed alley is qualified<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The essence of a <i>sukkah</i> is its makeshift thatched roof; it is not a <i>sukkah</i> if it has a waterproof roof. But if the entrance to an alley passes under a permanent roof at least 4 hand-breadths wide it does not need any other sign at the entrance. If the alley is open at both ends and one end is roofed, it is considered a dead-end alley. Cf. S. Liebermann, <i>Tosephta ki-Fshutah</i> part 3, p. 309, on <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Tosefta Eruvin (Lieberman) 1:7\" href=\"/Tosefta_Eruvin_(Lieberman).1.7\">Tosephta 1:7</a>.</i>.

Samuel said, practice follows the lenient opinion in <i>Eruvin.</i> Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi said to him, for example what we have stated there, “and similarly one carries under panelled bridges on the Sabbath, the words of Rebbi Jehudah, but the Sages forbid it<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The bridge is supported by a structure of beams underneath with beams running lengthwise on both sides.

He told him, did I not say <i>Eruvin</i> but partitions<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The case of a bridge is not a case of <i>turning</i> a common domain into private domain but whether the space under a bridge automatically has the status of a permanent dwelling which does not need any <i>eruv.</i></i>? Cahana shares Samuel’s opinion<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">67</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He agrees with Samuel not only that in matters of <i>eruv</i> one follows the lenient opinion but also that the principle does not apply to questions of partitions. In the matter of an alley he holds that turning it into a private domain needs two things, first the fixation of the entrance partition described in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Eruvin 1:1:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Eruvin.1.1.1\">Mishnah 1:1</a> to which the principle does not apply, and the collection of an <i>eruv</i> as described in Chapter 2, to which the principle does apply.</i>. Therefore it was necessary to say that practice does not follow Rebbi Jehudah.",
                "They only said “higher than twenty”. Therefor at the end of twenty it is qualified. This follows Rav who said that the end of measurements is for leniency; Rebbi Joḥanan said that the end of measurements is for restriction<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As a general principle, every rabbinic statement that a quantity <i>x</i> is qualified up to a limit <i>a</i> is read by Rav as “<i>x</i> less or equal to whereas R.

In the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Eruvin 3a\" href=\"/Eruvin.3a\">Babli, 3a</a> (last line), the position of Rav is represented by the Babylonian Rava, that of R.

Because of the visual impression<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even though Rav said that the upper bound is qualified in theory, in practice he will agree with R. Joḥanan that to avoid errors one has to be restrictive. His example is the rule that ritual slaughter requires that as biblical requirement half of both windpipe and esophagus of the animal have to be cut in slaughter. Nevertheless as a practical rule, since 50–50 is not exactly determinable by visual inspection, one requires that clearly more than half be cut in one stroke; <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Chullin 29a\" href=\"/Chullin.29a\">Babli <i>Ḥulin</i> 29a</a>.</i>.

Seventy times two thirds and seventy times two thirds make 140 thirds each; 140 thirds and 140 thirds are 93⅓.

The difference to 5000 is 62/9 = 19/3 -1/9. The additional correction was a problem. Not only is the square root of 5000 irrational, not expressible as a fraction, but of the two square root algorithms used in Antiquity, the Babylonian, using a kind of Newton approximation, is an approximation from above and the Hellenistic, using an equivalent of modern continued fractions, starts with an approximation from above, when the legal situation here demands an approximation from below. 70⅔, is a reasonable rational approximation from below to √5000 since 707/9<sup>2</sup> already is &gt;5009. The second term of the continued fraction development is an approximation from below, 70140/197, not a practical expression. The systematic approximation of square roots from below which used to be taught in our schools is essentially dependent on the notion of place values underlying Indian- Arabic numerals. The first approximation of √5000 both in the Babylonian and the Hellenistic methods, 705/7, is an exceedingly good low-denominator approximation from above, (705/7)<sup>2</sup> = 500025/49, and therefore not usable in this context.

The Mishnah states that if a person was impure by biblical standards he can be purified only by immersion in a <i>miqweh</i> which is unquestionably valid. But if his impurity is rabbinic, immersion in a <i>miqweh</i> will purify him unless the <i>miqweh</i> is unquestionably invalid. R. Yose disagrees and holds that the principle of permanence of the <i>status quo ante</i> also applies to rabbinic impurity and the <i>miqweh</i> must be unquestionably valid.</i>: “If there is a doubt, it is pure; Rebbi Yose declares it impure.” Rebbi Jonah said, Rebbi Yose declared it impure only because of proof<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">122</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If there are a group of items, the status of one is certain but that of the others is uncertain, one may assume that the other items share the status of the certain one unless proven otherwise (cf. <i>Demay</i> 2:1 2<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">nd</sup> of paragraph; <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Terumot 4:7:7\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Terumot.4.7.7\"><i>Terumot</i> 4:8 Note 83</a>.) The Mishnah quotes the case that there be two <i>miqwaot</i>, one of them known to be invalid, while the other might be valid. If the person does not know in which of the two he immersed, R.

But even he who says there “impure” agrees here that it is permitted<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">124</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The two cases cannot be compared. The rules of impurity are biblical even if they are extended to cover cases of only rabbinic impurity. The rules of <i>eruv</i> are all rabbinic.</i>. Rebbi Ḥinena said, do they not only disagree about their words? And a doubt about their words is for leniency<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">125</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He holds the opposite view. The Mishnah <i>Miqwaot</i> clearly distinguishes between biblical and rabbinic impurity and decrees leniency only for rabbinic cases; for him the rules of <i>eruv teḥumim</i> are all biblical; only <i>eruv ḥaṣerot</i> is rabbinical.</i>.

Jonathan first quoted <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 16:29\" href=\"/Exodus.16.29\"><i>Ex</i>. 16:29</a> as proof that leaving one’s domain on the Sabbath is a biblical violation. Since no punishment is stated, the standard sanction of flogging applies. To this R. Ḥiyya replies that the standard sanction applies only to prohibitions introduced by לֹא, not to admonitions formulated with אַל. R. Jonathan retorts that this explanation is impossible since eating the Passover sacrifice raw is a punishable transgression forbidden by אַל.</i>, <i>stay everybody where he is, no person shall leave his place on the Seventh day</i>? He said to him, is there written לֹא? No, it is written אַל. Rebbi ben Rebbi Abun said, nevertheless each one kept to his tradition<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">131</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is unresolved whether leaving one’s domain on the Sabbath is a transgression punishable in court.

Rebbi Samuel bar Sosarta said, they treated <i>eruv</i> as a doubt involving a deaf-mute person<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">132</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the interpretation of biblical prohibitions, matters of doubt are treated differently when a person is involved who can be interrogated about the situation.

The reason of Rebbi Joḥanan ben Nuri: Since if he had been awake he would have acquired a Sabbath domain, when he was sleeping he did not acquire a Sabbath domain; he only has 2’000 cubits in every direction. Rebbi Jehudah says, even awake and he did not acquire a Sabbath domain; he only has 2’000 cubits in every direction<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As explained in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Eruvin 4:7:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Eruvin.4.7.1\">Mishnah 9</a>, a Sabbath domain is a rectangular domain (for a single person a square) oriented exactly NS-EW.

For a single person the domain can be determined only by a conscious choice. In the absence of such a choice the Sabbath region is a circle, for the Sages of diameter 8 cubits, for RR. Joḥanan ben Nuri and Jehudah (possibly also R. Eliezer) 2’000 cubits. For RR. Joḥanan ben Nuri and Eliezer the place of the person at sundown automatically is the center of the circle, for R.

                "Rebbi Ḥuna said, Rav Naḥman bar Jacob asked: if a proselyte immersed himself after sunrise. “Since if he had been awake he would have acquired a Sabbath domain,” what does Rebbi Joḥanan ben Nuri say in this case? Let us hear from the following.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">74</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Obviously there is a lacuna here, it is not said how to decide the question. A proselyte becomes Jewish by immersion in a <i>miqweh</i> for the purpose of conversion (for a male, after circumcision), attested to by a competent court. The latter condition excludes conversion on a Sabbath, a fact which Rav Naḥman bar Jacob, chief judge of the Exilarch’s court in Babylonia, must have known. The problem here is not about a proselyte but a general question about the Sabbath domain for a person who on Friday evening was unable or unqualified to choose a Sabbath domain; for example an insane person who became lucid overnight. Since R. Joḥanan ben Nuri restricts his argument to persons who on Friday evening were able to exercise judgment, it is unknown what his opinion would have been in this case.</i> For Rebbi Isaac bar Naḥman<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">75</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Read: R.
