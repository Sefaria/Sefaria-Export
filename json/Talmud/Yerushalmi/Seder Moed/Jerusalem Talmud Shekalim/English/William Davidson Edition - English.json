                "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna taught that the court would issue a proclamation concerning the new shekels on the first of Adar. The Gemara asks: <b>And why</b> specifically <b>on the first of Adar?</b> The Gemara answers: This was done <b>in order that Jews would bring their shekels</b> to the designated Temple chamber <b>in the proper time,</b> as the shekels had to be collected before the beginning of Nisan each year. <b>And</b> this would ensure that the <b>collection</b> of <b>the</b> Temple treasury <b>chamber</b> would be <b>collected from the new</b> shekels <b>at its proper time,</b> which is <b>on the first of</b> the month of <b>Nisan,</b> i.e., the beginning of the Temple year. After that date all communal offerings must be purchased from the new shekels. <b>And Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak said:</b> The <b>collection of the</b> Temple treasury <b>chamber</b> was performed each year on the same date as <b>its first time, as it is written: “And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the Tabernacle was reared up”</b> (Exodus 40:17). <b>And</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught about</b> this verse: <b>On the day that the Tabernacle was erected, on that</b> very <b>day the funds were collected.</b> The first of Nisan was thereafter permanently established as the date for the collection of the chamber. <b>Rabbi Tavi</b> said that <b>Rabbi Yoshiya</b> said <b>in the name of</b> Rabbi <b>Kahana: It is stated here,</b> with regard to the additional offerings of the New Moon: “This is the burnt-offering of every New Moon throughout <b>the months of</b> the year” (Numbers 28:14), <b>and it is stated there,</b> concerning the months of the year: “This month shall be to you the beginning of months; it shall be the first of <b>the months of</b> the year to you” (Exodus 12:2). <b>Just as “the months of” stated there are counted only from Nisan,</b> the first month of the year, <b>so</b> too, <b>“the months of” that is stated here,</b> with regard to the new shekels, <b>are counted only from Nisan.</b> <b>Rabbi Yona said: Rabbi Tavi left</b> aside <b>the first</b> clause <b>of</b> this <b><i>baraita</i>, and read</b> only <b>its latter</b> clause, in which it is stated that the months of the year are counted from Nisan. However, this does not prove that the first of Nisan is the date after which communal offerings must be purchased with the new shekels. <b>This is not as it was taught,</b> as this is the full text of the <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“This is the burnt-offering of a new month on its month,</b> throughout the months of the year” (Numbers 28:14). One <b>might</b> have thought that a person <b>should contribute</b> a half-shekel <b>each and every month.</b> Therefore <b>the verse states: “of a new month on its month, throughout the months,”</b> from which it is inferred: <b>In one</b> particular <b>month</b> a person <b>contributes</b> his half-shekel <b>for all the months of the year.</b> The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that a person can contribute his half-shekel <b>in any month he wants.</b> Therefore, <b>it is stated here,</b> with regard to the additional offerings of the New Moon: <b>“The months of”</b> (Numbers 28:14), <b>and it is stated there,</b> with regard to the months of the year: <b>“The months of”</b> (Exodus 12:2). <b>Just as</b> the phrase <b>“the months of,” which is stated there, is counted only from Nisan,</b> the first month of the year, <b>so</b> too, the phrase <b>“the months of,” which is stated here,</b> with regard to the offerings, <b>is counted only from Nisan.</b>",
                " § The mishna taught that on the first of Adar the court would issue a proclamation concerning the new shekels. The Gemara asks: <b>What does it</b> mean that <b>they proclaim? Rav Huna said: They announce</b> publicly that everyone is obligated to donate the half-shekel. <b>As you say</b> in quoting the verse: <b>“And they made a proclamation throughout Judea and Jerusalem,</b> to bring in for the Lord the tax that Moses, the servant of God, laid upon Israel in the wilderness” (II Chronicles 24:9). The tax of Moses is the half-shekel that the Israelites were commanded to donate.",
                "<b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Megilla</i> 1:4): <b>The only</b> halakhic difference <b>between First Adar and Second Adar</b> is <b>the recitation of the Megilla and the gifts to the poor,</b> which are mitzvot of Purim, which is celebrated only in Second Adar. The Gemara comments: <b>Rabbi Simon</b> says <b>in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: The proclamations about the new shekels and</b> about <b>diverse kinds</b> are <b>also between them,</b> i.e., are performed in Second Adar and not First Adar. The Gemara comments further: <b>Rabbi Ḥelbo and Rav Huna</b> said that <b>Rav</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great</b> as follows: <b>All fulfill</b> the obligation to read the Megilla <b>on the fourteenth</b> of Adar, <b>which is</b> the fixed <b>time of its reading</b> for most people, although there are other times in which particular groups can read the Megilla. <b>Rabbi Yosei said: And that is so;</b> the proclamations about the shekels and about diverse kinds were certainly issued in Second Adar. Rabbi Yosei explains: <b>Didn’t they say</b> that the court would <b>proclaim about</b> the new <b>shekels</b> on the first of Adar <b>in order that Jews would bring their shekels in the proper time,</b> by the first of Nisan? <b>And if you say</b> that in a leap year the court issues this declaration <b>in First Adar, until then there are</b> still <b>sixty days of the year</b> before the first of Nisan. With so much time remaining, people might be lax and neglect to donate their half-shekels. Rabbi Yosei continues: Furthermore, <b>didn’t they say</b> that on the fifteenth of Adar the agents of the court <b>would also go out</b> to examine the fields <b>for diverse kinds</b> of food crops, to determine whether the farmers had in fact uprooted these plants, and to do so themselves if those farmers had neglected their duty. Was this <b>not</b> performed on this date <b>in order that the plants would be perceptible</b> at that time? The court agents must have gone out near springtime, as otherwise they would have been unable to detect the presence of diverse kinds. And <b>if you say</b> that this task is performed <b>in First Adar, until then</b> the new crops <b>are</b> too <b>small</b> to be seen. Consequently, they must have waited until Second Adar, when the crops were visible.",
                "The Gemara comments: In light of the statement that the proclamation concerning the new shekels was to ensure that the coins would arrive in the Temple at the proper time, <b>Rabbi Ḥizkiya asked</b> the following rhetorical question: <b>If that is so,</b> then with regard to <b>the residents of Babylonia,</b> who live at a distance of several months’ travel from Jerusalem, the court should <b>proclaim about the</b> new <b>shekels at the beginning of winter. Didn’t the court</b> make the proclamation <b>in order that the Jews would bring their shekels in the proper time, and</b> thus the <b>collection of the</b> Temple <b>treasury chamber</b> will <b>be collected from the new shekels at its appropriate time, on the first of Nisan?</b> It therefore would be necessary to issue the proclamation earlier for distant locations. <b>Rabbi Ulla raised a difficulty in the presence of Rabbi Mana:</b> Rabbi Ḥizkiya’s statement indicates that in each place the proclamation should be issued in accordance with the time it takes for the shekels to reach Jerusalem from there. <b>But we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 3:1): <b>On three occasions in the year</b> the shekels were <b>collected from the chamber,</b> for the purchase of offerings: <b>Half</b> a month before <b>[<i>biferos</i>]</b> the festival of <b>Passover, half</b> a month before the festival of <b><i>Shavuot</i>, and half</b> a month before the festival of <b><i>Sukkot</i>.</b> Rabbi Ulla continued and <b>said to</b> Rabbi Mana in explanation: In light of this mishna, <b>shouldn’t we say</b> that the proclamation for shekels was issued in all places on the same date, the first of Adar, whereas the ceremony of the collection of the Temple treasury chamber was performed at three different times, in accordance with the arrival of the shekels to the Temple from different locations: With regard to <b>those who are near</b> Jerusalem, whose shekels arrived before the first of Nisan, the collection ceremony for their coins is <b>half</b> a month before <b>Passover,</b> while the ceremony for <b>those who are farther</b> away is <b>half</b> a month before <b><i>Shavuot</i></b>; <b>and</b> the ceremony for <b>those who are</b> even <b>farther</b> away <b>than they are</b> is <b>half</b> a month before <b><i>Sukkot</i>.</b> <sup><b>[2b]</b></sup> Rabbi Mana <b>said to</b> Rabbi Ulla: The different collections of the chamber do not reflect the different times of the shekels’ arrival, but rather <b>the entire</b> collection of shekels <b>arrives at one</b> time, by the first of Nisan, and in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Ḥizkiya. <b>And why</b> then did the Sages <b>say</b> that the money is collected from the chamber <b>on three occasions</b> in the year? <b>In order to publicize [<i>pumbei</i>] the matter,</b> that everyone is obligated to donate half-shekels for the purchase of communal offerings.",
                "§ <b>Rabbi Yehuda bar Pazi</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: <b>Can we read</b> the following verses <b>and not be afraid?</b> On the one hand, when the Jewish people were asked to donate <b>for</b> the <b>good</b> purpose of the construction of the Tabernacle, the verse states: “And they came, both men and women, <b>as many as were willinghearted,</b> and brought…an offering of gold to the Lord” (Exodus 35:22). This indicates that only the generous among the people brought donations. On the other hand, when the Jews were asked to donate <b>for</b> the <b>evil</b> purpose of the Golden Calf, it states that not only the willinghearted but: <b>“And all the people broke off</b> the golden rings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron” (Exodus 32:3). A similar idea is found with regard to the people’s initiatives. When they initiated <b>for good,</b> at Sinai, it states: <b>“And Moses brought forth the people</b> out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount” (Exodus 19:17). This verse indicates that they did not venture forth on their own initiative, but only upon Moses’ instruction. In contrast, when it is <b>for evil,</b> the people took the initiative, as the verse states with regard to sending the spies: <b>“And you came near to me every one of you,</b> and said: Let us send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring us back word of the way by which we must go up, and the cities unto which we shall come” (Deuteronomy 1:22). Another example: <b>For good,</b> with regard to the song at the Red Sea after the Israelites were rescued from the Egyptians, it is stated: <b>“Then sang Moses and the children of Israel</b> this song unto the Lord, and spoke, saying: I will sing unto the Lord, for He is highly exalted; the horse and his rider He has thrown into the sea” (Exodus 15:1). They did not start singing of their own accord, but merely followed Moses’ lead. Yet <b>for evil,</b> after the spies delivered their report upon their return from Eretz Yisrael, the verse states: <b>“And all the congregation lifted up</b> their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night” (Numbers 14:1). <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said:</b> When he reproves the Jews, the prophet also notes their greater willingness to perform evil than good: “I said: Surely you will fear Me, you will receive correction; so her dwelling shall not be cut off, despite all that I have visited upon her; <b>but they rose early</b> and <b>corrupted</b> all their doings” (Zephaniah 3:7), which indicates that <b>every</b> act of <b>corruption that</b> the Jews <b>would perform, they would perform it early</b> in the day. In contrast, only the vigilant arise early to fulfill mitzvot. In reference to the previous statement that the Jews donated to both the Tabernacle and the Golden Calf, <b>Rabbi Abba bar Aḥa said: You cannot discern the</b> true <b>nature</b> of this people, as donations <b>are requested</b> for the Golden <b>Calf and they give;</b> and later, donations <b>are requested for the Tabernacle, and they</b> also <b>give.</b> In this regard, <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina taught this <i>baraita</i>.</b> The verse states: <b>“And you shall make an Ark cover of pure gold”</b> (Exodus 25:17). <b>Let the gold of the Ark cover come and atone for the gold of the Calf.</b>",
                "The Gemara returns to the issue of the collection of the shekels. <b>Rabbi Ḥaggai</b> said <b>in the name of Rabban Shimon bar Naḥman: Three collections are stated in this passage</b> (Exodus 25:1–3): <b>The collection for the sockets,</b> in which the beams of the Tabernacle building were placed; <b>the collection of shekels</b> for communal offerings; <b>and the collection</b> for the building <b>of the Tabernacle.</b> When the verse states: <b>“Speak to the children of Israel, that they take for Me an offering”</b> (Exodus 25:2), <b>this is the collection of sockets. “Of every man whose heart makes him willing, you shall take My offering”</b> (Exodus 25:2); <b>this is the collection of shekels. “And this is the offering which you shall take from them”</b> (Exodus 25:3); <b>this is the collection of the Tabernacle.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>The collection of the Tabernacle</b> goes <b>to the Tabernacle,</b> and <b>whatever</b> the authorities <b>want to do</b> with this money for the purpose of the Tabernacle <b>they</b> may <b>do. The collection of shekels</b> is <b>for</b> the communal <b>offering; whatever they want to do</b> with this money for the acquisition of the various communal offerings, <b>they</b> may <b>do.</b> Every Jewish male participates in this collection, <b>in order that they all have an equal</b> share in the communal offerings. As for <b>the collection of the sockets,</b> it is brought <b>for</b> the making of <b>sockets.</b> In this case the verse states: <b>“The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less”</b> (Exodus 30:15). Every male from age twenty upward donated the fixed sum of a half-shekel, which was used for the making of the sockets. <b>Rabbi Avun said: In this passage as well, three collections are stated: “Half a shekel for an offering to the Lord”</b> (Exodus 30:13); <b>“Shall give the offering of the Lord”</b> (Exodus 30:14); <b>“They give the offering of the Lord”</b> (Exodus 30:15).",
                "§ The mishna taught that <b>on the fifteenth</b> day <b>of the</b> month of Adar <b>the Scroll</b> of Esther <b>is read in cities.</b> The Gemara asks: But how can this be so? <b>Didn’t Rabbi Ḥelbo</b> say citing <b>Rav Huna</b> citing <b>Rav, in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great: All fulfill</b> the obligation to read the Megilla <b>on the fourteenth</b> of Adar, <b>which is</b> the fixed <b>time of its recitation.</b> This ruling apparently includes even the inhabitants of walled cities. The Gemara answers: This statement does <b>not come</b> to establish the correct date for reciting the Megilla, <b>but to teach you that all the</b> other <b>mitzvot that are practiced</b> in a leap year <b>in Second Adar are not practiced in First Adar.</b> The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Aḥa were sitting</b> together. <b>Rabbi Yosei said to Rabbi Aḥa:</b> The statement that all fulfill their obligation on the fourteenth indeed means that all may read the Megilla on the fourteenth. Yet <b>it is reasonable</b> to say so <b>only after the fact,</b> i.e., if they neglected to do so on the fifteenth, the inhabitants of a walled city have fulfilled their obligation by reading on the fourteenth. <b>However,</b> the residents of walled cities <b>may not</b> read the Megilla on the fourteenth <b><i>ab initio</i>.</b> Rabbi Aḥa raised an objection to Rabbi Yosei. <b>But wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In <b>a place where they were accustomed to read</b> the Megilla on <b>two days,</b> due to doubt over whether or not that city was surrounded by a wall in the days of Joshua (e.g., Tiberias; see <i>Megilla</i> 5b), <b>they read it</b> on <b>two days?</b> Yet you claim that even in a place where the Megilla must definitely be read on the fifteenth, if it was read on the fourteenth the residents are not obligated to read it again. Rabbi Yosei <b>said to him: I too hold like that,</b> i.e., that residents of a walled city should read the Megilla on the fifteenth, even when they had already read it on the fourteenth. Rabbi Yosei did not explain how Rabbi Ḥelbo’s statement that all fulfill their obligation on the fourteenth fits with the <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Mana said: And this is so;</b> there is no contradiction from the <i>baraita</i>. <b>If, after reciting</b> the Megilla on the fourteenth of Adar, one wants <b>to read it again on the fifteenth, perhaps we do not listen to him,</b> i.e., allow him? <b>If you say so, you have turned out to have directly uprooted</b> the proper <b>time</b> for the recitation of the Megilla in <b>walled cities,</b> which is the fifteenth of Adar. Therefore, it is appropriate for one who has already read on the fourteenth to read again on the fifteenth.",
                "<b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> All the <b>mitzvot that are practiced in Second Adar are not practiced in the First</b> Adar, <b>apart from</b> the prohibitions against <b>eulogy and fasting</b> on Purim, <b>which</b> apply <b>equally in both this</b> month and <b>that</b> one. It is prohibited to give a eulogy or to fast on the fourteenth and fifteenth of First Adar. <b>Rabbi Ba</b> said, citing <b>Rabbi Yirmeya in the name of Rav,</b> and similarly, <b>Rabbi Simon</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.</b> <b>Rav Huna the Great from Tzippori said: Rabbi Ḥanina instituted the custom in Tzippori in accordance with this</b> opinion <b>of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.</b> The Gemara infers: Rav Huna <b>did not say</b> that according to Rabbi Ḥanina the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, i.e., as a definitive ruling; <b>rather,</b> he meant that Rabbi Ḥanina merely <b>instituted the custom</b> in practice, even though it is not the definitive <b><i>halakha</i>.</b>",
                " <b>However, with regard to the issue</b> of dating legal <b>documents,</b> the following practice is followed. One <b>writes First Adar,</b> and in <b>Second Adar, simply</b> Adar. <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> In <b>First Adar</b> <sup><b>[3a]</b></sup> one writes <b>simply:</b> Adar, whereas in <b>Second Adar</b> one writes: <b>Second</b> Adar.",
                "§ The mishna taught that on the fifteenth of Adar <b>they repaired the roads</b> that were damaged in the winter, <b>and the streets, and the cisterns. And they did all that was necessary for public welfare.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>These are</b> the matters <b>necessary for public welfare: They judge monetary cases, capital cases,</b> and <b>cases</b> that involve the punishment <b>of lashes. And</b> the court also <b>redeems valuations, consecrations</b> of articles for Temple or priestly use, <b>and consecrations</b> for Temple maintenance or as offerings. <b>And they give the <i>sota</i> to drink, and they burn the</b> red <b>heifer,</b> to use its ashes for the ritual purification of those rendered impure by contact with the dead, <b>and they break the neck of the heifer whose neck is broken, and they pierce the ear of a Hebrew slave, and they render the leper ritually pure. And they remove the locks</b> that were placed <b>over the water</b> cisterns during the winter, as this water was for public use in the summer, <b>and they do not replace them</b> until the winter.",
                " <b>We learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>there</b> that although it is prohibited to perform unnecessary work on the intermediate days of a Festival, during these days <b>one</b> may <b>water an irrigated field, and one</b> may <b>mark the graves</b> by painting lime <b>on</b> them. The Gemara asks: But <b>didn’t</b> the court <b>already mark</b> the graves <b>in Adar,</b> as stated in the mishna here? Why was it necessary to mark them again during the Festival? The Gemara answers: It can <b>be explained</b> as referring to a situation <b>where a downpour rained down</b> after the graves were initially marked in Adar, <b>and washed away</b> the previous markings.",
                " The mishna further taught that on the fifteenth of Adar, agents of the court would <b>also go out</b> to inspect the fields <b>for diverse kinds</b> of food crops. The Gemara asks: But <b>didn’t they already go out in</b> the beginning of <b>Adar</b> to examine the fields for diverse kinds, as the mishna previously stated? The Gemara answers: It can <b>be explained that the year was late [<i>afila</i>],</b> i.e., the crops had not yet sprouted by the beginning of Adar, <b>and the plants are not perceptible</b> until later.",
                "§ The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is the obligation of <b>marking</b> graves derived? <b>Rabbi Berekhya</b> said in the name of <b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar bat Ya’akov in the name of Rabbi Ḥunya of Berat Ḥavrin, Rabbi Yosei said it</b> was <b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Aḥa, in the name of Rabbi Ḥunya of Berat Ḥavrin,</b> while <b>Rabbi Ḥizkiya</b> and <b>Rabbi Uziel, son of Rabbi Ḥunya of Berat Ḥavrin,</b> said it <b>in the name of Rabbi Ḥunya of Berat Ḥavrin.</b> These Sages said that the proof is from a verse: “And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and the hair of his head shall go loose, and he shall cover his upper lip, <b>and shall cry: Unclean, unclean”</b> (Leviticus 13:45). The Gemara explains: This teaches that one must take measures <b>in order that the ritually impure</b> object, in this case the leper, <b>calls to you verbally,</b> as it were, <b>and tells you: Separate</b> yourself from it. Just as the leper warns everyone that he is ritually impure, one must likewise mark graves to warn passersby of their impure status. <b>Rabbi Ila in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman</b> cited a different verse in this regard: <b>“And when they that pass through shall pass through the land, and anyone sees a man’s bone, then shall he set up a sign by it,</b> till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamon-gog” (Ezekiel 39:15). This verse explicitly states that there is a need to mark graves. The Gemara adds that further <i>halakhot</i> can be derived from this verse. <b>“Bone”: from here</b> it is derived <b>that one marks bones. “A man”: From here</b> it is derived <b>that one marks</b> a <b>spine and skull</b> that were found. <b>“Then shall he set up”: From here</b> it is derived <b>that one marks</b> the sign of ritual impurity <b>on a fixed stone,</b> for <b>if you say</b> that one may mark <b>on a detached stone, that very</b> stone is likely to <b>move</b> from that spot, <b>and</b> it will incorrectly mark <b>another place</b> as <b>ritually impure.</b> It is therefore necessary to use a stone that will not be moved. The verse further states: <b>“By it”:</b> This is referring <b>to a place of ritual purity.</b> In other words, the marking should not be placed on the spot of ritual impurity itself, but in a nearby, ritually pure location. <b>“A sign”: From here</b> we learn <b>of</b> the obligation to <b>mark.</b>",
                "It was further taught with regard to the same issue: <b>And</b> if one <b>found one marked stone, even though one should not establish it in this manner,</b> i.e., one should not mark a place of ritual impurity with a single stone <i>ab initio</i>, but with two stones in order to delineate the extent of the impurity, nevertheless, <b>one who covers it,</b> i.e., places some part of his body in the space above it, is rendered <b>ritually impure.</b> In such a case <b>I say,</b> i.e., one ought to assume: There was <b>a dead</b> body <b>marked</b> here, <b>and it was located underneath</b> this stone. However, if <b>there were two</b> marked stones, <b>the one who covers</b> them with part of his body remains <b>ritually pure,</b> as the source of impurity is typically located between, not underneath, the two markers. <b>And</b> consequently, if he covered the space <b>between</b> the stones, he is <b>ritually impure.</b> <b>And if there were plow marks between</b> these two stones, <b>they are</b> considered <b>like isolated stones</b> with regard to this <i>halakha</i>. Therefore, if he covered the area <b>between</b> the stones with part of his body he is <b>ritually pure, and</b> if he covered the space <b>surrounding</b> the area where they are set he is <b>impure,</b> as it can be assumed there was a source of impurity under each stone.",
                "<b>It was taught</b> in a different <i>baraita</i> that <b>one does not mark on</b> the location <b>of the flesh</b> of a corpse without any bones. Why not? <b>Perhaps the flesh has decomposed,</b> leaving less than the minimum size that confers ritual impurity by covering, which is an olive-bulk. If the mark is left there, the spot will permanently be treated as ritually impure. <b>Rabbi Yusta bar Shunem wondered in the presence of Rabbi Mana: And doesn’t he thereby render pure items ritually impure retroactively?</b> If the flesh is not marked at all, pure items might pass over the spot before the flesh has decayed, rendering them ritually impure. <b>He said to him: It is preferable that</b> people <b>are harmed by it temporarily,</b> while the flesh is still there, <b>and are not harmed by it permanently,</b> by wrongly thinking that their pure foods contracted ritual impurity from this source."

                " <strong>Halakha 2 · MISHNA</strong>  At the end of the last mishna it was stated that the court sends out agents on the fifteenth of Adar to inspect whether the owners of fields had indeed uprooted any diverse kinds of crops as instructed. <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: At first</b> those agents <b>would uproot</b> the diverse kinds of crops <b>and cast them in front of</b> the owners of the fields. <b>When</b> the number of <b>transgressors</b> who would not uproot diverse kinds in their fields <b>increased,</b> and the Sages saw that this tactic was ineffective, <b>they would cast</b> the uprooted crops <b>onto the roads.</b> Ultimately, <b>they instituted that the entire field should be declared ownerless.</b>",
                "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to what <b>Rabbi Yehuda said</b> in the mishna, i.e., that there were three stages of the Sages’ decree, the Gemara elaborates as it was <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: At first</b> the agents of the court <b>would uproot</b> the diverse kinds of crops <b>and cast them in front of</b> the owners, <b>and</b> those owners <b>would doubly rejoice. One</b> reason for their happiness was <b>that</b> others <b>were weeding their fields</b> for them, <b>and the</b> other reason was <b>that they would derive benefit from</b> these <b>diverse kinds,</b> which they would feed to their animals. The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>When</b> the number of <b>transgressors</b> who maintained diverse kinds in their fields <b>increased, they would cast</b> the uprooted crops <b>onto the roads,</b> so that passersby should trample on them and render them unfit for any use. <b>Even so,</b> the owners still <b>rejoiced that</b> those agents <b>were weeding their fields.</b> Therefore, the Sages <b>instituted that the entire field should be declared ownerless,</b> which would deter people from maintaining diverse kinds in their fields.",
                "The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that property declared ownerless by the court is</b> in fact <b>ownerless?</b> As the mishna states that the court rendered the fields ownerless, clearly they had the power to do so. What is the source for their having this power? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written,</b> with regard to the proclamation of Ezra and his court to all the people to gather in Jerusalem, where he instructed those who had married foreign women to divorce them: <b>“And that whosoever came not within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of the captivity”</b> (Ezra 10:8). This shows that the court has the power to render ownerless the property of anyone who violates its commands. The Gemara further asks: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> this ownerless field <b>is exempt from tithes,</b> like a field rendered ownerless by its owner? <b>Rabbi Yonatan, son of Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Aḥa, learned</b> the <i>halakha</i> of this case <b>from this</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One</b> may <b>not intercalate the year,</b> by adding the month of Second Adar, <b>neither in the Sabbatical Year nor in the year after the Sabbatical Year. And if they</b> transgressed and <b>intercalated it,</b> the year is <b>intercalated.</b> Rabbi Yonatan explains how exemption from tithes of a field that was declared ownerless by the court can be derived from this <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> yet with regard to that <b>one month that he adds,</b> i.e., the month to intercalate the year, which is added to the Sabbatical Year, <b>aren’t</b> the crops harvested in that additional month <b>exempt from tithes?</b> These crops are Sabbatical produce and as such exempt from tithes, but that status is only a result of the decree of the court to extend the year. This proves that the court has the power to render a field exempt from tithes. The Gemara continues to analyze the <i>baraita</i>. <b>Until here</b> it is clear why <b>the Sabbatical Year</b> should not be intercalated, as it extends the prohibitions of the Sabbatical year. However, <b>what is</b> the reason that <b>the year after the Sabbatical Year</b> should not be intercalated? <b>Rabbi Bun said:</b> The reason is so <b>as not to increase</b> the period <b>of the prohibition of new grain.</b> In the year after the seventh year people are still relying on the produce of the sixth year until the new crop sprouts in the spring of the eighth year. Since the food supply is liable to run out, the sooner the new grain can be eaten, the better. It is only permitted after the bringing of the <i>omer</i> offering on the sixteenth of Nisan, and therefore it is preferable not to extend the year, which would delay the beginning of Nisan. <b>Rabbi Ze’eira</b> says <b>in the name of Rabbi Elazar: That which you say,</b> that one may not intercalate the Sabbatical Year or the following year, applied <b>until</b> the time <b>that Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>permitted</b> one <b>to import vegetables from outside Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>to Eretz</b> Yisrael. Beforehand there was a danger of insufficient food, and the court needed to refrain from lengthening either year. <b>However,</b> from the time <b>when Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>permitted one to import vegetables from outside Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>to Eretz</b> Yisrael, and there was enough food for all, <b>the Sabbatical Year is</b> like <b>other years of the Sabbatical cycle,</b> i.e., it is permitted to intercalate any year.",
                "<b>It was taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that <b>one</b> may <b>not intercalate</b> the year following the Sabbatical Year. <b>Rabbi Mana said: This</b> matter <b>which you say:</b> It applied <b>at first, when</b> the seasons of <b>the years</b> proceeded in <b>their proper manner,</b> i.e., the new grain was ripe in time and could be eaten immediately after the sixteenth of Nisan. <b>However, now, when</b> the seasons of <b>the years do not</b> proceed in <b>their proper manner,</b> and the grain is not ready until later anyway, there is no problem delaying Nisan, so <b>the Sabbatical Year is</b> like <b>other years of the Sabbatical cycle.</b> The Gemara adds: <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the court <b>of the house of Rabban Gamliel intercalated</b> the year <b>immediately after the Sabbatical Year,</b> in the first month of that year. Rabbi Yonatan previously proved from the court’s ability to extend the Sabbatical year that the court has the power to declare property ownerless, to the extent that its produce is exempt from tithes. With regard to this, <b>Rabbi Avun said: If</b> your proof is <b>from this, you cannot learn anything from it.</b> Rabbi Avun explains: The Torah says: <b>“Observe [guard] the month of the spring,</b> and keep the Passover unto the Lord your God; for in the month of the spring the Lord your God brought you forth out of Egypt by night” (Deuteronomy 16:1). This means that one should <b>guard it</b> so <b>that</b> the month of Nisan <b>arrives in the</b> spring of the <b>new</b> year, i.e., in Nisan of the lunar year, which is roughly eleven days shorter than the solar year. If the festival of Passover is scheduled to arrive too early, due to the difference between the solar and lunar years, that year must be intercalated. Since the intercalation of the year is a Torah requirement, the extra month added to a Sabbatical Year is exempt from tithes by Torah law. Therefore, the extension of the year by intercalation is not merely a power of the court, and therefore cannot function as a source for the court’s power to declare property ownerless and exempt it from tithes.",
                "<b>But this</b> other mishna (<i>Pe’a</i> 5:1) <b>does state this</b> <i>halakha</i>, that a field declared ownerless by the court is exempt from tithes. With regard to <b>a pile</b> of grain <b>under which</b> gleanings <b>have not been gathered</b> by the poor, who are entitled to the lone stalks that fall during a harvest, <b>all</b> the kernels <b>that are touching the ground belong to the poor. And</b> about this mishna <b>Rabbi Ami said</b> <sup><b>[3b]</b></sup> <b>in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai,</b> who maintain that it is possible to declare an article ownerless exclusively with respect to the poor (see <i>Pe’a</i> 6:1). In defense of the attribution of the mishna to Beit Shammai the Gemara continues: <b>For if</b> the mishna is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel,</b> who maintain that the court cannot declare something ownerless only for the poor, then the <b>poor would</b> be allowed to <b>eat</b> the kernels touching the ground only after <b>tithing.</b> <b>And Rabbi Yosei said to him,</b> Rabbi Ami: <b>We learned</b> a different explanation whereby it is not necessary to attribute the mishna to Beit Shammai, i.e., <b>that everyone agrees</b> that this produce <b>is exempt from tithes because</b> the Sages imposed <b>a fine [<i>kenasa</i>]</b> on one who was careless enough to pile his grain on top of gleanings. He forfeits any stalks touching the ground, as they are rendered ownerless, and ownerless food is exempt from tithes. Since some of the kernels touching the ground are from the pile, not the gleanings, the ruling that they are all exempt from tithes depends upon the Sages’ power to declare them ownerless. If the mishna in <i>Pe’a</i> is understood in accordance with Rabbi Yosei’s opinion, it serves as evidence that the Sages can in fact declare property ownerless to the extent that its produce is exempt from tithes."

                "<strong>Halakha 3 · MISHNA</strong>  <b>On the fifteenth of</b> Adar, money changers would <b>sit</b> at <b>tables</b> set up <b>in</b> the rest of <b>the country,</b> outside the Temple, to handle the collection of shekels. <b>On the twenty-fifth of</b> Adar, the money changers <b>sat in the Temple. From</b> the time <b>when</b> the money changers <b>sat in the Temple,</b> the court <b>began to seize collateral</b> from those who had yet to donate the half-shekel. <b>From whom did they seize collateral?</b> From <b>Levites, Israelites, converts, and emancipated slaves.

The court <b>does not seize collateral from priests,</b> although they are legally obligated to give a half-shekel like all other Jews, <b>because of the ways of peace.</b> The mishna goes on to explain the status of priests with regard to the contribution of the half-shekel. <b>Rabbi Yehuda said</b> that <b>ben Bukhri testified in Yavne: Any priest who contributes</b> the half-shekel <b>is not</b> considered <b>a sinner,</b> despite the fact that he is not obligated to do so. Rabbi Yehuda added that <b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai said to</b> ben Bukhri: <b>Not so; rather, any priest who does not contribute</b> the half-shekel is considered <b>a sinner,</b> as they are obligated like all other Jews. <b>However,</b> Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai continued, <b>the priests</b> who do not contribute <b>interpret this verse to their own</b> advantage: <b>“And every meal-offering of the priest shall be wholly made to smoke; it shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 6:16). Those priests claim as follows: <b>Since the <i>omer</i></b> offering <b>and the two loaves,</b> i.e., the public offering of two loaves from the new wheat brought on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>and the shewbread</b> placed on the sacred table in the Sanctuary each Shabbat, which are all meal-offerings, are <b>ours,</b> then if we contribute shekels we will have partial ownership of these communal offerings, as they are purchased with the shekels. <b>How,</b> then, <b>can</b> they <b>be eaten?</b> They ought to be regarded as priests’ meal-offerings, which must be wholly burnt. But since these offerings are eaten, the priests concluded that they are not obligated to contribute the half-shekel. This argument does not, however, take into account the fact that communal offerings belong to the public, which is understood as its own entity, and are not regarded as shared offerings of all who contribute to the public purse.",
                "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna taught that the court <b>does not seize collateral from minors</b> for the half-shekel. The Gemara infers: This indicates <b>that</b> with regard to <b>claiming</b> the half-shekel from minors, the court does <b>claim</b> the money. The Gemara adds: <b>This</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>that you say,</b> i.e., that the court does not claim the money, applies <b>to</b> a young person <b>who has grown two</b> pubic <b>hairs</b> and therefore is legally an adult in other respects, but is not yet twenty years old. Before he is twenty he is obligated to donate the half-shekel only by rabbinic law, and for that the court does not seize collateral. <b>However, if he did not grow two hairs,</b> the <i>halakha</i> does <b>not</b> apply <b>to this</b> case and he has no obligation at all to contribute a half-shekel. The Gemara continues: <b>And</b> as for <b>seizing collateral,</b> the court <b>does not seize collateral</b> from a minor, <b>even if he grew two hairs,</b> until the age of twenty.",

This is also the meaning of the ways of peace mentioned in the mishna.",
                "The mishna further taught that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said</b> that ben Bukhri <b>testified</b> that any priest who contributes the half-shekel is not considered a sinner, to which Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai retorted that any priest who does not contribute is a sinner. <b>Rabbi Berekhya said: Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Zakkai’s source</b> is the following verse: <b>“This [<i>zeh</i>] they shall give,</b> everyone who passes among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the Sanctuary…” (Exodus 30:13). The word <i>zeh</i> has a numerical value of twelve, from which it is derived: <b>Twelve tribes shall give,</b> including the tribe of Levi, of which the priests are members. <b>Rabbi Tavi</b> said <b>in the name of Rav Hamnuna</b> that <b>the Rabbis respond in this way to Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who quoted Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Zakkai’s criticism of ben Bukhri’s opinion: The <i>halakha</i> is that <b>the sin-offering of an individual,</b> which for some reason cannot be sacrificed, must be left to <b>die,</b> by confining the animal in an enclosure and withholding food and drink from it. However, <b>a communal sin-offering</b> is <b>not</b> left to <b>die (</b>see <i>Temura</i> 16a). A similar distinction applies to meal-offerings: <b>The meal-offering of an individual may be entirely sacrificed</b> on the altar, e.g., when it belongs to a priest. <b>But a communal meal-offering,</b> i.e., the <i>omer</i>, the two loaves, and the shewbread, all of which come from the collection of shekels, <b>is not entirely sacrificed,</b> but is always eaten. If the priests are obligated to contribute the half-shekel, these meal-offerings will partly belong to them, and it is prohibited to eat the meal-offering of a priest. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> this is <b>difficult.</b> How could this question be presented against the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda? Can <b>one raise a difficulty against a person</b> from <b>a matter with which he does not agree? As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Yoma</i> 62b) <b>that a communal sin-offering</b> is <b>not</b> left to <b>die,</b> and yet <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: It is</b> left to <b>die.</b> According to Rabbi Yehuda there is no distinction between a communal sin-offering and an individual sin-offering in this regard. If so, there should likewise be no difference between communal and individual meal-offerings, and it should be possible to sacrifice the communal meal-offerings in their entirety. The Gemara adds: <b>And he,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>responds to</b> the difficulty of the Rabbis against his opinion: <b>Isn’t this</b> half-shekel given by a priest <b>an individual donation?</b> Since he is not obligated to donate the half-shekel, the contribution of a priest may be considered an individual donation, which separates it from the money of the rest of the community. For that reason, the communal offerings are not considered the property of the priests. <b>And</b> the Rabbis <b>respond to him that since</b> the priest’s half-shekel <b>has been handed over to the community, it is</b> considered part of the <b>communal donation.</b> The Gemara notes that there is another dispute of <i>tanna’im</i> along the same lines as this one. <b>It is written:</b> “This they shall give, <b>everyone who passes among them that are numbered,</b> half a shekel after the shekel of the Sanctuary” (Exodus 30:13). <b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya</b> disputed the meaning of this verse. <b>One</b> of them <b>said</b> that the verse means that <b>all who passed through the</b> Red <b>Sea</b> must <b>give</b> a half-shekel, i.e., the entire Jewish people. <b>And the other said</b> that <b>all who passed</b> before Moshe <b>to be numbered</b> must <b>give</b> the donation, whereas those who were not counted with the rest of the Jewish people, i.e., priests and Levites, need not provide a half-shekel. The Gemara comments: <b>The one who said</b> that <b>all who passed through the</b> Red <b>Sea</b> must <b>give</b> a half-shekel <b>supports</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Zakkai,</b> who maintains that the priests must also contribute, whereas <b>the one who said</b> that <b>all who passed to be numbered</b> must <b>give</b> the donation <b>supports</b> the opinion <b>of ben Bukhri.</b>"

                "<strong>Halakha 4 · MISHNA</strong>  <b>Although</b> the Sages <b>said,</b> as stated in the previous mishna, that the court <b>does not seize collateral</b> from <b>women, slaves, and minors,</b> as they are not obligated to contribute, <b>however, if they contributed a shekel</b> of their own accord, the Temple treasurers <b>accept from them.</b> Conversely, in the case of <b>a gentile or a Samaritan [<i>Kuti</i>] who contributed a shekel</b> to participate in the communal offerings, <b>they do not accept</b> it <b>from them. And</b> likewise, <b>they do not accept from</b> a gentile or a Samaritan <b>pairs</b> of birds sacrificed in the purification ritual of <b>a <i>zav</i>, pairs</b> of birds <b>of a <i>zava</i>, or pairs</b> of birds <b>of a woman who gave birth,</b> all of which are brought for ritual purification, <b>or sin-offerings or guilt-offerings.</b> <b>This is the principle:</b> With regard to <b>anything that can be</b> brought to the altar <b>as a vow or as a free-will offering,</b> the priests <b>accept</b> it <b>from</b> gentiles and Samaritans, and with regard to <b>anything that cannot be</b> brought <b>as a vow or as a free-will offering, they</b> may <b>not accept</b> it <b>from them. And this</b> principle <b>was similarly articulated by Ezra,</b> when he recorded the Jewish leadership’s rejection of the Samaritans’ request to assist the Jews in the construction of the Second Temple, <b>as it is stated:</b> “But Zerubbabel, and Joshua, and the rest of the heads of fathers’ houses of Israel, said unto them: <b>You have nothing to do with us to build a house unto our God;</b> but we ourselves together will build unto the Lord the God of Israel, as King Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us” (Ezra 4:3). <sup><b>[4a]</b></sup> The mishna states another <i>halakha</i>: <b>And these are</b> the people <b>who are obligated</b> in <b>the premium [<i>kalbon</i>],</b> a small sum added to the half-shekel collected: <b>Levites, Israelites, converts, and emancipated</b> Canaanite <b>slaves, but not priests, women,</b> Canaanite <b>slaves, or minors.</b> <b>One who contributes</b> a half-shekel <b>on behalf of a priest, on behalf of a woman, on behalf of a slave,</b> or <b>on behalf of a child, is exempt</b> from the premium, as they are exempt. <b>But if he contributed on his own behalf and on behalf of another,</b> i.e., he contributed one whole shekel to discharge both his own obligation and that of someone else, <b>he is obligated in one premium. Rabbi Meir says:</b> He must pay <b>two premiums.</b> The mishna further states: <b>One who gives</b> the collection agent <b>a <i>sela</i>,</b> i.e., a whole shekel, <b>and takes a shekel,</b> i.e., a half-shekel, as change <b>is obligated</b> in <b>two premiums.</b> <b>One who contributes</b> a half-shekel <b>on behalf of a poor</b> person, <b>on behalf of his neighbor, or on behalf of a resident of his city is exempt</b> from the premium. The Sages did not obligate in the premium those who use their own money to fulfill the obligation of another. <b>But if one loaned them</b> a half-shekel, rather than paying it on their behalf, <b>he is obligated</b> to pay the premium. Since the recipients of the loan must repay the money, it is as though the half-shekel were paid from their property rather than the lender’s. <b>Partnered brothers,</b> who have fully divided among themselves their late father’s assets, and <b>who,</b> if they jointly pay a whole shekel from those assets to discharge both of their obligations, <b>are obligated in the premium</b> like any other two private individuals, <b>are exempt from the animal tithe</b> for the livestock they inherited. Since they have completely divided between them all inherited assets, they are considered purchasers of the livestock, and a purchaser is exempt from the animal tithe. <b>But when</b> they have not completely divided the assets, and <b>they are</b> therefore <b>obligated in the animal tithe,</b> as the livestock is considered in their father’s possession, <b>they are exempt from the premium</b> for their joint payment, as in the case of one who pays on behalf of another. <b>And how much is a premium? A silver <i>ma’a</i>.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say:</b> It is only <b>half a <i>ma’a</i>.</b>",
                "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna taught that <b>although they said</b> that the assets of minors are not seized as collateral for the half-shekel payment, nevertheless, their money is accepted if they contribute it. The Gemara asks: The ruling that their money is accepted indicates that <b>with regard to claiming</b> their contribution, it <b>is not claimed</b> <i>ab initio</i>. However, the mishna’s statement <b>here,</b> that their property is not seized as collateral, indicates that <b>you say</b> that <b>it is claimed, and</b> yet <b>here,</b> at the end of the mishna, <b>you say</b> that <b>we don’t claim</b> the money. The Gemara answers that there are two different types of minors: <b>Here,</b> the statement of the mishna from which it can be inferred that the half-shekel is claimed from a minor is referring <b>to</b> one <b>who has two</b> pubic <b>hairs.</b> As the obligation to contribute the shekel is only fully in force at the age of twenty, a thirteen-year-old boy who has two pubic hairs can be referred to as a minor, even though he is considered an adult for other matters. <b>And here,</b> where it is stated that the half-shekel is not claimed at all from a minor, it is referring <b>to</b> a boy <b>who does not yet have two</b> pubic <b>hairs.</b>",

As</b> the Sages <b>disagreed</b> with regard to this matter: <b>A Samaritan is like a gentile;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: A Samaritan is like a Jew in all matters.</b>",
                "<b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> No, the statement of the <b>mishna</b> concerning obligatory offerings applies only <b>to gentiles, as</b> in this instance the mishna is <b>not</b> referring <b>to Samaritans.</b> The <i>halakha</i> with regard to Samaritans on this matter is subject to the general disagreement as to whether they have the status of Jews or gentiles. <b>And</b> indeed <b>it was taught likewise</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. It is written: “When a man of you brings an offering” (Leviticus 1:2). The phrase <b>“a man”</b> comes <b>to include converts,</b> as the verse does not specify the children of Israel. <b>“Of you,”</b> a restricting phrase, comes <b>to exclude apostates,</b> who have partially or entirely left Judaism. Hence, the Samaritans, who are classified as converts, bring obligatory offerings. The Gemara wonders: It appears that <b>the mishna disagrees with Rabbi Elazar,</b> as we learned: <b>Pairs</b> of birds offered in the purification ritual <b>of a <i>zav</i>, pairs</b> of birds <b>of a <i>zava</i>, or pairs</b> of birds <b>of a woman who gave birth are not accepted from</b> a gentile or a Samaritan. <b>But</b> this statement of the mishna is problematic: <b>Are there pairs of birds</b> offered in the purification ritual <b>of a <i>zav</i> or of a <i>zava</i> among the gentiles?</b> The <i>halakhot</i> of purification from ritual impurity do not apply to gentiles. The Gemara explains how Rabbi Elazar understands the mishna: <b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna, concerning the half-shekels, applies <b>to gentiles, and the latter clause,</b> which deals with obligatory offerings, is referring <b>to Samaritans.</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>it is so; the first clause</b> of the mishna is referring <b>to gentiles, and the latter clause</b> is referring <b>to Samaritans.</b>",
                "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> with regard to the Samaritans: <b>Initially,</b> during the construction of the Temple, <b>neither a specific article,</b> i.e., any item meant to be left intact, <b>nor a nonspecific article,</b> e.g., silver or a material that is incorporated into the structure and is not distinct, <b>is accepted from</b> gentiles or Samaritans. <b>Subsequently,</b> once the construction has been completed, <b>a nonspecific article is accepted from them, but a specific article is not accepted from them. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: Whether</b> it is <b>initially,</b> during the construction of the Temple, <b>or subsequently, neither a specific article nor a nonspecific article is accepted from them.</b> The Gemara wonders: <b>A <i>baraita</i></b> apparently <b>disagrees with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan: Consecrated</b> property <b>and donations for the maintenance of the Temple are not accepted from them.</b> This statement does not distinguish between the initial period of construction of the Temple and afterward, or between specific and nonspecific articles. The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yoḥanan would <b>resolve it,</b> and explain that the <i>baraita</i> indeed addresses the <i>halakha</i> of donations <b>both at the start and at the end</b> of the construction of the Temple, <b>but only</b> with regard to <b>specific articles.</b> Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> does not contradict the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan. It was stated above that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: Whether</b> it is <b>initially,</b> during the construction of the Temple, <b>or subsequently, neither a specific article nor a nonspecific article is accepted from them.</b> The Gemara wonders: <b>A <i>baraita</i></b> apparently <b>disagrees with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, as it was taught</b> (see <i>Arakhin</i> 5b): <b>All agree that</b> gentiles may <b>vow and be the subject of a vow.</b> A gentile who vows to donate his own value to the Temple and a Jew who vows to donate the value of a gentile must donate that sum to the Temple maintenance fund. This shows that pledges are accepted from gentiles, which contradicts the opinion of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish. The Gemara answers: Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish would <b>resolve it</b> by explaining that this <i>baraita</i> is referring to not the Temple maintenance but a vow to bring <b>a burnt-offering,</b> which all agree a gentile may do. The Gemara asks: <b>It works out well</b> that gentiles may <b>vow,</b> as this can be interpreted as speaking of <b>a burnt-offering.</b> However, the statement that gentiles can <b>be the subject of a vow,</b> if it is not referring to his value, cannot be dealing with the imposition of an obligation on a gentile to bring <b>a burnt-offering,</b> which would be the reverse case of a regular vow to bring an offering oneself. The reason is that a Jew has no means of forcing a gentile to bring an offering. The Gemara answers: <b>No;</b> this is not the correct interpretation of the mishna. <b>Rather,</b> the mishna is referring to a case <b>when a Jew said:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>a burnt-offering, and a gentile heard and said: What this</b> person <b>said</b> is likewise incumbent <b>upon me.</b> Since the gentile did not vow independently but tied his statement to that of someone else, it is considered as though a vow were uttered in reference to him. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if the mishna is referring to a burnt-offering, <b>doesn’t</b> the gentile <b>bring libations with it?</b> Burnt-offerings must be accompanied by libations. <b>And</b> the <b>surplus</b> money dedicated to libations <b>goes toward</b> the payment for the <b>sacred vessels.</b> It would therefore <b>turn out</b> that the gentile <b>brings a specific article.</b> <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Bun responded: But didn’t we learn</b> (see <i>Arakhin</i> 1:2), that according to Rabbi Meir, gentiles can <b>be valuated and</b> may <b>valuate</b> to the Temple the fixed sum of others, as prescribed by the Torah (Leviticus 27:1–8). The same question can be posed here: <b>Doesn’t</b> the sum valuated <b>go toward the Temple maintenance?</b> The gentile might end up donating a specific article. Rather, the explanation is <b>as they say there:</b> When a gentile pledges money to the Temple, <b>he intends it for Heaven,</b> for God in general, rather than for any specific use in the Temple, <b>and</b> the pledge <b>comes into the maintenance of the Temple</b> fund <b>on its own.</b> In other words, these items cannot be considered a direct gift of a specific article. <b>You</b> can <b>likewise say even here,</b> with regard to the surplus money from the libation of a gentile’s burnt-offering, that when he brings money for the libations, <b>he intends it for Heaven,</b> <sup><b>[4b]</b></sup> <b>and</b> the funds <b>come into the Temple maintenance</b> fund <b>on their own.</b> Consequently, it is permitted to accept the libations of a burnt-offering from a gentile, as the remaining money was never specifically designated for this purpose. <b>What does Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish do with this?</b> How can he reconcile his opinion that even nonspecific articles are not accepted from gentiles with the ruling of this mishna? He <b>explains that</b> the Temple construction was restricted exclusively to Jews, as the book of Ezra states concerning the Samaritans: <b>“You have nothing to do with us to build a house for our God;</b> but we ourselves together will build for the Lord” (Ezra 4:3). <b>Rabbi Ḥizkiya said that Rabbi Simon asked,</b> i.e., suggested: <b>Now,</b> since it has been concluded from the verse in Ezra that contributions are not accepted from gentiles for the maintenance of the Temple, it can be inferred from another verse that even contributions <b>toward the aqueduct,</b> which brought water to Jerusalem or <b>toward the walls of the city and its towers, are not accepted from them. As it is written that</b> Nehemiah said to Sanballat and the other gentile representatives: “The God of heaven, He will prosper us; therefore we His servants will arise and build; <b>but you have no portion,</b> nor right, nor memorial in Jerusalem” (Nehemiah 2:20).",
                "§ There is a dispute in the mishna with regard to one who contributes a whole shekel on behalf of himself and another. The first <i>tanna</i> maintains that he is obligated in one premium, while Rabbi Meir rules that he must pay two premiums. The Gemara quotes a <b><i>baraita</i></b> that clarifies the reason <b>for Rabbi Meir’s</b> opinion: <b>As Rabbi Meir said: Just as</b> one’s <b>shekel is</b> mandated by the <b>Torah, so</b> too, <b>his premium is</b> mandated by the <b>Torah. Rabbi Meir</b> therefore <b>holds, with regard to</b> one <b>who gives</b> exactly <b>a whole shekel,</b> half for himself and half for another, <b>that he is obligated in</b> one <b>premium</b> for each half. <b>As Rabbi Meir said:</b> When Moses was instructed in the <i>halakhot</i> of the shekel contribution, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, took out a kind of coin of fire from under His Throne of Glory and showed it to Moses and said to him: “This they shall give”</b> (Exodus 30:13), i.e., <b>like this</b> in volume and weight <b>they shall give</b> of metal. Since not all weights of coins are equal, and some coins might be slightly smaller than the one shown to Moses, it is therefore necessary by Torah law to add a premium.",
                "The mishna stated that <b>one who gives a <i>sela</i>,</b> i.e., a whole shekel, <b>and takes a half-shekel</b> as change <b>is obligated</b> to pay <b>two premiums.

The Gemara adds: This means that <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of Rav there are three premiums.</b> In support of this claim, the Gemara relates: When <b>Rabbi Yirmeya came,</b> he said explicitly that <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak</b> said <b>in the name of Rav: There are three premiums: One</b> for the <b>shekel that he gives, and one</b> for the <b>shekel that he receives, and one</b> that applies <b>by Torah law.</b>",
                "§ The mishna stated that a certain type of partnership between brothers renders them obligated in the premium and exempt from the animal tithe, while another form of partnership renders them obligated in the animal tithe and exempt from the premium. The Gemara elaborates: The case of <b>partnered brothers who are obligated in the premium and exempt from the animal tithe</b> is referring to <b>when they divided</b> up the estate of their deceased father <b>and</b> afterward <b>again established a partnership.</b> They are therefore partners in the normal sense, rather than co-owners of the original inherited estate, and regular partners are obligated in the premium and exempt from the animal tithe. The Torah specifically exempts partners from the animal tithe (see <i>Bekhorot</i> 56b). Conversely, the <i>halakha</i> <b>that they are obligated in the animal tithe and are exempt from the premium</b> is referring <b>to</b> brothers <b>who have not divided</b> their father’s estate between them at all. It is therefore considered as though their father were still the sole owner of the estate and is contributing the shekel for the pair of them. As stated earlier in the mishna, one who contributes his own money on behalf of another is exempt from a premium. Meanwhile, as the estate is under a single ownership, the animal tithe must be separated from the livestock.",
                "<b>Rabbi Elazar said: And this is</b> the <i>halakha</i> only <b>when they divided kids for goats and goats for kids,</b> i.e., when the two brothers inherited both kids and goats, and yet one took all the goats and the other all the kids. Since each originally inherited both species, this division is tantamount to one brother trading his goats for the other’s kids. When they again become partners, they are like strangers who join together. Consequently, they are exempt from the animal tithe. <b>However, if they divided kids for kids and goats for goats,</b> so that each takes some of both types in the normal manner, the <i>halakha</i> is that the group of animals each brother takes <b>is</b> considered <b>his share from the outset,</b> and no transaction between them has occurred. Consequently, when they reestablished the partnership, the estate reverted to its original status as a single entity, and therefore the animal tithe must be separated. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> No, <b>even if they divided</b> the estate in the manner of <b>kids for kids and goats for goats, they are</b> considered <b>like purchasers.</b> It is as though each brother has sold his share to the other, <b>and</b> they are therefore <b>exempt from the</b> animal <b>tithe, as we learned</b> in a mishna <b>there,</b> in <i>Bekhorot</i> (9:3): <b>That which is bought or given to</b> the owner <b>as a gift is exempt from the animal tithe.</b> The mishna spoke of two cases, one in which brothers are obligated in the animal tithe and exempt from the premium, and the other in which they are obligated in the premium and exempt from the animal tithe. In this regard, <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yirmeya raised a dilemma: And why do we not say</b> that there are also <b>times when they are obligated in both of them,</b> <sup><b>[5a]</b></sup> <b>and</b> there are <b>times when they are exempt from both of them? How is that?</b> If <b>they divided the property but did not divide the animals, they are obligated in both.</b> The brothers are considered regular partners with regard to the property, and they are therefore obligated in the premium. However, the livestock is still regarded as under the single ownership of their father’s estate, and they are therefore obligated in the animal tithe. Conversely, if <b>they divided the animals</b> between them <b>but did not divide the property, they are exempt from both.</b> With regard to the animals, the brothers are considered regular partners and are therefore exempt from the animal tithe. The rest of the property remains under unified ownership, and they are therefore exempt from the premium as well. In this regard, <b>Rabbi Mana said: This</b> statement <b>you,</b> Rabbi Yirmeya, <b>are saying,</b> that brothers who divided the property but not the animals are obligated in a premium, applies only <b>in</b> a case <b>where the animals were not the majority</b> of the property. <b>However, if the animals were the majority</b> of the property, <b>they are</b> considered the <b>principal property.</b> In this case, if the brothers have not divided the animals, even if they have divided the rest of the assets, it is as though they have not divided the estate at all, and they are therefore exempt from the premium. The mishna stated that if the brothers have not divided their inheritance between them, they are obligated in the animal tithe and exempt from the premium. <b>Rabbi Avin said</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimi raised a dilemma: Because you have</b> been stringent and <b>made them as one man with regard to the animal tithe,</b> by treating the estate as though it were under single ownership, will <b>you</b> also be lenient with them and <b>exempt them from the premium?</b> In this case too the stringent ruling should be accepted, and they should be treated as the owners of separate entities, who are obligated in the premium. Rabbi Avin <b>said to</b> Rabbi Shimi in response: Is <b>it not different?</b> There is a distinction here: <b>As he,</b> one of the brothers, <b>gives one whole <i>sela</i></b> from the estate on behalf of both of them, and as the inheritance has not yet been divided, the coin is still considered the legal property of the father. Consequently, they are exempt from the premium, despite the fact that this results in a leniency. The Gemara asks: According to the ruling that the undivided estate is considered under single ownership, <b>now</b> one could claim that <b>even if</b> the brothers <b>divided</b> the inheritance <b>and</b> subsequently <b>reestablished it again,</b> the inheritance should revert to its original state as their father’s property, and they should be <b>obligated in the animal tithe and exempt from the premium. And</b> yet <b>we learned</b> in the mishna that in this case <b>they are obligated in the premium and exempt from the animal tithe.</b> <b>Rabbi Ba</b> answered <b>in the name of Abba bar Rav Huna: It is</b> the same with <b>two brothers who inherited their father,</b> as <b>is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>two brothers-in-law who inherited their father-in-law.</b> If a father had only two daughters and their husbands inherited him, proceeded to divide up the inheritance, and later formed a partnership, they are considered like regular partners, who are obligated in a premium but exempt from the animal tithe. The same <i>halakha</i> applies to two sons.",
                "The Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the additional premium: <b>To where would the premiums fall,</b> i.e., what was done with them? <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> They would add them <b>to the shekels</b> themselves, for the daily and additional offerings. <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> They would be allocated <b>to free-will offerings,</b> i.e., the money would go toward the burnt-offerings that were sacrificed when the altar was idle. <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says:</b> They would use the premiums to buy <b>gold plating, and</b> this served as <b>covering for the</b> inner walls of the <b>house of the Holy of Holies. Ben Azzai says: The money changers</b> responsible for collecting the shekels <b>would take them as their payment</b> for their services, as they had to take time off from their regular work. <b>And some say</b> that the premiums were spent <b>on transportation expenses,</b> i.e., the cost of moving the shekels from their collection sites to Jerusalem.

The mishna adds: <b>Just as there were</b> collection <b>horns in the Temple</b> to receive the half-shekel contributions, <b>so too there were</b> collection <b>horns in the rest of the country,</b> i.e., areas outside of Jerusalem. The local inhabitants placed their half-shekels in these horns, which were later brought to Jerusalem. § With regard to <b>the residents of a town who sent their shekels</b> to the Temple <b>and they were stolen</b> from the agent on the way <b>or were lost, if</b> the <b>collection</b> of the chamber <b>had</b> already <b>been collected</b> before these shekels arrived, the agents must <b>take the oath</b> of a bailee <b>to the treasurers [<i>gizbarin</i>].</b> After the collection of the chamber, all the shekels that have been contributed become the property of the Temple, so the Temple treasurers who are in charge of this property become the opposing litigants of the agents. <b>If</b> the ceremony has not yet been performed and the contributions have <b>not</b> yet been collected into the baskets, the shekels are considered the property of the residents of the town, and therefore the agents must <b>take an oath to</b> absolve themselves to <b>the residents of the town.</b> Since those shekels are still considered the property of the residents of the town because the shekels never reached the Temple, they have not fulfilled their obligation.

                "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> It is taught in the mishna that residents of a town can exchange their half-shekels with gold darics in order to ease their burden on the way to Jerusalem. The Gemara asks: If the goal is to ease the agents’ burden by combining the coins into a more valuable commodity, <b>let them make them,</b> i.e., exchange them <b>with, gems [<i>margaliot</i>],</b> which are more valuable than darics and much lighter to carry.

                "§ It is taught in the mishna that just as there were collection horns in the Temple to receive the shekels, there were also collection horns in the areas outside Jerusalem. The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna</b> refers <b>to new shekels,</b> which are contributed for the new year commencing in Nisan. <b>However, with regard to old shekels,</b> which are brought by people who did not contribute in the previous year and are only now bringing their contribution for that year, the mishna is <b>not</b> addressing <b>this.</b> The collection horns for old shekels were located only in the Temple and not in other places. <b>And it was taught similarly</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Collection horns for <b>old shekels</b> exist <b>in the Temple,</b> but there <b>are no</b> collection horns for <b>old shekels in the rest of the country.</b> It is taught in the mishna that if the shekels were lost or stolen from the agent on his way to Jerusalem, he must take the oath of a bailee and is exempted. The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna</b> is referring <b>to</b> a case where the agent was <b>an unpaid bailee. However, with regard to a paid bailee,</b> it is <b>not</b> addressing this sort of case, since only an unpaid bailee is exempt through his oath from payment for loss or theft. <b>Rabbi Abba said: Even if you say</b> that our mishna is referring <b>to a paid bailee,</b> he is still exempt through oath, since the term <b>stolen</b> used in the mishna is referring to <b>armed robbers [<i>listim</i>],</b> and such a case is deemed an unavoidable accident for which even a paid bailee is exempt. The term <b>lost</b> means <b>like one whose ship sank in the sea;</b> he was saved, but the money he brought with him belonging to the residents of the town was lost with the ship. This too is deemed an unavoidable accident, for which even a paid bailee is exempt. It is taught in the mishna that if the shekels were stolen or lost by the agent after the collection of the chamber, the agent takes an oath to the Temple treasurer to prove that he was not negligent. <b>Rabbi Yustai, son of Rabbi Simon, said</b> that the mishna is <b>in accordance with the one who says that they</b> perform the <b>collection</b> of the chamber with the intention that the ceremony apply to money <b>that has</b> already <b>been gathered</b> but has not yet been brought to the Temple, <b>as well as to</b> money <b>that will be gathered in the future.</b> Therefore, any money that was in the agent’s hands at the time of the collection is considered the property of the Temple treasury. <b>However, according to the one who said that they do not</b> perform the <b>collection</b> of the chamber with the intention to include money <b>that has already been gathered</b> but has not yet reached the Temple, nor money <b>that will be gathered in the future,</b> but rather only money that is already in the Temple, <b>not with</b> regard to <b>this</b> did the mishna say that the agents take an oath to the Temple treasurers and are exempt. Since these shekels did not yet reach the Temple, it is as though they were not contributed at all, and all those whose shekels were lost or stolen must contribute another half-shekel in their place.",
                "§ It is taught in the mishna that if <b>the residents of the town sent their shekels</b> and they were stolen or lost, if the collection of the chamber had not yet been collected, the agents take an oath to the residents of the town; and if they have already been collected, they take an oath to the Temple treasurers. <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> The mishna is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon, as Rabbi Shimon says</b> that <b>consecrated items for which one is responsible</b> are considered <b>like his own property.</b> If a person consecrates an item as a vow, he takes on himself the responsibility to replace it if it is lost or stolen. Rabbi Shimon considers this responsibility to be a type of ownership, and therefore the agent who lost it must take an oath to the person who consecrated the lost item, who remains in some sense the owner. Similarly, the agent who lost shekels must swear to the residents of the town. The Rabbis who disagree with Rabbi Shimon maintain that consecrated items belong to the Temple, and therefore no oath is relevant, in accordance with the principle that one does not take an oath on consecrated items. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> disagreed with R. Elazar and <b>said:</b> The mishna <b>is in accordance with all</b> opinions. It is not limited to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, <b>due to</b> the fact that it is <b>a</b> rabbinically <b>instituted oath</b> not required by Torah law. Since people may claim that they have no responsibility for these items, the Sages instituted taking an oath on consecrated items as well. The Gemara asks: <b>According to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who holds that the oath mentioned in the mishna is a rabbinic ordinance, <b>it works out well</b> that if the shekels were stolen or lost by the agent after the collection of the Temple chamber was completed, the agent <b>takes an oath to the</b> Temple <b>treasurers. And if not,</b> if they were stolen or lost before the collections were collected, he <b>takes an oath to the residents of the town. And the residents of the town give other shekels</b> <sup><b>[5b]</b></sup> <b>in their place.</b> Although by Torah law one does not take an oath on consecrated items belonging to the Temple treasury, and therefore there is no need to take an oath to the Temple treasurers, this oath is required <b>due to</b> the fact that it is a rabbinically <b>instituted oath,</b> as the Sages required the agent to take an oath as the bailee of the consecrated property that was deposited with him. <b>However, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar,</b> there is a difficulty. It is reasonable that when the shekels are lost before the collection of the chamber ceremony, the agents must <b>take an oath to the residents of the town,</b> as <b>this is</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon.</b> As long as the collection of the chamber has not taken place, the residents of the town are held responsible for their shekels, since they are considered to be their property. But why does the agent <b>take an oath to the</b> Temple <b>treasurers</b> if the shekels are lost after the ceremony? With regard to the treasurers, <b>what is their purpose</b> in this discussion? One does not take an oath on consecrated items. The Gemara answers: The mishna means that the agents <b>take an oath to the residents of the town in the presence of the</b> Temple <b>treasurers so that</b> the treasurers will <b>not suspect</b> the residents of the town of not having given their shekels. <b>Alternatively,</b> even if the town residents are considered to be honest people who would not be suspected of withholding their shekels, the agents must take an oath in the presence of the Temple treasurers <b>so that</b> the treasurers <b>will not regard</b> the residents to be <b>negligent</b> people who failed to properly watch over the shekels. Rabbi Yoḥanan said that the oath mentioned in the mishna is a rabbinic ordinance. The Gemara comments: According to this opinion, the mishna’s statement that if the shekels were lost before the collection of the chamber ceremony, the agents must take an oath to the residents of the town applies <b>even if the residents of the town took upon themselves to pay</b> other shekels in place of the first ones that were lost or stolen. In such a case, the residents relinquished their right to an oath from the agent, but since it is in reality consecrated property, there is still a rabbinic ordinance that the agent <b>cannot discharge</b> his obligations toward <b>consecrated</b> property <b>without an oath.</b>",
                "Until this point the Gemara has dealt with a situation where the shekels were lost or stolen from the agent. With regard to a case where one <b>set aside his shekel and</b> subsequently <b>lost it</b> before the collection of the chamber ceremony took place, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> Since the collection of the chamber had not yet taken place, the shekel is considered to be the property of the donor, and <b>he is held responsible for it until he hands it to the</b> Temple <b>treasurer.</b> Therefore, he must replace the lost shekel. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: Consecrated items are</b> considered to be <b>in the possession of the Temple</b> treasury <b>wherever they are,</b> whether or not they have actually reached the hands of the Temple treasurer. Therefore, the donor is not responsible for replacing the lost shekel. The Gemara asks: <b>The mishna disagrees with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish,</b> as it teaches that <b>the</b> agents who lost the shekels <b>take an oath to the residents of the town, and the residents of the town contribute</b> shekels <b>in place of those</b> lost. Apparently, as long as the funds have not yet been collected, the shekels are considered to be in the possession of their owners. The Gemara answers: <b>Isn’t this also because</b> it is <b>a</b> rabbinically <b>instituted oath?</b> This oath is not by Torah law, but rather instituted by the Sages to encourage people to look after the shekels until they are brought to the Temple. According to Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, no oath is required by Torah law because the shekels belong to the Temple.",
                "It is taught in the mishna that if the shekels were stolen or lost by the agents and the residents of the town set aside other shekels as required, and then the first shekels were found or returned by the thief, both sets are considered to be consecrated shekels. <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The first ones are allocated to</b> the collection of <b>the new shekels,</b> from which the sacrifices of the coming year will be brought, and <b>the second ones are allocated to</b> the collection of <b>old shekels,</b> which are used to repair and maintain the Temple. The Gemara asks: <b>Which are the first ones and which are the second ones?</b> Are the first ones those that were lost, since they were contributed first, or are the first ones those that were contributed in place of the lost ones, and they are deemed so because they reached the Temple first? <b>Rabbi Pineḥas, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, and Rabbi Abba Mari</b> disagreed. <b>One of</b> them <b>said</b> that the first shekels are <b>those that the residents of the town first sent to the Temple, and the other one said</b> that <b>those that reached the hands of the</b> Temple <b>treasurers first</b> are considered the first shekels."

                "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> It is taught in the mishna that <b>one who contributes</b> his shekel from consecrated money, when the collection of the chamber ceremony takes place and the animal has been offered, he is guilty of misuse of consecrated property. The Gemara records two different versions of this <i>halakha</i>. <b>We learned in the mishna: If the animal was offered,</b> indicating that if the animal had not been offered, even if the collection of the chamber ceremony has taken place, he has not misused consecrated property. <b>The school of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>taught: If the collection</b> of the chamber <b>had been collected,</b> indicating that he is guilty of misuse of consecrated property even before the animal was offered. The Gemara asks: <b>Who is the <i>tanna</i></b> from Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s school who taught: <b>If the collection had been collected? It is Rabbi Shimon, as Rabbi Shimon said:</b> When one sold items to the Temple treasurers for use in communal sacrifices, such as fine flour for meal-offerings or wine for libations, <b>he would immediately receive his money</b> from the treasurers, <b>and the priests,</b> who <b>are vigilant</b> with regard to mitzvot, would ensure that the relevant items would not become disqualified. Since the items sold became consecrated right away, the money became non-sacred at the time of the purchase; there was no need to wait until the items were actually offered. Similarly with regard to the shekels, the moment the Temple treasury purchases an animal for communal sacrifices, the shekels used become non-sacred and the person who contributed his shekel from consecrated money is guilty of misuse of consecrated items. The mishna taught that if one gave his shekel to an agent to place into the collection horns and the agent placed it in for himself, if the collection of the chamber ceremony has taken place, the agent has misused consecrated property. The Gemara comments: <b>This is difficult. If one steals his fellow’s burnt-offering, and slaughtered it without specifying</b> for whom he was offering it, <b>isn’t the unspecified</b> offering considered to be <b>in the name of the original owners, and</b> doesn’t it <b>atone</b> for them? The same principle should apply here. Since the treasurer performs the ceremony of the collection of the chamber without having anyone particular in mind, this shekel should be attributed to the one to whom the shekel belonged and not to the one who stole the shekel for himself. If the agent receives no benefit from it, why is he considered to have misused consecrated property? <b>Rabbi Yudan said: It should be explained</b> as referring to a case <b>where</b> this shekel was a <b>particular</b> coin that stood out among the other coins in the collection basket, and the Temple treasurer noticed it and removed this coin in the name of the agent, just as the members <b>of the house of Rabban Gamliel</b> were accustomed to do. When one brought a half-shekel from the house of Rabban Gamliel to the Temple, <b>he would intentionally push it into the basket</b> in such a way that the treasurer would notice it and place it among the collected half-shekels. The Gemara comments why it must be the case that the person who illicitly contributed the shekel in his own name is liable for misuse of consecrated funds only if that particular coin is identifiably among those collected. Otherwise, wouldn’t one <b>be concerned and say that perhaps</b> the half-shekel given was not used to purchase offerings and instead <b>fell among the remaining</b> contributions in the chamber? And if this is the case, <b>is there misuse of consecrated property with</b> regard to the <b>remaining</b> contributions? According to the majority of the Sages, one is not liable for misuse of consecrated property for the remaining funds of the Temple treasury chamber. Should one <b>rather</b> explain the mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir? As Rabbi Meir says: One is</b> liable for <b>misuse of consecrated property with regard to the remaining</b> contributions of the chamber. The <i>halakha</i> is clearly not in accordance with R. Meir, as the majority rule otherwise, and the mishna does not indicate that it is reflecting a minority opinion. Therefore, <b>this too</b> is reasonable only if the mishna is addressing a noticeable coin like <b>the particular</b> coin <b>of the house of Rabban Gamliel, which</b> the treasurer <b>would intentionally collect in his name.</b> It is certain that it was included in the contributions collected for offerings, and therefore the agent is liable for misuse of consecrated property.",
                " The Gemara asks: <b>How did</b> the agent who placed the coin in the basket for himself <b>benefit,</b> that he should be liable for misuse? His goal was to perform a mitzva, and there is a principle that mitzvot were not given to derive benefit from them. We do not consider actions performed to fulfill a mitzva as personally beneficial to those who performed them. <b>Rabbi Avin said in the name of the Rabbis from there,</b> i.e., from Babylonia: <b>Since the court is liable to seize collateral from him and does not seize collateral from him,</b> it is <b>as if he benefited</b> personally from his action.",
                "The mishna seems to indicate that one who brings his half-shekel <b>from second-tithe</b> money has fulfilled his obligation, although he must eat non-sacred fruits in place of the second-tithe money. The Gemara asks: Since the money was already consecrated for a different purpose, it is not possible for a new sanctity to extend to it, <b>as it is written: “But the firstling which is born first to God among animals, no man shall sanctify it”</b> (Leviticus 27:26), and the Sages learn from the wording of this verse: <b>That which is already sanctified, no</b> other <b>sanctity can extend to it.</b> If so, <b>what does he do</b> so that the second-tithe money he contributed should count as his half-shekel? The Gemara answers: <b>He brings a <i>sela</i>,</b> i.e., a coin <b>of non-sacred money, and says: The second-tithe money,</b> already contributed, <b>wherever it may be, should be redeemed upon this <i>sela</i>. That <i>sela</i> assumes the status of second tithe,</b> which is transferred from the half-shekel that had been placed in the collection horn.

If one who was obligated to bring a sin-offering gathered together coins and said: <b>These are for my sin-offering,</b> then if he had accumulated more than was needed, <b>they agree that the leftover</b> money must be designated as <b>a free-will offering.</b> However, if he originally said: <b>That I will bring my sin-offering from these, they agree that the leftover</b> money <b>is non-sacred</b> property. <b>Rabbi Shimon said: What is the difference between shekels and a sin-offering?</b> Why do Beit Hillel say that the leftover money is non-sacred property in the case of shekels, while with regard to a sin-offering they say that the leftover money is consecrated for a free-will offering? <b>Rather,</b> the issue is <b>that shekels have a fixed</b> value, a half-shekel and no more. Therefore, there is a clear amount beyond which one did not intend the money to become consecrated property. However, <b>a sin-offering has no fixed</b> value. Since the entire sum that one collected could have been used to purchase a sin-offering, whatever he didn’t use must at least be designated for a free-will offering. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Even for shekels there is no</b> real <b>fixed</b> value. <b>For when the Jewish people ascended from the exile, they would contribute darics,</b> which are Median coins worth two shekels by Torah law. They brought these coins with them and would give a half of one to fulfill their half-shekel obligation. Later on, when the Median Empire was dissolved, <b>they reverted to contributing</b> with <b>a <i>sela</i>,</b> a silver coin of equal weight to the the shekel mentioned in the Torah. People would contribute a half-<i>sela</i> for their half-shekel requirement. When the value of this currency changed later on, <b>they reverted to contributing</b> with <b>a <i>tiva</i>,</b> a different coin which is worth a half-shekel. Some people <b>wished to contribute</b> only <b>dinars,</b> which are half the value of the <b><i>tiva</i>,</b> i.e., one quarter shekel in value. The Sages <b>refused to accept it</b> and required them to contribute at least the half-shekel mentioned in the Torah. Nevertheless, it is clear that the obligation of contributing shekels does not have a fixed value. <b>Rabbi Shimon said</b> in response: <b>Even so,</b> despite the fact that during different periods there were different amounts used to fulfill the obligation of the half-shekel, <b>everyone has equal standing,</b> i.e., at any particular time, everyone contributes the same amount. Therefore, any sum collected beyond that amount was not intended to be consecrated. <b>However, a sin-offering</b> has no fixed amount whatsoever; <b>this</b> person may <b>bring</b> an animal <b>worth a <i>sela</i>, and that one</b> may <b>bring</b> one <b>worth two, and this one</b> may <b>bring</b> one <b>worth three.</b> Therefore, it cannot be supposed that there was no intention to consecrate the whole sum.",
                "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> It is taught in the mishna: <b>One who</b> gathers together coins and says: These are for my shekel, if he finds that he has more than a half-shekel, then according to the opinion of Beit Shammai, the remainder is designated for a free-will offering, and according to Beit Hillel the remainder is non-sacred property. <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Elazar: With regard to what do they disagree? With regard</b> to <b>one who gathers coin by coin [<i>peroterot</i>],</b> adding small coins bit by bit until they amount to a large sum. It is assumed that he intended to contribute only a half-shekel but did not pay attention to the fact that a larger sum had accumulated. According to Beit Hillel, an item that was consecrated by mistake does not become consecrated, and thus the leftover money is non-sacred property. <b>However, with</b> regard to <b>one who</b> takes a stack of coins and <b>says: These are for my shekel, everyone agrees that</b> he must have intended to consecrate the entire sum. Therefore, the <b>leftover</b> coins <b>are</b> designated for <b>a free-will offering.</b> <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rabbi Beiva</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Elazar: With regard to what do they disagree? When one gathers coin by coin.</b> In that case Beit Shammai maintain that the leftover money is designated for a free-will offering. Since they hold that an item consecrated by mistake is in fact consecrated, all the money that he accumulated becomes consecrated property and must be designated as a free-will offering. However, with regard to <b>one who</b> takes a stack of coins and <b>says: These are for my shekel, everyone agrees that the leftover</b> coins <b>are non-sacred</b> property. Even Beit Shammai agree that he did not intend to consecrate a sum of money so beyond the requirement of the half-shekel <i>ab initio</i>. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya said: The mishna supports</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Beivai, as we learned in the mishna</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon said: What is the difference between</b> the leftover money from the <b>half-shekel</b> contribution, which is non-sacred property, <b>and</b> the leftover money for <b>sin-offerings,</b> which is designated for a free-will offering, <b>other than that shekels have a fixed</b> value <b>and a sin-offering has no fixed</b> value? The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> case <b>are we addressing? If</b> Rabbi Shimon is addressing the case <b>of one who</b> collects money in small amounts and <b>says</b> before he starts: <b>I will bring my shekel from these</b> coins, <b>everyone agrees that the leftover</b> coins <b>are non-sacred</b> property. <b>And if</b> he is addressing the case <b>of one who says: I will bring my sin-offering from</b> these coins, here too, <b>everyone agrees that the leftover</b> money <b>is non-sacred</b> property, as explained in the mishna. <b>Rather, this is the case we are addressing: when one</b> takes a stack of coins and <b>says: These are for my shekel.</b> Rabbi Shimon holds that with regard to <b>shekels, since their fixed</b> value <b>is</b> explicitly <b>from the Torah, the leftover</b> coins <b>are non-sacred</b> property, because even when he held all the money he intended only to take the value of a half-shekel from it. However, with regard to <b>a sin-offering, since it has no fixed value from the Torah,</b> as each person brings an animal of whatever value he wants, it is possible that one intended to bring an animal worth the entire value of the coins he took <i>ab initio</i>. Therefore, <b>the leftover</b> money <b>is</b> consecrated <b>for a free-will offering.</b> This is a proof for Rabbi Beivai’s opinion that when one takes a stack of coins and says: These are for my shekel, everyone agrees that the leftover money is non-sacred property. Rabbi Yosei understood the mishna such that when he says: These are for my shekel, everyone agrees that the leftover money is consecrated property. The Gemara asks: <b>What does Rabbi Yosei, in the name of Rabbi Elazar, do with this</b> proof? The Gemara answers: <b>He explains</b> Rabbi Shimon’s opinion in the mishna as <b>referring to one who collects coin by coin, and</b> it is <b>in accordance</b> only <b>with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel.</b> The Gemara challenges Rabbi Yosei’s version of Rabbi Elazar’s opinion: <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>The leftover shekels are non-sacred</b> property? This implies that in all situations where one consecrates shekels, including those where one said: These are for my shekel, the leftovers are non-sacred, which is in accordance with Rabbi Beivai’s explanation. The Gemara answers: There is no such implication. Rabbi Yosei <b>explained it as</b> limited to the case of <b>one who collects coin by coin, and</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel.</b> In such a case, the leftover money is non-sacred property.",
                "The Gemara discusses a different issue. When a person <b>sets aside his shekel and thought</b> at that point <b>that he is obligated</b> to contribute it, and <b>it turns out that he is not obligated</b> to contribute it, as he had contributed it already, the shekel that he separated <b>is not consecrated,</b> just as other mistakenly consecrated items do not become consecrated. With regard to <b>one who sets aside two</b> shekels simultaneously <b>and thought that he is obligated</b> to contribute <b>two,</b> one for the current year and one for the previous year, <b>and it turns out that he is obligated</b> to contribute <b>only one,</b> as he had in fact contributed the previous year’s shekel, <b>what do you do with the second one</b> that was mistakenly set aside? The Gemara answers. <b>Let us hear</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>from this</b> <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one set aside his sin-offering,</b> and at that point <b>he thought that he was liable,</b> as he had unwittingly sinned in such a manner requiring him to bring a sin-offering, and <b>it turns out that he was not liable,</b> the animal <b>is not consecrated.</b> If <b>one set aside two</b> animals <b>and thought</b> at the time <b>that he</b> had unwittingly transgressed two prohibitions and <b>was</b> therefore <b>liable</b> to sacrifice <b>two</b> sin-offerings, and <b>it turns out that he was liable</b> to sacrifice <b>only one, what do you do with that second</b> animal? It must <b>rather be left to graze.</b> On the one hand, it is consecrated with the sanctity of a sin-offering, but on the other hand, since the person who consecrated it is not obligated in another sin-offering, it cannot be sacrificed. Therefore, it must be left to graze until it develops a blemish and is disqualified from being offered. It can then be sold, with the proceeds used to purchase free-will offerings. <b>So too, these</b> mistakenly set aside half-shekels, i.e., in the case of one who set aside two half-shekels and in the end was obligated only to contribute one, <b>are</b> designated <b>for a free-will offering.</b> The Gemara rejects this comparison between the case of the extra shekel and the case of the extra sin-offerings. <b>Here,</b> in the case of extra shekels, <b>how can you say: These</b> are designated for a free-will offering? The mishna distinguishes between the leftover money when collecting shekels, which is considered non-sacred property, and the leftover money when collecting for a sin-offering, which is considered consecrated for a free-will offering.",
                "§ It was taught in the mishna: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that even the half-shekel does not have a fixed value, as over the course of history the exact sum of a half-shekel varied. Rabbi Yehuda then describes the coins used for the half-shekel during various periods. The Gemara first explains the mishna’s terminology. <b>Darics are</b> golden <b>dinars.</b> The phrase: <b>They reverted to contributing</b> with <b>a <i>sela</i>,</b> is <b>as it sounds;</b> i.e., the equivalent of the shekel mentioned in the Torah, which is four silver dinar. The phrase: <b>They reverted to contributing</b> with <b>a <i>tiva</i>,</b> refers to a <b>half-<i>sela</i></b> coin, the equivalent of two silver dinar. The phrase: <b>They wished to contribute</b> only <b>dinars,</b> refers to <b>a karat,</b> i.e., a quarter of a <i>sela</i>, or one dinar. The mishna continues: <b>They refused to accept it from them.</b> The Sages did not agree to accept dinars in place of the half-shekel. From where did the Sages derive this? <b>From this</b> verse: <b>“We made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the House of our God”</b> (Nehemiah 10:33). The third of a shekel cited in this verse is one-third of a daric, the prevalent coin of the time. Until that time, the custom was to contribute a half of the prevalent coin of the time. The Sages of that generation were concerned that over time the value of the prevalent coin would be reduced to the extent that people would no longer be contributing the value of the half-shekel of the Torah. The verse reports that they therefore set a minimum for the collection, which is the precedent for the Sages of the mishna not accepting the request to lower the fixed amount to a dinar. Once this verse is mentioned, the Gemara discusses other <i>halakhot</i> that are derived from it. <b>Rabbi Ḥilkiya</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Aḥa:</b> This verse is about the mitzva of charity. The term <i>shelishit</i>, one-third, used in this verse contains superfluous letters, as it could have been written <i>shelish</i> and maintained its meaning. <b>From here</b> one may derive <b>that a person must donate his shekel three times a year,</b> meaning that he must give a shekel to charity three times a year. One may also derive <b>from here</b> that <b>one</b> may <b>not burden the community</b> by asking them for charity <b>more than three times a year. Rabbi Avin said: From here,</b> there is also support for the fact that the baskets into which the collection of the chamber was collected were <b>three <i>se’a</i></b> in size; and <b>from here,</b> there is a hint to the <b>three collection baskets</b> and the <b>three collections</b> of the chamber during the year.",
                "<b>It is written: “This they shall give, everyone who passes among them that are numbered,</b> half a shekel after the shekel of the Sanctuary” (Exodus 30:13). <b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya</b> disagree with regard to the reason for the mitzva. <b>One said: Because they sinned</b> with the Golden Calf <b>at the midpoint of the day, they should give a half-shekel. And one said: Because they sinned at the sixth hour of the day, they should give a half-shekel, whose sum is</b> equal to <b>six <i>garmisin</i>,</b> a small coin that was prevalent in that period. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua of the house of Rabbi Neḥemya</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Zakkai: Because</b> the Jewish people <b>transgressed the Ten Commandments</b> at the time of the Golden Calf, <b>each one</b> of them <b>shall give ten <i>gera</i>,</b> which equals a half-shekel, as it is written: “This they shall give, half a shekel after the shekel of the Sanctuary; the shekel is twenty <i>gera</i>” (Exodus 30:13). Since the Jewish people violated the first commandment, it was as if they transgressed all ten (<i>Sifrei</i>, <i>Shelaḥ</i>). The Gemara cites an additional reason for the obligation to give a half-shekel: It atones for the sin of the sale of Joseph. First, it introduces this topic. <b>Rabbi Berekhya</b> and <b>Rabbi Levi</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: Since</b> the sons of Jacob <b>sold</b> Joseph, <b>the firstborn of Rachel, for twenty silver</b> dinar, the nation was commanded that <b>each of them</b> must <b>redeem his firstborn son with twenty silver</b> dinar, which is five <i>sela</i>, as there are four dinar in a <i>sela</i>. The Gemara returns to the subject of the obligation to contribute a half-shekel: <b>Rabbi Pineḥas</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Levi: Since</b> ten of Jacob’s sons <b>sold</b> Joseph, <b>Rachel’s firstborn, for twenty silver</b> dinars, <b>each of them received</b> two dinars, which amounts to <b>a <i>tiva</i></b> or a half-<i>sela</i>; <b>therefore, each and every</b> man <b>must give a <i>tiva</i> for his shekel</b> every year."

                "<sup><b>[6b]</b></sup> <strong>Halakha 4 · MISHNA</strong> <b>The leftover</b> money <b>from</b> what was set aside for <b>shekels is non-sacred</b> property, in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel in the previous mishna.

Shmuel <b>said to him: It</b> must be <b>allocated for</b> communal <b>free-will offerings.</b> Rabbi Yosei asked: If a High Priest set aside money to purchase fine flour for his meal-offering and then discovered that he had separated more than was necessary, what should be done with <b>the leftover</b> money from <b>his tenth of an ephah?</b> Shmuel answered that this is a matter of dispute, as <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said that he</b> must <b>cast it into the Dead Sea</b> and dispose of it there. <b>Rabbi Elazar said it</b> must be <b>allocated for</b> communal <b>free-will offerings.</b> The Gemara comments. <b>The mishna disagrees with Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> as it is taught: <b>The leftover</b> money <b>from the shekel is non-sacred</b> property. However, with regard to <b>the leftover</b> money <b>from the tenth of an ephah, the leftover</b> money <b>from the pairs</b> of birds <b>of a <i>zav</i> and</b> from <b>the pairs</b> of birds <b>of a <i>zava</i>, the leftover</b> money <b>from the pairs</b> of birds <b>of a woman after childbirth,</b> from <b>sin-offerings and guilt-offerings,</b> all of <b>this leftover</b> money must be used <b>for free-will offerings.</b> The mishna did not distinguish between different types of meal-offerings, so the High Priest’s meal-offering must also be included. However, according to the mishna, its leftover money is used for a free-will offering and not cast into the Dead Sea, as Rabbi Yoḥanan requires. The Gemara asks: <b>What does Rabbi Yoḥanan do with</b> the mishna? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>explains</b> that <b>it</b> is not referring to the leftover money of a High Priest’s meal-offering. Rather, it is referring to <b>the leftover</b> money <b>of the tenth of an ephah of the meal-offering of a sinner</b> among the <b>entire Jewish people.</b> Everyone agrees that the leftover money of this type of meal-offering must be used for a free-will offering; however, the leftover money of a High Priest’s meal-offering is cast into the Dead Sea.",
                "<b>Rabbi Yosei said: On this</b> point <b>Abba bar Ba raised</b> a difficulty. <b>As they,</b> the Sages of Babylonia, <b>said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> an animal that was designated for use as <b>the Paschal lamb,</b> <i>ab initio</i>, and was ultimately slaughtered before its proper time as a peace-offering is valid, as it <b>is transformed and designated as a peace-offering? The verse states: “If his offering for the sacrifice of the peace-offering is from the flock”</b> (Leviticus 3:6). This verse indicates that <b>any</b> offering <b>that</b> comes <b>from the flock,</b> i.e., sheep or goats, may <b>come as a peace-offering.</b> The verse is referring to a Paschal lamb, about which it is written: “You shall take it from the sheep or from the goats” (Exodus 12:5), and it must refer to one that was offered before its proper time; however, if it were offered on the eve of Passover as a peace-offering it would clearly be an invalid. Rabbi Abba bar Ba <b>raised an objection</b> with regard to this source: <b>A burnt-offering</b> also comes <b>from the flock,</b> and yet its leftover money is not used for a peace-offering; it is used for a burnt-offering. The Gemara answers: The verse is referring to <b>items that</b> may <b>come only from the flock;</b> this <b>excludes burnt-offerings, which</b> may <b>come even from cattle,</b> as it is written: “From the cattle or from the flock you may bring your offering” (Leviticus 1:2). Rabbi Abba bar Ba <b>raised</b> another <b>objection: A guilt-offering</b> comes only from the flock, and the mishna taught that its leftover money is used for a free-will offering. However, according to this explanation, it too should be able to be sacrificed as a peace-offering. <b>Rabbi Bun bar Kahana</b> said that the phrase <b>“From the flock”</b> indicates <b>that which comes from all</b> kinds in <b>the flock,</b> i.e., sheep and goats. This <b>excludes a guilt-offering, which</b> may <b>come from only rams.</b> The Gemara challenges Rabbi Bun. <b>In every</b> other <b>place you say that</b> the word <b>from</b> comes <b>to exclude</b> items from a particular category, <b>and here you say</b> that the word <b>from</b> comes <b>to include</b> the Paschal lamb, as “from” indicates all kinds of animals that can be considered part of a flock. The Gemara answers. <b>Rabbi Mana said:</b> In <b>this</b> verse <b>too, “from”</b> comes <b>to exclude.</b> One <b>exclusion</b> is that the Paschal lamb <b>may not come</b> from a lamb that is <b>two years old,</b> but rather from a lamb that is in its first year. There is an additional <b>exclusion</b> that a Paschal lamb <b>may not come</b> from a <b>female</b> animal, but only from a male. Accordingly, Rabbi Bun bar Kahana’s explanation that the verse: “If his offering is from the flock” is referring to the Paschal lamb, as it may come from any of the animals of the flock, is not based on the word “from” but rather on the superfluous letter <i>heh</i>, which adds the definite article to the phrase “the flock,” as opposed to the verse simply writing “a flock.” Rabbi Mana adds: <b>And</b> furthermore, even if Rabbi Bun bar Kahana would interpret the verse “If his offering is from the flock” <b>with regard to a guilt-offering</b> and not to a Paschal lamb, the word <b>“from”</b> would <b>also</b> come <b>to exclude.</b> It would teach <b>that</b> guilt-offerings may <b>come only from rams</b> and not from goats or female sheep. Rabbi Abba bar Ba <b>raised</b> another <b>objection</b> on the source of the Babylonian Sages. <b>Isn’t it written: “If his offering is from the flock, whether from the sheep or from the goats for a burnt-offering”</b> (Leviticus 1:10)? According to your opinion, this verse could just as easily be interpreted to indicate that in the case of any offering that comes from sheep or from goats, the leftover money must be used for a burnt-offering. However, <b>if so, the leftover</b> money <b>of the Paschal lamb,</b> which may come from sheep or from goats, must then <b>come as a burnt-offering</b> and not as a peace-offering. What indication is there that the concerning a peace-offering is the preferred one? The Gemara answers. <b>Rabbi Avun said: An item that is</b> designated <b>for eating,</b> e.g., the Paschal lamb, which is eaten by its owners, may be <b>transformed into</b> another <b>item that is</b> designated <b>for eating,</b> e.g., a peace-offering. However, <b>an item that is</b> designated <b>for eating,</b> like the Paschal lamb, may <b>not</b> be <b>transformed into another item that is not</b> designated <b>for eating,</b> such as the burnt-offering, which is completely consumed on the altar. <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Bun said</b> another answer: The status of <b>offerings of minor sanctity</b> may <b>be transformed and designated as</b> other <b>sacrifices of minor sanctity.</b> Therefore, the Paschal lamb, which is of minor sanctity, can be transformed and designated as a peace-offering, which is also of minor sanctity. However, the status of <b>offerings of minor sanctity</b> may <b>not be transformed and designated as offerings of the most sacred order,</b> such as a burnt-offering. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: On this</b> point, <b>Rabbi Ḥanina raised</b> an issue <b>that they,</b> the Sages of Babylonia, <b>said</b> that the status of <b>a Paschal lamb</b> that is not offered at the proper time <b>is not transformed and designated as a peace-offering, unless it was slaughtered as a peace-offering;</b> but if it was slaughtered for another offering, such as a burnt-offering, it is disqualified. However, <b>I say that even if he slaughtered it as a burnt-offering,</b> it may be transformed and designated as a peace-offering. <b>Rabbi Ila said: The reason,</b> i.e., the source, for the opinion <b>of</b> Rabbi Ḥanina quoted by <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> is the redundancy in the verse, as it is written: <b>“If his offering for the sacrifice of the peace-offering is from the flock”</b> (Leviticus 3:6). It could have simply written: If his offering of the peace-offering is from the flock. The extra phrase “for the sacrifice” indicates that a Paschal lamb slaughtered as <b>any</b> kind of <b>offering,</b> including a burnt-offering, <b>it comes</b> to be <b>a peace-offering.</b> The Gemara asks: According to this opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, may a Paschal lamb that was sacrificed as a burnt-offering be <b>transformed</b> and designated as a peace-offering even it was slaughtered with <b>a disqualifying intention?</b> If, during one of the services involved in an offering’s sacrifice, i.e., slaughter, receiving the blood, bringing it to the altar, or sprinkling it on the altar, the priest or the one bringing the offering entertains the thought of performing any of the other services or eating the offering at a time that is unfit, the offering is thereby invalidated [<i>piggul</i>]. The Gemara asks: <b>How was it done?</b> If <b>one slaughtered</b> the Paschal lamb <b>as a burnt-offering in order to sprinkle the blood the following day, in any case,</b> whether it is transformed and designated as a burnt-offering or as a peace-offering <b>it is disqualified.</b> The intention to sprinkle the blood at an improper time disqualifies the offering, so it does not matter whether it is transformed and designated as a peace-offering or not. The issue is whether one who eats an olive-bulk from the meat of this offering is liable to receive <i>karet</i>, like one who eats <i>piggul</i> meat, or whether he is not liable, like one who eats a regular disqualified offering. The principle is that an offering becomes <i>piggul</i> only when one slaughters an otherwise valid offering with an intention that disqualifies it. However, when the offering is disqualified for some other reason, the improper intention does not render the offering <i>piggul</i>. Therefore, <b>if you say</b> that even if one offers the Paschal lamb with <b>a disqualifying intention,</b> such as to sprinkle the blood the following day, <b>it is transformed</b> and designated as a peace-offering, and if not for the disqualifying intention it would be a valid offering, it is deemed <b><i>piggul</i></b> and one who eats the meat is liable to receive <i>karet</i>. However, <b>if you say</b> that when the Paschal lamb is offered with <b>a disqualifying intention,</b> it <b>is not transformed</b> and designated as a peace-offering, since it remains a Paschal lamb and it was sacrificed at the wrong time, then it is simply a disqualified offering, but not one that is <b><i>piggul</i>.</b> In that case, one who eats the meat is not liable to receive <i>karet</i>. This question remains unresolved.",
                "If one slaughters the Paschal lamb on Passover eve as a peace-offering, before the proper time for the Paschal lamb, it is transformed and designated as a peace-offering, and it is valid. However, if one slaughters it as a Paschal lamb, then it is disqualified, since it is not the proper time. The Gemara asks: What is the <i>halakha</i> if one slaughters it <b>for itself and not for itself,</b> meaning that at the beginning of the act of slaughtering one intends to slaughter it as a Paschal lamb, but at its conclusion he does so as a peace-offering, and it is not on Passover eve but <b>during the rest of the days of the year?</b> <b>Rabbi Bun bar Ḥiyya</b> said <b>in the name of Shmuel bar Abba:</b> During the rest of the year it has no name; it is not a Paschal lamb, as it is not its proper time, nor is it a peace-offering, as he did not consecrate it for that purpose <i>ab initio</i>. Despite this, if one slaughters it without specifying for which offering he is doing so, it becomes a peace-offering. <b>Since it has no name</b> in that case, then, by the same reasoning, even if one begins to slaughter it as a Paschal lamb, <b>it becomes as one who slaughters it for itself,</b> a Paschal lamb, <b>and not for itself,</b> a peace-offering, <b>silently,</b> without specifying his intention, <b>and it is valid</b> as a peace-offering. Just as total silence determines that it is meant to be for a peace-offering, so too, the explicit change of intention at the end of the slaughtering is sufficient to accomplish the same. One of the disciples <b>said to</b> Rabbi Bun: <b>If this is so,</b> that even when one begins to slaughter the animal with specific intent as a Paschal lamb it is transformed and designated as a peace-offering, then <b>even if one slaughters it for itself in order to sprinkle its blood not for itself,</b> but rather for a peace-offering, <b>it should become, from the first moment, as if he slaughtered it for itself and not for itself silently, and it too should be valid</b> as a peace-offering. <b>Rabbi Abba Mari said: What, shall we say,</b> i.e., is it so clear, that when one slaughters for itself and not for itself <b>silently,</b> without specifying his intention to sprinkle the blood for a peace-offering, that it is considered a valid peace-offering? <b>Or,</b> perhaps, <b>shall we say</b> that even when one slaughters silently with the intent to sprinkle its blood for a peace-offering, it is as if he specified that he is slaughtering for the Paschal lamb, in which case it is transformed and designated as a peace-offering and it is <b>disqualified?</b> The difference is that in the previous case there is not one entire part of the service that is completed for the Paschal lamb. However, in this case, the slaughtering is completed. It is only the intent with regard to a later stage, i.e., the sprinkling of the blood, that could possibly transform it and designate it as a peace-offering. That is not a sufficiently compelling logical extension.",
                "The mishna taught: <b>The leftover</b> money gathered by the <b>nazirite</b> beyond what he needs for his offerings must be used <b>for free-will offerings.</b> On this point, <b>Rav Ḥisda</b> <sup><b>[7a]</b></sup> <b>said: That</b> is only <b>when the</b> nazirite’s <b>sin-offering was sacrificed last,</b> after he offered his burnt-offering and his peace-offering. In that case, any extra leftover money must be used for a free-will offering, as taught earlier in the mishna. <b>However, if</b> he already brought his burnt-offering and sin-offering, and <b>the peace-offering was sacrificed last, the leftover</b> money that he set aside for his sacrifices must be used for <b>a peace-offering,</b> as with all leftover funds of peace-offerings. <b>Rabbi Ze’eira said:</b> This is not so. Rather, <b>even if the peace-offering was sacrificed last, there is one</b> consistent <b><i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai <b>with regard to the nazirite, that the leftover</b> money from that which he set aside for his nazirite offerings must be used for <b>free-will offerings.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>A <i>baraita</i> supports this one and a</b> different <b><i>baraita</i> supports that one. One <i>baraita</i> supports</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ze’eira,</b> as it was taught in a mishna (<i>Me’ila</i> 11b) that in the case of a nazirite who dies after he had set aside a lump sum for all his sacrifices, the money is to be used for free-will burnt-offerings. The <i>baraita</i> elaborates: <b>Which</b> coins <b>are</b> considered <b>unspecified coins? Any</b> money <b>that has money mixed in it for sin-offerings</b> whose owners have <b>died,</b> as when he set aside this money he specified that it would be used for all of his sacrifices, including the sin-offering. <b>And even if he had set aside the money for sin-offerings from</b> the rest of the money designated for the offerings, all the money <b>is</b> considered <b>unspecified money.</b> Once the nazirite dies, the money that he set aside is used for free-will offerings. Apparently, this applies even if he brought the peace-offering last. Therefore, this is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Ze’eira. <b>A <i>baraita</i> supports</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ḥisda,</b> as it was taught with regard to a nazirite who set aside money for his sacrifices and did not initially specify which coins were designated for which sacrifice, and then took some of that money and said: <b>This</b> money <b>is</b> designated <b>for my sin-offering, and the rest is</b> designated <b>for the rest of my nazirite</b> offerings, <b>and he died</b> before actually purchasing the offerings. The money designated for the sin-offering must be cast into the Dead Sea. With regard to the rest of the money, half must be used for burnt-offerings and half for peace-offerings. If one used the money that was designated for peace-offerings and burnt-offerings for his own purposes <b>he is guilty of misuse of consecrated property</b> only if he used <b>all the money,</b> as that certainly included the money designated for a burnt-offering. However, <b>he is not guilty of misuse of consecrated property</b> if he used only <b>some of it,</b> as it is possible that he used only the portion of the money that was meant for peace-offerings; one who uses that money is not guilty of misuse of consecrated property, since the meat of a peace-offering may be eaten by the owner (<i>Me’ila</i> 7b). Since the author of this <i>baraita</i> <b>did not say: If he died the money</b> must be <b>allocated for</b> communal <b>free-will</b> burnt-offerings, but rather that they are to be used for both burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, it seems that he holds in accordance with Rav Ḥisda; once the nazirite separated the money for his sin-offering from the rest of the money that he set aside, the leftover amount may be used for a peace-offering. This is not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Ze’eira, who holds that all the money must be used for free-will burnt-offerings.",
                "Since the Gemara mentioned the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the leftover money of a nazirite’s offerings, it discusses the leftover portion of his meal-offering as well. <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> With regard to <b>the leftover</b> portion <b>of a nazirite’s loaves,</b> i.e., if the nazirite set aside fine flour for his meal-offering and found that he had set aside more than was necessary, the rest of the fine flour must be <b>left to spoil.</b> Similarly, if he set aside money for his meal-offering and then found that he had set aside more than was necessary, he must cast the leftover money in the Dead Sea. <b>Rabbi Yosei said: And</b> Rav Ḥisda <b>is right. You cannot offer it on its own,</b> as <b>loaves are never brought</b> as an offering <b>on their own;</b> they are offered only along with a sheep as a burnt-offering or along with a ram as a peace-offering. <b>You cannot offer it with</b> the burnt-offering or peace-offering belonging to <b>another nazirite,</b> as <b>no</b> offering of a <b>nazirite is offered without loaves;</b> when the other nazirite took his vow upon himself, he obligated himself to bring his offerings along with his meal-offerings from his own funds, and he has no need for this leftover fine flour. <b>Therefore, one must say</b> that <b>the leftover</b> portion <b>of a nazirite’s loaves</b> must be <b>left to spoil,</b> as it has no other use. § When a nazirite set aside wine or money to purchase wine for his libations and there was more than necessary, the students of the study hall <b>thought to say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the leftover portion of <b>his loaves and</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the <b>leftover</b> portion <b>of his libations is the same,</b> and that the leftover portion of libations must also be left to spoil. <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Bun</b> said: <b>The leftover</b> portion <b>of libations</b> is different, as <b>it is an offering of the most sacred order</b> and therefore must be <b>allocated for</b> communal <b>free-will offerings.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Bun,</b> it becomes apparent that <b>three</b> Rabbis all said <b>the same</b> thing: <b>Shmuel, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ḥisda</b> with regard to the leftover portion of libations; <b>Rav Ḥisda</b> himself; <b>and Rabbi Elazar</b> all agree that the leftover portion of offerings of the most sacred order must be allocated to communal free-will offerings. The Gemara elaborates: The opinion of <b>Rav Ḥisda</b> is evident from <b>that which we have said.</b> Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Bun’s opinion that the leftover portion of libations must be allocated for free-will offerings is based on Rav Ḥisda’s opinion that only the leftover portion of a peace-offering is to be destroyed, but not the leftover portion of libations. This is due to the fact that they are offerings of the most sacred order. The opinion of <b>Shmuel</b> is evident, <b>as Rabbi Yosei said: While I was still there,</b> in Babylonia, <b>I heard the voice of Rabbi Yehuda ask</b> his teacher <b>Shmuel: If one set aside his shekel and died</b> before he contributed it to the Temple treasury, what is to be done with this money? Shmuel <b>said to him: It</b> must be <b>allocated for</b> communal <b>free-will offerings.</b> These shekels were used to purchase communal burnt-offerings, which are of the most sacred order. Therefore, it seems that the allocation of these shekels follows the same principle as do the offerings intended to be purchased with the shekels and the leftover money must be allocated for free-will offerings. The opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar</b> is evident from that which he <b>says</b> with regard to <b>the leftover</b> money <b>from</b> the High Priest’s <b>tenth of an ephah.</b> The High Priest would offer a tenth of an ephah of fine flour made into griddle-cakes daily, half in the morning and half in the evening. When the High Priest died during the day, half would be left over. The <i>amora’im</i> disputed what should be done with the leftovers: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: He</b> must <b>cast it into the Dead Sea. Rabbi Elazar says: It</b> must be <b>allocated for</b> communal <b>free-will offerings,</b> as it is an offering of the most sacred order."

                "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan was walking while leaning on</b> the shoulder of <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, and Rabbi Eliezer was watching him and hiding from him.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said: This Babylonian has done two</b> improper <b>things to me. One, he didn’t inquire after my welfare;</b> and <b>another, he is hiding</b> from me, as though he doesn’t want to speak with me. <b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi</b> tried to placate Rabbi Yoḥanan and <b>said to him: This is the custom among them,</b> i.e., among Babylonians. <b>The small,</b> less prominent people <b>do not inquire after the welfare of great,</b> prominent <b>people;</b> they only respond to them. That is the reason he did not inquire after your welfare. <b>Their custom is to fulfill</b> that which is written in the verse: <b>“The young men saw me and hid themselves, and the aged rose up and stood”</b> (Job 29:8). When Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi saw that Rabbi Yoḥanan was not mollified, <b>he said to him: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to passing in front of the Adura statue?</b> Does that fall into the category of giving honor to idolatry? Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: What honor are you giving it</b> by merely passing in front of it? <b>You could pass in front of it and blind its eyes,</b> meaning that you could pass in front of it and insult it. Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi <b>said to him:</b> If so, <b>Rabbi Eliezer was right not to pass in front of you,</b> since if he had passed in front of you but maintained the custom of Babylonians not to inquire after your welfare, it would have been a slight to your honor. Rabbi Yoḥanan continued: <b>That Babylonian did something else</b> wrong, in <b>that he did not say a <i>halakha</i> in my name,</b> as he repeated without attribution something I taught him. <b>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi entered.</b> In order to appease Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>they said to him: Rabbi, there was an incident</b> that occurred <b>in the synagogue of the weavers [<i>tarsiyyim</i>],</b> where they were discussing the halakhic status of <b>a door bolt,</b> a vertical bar that is affixed to the door in order to push into the ground, <b>which has a knob [<i>gelustera</i>] protruding at its top.</b> <sup><b>[7b]</b></sup> <b>Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yosei disagreed</b> about this issue <b>until</b> it reached a point <b>that they tore up a Torah scroll</b> in their anger. Before the Gemara resumes the story, it asks: <b>Could it enter your mind that</b> these Sages tore up a Torah scroll? <b>Rather,</b> it means that as each of them pulled it in his own direction, <b>a Torah scroll was torn.</b> The Gemara returns to the story told by Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi: <b>There was a certain old man,</b> one of the Sages, <b>named Rabbi Yosei ben Kisma,</b> and <b>he said: I will be surprised if this synagogue does not become a house of idolatry,</b> since the Sages say that whoever is angry should be in your eyes like an idol worshipper. The Gemara relates that although Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi thought that Rabbi Yoḥanan would be appeased after hearing this story disparaging anger between Torah scholars, Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>responded and said: This is</b> an incident <b>between colleagues.</b> How can you compare that to my situation, as Rabbi Eliezer is my disciple? <b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi entered before</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>and said to him</b> that <b>it is written: “As God commanded Moses His servant, so did Moses command Joshua</b> and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone from all that God had commanded Moses” (Joshua 11:15). From here it is evident that Joshua taught the Jewish people all of the Torah that he learned from Moses. <b>Is it possible</b> to conceive <b>that</b> with <b>every statement that Joshua made while sitting and expounding to the Jewish people</b> he would diligently <b>say: Thus said Moses?”</b> This does not seem plausible. <b>Rather, Joshua would sit and expound, and everyone knew that it is the Torah of Moses. Similarly, you,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, should know that <b>Eliezer, your disciple, is sitting and expounding before his own disciples, and</b> although he does not say so explicitly, <b>everyone knows that it is your Torah. Rabbi Yoḥanan said to</b> Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi, who had tried unsuccessfully to appease him: <b>Why is it that you do not know how to appease like ben Idi our colleague?</b>",
                "The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the reason that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan was so</b> insistent <b>that</b> people <b>say the <i>halakha</i> in his name?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Since even King David entreated God with regard to this</b> issue <b>to have mercy</b> on him, <b>as it is stated: “I will dwell in Your tent forever; I will take refuge in the covert of Your wings, Selah”</b> (Psalms 61:5). <b>Did David imagine that he would live and endure forever? Rather, this is what David said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe,</b> may <b>I merit that my words will be said in my name in synagogues and study halls,</b> and through this I will attain perpetual life for myself. The Gemara adds that <b>Shimon ben Nezira said in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak: Every Torah scholar from whose mouth people quote a matter of <i>halakha</i> in this world,</b> even after his death, <b>his lips move</b> along <b>with it in the grave, as it is stated: “And your palate is like the best wine…moving gently the lips of those that sleep”</b> (Song of Songs 7:10). <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>a mass of</b> heated <b>grapes, once a person places his finger on them,</b> they <b>immediately</b> issue <b>froth,</b> as the wine bubbles up and moves around, <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>the lips of the righteous, when people quote matters of <i>halakha</i> from the mouths of the righteous, their lips move with them in the grave.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What pleasure is there for</b> a righteous person when his lips move in the grave? Shimon <b>bar Nezira said:</b> He derives pleasure <b>like one who drinks spiced wine. Rabbi Yitzḥak said:</b> His pleasure is <b>like that of one who drinks aged wine.

                "<b>Rabbi Giddel said: One who quotes a teaching in the name of the one who said it should see</b> in his mind’s eye <b>the author of the teaching as if he</b> were <b>standing opposite him</b> at that moment, <b>as it is stated: “Surely man walks as a semblance”</b> (Psalms 39:7). When one thinks of another by quoting the Torah he taught, one should visualize the image or semblance of that person. On a related note, the Gemara continues. <b>It is written: “Most men will proclaim every man his own goodness”</b> (Proverbs 20:6). <b>This is</b> referring to <b>all</b> other <b>people,</b> meaning that most people will quote another person’s Torah thoughts without attributing them to their author. However, the verse continues: <b>“But a faithful man who can find?”</b> That is, who is faithful and accurate in reporting others’ teachings? <b>This is</b> referring to <b>Rabbi Ze’eira,</b> who took great care to maintain the accuracy of the tradition. <b>As Rabbi Ze’eira said: We need not concern ourselves with the traditions of Rav Sheshet, as he is an open-eyed man,</b> a euphemism for a blind person. Since he could not see his master’s face while studying with him, it is possible that he did not report his master’s words accurately. The Gemara relates another incident that illustrates Rabbi Ze’eira’s concern with the accurate conveyance of tradition. <b>Rabbi Ze’eira said to Rabbi Asi: Did the Rabbi,</b> i.e., Rabbi Asi, <b>know bar Petayya, that you quote teachings in his name?</b> Rabbi Asi <b>said to him:</b> I heard them from <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> who <b>said them in his name. Rabbi Ze’eira said to Rabbi Asi: Did the Rabbi,</b> i.e., Rabbi Asi, <b>know Rav, that you quote teachings in his name? He said to him:</b> I heard them from <b>Rabbi Adda bar Ahava,</b> who <b>said them in his name.</b>",
                "Having mentioned a verse in which David expressed a wish that after his death people would say teachings in his name in this world, the Gemara cites other requests by David. <b>There is no generation without scoffers. In David’s generation, what would the ridiculers of his generation do,</b> when they heard that David was not permitted to build the Temple and only his son Solomon would merit to build it? <b>They would go near David’s windows and say to him: David, David, when will the Temple be built? When will</b> we be able to say: <b>“Let us go to the House of the Lord”</b> (Psalms 122:1) as David himself had requested? <b>And David would respond</b> with a kind of oath: <b>Even though they intend to anger me, may</b> evil <b>come upon me if I do not rejoice in their words,</b> as I too want the Temple to be built soon, even if it means that I must leave this world before my time, <b>as it is written: “I rejoiced when they said to me: Let us go to the House of the Lord”</b> (Psalms 122:1). When David said this, God answered him: <b>“When your days are fulfilled and you will sleep with your fathers”</b> (II Samuel 7:12). This verse indicates that this is what <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to David: I reckon full days for you and not deficient days,</b> i.e., I will not deduct any days from your life. <b>Won’t Solomon, your son, build the Temple only in order to sacrifice communal offerings? The righteousness and justice that you perform are more pleasant to me than offerings, as it is stated: “To perform righteousness and justice is more acceptable to the Lord than an offering”</b> (Proverbs 21:3).

These funds, known as the collection of the chamber, are used to purchase animals for communal offerings and other needs of the Temple. These three occasions are: <b>Half a month,</b> fifteen days, <b>before Passover,</b> on the day before the first of the month of Nisan; <b>half a month before <i>Shavuot</i>,</b> on or around the twentieth of Iyar; <b>half a month before the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, on the day before Rosh HaShana. <b>These</b> three days <b>are</b> also <b>the due dates</b> that were established by the Sages <b>for</b> the setting aside of <b>animal tithes.</b> On each of these days one is obligated to tithe the animals that were born during the intervening period, and it is prohibited for him to eat or sell them until he does so. <b>This is the statement of Rabbi Akiva.</b> <b>Ben Azzai says</b> that the dates established by the Sages for the setting aside of animal tithes are <b>the twenty-ninth of Adar, the first of Sivan, and the twenty-ninth of Av.</b> <b>Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon say</b> that the dates for the animal tithes are <b>the first of Nisan, the first of Sivan, and the twenty-ninth of Elul.</b> <b>And why did</b> Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon <b>say the twenty-ninth of Elul and not the first of Tishrei,</b> as they said the first of Nisan and Sivan? <b>Because</b> the first of Tishrei <b>is</b> the <b>festival</b> of Rosh HaShana, <b>and it is not permitted to tithe on a Festival.

With regard to this word, <b>Rabbi Abbahu said: Wherever it is taught to us</b> in the mishna using the term <b><i>peras</i>,</b> which is from the same root as <i>bifros</i>, it means <b>half.</b> In this case it is referring to <b>half of the thirty-day</b> period <b>preceding</b> each of <b>the Festivals, when</b> lectures <b>on the <i>halakhot</i> of</b> the upcoming Festival <b>are delivered.</b>",
                "The mishna continues: <b>And these</b> three days when funds were collected from the Temple treasury chamber <b>are</b> also <b>the due dates</b> for animal tithes. With regard to this <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> Why did the Sages choose these specific times as the due dates for animal tithes? These dates were chosen <b>because they</b> mark <b>the birthing periods</b> of animals. Some animals give birth before Passover, others deliver only before <i>Shavuot</i>, and yet others have their young between <i>Shavuot</i> and <i>Sukkot</i>. The Sages fixed the tithing times to correspond to the periods during which animals usually give birth. <b>Rabbi Aḥa and Rabbi Tanḥum bar Ḥiyya in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> offered a different reason: <b>So that animals will be</b> readily <b>available for those going up</b> to Jerusalem <b>for the pilgrim Festivals.</b> The animals are tithed shortly before each of the Festivals so that there should be ample numbers of non-sacred animals ready to be sold for food and offerings to those on their way to Jerusalem. <b>Rabbi Yudan said:</b> The reason is <b>so that one should not come to</b> violate <b>the prohibition against delaying</b> an offering that he was obligated to bring to the Temple (Deuteronomy 23:22). If animal tithes would be due only after the Festival, three Festivals might pass without him bringing his animal tithes to Jerusalem to be offered, and therefore he would violate this prohibition. The Sages, therefore, established these days as the due dates for animal tithes so that they should serve as a reminder of the times by which the tithes must be brought to the Temple. <b>Rabbi Yosei said: Anyone who procrastinates</b> and fails to tithe <b>his untithed</b> animals at the proper time <b>transgresses the prohibition against delaying</b> bringing his offerings. <sup><b>[8a]</b></sup> The dispute in the mishna with regard to the third due date for animal tithes stems from a disagreement concerning the date of the new year for animal tithes. The Gemara now cites the various opinions about this matter. <b>We learn elsewhere</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>(</b><i>Rosh Hashana</i> 7b<b>): Rabbi Meir says: On the first of Elul</b> it <b>is the new year for animal tithes.</b> All the animals born prior to that date belong to the previous tithe year and are tithed together, whereas those born after that date belong to the next tithe year. <b>Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon say:</b> The new year for animal tithes is <b>on the first of Tishrei. Ben Azzai says:</b> The animals that are <b>born in</b> the month of <b>Elul are tithed by themselves,</b> separate from those born before the first of Elul and from those born afterward, which belong to the next tithe year. With regard to Rabbi Meir’s opinion that the new year for animal tithes is on the first of Elul, <b>Rabbi Ḥuna said: The reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir</b> is that he maintains that the new year for animal tithes begins on the first of Nisan, and the year to which an animal is assigned is determined not by its birth date, but by the date of its conception. Since the period of gestation of small livestock is five months (see <i>Bekhorot</i> 8a), <b>up to that time,</b> the first of Elul, <b>they conclude giving birth from the old,</b> i.e., from the animals that conceived before the first of Nisan. <b>From here on,</b> from the first of Elul, they begin giving birth from <b>the new,</b> i.e., from the animals that conceived after the first of Nisan. The Gemara explains the opinion of Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon, who maintain that the new year for animal tithes is on the first of Tishrei. <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Bun</b> said <b>in the name of Rav Ḥuna</b> that <b>the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon</b> is as follows. The verse states: “The flocks are clothed in the meadows, and the valleys are wrapped in grain; they shout for joy, they also sing” (Psalms 65:14). <b>“The flocks are clothed in the meadows,”</b> meaning the sheep have donned extra flesh, because they have conceived; <b>these are</b> the animals <b>that conceive early</b> in Adar and deliver by the first of Elul. <b>“And the valleys are wrapped in grain”: These are</b> the animals <b>that conceive late</b> in Nisan, when the grain has already grown and is clearly recognizable, and deliver only by the first of Tishrei. <b>“They shout for joy, they also sing”:</b> All the animals, those that are born early and those that are born late, become friends, <b>and they all enter the pen</b> together in order <b>to be tithed.</b> The Gemara proceeds to explain the opinion of ben Azzai. <b>Ben Azzai said: Since</b> the date of the new year for animal tithes is in doubt, as there are <b>those</b> who <b>say thus,</b> that it is the first of Elul, <b>and</b> there are <b>those</b> who <b>say thus,</b> that it is the first of Tishrei, the animals born in Elul cannot be tithed with animals born in another month, as perhaps they were born in a different tithing year, and one may not tithe animals from the new year for animals from the old year, or vice versa. Therefore, the animals that are <b>born in</b> the month of <b>Elul are tithed by themselves.</b> <b>How so?</b> If <b>five</b> animals <b>were born in Av and five in Elul</b> of the same year <b>and five in Tishrei</b> of the following year, <b>they do not join</b> together for tithing. Those born in Elul join neither with those born in Av nor with those born in Tishrei, as perhaps they were born in a different tithing year. All the more so those born in Av do not join with those born in Tishrei, as they were certainly not born in the same tithing year. If, however, <b>five</b> animals <b>were born in Tishrei and five in Av</b> of the same year, <b>they join</b> for tithing. The Gemara asks: <b>Does ben Azzai propose an intermediate position between the statements of his disciples?</b> These Sages being members of the next generation, one would have expected him to examine the reasoning behind their respective opinions and decide in favor of one of them. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya and Rabbi Meyasha came</b> and said <b>in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Rabbi Yitzḥak</b> to explain this difficulty: Ben Azzai did not rule in favor of either of his disciples because the matter about which they disagreed was the subject of an earlier dispute. For <b>the fathers of the world,</b> i.e., the great scholars of the previous generation, <b>had</b> already <b>differed on</b> this matter, and since ben Azzai was unable to decide between them, he adopted an intermediate position. The Gemara clarifies this assertion: <b>Who are these fathers of the world? Rabbi Yona taught in the presence of Rabbi Yirmeya:</b> This is referring to <b>Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva.</b> The Gemara notes: <b>That is to say</b> that the wording of ben Azzai’s statement: Since there are those who say thus, and there are those who say thus, indicates that <b>ben Azzai was</b> both <b>a colleague and a disciple of Rabbi Akiva.</b> Although he frequently appears as his disciple, he actually reached the level of a disciple-colleague. The Gemara asks: How is this evident? <b>If you say</b> that Rabbi Akiva was only his <b>teacher, is there anyone who says about his teacher: Since</b> there are <b>those</b> who <b>say thus, and</b> there are <b>those</b> who <b>say thus?</b> This wording implies that ben Azzai related to the disputants as equals, and this would have been inappropriate had ben Azzai only been Rabbi Akiva’s disciple, and so he must also have been his disciple-colleague. <b>Rabbi Avun in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak learned</b> that ben Azzai was a disciple-colleague of Rabbi Akiva <b>from the following:</b> After bringing two cases about which Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagree, the Mishna brings another case where Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel agree but Rabbi Akiva disagrees with the two of them. The Mishna then states that <b>ben Azzai said to</b> Rabbi Akiva: <b>We are</b> already sufficiently <b>troubled by the cases about which</b> Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel <b>disagree, and you come</b> now <b>to dispute</b> that <b>about which they agree. That is to say</b> that <b>ben Azzai was</b> both <b>a colleague and a disciple of Rabbi Akiva.</b> For <b>if you say</b> that Rabbi Akiva was only <b>his teacher, is there anyone who says to his teacher: And you come</b> now <b>to dispute</b> that <b>about which they agree?</b> Rather, infer from here that ben Azzai was also Rabbi Akiva’s colleague.",
                "§ The Gemara returns to the discussion of the new year for animal tithes. <b>We learned elsewhere</b> in a mishna (<i>Bekhorot</i> 57b): <b>All</b> animals <b>that were born from the first of Tishrei until the twenty-ninth of Elul</b> of the same year <b>join</b> together for tithing. If <b>five</b> animals were born <b>before Rosh HaShana and five</b> were born <b>after Rosh HaShana they do not join</b> together for tithing. If <b>five</b> animals were born <b>before</b> one of the three annual <b>due dates</b> for animal tithes, <b>and five</b> were born <b>after</b> those <b>due dates, they join</b> together. The due dates do not separate the animals into different groups, but merely establish the times when it is a mitzva to tithe them. <b>Rabbi Yosei said: This is to say</b> that <b>they did not make the animal tithe like</b> the tithe of fruit, whose obligation is determined by the time of the beginning of <b>the formation of the fruit,</b> as the parallel for animals would be the time of conception. They <b>also</b> did <b>not</b> make animal tithe <b>like</b> the tithe of grains and olives, whose obligation is determined by the time that those plants reach <b>a third</b> of their growth, as the parallel for animals would be the time that they are fit to be brought as offerings. The Gemara explains: <b>If you say</b> that the determining stage for animal tithes is <b>like</b> that for fruit, i.e., parallel to the time of the beginning of <b>the formation of the fruit, let</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> as follows: <b>All</b> animals <b>that were conceived from the first of Tishrei until the twenty-ninth of Elul</b> join together for tithing. And <b>if you say</b> that the determining stage for animal tithes is <b>like</b> that for grains and olives, parallel to the time that the latter reach <b>a third</b> of their growth, <b>let it teach</b> as follows: <b>All</b> animals <b>that were born before the twenty-second of Elul,</b> seven days before Rosh HaShana, join together for tithing. But animals born after that date are not fit to be brought as offerings that year, because an animal is not fit for the altar until it is eight days old. Therefore, they do not join together for tithing with the animals that were born earlier and are fit to be brought as offerings. Rather, the determining stage for animal tithes is the time of the animal’s birth. <b>Rabbi Shammai</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Beivai, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya:</b> This is not so, as in fact <b>they made</b> the animal tithe <b>like</b> the tithe of grains and olives, the obligation with regard to which is determined by the time that those plants reach <b>a third</b> of their growth. The mishna where it is taught that all animals born from the first of Tishrei until the twenty-ninth of Elul join together for tithing was <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, as Rabbi Shimon said:</b> An animal that is <b>lacking time,</b> i.e., it is less than eight days old, even though it cannot yet be brought as an offering, nevertheless <b>enters the pen to be tithed.</b> When <b>Rabbi Mana</b> heard this explanation he <b>arose</b> and discussed it <b>with Rabbi Shammai. He said to him:</b> Here <b>you say one thing,</b> i.e., that the mishna was taught in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, whereas <b>we learned elsewhere in the</b> mishna that <b>ben Azzai said:</b> The animals that are <b>born in</b> the month of <b>Elul are tithed by themselves</b> (<i>Bekhorot</i> 57b). Does he <b>not</b> refer to those born all month long, <b>even those that were born before the twenty-ninth of Elul</b> and will not yet be eight days old before Rosh HaShana? Now <b>can you say that ben Azzai’s</b> opinion <b>is in accordance with</b> the sole dissenting opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon and not with</b> the majority opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who maintain that an animal that is less than eight days old does not enter the pen to be tithed? Rather, it is reasonable to say that he does not disagree with the Rabbis, but he understands that even the Rabbis agree that an animal that was born on the twenty-ninth of Elul is tithed together with all the other animals that were born in Elul, even though it can be tithed in Tishrei only after it is eight days old. This indicates that the determining stage for animal tithes is the time of the animal’s birth. And how are the animals born at the end of Elul tithed according to the various opinions? Just <b>as you say according to</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis,</b> who maintain that the animals born from the first of Tishrei until the twenty-ninth of Elul of the same year are tithed together, as the new year for animal tithes is the first of Tishrei; still, those animals that were born during the last eight days of the year and cannot be tithed at the tithing period at the end of Elul because they are less than eight days old, <b>one puts aside until the next year, and they are tithed</b> together <b>with</b> other animals <b>of their year,</b> i.e., the previous year. <b>So you can say according to</b> the opinion <b>of ben Azzai:</b> Those animals that were born during the last eight days of the month of Elul, which one cannot tithe at the tithing period at the end of Elul since they are less than eight days old, <b>he puts aside until the next due date</b> in the coming Nisan, <b>and they are tithed</b> together <b>with</b> the untithed animals <b>that were born</b> at any time during <b>Elul</b> of the previous year. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya said: This is to say</b> that because it was concluded that even though an animal cannot be tithed until it is eight days old, its tithing year is determined by the day of its birth, we can infer from this that <b>the days during which a firstborn is lacking time,</b> i.e., when it is not yet eight days old, <b>count for</b> the reckoning <b>toward its</b> first <b>year.</b> The firstborn should be offered, or if it is blemished, slaughtered and eaten, during the first year of its life so that one does not mistakenly benefit from its wool or its labor. The year is calculated not from the eighth day of its life when it is fit to be offered, but rather from the day of its birth. <b>Rabbi Mana said in the name of Rabbi Yona: My father learned this from the following</b> verse: <b>“All the firstling males that are born</b> of your herd and of your flock <b>you shall sanctify</b> to the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 15:19). <b>How</b> is <b>this</b> verse to be understood? Seeing that a firstborn animal is sanctified from birth, why need one sanctify it? Rather, the verse comes to teach that <b>from the time of its birth you</b> begin to <b>count its</b> first <b>year</b> during which it should be eaten, and not from its eighth day when it becomes fit to be offered."

                "<strong>Halakha 2 · MISHNA</strong> The funds <b>are collected from the</b> Temple treasury <b>chamber with three baskets, each</b> measuring <b>three <i>se’a</i>. On</b> the baskets <b>is written,</b> respectively, <b><i>alef</i>, <i>beit</i>, <i>gimmel</i>,</b> based on the order in which the baskets are filled, to indicate from which basket coins should be taken to buy sacrifices. The coins were used in the order of their collection. <b>Rabbi Yishmael says:</b> The letters <b>written on them</b> were <b>in Greek, <i>alfa</i>, <i>beta</i>, <i>gamma</i>.</b> <b>The one who collects</b> the funds from the chamber <b>must not enter while wearing a cuffed garment</b> [<b><i>ḥafut</i></b>], <b>and not with a shoe, and not with a sandal, and not with phylacteries, and not with an amulet,</b> since all of these have places into which money can be inserted. The concern is that <b>perhaps</b> the one collecting the funds <b>will</b> one day <b>become poor, and</b> people <b>will say</b> that it is <b>because of the sin of</b> stealing the shekels of <b>the chamber</b> that <b>he became poor,</b> as they will suspect that he stole money and hid it in those places. <b>Or perhaps he will become rich and</b> people <b>will say</b> that <b>he became rich from</b> stealing <b>the funds of the chamber,</b> even though he did not actually do so. Even though one should not suspect someone of stealing consecrated shekels, the one collecting the funds from the chamber must nevertheless take these precautions, <b>as a person must appear justified before people just as he must appear justified before the Omnipresent [<i>HaMakom</i>], and it is stated: “And you shall be guiltless before the Lord and before Israel”</b> (Numbers 32:22). From here it may be inferred that it is not enough to be innocent before God; one must also be innocent before the Jewish people. Even in situations where there is little concern that one may commit a sin, the proper course is to remain above any possible suspicion of misconduct. <b>And the verse states: “So shall you find grace and good understanding in the sight of God and man”</b> (Proverbs 3:4).",
                "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna taught that funds are withdrawn from the Temple treasury chamber and collected into three baskets measuring three <i>se’a</i> each. The Gemara records another <i>halakha</i> that is learned from this. <b>We learned elsewhere</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 126b): On Shabbat <b>one may remove even four or five baskets</b> of straw or produce if the place they occupy is needed for guests or for students in the study hall. <b>Rabbi Ze’eira asked Rabbi Yoshiya: What is the measure of the baskets</b> that are permitted to be moved because the place that they occupy is needed? Rabbi Yoshiya <b>said to him:</b> <sup><b>[8b]</b></sup> <b>Let us learn</b> the measure <b>that is not clearly stated</b> with respect to the removal of baskets on Shabbat, <b>from</b> the measure <b>that is clearly stated</b> with respect to the collection of funds from the Temple treasury chamber. <b>For it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The funds are collected from</b> the Temple treasury <b>chamber with three baskets each</b> measuring <b>three <i>se’a</i>, which are nine <i>se’a</i></b> altogether, <b>which are twenty-seven <i>se’a</i></b> in total, as the collection of the chamber ceremony is performed on three different occasions over the course of the year. <b>And on</b> the baskets <b>is written,</b> respectively, <b><i>alef</i>, <i>beit</i>, <i>gimmel</i>.</b> The same <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>Why was <i>alef</i>, <i>beit</i>, <i>gimmel</i> written on the baskets? To indicate</b> which basket contained the shekels that were collected first. Therefore, the treasurer of the chamber would <b>supply himself</b> with shekels <b>from the first</b> basket, which was labeled <i>alef</i>, <b>before</b> taking the shekels from <b>the second</b> basket, which was labeled <i>beit</i>, <b>and from the second</b> basket <b>before</b> taking from <b>the third</b> basket, which was labeled <i>gimmel</i>. Rabbi Yoshiya’s answer to the original question is now clear: Just as the basket that was used to collect funds from the Temple treasury chamber, the measure that was clearly stated, measured three <i>se’a</i>, so too, the basket that may be removed from its place on Shabbat, the measure that was not clearly stated, measures three <i>se’a</i>.",
                "§ The Gemara brings another instance of a measure that is not clearly stated being learned from a measure that is clearly stated. <b>We learned elsewhere</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 76b): <b>One who carries out</b> undiluted <b>wine</b> from a private domain to a public domain or vice versa is liable only if he carries <b>as much as</b> is needed <b>for the dilution of the cup [<i>mezigat hakos</i>].</b> On this topic <b>Rabbi Ze’eira asked Rabbi Yoshiya: What is the measure of the cup</b> referred to in the mishna? Rabbi Yoshiya <b>said to him: Let us learn</b> the measure of the cup that is not <b>clearly stated</b> here <b>from</b> the measure of a cup that is <b>clearly stated</b> elsewhere. <b>As Rabbi Ḥiyya taught:</b> The <b>four cups</b> of wine <b>that</b> the Sages <b>said</b> one is obligated to drink on the first night of Passover together <b>contain a quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>of</b> raw <b>Italian wine.</b> Each cup of diluted wine must be a quarter-<i>log</i>. Since the proper ratio with regard to diluted wine is three parts water to one part raw wine, each cup of diluted wine contains three quarters of a quarter-<i>log</i> of water and one quarter of a quarter-<i>log</i> of raw wine. Therefore, the four cups together contain one quarter-<i>log</i>. From here it may be learned that one is liable on Shabbat for carrying out raw wine in the measure of one quarter of a quarter-<i>log</i>. <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Avin said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> That mishna dealing with the measure of wine for which one is liable if he carried it on Shabbat was taught <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda. For it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> addressing the prohibition against carrying on Shabbat: One who carries <b>water</b> on Shabbat from a private domain to a public domain or vice versa is liable if he carries <b>as much as</b> constitutes <b>a</b> single <b>swallow. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> He is liable if he carries <b>as much as</b> is required for <b>rubbing eye salve [<i>kilor</i>].</b> One who carries undiluted <b>wine</b> on Shabbat is liable if he carries <b>as much as</b> constitutes <b>a</b> single <b>swallow. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> He is liable if he carries <b>as much as</b> is needed <b>to be diluted in a cup.</b>",
                "The Gemara asks: <b>For what measure</b> is one liable if he carries wine that is already <b>diluted</b> from a private domain to a public domain on Shabbat or vice versa? <b>Let us learn it from this</b> <i>baraita</i>: One who carries <b>water</b> on Shabbat from one domain to another is liable if he carries <b>as much as</b> constitutes <b>a</b> single <b>swallow. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> He is liable if he carries <b>as much as</b> is required for <b>rubbing eye salve.</b> One who carries undiluted <b>wine</b> on Shabbat is liable if he carries <b>as much as</b> constitutes <b>a</b> single <b>swallow. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> He is liable if he carries <b>as much as</b> is needed <b>for the dilution of a cup. That is to say</b> that the measure for liability in the case of <b>diluted wine</b> is <b>as much as is in one diluted cup.</b> On the topic of the four cups of wine that are drunk on the first night of Passover, the Gemara asks: <b>What is the measure of</b> this <b>cup? Rabbi Avin said: One and a quarter <i>titreton</i>,</b> which is roughly equivalent to a quarter-<i>log</i>. The <i>log</i> was no longer a common measure, so Rabbi Avin offers its rough equivalent, using a more familiar one.",
                "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the ruling? May one <b>drink</b> all four cups <b>at once</b> [<b><i>bekherekh eḥad</i></b>], without interruption, or must there be some sort of interval between them? The Gemara answers: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that Rabbi Mana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei said</b> with regard to <b>the <i>hallel</i></b> that is recited on the first night of Passover, that <b>if one heard it in the synagogue</b> from the prayer leader, <b>he has fulfilled his obligation</b> to recite <i>hallel</i> and need not repeat it at home. <b>That is to say</b> that <b>if one drank</b> all four cups <b>at once</b> without interruption, <b>he has fulfilled his obligation.</b> One who heard <i>hallel</i> in the synagogue may omit the part of the <i>hallel</i> that is recited between the third and fourth cups, as he has already fulfilled his obligation. Doing so leaves no interval between these cups, yet Rabbi Yosei did not regard this as a problem, indicating that one is not required to have some sort of interval between the cups. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to drinking</b> the four cups of wine little by little, <b>with interruptions?</b> The Gemara answers: When the Sages <b>said that one must drink</b> four cups of wine, <b>didn’t</b> they institute <b>that he must drink</b> them, and <b>not that he should become intoxicated</b> from drinking them? Therefore, <b>if he drank them</b> little by little, <b>with intervals, he too</b> is acting in accordance with the will of the Sages, as he <b>is not becoming intoxicated,</b> and therefore he need not drink the entire quarter-<i>log</i> at once. The Gemara further asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to fulfilling one’s obligation</b> to drink four cups of wine on the first night of Passover <b>with wine</b> produced from grapes that grew during <b>the Sabbatical Year? Rav Oshaya taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One fulfills his obligation</b> with regard to the four cups <b>with wine of the Sabbatical Year.</b> The Gemara raises another question: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to fulfilling one’s obligation</b> to drink the four cups <b>with spiced wine?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>From</b> the fact that <b>bar Kappara taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>spiced wine is</b> treated <b>like wine, that is to say, one fulfills his obligation</b> with regard to the four cups <b>with spiced wine,</b> as it is wine. The Gemara asks yet another question: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to fulfilling one’s obligation</b> to drink the four cups <b>with diluted wine?</b> The Gemara answers <b>from what Rav Ḥiyya taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>the four cups</b> of wine <b>that</b> the Sages <b>said</b> one must drink on the first night of Passover, <b>one fulfills his obligation whether</b> he drinks them <b>undiluted or diluted, provided that they have the taste and appearance of wine.</b> Undiluted wine should not be so strong that it doesn’t taste like ordinary wine, and diluted wine must preserve the taste and appearance of wine even after the water is added. Having mentioned the desired appearance of the wine after it has been diluted, the Gemara notes that <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said: It is a mitzva to fulfill one’s obligation</b> with regard to the four cups <b>with red wine, as it is stated: “Look not upon the wine when it is red, when it gives its color in the cup,</b> when it glides down smoothly” (Proverbs 23:31). Having already taught that spiced wine is fit for the four cups, the Gemara cites what <b>we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Cooked wine is like spiced wine.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to fulfilling one’s obligation</b> to drink the four cups <b>with cooked wine? Rabbi Yona said: One fulfills his obligation with cooked wine.</b> The Gemara notes that <b>Rabbi Yona</b> conforms <b>to his</b> own <b>reasoning, since when Rabbi Yona would drink four cups of wine for Passover he would</b> have to <b>wrap his head</b> with a bandage <b>until the festival</b> of <i>Shavuot</i>, in order to relieve the headache that the wine caused him. This being the case, he permitted using weaker, cooked wine for the four cups.",
                " The Gemara relates that it once happened that <b>a certain</b> Roman <b>matron</b> [<b><i>matronita</i></b>] <b>saw that</b> Rabbi Yona’s <b>face was shining. She said: Old man, old man, one of three things must apply to you. You are either drunk with wine, or</b> else <b>you lend money at interest,</b> and owing to your comfortable income your face shines, <b>or</b> else <b>you raise pigs,</b> which provides you with large profits for little work. <b>He</b> cursed her and <b>said to her: Let despair come upon that woman, as none of these three things apply to me.

                " The Gemara further relates that <b>Rabbi Abbahu</b> once <b>came to Tiberias,</b> to the school of Rabbi Yoḥanan. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan’s students saw that</b> Rabbi Abbahu’s <b>face was shining. The students said to Rabbi Yoḥanan: Rabbi Abbahu has found a treasure.</b> When Rabbi Abbahu <b>came before</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: What new</b> words of <b>Torah did you hear? He said to him:</b> I heard <b>an ancient <i>Tosefta</i>,</b> which was new to me.

                "§ <b>Rabbi Ḥanin said: A <i>log</i> by Torah law is</b> equal in volume to <b>the old eighth with which</b> they would measure the <b>fish brine [<i>morayesa</i>] in Tzippori. Rabbi Yona said</b> to him: Even though the measuring instruments have changed and different ones are in use today, <b>I am familiar with that</b> measure, <b>as</b> it was <b>with that</b> measure that <b>the members of Rabbi Yannai’s household measured honey.</b> <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A quarter-<i>log</i> is equal to <b>half of a Tiberian eighth.</b> <sup><b>[9a]</b></sup> This is a measure that was used in the past, but no longer in the present. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This is our</b> measure today and it is not so old. The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> does the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>call</b> this measure <b>old when it was still</b> being used <b>in his day?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Some say that</b> this measure <b>was</b> originally <b>small and it was made larger, and some say</b> that after it was enlarged <b>it was</b> again <b>made smaller, but not as small as it had been</b> originally. Since this measure was not of the same size at all times, the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> was precise when he said that a quarter-<i>log</i> is equal to the old measure of one-eighth. So too, Rabbi Yoḥanan was precise when he said that this was the measure used in his day. The Gemara asks: In terms of the measures currently in use, <b>what is the measure of a cup</b> that holds a quarter-<i>log</i>? <b>Rabbi Yosei in the name of Rabbi Yosei ben Pazi and Rabbi Yosei bar Beivai in the name of Rabbi Shmuel</b> said: <b>Two fingers</b> long <b>by two fingers</b> wide <b>by the height of one and a half fingers and one-third of a finger.</b> The Gemara previously discussed the measure of wine that determines liability if one carries it from one domain to another on Shabbat. There, the Gemara discussed wine in liquid form; here, the Gemara adds a parallel ruling with regard to congealed wine. <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The measure that determines liability for carrying from one domain to another <b>congealed</b> wine is <b>an olive-bulk;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Natan.</b> <b>The Rabbis of Caesarea and Rabbi Yosei bar Beivai</b> said <b>in the name of Shmuel:</b> These words of <b>Rabbi Natan follow</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 76b). <b>Just as Rabbi Shimon said</b> there: The measure that determines liability for all liquids, including wine, is <b>a quarter-</b><i>log</i>, <b>so Rabbi Natan said:</b> When wine is in liquid form, the measure that determines liability for carrying it from one domain to another is <b>a quarter-</b><i>log</i>; <b>after it has congealed</b> one is liable only if he carries out <b>an olive-bulk,</b> which is equivalent to a quarter-<i>log</i> of wine after it has congealed.",
                "§ On a similar matter, <b>Rabbi Simon</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: An incident</b> is related <b>with regard to the mule of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>that died</b> of a wound, <b>and</b> the Sages <b>deemed its blood ritually pure,</b> i.e., free of the impurity <b>of an</b> unslaughtered <b>animal carcass.</b> They said that the blood of a carcass does not impart ritual impurity as does the carcass itself. <b>And Rabbi Eliezer asked Rabbi Simon,</b> who had reported this ruling: <b>Up to how much</b> blood from an animal carcass does not render one ritually impure? Did they deem it pure because it was less than a quarter-<i>log</i>, but had it been more than a quarter-<i>log</i> they would have deemed it impure? Rabbi Simon <b>paid</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>no attention</b> and did not answer him, so Rabbi Eliezer went <b>and asked Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, who said to him</b> as follows: <b>Up to a quarter-</b><i>log</i> of blood is <b>pure; more than a quarter-</b><i>log</i> of blood is <b>impure. Rabbi Elazar was displeased that Rabbi Simon had not</b> fully <b>reported the teaching to him,</b> so that he had to go to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi to ask about it. <b>Rav Beivai was sitting</b> and <b>teaching this case</b> of the mule from Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s household, in which the Sages ruled that the blood of a carcass does not render one impure. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Kahana</b> wished to clarify the issue and <b>said to him: Up to a quarter-</b><i>log</i> of blood <b>is pure,</b> but <b>more than that is impure?</b> Or did the Sages rule that the blood of a carcass is never ritually impure, whatever the measure may be? The Gemara relates: In response to Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Kahana’s question, Rav Beivai <b>kicked him. Rabbi Zerika said to him,</b> i.e., to Rav Beivai: <b>You kicked him because he asked you a question? He said to him: I kicked him because my mind was unsettled,</b> and not because he did anything wrong. Rav Beivai tries to explain his conduct: <b>As Rabbi Ḥanan said:</b> “And your life shall hang in doubt before you; and you shall fear night and day, and shall have no assurance of your life” (Deuteronomy 28:66). This verse in the passage of rebuke refers to three increasingly harsh levels of poverty: <b>“And your life shall hang in doubt before you”; this is one who buys wheat for a year,</b> who has no financial security with regard to the following year. <b>“And you shall fear night and day”; this is one who buys</b> small amounts of wheat <b>from a vendor,</b> with the attendant concern that he might not have enough for the morrow. <b>“And you shall have no assurance of your life”; this is one who buys</b> bread <b>from the baker</b> [<b><i>paltor</i></b>] and cannot afford to buy wheat in advance to assure even one future meal. Rabbi Beivai concluded: <b>And</b> I am in the harshest state, as <b>I rely on the baker.</b> For this reason I did not have the presence of mind to respond appropriately to Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Kahana’s question. The Gemara asks: <b>What then</b> is the halakhic ruling regarding the ritual impurity of the blood of an animal carcass? In response, the Gemara quotes a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 8:1): <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Petora testified that the blood of an</b> unslaughtered <b>animal carcass is ritually pure,</b> which implies that it is ritually pure regardless of the amount, even more than a quarter-<i>log</i>. The Gemara rejects this answer: <b>What</b> does the mishna mean by <b>ritually pure?</b> That such blood is <b>ritually pure</b> in that it does not <b>render</b> an item <b>susceptible</b> to impurity. Even though blood is one of the seven liquids that render an item susceptible to ritual impurity, the blood of an animal carcass is not deemed blood for this purpose. <b>But as for imparting ritual impurity</b> by itself, the blood <b>imparts ritual impurity,</b> as does the carcass itself. The Gemara asks: How can the words of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Petora be understood in this way? Didn’t <b>we learn elsewhere in a mishna</b> (<i>Makhshirin</i> 6:5): <b>The blood of a creeping animal is like its flesh; it imparts ritual impurity</b> to items with which it comes into contact, but <b>it does not render</b> an item <b>susceptible</b> to impurity? <b>And we have nothing</b> else <b>like it,</b> i.e., there is no other liquid that imparts ritual impurity but does not render food susceptible to impurity. The implication is that the blood of an animal carcass would either both impart impurity and render an item susceptible to impurity or neither. The Gemara answers: When the mishna said that we have nothing else like a creeping animal, it meant that we have nothing else like it with regard to the measure required for its blood to confer impurity; the measure of a creeping animal’s blood is the same for both: <b>The measure</b> required for <b>its imparting ritual impurity</b> is such <b>that its blood imparts ritual impurity like its flesh,</b> i.e., in the measure of a lentil. This is not the case with an unslaughtered animal carcass, the flesh of which imparts ritual impurity in the measure of an olive-bulk, while its blood imparts impurity in the measure of a quarter-<i>log</i>. Consequently, there is no contradiction between the mishna in tractate <i>Makhshirin</i> and the testimony of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Petora. <b>Rabbi Yosei said: Two <i>amora’im</i> disagree about this</b> matter. <b>One said</b> a quarter-<i>log</i> of this blood renders one <b>ritually impure, and one said</b> that even after contact with this blood, one remains <b>ritually pure.

Rabbi Yehuda maintains there that this issue is the subject of a dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel. The <i>halakha</i> would follow the opinion of Beit Hillel, which is that carcass blood does confer impurity. <b>And the one who said ritually pure</b> holds <b>like</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Petora,</b> who testified (<i>Eduyyot</i> 8:1) that the blood of an animal carcass is ritually pure. <b>Rav Avduma of the descenders,</b> i.e., travelers from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, bringing with them the Torah taught in Eretz Yisrael, <b>said to him: And it is right.</b> That which you explained is correct, <b>as Rabbi Yehuda was the halakhic authority for the house of the <i>Nasi</i>.</b> Rabbi Yehuda ruled then that the blood of the dead mule was pure only because there was less than a quarter-<i>log</i> of it.",

                "<strong>Halakha 3 · MISHNA</strong> In order to indicate the importance that was attached to the ceremony of the collection of the Temple treasury chamber, the mishna relates that the members <b>of the house of Rabban Gamliel</b> desired that their shekels be the ones collected from the chamber and used for the purchase of the communal offerings. Each of them <b>would</b> therefore come to the Temple specifically on the day of the ceremony of the collection of the chamber, <b>enter</b> the chamber <b>with his shekel between his fingers, and toss it in front of the one collecting</b> the money so that he would see it and place it in the basket containing the money to be taken out of the chamber. Understanding what was happening, <b>the one collecting</b> the money from the chamber <b>would purposely push</b> this shekel <b>into the basket,</b> so that it would later be used to buy communal offerings. <b>The one collecting</b> the funds from the chamber may <b>not</b> begin to <b>collect</b> the money <b>until he asks</b> the Temple treasurers three times: <b>Shall I collect</b> the funds, <b>and they say to him: Collect</b> them, <b>collect</b> them, <b>collect</b> them, <b>three times.</b> The coins were stored in the Temple treasury in three large baskets, each measuring nine <i>se’a</i>. In the collection of the chamber ceremony, coins were removed from these baskets and placed in smaller baskets of three <i>se’a</i> each that were marked with letters (see the previous mishna on <i>daf</i> 8a). After <b>he collected the</b> funds <b>from the first</b> large basket and put them into one of the smaller baskets labeled with the letter <i>alef</i>, <b>he</b> immediately <b>covered with a leather cover</b> the large basket from which he had removed the money. After collecting funds <b>from the second</b> large basket, <b>he covered</b> it <b>with a leather cover</b> as well. But after collecting funds from <b>the third</b> large basket, <b>he did not cover</b> it. The mishna asks: <b>Why did he cover</b> the first two baskets? In order to mark them as already having had funds collected from them. In this way, there was no concern that <b>perhaps he would forget and</b> once again <b>collect</b> funds <b>from</b> a basket from which funds <b>had</b> already <b>been collected.</b> The mishna specifies the intent of the one collecting the funds from the baskets as he does so: <b>He collected</b> funds <b>from the first</b> basket <b>on behalf of</b> the people living in <b>Eretz Yisrael;</b> from <b>the second</b> basket <b>on behalf of</b> the people living in <b>the cities near</b> Eretz Yisrael; and from <b>the third</b> basket <b>on behalf of</b> the people living in <b>Babylonia, and on behalf of</b> the people living in <b>Media, and on behalf of</b> <sup><b>[9b]</b></sup> the people living in <b>the distant countries.</b>",

The Gemara asks: <b>If there were two piles</b> of produce, and <b>one separated <i>teruma</i> from one</b> pile <b>on behalf of the other, hasn’t he exempted</b> with this <i>teruma</i> <b>the other</b> pile as well? When tithing produce, it is not necessary to separate <i>teruma</i> from each pile. It suffices to set aside an appropriate measure of <i>teruma</i> from one of them, and this counts as <i>teruma</i> for the other as well. Here too, the shekels are collected from the chamber not only on behalf of those who contributed those specific shekels, but even for those whose shekels were not collected. If so, why did the members of the house of Rabban Gamliel make such efforts to ensure that their shekels be the ones collected from the chamber? The Gemara answers: Even so, <b>they</b> got <b>satisfaction</b> from the fact <b>that the</b> communal <b>offering was necessarily brought from their</b> shekels <b>first.</b> For this reason, they exerted themselves to ensure that their shekels were collected from the chamber.",
                "The Gemara records several <i>halakhot</i> dealing with the collection of funds from the Temple treasury chamber. <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If the one collecting the funds from the chamber mistakenly <b>removed the leather covers</b> that he had placed on the large baskets, so that now he doesn’t know from which baskets shekels have already been collected and from which they have not yet been collected, <b>all</b> the shekels in the uncovered baskets <b>take on the status of the remainder</b> of the chamber. <b>It was taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>The third</b> collection of funds from the Temple treasury chamber that took place half a month before <i>Sukkot</i> <b>was the most abundant of all, as it contained</b> both <b><i>isteriot</i>,</b> small coins <b>of gold, and darics,</b> large coins <b>of gold.</b>",
                "<b>It was taught</b> in yet another <i>baraita</i>: <b>He collected</b> funds <b>from the first</b> basket <b>on behalf of</b> the people living in <b>Eretz Yisrael and on behalf of all of Israel;</b> from <b>the second</b> basket <b>on behalf of</b> the people living in <b>the cities [<i>kerakim</i>] near</b> Eretz Yisrael <b>and on behalf of all of Israel; and</b> from <b>the third</b> basket <b>on behalf of</b> the people living in <b>Babylonia and Media, and on behalf of</b> those who dwelled in <b>the distant countries, and on behalf of all of Israel.</b> The Gemara discusses the order in which the funds are taken from the baskets. <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: After shekels <b>were</b> first <b>taken from the first</b> basket labeled with an <i>alef</i>, <b>although</b> shekels still <b>remain in the first</b> basket, shekels <b>are taken from the second</b> basket labeled with a <i>beit</i>. After shekels <b>were taken from the second</b> basket, <b>although</b> shekels still <b>remain in the second basket,</b> shekels <b>are taken from the third</b> basket labeled with a <i>gimmel</i>.

He does not take from the shekels that remained in the chamber at the previous ceremony of collection into the baskets, as those coins acquired at that point the status of leftover shekels, which do not have sanctity. <b>Rabbi Meir says: He goes back to</b> take from <b>the leftover</b> shekels. <b>Because Rabbi Meir said: The <i>halakhot</i> of misusing</b> consecrated property <b>apply</b> even <b>to the leftover shekels,</b> as they remain in their sanctified state. Why so? <b>Perhaps they will be needed in the end,</b> since if the shekels collected from the chamber are depleted, the leftover can be used for the purchase of communal offerings.",
                "§ Since the previous mishna deals with the obligation to be guiltless even in the eyes of men and this mishna speaks of the alacrity displayed by the members of the house of Rabban Gamliel when they gave their shekels, the Gemara brings a <i>baraita</i> dealing with worthy traits, including the trait of alacrity: <b>And so Rabbi Pineḥas ben Yair would say: Alacrity</b> in the proper performance of the mitzvot <b>leads to cleanliness</b> of the soul, so that one will not sin. <b>Cleanliness</b> of the soul and refraining from all sin <b>leads to purity,</b> so that one purifies his soul from his previous sins. <b>Purity leads to holiness. Holiness leads to humility,</b> as one recognizes his lowliness. <b>Humility leads to fear of sin,</b> because when one recognizes his inferiority, he becomes more fearful of sin and is careful to avoid temptation. <b>Fear of sin leads to piety,</b> as one begins to impose upon himself stringencies beyond the letter of the law. <b>Piety leads to the holy spirit,</b> because when one acts in a manner that goes beyond the letter of the law, Heaven acts with him in a way that is not natural to man, and informs him of the secrets of the Torah through divine inspiration. <b>The holy spirit leads to the resurrection of the dead,</b> because the spirit of holiness and purity that descend upon him enter the bones of the deceased and resurrect them. <b>The resurrection of the dead</b> that will precede the arrival of the Messiah <b>leads to</b> the coming of the Prophet <b>Elijah, of blessed memory,</b> who will herald the upcoming redemption. The Gemara adduces proof texts for each of the previous statements: <b>Alacrity leads to cleanliness</b> of the soul, <b>as it is written: “And when he has made an end of atoning”</b> (Leviticus 16:20). “He has made an end” denotes alacrity; since one hastens to bring the process to conclusion, he achieves atonement, which cleanses the souls of sinners of their iniquities. <b>Cleanliness leads to purity, as it is written</b> with regard to the offering that a woman brings after her days of impurity and purity that follow childbirth (Leviticus 12): <b>“And the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be pure”</b> (Leviticus 12:8). Once she finishes the process of her atonement, that is to say, once she cleanses herself of sin, she reaches purity. <b>Purity leads to holiness, as it is written</b> with regard to the High Priest’s sprinkling of the blood of his bull and goat offerings on the golden altar on Yom Kippur: <b>“And he shall purify it, and hallow it”</b> (Leviticus 16:19), teaching that purity is followed by holiness. <b>Holiness leads to humility, as it is written: “For thus says the High and Lofty One that inhabits eternity, Whose name is Holy: I dwell on high and in a holy place, yet with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit”</b> (Isaiah 57:15). God’s holiness is drawn to a contrite and humble spirit. <b>Humility leads to fear of sin, as it is written: “The reward of humility is the fear of the Lord”</b> (Proverbs 22:4). <b>Fear of sin leads to piety, as it is written: “But the loving-kindness [<i>ḥesed</i>] of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon those who fear Him”</b> (Psalms 103:17). The recognition of God’s loving-kindness indicates piety [<i>ḥasidut</i>], which results from fear of God. <b>Piety leads to the holy spirit, as it is written: “Then You spoke in vision to Your pious ones”</b> (Psalms 89:20). <b>The holy spirit leads to the resurrection of the dead, as it is written: “And I shall put My spirit in you, and you shall live”</b> (Ezekiel 37:14). <b>The resurrection of the dead leads to</b> the coming of the Prophet <b>Elijah, of blessed memory, as it is written: “Behold, I will send you Elijah the Prophet before the coming of the great and terrible day of the Lord”</b> (Malachi 3:23). The day referred to here is the day of the resurrection of the dead. The Gemara concludes the chapter with a different discussion of virtues: <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in the name of Rabbi Meir: Anyone who</b> lives <b>permanently in Eretz Yisrael, and speaks the holy tongue, and eats the fruits of</b> Eretz Yisrael <b>in purity, and recites <i>Shema</i> in the morning and in the evening, will receive the tidings</b> and assurances <b>that he is one</b> who has merited <b>of the World-to-Come.</b> "

                "<strong>Halakha 1 · MISHNA</strong> At certain times of the year, half-shekels that had been donated to the Temple and stored in a chamber in the Temple were collected in order to be used for various purposes. The mishna asks: <b>The collection</b> of half-shekels, <b>what would they do with it? They</b> would <b>purchase</b> animals for the <b>daily offerings,</b> which were offered each morning and afternoon; <b>and</b> for <b>the additional offerings,</b> which were offered on Shabbat, the New Moon, and Festivals; <b>and</b> wine for <b>their libations;</b> barley for <b>the <i>omer</i></b> meal-offering; <b>and</b> wheat for both the <b>two loaves</b> offered on Shavuot <b>and the shewbread; and</b> animals for <b>all the communal offerings.</b> § The <b>guards of</b> the <b><i>sefiḥin</i>,</b> grain that grew without being purposely planted, <b>during the Sabbatical Year,</b> ensured that people did not take this ownerless grain, so that it remained available to be used for the <i>omer</i> and the offering of the two loaves.

Rabbi Yosei says: One who</b> so <b>desires</b> may <b>even volunteer</b> his services and guard the grain as <b>an unpaid bailee.</b> The Rabbis <b>said to him: Even you</b> must <b>say that</b> the <i>omer</i> and the two loaves <b>come only</b> <sup><b>[10a]</b></sup> <b>from communal</b> funds and not from any one individual. If one were to volunteer his services, he would acquire the grain for himself by guarding it and transporting it to the Temple. In that case, these offerings would have come from an individual. So that the offerings come solely from communal funds, the guards must receive payment from the half-shekels removed from the chamber.",
                "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna mentions a dispute about whether an individual may volunteer his services and guard the grain to be used for the <i>omer</i> and the two loaves. This dispute depends on whether something owned or donated by an individual may be brought as a communal offering. With regard to this issue, the Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> related to a mishna (<i>Ta’anit</i> 26a). The mishna lists days on which special offerings were brought, including wood donated on a regular basis by particular families for use on the altar. This time period was referred to as the time of the wood of the priests and of the nation. It was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Why was the time of the wood of the priests and of the nation fit to be counted</b> in the mishna when any individual may donate wood at any time? What makes these families and these times unique? The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>Rather, at the time that the Jewish people ascended from the</b> Babylonian <b>exile</b> and returned to Eretz Yisrael with Ezra, <b>they did not find wood in the</b> Temple <b>chamber</b> of wood for the altar, due to a lack of funds in the Temple treasury. <b>And these</b> families <b>took the initiative and donated wood from their own</b> property <b>and gave it to the community; and they offered communal offerings with it. And the prophets among them stipulated with them that,</b> in the future, <b>even</b> if <b>the chamber were full of wood,</b> if <b>these</b> families <b>took the initiative and donated wood from their own</b> property, the <b>offerings would be brought</b> using <b>only theirs first.</b> Consequently, the <i>baraita</i> indicates that communal offerings may come from individual funds. <b>Rabbi Aḥa said: This</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, as Rabbi Yosei says: One who</b> so <b>desires</b> may <b>even volunteer</b> his services and guard the grain as <b>an unpaid bailee.</b> However, according to the opinion of the Rabbis, which maintains that one may not donate his services, an individual may not donate the wood for the pyre on the altar. <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> an <i>amora</i>, said <b>in the name of Rabbi Ila: That</b> <i>baraita</i> is <b>a statement</b> accepted by <b>all.</b> If so, <b>with regard to what do</b> the Rabbis and Rabbi Yosei, the <i>tanna</i>, <b>disagree? With regard to the offering itself. However,</b> with regard to items that merely <b>facilitate an offering, everyone agrees that an individual offering</b> may be <b>changed to a communal offering,</b> i.e., that an individual may donate items that facilitate the sacrifice of a communal offering. The Gemara raises a similar issue. <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a woman who made a tunic,</b> one of the priestly vestments, <b>for her son</b> to wear while he serves in the Temple, the tunic <b>is valid.</b> However, since the priestly vestments must come from communal funds, the priest may use his mother’s tunic in the Temple only <b>provided that she</b> completely <b>transfers</b> ownership of the tunic <b>to the community.</b> <b>Rabbi Aḥa said:</b> This <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, as Rabbi Yosei says: One who</b> so <b>desires</b> may <b>donate even</b> his services and guard the grain as <b>an unpaid watchman. Rabbi Yosei,</b> an <i>amora</i>, said <b>in the name of Rabbi Ila: That</b> <i>baraita</i> is <b>a statement</b> accepted by <b>all.</b> If so, <b>with regard to what do</b> the Rabbis and Rabbi Yosei <b>disagree? With regard to the offering itself. However,</b> with regard to items that merely <b>facilitate an offering, everyone agrees that an individual offering</b> may be <b>changed to a communal offering.</b> <b>A <i>baraita</i> disagrees with</b> Rabbi Aḥa’s explanation of the dispute between <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> and the Rabbis: <b>Those days</b> of family celebrations, on the occasion of donating wood for the altar, <b>are observed</b> both <b>during the time</b> when one can bring an <b>offering,</b> i.e., when the Temple stands, <b>and during the time</b> when <b>no offering</b> can be brought, i.e., when there is no Temple; nevertheless the family still holds a celebration on those dates. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: They are observed only during the time of offering.</b> This <i>baraita</i> demonstrates that even the Rabbis, who disagree with Rabbi Yosei, admit that individuals can donate wood for the pyre, which is why they celebrated this event during the time of the Temple. The Gemara cites <b>an additional</b> source with regard to <b>this</b> topic, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok, said: We were among the descendants of Senaah, son of</b> the tribe of <b>Benjamin,</b> a family that donated wood to the Temple on the tenth of Av. <b>And</b> one year, <b>the Ninth of Av occurred on Shabbat, and we postponed</b> the fast <b>until the conclusion of Shabbat,</b> in accordance with the <i>halakha</i>. <b>And we fasted but did not complete</b> the fast, due to our family celebration. Apparently, the family continued to commemorate the offering of wood even after the destruction of the Temple, as there was no fast of the Ninth of Av while the Temple stood. Had the original donation of wood been only for individual offerings, the celebration of that donation would not have continued after the destruction of the Temple. Therefore, this <i>baraita</i> indicates that Rabbi Ila’s understanding is correct, and even the Rabbis agree that with regard to items that facilitate an offering, an individual offering may be changed into a communal offering.",
                "§ The mishna teaches that the collection of the Temple treasury was used to purchase the necessary items for <b>the <i>omer</i>, and the two loaves, and the shewbread, and all communal offerings,</b> as well as for the salary of those guarding the <i>sefiḥin</i>. <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Menaḥot</i> 83b): <b>All</b> the grain for <b>individual and communal offerings</b> may <b>come</b> both <b>from Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and from outside</b> of <b>Eretz</b> Yisrael. It may come both <b>from new</b> grain that grew after the offering of the <i>omer</i> the previous year <b>and from old</b> grain, <b>except for the <i>omer</i></b> itself <b>and the two loaves, which</b> may <b>come only from new</b> grain <b>and from Eretz</b> Yisrael. <b>Rav Ḥuna</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Yirmeya:</b> The mishna is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yishmael, as Rabbi Yishmael says: The <i>omer</i> may not come from Syria</b> or any other location outside of Eretz Yisrael. The Gemara cites a similar discussion. <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Kelim</i> 1:6): <b>There are ten</b> levels <b>of sanctity. Eretz Yisrael is more sanctified than all</b> other <b>lands. And</b> through <b>what</b> <i>halakha</i> is <b>its sanctity</b> expressed? It is evident in the <i>halakha</i> <b>that they</b> must <b>bring from it the <i>omer</i>, the first fruits, and the two loaves, which may not be brought from</b> the produce of <b>any other lands. Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Yirmeya: This</b> mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yishmael, as Rabbi Yishmael said: The <i>omer</i> may not come from Syria</b> or any other location outside of Eretz Yisrael. Similarly, <b>we learned</b> elsewhere in a mishna (<i>Shevi’it</i> 1:4) that <b>Rabbi Yishmael says</b> that the verse “In plowing time and in harvest you shall rest” (Exodus 34:21) is not referring to the prohibition against farming the land during the Sabbatical Year, as the Rabbis explain. Rather, it is referring to the prohibition against performing labor on Shabbat. The reason that the verse mentions these two particular forms of labor is to teach that <b>just as</b> the <b>plowing</b> that is prohibited on Shabbat is an otherwise <b>voluntary</b> act, as plowing is never required by the Torah, <b>so too,</b> the <b>harvesting</b> that is prohibited on Shabbat <b>is voluntary. The harvesting of the <i>omer</i> is excluded</b> from the prohibition, <b>as it is a mitzva.</b> The barley for the <i>omer</i> must be harvested on the sixteenth of Nisan, even if it occurs on Shabbat. <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> is consistent with <b>his</b> own <b>opinion</b> in this matter, <b>as</b> it is <b>Rabbi Yishmael who said: The <i>omer</i> may not come from Syria</b> or any other location outside of Eretz Yisrael. This is <b>consistent with his opinion</b> stated elsewhere, <b>as he said: The harvesting of the <i>omer</i> is excluded</b> from the prohibition on Shabbat, <b>as it is a mitzva.</b> Since Rabbi Yishmael requires that the <i>omer</i> come from Eretz Yisrael, it must be permitted to harvest it during the Sabbatical Year, despite the fact that harvesting is generally prohibited during the Sabbatical Year. This is consistent with Rabbi Yishmael’s opinion that the <i>omer</i> is excluded from the category of prohibited labor on Shabbat because harvesting it is a mitzva; the same holds true for the Sabbatical Year as well. The Gemara asks with regard to the mishna: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught: The guards of <i>sefiḥin</i> during the Sabbatical Year collect their wages from the collection of the</b> Temple treasury <b>chamber? It is Rabbi Yishmael.</b> It is apparent from the mishna that the <i>omer</i> must come from Eretz Yisrael; otherwise, there would be no need to hire guards to ensure that there be barley available to use, as it could be imported from outside Eretz Yisrael. <b>Rabbi Yosei said:</b> The mishna is <b>a statement</b> accepted <b>by all,</b> even by those who hold that the <i>omer</i> may be brought from outside of Eretz Yisrael. According to this opinion, if <b>they could not find</b> barley <b>in Syria</b> or anywhere else outside of Eretz Yisrael, <b>they would bring</b> the <i>omer</i> <b>from <i>sefiḥin</i> that were in Eretz Yisrael.</b> Therefore, the guards were still necessary. Since it is permitted to harvest the <i>omer</i> even during the Sabbatical Year, the Gemara asks: With regard to <b>that <i>omer</i>,</b> if it becomes clear that there are no <i>sefiḥin</i> in a particular Sabbatical Year, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>planting</b> it <b><i>ab initio</i>?</b> When <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Adda</b> heard this question, <b>he asked, in the presence of Rabbi Mana:</b> In general, a handful of a meal-offering is burned on the altar, and the remainder of the meal-offering may be eaten by the priests. If the remainder may not be eaten by the priests, the entire offering is invalid. In the case under discussion, if one were to plant barley during the Sabbatical Year, <b>would it not be</b> comparable to the case of <b>a handful</b> of a meal-offering whose <b>remainder may not be eaten,</b> as it is prohibited to eat produce that is planted during the Sabbatical Year? Rabbi Mana <b>said to him:</b> The <i>omer</i> is nonetheless valid, as <b>it becomes like the five</b> offerings <b>that</b> may be <b>brought in</b> a state of <b>ritual impurity but may not be eaten in</b> a state of <b>impurity.</b> There is a mishna in tractate <i>Pesaḥim</i> (76b) that lists five communal offerings that are offered in a state of impurity under certain circumstances; however, they may not be eaten in a state of impurity. Similarly, the <i>omer</i> that is brought from barley that was planted during the Sabbatical Year is valid, despite the fact that after the handful is burned on the altar, the remainder of the meal mixture may not be eaten.",
                "§ The Gemara asks: <b>How does</b> the treasurer <b>do</b> this, i.e., pay the salaries to the guards and harvesters from the chamber collection? The money in the Temple treasury is consecrated property, and consecrated property may be desacralized only through redemption (<i>Arakhin</i> 33a). The Gemara answers: <b>He takes money from the money changer and gives</b> that money as payment <b>to the harvesters and to the guards before the <i>omer</i> is offered.</b> Once the time for offering the <i>omer</i> arrives, <b>he brings money from the collection of the</b> Temple treasury <b>chamber and desacralizes</b> it by transferring its sanctity <b>onto</b> the barley that is to be used for the <i>omer</i>. This money now becomes unconsecrated and is used to repay the money changer. The Gemara asks: <b>Is this acceptable?</b> The monetary value of the <i>omer</i>, which is used to desacralize the funds, is far less than the amount paid to the harvesters and guards. The Gemara answers. <b>Rabbi Aḥa</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Ba: Whatever</b> the treasurer <b>gives</b> them as payment <b>is</b> considered to be <b>its monetary value from the beginning</b> of the process, even if the barley is worth considerably less on the open market. On a similar note, <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is <b>even so with</b> regard to <b>stoneworkers,</b> who hew stones from mountains and cut them for use in the Temple. They too receive their salary from the Temple treasury. <b>How does</b> the treasurer <b>do</b> this? <b>He takes money</b> as a loan <b>from a money changer and gives</b> it as payment <b>to the ledgemen and to the stonecutters before</b> the stone <b>is placed on the row [<i>dimos</i>]</b> that is being built. <b>Once it is placed on the row, he brings money from the collection of the chamber and desacralizes it onto</b> the stones. In this way, the stones become consecrated and the money becomes unconsecrated. That money is then used to repay the money changer. The Gemara asks: <b>Is this acceptable?</b> The workers are paid for all their labor, yet some of the stones become broken and unfit for use. Therefore, the amount of money spent by the treasury is more than the actual value of the stones placed on the structure of the Temple. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Bun,</b> said <b>in the name of Shmuel: Whatever</b> the treasurer <b>gives</b> them as payment <b>is</b> considered to be <b>the monetary value</b> of the stones <b>from the beginning.</b> The value of the stones that are used includes the value of the stones that broke during the process."

The same is true for <b>the ramp</b> built from the Temple Mount to the location on the Mount of Olives, where they would slaughter the red <b>heifer; the ramp</b> built to lead the <b>scapegoat</b> out of the city; <b>the strip</b> of crimson wool <b>that was</b> tied <b>between its horns;</b> any repairs required for <b>the aqueduct</b> that ran through the Temple courtyard and <b>the walls of the city and its towers; and</b> for <b>all the needs of the city,</b> such as street repairs, security, and the like. All of these <b>come from the remains of the chamber,</b> i.e., from the money that remained in the chamber after the three collections of money were taken to use for communal offerings. <b>Abba Shaul says: The High Priests construct the ramp</b> for <b>the</b> red <b>heifer from their own</b> funds. <b>What would they do with the leftover remains of the chamber</b> after all the items mentioned above had been attended to? <b>They</b> would <b>purchase wine, oil, and fine flour</b> and sell them to those who needed them for their private offerings. <b>And the profit</b> from these sales would go <b>to consecrated</b> property, i.e., to the Temple treasury; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva says: One may not generate profit by</b> selling <b>consecrated</b> property, <b>neither</b> may one profit <b>from</b> funds set aside <b>for the poor.</b> <b>What would they do with the leftover</b> funds <b>of the collection</b> that had not been spent on communal offerings? They would purchase <b>golden plates</b> as a <b>coating for the</b> walls and floor of the <b>Holy of Holies. Rabbi Yishmael says: The leftover produce</b> was used to purchase the <b>repletion of the altar,</b> i.e., burnt-offerings sacrificed at times when the altar was idle. <b>The leftover</b> funds <b>of the collection</b> were used <b>to</b> purchase <b>sacred vessels.</b> <b>Rabbi Akiva says: The leftover</b> funds <b>of the collection</b> were used to purchase the animals used <b>for the repletion of the altar,</b> since they had originally been collected for offerings. <b>The leftover libations</b> were used <b>to</b> purchase <b>sacred vessels. Rabbi Ḥananya, the deputy [<i>segan</i>] High Priest, says: The leftover libations</b> were used to purchase animals for <b>the repletion of the altar,</b> while <b>the leftover</b> funds <b>of the collection</b> were used <b>to</b> purchase <b>sacred vessels.</b> Both <b>this</b> Sage, Rabbi Akiva, and <b>that</b> Sage, Rabbi Ḥananya, <b>did not agree</b> with Rabbi Yishmael’s opinion <b>with regard to the</b> leftover produce.",
                "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> Since the mishna mentions both the <b>ramp</b> used to transport the red <b>heifer</b> and the strip of crimson wool, the Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Naḥman,</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Yonatan: There are three strips</b> of crimson, each of which is a different weight. That <b>of the scapegoat is</b> the weight <b>of a <i>sela</i>,</b> as it had to be divided into two, one to tie between the scapegoat’s horns and one to tie on a rock. It is sufficient for the strip of crimson wool used in the purification <b>of a leper</b> to weigh <b>a shekel,</b> half of a <i>sela</i>, as it is not divided in half. The strip of crimson wool that was used in the process <b>of</b> burning the red <b>heifer is of two <i>sela</i>.</b> In order to sink into the mass of burning material, it had to be the heaviest of strips. <b>Rabbi Ḥunya</b> from the city <b>of Berat Ḥavrin</b> said that <b>Rabbi Ba, son of Zavda,</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta:</b> The crimson strip <b>of the</b> red <b>heifer is of two and a half <i>sela</i>. Some expressed</b> his statement using the <b>language: Of ten <i>zuz</i>.</b> This is the equivalent of two and a half <i>sela</i>; however, it is important to quote one’s teacher using the identical language that his teacher used.",
                "§ The Gemara cites additional opinions with regard to the items that are purchased with the remains of the chamber. <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Shmuel: The Torah scholars who teach the priests the <i>halakhot</i> of slaughtering, the <i>halakhot</i> of collecting</b> the blood of an offering in a sacred vessel, and <b>the <i>halakhot</i> of sprinkling</b> the blood on the altar <b>collect their wages from the collection of the chamber. Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Redifa</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Imi: Inspectors of blemishes of consecrated</b> animals <b>collect their wages from the collection of the chamber. Rabbi Aḥa</b> said that <b>Rabbi Tanḥum bar Ḥiyya</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Simlai: The proofreaders of the</b> Torah <b>scroll</b> that was kept in <b>the</b> Temple <b>courtyard collect their wages from the collection of the chamber.</b> <b>Giddel, son of Binyamin,</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Asi: The two</b> chief <b>judges</b> in Jerusalem, who establish fines and adjudicate cases of <b>thefts, collect their wages from the collection of the chamber. Shmuel says: The women who weave the curtain</b> that separates the Temple Sanctuary from the Holy of Holies <b>collect their wages from the collection of the chamber. Rav Ḥuna said:</b> They collect their wages <b>from the collection for Temple maintenance.</b> With regard to <b>what do they argue? Shmuel considers it like an offering,</b> as the blood of certain offerings is sprinkled on the curtain. <b>Rav Ḥuna considers it like</b> part of <b>the building,</b> and funds for the building itself come from the collection for Temple maintenance. <b>Rabbi Ḥizkiya said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda Gudgadot taught: The</b> funds for the <b>incense and all communal offerings come from the collection of the</b> Temple treasury <b>chamber. The</b> funds for the <b>golden altar,</b> located inside the Sanctuary and on which the incense was offered, <b>and all sacred vessels come from</b> the <b>leftover money</b> of that set aside for the <b>libations. The</b> funds for <b>the altar of burnt-offering,</b> which was located outside the Sanctuary and on which most offerings were burned; <b>and</b> for <b>the Sanctuary</b> itself; <b>and the</b> various <b>courtyards come from the remains of the chamber.</b> Funds for whatever was <b>outside the courtyards come from</b> the money stored in <b>the chamber for Temple maintenance.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that one who derives benefit from <b>the stones of the altar, the Sanctuary, or the courtyards</b> thereby <b>misuses</b> consecrated property? Therefore, if one does so unwittingly, he is liable to repay to the Temple treasury the value of the loss he caused or benefit he gained, in addition to a fine of one-fifth of that amount, and he must bring a guilt-offering. <b>And is there misuse</b> of consecrated property <b>with regard to</b> items purchased with the <b>remains</b> of the chamber? The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, as Rabbi Meir says: One misuses</b> consecrated property even if he derives benefit from items purchased <b>with the remains</b> of the chamber. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya said</b> in response to this suggestion: <b>Did Rabbi Meir say</b> this statement <b>other than within its year?</b> Even Rabbi Meir agrees that one violates the prohibition against misusing consecrated property by deriving benefit from the remains of the chamber only within the year for which those coins were donated. Since the funds could still be used for communal offerings if needed during that year, the prohibition applies. <b>But here, we are dealing with</b> funds that are <b>outside the year</b> of their collection, as the remains of the chamber were not used to purchase stones until after the year was over. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> is not in accordance with Rabbi Meir, and the challenge to Rabbi Yehuda Gudgadot remains.",
                "Having cited Rabbi Yehuda Gudgadot, referred to now as Rabbi Yehuda Gudganiyot, the Gemara cites another of his rulings. <b>Rabbi Ḥizkiya said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda Gudganiyot taught:</b> If <b>the table and the candelabrum and the altars and the curtain</b> are incomplete or are not in their proper location, <b>they prevent offerings</b> from being brought; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. The Rabbis say: The only</b> items <b>that prevent the offering</b> from being brought <b>are the</b> water <b>basin and the base alone,</b> as the Temple rite may not be performed if the basin and its base are not in place. However, <b>didn’t Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yosei ben Ḥanina both say: Wherever it is written: Opposite,</b> in describing the proper location for one of the sacred vessels, its absence <b>prevents</b> offerings from being brought. For example, with regard to the candelabrum, the verse states: “And the candelabrum opposite the table” (Exodus 26:35). Wherever the verse states: <b>Side,</b> the absence of the vessel <b>does not prevent</b> offerings from being brought. For example, with regard to the table, the verse states: “And you shall place the table on the south side” (Exodus 26:35). <b>And Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said in the name of Rabbi Yonatan: Even</b> absence of a vessel whose location is described with the <b>side, prevents</b> offerings from being brought. <b>And Rabbi Ila said in the name of</b> <sup><b>[11a]</b></sup> <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: And even</b> correct <b>placement, is necessary</b> for offerings to be valid. According to this view, if the candelabrum, either of the two altars, the table, the curtain, or the basin is invalid or not in its proper location, sacrificial offerings are not accepted. All of the <i>amora’im</i> cited here apparently disagree with the opinion of the Rabbis cited in the <i>baraita</i>, who maintain that the only vessels that invalidate offerings are the basin and its base. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> There is no disagreement between these <i>amora’im</i> and the Rabbis. <b>Here,</b> the statements of the <i>amora’im</i> are <b>with regard to the rites that are</b> performed <b>inside</b> the Temple, such as bringing the incense, lighting the candelabrum, placing the shewbread on the table, and sprinkling blood on the curtain. The vessels located inside the Temple are essential for the validity of these rites. However, <b>here,</b> the statement of the Rabbis is <b>with regard to the rites that are</b> performed <b>outside</b> of the Sanctuary, i.e., in the courtyard, such as the sacrificing of most offerings. Only the absence of the basin or its base invalidates these rites.",
                "§ We learned in the mishna that, according to Abba Shaul, the High Priests would pay for the ramp of the red heifer from their own funds. With regard to this issue, <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: There was great haughtiness among the High Priests, as they would spend more than sixty talents of gold on it.</b> This expenditure was unnecessary, <b>as the</b> previous <b>ramp of the heifer was</b> still <b>standing. But not one of</b> the High Priests <b>would take out his heifer on his fellow’s ramp. Rather, he would demolish it and build</b> a new one <b>from his own</b> funds. <b>Rabbi Ulla raised an objection in the presence of Rabbi Mana: Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Shimon HaTzaddik performed</b> the rites of <b>two</b> red <b>heifers,</b> and <b>the ramp on which he took out this</b> one <b>he did not</b> use again to <b>take out that</b> other one? <b>Is it possible for you to say Shimon HaTzaddik was haughty? What, then,</b> is the reason that he constructed a new ramp? It is <b>due to a higher</b> standard that was established <b>with regard to the</b> ceremony of the red <b>heifer; it is</b> due to a higher level of <b>honor [<i>silsul</i>] accorded to</b> the ceremony of <b>the red heifer.</b> <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Projections and walls would extend</b> from the ramp <b>from here and from there,</b> i.e., on either side, <b>in order that the priests would not peek</b> out over the edge of the ramp <b>and become ritually impure</b> by leaning their bodies over a grave without any interposition.",
                "§ We learned in the mishna that according to Rabbi Yishmael, the leftover remains of the chamber were used to purchase wine, oil, and fine flour. These items were sold to individuals who needed them for their private offerings, and the proceeds went to the Temple treasury. Whereas <b>Rabbi Akiva says: One may not generate profit</b> by selling consecrated property or by using funds set aside for the poor. The Gemara explains that Rabbi Akiva prohibited doing business with consecrated funds only when there was a risk of loss. <b>However, if</b> the seller of the wine, oil, or fine flour <b>wanted</b> to agree that any <b>loss</b> from the subsequent sale of these items would be <b>his, while</b> any <b>profit</b> gained would go <b>to</b> the Temple treasury of <b>consecrated</b> property, it is <b>permitted.</b> The potential profit or loss would result from fluctuations in the market price of these items. An example <b>like this</b> can be found in an incident involving <b>bar Zemina. Funds</b> belonging to <b>orphans were deposited with him. He came and asked Rabbi Mana</b> if he was permitted to invest these funds. Rabbi Mana <b>said to him: If you want</b> to agree <b>that</b> any <b>loss</b> will be <b>yours and</b> any <b>profit</b> will belong to <b>both of you</b> to share, then <b>it is permitted. Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Adda</b> had <b>funds</b> belonging to <b>orphans deposited with him and he did so;</b> he accepted all losses and split the profits with the orphans.",
                "§ It was taught in the mishna that according to Rabbi Yishmael, the <b>leftover produce</b> was used to purchase the repletion of the altar, i.e., burnt-offerings sacrificed at times when the altar was idle. This leftover produce discussed in <b>the mishna is</b> referring to the profits earned, in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yishmael</b> cited earlier, <b>as Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef explained the mishna</b> as follows: The <b>leftover produce</b> mentioned by Rabbi Yishmael is a reference to his earlier statement that <b>the profits</b> from the sales of wine, oil, and flour went <b>to</b> the Temple treasury of <b>consecrated</b> property. Regarding the term <b>leftover libations</b> mentioned by Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Ḥananya, the deputy High Priest, <b>this</b> is referring to the <b>fourth <i>se’a</i>.</b> If the treasurer of the Temple paid in advance for a year’s worth of wine, oil, and flour, and the price of these goods later rose, the seller was required to provide the goods at the original, lower price. The treasury then sold these items at the higher price to individuals who needed them for offerings. For example, if the treasurer paid for flour at the price of four <i>se’a</i> for one <i>sela</i>, and the price then rose to three <i>se’a</i> for one <i>sela</i>, the seller would have to provide four <i>se’a</i> for one <i>sela</i>. This fourth <i>se’a</i> was sold, and the profit from this sale was given to the Temple. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan explained the mishna</b> as follows: <b>The leftover produce, this</b> is referring to <b>the fourth <i>se’a</i>. The leftover libations,</b> this is referring <b>to the overfill [<i>beirutzin</i>]</b> of the substance when measured. When one sells a certain measure of wine, oil, or flour to the Temple treasury, he is required to fill the measuring vessel above the rim, so that he provides more than the exact measurement. However, when the Temple treasurer sells these products, he must be exact in the measurements. The difference between these two amounts is referred to in the mishna as the leftover libations. The Gemara asks: <b>And is Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef not</b> of the opinion that the Temple profits from <b>the overfill?</b> Why, then, does he omit any reference to it in his explanation of the mishna? <b>Rabbi Ḥizkiya said: That which befalls the fourth <i>se’a</i> befalls the overfill</b> as well. Both fall under the same category of leftover libations. It works out well <b>according to the opinion of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef,</b> which maintains that the leftover produce was sold for profit by the Temple treasury: <b>One may not generate profit</b> by selling <b>consecrated</b> property, <b>and not even with</b> funds set aside <b>for the poor,</b> and <b>therefore</b> the mishna concludes: Both <b>this</b> Sage <b>and that</b> Sage, Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Ḥananya, <b>did not agree</b> with Rabbi Yishmael’s opinion <b>with regard to the</b> leftover produce. However, <b>in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> which maintains that the leftover produce is referring to the profit gained from the fourth <i>se’a</i>, <b>it is difficult. Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna that if the treasurer paid for a product at the price of four units per <i>sela</i>, and at the time it was delivered the price had risen and <b>stood at three</b> units per <i>sela</i>, the seller must still <b>provide</b> the produce at the original price <b>of four</b> units per <i>sela</i>, leaving the Temple treasury with an extra unit from which to profit? Apparently, all agree that the treasury may profit in this manner. However, <b>we learned</b> in the mishna that <b>this</b> Sage <b>and that</b> Sage, Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Ḥananya, <b>did not agree</b> with Rabbi Yishmael’s opinion <b>with regard to</b> the leftover <b>produce.</b> The Gemara answers: Everyone agrees that the fourth <i>se’a</i> may be sold on behalf of the Temple treasury. When the mishna says that Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Ḥananya did not agree with regard to the leftover produce, it means that they <b>did not agree</b> that the profits <b>from the produce</b> should be used <b>for</b> purchasing <b>the repletion of the altar. However, they did agree</b> that they may be used <b>for</b> purchasing <b>sacred vessels.</b> It appears that all agree that profits from the overfill of the measures are used to purchase sacred vessels. The Gemara asks: <b>Until here,</b> it is reasonable to say that the <b>overfill</b> from <b>communal</b> offerings is used to purchase sacred vessels. However, is it possible to say that the sacred vessels could be purchased <b>even with</b> the <b>overfill of individual</b> offerings? <b>Wouldn’t it turn out that the sacred vessels had come from an individual,</b> which is not permitted? The Gemara answers that it is <b>like that which we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a woman who made a tunic,</b> one of the priestly vestments, <b>for her son</b> to wear while he serves in the Temple, the tunic <b>is valid.</b> However, since the priestly vestments must come from communal funds, the priest may only use his mother’s tunic in the Temple <b>provided that she</b> completely <b>transfers</b> ownership of the tunic <b>to the community.</b> Similarly, if the owner donates the overfill to the public, it is permissible to use the profit to purchase sacred vessels. <b>Until now,</b> the discussion has concerned <b>liquid overfill,</b> e.g., wine or oil. Since the overfill was originally within the confines of the sacred vessel, it attained consecrated status. Is the same true <b>even for dry overfill,</b> such as fine flour, in which the overfill was piled on top of the already full vessel? If the overfill was never actually within the confines of the vessel, is it consecrated? The Gemara answers: The <i>halakha</i> <b>is in accordance with that which we learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Menaḥot</i> 79a): In the case of <b>the libations,</b> which include fine flour, <b>that were sanctified in a</b> sacred <b>vessel and,</b> subsequently, <b>the offering</b> they were meant to accompany <b>is found to be disqualified, if there is another offering there</b> that requires libations, <b>they</b> may be <b>sacrificed with it. And if not,</b> and <b>they are left overnight, they become disqualified by</b> being <b>left overnight.</b> Since the mishna in <i>Menaḥot</i> does not distinguish between liquid libations and fine flour, the Gemara understands that no distinction should be drawn with regard to the overfill; even dry overfill is consecrated and can be used for the purchase of sacred vessels."

                " <strong>Halakha 3 · MISHNA</strong> <b>The leftover incense</b> from one year could not be used the following year, as it had been purchased with the shekels collected for the previous year. <b>What would be done with it</b> in order to make it usable? The Temple treasurers <b>would set aside</b> an amount <b>of it</b> equal to the value of <b>the wages of the artisans</b> who worked in the Temple. <b>They would</b> then <b>desacralize</b> that incense by transferring its sanctity <b>to the money</b> owed to <b>the artisans. They would</b> then <b>give</b> the incense <b>to the artisans as their wages.</b> Finally, <b>they would return and buy</b> back the incense from the artisans with funds <b>from the new collection</b> of shekels. <b>If the new</b> funds <b>come on time,</b> i.e., by the beginning of Nisan, <b>they purchase</b> the incense with funds <b>from the new collection</b> of shekels. <b>And if not,</b> they may still purchase it <b>from the old</b> collection, and it is valid.",
                "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> We learned in the mishna that the leftover incense was desacralized with money that the Temple treasury owed the artisans. The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t it found</b> that this process involves <b>consecrated property being desacralized with consecrated property?</b> The artisans were paid with money from the Temple treasury, which was also consecrated, yet consecrated property can be desacralized only by transferring its sanctity to unconsecrated property. The Gemara answers that the incense was desacralized with this money after the money itself had been desacralized. <b>How does</b> the treasurer of the Temple appointed to this task <b>do</b> so? <b>Rabbi Shimon bar Bisna said: He brings money</b> from the treasury <b>and desacralizes it onto the building</b> that the artisans have constructed, which is not yet sanctified. <sup><b>[11b]</b></sup> <b>He</b> then <b>brings the incense and desacralizes</b> it by transferring its sanctity <b>onto</b> the money. The Temple treasurers then <b>give</b> the incense <b>to the artisans as their wages.</b> Finally, they buy back the incense with the funds from the new collection, as taught in the mishna. <b>That money</b> that was used to desacralize the incense, which is now consecrated, <b>what should be done with it? Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: I say</b> that <b>it should be given to the house of Garmu and to the house of Avtinas, who were experts in the preparation of the incense and in the production of the shewbread.</b> The producers of the incense and the shewbread receive their payment from the collection of the Temple treasury chamber. <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak said: And this is</b> true only <b>when</b> the treasury <b>owes them money from</b> work done <b>previously,</b> but it should not be given to them as advance payment for work they will do in the future, as the wages for work they do from the month of Nisan and on should come from the collection of the new year. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ba asked:</b> If the Temple treasury <b>did not owe</b> these artisans <b>money from</b> work done <b>previously,</b> what would be done with the money? <b>Rabbi Ba came</b> and said <b>in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> who said <b>in the name of Rabbi Yosei:</b> The treasury uses the money to buy offerings <b>with which they replete the altar.</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ba accepted this answer. <b>Rabbi Ba bar Kohen asked in the presence of Rabbi Yosei: Is the opinion of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ba reversed? There,</b> at first, <b>he needed</b> clarification with regard to this question, <b>and here it is obvious to him</b> that one may use the money to pay for the repletion of the altar. The answer to the question was given by Rabbi Ba in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya, and that same Rabbi Ḥiyya asked the question. The Gemara explains: <b>That</b> about <b>which he needed</b> clarification <b>is</b> whether the money used to desacralize the incense may be used to purchase <b>sacred vessels. That which was obvious to him is</b> that the money may be used to buy offerings for the <b>repletion of the altar.</b>",
                "Rabbi Ḥiyya’s initial dilemma with regard to purchasing sacred vessels with the money used to desacralize incense reflects his indecision concerning the dispute about <b>which</b> two <i>amora’im</i> <b>disagreed:</b> If one <b>prepared</b> incense <b>in a non-sacred</b> vessel, <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: It is disqualified</b> for use in the Temple, as incense must be consecrated by being placed in a sacred vessel. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: It is valid</b> for use, as there is no requirement that incense be placed in a sacred vessel during its preparation. According to the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, all incense is sacred on the level of a sacred vessel. Consequently, the money exchanged for it will have the same level of sanctity, and it can be used to purchase sacred vessels. However, according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, it is possible to have prepared incense that has not yet been placed in a sacred vessel. The money exchanged for such incense may not be used to purchase sanctified vessels, as it does not have the appropriate level of sanctity. <b>What is the source</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina?</b> The verse states about incense: <b>“It is holy”</b> (see Exodus 30:37). This teaches <b>that its creation,</b> i.e., its preparation, must take place in <b>a sacred</b> vessel, so that it has elevated sanctified status from its inception. <b>What is the source</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi? “It is holy,”</b> meaning <b>that it must come from the collection of the</b> Temple treasury <b>chamber,</b> i.e., from the public and not from an individual. However, once it is purchased from communal funds, it may be prepared even in a non-sacred vessel. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Bun, said:</b> The opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei ben Ḥanina goes in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel. And</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b> <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 12a): There is a tannaitic disagreement concerning <b>one who consecrates</b> all of <b>his possessions, and among them there are items</b> that are <b>suitable for</b> use as <b>communal offerings. Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> identified the possession the mishna is referring to and <b>said: Incense.</b> Apparently, he maintained that it is possible for one to be in possession of incense that has not yet been consecrated. Therefore, he must also maintain that incense that was prepared in a non-sacred vessel is valid for use, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi. <b>Rabbi Hoshaya</b> said: The mishna <b>should be explained</b> as referring specifically <b>to an artisan of the house of Avtinas, who would receive incense as his wages.</b> The incense was prepared in a sacred vessel, but it could come into his possession after being desacralized. <b>And</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei ben Ḥanina is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel, as Rav Huna said in the name of Shmuel:</b> With regard to the <b>mortar,</b> within which they crushed the ingredients of the incense, the Sages <b>considered it like a sacred vessel</b> with regard <b>to</b> its ability to bestow an elevated, <b>consecrated</b> status upon its contents. Apparently, Shmuel holds that the incense must be prepared in a sacred vessel. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Bun, said: Rabbi Ḥuna said</b> this <i>halakha</i> of Shmuel <b>in the presence of Rabbi Yosei</b> and asked: May <b>an item that was sanctified in a sacred vessel be redeemed?</b> Since placing an item in a sacred vessel elevates its sanctity, ordinarily it would not be possible to transfer its sanctity onto money. Yet Shmuel insists that the incense be prepared in a sacred vessel, and the leftover incense was desacralized by transferring its sanctity onto money. Rabbi Yosei <b>said to him: Isn’t that</b> precisely the opinion <b>of Shmuel? As Shmuel said: This is a leniency with regard to leftover</b> communal offerings, including incense. They can, in fact, be desacralized, despite their elevated level of sanctity. The Gemara cites the source of Shmuel’s opinion: The <i>amora’im</i> <b>disagreed</b> with regard to <b>unblemished</b> lambs that had been set aside for the daily offerings and <b>remained</b> unused at the end of the year. They may not be sacrificed in the coming year, as they were not purchased with funds collected for that year. <b>Shmuel said:</b> Although in general one may redeem such animals only after they develop a blemish, in this case <b>they</b> may be <b>redeemed</b> even <b>as unblemished</b> animals. The Temple treasury could then purchase them anew from the newly collected funds, rendering them suitable as offerings for the new year. The same holds true for remaining incense; it too may be desacralized in a more lenient manner. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> Although they are animals remaining from the previous year, they still must be <b>redeemed</b> in the regular manner, <b>like</b> any other <b>consecrated animals that have been disqualified.</b> One must wait until they develop a blemish; only at that point may they be redeemed. The Gemara raises a similar issue: If <b>goats</b> that were set aside for communal sin-offerings <b>were left over</b> at the end of the year, according to <b>Shmuel</b> they may be redeemed in their unblemished state. <b>If a burnt-offering</b> may be <b>redeemed</b> unblemished, <b>all the more so</b> it should be permitted to redeem an animal set aside as <b>a sin-offering.</b> With regard to an animal set aside for a burnt-offering, if it was not redeemed in its unblemished state, but became blemished and was subsequently redeemed, the funds used for its redemption would go to purchase another burnt-offering for the repletion of the altar. The value set aside as burnt-offering thus would remain dedicated to that purpose. In the parallel case of a sin-offering, the funds used to redeem a blemished leftover communal sin-offering did not go to the purchase of a new sin-offering but to the purchase of a burnt-offering for the repletion of the altar as well. Since the animal’s sanctification as a sin-offering is effectively nullified in any case, it is easier in such a case to be lenient and permit the redemption of the animal even before it has become blemished. <b>Rabbi Ze’eira said in accordance with Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion:</b> Even in the case of leftover communal sin-offerings, the animals must <b>graze</b> until they develop a blemish; only then may they be redeemed. The funds used to redeem the animals became sanctified and were allocated for the purchase of burnt-offerings for the repletion of the altar. <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak said: They,</b> i.e., the leftover sin-offerings, are <b>themselves</b> used as burnt offerings to <b>replete the altar</b> without being redeemed. The Gemara asks: <b>But this is difficult: Is there a sin-offering that</b> may be <b>brought</b> as <b>a burnt-offering? Rabbi Yosei said: This</b> case <b>is different,</b> as it is dealing with a communal offering; <b>communal offerings are designated</b> as a particular type of offering <b>only with</b> their <b>slaughter,</b> and not when they are consecrated in the first place. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> offers a different explanation and says: <b>It is a condition of the court,</b> which stipulates <b>with regard to remaining</b> animals <b>that</b> even if they have been set aside as communal sin-offerings <b>they</b> may be <b>sacrificed as burnt offerings.</b>"

                "<sup><b>[12a]</b></sup> <strong>Halakha 4 · MISHNA</strong> <b>One who consecrates</b> all <b>his possessions</b> without specifying for what purpose, his possessions are consecrated for Temple maintenance. <b>And</b> if <b>among them there are items</b> that are <b>suitable for</b> use as <b>communal offerings,</b> which may not be used for the maintenance of the Temple but only for sacrificial purposes, what is done with those items to remove their consecration for Temple maintenance, in order that they may be reconsecrated for sacrificial use? <b>They are given to</b> Temple <b>artisans as their wages,</b> and thereby they are desacralized; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. Ben Azzai said to him: This is not the method</b> to be used. <b>Rather,</b> the same method that is used to desacralize the leftover incense, as is described in the previous mishna, should also be used here, i.e., <b>they set aside from</b> the consecrated items the equivalent of the value owed to the <b>artisans for their wages, and they desacralize them</b> by transferring their sanctity <b>onto</b> the <b>money</b> allocated <b>for the artisans’</b> wages, <b>and</b> then <b>they give those</b> items, which are no longer consecrated, <b>to the artisans as their wages.</b> According to both opinions, once the desacralized items are in the possession of the artisans, one of Temple treasurers <b>should repurchase those</b> items using money <b>from</b> that year’s <b>new collection of half-shekels,</b> consecrating them for sacrificial use during the coming year. In the case of <b>one who consecrates</b> all <b>his possessions</b> without specifying for what purpose, <b>and among them there is an animal that is suitable</b> to be sacrificed <b>on the altar, male</b> or <b>female,</b> what should be done with it? <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> Since he did not specify otherwise, everything is consecrated for Temple maintenance. Therefore, any <b>males</b> should <b>be sold for the needs of burnt-offerings,</b> i.e., to individuals who will sacrifice them as such. <b>And</b> any <b>females,</b> since they cannot be brought as burnt-offerings, should <b>be sold for the needs of peace-offerings,</b> i.e., to individuals who will sacrifice them as such. <b>And their monetary value</b> that is received from their sale is <b>allocated with the rest of his property for Temple maintenance.</b> <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> Although he did not specify for what purpose he consecrated his possessions, it may be assumed that he intended the animals to be consecrated as burnt-offerings. Therefore, any <b>males</b> should <b>themselves be sacrificed as burnt-offerings, and</b> any <b>females,</b> since they cannot be brought as burnt-offerings, should <b>be sold for the needs of peace-offerings,</b> i.e., to individuals who will sacrifice them as such, <b>and their monetary value</b> that is received from their sale should be used to purchase and <b>bring burnt-offerings.</b> According to both opinions, <b>the rest of the possessions,</b> which are not suitable for sacrificial use, <b>are allocated for Temple maintenance.</b> <b>Rabbi Akiva said: I see the statement of Rabbi Eliezer</b> as more correct <b>than the statement of Rabbi Yehoshua, since Rabbi Eliezer applied his method equally</b> to both animals and other possessions in treating both as consecrated for Temple maintenance, whereas <b>Rabbi Yehoshua made a distinction</b> between them. <b>Rabbi Papeyyas said: I heard the statements of both of them</b> applied to different situations: <b>One who consecrates</b> all his possessions and <b>explicitly</b> states that his animals are to be included, clearly intends to equate his animals with the rest of his possessions, that both should be consecrated for the same purpose, i.e., for Temple maintenance. Therefore, he should act <b>in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Eliezer.</b> However, with regard to <b>one who consecrates</b> all his possessions <b>without</b> explicitly <b>specifying</b> that this includes his animals, since there is no reason to presume that he wishes them all to be consecrated for the same purpose, it is presumed that each item is consecrated for the purpose most suited to it. Therefore, he should act <b>in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Yehoshua.</b> In the case of <b>one who consecrates</b> all <b>his possessions, and among them there were items that are suitable to</b> be sacrificed <b>on the altar,</b> such as <b>wines</b> for libations, <b>and oils</b> for meal-offerings, <b>and birds,</b> e.g., turtledoves or young pigeons, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: They are sold for the needs of that kind</b> of item, i.e., to individuals who will use them as such. <b>And he should bring with their monetary value</b> that is received from their sale <b>burnt-offerings. And the rest of the possessions are allocated for Temple maintenance.</b>",
                "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that there is a dispute with regard to the case of <b>one who consecrates</b> all his possessions, and among them there were items that are suitable for use as <b>communal offerings. Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The mishna is referring to one whose possessions include ingredients used to prepare the <b>incense. Rabbi Hoshaya says:</b> If so, the mishna <b>should be explained</b> as referring specifically <b>to an artisan of the house of Avtinas, who would receive incense as his wages.</b> There is a dispute about whether the incense may be prepared by an individual in a non-sacred vessel and then dedicated to the Temple. Explaining the mishna as referring to an artisan who received the incense from the Temple means that the mishna holds true for both sides of the dispute. § The mishna teaches that Rabbi Akiva holds that incense consecrated for Temple maintenance may be desacralized simply by giving it to the artisans as their wages, but ben Azzai insisted the incense must be desacralized by transferring its sanctity to money. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of ben Azzai?</b> He holds <b>that consecrated</b> property <b>cannot be desacralized upon labor</b> since it is intangible. <b>Rather,</b> it can be desacralized only <b>upon</b> a tangible object, such as <b>money.</b>",
                "The Gemara notes: <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Temura</i> 31b): <b>There are</b> certain <i>halakhot</i> that apply to <b>items consecrated for Temple maintenance</b> that do not apply to animals consecrated for the altar. They are: <b>That unspecified consecrated</b> items are consecrated <b>for Temple maintenance.</b><br><b>Consecration for Temple maintenance takes effect on all</b> types of objects, even wood, stones, and blemished animals; while consecration for the altar takes effect only on objects that may be brought as offerings upon the altar.<br><b>One</b> violates the prohibition against <b>misuse</b> of consecrated objects by deriving benefit <b>from that which grows from</b> items consecrated for Temple maintenance, such as an egg of a chicken or milk of a domesticated animal. One who derives benefit is liable to pay a fifth of the principle amount in addition to sacrificing the relevant guilt-offering.<br><b>And</b> unlike with animals consecrated to the altar, <b>there is no benefit from them for the priests.</b> Priests sometimes benefit from animals consecrated to the altar by eating portions of the offerings or receiving their hides. <b>Rabbi Ḥananya said</b> that this mishna is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer, as we learned in the mishna:</b> In the case of <b>one who consecrates</b> all <b>his possessions</b> without specifying for what purpose, <b>and there was among them an animal that is suitable</b> to be sacrificed <b>on the altar,</b> whether <b>males</b> or <b>females, Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> Any <b>males</b> should <b>be sold for the needs of burnt-offerings,</b> i.e., to individuals who will sacrifice them as such; <b>and</b> any <b>females,</b> since they cannot be brought as burnt-offerings, should <b>be sold for the needs of peace-offerings,</b> i.e., to individuals who will sacrifice them as such. <b>And their monetary value</b> that is received from their sale is <b>allocated with the rest of his property for Temple maintenance.</b> Unlike Rabbi Yehoshua, who argues with him in the mishna, Rabbi Eliezer assumes that since he did not specify otherwise, all one’s possessions, including his animals, are consecrated for Temple maintenance and must therefore be desacralized. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The source for Rabbi Eliezer’s</b> opinion is the verse: <b>“And when a man shall consecrate his house to be holy to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 27:14). <b>To what</b> case <b>are we referring</b> in the verse? <b>If</b> you suggest this verse is referring to <b>a dwelling place,</b> that cannot be correct because <b>it is already written: “And if the one who consecrated it will redeem his house”</b> (Leviticus 27:15). <b>Rather, we are referring to one who,</b> without specifying for what purpose, <b>consecrates</b> all <b>his possessions. From here</b> it is derived <b>that unspecified consecrated</b> property is allocated <b>for Temple maintenance.</b>",
                "The Gemara cites differing opinions concerning which cases Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua agree and disagree upon: <b>Rabbi Ze’eira said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥuna</b> said <b>in the name of Rav: With regard to what</b> case <b>do they disagree?</b> They disagree with regard to <b>one who consecrates</b> all <b>his possessions</b> without specifying for what purpose. <b>However, with regard to one who consecrates</b> the animals in <b>his flock</b> without specifying for what purpose, <b>everyone agrees that they are</b> consecrated <b>for the altar.</b> Since the consecration includes only items that are suitable to be sacrificed on the altar, even Rabbi Eliezer concedes that it is assumed that one consecrated them for the altar and not for Temple maintenance. <b>Rabbi Ba</b> said that <b>Rav Ḥuna</b> said <b>in the name of Rav: With regard to what</b> case <b>do they disagree? With regard to one who consecrates</b> the animals in <b>his flock</b> without specifying for what purpose. <b>However, with regard to one who consecrates</b> all <b>his possessions</b> without specifying for what purpose, including animals that are unsuitable to be sacrificed on the altar, <b>everyone agrees that they are</b> consecrated <b>for Temple maintenance.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>According to the opinion of Rabbi Ze’eira, it works out well.</b> It is understandable that all agree that when one consecrates only animals, his intention is that they be used as offerings on the altar, for why else would he consecrate them? <b>However, there is a difficulty with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ba,</b> who maintains that even in such a case Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua disagree. <b>Isn’t an animal</b> suitable <b>for</b> the <b>altar?</b> Why then would Rabbi Eliezer disagree and say that the animals are consecrated for Temple maintenance? The Gemara answers: Indeed, <b>an animal is</b> suitable <b>for</b> the <b>altar. Why</b> then <b>did this man</b> decide to consecrate his animals <b>without specifying</b> that this was his intent? Apparently, his intention was not for them to be used on the altar; rather, <b>he is like one who says</b> that these animals should <b>be</b> consecrated <b>only for Temple maintenance.</b> There is a third opinion concerning the dispute: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: There is no difference</b> between the two cases. <b>Both this</b> case of <b>one who consecrates</b> all <b>his possessions</b> and <b>that</b> case of <b>one who consecrates</b> the animals in <b>his flock</b> are alike. In both cases, <b>the disagreement</b> applies.",
                "It was taught in the mishna that Rabbi Eliezer holds that animals that were consecrated for Temple maintenance are sold to those who need to bring them as offerings. What is the status of such animals after being sold? <b>Rav Ḥuna</b> said <b>in the name of Rav</b> that <b>Rabbi Abbahu</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> Animals that were <b>consecrated for Temple maintenance that were redeemed</b> by being sold, while still <b>unblemished</b> and therefore still suitable to be used as an offering, are nevertheless <b>transferred to non-sacred</b> status. The buyer must then consecrate the animals anew for use as offerings. The Gemara brings a proof. <b>The mishna</b> (<i>Ḥullin</i> 130a) <b>said that</b> as well: If animals are consecrated after already having developed a blemish, only their inherent value is sanctified. Therefore, <b>their offspring and their milk are permitted</b> to be used for mundane purposes <b>after their redemption,</b> since their sanctity is entirely removed upon their redemption. So too, the sanctity of animals that are consecrated for Temple maintenance is entirely removed upon their being redeemed, even if they are unblemished, as their sanctity inheres only in their value. <sup><b>[12b]</b></sup> The Gemara disarms this proof. <b>Rav Ḥizkiya</b> said <b>in the name of Rav Ḥisda:</b> The comparison to the mishna <b>should be explained</b> as referring to a case where the animals that were consecrated for Temple maintenance <b>were redeemed</b> while still <b>unblemished,</b> but they then <b>developed a blemish.</b> Once an animal has developed a blemish, its sanctity ceases to be inherent and inheres only in its monetary value. As long as the animal remains unblemished, it retains some inherent sanctity that is not removed upon redemption. <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> said <b>in the name of Rav Ḥisda: The mishna</b> (<i>Temura</i> 31b) <b>said that</b> as well: If animals consecrated for the altar subsequently develop a blemish, <b>it is prohibited</b> to use <b>their offspring or their milk</b> for any mundane purpose, even <b>after their redemption.</b> The mishna continues: However, if an animal consecrated for Temple maintenance subsequently develops a blemish, and is redeemed, it is permitted to use its offspring or milk for mundane purposes. The sanctity is fully removed only if the animal has a blemish. This implies that even animals that are consecrated for Temple maintenance retain some sanctity after redemption so long as they are unblemished. The Gemara cites support for the opposing view of Rabbi Yoḥanan that even if the animal did not develop a blemish, it loses all its sanctity upon its redemption: <b>Rabbi Ḥizkiya</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Yosei:</b> Animals <b>consecrated for Temple maintenance that were redeemed</b> while still <b>unblemished are</b> entirely <b>transferred to non-sacred</b> status; they retain no sanctity at all. This must be correct, for <b>if you say they are not</b> entirely <b>transferred to non-sacred</b> status but retain some of the sanctity of their original consecration for Temple maintenance, <b>how can</b> the sanctity of <b>items consecrated to the altar take effect upon items consecrated for Temple maintenance?</b> In the mishna, it is clear that when an unblemished animal consecrated for Temple maintenance is redeemed by being sold, the buyers may consecrate the animals to the altar. But if the animals still retain the sanctity of Temple maintenance, this would not be possible, due to the principle that one may not change the status of an item from one type of consecrated status to another (see <i>Temura</i> 32b). Perforce, all their sanctity is removed upon redemption, despite the fact that they are still unblemished.",
                "The Gemara accepts the preceding argument as compelling. Perforce, Rav Ḥisda should accept it. Why, then, does he claim that it is prohibited to use for any mundane purpose animals that are redeemed before developing a blemish? The Gemara explains: Rav Ḥisda holds that only animals that are <b>blemished</b> will become entirely non-sacred upon redemption. He holds that, by rabbinic decree, <b>the sanctity of the altar takes effect upon them.</b> With regard <b>to what matters</b> does it take effect? With regard <b>to</b> the prohibition against <b>shearing</b> them <b>and</b> using them for <b>labor.</b> However, he agrees that according to Torah law, they have no sanctity of the altar, since they were not consecrated for that purpose. Therefore, their sanctity is removed entirely upon redemption. § It was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who set aside a female</b> animal and consecrates it <b>for his burnt-offering,</b> or <b>his Paschal lamb,</b> or <b>his guilt-offering,</b> although these offerings may be brought only from a male animal, the consecration is still effective in endowing the female animal with inherent sanctity, such that <b>it makes a substitute;</b> if he tries to substitute another animal in place of the first, both animals are consecrated. <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> If one consecrated a female animal for <b>his burnt-offering, it makes a substitute;</b> however, if he consecrated it for <b>his Paschal lamb</b> or <b>his guilt-offering, it does not make a substitute. Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda said in the name of Rabbi Shimon:</b> In all cases, whether one consecrated it for <b>his burnt-offering,</b> or for <b>his Paschal lamb,</b> or for <b>his guilt-offering, it does not make a substitute.</b> The Gemara explains the basis for the different opinions in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon,</b> as cited by the first <i>tanna</i>, is <b>that we find</b> a case in which <b>a female bird is valid to be brought as a burnt-offering.</b> It is therefore clear that sanctity of a burnt-offering can be applied to a female animal, and consequently, a substitute can be made from it. However, this is not true with regard to a Paschal lamb or a guilt-offering, which are never brought from a female animal. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda</b> in the name of Rabbi Shimon is based on the following <i>a fortiori</i> argument: <b>If</b> two animals are <b>of the same kind,</b> i.e., the same gender, and <b>one is distinct from</b> the other in a small, invalidating detail, that distinction is sufficient to prevent the animal from attaining any sanctity. This is <b>all the more so</b> in the case of two animals of <b>different kinds,</b> i.e., of different genders, which is a distinction of greater import. If being of one gender invalidates the animal, it will certainly prevent the invalid animal from attaining any sanctity. <b>What is the</b> case of two animals <b>of the same kind,</b> where <b>one is distinct from</b> the other in a small, invalidating detail? <b>Like that which was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to one who is obligated to sacrifice <b>a guilt-offering</b> from an animal less than <b>one year old and brings</b> an animal that was <b>two years old,</b> or one who is obligated to sacrifice <b>a guilt-offering</b> from an animal that was <b>two years old and brings</b> an animal that was <b>three years old, he does not fulfill his obligation.</b> In the first case, the animal is endowed with sanctity. However, in the second case, the animal remains non-sacred, despite the fact that the two animals are of the same kind and are distinct only in regard to one detail, their age. § <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Rabbi Shimon,</b> as cited by Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda, <b>and Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> in the mishna, <b>both said the same idea. Just as Rabbi Yehoshua said</b> that <b>a female</b> animal that was consecrated without a specific purpose <b>is not consecrated</b> with inherent sanctity <b>as a burnt-offering,</b> but <b>rather it is consecrated</b> only <b>with sanctity</b> that inheres in the animal’s <b>monetary value, so too, Rabbi Shimon said</b> that <b>a female</b> animal that was consecrated to be brought as a burnt-offering <b>is not consecrated</b> with inherent sanctity <b>as a burnt-offering,</b> but <b>rather it is consecrated</b> only <b>with sanctity</b> that inheres in the animal’s <b>monetary value,</b> which is why one cannot make a substitute from it. It is clear that Rabbi Yehoshua holds that the animal does not have inherent sanctity. <b>If you say</b> he holds that one <b>consecrated</b> the female animal <b>with inherent sanctity,</b> then it would not be permitted to sell it for the needs of peace-offerings, as Rabbi Yehoshua indeed rules in the mishna. Rather, <b>it</b> should have to <b>graze</b> until it develops a blemish, since animals with inherent sanctity may not be sold until they develop a blemish. The Gemara cites the remainder of the <i>baraita</i> already cited above: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: I</b> do not <b>see the statement of Rabbi Shimon</b> as correct <b>with regard to</b> a female animal consecrated for <b>a Paschal lamb.</b> Rabbi Shimon said that the animal does not attain any sanctity, since a Paschal lamb is brought only from male animals. I disagree, <b>because a leftover Paschal lamb,</b> a Paschal lamb that was not slaughtered on Passover, <b>is brought as a peace-offering,</b> which can be brought from female animals. It is therefore appropriate for the consecration for a Paschal lamb to take effect upon a female animal and endow it with inherent sanctity, in a manner similar to Rabbi Shimon’s own argument concerning a burnt-offering. <b>But,</b> according to this line of logic, <b>let</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi also <b>say: I do not see the statement of Rabbi Shimon with regard to</b> a female animal consecrated for <b>a guilt-offering</b> as correct. Rabbi Shimon said that the animal does not attain any sanctity, since a guilt-offering is brought only from male animals. However, based on Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s reasoning in the case of a Paschal lamb, he should also disagree here, <b>since a leftover guilt-offering,</b> a guilt-offering that was not sacrificed as such because its owner achieved atonement with a different guilt-offering, <b>is brought as a burnt-offering,</b> and as Rabbi Shimon himself explained that the consecration of a female animal for a burnt-offering takes effect. <b>Rabbi Avin said:</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s argument for a Paschal lamb does not extend to a guilt-offering, because there is a crucial distinction between the cases: <b>If one consecrates</b> an animal as <b>a Paschal lamb,</b> and it is not used as such, and it is therefore <b>brought as a peace-offering,</b> the animal <b>itself is sacrificed as a peace-offering.</b> However, <b>if one consecrates</b> an animal as <b>a guilt-offering,</b> and it is not used as such, and it is therefore <b>brought as a burnt-offering,</b> the animal <b>itself is not sacrificed as a burnt-offering.</b> Rather, it is left until it develops a blemish, then it is sold, and the proceeds are used for the purchase of a burnt offering. <b>What is</b> behind <b>this</b> disagreement between Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and Rabbi Shimon concerning a female animal consecrated as a Paschal lamb? <b>This one,</b> Rabbi Shimon, <b>says:</b> Surely <b>he consecrated</b> the animal only <b>with sanctity</b> that inheres in the animal’s <b>monetary value,</b> since he knows that it cannot actually be brought as a Paschal lamb. <b>And this one,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>says:</b> We do not make that assumption. Rather, <b>he consecrated</b> the animal to have <b>inherent sanctity,</b> and it takes effect because a leftover Paschal lamb can be brought as a peace-offering.",
                "§ Rabbi Yehoshua taught in the mishna that if one consecrates animals without specifying for what purpose, the animals are endowed with the sanctity of burnt-offerings. <b>Rabbi Ze’eira</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: The source for Rabbi Yehoshua’s</b> opinion is: <b>“Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel, and say unto them: Any man of the house of Israel,</b> or of the strangers in Israel, <b>that brings</b> his offering, whether it be any of their vows, or any of their free-will offerings, which are brought <b>to the Lord as a burnt-offering”</b> (Leviticus 22:18). The verse is taken to mean that <b>all</b> vows or free-will offerings that can be brought to the Lord, i.e., animals, are consecrated to be <b>sacrificed as burnt-offerings</b> unless otherwise specified. The next verse states: <b>“That you may be accepted, you shall sacrifice a male without blemish”</b> (Leviticus 22:19). This verse would seem to limit to male animals the principle learned in the preceding verse. <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>even females</b> that are consecrated without a specific purpose are also endowed with the sanctity of a burnt-offering? <b>The</b> continuation of the <b>verse states: “Of the cattle”</b> (Leviticus 22:19), which is a general term that comes <b>to include females.</b> <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak, son of Rabbi Elazar, asked:</b> Although <b>it is</b> explicitly <b>written “male.” You said</b> that the phrase <b>“of the cattle”</b> comes <b>to include females.</b> If this is true, then <b>in a similar manner,</b> one could make the following claim: Although <b>it is</b> explicitly <b>written “without blemish,” you</b> could <b>say</b> that the phrase <b>“of the cattle”</b> comes <b>to include blemished</b> animals.",
                "For <b>what is</b> the difference <b>between them?</b> Why should one assume that the phrase “of the cattle” includes only female animals but not blemished animals? <b>Rav said:</b> The difference between them is so clear it is as if <b>the weaver’s rod [<i>shivta dekhadkada</i>] is between them:</b> Female animals are suitable to be brought on the altar in some form, whereas blemished animals are never suitable to be brought on the altar.",
                "§ The mishna teaches: In the case of one who consecrates all his possessions without specifying for what purpose, and among them are wines, oils, and birds, which are suitable to be sacrificed on the altar, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: They are sold</b> for the needs of that <b>kind</b> of item, i.e., to individuals who will use them as such, and the proceeds are used to purchase burnt-offerings. Rabbi Eliezer holds that items suitable for use on the altar that are consecrated without specifying their purpose are consecrated with sanctity that inheres in the item’s value, yet they are designated as burnt-offerings. Therefore, everything, including the birds, must be sold to achieve that end. <b>Rabbi Abbahu</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: The source of Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion</b> is: <b>“Speak to Aaron, and to his sons,</b> and to all the children of Israel, and say unto them: Any man of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that brings his offering, whether it be any of their vows, or any of their free-will offerings, <b>which are brought to the Lord as a burnt-offering”</b> (Leviticus 22:18). The verse is taken to mean that <b>all</b> vows or free-will offerings that can be brought to the Lord, i.e., animals, are consecrated to be <b>sacrificed as burnt-offerings,</b> unless otherwise specified. The next verse states: <b>“That you may be accepted, you shall sacrifice a male without blemish”</b> (Leviticus 22:19). <b>I might</b> have thought this verse teaches that an unspecified consecration can be fulfilled with the sacrifice of any unblemished male, <b>even birds.</b> To reject this possibility, <b>the</b> continuation of the <b>verse states: “Of the cattle”</b> (Leviticus 22:19), which includes only domesticated animals <b>and not birds.</b> <b>Rabbi Yirmeya and Rabbi Bun bar Ḥiyya were sitting and saying: There,</b> in explanation of the <i>baraita</i> cited above concerning one who consecrated a female animal for a burnt-offering, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said that the reason for Rabbi Shimon’s opinion,</b> as cited by the first <i>tanna</i>, that the female is consecrated with the inherent sanctity of a burnt-offering is <b>that</b> there is that there is a case of <b>a female bird that is valid to be brought as a burnt-offering.</b> Yet <b>here,</b> in this case concerning the consecration of a female bird itself, Rabbi Eliezer <b>said this.</b> Presumably, Rabbi Eliezer agrees with Rabbi Yoḥanan’s explanation of Rabbi Shimon’s opinion. If the argument for a female animal gaining inherent sanctity when consecrated for a burnt-offering is based on a case of a female bird, how can it be that when a bird itself is consecrated it does not attain inherent sanctity and can therefore be sold? <sup><b>[13a]</b></sup> The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Yosei said: I established</b> Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion as being <b>in accordance with that which Rabbi Shmuel said in the name of Rabbi Ze’eira: Anything that cannot be sacrificed</b> on the altar, <b>neither itself nor its monetary value,</b> as it cannot be redeemed, <b>is consecrated only with sanctity</b> that inheres in its <b>monetary value. And</b> therefore, <b>you,</b> Rabbi Eliezer, <b>said correctly: You are not able to sacrifice</b> this bird on the altar, <b>as it is written: “Of the cattle,” and not birds. You are not able to redeem</b> the bird were it to have inherent sanctity, <b>as there is no</b> concept of <b>redemption for birds. Therefore, you must say that it is consecrated only with sanctity</b> that inheres in its <b>value.</b>",
                "§ In the <i>baraita</i> cited above, Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda said in the name of Rabbi Shimon that if one consecrates a female animal for a burnt-offering, a Paschal lamb, or a guilt-offering, it is endowed only with sanctity that inheres in the animal’s value, since a female animal is invalid for these offerings. Consequently, a substitute cannot be made from it. <b>The group</b> of students said <b>in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan, and Rabbi Ayyevu bar Nagri said in the presence of Rabbi Ila, in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: The source</b> for the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>,</b> Rabbi Shimon, is the verse in the passage about substitution: <b>“And if it be any unclean animal, of which they may not bring an offering to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 27:11), which indicates that an unclean animal that was consecrated cannot make a substitution. <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “unclean,”</b> as it certainly is not referring to an animal of an unclean species of animal, i.e., a non-kosher animal, since they are already disqualified by a different verse? <b>Rather,</b> it is referring <b>even</b> to an animal of a clean, kosher species that is only <b>unclean,</b> i.e., unsuitable, <b>for that</b> particular <b>category</b> of offering. The Gemara notes: <b>It is difficult</b> to justify this source as the basis for Rabbi Shimon’s opinion because, <b>with regard to this, it is written</b> in the continuation of the verse: <b>“Then he shall stand</b> the animal before the priest. <b>And</b> the priest <b>shall value</b> it” (Leviticus 27:11–12), indicating that before being redeemed, the animal must be stood before the priest for valuation. However, Rabbi Shimon himself holds that this process is necessary only for animals that have inherent sanctity. Perforce, this verse and the previous one are referring to cases where the animal has inherent sanctity. If so, these verses cannot be used as the basis for Rabbi Shimon’s opinion in the <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Ze’eira, in the name of Rabbi Elazar, did not say</b> that <b>this</b> verse is the basis of Rabbi Shimon’s opinion. <b>Rather,</b> he explained it as the basis for the opposing opinion: <b>“And if it be any unclean animal, of which they may not bring an offering to the Lord.”</b> The superfluous word “offering” indicates that <b>any</b> animal <b>that is not suitable to be sacrificed, neither here,</b> for the type of offering for which it was consecrated, <b>nor anywhere else,</b> as any other type of offering, is never endowed with inherent sanctity. Therefore, <b>a substitute cannot be made</b> from it. This principle <b>excludes</b> the case of <b>a female</b> animal that was consecrated <b>for a burnt-offering. Although it is not suitable to be sacrificed here,</b> as an animal burnt-offering, <b>it is suitable to be sacrificed in another place,</b> such as a bird burnt-offering. This verse therefore serves as a source for the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i> in that <i>baraita</i>, who holds that a female animal consecrated for a burnt-offering, a guilt-offering, or a Paschal lamb is endowed with inherent sanctity, and therefore a substitute can be made from it. The Gemara challenges this principle: <b>Rabbi Avun and Rabbi Bun asked in the presence of Rabbi Ze’eira:</b> But <b>there is</b> the case of an animal <b>that sodomizes</b> a person <b>or</b> an animal <b>that is sodomized, which are not suitable to be sacrificed, neither here,</b> for the kind of offering for which it was consecrated, <b>nor anywhere else</b> as any other kind of offering, <b>and</b> yet <b>a substitute can be made</b> from it. The Gemara answers: <b>He said to them: Even I said</b> this principle <b>only</b> with regard to an animal that is <b>actually unclean,</b> i.e., from a non-kosher species. But it does not apply to an animal of a kosher species that is disqualified for some other reason. The Gemara notes: <b>But it is difficult</b> to claim that “unclean” is referring to an animal of an unclean, non-kosher species, because <b>with regard to this, it is written</b> in the subsequent verses: <b>“Then he shall stand</b> the animal before the priest. <b>And</b> the priest <b>shall value</b> it” (Leviticus 27:11–12), indicating the procedure for redeeming the animal. This certainly cannot refer to an animal of a non-kosher species, since a verse later on (Leviticus 27:27) addresses that case. Rabbi Ze’eira’s derivation is therefore problematic."

                "<strong>Halakha 1 · MISHNA</strong> <b>These are the officials who served</b> in specific positions <b>in the Temple: Yoḥanan ben Pineḥas</b> was responsible <b>for the seals.</b> One who paid for a specific type of sacrificial item received a seal, which he presented to the Temple official in exchange for that item. <b>Aḥiyya</b> was responsible <b>for the libations,</b> i.e., the wine, oil, and flour prepared with the level of ritual purity necessary for the libation offerings and the meal-offerings, which accompanied many animal offerings. Aḥiyya supplied the libations to those who presented the appropriate seal. <b>Matya ben Shmuel</b> was responsible <b>for the lotteries,</b> which were used to select priests for the various Temple services each day. <b>Petaḥya</b> was responsible <b>for the pairs</b> of birds, i.e., the turtledoves or pigeons, brought by a <i>zav</i>, a <i>zava</i>, a woman after childbirth, and a leper. They placed the appropriate sum of money into the horn designated for this purpose, and each day Petaḥya oversaw the purchase of birds from that money and their sacrifice in the proper manner. Incidentally, the Gemara mentions: <b>Petaḥya is Mordecai</b> from the book of Esther. <b>And why was he called Petaḥya,</b> which resembles the word for opening [<i>petaḥ</i>]? The reason is <b>that he would open,</b> i.e., elucidate, difficult <b>topics and interpret them</b> to the people, <b>and</b> because <b>he knew</b> all <b>seventy languages</b> known at the time. The mishna resumes the list of officials. <b>Ben Aḥiyya</b> was responsible <b>for</b> the care of the priests who suffered from <b>intestinal disease. Neḥunya</b> was the <b>well digger</b> for pilgrims on their way to Jerusalem for the Festivals. <b>Gevini</b> was the Temple <b>crier</b> who would awaken the priests and the Levites for their Temple duties. <b>Ben Gever</b> was responsible <b>for locking the</b> Temple <b>gates</b> in the evening and for unlocking them in the morning. <b>Ben Bevai</b> was <b>appointed over the shreds</b> of garments, which were formed into wicks for the Temple candelabra. He also supervised the twisting of those wicks into the appropriate thickness for the various nights during the different seasons of the year. <b>Ben Arza</b> was responsible <b>for the cymbal,</b> which was rung as a signal that the Levites should commence their song. <b>Hugras ben Levi</b> was responsible <b>for the song.</b> He taught and conducted the singers in the Temple. <b>The house of Garmu</b> was responsible <b>for the preparation of the shewbread; the house of Avtinas</b> was responsible <b>for the preparation of the incense; and Elazar</b> was responsible <b>for</b> weaving <b>the</b> Temple <b>curtains; and Pineḥas</b> was <b>the valet,</b> who assisted the priests in fitting their clothes and dressing themselves for their Temple service.",
                "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna lists fifteen names of officials who filled specific positions in the Temple, despite the fact that during the many years of the Temple there must have been far more than fifteen officials who served those functions. <b>Rabbi Ḥizkiyah said</b> that <b>Rabbi Simon and the Rabbis</b> disagreed as to why the mishna mentions only these fifteen names. <b>One</b> of them <b>said:</b> The mishna <b>comes to enumerate those</b> who were the most <b>fit</b> of all the officials who served in each position, <b>from whatever generation</b> they were from. <b>And the other said:</b> The <i>tanna</i> <b>who was in that generation enumerated those</b> functionaries <b>who</b> served <b>in his generation.</b> Several of these officials are also mentioned in the mishna in Yoma, some for praise (37a), and others for censure (38a). The Gemara notes that this issue is related to the aforementioned dispute. <b>The one who said</b> that the mishna <b>comes to enumerate the</b> most <b>fit</b> of those who served <b>from whatever generation</b> claims that when the mishna in <i>Yoma</i> <b>says: “The memory of a righteous person shall be for a blessing”</b> (Proverbs 10:7) it is <b>in reference to all of them.</b> According to this opinion, the <i>tanna</i> in <i>Yoma</i> maintains that the reason these officials did not teach their specialties to others was because they wanted to prevent their knowledge from being used for idol worship. The only officials censured are those like ben Kamtzar, who refused to divulge their secrets for unworthy reasons, but these people are not mentioned in the mishna. Conversely, <b>the one who said</b> that the <i>tanna</i> <b>who was in that generation enumerated those</b> officials <b>who</b> served <b>in his generation,</b> he claims that the mishna in <i>Yoma</i> <b>says: “But the name of the wicked shall rot”</b> (Proverbs 10:7) <b>in reference to all of them. And with regard to whom is</b> the <i>tanna</i> in <i>Yoma</i> <b>speaking</b> when he cites the verse: <b>“The memory of a righteous person shall be for a blessing”?</b> He is referring only <b>to ben Katin,</b> who improved the basin for the priests in the Temple, <b>and his colleagues.</b>",
                "<sup><b>[13b]</b></sup> § After recording the praises of certain historical figures, the Gemara continues in a similar vein. <b>Rabbi Yona said</b> that <b>it is written: “Therefore will I divide him a portion among the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the mighty;</b> because he bared his soul until death, and was numbered with the transgressors” (Isaiah 53:12). <b>This</b> verse <b>is</b> referring to <b>Rabbi Akiva, who</b> conveyed the Oral Law to the people by <b>arranging the halakhic and homiletic midrash.</b> <b>And some say</b> that <b>the members of the Great Assembly arranged these</b> compilations of Torah knowledge. <b>But</b> if so, <b>what did this</b> Sage, Rabbi Akiva, <b>arrange?</b> He arranged the interpretive method of <b>generalizations and details.</b>",
                "<b>Rabbi Abbahu said:</b> The lineage of Salma, son of Caleb, son of Hur, is listed in the book of Chronicles. <b>It is written</b> there: <b>“And the families of scribes that dwelt at Jabez:</b> The Tirathites, the Shimeathites, the Sucathites; these are the Kenites that came of Hammath, the father of the house of Rechab” (I Chronicles 2:55). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> the word <b>scribes,</b> literally, counters? It does not mean that they were scribes; <b>rather,</b> it means <b>that they crafted</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>the Torah</b> into <b>numbered groups.</b> They categorized and brought together disparate <i>halakhot</i> into a mnemonic device to assist learners. The Gemara lists some examples of this numerical categorization: <b>Five</b> categories of people may <b>not separate <i>teruma</i>; five types</b> of grain <b>require</b> the separation <b>of <i>ḥalla</i></b> from their dough; <b>fifteen</b> categories of <b>women exempt their co-wives</b> from levirate marriage and <i>ḥalitza</i> if they were both married to the same man who died childless; <b>thirty-six</b> transgressions for which one is liable to receive <b><i>karet</i></b> are listed <b>in the Torah; thirteen matters are stated with regard to the unslaughtered carcass of a kosher bird;</b> there are <b>four primary categories of damages;</b> and the number of <b>primary categories of labor</b> prohibited on Shabbat <b>is forty-less-one.</b>",
                " The Gemara cites a different interpretation for the Hebrew word for scribe. <b>Rabbi Eliezer said: It is written:</b> “Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave <b>to Ezra the priest the scribe,</b> a scribe of the words of the mitzvot of the Lord, and of His statutes to Israel” (Ezra 7:11). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> the word <b>scribe [<i>sofer</i>]</b> twice? “Scribe” can be interpreted as scholar. The verse is not redundant; <b>rather,</b> it means that <b>just as</b> Ezra <b>was a scholar in matters of Torah, so was he a scholar in matters of the Sages,</b> i.e., the Oral Law.",
                "<b>Rabbi Ḥaggai</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: The former</b> Sages, i.e., the scholars of earlier generations, metaphorically <b>plowed and planted, weeded, cleared</b> thorns, <b>hoed, harvested, gathered</b> sheaves into a pile, <b>threshed</b> the sheaves, <b>winnowed</b> the threshed grain, <b>separated</b> the bad grain form the good, <b>ground</b> the remainder into flour, <b>sifted</b> the flour in a sieve, <b>kneaded</b> the dough, <b>smoothed</b> the surface of the unbaked loaves with liquid, <b>and baked</b> the bread. They prepared everything so that we should be able to grasp Torah concepts; <b>and</b> yet, after all that, <b>we have nothing to eat,</b> as we are still unable to understand the Torah properly. The Gemara cites another metaphor with regard to the relationship between the earlier and later generations. <b>Rabbi Abba bar Zemina</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Ze’eira: If the former</b> generations were akin to <b>angels, we are</b> akin to <b>humans; and if they were</b> akin to <b>humans, we are</b> akin to <b>donkeys.

                "§ The Gemara explains the reference to this particular donkey. <b>The donkey of Rabbi Pineḥas ben Yair was stolen by robbers one night.

They said: Let’s get it out of here, so that it shouldn’t die in our possession</b> and leave a stench in our cave. When <b>they set it free it went and stood by its master’s gate</b> and <b>began braying.</b> Rabbi Pineḥas <b>said to</b> the members of his household: <b>Open up for that poor</b> creature, <b>which has gone three days without eating anything.

                "§ The mishna states that <b>Petaḥya</b> was responsible <b>for the pairs</b> of birds. The Gemara mentions some of the talents of this Petaḥya. <b>Come and see how great was the skill of that man.</b> He could <b>open,</b> i.e., elucidate, difficult <b>topics and interpret them.</b> As mentioned in the mishna, <b>he understood</b> all <b>seventy languages.</b> The Gemara adds: <b>It was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: A Sanhedrin that includes two</b> members <b>who are able to speak</b> all the seventy languages, <b>and all</b> of its members <b>are</b> at least <b>capable of understanding</b> those languages, this court <b>is</b> minimally <b>fit to</b> serve as <b>a Sanhedrin.</b> If it has <b>three</b> who can speak those languages, <b>it is a medium</b> level Sanhedrin.

                "The Gemara cites a story that exemplifies Petaḥya’s skills at understanding linguistic allusions. <b>Rabbi Ḥisda said: Once Eretz Yisrael dried up.</b> There was a drought, no grain grew there, <b>and</b> the Sages <b>did not know from where they could bring the <i>omer</i>,</b> the measure of barley brought as a communal offering on the sixteenth of Nisan. <b>And there was a mute</b> present <b>there who</b> knew where barley was growing that year.

He <b>placed one of his hands on roofs [<i>gagot</i>] and the other hand on huts [<i>tzerifin</i>],</b> alluding to the name of the place where barley could be found. Since they did not understand his allusions, <b>they brought Petaḥya before him, who</b> observed the actions of the mute and <b>said to them: Is there a place called Gagot Tzerifin or Tzerifin Gagot?</b> They remembered that there was indeed such a place. <b>They went there and found</b> barley for the <i>omer</i> offering. The Gemara relates a similar story. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Bun, said: Once</b> all the grain in <b>the entire world was blighted, and</b> the Sages <b>did not know from where they could bring</b> barley for <b>the <i>omer</i>. And</b> again <b>there was a mute</b> present <b>there who</b> knew where barley was growing. He came before the Sages and gestured to them with his hands. He <b>placed one hand on his eye and the other hand on a doorjamb [<i>sokhara</i>].</b> Since the Sages were unable to understand his allusions, <b>they brought Petaḥya before him, who</b> observed his actions and <b>said to them: Is there a place called Ein Sokher or Sokher Ein?</b> They remembered that there was indeed such a place. <b>They went there and found</b> barley for the <i>omer</i> offering.",
                "The Gemara cites yet another story that exemplifies Petaḥya’s deciphering skills. There were <b>three women</b> who <b>brought their</b> own <b>pair</b> of birds to the Temple. It was not clear which type of offering each of them intended to bring. <b>One</b> of the women <b>said:</b> This pair of birds is <b>for my fountain; and</b> the second <b>one said:</b> It is <b>for my sea; and</b> the third <b>one said:</b> It is <b>for my <i>ziva</i>.</b> With regard to <b>that</b> woman <b>who said: For my fountain,</b> the Rabbis <b>thought to say</b> that she meant that her post-menstrual blood was <b>flowing like a fountain.</b> She was therefore bringing the pair of birds of a <i>zava</i>, as a sin-offering and a burnt-offering for her ritual purity. However, Petaḥya <b>said to them: She was endangered in a fountain.</b> She has brought this pair of birds as a thanks-offering for her escape from that life-threatening situation. With regard to <b>that</b> woman <b>who said: For my sea,</b> the Rabbis <b>thought to say</b> that she meant that her post-menstrual blood was <b>flowing like the sea,</b> which likewise means that she was a <i>zava</i> bringing her offerings for ritual purity. But Petaḥya <b>said to them: She was endangered in the sea,</b> so she too has brought this pair of birds as a thanks-offering. Finally, with regard to <b>that</b> woman <b>who said: For my <i>ziva</i>,</b> the Rabbis <b>thought to say</b> that she meant that she was <b>an actual <i>zava</i>,</b> and she was therefore bringing an offering for ritual purity. But Petaḥya <b>said to them: A wolf [<i>ze’ev</i>],</b> a word that is similar to the one she used, <b>came</b> and attempted <b>to snatch her son,</b> but he was ultimately saved. She, too, has brought this pair of birds as a thanks-offering.",
                " § The mishna states that <b>ben Aḥiyya</b> was appointed to treat those priests who suffered from intestinal disease. The Gemara explains why priests were particularly susceptible to this ailment. <b>Since the priests would walk barefoot on the floor,</b> even when it was cold, as their feet had to be in contact with the stones of the Temple floor, <b>and</b> since <b>they would eat</b> a lot of <b>meat</b> from the offerings <b>and drink</b> a lot of <b>water, they would contract intestinal disease. And</b> ben Aḥiyya <b>knew</b> that <b>this</b> particular type of <b>wine was good for</b> healing <b>the intestines, and</b> that <b>this</b> other type of <b>wine was</b> effective <b>intestinal medicine.</b>",
                "The mishna states that <b>Neḥunya</b> was <b>the well digger.</b> The Gemara explains <b>that he would dig wells and caves,</b> where rainwater would collect, for pilgrims to use on their way to Jerusalem for the Festivals. <b>And he knew</b> <sup><b>[14a]</b></sup> <b>which rock contains water, and which rock contains fissures</b> in which water may be found, <b>and how far those fissures extend.</b> This would enable him to calculate how deep he had to dig to reach water. <b>Rabbi Eliezer said: And his son died of thirst.</b> Since the previous passage mentioned God’s rigorously exacting attitude toward righteous people like Neḥunya, the Gemara discusses how God relates to sinners. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Whoever says</b> that <b>the Merciful One overlooks</b> the punishment due to sinners, <b>his intestines will be overlooked,</b> i.e., cease functioning. The reason sinners often appear to go unpunished is <b>rather</b> that God <b>extends His patience</b> with evildoers to give them a chance to repent, <b>but</b> eventually He <b>collects His due</b> and punishes the wicked. The Gemara explains the harsh judgment inflicted on the righteous Neḥunya. <b>Rabbi Aḥa said</b> that <b>it is written:</b> “Our God comes and does not keep silence; a fire devours before Him, <b>and His surroundings storm [<i>nis’ara</i>] mightily”</b> (Psalms 50:3). The Hebrew spelling of the word <i>nis’ara</i> is very similar to the word <i>sa’ara</i>, hair. This hints that God <b>is exacting with</b> the righteous, who are close to Him and can be called His surroundings, <b>up to a hairsbreadth.</b> Even slight deviations from the proper path can elicit punishment. <b>Rabbi Yosei said:</b> This idea is derived <b>not through that source,</b> but <b>rather from that which is written</b> about God: <b>“And dreadful is He upon all of His surroundings”</b> (Psalms 89:8), which indicates that <b>His dread is upon those close</b> to Him, i.e., the righteous, <b>more than</b> upon <b>those distant</b> from Him, i.e., the sinful.",
                "The Gemara cites a related story. <b>Rabbi Ḥaggai</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman:</b> There was <b>an incident involving a certain pious man who would dig pits, wells, and caves</b> to collect water <b>for passersby. Once his daughter was passing over</b> a river <b>for</b> the purpose of <b>marriage, and</b> the <b>river washed her away. And all the people came to console him, but he refused to accept their condolences.</b> <b>Rabbi Pineḥas ben Yair came to</b> visit <b>him to console him, but he refused to accept condolences</b> even from Rabbi Pineḥas. Rabbi Pineḥas <b>said to</b> the people of that community: Is <b>this your righteous man,</b> who will not be consoled and accept God’s judgment? <b>They said to him: Rabbi, he would perform such and such</b> acts of righteousness, by supplying water, <b>and</b> yet <b>such and such</b> tragedy, the drowning of his daughter, <b>occurred to him.</b> Rabbi Pineḥas <b>said:</b> Is it <b>possible that he honors his Creator with water, and</b> yet his Creator <b>strikes him with water? Immediately</b> thereafter, <b>a report spread throughout the city: The daughter of that</b> righteous <b>man has arrived,</b> as she did not actually drown. <b>Some say she grasped a branch</b> and pulled herself out of the river, <b>and some say an angel in the form of Rabbi Pineḥas ben Yair descended</b> from heaven <b>and rescued her.</b>",
                " § The mishna states that <b>Gevini</b> was the Temple <b>crier.</b> The Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> that states <b>that</b> Gevini <b>would issue an announcement</b> every morning <b>in the Temple.

                "The mishna states that <b>ben Gever</b> was responsible <b>for locking</b> the Temple <b>gates</b> in the evening and opening them in the morning. The Gemara cites an incident involving ben Gever. It is taught in a mishna (<i>Yoma</i> 20a): On each day, the ashes are removed from the altar at the calling of the <i>gever</i> or near this time. The Sages dispute whether the term <i>gever</i> in this context means man or rooster. The Gemara relates that when Rav went to visit Rabbi Sheila, he would serve as his interpreter, explaining his lectures to the public. On one occasion, after Rabbi Sheila had explicitly stated that <i>gever</i> means a rooster, <b>Rav</b> nevertheless <b>interpreted in the</b> study <b>hall of Rabbi Sheila</b> that the phrase: <b><i>Gever</i> cried out,</b> means: <b>The crier announced.</b> Rabbi Sheila <b>said to him: Say</b> that this expression means: <b>The rooster cried out.</b> Rav <b>said to him: But we learned</b> in a mishna above (13a) that there is a man called <b>ben Gever. Could you</b> possibly <b>say</b> that his name means <b>son of a rooster?</b> In this context, <i>gever</i> must mean man, not rooster. Therefore, in <i>Yoma</i> as well it must indicate that a man issued an announcement.",
                "The mishna states that <b>ben Bevai</b> was responsible <b>for the shreds</b> of garments. The Gemara explains <b>that he would braid</b> shreds together to prepare <b>wicks</b> for the candelabrum that were of the appropriate thickness, so that they would burn the entire night during each period of the year. The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Yosei came to</b> the town of <b>Kufra</b> and <b>wanted to appoint</b> community <b>leaders for them</b> to care for the needs of the community and the provisions of the poor. <b>However,</b> those who were selected <b>would not accept</b> the appointment <b>from them,</b> i.e., from Rabbi Yosei, because they deemed this job beneath their dignity.

You should therefore accept the request without hesitation.",
                " The mishna further taught that <b>ben Arza</b> was responsible <b>for the cymbal.</b> The Gemara explains that this is referring to <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Tamid</i> 33b): When the High Priest bent over to pour the wine libation, the <b>deputy</b> High Priest <b>waved the scarves</b> as a signal <b>and ben Arza beat upon the cymbal.</b>",
                " The mishna states that <b>Hugras ben Levi</b> was responsible <b>for the song. Rabbi Aḥa said: He knew an extraordinary manner of singing. And they said of Hugras ben Levi that he would make his voice pleasant in song, and when he would stick his thumb into his mouth he could produce several types of music</b> simultaneously, <b>and all of his fellow priests would lurch toward him all at once,</b> from the intensity and the charm of the sound.",
                "§ The mishna mentioned that <b>the house of Garmu</b> was responsible <b>for the preparation of the shewbread,</b> which is the bread baked each week in a special form and displayed for a week on the designated table in the Sanctuary. The Gemara relates a story from a <i>baraita</i> about the house of Garmu and their talent in baking. <b>The house of Garmu was proficient in the preparation of the shewbread and in its removal</b> from the oven without ruining it, <b>but they did not want to teach</b> these skills to others. Therefore, <b>the Sages sent</b> messengers <b>and brought in craftsmen from Alexandria, who were</b> also <b>proficient in the preparation of the shewbread,</b> in an attempt to replace the house of Garmu. <b>However, they were not as proficient as</b> the house of Garmu <b>in its removal</b> from the oven. The complex form of the shewbread rendered it very difficult to remove from the oven without its breaking. The Gemara clarifies the difference between the two manners of preparation. <b>The house of Garmu would ignite</b> the fire <b>within</b> the oven, bake the shewbread in a mold, <b>and remove</b> the bread from the mold only <b>outside</b> the oven, after it was fully baked. <b>And,</b> as they would remove it from the mold at this late stage, <b>it would not spoil. Whereas these</b> Egyptian craftsmen <b>would ignite</b> the fire <b>within</b> the oven and bake the shewbread in the mold, <b>but,</b> out of fear that it would break when removed from the mold, they would <b>remove</b> it from the mold <b>inside</b> the oven before it was fully baked. <b>And</b> the result was that the bread <b>would spoil.</b> <b>Once the Sages realized this matter,</b> that their replacement shewbread was flawed, <b>they said: Everything that the Holy One, Blessed be He, created, He created for His glory, as it is stated: “The Lord has made everything for His own purpose”</b> (Proverbs 16:4). Since spoiled shewbread does not promote the glory of God, we must forgo our honor and request the services of the house of Garmu once again. Therefore, the Sages <b>sent for</b> the house of Garmu, <b>but they did not want to come</b> back to bake <b>until</b> the Sages <b>doubled their compensation. They had been receiving twelve <i>maneh</i>, and</b> now <b>they gave them twenty-four.

The house of Garmu <b>said to them: We have a tradition from our fathers that this House,</b> the Temple, <b>will be destroyed.</b> We do not want to teach our method, so <b>that others should not learn</b> this art and unscrupulously <b>perform</b> it <b>for their idolatry.</b> Although their reason for refraining from teaching their method to others was not accepted, <b>on this</b> other <b>matter</b> the Sages <b>did mention them with praise: That refined bread was never found in their children’s possession at all,</b> so <b>that</b> people <b>should not say</b> that <b>they feast upon their shewbread labor.</b>",
                "The mishna states that <b>the house of Avtinas</b> was responsible <b>for the preparation of the incense.</b> The Gemara relates a similar story from a <i>baraita</i> concerning the house of Avtinas and their knowledge of the incense preparation: <b>The house of Avtinas was proficient in the preparations of the incense mixture,</b> which included grinding the incense herbs and blending them together. And they were also expert in identifying the so-called <b>smoke raiser,</b> a plant that caused the incense smoke to rise upward in a straight line to the ceiling, <b>but they did not want to teach</b> these skills to others. Therefore, the Sages <b>sent</b> out messengers <b>and brought in craftsmen from Alexandria in Egypt. And</b> these craftsmen <b>were proficient in the incense mixture, but they were not proficient in</b> identifying <b>the smoke raiser.</b> The incense smoke <b>of the house of Avtinas would rise straight up like a staff</b> to the ceiling, <b>and</b> from there it would <b>spread out</b> and <b>descend, whereas</b> the incense smoke <b>of these</b> Egyptian craftsmen <b>would</b> not rise but <b>would</b> simply <b>spread out immediately.</b> <b>Once the Sages realized this matter,</b> that this incense smoke was flawed, <b>they said: Everything that the Holy One, Blessed be He, created, He created for His glory, as it is stated: “Everything that is called by My name, and I have created for My glory,</b> I have formed it and even made it” (Isaiah 43:7). Since incense smoke that rises straight up is superior, we must forgo our honor and request the services of the house of Avtinas once again. The Sages <b>sent for them, but they did not want to come back until they doubled their compensation. They had been receiving twelve <i>maneh</i>, and</b> now <b>they gave them twenty-four. Rabbi Yehuda says: They had been receiving twenty-four</b> <i>maneh</i>, <b>and</b> now <b>they gave them forty-eight.</b> The Sages <b>said to them: For what</b> reason <b>don’t you want to teach</b> the art of incense preparation to others? The house of Avtinas <b>said to them: We have a tradition from our fathers that this House,</b> the Temple, <b>will be destroyed.</b> We do not want to teach our method, so <b>that others should not learn</b> these skills <b>and prepare this</b> incense <b>for their idolatry.</b> Although their reason for refraining from teaching their method to others was not accepted, <b>on these</b> other <b>matters</b> the Sages <b>did mention them with praise: That never did the wife of</b> any <b>one of them leave</b> her house <b>perfumed; and not only that, but when one of them would marry a woman from elsewhere, he would stipulate with her</b> that the marriage was <b>on condition that she</b> may <b>not perfume herself,</b> so <b>that</b> people <b>should not say</b> that <b>they perfume themselves from the preparation of the incense mixture.</b> They did so <b>to fulfill that which is stated: “Then you shall be clear before the Lord and before Israel”</b> (Numbers 32:22).",

I said to him: My son, why did you cry? He said to me:</b> I cried <b>for the glory of</b> my <b>father’s house, which has been diminished</b> after the destruction of the Temple. I subsequently asked him: <b>And why did you laugh? He said to me:</b> I laughed with joy <b>over the glory prepared for the righteous in the future,</b> when my family will have its role restored to them in the rebuilt Temple. Shimon ben Loga added that he asked that child further: <b>And what did you see</b> that brought these things to mind? He replied: I saw the <b>smoke raiser before me,</b> among the herbs we were collecting. <b>I said to him: My son, show it to me,</b> and I will keep its identity secret so that no one will be able to use it for idolatry. <b>He said to me: Rabbi, I have a tradition from my forefathers not to show it to a soul.</b> Similarly, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri said:</b> Once <b>I and a certain elderly man were collecting herbs.

                "<strong>Halakha 3 · MISHNA</strong> This mishna provides details of the functions performed by Yoḥanan ben Pineḥas and Aḥiyya, the officials mentioned in the first mishna of this chapter, which concerns the seals and libations. <b>There were four seals in the Temple</b> that confirmed that the bearer had paid for the libations that accompanied his offering. <b>And</b> one of the following inscriptions was <b>written on them: Calf; male,</b> i.e., a ram; <b>kid; and sinner,</b> i.e., a leper, as leprosy is a punishment for one of seven sins (see <i>Arakhin</i> 16a). Conversely, <b>ben Azzai says: There were five</b> seals, <b>and</b> the following was <b>written upon them</b> in <b>Aramaic,</b> not Hebrew: <b>Calf, male, kid, poor sinner, and rich sinner.</b> The mishna explains the significance of each of the four aforementioned seals. The <b>calf</b> seal <b>serves</b> as a payment receipt <b>for libations of cattle</b> offerings, whether they are <b>large or small, male or female,</b> as all offerings from the cow family are accompanied by the same libation. The <b>kid</b> seal <b>serves for libations of sheep</b> or goat offerings, whether <b>large or small, male or female, except for those of rams</b> aged thirteen months and older. The <b>ram</b> seal, which was earlier called the male seal, <b>serves exclusively for ram libations.</b> The <b>sinner</b> seal <b>serves for libations of the three animal</b> offerings <b>of a leper,</b> for the completion of his purification. <b>One who seeks libations</b> for his offering <b>goes to Yoḥanan,</b> the official <b>who was responsible for the seals, and gives him</b> the appropriate sum of <b>money and receives a seal from him.</b> With that seal <b>he</b> subsequently <b>comes to Aḥiyya, who was responsible for the libations, and gives him</b> Yoḥanan’s <b>seal and receives</b> his <b>libations from him.</b> <b>In the evening,</b> Yoḥanan and Aḥiyya <b>would get together</b> to reconcile their accounts, <b>and Aḥiyya would take out the seals</b> he had received <b>and accept the money</b> Yoḥanan had received <b>in exchange for them. If</b> the money <b>was less</b> than the value of the seals, <b>they were less to him,</b> i.e., Yoḥanan would bear the loss, <b>and Yoḥanan would</b> have to <b>pay</b> the difference to the Temple treasury <b>from his own</b> property. <b>And if</b> there was some money <b>left over,</b> i.e., the total money was greater than the value of the seals, <b>they</b> were <b>left over to</b> the benefit of <b>the Temple treasury of consecrated property, as the Temple treasury</b> always <b>has the upper hand.</b> With regard to <b>one who lost his seal</b> that he purchased from Yoḥanan, Yoḥanan and <b>Aḥiyya would wait to</b> resolve <b>his</b> problem <b>until the evening. And</b> when they added their accounts in the evening, <b>if they found for him</b> a surplus of money <b>equivalent to</b> the value of <b>his seal, they would give him</b> the corresponding libations. <b>And if not, they would not give him</b> libations. <b>And the name of the day</b> of the week <b>was written upon</b> the seals <b>because of the cheats.</b> They might try to use old seals that had been lost by the Temple officials or by someone who had brought an offering at an earlier date, so as to receive libations in a deceitful manner.",
                "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>ben Azzai, why</b> was it necessary to have a seal labeled <b>poor sinner?</b> The Gemara answers: Ben Azzai maintains that a poor leper <b>would</b> have to <b>bring his <i>log</i></b> of oil <b>with him.</b> This is referring to the additional oil required for the leper’s purification (Leviticus 14:15–18), some of which is sprinkled on the altar while the rest is applied to the leper’s ear, thumb, big toe, and head. According to ben Azzai, a leper would purchase this additional oil from Aḥiyya, and therefore he required a separate seal for each <i>log</i> of oil. <b>However, according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> a poor leper <b>brings</b> only the <b>kid</b> seal purchased from Yoḥanan, by which he receives the oil for his meal offering, and he must use his own private oil for the additional <i>log</i>. The mishna mentions only the libations for kids, referring to both sheep and goats that are less than one year old, and for rams, which are adult male sheep. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> amounts are brought for <b>the libations of a lamb,</b> i.e., a female sheep in its second year? Are they the same as those of a kid or a ram? The Gemara answers that this <i>halakha</i> may be inferred <b>from that which we learned</b> in the mishna, that the <b>kid</b> seal <b>serves for libations of sheep</b> offerings, whether <b>large or small, male or female. That</b> ruling <b>says,</b> i.e., indicates, that <b>the libations of a lamb are like the libations of a kid.</b> The Gemara adds that this is derived from a verse that equates the two libations, <b>as it is written: “Thus shall it be done for each bull, or for each ram, or for each of the lambs, or of the kids”</b> (Numbers 15:11). The Gemara inquires further: <b>Why is it stated: For each bull?</b> The verse <b>teaches that</b> The Torah <b>does not differentiate between the libations of a calf,</b> which is less than a year old, <b>and the libations of a bull,</b> which is at least one year old. The Gemara explains: This is <b>because it was fitting</b> to differentiate between them, in light of the fact that both <b>the offspring of a sheep requires libations and the offspring of a cow requires libations. If we find that</b> the Torah <b>differentiates between the libations of a sheep</b> in its first year, whose meal offering is one <i>isaron</i> of fine flour, <b>and the libations of a ram,</b> a male sheep thirteen months old and older, whose meal-offering is two <i>isaron</i>, <sup><b>[15a]</b></sup> <b>then we</b> should likewise <b>differentiate between the libations of a calf and the libations of a bull.</b> In order to indicate that this is not the case, <b>the</b> aforementioned <b>verse states: “Thus shall it be done for each bull,”</b> which <b>teaches that</b> the Torah <b>does not differentiate between the libations of a calf and the libations of a bull.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why does</b> the verse <b>state: “Or for</b> each <b>ram,”</b> as the details of the ram libations were specified in the previous verses (Numbers 15:6–7)? The Gemara explains that this verse is necessary <b>because it would be fitting</b> to argue as follows: <b>If we have found that</b> the Torah <b>differentiated between the libations of a one-year-old</b> sheep <b>and the libations of a two-year-old</b> sheep, i.e., a sheep in its second year, which is already called a ram, <b>then we</b> should <b>differentiate between the libations of a</b> two-year-old <b>and the libations of a</b> three-year-old ram. In order to indicate that this is not the case, <b>the verse states: “Or for each ram,”</b> which teaches that the libations for rams of all ages are identical. The Gemara similarly asks: <b>Why does</b> the verse <b>state: “Or for each of the lambs,”</b> as the details of the lamb libations were provided in the previous verses (Numbers 15:4–5)? The Gemara explains that this phrase is necessary <b>because it would be fitting</b> to argue as follows: <b>If we have found that</b> the Torah <b>differentiated between the libations of a lamb</b> in its first year <b>and the libations of ram</b> that is thirteen months or older, <b>then we</b> should likewise <b>differentiate between the libations of</b> a full-grown <b>ewe</b> in its second year <b>and the libations of a female lamb</b> in its first year. In order to indicate that this is not the case, <b>the verse states: “Or for each of the lambs,”</b> which teaches that the libations for female sheep of all ages are identical. The Gemara continues: <b>Why does</b> the verse <b>state: “Or of the goats,”</b> which are also part of the sheep family? The Gemara explains that this phrase is necessary <b>because it would be fitting</b> to argue as follows: <b>If we have found that</b> the Torah <b>differentiated between the libations of a lamb</b> in its first year <b>and the libations of a ram</b> that is thirteen months or old, <b>then we</b> should likewise <b>differentiate between the libations of a kid,</b> a young goat, <b>and the libations of a full-grown goat.</b> In order to indicate that this is not the case, <b>the verse states: “Or of the kids,”</b> and thereby <b>juxtaposes</b> the libations for <b>the youngest of the kids and</b> those of <b>the oldest of the goats: Just as</b> the libations of <b>this</b> young kid consist <b>of three <i>log</i></b> of wine, <b>so too,</b> the libations of <b>that</b> full-grown goat consist <b>of three <i>log</i>.</b>",
                "The mishna states: <b>And the name of the day</b> of the week <b>was written</b> upon the seals, to deter cheats. The Gemara points out a problem: <b>Consider</b> the following situation <b>yourself.</b> Suppose <b>that</b> a cheat found a seal and circumvented this precaution by waiting until the same day the next week, at which point he could <b>match up [<i>ziyyeig</i>]</b> his seal with <b>that day.</b> He would be able to collect the libations deceitfully a week later. The Gemara answers: <b>The name of</b> the priestly <b>watch</b> that served in the Temple that week <b>was</b> also <b>written on it,</b> as each watch serves in the Temple only twice a year. The Gemara retorts that even this is not a sufficient precaution. After all, <b>consider</b> for <b>yourself that</b> a cheat can wait half a year and <b>match up</b> with <b>that watch</b> and collect the libations. The Gemara explains that <b>the name of the day; the name,</b> i.e., the number, <b>of the week</b> within the month; and <b>the name of the month were</b> all <b>written on it.</b> Consequently, <b>even if</b> a cheat <b>wanted to match up</b> the seal with a similar day, <b>there is no</b> identical day to be <b>found</b> with which <b>to match</b> it <b>up.</b>"

Rabbi Hoshaya explained his comment: <b>Weren’t there people who would have exerted themselves in</b> the study of <b>Torah</b> if only the money used for the construction of these buildings had been donated to them instead?",

                "§ With regard to the vessels donated for the Temple maintenance, which are mentioned in the mishna, the Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> in which <b>it was taught:</b> If the shekels collected for the purchase of articles <b>consecrated for the altar,</b> i.e., communal offerings, are not enough to purchase them and the items that accompanied them, e.g., their libations, the funds <b>required for</b> purchasing the remainder <b>are taken from the funds consecrated for Temple maintenance.</b> However, the converse is not the case: If there is a need for <b>funds consecrated to Temple maintenance, that which is required for it is not taken from funds consecrated for the altar.</b> The reason for this difference is that an item may be changed from a lesser to a greater sanctity, but not vice versa. The Gemara notes an apparent contradiction. <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>A vessel that they found for it a use for Temple maintenance, they leave it</b> for that purpose; <b>and the rest are sold, and their monetary</b> value <b>is allocated to Temple maintenance.</b> This statement indicates that this money could be used only for Temple maintenance, not for items consecrated for the altar. This contradicts the <i>baraita</i> cited above. In resolution of this contradiction, <b>Rabbi Ḥizkiya said: This is</b> the intent of <b>the mishna:</b> Donated items and, likewise, any money received as payment for sale of an item are physically taken <b>to the chamber for the Temple maintenance.</b> From there they may be removed for any Temple purpose, either for the maintenance of the Temple or for articles consecrated for the altar.

                " <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Those</b> collection <b>horns were asymmetrical.</b> They were <b>narrow at the top and wide at the bottom.</b> Why were they shaped like that? It was <b>due to cheaters,</b> to prevent them from inserting their hands on the pretense of adding shekels and removing them instead.",
                "The Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> that expounds a tannaitic dispute with regard to the sequestering of the Ark, a topic mentioned in the mishna: <b>It was taught in the name of Rabbi Elazar: The Ark was exiled with</b> the Jews <b>to Babylonia.</b> When the Jews were exiled to Babylonia, they took the Ark with them. <b>What is the source</b> for this statement? When Isaiah prophesied about the exile before King Hezekiah, he stated: “Behold, the days come, that all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have stored up until this day, shall be carried to Babylon; <b>no item shall be left, said the Lord”</b> (II Kings 20:17). The <b>item [<i>davar</i>]</b> referred to in the verse can <b>only be</b> an item <b>that contains the commandments [<i>dibrot</i>].</b> That is the Ark, which contains the two tablets upon which the Ten Commandments are carved. <b>And, so</b> too, <b>it says: “And at the return of the year, King Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the desired vessels of the House of the Lord,</b> and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem” (II Chronicles 36:10). <b>What is</b> referred to by the phrase <b>“the desired vessels of the House of the Lord”? This is the Ark,</b> in which the Tablets of the Law were placed. The Torah is a desirable object for the Jews, as it is stated, “More to be desired are they than gold, indeed, than much fine gold” (Psalms 19:11). <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish</b> differs and <b>says: The Ark</b> was not sent into exile, but rather <b>was sequestered in its place,</b> i.e., buried in the Holy of Holies. <b>This is as it is written: “And the staves were so long that the ends of the staves were seen from the holy place, even before the Sanctuary; but they could not be seen without;</b> and there they are until this day” (I Kings 8:8). The phrase “until this day” means forever, as “this day” can refer to any point in time. Consequently, this verse indicates that the Ark was sequestered in its place. Having cited this verse, the Gemara proceeds to further explain it, by pointing out an internal contradiction in the verse. Initially, <b>it is written:</b> “The ends of the staves <b>were seen,” and you say,</b> in the continuation of the verse, <b>“but they could not be seen.”</b> How can that be? <b>Rather,</b> the verse should be understood as follows: The staves <b>could be seen and</b> they <b>could not be seen, as they protruded outward</b> through the curtain <b>like the two breasts of a woman.</b> The staves themselves could not be seen, but their position was discernible from the protrusion of the curtain.",
                " The Gemara returns to the discussion of the location of the Ark during the Second Temple period. <b>And the Rabbis say: The Ark was sequestered in the wood depository chamber.</b> The Gemara relates that there was <b>an incident involving a certain blemished priest who was standing and splitting wood in the wood depository chamber</b> in order to verify that the wood was not infested with worms. <b>And he saw the flagstone that was different from the others. He came and said to his fellow: Come and see that this flagstone differs from the others. He did not manage to conclude</b> relating <b>the incident before his soul left him. And they knew with certainty that the Ark was sequestered there. Rabbi Hoshaya taught</b> a slightly different version of the story in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>He tapped on</b> the stone <b>with a mallet [<i>kurenas</i>]</b> to determine if it was hollow underneath the stone, <b>and fire came out and burned him.</b>",
                "The Gemara elaborates on the topic of the Ark of the Covenant. <b>It was taught</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Lakish said: Two Arks would travel with Israel in the desert: One, in which the Torah,</b> i.e., the second tablets that were given to Moses after he broke the first ones, <b>was placed, and the other, in which the shards of</b> the first <b>tablets were placed. That in which the Torah was kept,</b> was the Ark that <b>was placed in the Tent of Meeting,</b> in the Holy of Holies. <b>This is as it is written: “And the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, and Moses, departed not out of the camp”</b> (Numbers 14:44). <b>The one in which the shards of</b> the <b>tablets were placed would embark and return with them</b> when they went to war. Consequently, <b>there were times that it would be seen among them.</b> <b>And the Rabbis say: There was</b> only <b>one Ark,</b> not two, kept in the Holy of Holies. <b>And one time it went out</b> with the nation to battle <b>in the days of Eli and it was captured.</b> The Gemara notes that <b>a verse supports</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis:</b> When the Philistines who captured the Ark saw it, they said: <b>“Woe unto us! Who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods?”</b> (I Samuel 4:8). It is clear that they were very frightened, and it would seem that this was due to the fact that the Ark was <b>something that they had never seen in all their days.</b> There is also <b>a verse</b> that <b>supports</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yuda ben Lakish</b> that there were two Arks, one that they took with them into battle and one that remained in its place. Apropos the battle of King Saul with the Philistines, the verse states: <b>“And Saul said unto Ahijah: Bring here the Ark of God,</b> for the Ark of God was there at that time with the children of Israel” (I Samuel 14:18). This is puzzling. <b>Wasn’t the Ark in Kiryat Ye’arim</b> at the time (see I Samuel 7:1–2)? Therefore, it is clear that there were two Arks, one that resided in Kiryat Ye’arim and a different one that they took with them to battle. <b>What do the Rabbis do with this</b> verse so that it does not contradict their opinion? The Rabbis would interpret the verse as follows: Saul said, <b>“Bring here”</b> the container that contains the eight priestly garments, among them <b>the frontplate.</b> The verse is referring to this container, not the Ark. A different <b>verse supports</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yuda ben Lakish</b> that there were two Arks: When Uriah explains to King David why he will not return to his house while there is a war with the children of Ammon, he says: <b>“The Ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in booths;</b> and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open field; shall I then go into my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife?” (II Samuel 11:11). <sup><b>[16a]</b></sup> <b>But wasn’t the Ark in Zion,</b> i.e., Jerusalem, at the time, and not in a booth at the battlefield? Rather, there must have been two Arks; one remained in Jerusalem and the other went out with the Jews to the battlefield. <b>What do the Rabbis do with this</b> verse? How would they interpret it according to their opinion that there was only one Ark, and it remained in Jerusalem? The word for booth, <i>sukka</i>, is related to the word <b><i>sekhakh</i>, which is</b> temporary <b>roofing</b> for a structure. The verse, in mentioning that the Ark was in a booth, is not implying that it was with the army at the battlefield, but merely that the Ark was in a temporary structure, <b>as the Temple had not yet been built.</b>",
                "§ As the mishna mentions the subject of concealing the Ark, the Gemara cites a further <i>baraita</i> on this topic: <b>When the Ark was sequestered, sequestered along with it was the canister of manna</b> that Moses placed before God to be kept throughout the generations (see Exodus 16:32–34); <b>the flask of the anointing oil; Aaron’s staff with its blossoms and berries,</b> which were placed before the Ark (see Numbers 17:23); <b>and the box that the Philistines returned</b> together with the Ark that was captured during the war, which they filled with golden vessels <b>as a guilt-offering to the God of Israel,</b> as the verse says: “And put the jewels of gold, which you return Him for a guilt-offering, in a coffer by the side thereof” (I Samuel 6:8). <b>Who sequestered</b> the Ark? <b>Josiah,</b> king of Judah, sequestered it. <b>Since he saw that it is written, “The Lord will bring you and your king, whom you shall set over you, to a nation that you have not known, you nor your fathers”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:36), <b>he arose and sequestered it,</b> so that it would not be sent into exile with the Jews. <b>This is as it is written: “And he said unto the Levites who taught all Israel, who were holy unto the Lord: Put the Holy Ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; there shall no more be a burden upon your shoulders;</b> now serve the Lord your God, and His people Israel” (II Chronicles 35:3). The Gemara explains: Josiah <b>said to</b> the Levites: <b>If</b> the Ark <b>is exiled with you to Babylonia,</b> there is a real concern that <b>you will never return it to its place. Rather,</b> I am concealing it so you will no longer need to carry it. <b>“Now serve the Lord your God, and His people Israel”</b> (II Chronicles 35:3) in the other tasks that are incumbent upon you.",
                "§ Apropos the anointing oil mentioned among the items sequestered with the Ark, the Gemara elaborates: The types and quantities of spices that were used in the <b>blending of the anointing oil</b> are detailed in the verses: <b>“Take you also unto yourself</b> the chief spices, of flowing myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty, <b>and of cassia [<i>kidda</i>] five hundred,</b> after the shekel of the Sanctuary” (Exodus 30:23–24). All together, <b>they</b> total <b>1,500 <i>maneh</i>.</b> The Gemara explains in a <i>baraita</i> how this was done: <b>“And of olive oil a <i>hin</i>”</b> (Exodus 30:24), this <i>hin</i> equals <b>twelve <i>log</i></b> of oil <b>in which they would cook the roots</b> of the plants mentioned in the verse above, so that the oil would absorb their fragrance; <b>this is the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> That is not how it was prepared. Rather, the priest who prepared the oil <b>would cook</b> the roots <b>in water,</b> such that the fragrant essence would rise to the top, <b>and</b> he would then <b>place oil on top of</b> the water. <b>When it had</b> completely <b>absorbed the fragrance, he would remove</b> the oil from the water, <b>in the manner that the perfumers prepare</b> fragrant oils. The accepted way of extracting fragrances was to boil the plants in water and then place the oil on top to absorb the fragrance essences. <b>This is as it is written:</b> “And you shall make it <b>a holy anointing oil,</b> a perfume compounded after the art of the perfumer; it shall be a holy anointing oil” (Exodus 30:25). “After the art of the perfumer” indicates that it should be prepared in the manner of those who make such perfumes.",
                "Continuing on the subject of the anointing oil, <b>Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Elai, taught: The anointing oil that Moses prepared in the desert was a miraculous feat from beginning to end. At the outset, there were only twelve <i>log</i></b> of oil, <b>as it is stated: “And of olive oil a <i>hin</i>,”</b> and a <i>hin</i> is twelve <i>log</i>. <b>If there</b> initially <b>wasn’t</b> even <b>enough</b> oil <b>to pour over the roots, all the more so after the fire absorbs</b> some oil, as it reduces the amount of oil through cooking, <b>and the wood,</b> i.e., the roots from which the fragrant essence was extracted, <b>absorbs</b> some oil, <b>and the pot</b> in which the roots were cooked absorbs some oil as well. <b>Yet from this</b> small amount <b>were anointed the Tabernacle and all its vessels, the table and all its vessels, and the candelabrum and all its vessels. And from that</b> oil <b>Aaron the High Priest and his sons were anointed during all the seven days of consecration, and from that</b> oil <b>the High Priests and kings</b> throughout all the generations <b>were anointed.</b> The <i>baraita</i> goes on to discuss those who were anointed with the anointing oil. <b>A king at the outset,</b> i.e., when his appointment as king begins a dynasty, <b>requires anointing</b> with the anointing oil. <b>A king</b> who is the <b>son of a king,</b> who stands to reign in his father’s place, <b>does not require anointing. What is the source</b> for this ruling? God instructed Samuel with regard to David: <b>“Arise, anoint him; for this is he”</b> (I Samuel 16:12). Only <b>“this”</b> one, i.e., David, <b>requires anointing,</b> as his monarchy begins a dynasty, <b>but his son does not require anointing.</b> In contrast to the anointing of kings, with regard to <b>a High Priest, son of a High Priest, even up to ten generations</b> or more of High Priests of fathers and sons, each one <b>requires anointing,</b> as the position of High Priest is not passed as an inheritance from father to son like the monarchy. Rabbi Yehuda concludes his statement about the miraculous nature of the anointing oil, adding that despite the reduction in the amount of oil during its preparation process, as well as its multiple uses throughout history, <b>it all</b> will remain <b>intact in the future</b> that will surely <b>come. This is as it is written: “This [<i>zeh</i>] shall be a holy anointing oil unto Me throughout your generations”</b> (Exodus 30:31). The word <i>zeh</i> has a numerical value of twelve, which teaches that the original twelve <i>log</i> of oil that existed at the outset will remain throughout all the generations.",
                "§ The Gemara continues the discussion of anointing kings, citing an additional <i>baraita</i> on the subject. <b>One</b> may <b>anoint kings only next to a spring.</b> It is a fortuitous sign that their monarchy should continue uninterrupted just as the waters of the spring flow uninterrupted throughout the year, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the coronation of Solomon in the days of King David: “And the king said unto them: Take with you the servants of your lord, <b>and cause Solomon my son to ride upon my own mule, and bring him down to Giḥon. And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel”</b> (I Kings 1:33–34). From this verse, the Sages learned that all kings should be anointed near a spring, just as David instructed that the anointing of Solomon take place near the Giḥon spring. Another <i>baraita</i> states: <b>One</b> only <b>anoints a king, son of a king, due to a dispute</b> over the monarchy. For example, <b>why was Solomon anointed,</b> despite the fact that he was the son of a king? It was <b>because of the dispute</b> over the throne instigated <b>by</b> his older brother <b>Adonijah,</b> who attempted to usurp the monarchy. Similarly, <b>Joash,</b> son of Ahaziah, was anointed as king (see II Kings 11:12) <b>due to</b> the threat of <b>Athaliah,</b> his paternal grandmother, who attempted to seize the monarchy for herself (II Kings 11:1–3). <b>Jehoahaz,</b> son of Josiah, was anointed (II Kings 23:30) <b>due to</b> the competition from <b>Jehoiakim, his brother, who was older than him by two years.</b> Ordinarily, the older brother should have succeeded their father, but Jehoahaz was more worthy of the throne. <b>Jehu,</b> son of Jehoshaphat, was anointed <b>due to Joram,</b> son of Ahab, who was the incumbent king, and Jehu rebelled against his rule (see II Kings 9:6). The Gemara presents a difficulty concerning the latter example cited previously: Why was Jehu anointed as king? <b>Isn’t it written</b> with regard to the anointing of David: <b>“Arise, anoint him; for this is he”</b> (I Samuel 16:12)? <b>This</b> king, i.e., any king from the house of David, <b>requires anointing, but the kings</b> from the kingdom <b>of Israel,</b> who were not descendants of the house of David, <b>do not require anointing.</b> Jehu, a king of Israel, should not have required anointing. The Gemara presents a counter-question: According to that line of reasoning, there is a further difficulty in the <i>baraita</i>. How can one explain that <b>Jehoahaz</b> was anointed <b>due to</b> the competition from <b>Jehoiakim his brother, who was older than him by two years? Didn’t Josiah,</b> their father, <b>sequester</b> the anointing oil as was explained previously? How then was there oil available to anoint Jehoahaz, his son? Rather, when the <i>baraita</i> says that Jehoahaz was anointed, <b>that is to say</b> that <b>he was anointed with balsam</b> oil and not with the anointing oil. Similarly, one can say that Jehu was also anointed with balsam oil and not with the anointing oil. It was further taught that <b>one</b> may <b>anoint kings only</b> with anointing oil that is poured <b>from a horn,</b> and not any other vessel. <b>Saul and Jehu were anointed from</b> oil poured from an earthenware <b>cruse,</b> and <b>their monarchy was a temporary monarchy. David and Solomon were anointed</b> with oil poured <b>from a horn,</b> and <b>their monarchy was a monarchy that was established</b> for many generations. <b>One</b> may <b>not anoint priests</b> to serve <b>as kings</b> <i>ab initio</i>. <b>Rabbi Yuda Antondraya said</b> that this rule is <b>on account of</b> the verse that states: <b>“The scepter shall not depart from Judah”</b> (Genesis 49:10), i.e., the scepter of monarchy will forever belong to the tribe of Judah and not to any other tribe. Therefore, the priests who are from the tribe of Levi may not be appointed as kings. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Adda said</b> that this rule is derived from a different verse, as it is written: <b>“To the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he and his children, in the midst of Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:20). <b>What is written</b> in the <b>subsequent</b> verse? <b>“The priests the Levites, even all the tribe of Levi, shall have no</b> portion nor inheritance with Israel” (Deuteronomy 18:1). This implies that the priests will have no part in that which is referred to previously, i.e., the monarchy.",
                "It was taught previously that Jehoahaz was anointed king, despite the fact that his brother Jehoiakim was older. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The one who is called <b>Johanan</b> in the verse, “And the sons of Josiah: The firstborn Johanan, the second Jehoiakim, the third Zedekiah, the fourth Shallum” (I Chronicles 3:15), <b>he</b> is the same as the one called <b>Jehoahaz. But isn’t it written</b> in that verse <b>“the firstborn Johanan,”</b> and it was just stated that Jehoiakim was two years older than Jehoahaz? The Gemara explains that in calling Jehoahaz firstborn, the verse means that he was the <b>first</b> to rise <b>to the monarchy. Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> continued and <b>said: He</b> who is called <b>Shallum</b> is the same as <b>he</b> who is called <b>Zedekiah.</b> The Gemara challenges this statement: <b>But isn’t it written: “The third Zedekiah, the fourth Shallum,”</b> indicating that these are two different people? The Gemara explains the verse is as follows: He was the <b>third in birth position, but he was fourth to</b> achieve <b>kingship,</b> as his two brothers, Jehoahaz and Jehoiakim, as well as his nephew, Jehoiachin, all ruled before him. The Gemara cites an additional <i>baraita</i> that discusses these names: He was called <b>Zedekiah because he accepted [<i>tzideik</i>] upon himself the attribute of judgment</b> when the king of Babylonia had Zedekiah’s sons slaughtered in front of him and then proceeded to have his eyes gouged out. Zedekiah justified the punishment that God had inflicted upon him. He was called <b>Shallum</b> because <b>in his days the kingdom of the house of David was completed [<i>shalma</i>],</b> as he was the last king in King David’s dynasty. <b>Reish Lakish said: His name was not Shallum and his name was not Zedekiah; rather,</b> his name was <b>Mattaniah. This is as it is written: “And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah, his father’s brother, king in his stead and changed his name to Zedekiah”</b> (II Kings 24:17). This verse indicates that the king of Babylonia changed his name to Zedekiah, but it was not his original name.",
                "§ The Gemara turns to a discussion of the measurements of the Ark. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The Ark was constructed with a cubit of six handbreadths.</b> The unit of measurement used in the Torah to describe the Ark, the cubit, equaled six handbreadths. <b>Who is the <i>tanna</i></b> that holds that the Ark was constructed <b>using cubits of six handbreadths? It is Rabbi Meir, as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Rabbi Meir says: All the cubits that</b> are mentioned in the Torah <b>were medium-</b>sized cubits six handbreadths in length. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that <b>cubits</b> used for measuring <b>the building,</b> such as the walls or the gates, were of <b>six</b> handbreadths. However, cubits used for measuring <b>the vessels,</b> such as the Ark, were of <b>five</b> handbreadths. <b>According to the opinion of Rabbi Meir, who said</b> that <b>the Ark was constructed using a cubit of six handbreadths, the length of the Ark was fifteen handbreadths, as it is written: “Two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof”</b> (Exodus 25:10). <b>A cubit is six</b> handbreadths, <b>and</b> another <b>cubit is six</b> handbreadths, <b>and a half-cubit is three</b> handbreadths. This totals fifteen handbreadths. <b>And four tablets were</b> placed <b>in</b> the Ark, <b>two</b> tablets were <b>whole and two</b> tablets were <b>broken, as it is written:</b> “And I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets <b>which you did break, and you shall put them in the Ark”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:2). The juxtaposition of these phrases teaches that the broken tablets were also placed in the Ark. <b>The length of each one of the tablets was six handbreadths, and its width was six handbreadths. Lay the length of the tablets across the length of the Ark,</b> and <b>three handbreadths remain there.</b> The length of the Ark was fifteen handbreadths, and the length of the two tablets together was twelve handbreadths; there were three remaining handbreadths available at the end of the Ark. <sup><b>[16b]</b></sup> <b>Give,</b> i.e., subtract, <b>from</b> those remaining three handbreadths <b>a half-handbreadth for</b> the width of <b>each wall</b> of the Ark. <b>There remain two handbreadths</b> in which to place <b>the Torah scroll</b> that Moses wrote (see <i>Bava Batra</i> 14a). <b>The width of the Ark was nine handbreadths, as it is written: “And a cubit and a half the breadth thereof”</b> (Exodus 25:10). <b>A cubit is six</b> handbreadths, <b>and a half-cubit is three</b> handbreadths. Therefore, the total width of the Ark is nine handbreadths. <b>And four tablets were</b> placed <b>in</b> the Ark, <b>two</b> tablets were <b>whole and two</b> tablets were <b>broken.</b> What is the source for the fact that the broken tablets were placed in the Ark? <b>As it is written:</b> “And I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets <b>which you did break, and you shall put them in the Ark”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:2). <b>The length of each one of the tablets was six handbreadths and their width was six handbreadths.</b> If one <b>lays the width of the tablets across the width of the Ark, three handbreadths remains there: A half-handbreadth from here,</b> on one side, <b>for</b> the thickness of <b>this wall, and a half-handbreadth from here,</b> on the other side, <b>for</b> the thickness of <b>that wall, and two handbreadths for handling</b> [<b><i>shilut</i></b>] <b>in the place where the Torah scroll was placed.</b> It was necessary to leave this space around the Torah scroll in order to allow the insertion and removal of the Torah scroll with ease. This is the opinion of Rabbi Meir that is adopted by Rabbi Yoḥanan.",
                "<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish</b> disagrees with Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion. He <b>said: The Ark was constructed using a cubit of five handbreadths. Who is the <i>tanna</i></b> that holds that the Ark was constructed <b>using a cubit of five handbreadths?</b> It is <b>Rabbi Yehuda. As we learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Kelim</i> 17:10): <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The <b>cubit</b> used as the unit of measurement for <b>the construction</b> of the walls and the gates was of <b>six</b> handbreadths; the cubit for <b>the vessels</b> was of <b>five</b> handbreadths. <b>And this Ark is a vessel.</b> Therefore, <b>it</b> was constructed with a cubit of five handbreadths. <b>According to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, who said</b> that unit of measurement for <b>the Ark was a cubit of five handbreadths, it was constructed to a length of twelve and a half handbreadths, as it is written: “Two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof”</b> (Exodus 25:10). <b>A cubit is five</b> handbreadths, <b>and</b> another <b>cubit is five</b> handbreadths, <b>and a half-cubit is two and a half</b> handbreadths, which totals twelve and a half handbreadths. <b>And four tablets were</b> placed <b>in</b> the Ark, <b>two</b> tablets were <b>whole and two</b> tablets were <b>broken, as it is written:</b> “And I will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables <b>which you did break, and you shall put them in the Ark”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:2). <b>Each one of the tablets’ length was six handbreadths, and its width was six handbreadths.</b> If one <b>lays the length of the tablets across the length of the Ark, a half-handbreadth remains there.</b> This leaves <b>a fingerbreadth,</b> equal to a quarter of a handbreadth, <b>for the wall from here,</b> on one side, and <b>a fingerbreadth for the wall from there,</b> on the other side. According to this opinion, the Torah scroll was not placed in the Ark. <b>The width of the Ark was seven and a half handbreadths, as it is written: “And a cubit and a half the breadth thereof”</b> (Exodus 25:10). <b>A cubit is five</b> handbreadths, <b>and a half-cubit is two and a half</b> handbreadths, which totals seven and a half handbreadths. <b>And four tablets were</b> placed <b>in</b> the Ark, <b>two</b> tablets were <b>whole and two</b> tablets were <b>broken, as it is written:</b> “And I will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables <b>which you did break, and you shall put them in the Ark”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:2). <b>The length of each one of the tablets was six handbreadths, and their width was six handbreadths.</b> If one <b>lays the width of the tablets across the width of the Ark, one and a half handbreadths remains there: A fingerbreadth for the wall from here,</b> on one side, <b>and a fingerbreadth for the wall from there,</b> on the other side, as well as <b>a half-handbreadth from here,</b> on one side, <b>and a half-handbreadth from here,</b> on the other side, <b>for handling</b> the tablets.",
                "The Gemara continues its discussion of the Ark. <b>How did Bezalel construct the Ark? Rabbi Ḥanina said: He constructed it of three boxes,</b> each one larger than the previous one (see <i>Yoma</i> 72b). <b>Two</b> of them were made <b>of gold</b> and <b>one</b> was made <b>of wood. He placed</b> the smallest box, which was made <b>of gold, in</b> the box <b>of wood, and</b> he placed the box <b>of wood in</b> the box <b>of gold,</b> the largest box. <b>And</b> he then <b>overlaid</b> the lip of the box of wood with gold as well, <b>as it is written: “And you shall overlay it with pure gold, within and without</b> shall you overlay it” (Exodus 25:11). The verse already stated: “You shall overlay it.” <b>What</b> is the added meaning when <b>the verse states: “Shall you overlay it?”</b> The added words <b>convey</b> that <b>the upper lip</b> of the wooden box was also covered in gold. Alternatively, Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: <b>He constructed one box and overlaid it</b> on all sides with gold, <b>as it is written: “And you shall overlay it with pure gold, within and without</b> shall you overlay it” (Exodus 25:11). According to this explanation, <b>what</b> is the added meaning when <b>the verse states: “Shall you overlay it”? Rabbi Pineḥas said:</b> The added words <b>convey</b> that the area <b>between each board</b> needed to be covered in gold as well, to insure that no part of the Ark lacked a gold covering.",
                "The Gemara continues with discussion of the two tablets. <b>How were the tablets written? Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel says: Five on this tablet and five on that tablet. This is as it is written: “And He wrote them upon two tablets of stone”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:13), i.e., <b>five</b> of the Ten Commandments <b>on this tablet and five on that tablet. But the Rabbis say:</b> All of the <b>Ten</b> Commandments were written <b>on this tablet and</b> the same <b>ten were written on that tablet. This is as it is written: “And He declared unto you His covenant, which He commanded you to perform, even the ten words”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:13). This teaches that there were <b>ten on this tablet and ten on that tablet. Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: Twenty on this tablet and twenty on that tablet, as it is written: “And He wrote them upon two tablets of stone”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:13). This teaches that there <b>were twenty on this tablet and twenty on that tablet. Rabbi Simai said: Forty on this tablet and forty on that tablet, as it is written: “On the one side and on the other were they written”</b> (Exodus 32:15), as <b>a cube</b> [<b><i>tatroga</i></b>]. <b>Ḥananya, nephew of Rabbi Yehoshua, says: Between each and every statement</b> that was written on the tablets, <b>its precise</b> details <b>and</b> the explanation of <b>its letters</b> were written as well, <b>as it is written: “Filled with beryl [<i>tarshish</i>]”</b> (Song of Songs 5:14). <i>Tarshish</i> is the name of a sea, or more likely, an area of the Mediterranean. The verse is indicating that the Torah is filled with all of these details, <b>like the great sea</b> is filled with waves. <b>When Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish would reach this verse,</b> “Filled with beryl,” <b>he would say:</b> The parable that <b>Ḥananya, nephew of Rabbi Yehoshua, taught me is appropriate. Just as between</b> one <b>large wave and</b> another <b>large wave there are smaller waves</b> in <b>this sea, so too, the precise</b> details <b>and</b> the explanations of <b>the letters of the Torah</b> were written <b>between each and every commandment.</b>",
                "Due to the differing opinions with regard to the length of the cubit, there are differing opinions with regard to the size of the Ark. It follows that, according to the opinion of Rabbi Meir, the Torah scroll was placed in the Ark, while according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, it was not placed there. <b>Rabbi Tanḥuma said: I raised the</b> following <b>difficulty in the presence of Rabbi Pineḥas.</b> The next verse <b>conforms to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda and does not conform to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir. What is the source for</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda? As it is written: “Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:26). This verse indicates that the Torah scroll was placed next to the Ark and not inside it. This is <b>in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, who said: Where was the Torah scroll placed? A box-like</b> container [<b><i>gluskiyya</i></b>] <b>was made for it on the outside, and the Torah scroll was placed inside it.</b> <b>What is the source for</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir</b> that the Torah scroll was placed inside the Ark? It is <b>as it is written, “And you shall put the Ark cover upon the Ark from above; and in the Ark you shall put the testimony that I shall give you”</b> (Exodus 25:21). This verse indicates that first the Ark cover was placed on the Ark, and only subsequently was the testimony, i.e., the tablets, placed inside. Since a previous verse (Exodus 25:16) already commands to put the tablets in the Ark, this second instruction to place the testimony must be referring to the Torah scroll rather than the tablets. This reading is supported by the fact that the instruction to place the testimony follows the instruction to place the Ark cover. The Ark cover must have been put in place first, as the complete Torah scroll did not exist until the end of the fortieth year in the desert, long after the assembly of the Tabernacle and the Ark. <b>According to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, who stated</b> that <b>there is no absolute chronological order in the Torah,</b> the verse can be understand that testimony always refers to the tablets. <b>Therefore,</b> the verse may be understood that first it states: <b>“And in the Ark you shall put the testimony that I shall give you,” and</b> only <b>afterward</b> it states: <b>“And you shall put the Ark cover upon the Ark from above.”</b> Apropos the discussion of the tablets and the Torah, the Gemara cites a further statement on the subject. <b>Rabbi Pineḥas</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: The Torah that the Holy One,</b> Blessed be He, <b>gave to Moses</b> on Mount Sinai <b>was given to him</b> as <b>white fire engraved with black fire. It,</b> the Torah itself, <b>is fire mixed with fire, carved from</b> beneath the throne of glory, which is <b>fire, and given from</b> the One who is <b>fire, as it is written: “At His right hand was a fiery law unto them”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:2)."

                "<strong>Halakha 2 · MISHNA</strong> The previous mishna mentioned that there were thirteen prostrations in the Temple. <b>Where were these prostrations?</b> There were <b>four in the north</b> of the courtyard, <b>four in the south, three in the east and two in the west,</b> as the thirteen prostrations were <b>facing the thirteen gates</b> of the Temple courtyard. The thirteen gates were as follows: <b>The southern ones,</b> listed in order, beginning with the one <b>adjacent to the western</b> side, were <b>the Upper Gate,</b> and the topography of the courtyard was such that there was an incline on the east-west plane, therefore the gate farthest to the west was higher than the other gates; <b>the Gate of Kindling,</b> through which the priests would bring the wood for the arrangement of fire on top of the altar; <b>the Gate of the Firstborn,</b> through which priests would bring the ritually pure firstborn animals to be sacrificed, as it is permitted to slaughter firstborn animals on the southern side of the courtyard; and <b>the Gate of Water.</b> The mishna elaborates: <b>And why was it named the Gate of Water? Since through it they would bring in the vial</b> <sup><b>[17a]</b></sup> <b>of</b> water for <b>the water libation on the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, as they would ceremoniously draw the water from the Pool of Siloam and bring it to the altar through this gate. <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> There was a different reason for this name. It was called the Gate of Water because <b>through it the water would trickle [<i>mefakim</i>], and in the future</b> this water will increase and <b>go out from under the threshold of the House.</b> <b>Facing these</b> gates were the ones <b>in the north,</b> listed in order from the one <b>closest to the west: The Gate of Jeconiah; the Gate of the Offering,</b> through which they would bring the offerings of the most sacred order, as these could be slaughtered only in the northern part of the courtyard; <b>the Gate of Women,</b> where women would enter the courtyard to place their hands on the heads of their offerings; and <b>the Gate of Song,</b> through which they would bring the musical instruments into the courtyard. The mishna asks: <b>And why was it called the Gate of Jeconiah?</b> The reason is <b>that through it Jeconiah went out to his exile.</b> Before Jeconiah was exiled by Nebuchadnezzar to Babylon he came to take leave of the Temple, and he left through this gate. The mishna resumes the list with the gates <b>that</b> are <b>in the east: the Gate of Nicanor,</b> which was named after Nicanor, who brought the doors of this gate from Egypt (see <i>Yoma</i> 38a). <b>And</b> the Gate of Nicanor <b>had two wickets [<i>pishpeshin</i>], one on its right and one on its left. And</b> there were <b>two</b> gates <b>in the west that did not have a name,</b> making a total of thirteen gates.",
                "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna taught that there were thirteen gates in the courtyard. The Gemara notes that <b>the mishna is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Abba Yosei ben Yoḥanan, who said</b> in <i>Middot</i> 2:6 that the thirteen prostrations were performed <b>opposite</b> the <b>thirteen gates. However, according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> in <i>Middot</i> 1:4, <b>there were</b> only <b>seven gates in the courtyard.</b> Consequently, <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, where were these</b> thirteen <b>prostrations</b> performed, if there weren’t a corresponding number of gates? The Gemara answers that the prostrations correspond <b>to that which we learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (see <i>Middot</i> 2:3): <b>There were thirteen breaches</b> in the <i>soreg</i>, the lattice fence between the walls of the courtyard and the Temple Mount, <b>that the kings of Greece breached.</b> They did this to allow foreigners to enter the courtyard and to demonstrate that this area was not reserved exclusively for priests. <b>And the sons of the Hasmonean</b> dynasty <b>returned and fenced in</b> those breaches, <b>and decreed</b> that <b>thirteen prostrations</b> should be performed <b>opposite them.</b> Anyone who encircled the courtyard and passed by one of the places where a breach had been sealed would prostrate in gratitude to God for removing Greek control and the decrees against the Jews of Eretz Yisrael.",
                "The Gemara expands upon the idea expressed by Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov that in the future the water from the Gate of Water will increase and emerge from under the threshold of the House: It is written in a prophecy concerning the end of days: <b>“And it shall come to pass in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem:</b> Half of them toward the eastern sea, and half of them toward the western sea; in summer and in winter shall it be” (Zechariah 14:8), and <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From the house of the Holy of Holies to the curtain,</b> the stream of water will be as thin <b>as the antennae of <i>silai</i> and <i>khilai</i>,</b> two types of snails. <b>From the veil to the golden altar</b> the stream of water will increase slightly until it is <b>like the antennae of grasshoppers. From</b> the place of <b>the golden altar to the courtyards</b> it will further increase to the thickness <b>of a thread of the warp</b> of a loom. <b>From the courtyards to the threshold of the House</b> the stream will widen to the size <b>of a thread of the woof,</b> which was thicker than the thread of the warp. <b>From here onward</b> the stream will reach the width of <b>a stream of liquid poured from the mouth of a cruse.</b> The Gemara cites another <i>baraita</i> on this topic. <b>It is written: “And, behold, there trickled forth waters on the right side. When the man went forth eastward with the line in his hand, he measured a thousand cubits, and he caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the ankles”</b> (Ezekiel 47:2–3). This verse teaches that at a distance of a thousand cubits the height of the water was <b>up to the ankles.</b> The next verse states: <b>“Again he measured a thousand, and caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the knees,”</b> which indicates that after an additional thousand cubits the water was <b>up to the knees.</b> The verse continues: <b>“Again he measured a thousand, and caused me to pass through waters that were to the loins”</b> (Ezekiel 47:4), which teaches that after the next thousand cubits the height of the water rose <b>until the loins. From here onward</b> the water continued to rise, until <b>“he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could not pass through”</b> (Ezekiel 47:5). After the last thousand cubits the water was so high that <b>even a large Liburnian ship,</b> a type of a warship, <b>could not pass through</b> the current. <b>What is the explanation</b> of the verse: <b>“Neither shall gallant ship pass thereby”</b> (Isaiah 33:21). <b>Why? “For the waters were risen, waters to swim in [<i>mei saḥu</i>],</b> a river that could not be passed through” (Ezekiel 47:5). <b>What is</b> the meaning of the phrase <b><i>mei saḥu</i>?</b> It means that the water flowed so fast and high it prevented one <b>from swimming.</b> Similarly, <b>Rav Ḥuna said</b> to clarify the meaning of the word “<i>saḥu</i>”: <b>In our locale they call swimming <i>saḥona</i>,</b> as in the verse: <b>“And when he shall spread forth his hands in its midst, as he who swims spreads forth his hands to swim [<i>hasoḥeh lisḥot</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 25:11). The Gemara presents an alternate explanation for this verse. <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>“waters to swim in [saḥu]”? Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Bun, said: Water that is discussed in the world.</b> The term <i>saḥu</i> is associated with <i>siḥa</i>, which means discussion or conversation. The verse indicates that this river will be the topic of every discussion, due to its high waters and strong current. The Gemara continues to discuss this river. It is written: <b>“In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for purification and for sprinkling”</b> (Zechariah 13:1). This river will be used for the purification of the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. The Gemara asks: Since this river can serve to purify any member of the Jewish people, why did the verse single out the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem? The Gemara answers: The verse is not listing those who are fit to be purified by this river. Rather, it is delineating the various parts of this river that serve different functions. As <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman</b> explained <b>in the name of Rabbi Yonatan: From</b> the dwelling place of <b>the house of David until</b> the residences of <b>the inhabitants of Jerusalem,</b> the water in this river is considered running spring water, which <b>is fit for</b> the purpose of purifying <b>a menstruating woman,</b> as well as for use in the waters of <b>purification,</b> i.e., spring water that was mixed with the ashes of the Red Heifer. <b>From here onward it is</b> considered <b>combined water,</b> a mixture of spring and rain water, which is <b>fit for</b> the purification of <b>a menstruating woman but unfit for the waters of purification.</b> The Gemara presents an alternate explanation of the verse. <b>Rabbi Elazar said: From</b> the palace of <b>the house of David until</b> the residences of <b>the inhabitants of Jerusalem,</b> the water is <b>fit for</b> the purification of <b>a menstruating woman</b> as well as for the waters of <b>purification. From here onward, it is</b> considered <b>water</b> running down <b>slopes [<i>ketafrisot</i>],</b> and <b>is unfit</b> both <b>for</b> the purification of <b>a menstruating woman and for</b> the waters of <b>purification.</b>",
                "In Ezekiel’s prophecy concerning this river, <b>it is</b> further <b>written: “Then he said to me: These waters issue forth toward the eastern region,</b> and shall go down into the Arabah; and when they shall enter into the sea, into the sea of the putrid waters, the waters shall be healed” (Ezekiel 47:8). <b>This</b> eastern region mentioned in this verse <b>is</b> the <b>Sea of Samkhu,</b> which is the modern Hula Lake in the northern Galilee. <b>“And shall go down into the Arabah,” this</b> phrase refers to <b>the Sea of Tiberias,</b> i.e., the Sea of Galilee. <b>“And when they shall enter into the sea,” this is the Dead Sea. “Into the sea of the putrid waters [<i>mutza’im</i>],” this is the Great Sea,</b> the Mediterranean Sea. <b>And why was it called <i>mutza’im</i>,</b> which literally means taken out? This <b>corresponds to the two occasions that</b> the sea <b>went out</b> and overran the dry land, <b>once in the Generation of Enosh,</b> when idolatry proliferated, <b>and once in the Generation of the Dispersion,</b> i.e., that of the Tower of Babel. Until where did the sea overrun the dry land? <b>Rabbi Elazar</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina: In the first instance,</b> the Generation of Enosh, it <b>went out until Calabria,</b> in southern Italy, <b>and in the second instance,</b> the Generation of Dispersion, it <b>went out until the rocks of Barbary</b> in North Africa. <b>Rabbi Aḥa</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina: In the first instance</b> the sea <b>went out until the rocks of Barbary, and in the second instance</b> it <b>went out until Akko and until Jaffa.</b> The Gemara adds that there is support for this claim from the verse: <b>“Thus far [<i>ad po</i>] you shall come, but no further,</b> and here your proud waves shall be stayed” (Job 38:11). The phrase <i>ad po</i> is similar in meaning to <i>ad ko</i>, which alludes to the city of Akko. The verse is saying that <b>until Akko you shall come, but no further.</b> Likewise, in the last part of the verse: <b>“And here [<i>ufo</i>] your proud waves shall be stayed,”</b> the similarity between the words <i>ufo</i> and <i>Yafo</i>, Jaffa, hints that <b>until Jaffa your proud waves shall be stayed.</b> The Gemara stated above that the waters of the river that emerge from the Temple Mount will reach four seas: The Sea of Samkhu, the Sea of Tiberias, the Dead Sea, and the Mediterranean Sea. The Gemara asks: <b>It works out well</b> that the river will reach the <b>Great Sea,</b> i.e., the Mediterranean Sea, and the <b>Dead Sea, in order to sweeten them,</b> and render them drinkable, as they contain saltwater. However, with regard to <b>the Sea of Tiberias, and the Sea of Samkhu,</b> whose water is already sweet, for what purpose will this river reach them? The Gemara responds that when the water of this river reaches these seas, their waters will be blessed <b>by an increase</b> in the number of <b>their fish, as it is written with regard to</b> this river: <b>“Their fish shall be after their kinds”</b> (Ezekiel 47:10). This verse teaches that <b>their fish will be of multiple kinds,</b> great in number and variety. <b>It was</b> likewise <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said:</b> There was <b>an incident in which I went to Sidon,</b> north of the Sea of Galilee, <b>and they brought before me more than three hundred kinds of fish in one pot.</b>",
                " The Gemara continues to interpret the verses in Ezekiel: <b>“And the waters shall be healed…But its miry places and its marshes shall not be healed; they shall be given for salt”</b> (Ezekiel 47:8–11). The Gemara points out an apparent contradiction: It is written: <b>“And the waters shall be healed,” and</b> yet <b>you say that the waters shall not be healed?</b> The Gemara responds that <b>it is a place called Velo Yerafu,</b> which means: They will not be healed. This verse is detailing the locations where the waters will heal, namely the miry places, the marshes, and a place called Velo Yerafu.",
                "<b>It is</b> further <b>written</b> there: <b>“And by the river upon its bank, on this side and on that side, shall grow every tree for food, whose leaf shall not wither, neither shall its fruit fail; it shall bring forth new fruit every month,</b> because its waters issue out of the Temple; and its fruit shall be for food, and its leaf for healing” (Ezekiel 47:12). What is the meaning of the phrase “it shall bring forth new fruit every month”? <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> The meaning of the verse is <b>that in this world, grain produces</b> a crop <b>six months</b> after it is planted, <b>and a tree produces fruit twelve months</b> after its fruit is harvested. <b>However, in the future, grain will produce</b> crops <b>in one month, and a tree will produce</b> fruit <b>in two months.</b> <b>What is the explanation</b> of the words in the verse: <b>“It shall bring forth new fruit every month [<i>ḥodashav</i>]?”</b> The term <i>ḥodashav</i>, which incorporates the plural of the word month, indicates that the fruit will grow in two months. As the time required for grain to ripen is half the time of that of fruit, grain will ripen in a single month. This Gemara presents a dissenting opinion. <b>Rabbi Yosei said:</b> The meaning of the verse is <b>that in this world grain produces a</b> crop <b>six months</b> after it is planted, <b>while a tree produces fruit twelve months</b> after its fruit is harvested. <b>However, in the future, grain will produce</b> crops <b>in fifteen days, and a tree will produce</b> fruit <b>in one month, as we found that grain produced</b> a crop <b>in the days of Joel</b> that ripened <b>in fifteen days, and the <i>omer</i></b> offering <b>was brought from</b> that grain on the sixteenth of Nisan. In that year they brought the <i>omer</i> offering from grain fifteen days after it was sown. <b>What is the explanation</b> of the verse: <b>“Be glad then, you children of Zion, and rejoice in the Lord your God; for He gives you the first rain in just measure, and He causes the rain to come down for you, the first rain and the latter rain, at the first”</b> (Joel 2:23)? The Sages explain that there was a severe drought that year, and the first rains fell only on the first of Nisan (see <i>Ta’anit</i> 5a). The prophet commanded the people to plant their fields, and they found sufficient seeds to sow the fields. The second rains fell on the fifth of Nisan, and miraculously the grain ripened so quickly that they were able to bring the <i>omer</i> offering from that grain on the sixteenth of the month. In the future the grain will ripen as quickly as it did then. The Gemara asks: <b>And how</b> does <b>Rabbi Yosei establish</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“It shall bring forth new fruit every month,”</b> which apparently indicates that fruit will grow in two months? He explains that the verse means <b>that each and every month the tree will bring forth fruit.</b> The aforementioned verse states: <b>“And its leaf for healing [<i>terufa</i>]”</b> (Ezekiel 47:12). The Sages dispute the meaning of this phrase. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The word <i>terufa</i> with a <i>tav</i> is similar to <i>terufa</i> with a <i>tet</i>, which means food. Therefore the verse means: For <b>its food he sucks the leaves</b> of the tree that grows on the banks of that river, <b>and ingests their sustenance,</b> as the leaves of this tree nourish as much as its fruit. <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> both interpreted <i>terufa</i> as an allusion to <i>lehatir pe</i>, to release the mouth, but differed over the exact meaning. <b>One said</b> it means <b>to release the upper mouth,</b> i.e., to open the mouth of a mute person, such that he will be able to speak if he eats from the fruit of this tree. And the other <b>one said</b> it means <b>to release the lower mouth,</b> a reference to the womb; a barren woman who eats from this tree will be able to conceive. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> disagree in a similar manner. <b>One said</b> the verse means <b>to release the mouth of infertility, and</b> the other <b>one said</b> it means <b>to open the mouth of the mute.</b>",
                "In its list of the gates in the Temple, the mishna stated: <b>Facing</b> the gates in the south were additional gates <b>in the north, etc.</b> One of the gates in the north was the Gate of Jeconiah, through which this king departed for exile. The Gemara relates that <b>you find at the time that Nebuchadnezzar ascended to</b> Eretz Yisrael to remove Jeconiah, Jehoiachin, from his throne, three months after he had crowned him instead of his father Jehoiakim. <b>He came and settled in Dofnei of Antioch,</b> where he set up his camp. <b>And the Great Sanhedrin came out to greet him and said to him: Has the time come for this House to be destroyed?</b> Is that the purpose for which you have arrived? <b>He said to them: The king that I crowned</b> to rule <b>over you, give him to me</b> as a captive <b>and I will go.</b> <b>They came and said to Jehoiachin, king of Judea: Nebuchadnezzar requires</b> that <b>you</b> be taken into captivity to Babylon. <b>When he heard this from them, he took the keys of the Temple</b> and <b>ascended to the roof of the Sanctuary and said before Him: Master of the Universe, in the past we were faithful to You and Your keys were handed over to us. Now that we are not faithful, Your keys are handed over to You. Two <i>amora’im</i></b> dispute what happened next: <b>One said</b> that Jehoiachin took the keys and <b>threw them</b> up to the heavens <b>and they have not yet descended</b> from there. <b>And one said</b> that <b>the likeness of a hand came and took them from his hand. When all</b> <sup><b>[17b]</b></sup> the <b>nobles of [<i>ḥorei</i>] Judea saw</b> what had occurred, <b>they went up to the top of their roofs and fell and died. This is as it is written: “The burden concerning the Valley of Vision. What ails you now, that you have wholly gone up to the housetops, you that are full of uproar, a tumultuous city,</b> a joyous town? Your slain are not slain with the sword, nor dead in battle” (Isaiah 22:1–2). Isaiah prophesies about Jerusalem, the Valley of Vision, which will be conquered by Nebuchadnezzar, crying: What ails you, Jerusalem, that your nobles will go up to the rooftops and fall to their deaths? Your dead will not be slain with the sword or in battle; they will die by falling from the rooftops."

Eight</b> of them were made <b>of marble</b> and were located <b>in the slaughtering area,</b> north of the altar, where the priests would slaughter the offerings of the most sacred order. <b>Upon these</b> tables <b>they would wash the innards</b> of the offerings, as the marble was cool and preserved the freshness of the meat. <b>And</b> there were <b>two</b> more tables <b>on the western</b> side <b>of the ramp,</b> south of the altar, <b>one of marble and one of silver.On</b> the table <b>of marble they would place the limbs</b> before they were sacrificed, and from there the priests would bring them up to the altar. <b>On</b> the table made <b>of silver</b> they would place the ninety-three <b>sacred vessels</b> brought out from the Chamber of Vessels each morning for the services of that day. <b>And</b> there were <b>two</b> tables <b>in the Entrance Hall</b> to the Sanctuary, <b>on the inside</b> of the Entrance Hall, <b>near the opening to the Temple, one of marble and one of gold. On</b> the table <b>of marble they would put the shewbread before its entrance</b> to the Sanctuary after it was baked on the eve of Shabbat. <b>And</b> they would place the old shewbread <b>on</b> the table <b>of gold upon its exit</b> from the Sanctuary, to be divided among the priests. The reason the shewbread was placed on a marble table before being brought into the Sanctuary and on a golden one upon when removed from there is <b>that one elevates</b> to a higher level <b>in</b> matters of <b>sanctity and one does not downgrade.</b> Since it had been placed on the golden Shewbread table all week inside the Sanctuary, upon its removal it could not be derogated to a marble table and so was placed on a different golden table in the Entrance Hall. Finally, there was <b>one</b> table <b>of gold inside</b> the Sanctuary, i.e. the Shewbread table, <b>upon which the shewbread</b> was placed <b>always.</b>",
                "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna stated that the shewbread was placed on a marble table when it was brought into the Sanctuary. The Gemara cites a different opinion: As it <b>was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When the shewbread was brought into the sanctuary it was placed <b>on</b> a table <b>of silver.</b> In accordance with the opinion stated in the mishna, that the bread was placed on a marble table, <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak,</b> who said that <b>Rabbi Ḥananya cites this</b> tradition <b>in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: There was no</b> table <b>of silver here, as it boils,</b> i.e., it heats articles placed upon it, which could cause the shewbread to grow moldy. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>as follows: This was one of the miracles that were performed in the Temple, that just as they would place</b> the shewbread <b>hot</b> as it came out of the oven, <b>so too they would remove it hot, as it is stated: “To put hot bread in the day when it was taken away”</b> (I Samuel 21:7). When they removed the shewbread after seven days on the golden table, it was as hot as it was when they originally placed it there. Why, then, were they concerned about placing the shewbread on a silver table, if it would remain warm in any event? The Gemara answers that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: One does not mention miraculous events.</b> Despite the fact that miracles occur, one should not rely on them, but rather act according to the laws of nature. Therefore the priests did not place the bread on a silver table that could have spoiled the shewbread through natural causes. <b>They raised a dilemma before Rabbi Ila:</b> If one week <b>there was no</b> new <b>bread</b> to replace the old bread on the shewbread table, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>leaving</b> the old shewbread <b>until the next Shabbat?</b> On the one hand, as the time has arrived for the bread to be removed and divided among the priests, if it remains after this time it could be considered <i>notar</i>, left over, and disqualified by remaining overnight. On the other hand, as there is no new bread to replace it, perhaps this bread would still be considered the shewbread of the table and would not be disqualified until new bread would be brought. Rabbi Ila <b>said to them</b> that <b>it is written: “And you shall set upon the table shewbread before Me always”</b> (Exodus 25:30). There should always be <b>shewbread</b> on the table, <b>even if it is disqualified.</b>",
                "The Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> that discusses the shewbread table: <b>Solomon built ten tables</b> for the Temple, modeled after the shewbread table. <b>As it is written: “He made also ten tables, and placed them in the Temple, five on the right side and five on the left”</b> (II Chronicles 4:8). The Gemara asks: <b>If you say</b> that right and left refer to the sides of the entrance to the Sanctuary, which means that Solomon set up <b>five</b> tables <b>in the southern</b> side of the Sanctuary to the left of its entrance, <b>and five in the northern</b> side of the Sanctuary to the right, this is difficult. The Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>Isn’t the table fit only</b> if it is <b>in the northern</b> part of the Sanctuary, <b>as it is stated: “And you shall put the table on the north side”</b> (Exodus 26:35)? If so, <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Five on the right side and five on the left”? Rather,</b> it must mean that the table prepared by Moses was positioned in the proper place in the Sanctuary, and <b>five</b> of the tables made by Solomon were placed <b>to the right of the table of Moses, and five to its left.</b> <b>Even so,</b> despite the fact that there were so many tables in the Sanctuary, the priest <b>would arrange</b> the shewbread <b>only on the table of Moses alone, as it is stated:</b> “And Solomon made all the vessels that were in the House of the Lord, the golden altar, <b>and the table whereupon the shewbread was,</b> of gold” (I Kings 7:48). The use of the definite article “the” to describe the table indicates that there was one unique table upon which the shewbread was arranged, the table of Moses. Conversely, <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says: He would arrange</b> the shewbread <b>on all of</b> the tables, each one in turn, <b>as it is stated: “And the tables upon which was the shewbread”</b> (II Chronicles 4:19). This verse indicates that the shewbread was placed on all the tables. The Gemara continues to discuss the shewbread table. <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: All the tables, both of Moses and Solomon, <b>were positioned</b> from <b>east to west,</b> in the northern part of the Sanctuary, so that their length ran parallel to the length of the Sanctuary. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: They were placed</b> from <b>north to south,</b> and their length was to the width of the Sanctuary. According to <b>the one who said</b> that the tables were placed from <b>east to west it works out well, as they are all suitable for service.</b> The tables were positioned in a manner that rendered them all fit for service, as the table could be used only in the northern part of the Sanctuary, in accordance with the verse: “And you shall put the table on the north side” (Exodus 26:35). However, according to <b>the one who said</b> that they were placed from <b>north to south, the table,</b> i.e., five of the tables, are <b>found in the southern</b> part of the Sanctuary, <sup><b>[18a]</b></sup> <b>and the candelabrum in the north</b> of the Sanctuary. <b>But wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The</b> shewbread <b>table was situated from</b> the <b>halfway</b> point <b>of the House and inward,</b> in the inner half of the Sanctuary, <b>drawn two and a half cubits</b> away <b>from the wall to the north.</b> The priests who arranged the shewbread on the table would stand in this space. <b>And the candelabrum</b> was situated <b>opposite it, in the south</b> of the Sanctuary, likewise two and a half cubits from the wall. <b>The golden altar was situated in the middle of the House, dividing the House</b> from its <b>halfway</b> point <b>and inward,</b> i.e., equidistant from the north and south walls, <b>slightly drawn</b> back from the place of the table and the candelabrum <b>toward the outside.</b> Since the length of the entire area was sixty cubits, twenty for the Holy of Holies, and forty for the Sanctuary, <b>all</b> the vessels <b>were situated from a third of the</b> entire <b>House and inward,</b> i.e., the vessels were all contained in the second third of the entire area.",
                "King <b>Solomon constructed ten candelabra,</b> modeled after the one that Moses crafted, <b>as it is stated: “And he made the ten candlesticks of gold according to the ordinance concerning them; and he set them in the Sanctuary, five on the right, and five on the left”</b> (II Chronicles 4:7). Before completing its citation of the <i>baraita</i>, the Gemara asks: <b>If you say</b> that right and left refer to the sides of the entrance to the Sanctuary, which would mean that Solomon set up <b>five</b> candelabra <b>in the north</b> of the Sanctuary, to the left of its entrance, <b>and five in the south</b> of the Sanctuary, to the right of its entrance, this is difficult. The Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>Isn’t the candelabrum fit only</b> if it is <b>in the south of the Sanctuary, as it is stated: “And the candelabrum over against the table on the side of the Tabernacle toward the south”</b> (Exodus 26:35). <b>What,</b> then, is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Five on the right, and five on the left”? Rather,</b> it must mean that the candelabrum that Moses made was located in the Sanctuary, while <b>five</b> of the candelabra that Solomon crafted were placed <b>to the right of the candelabrum of Moses, and five to its left.</b> <b>Even so,</b> i.e., despite the fact that there were so many candelabra in the Sanctuary, the priest <b>would kindle only</b> the candelabrum <b>of Moses alone, as it is stated: “And the candelabrum of gold with its lamps, to burn every evening”</b> (II Chronicles 13:11). The singular form indicates that only one candelabrum was lit. Conversely, <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says: He would kindle all</b> eleven candelabra, one of Moses and ten of Solomon, each one in turn, <b>as it is stated: “And the candelabra with their lamps, that they should burn according to the ordinance before the Sanctuary, of pure gold”</b> (II Chronicles 4:20). The plural “candelabra” indicates that they were all lit. The <i>baraita</i> analyzes the subsequent verse: <b>“And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold, and that perfect gold [<i>mikhelot zahav</i>]”</b> (II Chronicles 4:21). This means that the candelabrum completely <b>depleted [<i>killu</i>] the gold of Solomon.</b> As the gold was repeatedly purified until it reached the required level of purity, a large quantity of gold evaporated. The Gemara cites a related <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rav Yehuda taught in the name of</b> the Sage <b>Asi: Solomon would take a thousand talents of gold and insert them into the crucible and remove them.</b> He repeated this process <b>until</b> the gold was so refined that <b>he established</b> its weight <b>as one</b> talent of gold, <b>to fulfill that which is stated</b> about the original candelabrum in the Tabernacle: <b>“Of a talent of pure gold made he it, etc.”</b> (Exodus 37:24). <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, said:</b> There was <b>an incident involving the candelabrum of gold that Moses made in the desert, which exceeded</b> the weight set by the Torah, one talent, <b>by one dinar of gold. And they inserted it into the crucible eighty times,</b> to further refine it and reduce its weight, <b>but it was not reduced</b> by <b>anything.</b> <b>And this is proper,</b> for <b>as long as it had not achieved its correct</b> state of purity, <b>it would decrease greatly,</b> as its refinement in the crucible removed all the impurities, thereby reducing its weight. However, <b>from when it had achieved its correct</b> state of purity, <b>it was not reduced at all.</b> Unlike the gold of Moses, the gold Solomon used was not originally free of impurity and therefore required refinement."

                "<strong>Halakha 4 · MISHNA</strong> <b>There were thirteen</b> collection <b>horns in the Temple, and</b> the intended use of the funds <b>was written upon</b> each one, as follows: <b>New shekels, old shekels, pairs</b> of birds, <b>fledglings</b> designated for <b>burnt-offerings, wood</b> for the arrangement on the altar, <b>frankincense</b> that accompanied meal-offerings, and <b>gold</b> donated <b>for the Ark cover.</b> The remaining <b>six horns</b> were designated <b>for</b> communal <b>free-will offerings.</b> The horn labeled <b>new shekels</b> was designated for the half-shekel donation <b>that</b> was brought <b>every year</b> for the needs of that year. The horn labeled <b>old shekels</b> was for <b>one who did not bring</b> his half-shekel <b>the previous year,</b> who would <b>contribute his shekel for the following year.</b> The funds in the horn labeled <b>pairs</b> of birds <b>are</b> designated for the <b>turtledoves</b> used for bird-offerings, and the one labeled <b>fledglings</b> for <b>burnt-offerings are</b> used to purchase <b>young pigeons</b> as burnt-offerings. <b>All of these,</b> i.e., the funds in both horns, were used exclusively for voluntary <b>burnt-offerings.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The funds in both the horn labeled pairs of birds and the horn labeled fledglings were for young pigeons and turtledoves. The distinction between them is that the funds in the horn labeled <b>pairs</b> of birds were designated for the obligatory offerings of a <i>zav</i>, a <i>zava</i>, a woman after childbirth, and a leper. These offerings included a pair of birds, <b>one</b> brought for <b>a sin-offering, and</b> the other <b>one</b> brought for <b>a burnt-offering.</b> Conversely, the funds in the horn labeled <b>fledglings</b> for <b>burnt-offerings</b> were <b>all</b> used exclusively for voluntary <b>burnt-offerings.</b> <b>One who says:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>wood</b> to the Temple, must donate <b>no fewer than two logs</b> for the arrangement on the altar. One who says: It is incumbent upon me to donate <b>frankincense,</b> must donate <b>no less than a handful</b> of frankincense, the amount brought with a meal-offering. One who says: It is incumbent upon me to donate <b>gold,</b> must donate <b>no less than a dinar of gold.</b> It was stated that <b>six horns</b> were designated <b>for</b> communal <b>free-will offerings.</b> The Mishna asks: With regard to the money designated for communal <b>free-will offerings, what would they do with this</b> money? The Mishna answers that they used <b>it to purchase</b> animals for <b>burnt-offerings,</b> as <b>the meat</b> from these offerings was offered on the altar <b>to God and the hides</b> were given <b>to the priests.</b> <b>This midrash was taught</b> by <b>Jehoiada the High Priest:</b> There is an apparent contradiction between two verses. With regard to the guilt-offering, the verse states: <b>“It is a guilt-offering; he is certainly guilty before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 5:19). This verse indicates that the guilt-offering goes to God, not the priests. However, a different verse states: “As is the sin-offering, so is the guilt-offering; there is one law for them; the priest who makes atonement with it, he shall have it” (Leviticus 7:7). This verse indicates that the offering is designated for the priests alone. How can these two verses be reconciled? The Mishna explains that <b>this is the principle: Any</b> funds <b>that come due to a sin-offering or due to a guilt-offering,</b> i.e., leftover coins designated for one of these offerings, <b>they</b> should be used for the <b>purchase of animals for a</b> voluntary <b>burnt-offering,</b> as <b>the meat</b> will be offered on the altar <b>to God, and the hides</b> will go <b>to the priests.</b> In this manner <b>the two verses are found</b> to be <b>fulfilled,</b> as it is both <b>a guilt-offering to God as well as a guilt-offering to the priest.</b> <b>And</b> this <i>halakha</i> also explains the verse that <b>says: “The guilt-offering money and the sin-offering money was not brought into the House of the Lord; it was for the priests”</b> (II Kings 12:17). This verse is understood to refer to the hides given to the priests.",
                "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: There was no</b> collection <b>horn for pairs</b> of birds in the Temple in <b>Jerusalem, due to the mixtures.</b> The concern was that <b>perhaps</b> one of the women obligated to bring a pair of birds <b>would die</b> after putting her money in the horn. <b>And</b> if that happens, it would <b>turn out</b> that <b>the funds for sin-offerings left to die are mixed with</b> the rest of the money in the horn. When the owner of funds designated for a sin-offering passes away, the designated money must be destroyed. Since there is no way to distinguish between the coins, all the money is prohibited. The Gemara raises a difficulty against this conclusion. <b>But wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that with regard to <b>a woman who said:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a pair</b> of birds, that <b>she brings the funds for</b> the purchase of <b>a pair</b> of birds to the Temple <b>and places them in the</b> collection <b>horn.</b> <sup><b>[18b]</b></sup> <b>And</b> after she has ritually immersed for her purification and the sun has set, <b>she</b> may <b>eat consecrated</b> foods. <b>And she need not be concerned that perhaps</b> the priest <b>was lazy</b> and neglected to sacrifice her offering, which would cause her to lack atonement and be prohibited from eating sacrificial food. <b>And the priest need not be concerned that perhaps</b> one of the women who placed funds in this horn has died, which would mean that <b>the funds for sin-offerings left to die are mixed with</b> the rest of the coins. Since this ruling is undisputed, it is evidently accepted by all the Sages, including Rabbi Yehuda. If so, how can it be claimed that Rabbi Yehuda said there were no horns for obligatory pairs of birds due to the concern that one of the women who placed money there had died? The Gemara answers: <b>When we say</b> this opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, we are referring to a case where it is known that one of the women had died, which means that the funds she gave have the status <b>of a sin-offering whose owner had certainly died.</b> In this case the coins definitely cannot be used for an offering, and they invalidate the other coins with which they are mingled in the horn. To avoid this scenario, Rabbi Yehuda maintains that there was no horn for obligatory pairs of birds. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> even <b>if we say</b> that there is a concern that the horn contains invalidated coins, the following remedy can be applied: <b>Let us select four <i>zuz</i>,</b> the value of one pair of birds (see <i>Keritot</i> 1:7), and declare that these are the invalidated coins, <b>and throw them into the river</b> so that they will be destroyed, <b>and the remainder will be permitted.</b> If so, even according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, there should be no problem with a horn for pairs of birds. The Gemara answers: This is not an effective solution according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, because <b>we generally say: Rabbi Yehuda does not accept</b> the principle of <b>retroactive designation.</b> According to Rabbi Yehuda, a doubtful state of affairs cannot be clarified retroactively. Consequently, one cannot resolve this problem by setting aside four <i>zuz</i>, and he maintains that there was no horn for obligatory pairs of birds.",
                "§ It was taught in the mishna that if one said: It is incumbent upon me to donate wood, he must donate no fewer than two logs. The Gemara addresses a similar case: <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Bun, said that Rabbi Ba bar Memel raised a dilemma:</b> What is the ruling if <b>one said:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate a log of <b>wood?</b> Does <b>he bring</b> only <b>one log?</b> <b>Rabbi Elazar said: The Mishna says so;</b> i.e., a mishna provides a solution to our dilemma. We learned that the two logs added each day to the arrangement on the altar, before the daily morning offering and before the daily afternoon offering, were not considered one offering, <b>as this</b> log <b>was an offering to itself and that</b> log <b>was an offering to itself.</b> Since each log was a separate offering, evidently one may donate even a single log. Where was this ruling taught? <b>As we learned in a mishna there,</b> with regard to the order of the daily afternoon offering: <b>Two</b> priests ascended to the altar, and <b>in their hands</b> were <b>two logs of wood</b> for the arrangement, each holding one log in his hand. This statement indicates that each log was a separate offering, as each was held by a different priest. The Gemara asks: From where is it derived that even an individual can pledge wood for the arrangement? From the verse: “And when any one brings a meal-offering to the Lord” (Leviticus 2:1). The word <b>offering</b> comes <b>to include the wood,</b> which is also referred to as an offering in the verse: “And we cast lots, the priests, the Levites, and the people, for the wood-offering” (Nehemiah 10:35). Furthermore, the phrase “any one” teaches that even an individual can pledge wood.",
                "As the Gemara is discussing the donation of logs for the arrangement, it mentions their measurements. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: The thickness</b> of this wood <b>was a cubit of the expanded cubits, and their length</b> was measured <b>by the shortened cubits. Rabbi Ḥoni</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Ammi:</b> The measurement of their thickness was <b>as on a scale [<i>turtanei</i>],</b> i.e., it was exactly one cubit. <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak</b> explained why a shortened cubit was used for the measurement of the wood and <b>said: As the area of the arrangement</b> on the bronze altar built by Moses <b>was only one cubit by one cubit, therefore,</b> the length of the log <b>was only a shortened cubit,</b> as it would otherwise protrude from the arrangement. <b>And it was likewise taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The breadth of <b>the base</b> of the altar made by Moses was <b>a cubit, the surrounding ledge</b> was <b>a cubit, the rim a cubit, the corners a cubit,</b> and the breadth of the place of the <b>arrangement</b> was likewise <b>a cubit.</b>",
                "§ It was taught in the mishna that if one pledges <b>frankincense</b> without specifying an amount, he must donate <b>no less than a handful.</b> The Gemara cites the verbal analogy that is the source for this <i>halakha</i>. <b>It is stated here:</b> “And you shall put pure frankincense with each row, that it may be to the bread for a <b>memorial-part”</b> (Leviticus 24:7). <b>And it is stated there,</b> with regard to the meal-offering of a sinner: “And the priest shall take his handful of it as its <b>memorial-part”</b> (Leviticus 5:12). The Gemara interprets the verbal analogy: <b>Just as</b> the term <b>“memorial-part” that is stated below</b> must be <b>a handful, so too,</b> the term <b>“memorial-part” that is stated here,</b> with regard to the frankincense brought with the shewbread, must be <b>a handful.</b> This shows that when an unspecified amount of frankincense is pledged as an independent free-will offering, the obligation is to bring a handful. The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> so, one can derive the opposite conclusion from the same verbal analogy: <b>Just as</b> the <b>memorial-part that is stated below,</b> by the shewbread, must be <b>two handfuls,</b> one for each arrangement of bread, <b>so too</b> the term <b>memorial-part stated here,</b> with regard to the free-will offering of frankincense, should be a measure of <b>two handfuls.</b> <b>Rabbi Ila said</b> in response: <b>Didn’t we</b> derive the measurement of a handful of frankincense <b>only from the meal-offering of a sinner? Just as there,</b> in the case of the meal-offering of a sinner, <b>an incomplete handful is invalid, so too, here,</b> with regard to frankincense of the shewbread, <b>an incomplete handful</b> should be <b>invalid.</b> It is possible to invalidate the frankincense of the shewbread only if each handful is considered an independent mitzva. If the two handfuls together were considered one mitzva, they would remain valid even if one of them were incomplete, as they contain a total amount greater than a handful. This proves that each handful is an independent mitzva, which means that if one of them is incomplete, the second does not complete it and it is invalidated. From here it can be inferred that every measurement of the frankincense, including a free-will offering of frankincense, requires a handful. <b>Rabbi Yosei said:</b> From the <b>statement of Rabbi Ila,</b> that the measurement of a handful of frankincense for a free-will offering is derived from the handful that came with the shewbread, which is measured according to the handful of the largest of the priests, it can be <b>said</b> that <b>one who donates incense brings it</b> according to the measure <b>of the handful of a priest</b> who has the <b>largest</b> hands, not the handful of the one who brings it. <b>Rabbi Ḥizkiya</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Yirmeya:</b> One who donates incense can approximate the handful of any priest, <b>and even</b> use <b>the handful of the owners.</b>",
                " The mishna taught that one who pledges <b>gold</b> without specifying the amount must donate <b>no less</b> than a dinar of gold. <b>Rabbi Elazar said: And this is</b> the case <b>if he mentioned a form</b> by saying: It is incumbent upon me to bring a gold coin. <b>However, if he did not mention a form,</b> but merely said: It is incumbent upon me to bring gold, <b>he</b> may <b>bring even a</b> small <b>hook</b> of any size.",
                "The mishna states that there were <b>six</b> collection horns <b>for</b> communal <b>free-will offerings,</b> in which the remainder of the funds for sin-offerings and burnt-offerings were placed, for the purchase of free-will offerings. <b>Ḥizkiya said:</b> There six horns <b>correspond to the six</b> extended <b>patrilineal families</b> of priests who served each week in the Temple. There was one collection horn for each family, to prevent quarrels among the priests. <b>Bar Pedaya said:</b> The six horns <b>correspond to</b> the <b>six</b> types of <b>animals</b> from which burnt-offerings can be brought: <b>Bulls, calves, goats, rams, kids, and lambs.</b> Each collection horn was for the funds designated for a particular type of animal. <b>Shmuel said:</b> They <b>correspond to the six</b> obligatory <b>offerings</b> whose leftover funds were used for the purchase of burnt-offerings: (1) <b>Pairs</b> of birds offered in the purification ritual <b>of a <i>zav</i>, pairs</b> of birds <b>of a <i>zava</i>;</b> (2) <b>pairs</b> of birds <b>of a woman after childbirth;</b> (3) <b>sin-offerings;</b> (4) <b>guilt-offerings;</b> (5) <b>meal-offerings</b> of a sinner; <b>and</b> (6) <b>the tenth part of an ephah</b> brought each day by the High Priest as a meal-offering. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Since the free-will offerings are plentiful,</b> i.e., much money was donated for this purpose, there was a concern that if too many coins were placed in one horn, only the uppermost coins would be taken and the bottom ones would deteriorate. Therefore <b>they instituted many horns,</b> so that each horn contained fewer coins and the funds would be preserved properly. The Gemara discusses the midrash of Jehoiada the High Priest mentioned in the mishna. <b>It is written: “And when they had made an end, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada,</b> from which they made vessels for the house of the Lord, even vessels used in the Temple service” (II Chronicles 24:14). In explanation of this verse, <b>Rabbi Shimon bar Naḥman said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Jehoiada made two</b> chests for two different types of <b>voluntary donations,</b> one for maintaining the Temple and the other for free-will offerings. <sup><b>[19a]</b></sup> A dissenting opinion <b>was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>of the school of Rabbi Yishmael:</b> Jehoiada prepared a single chest for <b>one free-will offering, as it is written: “So the king commanded, and they made a chest”</b> (II Chronicles 24:8). The verse specifically states that Jehoiada made only one chest. This is the same chest mentioned elsewhere: <b>And he placed it in the Sanctuary of the House of God, “and he bored a hole in its lid”</b> (II Kings 12:10). The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “So the king commanded, and they made a chest, and set it without, at the gate of the House of the Lord”</b> (II Chronicles 24:8)? This indicates that that there was an additional chest that was placed outside the Temple. <b>Rav Ḥuna said:</b> There was only one chest, which was originally located inside the Temple by Jehoiada’s command. Afterward, however, he instructed that it should be placed outside the Temple <b>because of</b> those people who were <b>ritually impure</b> by contact with a corpse or a dead creeping animal. These people were unable to enter the Temple to insert their money for free-will offerings. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Yosef:</b> There were two free-will offerings in the Temple, as it is written: <b>“But there were not made for the House of the Lord cups of silver, snuffers,</b> basins, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the House of the Lord; for they gave that to them who did the work, and repaired with it the House of the Lord” (II Kings 12:14). These were for the repairs of the Temple, not for making sacred serving vessels. Conversely, the verses in II Chronicles discuss the construction of the vessels, as it is written: “From which they made vessels for the House of the Lord” (II Chronicles 24:14). As this verse refers to a different chest and a separate free-will offering, it shows that there were in fact two chests. "

                "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna taught the <i>halakha</i> governing the case where money was found between the horn marked shekels and a horn marked free-will offerings. The Gemara asks: Addressing this case <b>was not necessary,</b> as these horns were not adjacent to one another; the one marked shekels was the first horn and the last six were marked free-will offerings. Why should it be presumed that money found in the middle belongs to one or the other and not to one of the horns in between? <b>Rather [<i>dela</i>],</b> the mishna should have addressed the case where money was found <b>between</b> the horn marked old <b>shekels and</b> the horn marked <b>pairs</b> of bird-offerings, as they are adjacent to one another. <b>Rabbi Avun</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Pineḥas:</b> The contribution horns in the Temple <b>were arranged like a circle [<i>bukhliyar</i>].</b> The horns did not stand in a straight row, but rather in a circle, such that the horn marked new shekels and the horn marked free-will offerings were adjacent to one another from the other side. The mishna teaches that if money was found <b>equidistant</b> from the horn marked shekels and the horn marked free-will offerings, <b>it is allocated to free-will offerings.</b> The Gemara asks: The mishna <b>should not have</b> said that the money is allocated to free-will offerings. <b>Rather,</b> it should have said that when money is found <b>equidistant</b> from both, <b>it is allocated to shekels.</b> For the <i>halakha</i> governing the money in the horn marked shekels is more stringent, as the regular communal offerings are bought with that money, whereas the money in the horn marked free-will offerings is used only to buy offerings for those times when there are no regular offerings being sacrificed. The Gemara answers: <b>Some wish to say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> governing the money in the horn marked shekels is less stringent because <b>perhaps</b> the money allocated would not be used for the purchase of offerings, and consequently <b>it would be allocated to the remainders of the chamber</b> funds, i.e., those left over after the public offerings have been bought with the half-shekels collected in the chamber. Such money would be used for repairing the walls and towers of Jerusalem, and not for offerings. It is consequently preferable that the money be allocated to free-will offerings, and therefore be used for offerings. And <b>some wish to say</b> that money that is found <b>equidistant</b> from both is treated like money that has no owner, i.e., <b>like</b> money that was set aside by <b>someone who</b> subsequently <b>died,</b> and the Sages said that such money is allocated to free-will offerings. As <b>Rabbi Yesa said: While I was there</b> in Babylonia, <b>I heard the voice of Rav Yehuda who asked Shmuel</b> the following question: If someone <b>set aside his shekel and</b> subsequently <b>died,</b> what is to be done with the money? Shmuel <b>said to him: It is allocated to free-will offerings.</b> The Gemara now asks a similar question: The High Priest could set aside money to be used for the purchase of <b>his</b> daily griddle-cake offering made from <b>one-tenth of an ephah</b> of flour, half in the morning and half in the evening. If he died before the flour had been bought, what is to be done with the money? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The money must be <b>cast into the Dead Sea,</b> i.e., so that it is destroyed. <b>Rabbi Elazar</b> disagreed and <b>said:</b> The money <b>is allocated to free-will offerings.</b>",
                "The mishna taught that if the money was found equidistant from the horn marked pairs of bird-offerings, i.e., one burnt-offering and one sin-offering, and the horn marked doves for burnt-offerings, it is allocated to doves for burnt-offerings. <b>And</b> this is <b>difficult: Is a sin-offering brought as a burnt-offering?</b> Surely it is possible that the money fell from the horn marked pairs of bird-offerings, and is therefore partially designated for the purchase of sin-offerings. <b>Ḥizkiya</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: A condition of the court stipulates with regard to the remainder</b> of the money originally consecrated for sin-offerings <b>that it is brought</b> as <b>burnt-offerings.</b> Even if the one who consecrated the money did not state such a condition explicitly, he is regarded as having done so, as it is presumed that the money was consecrated in accordance with the court’s stipulation. The Gemara asks: If so, <b>with what does this woman,</b> who had placed the money for her offering in the horn marked pairs of bird-offerings, <b>achieve atonement?</b> A woman who had given birth or is a <i>zava</i> must bring a pair of bird-offerings, one as a burnt-offering and the other as a sin-offering, as part of her purification process. If that money has been allocated to doves for burnt-offerings, she has not completed the process. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: A condition of the court stipulates: Whoever supplies</b> the Temple with <b>the pairs</b> of birds, <b>he</b> also <b>supplies</b> extra birds to replace those birds that are <b>disqualified.</b> If one of the birds is disqualified or missing, he provides another bird in its place, and so in any event the woman will have brought both a burnt-offering and a sin-offering. The mishna did not consider all the possible places that money could be found between different horns, and so the Gemara asks: <b>Shouldn’t</b> the mishna <b>also</b> discuss additional cases, like where the money was found between the fourth and fifth horns, i.e., <b>between</b> the horn marked <b>incense and</b> the horn marked <b>wood,</b> or between the sixth and seventh horns, i.e., between the horn marked <b>frankincense and</b> the horn marked <b>gold for the Ark cover?</b> The Gemara answers: In fact, this mishna addresses these cases as well, <b>as it teaches at its end: This is the principle:</b> In cases of doubt, the ruling <b>follows whichever is closer,</b> even if this involves being lenient; but if the money was found <b>equidistant</b> from both, the ruling follows whichever attribution involves <b>being stringent.</b>"

                "<strong>Halakha 2 · MISHNA</strong> This mishna considers other situations in which something is found and its source is unknown. <b>Money found before animal merchants</b> in Jerusalem is <b>always</b> presumed to be second-<b>tithe</b> money. The presumption is based on the fact that in Jerusalem, most of the animals are bought with second-tithe money and sacrificed as peace-offerings. <b>And</b> money found <b>on the Temple Mount</b> is presumed to be <b>non-sacred</b> money. <b>And</b> with regard to money found <b>in</b> the rest of <b>Jerusalem,</b> the following distinction applies: If it was found <b>during the rest of the days of the year,</b> it is presumed to be <b>non-sacred</b> money, <b>but</b> if it was found <b>during the time of a pilgrim Festival,</b> it is <b>all</b> presumed to be second-<b>tithe</b> money, because most of the money found in Jerusalem at the time of a Festival is second-tithe money. The mishna continues: With regard to <b>meat that was found in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard,</b> and it is not known from whence it came, the <i>halakha</i> is as follows: If it is whole <b>limbs</b> of the animal, in the manner that burnt-offerings are brought to the altar, it is presumed to be <b>burnt-offerings. And</b> if it is in small <b>pieces,</b> it is presumed to be <b>sin-offerings. And</b> if the meat, in whatever form, is found <b>in</b> the city of <b>Jerusalem,</b> as opposed to the courtyard, it is presumed to be the meat of <b>peace-offerings,</b> as most of the meat in Jerusalem is the meat of peace-offerings. Since it is possible that the time during which it is permitted to eat any of it has already passed, both <b>this and that,</b> whether it is determined to be the meat of burnt-offerings or the meat of peace-offerings, <b>its form</b> must be allowed <b>to decay,</b> i.e., it must be left until it is definitely disqualified, <b>and</b> then <b>it must be taken out to the place of burning,</b> where offerings that have become disqualified are burned. With regard to meat <b>found in the outlying areas,</b> outside of Jerusalem, if it is in the form of whole <b>limbs,</b> the meat presumably comes from <b>carcasses</b> of animals that were not properly slaughtered, for meat unfit for eating was generally cut up into full limbs, to be fed to dogs or sold to gentiles. <b>But</b> if it is in small <b>pieces,</b> it is presumably kosher and <b>permitted</b> to be eaten, as kosher meat was ordinarily cut up into small pieces. <sup><b>[19b]</b></sup> <b>And</b> if meat is found <b>at the time of a Festival, when meat is plentiful,</b> so that it is generally not cut up into small pieces, then <b>even</b> whole <b>limbs are permitted</b> to be eaten.",
                "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that money found on the Temple Mount is presumed to be non-sacred money. The Gemara asks: <b>Shouldn’t the mishna</b> have said that the money found <b>on the Temple Mount</b> is treated as <b>consecrated</b> money? Most of the money on the Temple Mount is consecrated money, and even if it were not, one ought to be stringent and regard any found money as such. The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Ba</b> said that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> There is <b>a presumption that the priest</b> who is in charge <b>does not remove money from the chamber until he desacralizes it</b> by transferring its consecrated status <b>onto the animals</b> that he purchases for offerings. Therefore, any money that is found on the Temple Mount is presumably non-sacred money.",
                "The mishna teaches that <b>meat found</b> in the rest of the city of Jerusalem, cut into whole limbs or small pieces, is presumably from a peace-offering. However, it may not be eaten and its form must be allowed to decay, after which it is burned. The Gemara now cites what <b>Rabbi Elazar</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Hoshaya</b> and a proof for his opinion from the mishna: If <b>one diverted</b> his <b>attention</b> from sacrificial meat such that it was not protected from ritual impurity, even though the meat is disqualified, it is not burned immediately. Rather, it <b>must</b> be left over past the time permitted for its consumption in order that its <b>form decays.</b> <b>Rabbi Hoshaya said: The mishna says like that</b> with regard to meat that was found in Jerusalem, i.e., that <b>its form</b> must first be allowed <b>to decay and</b> then <b>it is taken out to the place of burning.</b> As the meat was lost, clearly its owner’s attention was diverted from it, and the meat became disqualified. The mishna rules that nevertheless it must be kept left over before it is burned, therefore supporting Rabbi Hoshaya’s ruling that meat from which one’s attention was diverted is not burned immediately but must be left over. The disqualification stems from the uncertainty whether the meat became impure, and the meat cannot be burned until its disqualification is certain. <b>Rabbi Yosei said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> of the mishna is indeed <b>correct,</b> but not for this reason. With regard to the meat that one found in Jerusalem, the reason <b>you may not eat it</b> is that <b>perhaps its form had</b> already <b>decayed.</b> Perhaps before it was found the time permitted for eating it had already elapsed. <b>Therefore, one must say</b> that <b>its form must</b> be allowed to <b>decay,</b> lest the allotted time has not elapsed, <b>and</b> only then <b>is it taken out to the place of burning.</b> The requirement that its form decay has nothing to do with the fact that the meat might have become impure. Since the meat was lost in Jerusalem, which is a public domain, it cannot become disqualified because of doubtful ritual impurity, as the principle is that any doubt about ritual impurity that arises in a public domain is declared ritually pure (<i>Teharot</i> 4:7).",
                "The mishna taught that with regard to meat <b>found in the outlying areas,</b> outside of Jerusalem, if it was whole limbs, the meat is presumably that of carcasses and therefore forbidden, but if it was found in small pieces it is presumably kosher and permitted to be eaten. <b>Rabbi Krispa</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina:</b> When the mishna says that <b>whole limbs are</b> presumed to come from <b>carcasses,</b> that presumption is determinate, to the extent that one who eats this meat <b>receives lashes for</b> eating the meat of unslaughtered <b>carcasses.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna</b> itself <b>says this,</b> i.e., the wording of the mishna implies this, for the mishna teaches: With regard to meat found in the outlying areas, outside of Jerusalem, if it is in the form of whole <b>limbs,</b> the meat presumably comes from <b>carcasses. And</b> if it is in small <b>pieces,</b> it is presumably kosher and <b>permitted</b> to be eaten. When the mishna says that <b>small pieces are permitted,</b> does it <b>not</b> mean that they are <b>actually</b> permitted, i.e., the mishna permits the eating of the small pieces of meat and does not regard it as an uncertainty? <b>In a corresponding manner,</b> when the mishna says that meat found in the form of <b>limbs</b> is presumably that of <b>carcasses,</b> this is regarded as a certainty, such that one who eats this meat <b>is flogged for</b> having violated the prohibition against eating the meat of <b>a carcass</b> that was not properly slaughtered.",
                "<b>Rabbi Krispa</b> said further <b>in the name of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> with regard to meat that was found in the form of whole limbs: <b>If</b> the meat <b>was</b> found strung together on strings like <b>beads,</b> it may be presumed that the meat is kosher, and it is therefore <b>permitted.</b> It was further taught in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to meat of an unknown source: If one bought meat in a town that has ten stores, <b>nine stores selling</b> the non-kosher <b>meat of a carcass and one</b> store <b>selling the meat of a</b> properly <b>slaughtered</b> animal, <b>and he was confused about them,</b> not remembering from which store he made his purchase, <b>he must be concerned</b> that perhaps he bought non-kosher meat. However, the meat is forbidden only because of an uncertainty, and if he ate it he is not liable to receive lashes. <b>And</b> if a piece of meat <b>was found</b> in the marketplace and it is not known from which store the meat came, <b>one follows the majority</b> of meat stores. Since in this scenario the majority of stores sell non-kosher meat, the found meat is presumed to be non-kosher. As for the reverse case, if <b>nine stores were selling the meat of a</b> properly <b>slaughtered</b> animal <b>and one</b> store <b>was selling</b> the non-kosher <b>meat of a carcass, and</b> one bought meat in one of the stores but <b>was confused about them,</b> not remembering from which store he made his purchase, <b>he must be concerned</b> that perhaps he bought non-kosher meat. <b>And</b> if a piece of meat <b>was found</b> in the marketplace and it is not known from which store the meat came, <b>one follows the majority</b> of meat stores, and presume that the meat is kosher.",
                "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> Meat <b>that is found in the hand of a gentile</b> is regarded <b>as if it were found in a large public square [<i>pelatya</i>],</b> and so its status is determined in accordance with the majority of stores in the town. It is related that <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Ḥaggai, was supporting Rabbi Mana,</b> helping him walk, when <b>he saw a certain Roman [<i>Armai</i>] lopping off</b> a piece of flesh <b>from his horse and taking it out</b> for sale. Rabbi Elazar <b>said to</b> Rabbi Mana: <b>Is this what Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> meant when he <b>said:</b> Meat <b>that is found in the hand of a gentile</b> is regarded <b>as if it were found in a large public square,</b> and so one follows the majority of stores in the town? If so, then if the majority of the town’s stores are owned by Jews, this meat should be treated as kosher. But surely it isn’t, as we saw where it came from. Rabbi Mana <b>said to</b> Rabbi Elazar: <b>Thus said Rabbi Yosei my teacher</b> about Rabbi Yoḥanan’s ruling: <b>This</b> ruling of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s applies only <b>where they saw</b> the gentile <b>exiting from a butcher shop belonging to a Jew</b> with a piece of meat in his hand. It is further related that <b>a certain man in Tzippori was walking</b> and <b>he wanted to buy a piece of meat [<i>kufad</i>] from the butcher, but</b> the butcher <b>did not give him</b> the meat, as they were at odds with each other. The man <b>asked a certain Roman</b> to buy the meat on his behalf, <b>and he brought him</b> the meat. The man later <b>said to</b> the butcher: <b>Did I not</b> in the end <b>take</b> the meat from you <b>against your will?</b> The butcher <b>said to him: Did I not give him the</b> non-kosher <b>meat of a carcass,</b> and so the meat you received from him was not kosher? <b>Rabbi Yirmeya</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina: An incident</b> like this <b>came before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who <b>said</b> about this: <b>It is not within his power to prohibit all the</b> butcher <b>shops [<i>makkulin</i>] of Tzippori</b> on that day; since the majority of meat shops in that city belong to Jews, the butcher’s claim that he gave the Roman non-kosher meat is not to be believed.",
                "It is related that <b>Rav went down there</b> to Babylonia and <b>saw that they were lenient</b> about meat of unknown origin, <b>and he was stringent with them.</b> The Gemara now reports what it is that Rav saw: <b>A certain man went</b> <sup><b>[20a]</b></sup> and <b>wanted to rinse his hat [<i>askuptei</i>] in the river.</b> While doing so, the piece of kosher meat he was carrying <b>fell and</b> the man <b>went</b> on his way. Afterward, <b>he returned</b> to that very place and found a piece of meat identical to the one that he had dropped, <b>and he wanted to take it. Rav,</b> however, <b>said to him:</b> This meat <b>is forbidden for you</b> to eat, <b>as I</b> can <b>say:</b> It is possible that <b>the river swept away that</b> piece of meat, <b>and brought in its place a different</b> piece of <b>non-kosher meat</b> that had fallen into the water somewhere else. The Gemara relates another incident where Rav was stringent about meat of doubtful provenance. <b>A certain man was walking in the market, carrying a piece of</b> kosher <b>meat. A kite</b> bird <b>came and snatched it from him, and</b> later <b>cast it</b> away elsewhere. The man <b>returned</b> and <b>wanted to take</b> the piece of meat from the place where he saw the bird drop it. <b>Rav,</b> however, <b>said to him:</b> This meat <b>is forbidden for you</b> to eat, <b>as I</b> can <b>say:</b> It is possible the kite <b>was carrying non-kosher meat and</b> that is what <b>it cast</b> away in this place. It then <b>took away the other</b> piece of meat that it snatched from you.",
                " It is further related that the <b>Gina’ei</b> river once <b>swept away wineskins</b> belonging to Jews, and the wineskins were later found along the riverbank. <b>The incident came before Rabbi Yitzḥak, son of Rabbi Elazar,</b> who <b>said: Let the</b> Jewish <b>wine-dealers</b> come and <b>examine the knots</b> on the wineskins. If they recognize the knots as theirs, the wineskins are presumably theirs, and the wine and the wineskins are permitted.",
                " It once happened that <b>a</b> wine <b>container [<i>nekonika</i>] was found in the synagogue of the</b> city <b>council [<i>bulei</i>],</b> and <b>the incident came before Rabbi Yirmeya</b> for a ruling. <b>He said: Let the</b> Jewish <b>markers,</b> i.e., those who paint the markings on the containers, <b>examine their work.</b> Only if they recognize it as theirs, is the wine permitted.",
                "It is further related that <b>a roasted goat was</b> once <b>found in the street</b> in the town of <b>Gufta, and</b> the Rabbis <b>permitted it</b> to be eaten <b>based on two considerations:</b> First, <b>because of found property;</b> that is to say, they allowed the finder to keep it. Secondly, <b>because of the majority of traffic,</b> i.e., the majority of people passing through that street were Jews. The Gemara explains: <b>Because of found property, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One</b> who rescues an article from a lion, from an enemy army [<i>gayyis</i>], from rocks in the <b>sea [<i>shunit hayam</i>], or from rocks in a river, or from a large</b> public <b>street [<i>isratya</i>], or from a large</b> public <b>square;</b> in all these cases, <b>these</b> articles <b>belong to him,</b> even if they have an identifying mark on them, <b>because the owners have given up hope of</b> ever recovering <b>them.</b> For this reason the Rabbis ruled that the goat belonged to its finder, as it was found on the street. The Rabbis also permitted the goat <b>because of the majority of traffic.</b> Since most of the people who passed through that street were Jews, it stands to reason that a Jew had lost the roast goat, and the Rabbis were not concerned <b>that</b> it was the product of <b>gentile slaughter</b> and therefore not kosher. The Gemara adds that in the end, the goat <b>was found</b> to be <b>from the house of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, and indeed kosher.",
                "The Gemara relates that <b>a wheel of cheese was</b> once <b>found in an inn [<i>pundaka</i>]</b> belonging <b>to Levi, and</b> the Rabbis <b>permitted it</b> to be eaten <b>based on two considerations: Because of found property</b> and <b>because of the majority of traffic.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Because of found property, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who rescues</b> an article <b>from an</b> enemy <b>army, from a lion, from rocks in the sea, or from rocks in a river, from a large</b> public <b>street, or from a large</b> public <b>square;</b> in all these cases, <b>these</b> articles <b>belong to him,</b> even if they have an identifying mark on them, <b>because the owners have given up hope of</b> ever recovering <b>them.</b> The same applies to something that was found in an inn, which is also a public area; its owner presumably gave up hope of getting it back, and so the finder is entitled to keep it for himself. The problem that was overcome <b>because of the majority of traffic,</b> was that perhaps the cheese should have been prohibited <b>because</b> it was <b>the cheese of a gentile.</b> Since the majority of the guests at the inn were Jews, this was not a concern. The Gemara notes that, in the end the wheel of cheese <b>was found</b> to be <b>from</b> the house of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei,</b> and was indeed kosher.",
                " <b>Rabbi Mana said in the presence of Rabbi Yosei: But I saw the Rabbis announcing</b> that they had found lost property, even when the item was found in a public area.

The Gemara notes that <b>even so,</b> when Rabbi Yona <b>found</b> a lost article in a crowded public place, <b>he did not take</b> it for himself, but rather announced that he had found it, so that he could locate its original owner."

                "<strong>Halakha 3 · MISHNA</strong> If <b>an animal</b> that is fit for the altar <b>was found</b> straying, <b>from Jerusalem and as far as Migdal Eder, and</b> similarly if it was found <b>within that distance</b> from Jerusalem <b>in any</b> other <b>direction,</b> it is presumed that the animal came from Jerusalem. Most of the animals in Jerusalem were designated for offerings, and presumably this one was as well. <b>Males</b> are presumed to be <b>burnt-offerings,</b> as only males are brought as burnt-offerings. <b>Females</b> are presumed to be <b>peace-offerings,</b> as it is permitted to bring a female peace-offering. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> An animal <b>that is fit for the Paschal offering,</b> i.e., a one-year-old male lamb or kid, is presumed to be <b>a Paschal offering,</b> provided that it was found <b>within thirty days before the Festival</b> of Passover. <b>Originally,</b> the court <b>would seize collateral from one who found</b> such an animal, as security <b>until he would bring with it the libations</b> associated with this offering, as if the found animal were his own and he had committed himself to bring the libations. This brought about a situation in which those who found the animals <b>began leaving them</b> where they found them, <b>and absconding,</b> so as not to become liable for the libations. <b>The court</b> therefore <b>instituted that the libations</b> accompanying these offerings <b>would come from public</b> funds, that is, from the Temple treasury. <b>Rabbi Shimon said: The court instituted seven ordinances</b> with regard to the financial aspects of offerings and consecrations. <b>And this</b> ordinance, namely, that the cost of the libations accompanying the sacrifice of a found animal is borne by the public, <b>is one of them.</b> These are the other ordinances: If <b>a gentile sent his burnt-offering from abroad,</b> outside Eretz Yisrael, <b>and he sent with it</b> money for the purchase of the <b>libations</b> that must accompany it, the libations <b>are offered at his</b> expense. <b>And if</b> the gentile <b>did not</b> cover the cost of the libations, it is a condition of the court that the libations are <b>sacrificed at the public’s</b> expense, with funds taken from the Temple treasury. <b>And likewise,</b> in the case of <b>a convert who died</b> without heirs <b>and left</b> animals that he had designated as <b>offerings. If he has the libations,</b> i.e., if he also had set aside libations or money for that purpose, the libations <b>are sacrificed from his</b> estate. <b>And if</b> he did <b>not</b> do so, the libations <b>are sacrificed from public</b> funds. <b>And</b> another ordinance: <b>It is a condition of the court with regard to a High Priest who died,</b> and a new High Priest had not yet been appointed in his place, <b>that his meal-offering,</b> i.e., the griddle-cake offering that the High Priest would bring each day from one-tenth of an ephah of flour, would be <b>sacrificed from public</b> funds. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> It was brought <b>from</b> the property of the High Priest’s <b>heirs,</b> i.e., his estate, and not from public funds. In any event, the offering was not brought as it would have been brought by the High Priest himself were he still alive, half in the morning and half in the evening, <b>but</b> rather <b>it was sacrificed</b> all at once, from a <b>whole</b> one-tenth of an ephah. The fourth ordinance was <b>about the salt</b> in the Temple that was designated for salting the offerings, <b>and</b> the fifth was <b>about the wood</b> that was used for the burning of the offerings. These ordinances decreed <b>that the priests may use them</b> also to prepare the meat of the offerings that they eat. <b>And</b> the sixth ordinance <b>concerned the</b> red <b>heifer: that</b> deriving benefit <b>from its ashes is not considered misusing</b> consecrated property. <b>And</b> the seventh ordinance was <b>about disqualified pairs</b> of bird-offerings: It ruled <b>that</b> their replacements <b>should come from public</b> funds. <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> disagreed and <b>says:</b> The expense does not fall upon the public, but rather upon <b>whoever supplies</b> all <b>the pairs</b> of bird-offerings to the Temple; <b>he must</b> also <b>supply,</b> at no additional charge, the replacements for <b>the disqualified</b> birds.",
                "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna taught that if a male animal was found near Jerusalem, it is presumed to have been consecrated as a burnt-offering. Given that a male animal could just as easily be a peace-offering, and as such, most of its meat is meant to be eaten and it is prohibited to burn it on the altar, how can the found animal be sacrificed as a burnt-offering? In answer to this question, <b>Rabbi Hoshaya Rabba said: They taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> that it is presumed to be a burnt-offering only <b>with regard to one who comes with its money,</b> i.e., the money with which the animal was redeemed. One who finds such an animal near Jerusalem may not bring it as a burnt-offering, as it might be a peace-offering. He must redeem the animal for its monetary value, and in addition he must consecrate the same sum again, from his own money. He then stipulates the following: If the animal is a burnt-offering, let it be redeemed on the first sum, and let the second sum be used for a free-will peace-offering. If this animal is a peace-offering, let it be redeemed on the second sum, and let the first sum be used for a free-will burnt-offering. He then purchases a burnt-offering with the first sum and a peace-offering with the second sum. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to him: Does one say to a person</b> that he should <b>go out and misuse consecrated animals?</b> If one redeems a consecrated animal that is still fit for the altar, the redemption is valid; the animal is no longer consecrated and the money is now sacred in its place and must be used to buy other offerings. This redemption, however, is valid only after the fact; it is considered misuse to redeem an unblemished animal and prohibited to do so <i>ab initio</i>. <b>Rather,</b> the mishna must be understood differently. <b>In their regard, follow the majority. If the majority</b> of the animals found <b>are males,</b> they are determined to be <b>burnt-offerings,</b> for most male animals brought as offerings are burnt-offerings. And <b>if the majority</b> of the animals found <b>are females,</b> they are determined to be <b>peace-offerings,</b> for most female animals brought as offerings are peace-offerings. The Gemara asks: <b>But are peace-offerings not brought</b> both <b>from males and from females?</b> Therefore, it is possible that the male animals that were found are not burnt-offerings, but rather peace-offerings. Rather, Rabbi Yoḥanan’s words must be understood as follows: If one finds animals near Jerusalem, even though they are presumed to be offerings, he cannot sacrifice the animals themselves on the altar. <b>What</b> then <b>does he do? He must</b> wait until the animals develop blemishes and only then redeem them, and thereby <b>remove</b> their consecrated status and restore them <b>to their non-sacred state. He then goes back and</b> ensures that he makes them <sup><b>[20b]</b></sup> <b>burnt-offerings.</b> He does this by taking two unblemished animals and stipulating as follows: If the animal that was found was a burnt-offering, let the first animal be a burnt-offering in its place, and let the second be a peace-offering. And if the animal that was found was a peace-offering, let the second animal be peace-offering, and let the first be a free-will burnt-offering. <b>Rabbi Zeira</b> offers a different explanation of the <i>halakha</i> in the mishna: Male animals found near Jerusalem are sacrificed as burnt-offerings, even though they may have been designated as peace-offerings. He <b>says: Just as you say there</b> (19a) in the name of Reish Lakish that <b>it is a condition of the court</b> that stipulates <b>with regard to funds left over</b> from what had originally been consecrated for sin-offerings that they <b>are brought as burnt-offerings; so too, you say here</b> that <b>it is a condition of the court with regard to</b> animals that were <b>lost</b> and later found, that even though they may be peace-offerings, they <b>are brought as burnt-offerings.</b> <b>Rabbi Yosei said to Rabbi Yaakov bar Aḥa: Is this not</b> a case of <b>intentional</b> change of an offering’s purpose? A condition of the court can allocate leftover money that had originally been consecrated for sin-offerings to the purchase of a burnt-offering, but that does not mean that one can intentionally change the sanctity of the animal itself from that of a peace-offering to that of a burnt-offering. Rabbi Yaakov bar Aḥa <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yosei: <b>Since it is a condition of the court, it is not</b> considered a case of <b>intentional</b> change of an animal’s purpose. Even if the animal had initially been consecrated as a peace-offering, that consecration is regarded as conditional in accordance with the court’s stipulation. Consequently, the animal can now be sacrificed as a burnt-offering <i>ab initio</i>.",
                "§ Since the mishna mentioned the griddle-cake offering of a High Priest who had died, the Gemara records what <b>Rabbi Yesa said</b> about similar matters: <b>While I was there</b> in Babylonia, <b>I heard the voice of Rav Yehuda asking Shmuel:</b> If one <b>set aside his shekel and</b> then <b>died</b> before handing it over to the treasurer, what is to be done with the shekel? Shmuel <b>said to him: It is allocated to free-will offerings</b> and is used for the purchase of free-will burnt-offerings. It was further asked: What is to be done with <b>leftover</b> money that a High Priest set aside for the purchase of his griddle-cake offering made from <b>one-tenth of an ephah</b> of flour? If a High Priest designated money for the purchase of flour for his meal-offering and it turns out that he set aside too much money, what is to be done with the extra money? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The money <b>goes to the Dead Sea,</b> meaning, it is destroyed. <b>Rabbi Elazar</b> disagreed and <b>said:</b> The money <b>is allocated to free-will offerings.</b>",
                "The Gemara continues its discussion of the High Priest’s griddle-cake offering. The mishna in <i>Menaḥot</i> 4:5 teaches that it was divided in two; half of it was sacrificed in the morning and half in the evening. The Gemara records a dispute among the <i>amora’im</i>: With regard to <b>the High Priest’s one-tenth of an ephah, Rabbi Yoḥanan said: He divides it</b> into two equal portions in two non-sacred vessels, <b>and afterward he consecrates</b> each half by itself before it is sacrificed. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: He must</b> first <b>consecrate</b> the entire one-tenth of an ephah, <b>and</b> only <b>afterward does he divide it</b> into two equal portions. The Gemara comments: <b>A mishna</b> seems to <b>disagree with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> as the mishna (<i>Menaḥot</i> 4:5) teaches that if the High Priest sacrificed half of his griddle-cake offering in the morning and then died, and another High Priest was appointed in his place, the successor does not bring the second half that evening. Instead <b>he</b> consecrates a whole one-tenth of an ephah and divides it into two equal portions. He then <b>sacrifices</b> one <b>half, and the</b> second <b>half is destroyed.</b> According to Rabbi Yoḥanan, who says that the High Priest consecrates each half by itself, why must the second half be destroyed? It had never been consecrated for the altar, and so it can still be redeemed. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>solves it,</b> i.e., resolves the difficulty: The mishna maintains that even though the second half is consecrated only for its value and not for the altar, it still must be destroyed. <b>As even</b> what is left over from the <b>money</b> that a High Priest set aside for the purchase of his griddle-cake offering <b>goes to the Dead Sea,</b> although it had never been consecrated for the altar. The Gemara notes that <b>the</b> same <b>mishna</b> also seems to <b>disagree with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish.</b> The mishna teaches that in the aforementioned case where the High Priest dies before sacrificing the second half of his griddle-cake offering and is succeeded on the same day, <b>it turns out that two halves</b> of the griddle-cake offering <b>are sacrificed,</b> i.e., the first half from the deceased High Priest and the first half from his successor, <b>and two halves are destroyed,</b> i.e., the second half of each offering. <b>And it was taught about</b> this mishna in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b>half of the first</b> High Priest <b>and the half of the second</b> High Priest that are destroyed, i.e., that which is left over once each of them has sacrificed half of one-tenth of an ephah, <b>their form</b> must first be allowed <b>to decay,</b> i.e., they must be left overnight until they are disqualified, <b>and</b> only then <b>are they taken out to the place of burning.</b> According to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish that the High Priest consecrates for the altar the entire one-tenth of an ephah before dividing it, there is no reason to wait for the form to decay. The principle is that if anything becomes intrinsically disqualified such that it cannot be sacrificed, it is burned immediately (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 34b). Therefore, it should be possible to immediately burn each disqualified, leftover half from each High Priest, and not wait for their forms to decay. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish <b>solves</b> this difficulty by arguing that the mishna, and his own opinion, which is an interpretation of the mishna, does not accord with the <i>baraita</i> but rather <b>with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> (<i>Menaḥot</i> 90a), <b>who says</b> that <b>the one-tenth</b> of an ephah <b>measure</b> is regarded as a sacred service vessel that <b>consecrates</b> its contents. The flour is therefore consecrated for the altar at the original measuring of the one-tenth of the ephah. Accordingly, the remaining half of each one-tenth of an ephah is destroyed immediately without decay of form. The <i>baraita</i>, on the other hand, does not consider the one-tenth of an ephah measure to be a sacred service vessel, and therefore the measure does not consecrate the flour. As long as the remaining halves have not been consecrated for the altar, they are consecrated only for their value and require decay of form before they are burned. § As the topic of the griddle-cake offering brought each day by the High Priest has been raised, the Gemara elaborates on it and on the inaugural meal-offering brought by each and every priest the first time that he serves in the Temple. It was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>When a priest approaches</b> the altar <b>for the first time to</b> perform <b>the service, he brings his</b> meal-offering from <b>one-tenth of an ephah</b> of flour <b>and he performs the service himself,</b> and in this way he inaugurates himself for service. Nevertheless, for <b>both a High Priest and an ordinary priest who performed the</b> sacrificial <b>service before bringing their</b> meal-offerings from <b>one-tenth of an ephah</b> of flour as their inaugural meal-offerings, <b>their service is valid,</b> as the absence of a priest’s inaugural meal-offerings does not invalidate his service. <b>Rabbi Mana wanted to say</b> the following <i>halakha</i>: If <b>on the same day that</b> a priest <b>approached</b> the altar <b>to</b> perform <b>the service for the first time, on that same day he was</b> also <b>appointed to be the High Priest, he must bring two</b> meal-offerings, each one-tenth of an ephah of flour; <b>one for his inaugural</b> meal-offering <b>and one for the obligation of the day,</b> i.e., for the griddle-cake offering that the High Priest must bring every day.",
                "The Gemara records another <i>halakha</i> with regard to the daily griddle-cake offering brought by the High Priest. Concerning this offering, the verse states: “On a griddle it shall be made with oil; when it is soaked, you shall bring it in; and <b>baked pieces</b> of the meal-offering shall you offer for a sweet savor unto the Lord” (Leviticus 6:14). The juxtaposition of the words “you shall bring it in” to the words “and baked pieces” teaches that <b>at the time</b> that the meal-offering <b>is brought,</b> it is made into <b>baked pieces,</b> i.e., during that same day, <b>and not before daybreak</b> is it made into <b>baked pieces.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Tamid</i> 1:3) that every day before the removal of the ashes from the altar, which was before daybreak, <b>they assigned whoever made the griddle-cake offerings to make,</b> i.e., bake, <b>griddle-cakes? Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Aḥa said:</b> All that they assigned him to do was <b>to heat water for the boiling</b> of the dough as part of the preparation of the griddle-cakes for the day. Having mentioned the baking of the High Priest’s griddle-cake offering, the Gemara addresses the various stages in the preparation of the offering. The verse implies that the offering must be fried, as it says: “On a griddle it shall be made with oil”; it also indicates that it must be scalded in water, as it says: “When it is soaked”; and it further teaches that it must be baked, as it says: “And <b>baked pieces</b> of the meal-offering shall you offer for a sweet savor unto the Lord.” As for the order of these procedures, <b>Rabbi Yesa</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina: He</b> first <b>fries it, and afterward he bakes it. Rabbi Aḥa</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina: He</b> first <b>bakes it, and</b> only <b>afterward does he fry it.</b> The Gemara notes that this dispute depends on another tannaitic dispute, as it was taught in a <i>baraita</i> that says with regard to the High Priest’s griddle-cake offering: “And <b>baked pieces [<i>tufinei</i>]</b> of the meal-offering” (Leviticus 6:14). This word is interpreted as <b>it shall be baked when</b> it is already <b>half done [<i>te’afena na</i>],</b> meaning that it is fried before it is baked. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The word for baked pieces <b>[<i>tufinei</i>]</b> should be understood as meaning <b>it must be baked when</b> still <b>beautiful [<i>te’afena na’a</i>],</b> i.e., before it is fried. <b>Rabbi Dosa says: It shall be baked in an amplified</b> manner, i.e., more than once. The Gemara explains: <b>These disputes follow,</b> i.e., match, <b>those disputes</b> mentioned earlier. <b>The one who says,</b> i.e., understands <i>tufinei</i> to mean that <b>it must be baked when</b> still <b>beautiful [<i>te’afena na’a</i>] is like the one who says</b> that <b>he</b> first <b>bakes it, and afterwards fries it. And the one who says</b> <i>tufinei</i> should be interpreted as baked <b>when half done [<i>te’afena na</i>] is like the one who says</b> that <b>he</b> first <b>fries it, and</b> only <b>afterward does he bake it.</b>",
                "The Gemara above cited the mishna in tractate <i>Menaḥot</i> that teaches that in the event of the death of the High Priest after having brought his morning griddle-cake offering, if another High Priest is appointed that same day, the successor brings one-tenth of an ephah of his own, divides it into two, and offers one half for the evening griddle-cake offering. The Gemara clarifies this matter: <b>Is this not the end of it,</b> that is to say, is the <i>halakha</i> not restricted to the case <b>where</b> the High Priest <b>died? Rather, even if</b> he <b>became</b> ritually <b>impure</b> after having brought the morning griddle-cake offering, another High Priest must bring a whole one-tenth of an ephah, divide it into two equal portions, and then sacrifice one half as the evening griddle-cake offering. And all the more so is this true, in accordance with this ruling, if the first High Priest was permanently disqualified because he became disfigured by a blemish. The Gemara suggests an alternative: The mishna’s ruling extends <b>even</b> to cases where the first High Priest is found <b>unfit because of a</b> permanent <b>blemish.</b> This scenario would require his successor to bring a new one-tenth of an ephah. However, in accordance with this ruling, temporary disqualification due to ritual impurity would not require the temporary High Priest to bring a separate meal-offering. <b>Rabbi Yehuda bar Pazzi of Bar Delaya taught: Even</b> the first High Priest being found <b>unfit because of a</b> permanent <b>blemish</b> would require his successor to bring a new one-tenth of an ephah. However, if the first High Priest became ritually impure and only temporarily suspended from his position, the second High Priest may use the first High Priest’s leftover half-tenth of an ephah for the evening griddle-cake offering. The mishna records a dispute among <i>tanna’im</i> with regard to the case of a High Priest who died. The first opinion is that until a new High Priest has been appointed, the griddle-cake offering is brought from public funds. Rabbi Yehuda disagrees, and argues that it should come from the property of the High Priest’s heirs. The Gemara recounts a <i>baraita</i> about this issue: <b>From where is it derived that</b> if <b>the High Priest died and another</b> High Priest <b>had not</b> yet <b>been appointed in his place, that his meal-offering should be brought from</b> the property of <b>the</b> High Priest’s <b>heirs? The verse states</b> with regard to this offering: “And the anointed priest that shall be in his stead <b>from among his sons shall bring it”</b> (Leviticus 6:15). That is to say, he sacrifices it from the property of the sons of the High Priest. I <b>might</b> have thought that the heirs <b>should bring</b> this meal-offering <b>in halves,</b> half in the morning and half in the evening, as it is ordinarily brought by the High Priest. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “Shall bring <b>it”</b> (Leviticus 6:15); <b>I said</b> that he should bring <b>all of it</b> as a single offering, and not in halves. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> <b>Rabbi Shimon says: It comes only from public</b> funds collected in the Temple treasury, <b>as it is stated:</b> “It is a <b>statute forever</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 6:15), to be brought from <b>those with whom a covenant was made,</b> i.e., from the community with whom God entered into a covenant. The verse continues: <b>“It shall be wholly burnt,”</b> from which it may be derived that the griddle-cake offering is <b>to be burnt in its entirety.</b> In contrast to most meal-offerings, a handful of flour is not separated to be burned on the altar and no part of it is eaten by the priests, but rather the entire offering is burned on the altar.",
                "Returning to the dispute with regard to a <b>High Priest who died, etc.,</b> whether the griddle-cake offering is brought from the his estate or comes from public funds, <b>Rabbi Ba bar Memel,</b> in the context of a parallel discussion (<i>Menaḥot</i> 51b), <b>raised a difficulty:</b> It would seem that the attribution of <b>the opinion of Rabbi Shimon is reversed. There,</b> that is, according to the mishna in <i>Shekalim</i>, <b>he says</b> that the original, Torah law was that the griddle-cake offering should be brought <b>from</b> the property of the late High Priest’s <b>heirs.</b> This is indicated by the fact that according to Rabbi Shimon, the griddle-cake offering is brought from public funds only by rabbinic ordinance as a condition of the court, implying that prior to the institution of the ordinance, the <i>halakha</i> was that it be brought from the late High Priest’s estate. <b>Whereas here,</b> that is, in the <i>baraita</i> above and in tractate <i>Menaḥot</i>, Rabbi Shimon <b>says</b> that by Torah law it comes <b>from public</b> funds, as according to his opinion it is derived from the wording of the Torah: “It is a statute forever.” <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> <sup><b>[21a]</b></sup> <b>bar Ba said: Isn’t the difficulty</b> raised by Rabbi Ba bar Memel <b>legitimate?</b> The Gemara answers that when <b>Rabbi Yaakov bar Aḥa came,</b> he said that <b>Rabbi Abbahu</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> In the case where the High Priest has died and not yet been replaced, <b>by Torah law,</b> the griddle-cake offering <b>comes from public</b> funds, as is derived from the words: “It is a statute forever.” Rabbi Shimon did not mean to imply otherwise. As it is not a public offering but the High Priest’s personal one, <b>I might have said</b> that it should be <b>collected from the heirs’</b> property. Therefore, to ensure compliance with the Torah law, the Sages <b>instituted that it should come from the collection of the</b> Temple treasury <b>chamber.</b>",
                "§ The mishna taught that a griddle-cake offering that was brought in the interim between the tenures of two High Priests was not brought in halves, morning and evening. Instead, a whole one-tenth of an ephah was sacrificed. <b>Rabbi Yosei said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised a dilemma: What</b> does this mean? Is a <b>whole</b> one-tenth of an ephah brought <b>in the morning, and</b> then a <b>whole</b> one-tenth of an ephah again <b>in the evening? Or</b> was a <b>whole</b> one-tenth of an ephah brought <b>in the morning,</b> and since they already brought one-tenth of an ephah that day, it <b>was canceled in the evening?</b> <b>When</b> that question <b>was resolved for him,</b> it gave rise to other questions. The original question was resolved by reference to the verse, <b>as it is written:</b> “This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the Lord in the day when he is anointed: The tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a <b>meal-offering perpetually,</b> half of it in the morning, and half thereof in the evening” (Leviticus 6:13). The word “perpetually” indicates that the griddle-cake offering is always brought both in the morning and in the evening. A further question: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>three <i>log</i></b> of oil that the High Priest would bring every day together with his griddle-cake offering, half in the morning and half in the evening? Is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the oil the same, i.e., that <b>three <i>log</i></b> of oil were brought in the <b>morning and three <i>log</i></b> of oil were brought again <b>in the evening? Or</b> was only <b>a <i>log</i> and a half</b> brought in the <b>morning and</b> another <b><i>log</i> and a half</b> brought <b>in the evening?</b> <b>Rabbi Ḥizkiya said</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>also wonders about this: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>two handfuls</b> of frankincense that were ordinarily brought every day together with the High Priest’s griddle-cake offering, one with the morning offering and the other together with the evening offering? Is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the frankincense the same as that of the griddle-cake offering, i.e., that <b>two handfuls</b> of frankincense were brought <b>in the morning and two handfuls</b> of frankincense were brought again <b>in the evening? Or</b> was only <b>one handful</b> brought <b>in the morning and one handful</b> brought <b>in the evening?</b> <b>Rabbi Yosei said: Didn’t they learn</b> (18b) that the amount of frankincense brought along with a meal-offering must be <b>a handful</b> by way of analogy <b>to</b> the handful of flour that must be taken <b>from a sinner’s meal-offering?</b> This being the case, the <i>halakha</i> in the issue under discussion should also be learned from the <i>halakha</i> governing meal-offerings in general. <b>Just as there,</b> when the quantity of flour is doubled <b>two handfuls</b> of frankincense are required, <b>here too,</b> since two-tenths of an ephah are brought, the measure of the frankincense must also be doubled, that is to say, <b>two handfuls</b> are required. The Gemara rejects this proof: Whether the measure of frankincense is doubled when a meal-offering is doubled is not completely clear: <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to meal-offerings in general, <b>he requires</b> a resolution, i.e., he does not know the answer as to whether a double measure of frankincense is required when the quantity of flour is doubled, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the High Priest’s griddle-cake offering, <b>he requires</b> a resolution as to whether a double measure is required. <b>Rabbi Ḥizkiya</b> addresses the previous question about the three <i>log</i> of oil brought as part of the High Priest’s griddle-cake offering. He <b>said: Didn’t they learn</b> that <b>three <i>log</i></b> of oil must be brought along with the griddle-cake offering <b>from the daily evening offering,</b> as this is the measure of oil that must be brought as part of this offering? Accordingly, <b>just as there,</b> in the case of the daily evening offering the measure of oil is <b>three <i>log</i></b> per one-tenth of an ephah of flour, <b>so too</b> in the case where the griddle-cake offering is brought from a whole one-tenth of an ephah, it is accompanied by <b>three <i>log</i></b> of oil both in the morning and in the evening. The Gemara rejects this proof as well: <b>And just as there,</b> when the daily meal offering is doubled <b>he requires</b> a resolution with regard to the measure of oil, <b>here too</b> with regard to the High Priest’s griddle-cake offering, <b>he requires</b> a resolution as to whether only the original three <i>log</i> are brought, or whether three <i>log</i> are brought for each measure of one-tenth of an ephah of flour.",
                "§ The mishna taught that one who derives benefit from the ashes of a red heifer <b>is not</b> liable for misusing property consecrated to the Temple. <b>Rabbi Shimon bar Naḥman</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Yonatan: By</b> Torah <b>law</b> one <b>should be liable for misusing it,</b> i.e., the ashes of a red heifer, as it is consecrated to the Temple, <b>but</b> the Sages <b>decreed that one is not liable.</b> This, however, is difficult, <b>as it was taught</b> otherwise in the following <i>baraita</i>: With regard to a red heifer, the verse states: “It is <b>a sin-offering”</b> (Numbers 19:9), which <b>teaches</b> that a red heifer is treated like a sin-offering in that <b>one is liable for misusing</b> consecrated property <b>with it,</b> i.e., the animal itself. Only <b>with it,</b> the animal itself, is one <b>liable for misusing</b> consecrated property, <b>but he is not liable for misusing</b> consecrated property <b>with its ashes.</b> Therefore, it is clear from the <i>baraita</i> that by Torah law one is not liable for misusing the ashes of a red heifer. <b>Rabbi Abbahu said:</b> Indeed, there is no liability by Torah law for misusing the ashes of a red heifer. <b>At first,</b> however, the priests would treat the sanctity of the ashes lightly and <b>would clean themselves [<i>mishtakshekin</i>] with them and</b> even <b>apply them to their wounds</b> as medicine. <b>And</b> the Sages therefore <b>decreed that one becomes liable for misusing</b> consecrated property <b>with them,</b> the ashes. But <b>when</b> they saw that the priests <b>restrained themselves</b> and no longer used the ashes for anything except purification water, the Sages reverted to the Torah law and <b>decreed that one does not become liable for misusing</b> consecrated property if he derives benefit from a red heifer’s ashes.",
                "§ The mishna taught, <b>with regard to</b> the replacements for <b>disqualified pairs</b> of bird-offerings, that they should come from public funds. Rabbi Yosei disagreed and said that whoever supplies all the pairs of bird-offerings to the Temple must also supply, at no extra charge, the replacements for the disqualified birds. Having mentioned the pairs of bird-offerings, the Gemara repeats the discussion from earlier in the chapter. The mishna there (19a) taught that if money was found between the horn marked pairs of bird-offerings and the horn marked doves for burnt-offerings, it is allocated to doves for burnt-offerings, and is used exclusively for that purpose. The Gemara asks: If so, <b>how does this woman,</b> who had placed the money for her offering in the horn marked pairs of bird-offerings, <b>achieve atonement?</b> A woman who gave birth or is a <i>zava</i> must bring a pair of bird-offerings, one as a burnt-offering and the other as a sin-offering, as part of her purification process. If that money has now been allocated to doves for burnt-offerings, she has not completed the process. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: It is a condition of the court that</b> whoever <b>supplies</b> the Temple with <b>the pairs</b> of birds, <b>he</b> also <b>supplies</b> extra birds to replace those birds that are <b>disqualified or lost.</b> Therefore, in any event the woman will have brought both a burnt-offering and a sin-offering.

                "<strong>Halakha 1 · MISHNA</strong> The mishna discusses the ritual purity of items found either in the Temple or in Jerusalem and its environs, in continuation of the previous chapter’s discussion of found money, animals, or meat. <b>All the spittle that is found in Jerusalem is ritually pure.</b> Since neither ritually impure people nor gentiles were commonly present in Jerusalem, the Sages decreed an exception to the rule that spittle that is found is ritually impure since it presumably comes from one of those groups. This is the case <b>except for</b> spittle found <b>in the upper marketplace,</b> where gentiles and ritually impure Jews were likely to be present. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> <b>Rabbi Yosei says: On all the other days of the year,</b> i.e., any day that is not on one of the three pilgrim Festivals, Passover, <i>Shavuot</i>, and <i>Sukkot</i>, spittle <b>that</b> is found <b>in the middle</b> of the street is <b>ritually impure,</b> and spittle <b>that</b> is found on <b>the sides</b> of the street is <b>ritually pure.</b> According to Rabbi Yosei, it was common for people who were ritually impure to be present in the streets of Jerusalem. They would be careful to walk in the middle of the street, while the ritually pure who wished to remain so would walk on the sides. Therefore, it is reasonable to presume that spittle found in the middle of the street is from one who is impure, while spittle found on the side of the street is from one who is pure. <b>But during the time of the Festival,</b> when most of the people in Jerusalem were there for the Festival and were ritually pure, the spittle found <b>in the middle</b> of the street was <b>ritually pure,</b> and that found on <b>the sides</b> of the street was <b>ritually impure.</b> The difference is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> at the time of the Festival, <b>the</b> ritually impure <b>minority moves to the sides</b> of the streets. The mishna continues: <b>All the vessels that are found in Jerusalem</b> on the <b>way down into the bathhouse,</b> wherein one purifies vessels in a ritual bath, are <b>ritually impure, and</b> those that are found on the <b>way up</b> are <b>ritually pure.</b> The mishna explains: <b>Their descent</b> into the bathhouse <b>is not</b> by the same route <b>as their ascent</b> out of it, and it can be assumed that those found on the way down have not yet been immersed, while those found on the way up have been. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> However, <b>Rabbi Yosei says: They are all ritually pure, except for the basket, and the shovel, and the <i>meritza</i>, which are specifically used for graves,</b> to gather up the bones of the dead. These tools must be presumed to be ritually impure, but in general, vessels are presumed to be pure. The mishna continues with another ruling about ritual purity: One may <b>slaughter immediately with a knife that was found on the fourteenth</b> of Nisan, i.e., the day the Paschal lamb is slaughtered, and need not be concerned that it is ritually impure. Presumably it was immersed the day before so that it could be used to slaughter the Paschal offering. If he found it <b>on the thirteenth</b> of Nisan, he <b>immerses</b> it <b>again.</b> Perhaps its owners had not yet immersed it, since they still had time to do so before the evening. If one finds a <b>cleaver [<i>kofitz</i>],</b> which is used to slaughter an animal and break its bones, whether it was <b>on this</b> day, i.e., the fourteenth, or <b>on that</b> day, i.e., the thirteenth, <b>he immerses</b> it <b>again</b> out of doubt. Since breaking the bones of the Paschal lamb is prohibited, its owners would have no need for it on the fourteenth, and it cannot be presumed that it has already been immersed to make it ritually pure. However, if the <b>fourteenth occurs on Shabbat,</b> he may <b>slaughter with</b> the cleaver <b>immediately.</b> Since immersing a vessel is prohibited on Shabbat, and presumably the owner of the cleaver wants it to be ritually pure on the fifteenth, one can assume that he immersed it already on Friday, the thirteenth of Nisan. It is therefore ritually pure. <sup><b>[21b]</b></sup> If the cleaver was found <b>on the fifteenth</b> of Nisan, i.e., if it was found on the Festival itself, he may <b>slaughter with it immediately.</b> The owners of the cleaver would have immersed it so that they could use it on the fifteenth to cut up the bones of a Festival peace-offering. If the cleaver <b>was found attached to a knife, it is like a knife,</b> i.e., if it was found on the thirteenth of Nisan it is presumed impure, and if it was found on the fourteenth he may slaughter with it immediately, as it was certainly immersed on the day before.",
                "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna taught that according to Rabbi Meir, all spittle that is found in Jerusalem is ritually pure, except if it were found in the upper marketplace. With regard to this, <b>Rabbi Avin in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> explains: <b>A fortress [<i>katzran</i>] of gentiles was there</b> in the upper marketplace. The Sages decreed that gentiles have the ritual impurity of a <i>zav</i> (see <i>Shabbat</i> 17b and <i>Nidda</i> 34a), therefore their spittle is impure. The Roman soldiers were gentiles, so any spittle found in the upper marketplace was presumably theirs. The Gemara recounts an incident about this fortress. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said:</b> Once <b>they were killing wild donkeys in Jerusalem,</b> to feed the lions in the circus (see <i>Menaḥot</i> 103b), <b>and the pilgrims</b> coming to Jerusalem to celebrate <b>the Festival were wading in blood up to their ankles</b> from the large amount of blood coming from the wild donkeys. <b>And they came before the Sages</b> to find out if they had been rendered ritually impure, <b>and they,</b> the Sages, <b>did not say anything,</b> as the blood of an animal carcass does not render one ritually impure, even though the carcass itself does. Where did this story take place? <b>Rabbi Shimon bar Abba</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina: There was a gentile,</b> i.e., Roman, <b>fortress there,</b> in the upper marketplace of Jerusalem, and that was where they were killing the wild donkeys.",
                "Apropos the ritual impurity of blood from an animal carcass, the Gemara recounts that. <b>Rabbi Simon</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi:</b> There was <b>an incident</b> with regard to <b>a mule from Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s <b>household that died, and</b> the Sages <b>ruled its blood to be ritually pure</b> and not subject to the impurity imparted by an animal <b>carcass.</b> On this topic, <b>Rabbi Elazar asked Rabbi Simon: Up to how much</b> blood from an animal carcass does not render one ritually impure? <b>And he did not answer him. He</b> then went and <b>asked Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, <b>said to him: Up to</b> the size of a <b>quarter</b>-<i>log</i> <b>is ritually pure; more than that is ritually impure. And Rabbi Elazar was annoyed that Rabbi Simon did not respond with the <i>halakha</i></b> that the minimal size for ritual impurity is a quarter-<i>log</i>, as he certainly heard it from Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi. The Gemara continues: <b>Rav Beivai was sitting</b> and <b>teaching this story</b> of the mule from Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s household, in which the Sages ruled that the blood of a carcass does not render one impure. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Bisna said to him: Up to how much</b> blood from an animal carcass does not render one ritually impure? Rav Beivai <b>said to him: Up to</b> a <b>quarter</b>-<i>log</i> <b>is ritually pure; more than that is impure. And</b> then <b>he kicked him</b>. <b>Rabbi Zerika said to</b> Rav Beivai: <b>You kicked him because he asked you a question? He said to</b> Rabbi Zerika: <b>Because my mind was unsettled,</b> and not because he did anything wrong. <b>As Rabbi Ḥanin said</b> in expounding the verse: “And your life shall hang in doubt before you; and you shall fear night and day, and shall have no assurance of your life” (Deuteronomy 28:66). <b>“And your life shall hang in doubt before you”; this is one who buys for himself wheat for a year,</b> who has no financial security with regard to the following year. <b>“And you shall fear night and day”; this</b> is one who is so poor that <b>he buys</b> wheat <b>from the storekeeper</b> a bit at a time, with the attendant concern that he might not have enough for the morrow. <b>“And shall have no assurance of your life”; this is one who</b> is so poor <b>he buys from the baker</b> and cannot afford to buy wheat in advance to assure even one future meal. <b>And I rely on the baker,</b> i.e., I am on this lowest level of poverty, and therefore I do not have the presence of mind to answer his questions. The Gemara asks: <b>What then</b> is the halakhic ruling regarding the ritual impurity of the blood of an animal carcass? In response, the Gemara quotes a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 8:1): <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Petora testified that the blood of animal carcasses is ritually pure,</b> which implies that it is ritually pure regardless of the amount, even more than a quarter-<i>log</i>. The Gemara rejects this answer: <b>What</b> does the mishna mean by <b>ritually pure?</b> That such blood is <b>ritually pure</b> in that it does not <b>render</b> an item <b>susceptible</b> to impurity. Even though blood is one of the seven liquids that render an item susceptible to ritual impurity, the blood of an animal carcass is not deemed blood for this purpose. <b>Nevertheless, with regard to conferring impurity,</b> such blood <b>does render something ritually impure.</b> The Gemara asks: Didn’t <b>we learn</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Makhshirin</i> 6:5): <b>The blood of a creeping animal confers ritual impurity, as does its flesh? It confers impurity, but does not render an item susceptible</b> to impurity, <b>and we have nothing</b> else <b>like it</b> that confers impurity but does not render something susceptible to impurity. The implication is that the blood of an animal carcass would either both confer impurity and render an item susceptible to impurity or do neither. The Gemara answers: When the mishna said that we have nothing else like it, it meant that <b>we have nothing else like it with regard to the measure</b> required for this substance <b>to confer impurity.</b> The measure of both the blood and the flesh of a creeping animal required for conferring impurity is a lentil-bulk. Creeping animals are unique in this regard, since the measures of blood and flesh that confer impurity from an animal carcass are different. An olive-bulk of flesh is sufficient to confer impurity, while a quarter-<i>log</i> of blood is required. <b>However,</b> the Gemara concludes, <b>its blood,</b> i.e., that of an animal carcass, nevertheless <b>confers impurity like its flesh.</b> <b>Rabbi Yosei said: Two <i>amora’im</i> disputed this</b> point, whether the blood of an animal carcass confers ritual impurity. <b>One said</b> a quarter-<i>log</i> of this blood renders one <b>ritually impure, and one said</b> that even after contact with this blood, one remains <b>ritually pure.</b> <b>The one who said ritually impure</b> holds <b>like the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda</b> as it appears in a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 5:1). Rabbi Yehuda asserts there that this issue is the subject of a dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel. The <i>halakha</i> would follow the opinion of Beit Hillel, which is that carcass blood does confer impurity. <b>And the one who said ritually pure</b> holds <b>like</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Petora,</b> who testified (<i>Eduyyot</i> 8:1) that the blood of an animal carcass is ritually pure. It appears that this <i>amora</i> interprets Rabbi Yehoshua ben Petora’s statement literally, implying that even more than a quarter-<i>log</i> of blood does not confer impurity. <b>Rav Avduma of the descenders,</b> i.e., travelers from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, bringing with them the Torah taught in Eretz Yisrael, <b>said to him: And it is right,</b> that which you explained is correct, <b>as Rabbi Yehuda was the halakhic authority for the house of the <i>Nasi</i>.</b> Rabbi Yehuda ruled then that the blood of the dead mule was pure only because there was less than a quarter-<i>log</i> of it.",

The Gemara asks: <b>Didn’t Rabbi Abbahu say this in the name of Rabbi Yosei ben Ḥanina:</b> The Sages <b>did not decree the spittle</b> found <b>in Jerusalem</b> to be ritually impure? If so, why is the spittle found in the upper marketplace ritually impure? The Gemara answers: <b>But wasn’t it stated with regard to</b> that marketplace that <b>Rabbi Avin</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: A fortress of gentiles was there,</b> and since the Sages decreed that gentiles have the ritual impurity of a <i>zav</i>, any spittle found there must be from them and therefore is ritually impure. The mishna also states Rabbi Yosei’s opinion that for most of the year, all spittle found in the middle of the street was impure and spittle found on the sides was pure; during the pilgrim Festival, the spittle in the middle was pure and that on the sides was impure. The Gemara discusses a <i>baraita</i> that explains this opinion: <b>On the rest of the days of the year, the ritually impure proceed</b> down the middle of the street <b>in a group, and the pure proceed on the side</b> to avoid contact that would render them impure. <b>And the ritually pure proceed ordinarily</b> and don’t warn the ritually impure not to touch them, while the <b>impure</b> are the ones who <b>say to</b> those who are ritually pure: <b>Stay away.

The Gemara asks: <b>Didn’t Rabbi Abbahu say this in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> The Sages <b>did not decree</b> ritual impurity <b>with regard to the vessels</b> found in <b>Jerusalem?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Since they were found on the way down to the bathhouse, it becomes</b> as if it had been conclusively <b>demonstrated</b> that they are ritually impure, for one does not bring a vessel to be immersed if it is not ritually impure.",
                " The mishna also states that Rabbi Yosei is of the opinion that all vessels that are found in Jerusalem are ritually pure, except for the basket, the shovel, and the <i>meritza</i>, which are specifically used for graves. The Gemara recounts that <b>Abba Shaul,</b> who was a gravedigger and regularly used such tools, <b>would call them,</b> the tools referred to by the name <i>meritza</i>, <b>fingernails</b> [<b><i>tzipporin</i></b>]. The Gemara explains: <b>The one who said</b> to call it <b><i>tzipporin</i></b> did so because this tool <b>was similar</b> in appearance to a <b>fingernail,</b> with a sharp point. <b>The one who said</b> to call it a <b><i>meritza</i>,</b> literally, a runner, did so because it is a tool with which <b>one runs,</b> i.e., moves <b>the stone</b> used to close the entrance to the burial cave <b>to the cemetery.</b>",
                " The mishna also states that if the <b>cleaver</b> is found tied to a knife, it has the same rule as the knife with regard to ritual impurity. The Gemara quotes: <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that disagrees with the <i>halakha</i> in the mishna, and in its view, if <b>the knife were tied to</b> the cleaver, <b>it has the same</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>as</b> the cleaver, and if the cleaver is ritually impure, the knife is also ritually impure."

Rather, <b>it is immersed inside</b> the Temple. <b>And</b> if it were removed to outside the courtyard in order to immerse it, <b>it</b> can <b>be brought</b> back into the courtyard <b>immediately.</b> Since it is ritually impure only by rabbinic law, there is no need to wait until sunset before returning it. But <b>if it became impure from a primary source of impurity,</b> e.g., it came into contact with the carcass of one of the eight creeping animals that confer impurity by Torah law, <b>it is immersed outside</b> the courtyard <b>and is spread out</b> to dry <b>on the rampart.</b> This is the low wall surrounding the Temple courtyard and the buildings within it, which has a lower level of holiness than the courtyard. The reason for this policy is <b>because the sun needs to set on it.</b> Immersion does not confer ritual purity on an item that became impure by Torah law until after the sun has set.

                "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The opinions in the mishna, with the exception of that of Rabbi Akiva, distinguish between impurity conferred by a primary source and that conferred by a secondary source. The Gemara presents a dispute as to the nature of this distinction. <b>Bar Kappara said: The primary source of ritual impurity</b> mentioned in the mishna is referring to a scenario where the flesh of the offering became impure by <b>Torah law,</b> and <b>the secondary source of ritual impurity</b> mentioned in the mishna is referring to impurity <b>by</b> rabbinic <b>ordinance.

Accordingly, why distinguish between them with regard to where the flesh must be burned? The Gemara answers: The reason that Beit Shammai distinguish between impurity that occurred inside the Temple courtyard and that which occurred outside is <b>because</b> they accepted the reasoning of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> who <b>said</b> in the mishna: <b>The place of its impurity is where its burning should occur.</b> Beit Shammai, however, do not completely agree with Rabbi Akiva. With regard to items that became impure by Torah law, their opinion is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, meaning that the items should be burned wherever they are. However, if an item became impure by rabbinic ordinance, Beit Shammai maintain, against the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, that it is brought into the courtyard to be burned. The Gemara continues to question the opinion of bar Kappara: <b>And is this not difficult even according to</b> the opinion <b>of Beit Hillel?</b> As the mishna stated <b>that Beit Hillel said: It all should be burned outside</b> the courtyard of the Temple, <b>except for that which became ritually impure by a secondary source of impurity inside.</b> According to bar Kappara <b>what is between,</b> why is there a distinction, with regard to flesh that became impure by a <b>secondary source of impurity between whether</b> it occurred <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard <b>or inside? Aren’t</b> both <b>this and that</b> instances where the impurity <b>is by rabbinic ordinance?</b> The Gemara answers: Beit Hillel distinguish between impurity that occurred inside the Temple courtyard and impurity that occurred outside <b>due to that</b> which <b>Rabbi Shimon said: The food and drink of a leper is banished from all three</b> of the <b>camps</b> in which the Children of Israel lived in the desert. These are the camp of the Divine Presence, i.e., the Tabernacle; the camp of the Levites, who were encamped around the Tabernacle; and the camp of Israel, where the rest of the nation lived. Once food and drink has become impure through contact with a leper, it is banned from all three camps, like the leper himself. If it became impure outside the camps, it should not be brought inside. Beit Hillel follow the same rationale, that an item rendered impure outside, even if by rabbinic ordinance, may not be brought into the Temple even for the purpose of burning it."

The Gemara points out: Even according to Rabbi Shimon, <b>this</b> indicates that <b>shekels would be consecrated</b> if one did so in the present day. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda in the name of Rabbi Shimon</b> says, contrary to this implication: <b>Both these,</b> first fruits, <b>and those,</b> shekels, <b>are not consecrated.</b> The Gemara continues with a discussion of consecrated items in the present day, in the absence of the Temple. <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A <b>convert</b> who converts <b>in the present day is obligated to set aside,</b> in lieu of <b>his pair</b> of doves, <b>a quarter-</b>dinar <b>of silver,</b> for that is the cheapest price at which one can purchase them. A convert at the time of the Temple was obligated to offer two doves or pigeons as the conclusion of the conversion process. <b>Rabbi Shimon said: Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Zakkai voided</b> that obligation <b>due to the</b> potential for a <b>mishap,</b> since that money would be consecrated and there is a high risk that it would be misused. <b>What</b> is meant by: <b>Due to the</b> potential for a <b>mishap?</b> Where can it be seen that the Sages were concerned about the possibility of such mishaps? <b>Like that</b> which <b>was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not consecrate</b> an item, <b>or take a valuation vow,</b> i.e., vow that one’s value is dedicated to the Temple, <b>or consecrate</b> objects for use by the priests or the Temple, <b>or separate <i>terumot</i></b> or <b>tithes in the present day</b> when there is no Temple, lest there be a mishap and one derive prohibited benefit from any of those items. <b>And if</b> he violated this rule, and <b>consecrated</b> an item, <b>or took a valuation vow, or consecrated</b> an object for use by the priests or the Temple, <b>or separated</b> <i>terumot</i> or tithes, <b>the clothing</b> that was consecrated <b>is burnt, the animal is destroyed. How</b> is it destroyed? The door of its stall is locked <b>in front of it and it dies by itself,</b> of hunger, as it is prohibited to actively destroy consecrated items. <b>And the money</b> that was consecrated <b>goes to the Dead Sea,</b> i.e., is abandoned where no one will ever find it. Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Zakkai voided the convert’s obligation to set aside money for a pair of doves. The Gemara asks: If the convert <b>transgressed</b> and ignored the instructions of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Zakkai <b>and consecrated</b> money for a pair of doves, is it effective? The answer to this question can be inferred <b>from that which Rabbi Shimon said</b> in that same <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Zakkai voided</b> that obligation <b>due to the</b> potential for a <b>mishap. That is to say,</b> from the fact that the potential for a mishap exists, one can infer that if one <b>transgressed and consecrated</b> the money, <b>it is</b> nevertheless <b>consecrated.</b> <b>Rabbi Yodeh Antodarya asked in the presence of Rabbi Yosei: Here</b> in the <i>baraita</i> <b>you</b> <sup><b>[22b]</b></sup> <b>say</b> that the money <b>has been consecrated; and here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> mentioned before, <b>you say</b> that Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon that if one consecrates shekels in the present day, they <b>are not consecrated.</b> He <b>said to</b> him: <b>There,</b> regarding the shekels, <b>one does not consecrate <i>ab initio</i> because the mitzva</b> is <b>to bring</b> the communal <b>offerings</b> each year <b>from</b> the <b>new collection</b> of half-shekels, those collected for that year, <b>and these</b> shekels, those consecrated in the present day, will necessarily be from the <b>old</b> collection, whenever the Temple is rebuilt, and as such have no use. For this reason, even if he consecrated shekels, they remain non-sacred. <b>And here,</b> however, with regard to the convert’s money set aside for his pair of doves, <b>what have you to say?</b> In what sense is <b>this</b> consecrated money <b>old?</b> The disqualification of the old collection only applies to shekels used to purchase communal offerings, <b>and other</b> private <b>consecrated items and a convert’s pair</b> of doves do <b>not need</b> to be purchased from a <b>new</b> collection. Money consecrated now can be used to acquire a convert’s pair of doves. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>if</b> he went ahead and <b>consecrated</b> a quarter-dinar of silver in order to acquire a pair of doves, it is <b>consecrated,</b> and he <b>should set it aside</b> until the Temple is rebuilt. According to Rabbi Yosei’s reasoning, the shekels are not consecrated because they have no use, as long as the Temple is not rebuilt this year. The Gemara asks: Why are they not consecrated? <b>Perhaps</b> the <b>Temple will</b> be <b>rebuilt</b> again <b>as at first, and the collection of the</b> Temple Treasury <b>chamber will be collected from the new</b> collection <b>in its</b> proper <b>time on the first of Nisan.</b> If that comes to pass, his shekels will be from the current year, and their consecration would have a point. <b>And here</b> too, <b>what have you</b> to say? What are the grounds for a distinction between the convert’s offering whose illicit consecration is effective and the shekels whose illicit consecration is ineffective? The Gemara does not offer an answer. Apropos the dispute in the mishna about someone who went ahead and consecrated first fruits in the present day, <b>Rav Hamnuna and Rav Adda bar Ahava</b> said <b>in the name of Rav: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> that they are not consecrated."
