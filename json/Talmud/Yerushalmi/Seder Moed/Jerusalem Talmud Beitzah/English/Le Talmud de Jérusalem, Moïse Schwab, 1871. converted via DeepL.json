                "It has been said elsewhere: the egg from a carrion is of permitted use when similar ones are sold in the market; otherwise it is forbidden, according to the opinion of Shammai; Hillel forbids it in any case. What is the reason of the House of Shammai? Shammai allows it because he assumes that the egg was matured before the defect occurred in the animal.<br>If this is so, why should the permission depend on the suitability of the egg for sale in the market? If this is not the case, one would be allowed to eat even the egg that is still attached to the ovary (an integral part of the carrion and forbidden).<br>Is it true that Shammai conforms to the latter Mishna and Hillel to the former?"
