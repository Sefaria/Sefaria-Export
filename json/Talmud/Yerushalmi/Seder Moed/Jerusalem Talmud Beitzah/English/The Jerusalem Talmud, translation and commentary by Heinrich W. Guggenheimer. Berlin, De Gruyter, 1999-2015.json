The House of Shammai hold that an entire chicken is food since slaughter for food is permitted on the holiday, and since everybody agrees that an egg found inside a slaughtered chicken on a holiday is permitted food, there is no reason to consider a laid egg as something different.</i>, but the House of Hillel say that it may not be eaten<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The House of Hillel consider the laid egg as a new entity which did not exist before the holiday and which therefore is <i>muqṣeh</i> and may not be moved.</i>.",
                "<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “An egg was laid on a holiday,” etc. What is the reason of the House of Shammai? It is prepared in its mother’s body<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since a chicken may be slaughtered as food on a holiday, it was available all the time and therefore its eggs should not be treated differently.<br>For most of Chapter 1 there exist one or two parallel Genizah fragments edited by L. Ginzberg in his <i>Yerushalmi Fragments</i>, pp. 154–172, noted G and <b>G</b>, 302–303 (G).</i>. What is the reason of the House of Hillel? It is like <i>muqṣeh</i> which dried without him realizing it<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">While <i>muqṣeh</i> is the technical term for anything which is not available to be moved on the holiday or Sabbath, the original meaning is “cut-up”, <i>viz</i>., a heap of cut-up figs lying on the flat roof to ferment and to be made into fig cakes. During the fermentation process the mass is inedible; therefore it has become the paradigm of anything not currently available for use. Here the original meaning is intended. If the owner had inspected his roof on the eve of the holiday he would have realized that the figs were ready food for the holiday and therefore falling under the category of “prepared food” permitted on Sabbath and holiday. But since at sundown of the holiday he had no knowledge of the situation, the figs were not available to him at the start of the holiday and therefore remain forbidden for the rest of the holiday. Similarly, since the owner of the chicken does not know that the egg (which is completely formed with its hard shell) will be laid on the holiday, since it was not available at the start it cannot become available later.</i>, and is <i>muqṣeh</i> which dried without him realizing it not forbidden? But was it not stated<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Tosefta Beitzah (Lieberman) 1:2\" href=\"/Tosefta_Beitzah_(Lieberman).1.2\">Tosephta 1:2</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Beitzah 2b\" href=\"/Beitzah.2b\">Babli 2b</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Beitzah 6b\" href=\"/Beitzah.6b\">6b</a>.</i>, “if one slaughters a chicken and found eggs inside it, even if they are complete<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">With shell.</i> they are permitted”? Rebbi Ḥananiah and Rebbi Mana. One said, its taste when eaten from its inside is not comparable to its taste when eaten from the outside. But the other said, it is not completed for a chick<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It cannot be used for hatching a new chick. The Yerushalmi presumes that every egg potentially is either food or material for hatching, disputed by the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Beitzah 2a\" href=\"/Beitzah.2a\">Babli, 2a</a>.</i> until it comes outside. What are they with milk<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Meat is forbidden to be used with milk. A laid egg may be used with either milk or meat. What is the status of a complete egg found inside a slaughtered chicken?</i>? Let us say, if they are connected to blood vessels they are forbidden, otherwise permitted<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Beitzah 6b\" href=\"/Beitzah.6b\">Babli 6b</a>.</i>.",
                "“Everybody agrees that an egg of which a major part was laid before the start of the holiday may be eaten on the holiday<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Tosefta Beitzah (Lieberman) 1:3\" href=\"/Tosefta_Beitzah_(Lieberman).1.3\">Tosephta 1:3</a>; in one version in the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Beitzah 7a\" href=\"/Beitzah.7a\">Babli 7a</a> (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Bekhorot 8a\" href=\"/Bekhorot.8a\"><i>Bekhorot</i> 8a</a>) this holds true even if the egg in the meantime had again disappeared into the body of the chicken.</i>”. Where do they disagree? If a minor part came out, where the House of Shammai say that it may be eaten, but the House of Hillel say that it may not be eaten<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a logical consequence of the preceding statement. Since we consider an egg of which more than half is visible as completely laid, an egg of which less that half is visible is not laid at all and therefore is an egg totally laid on the holiday and not food available earlier.</i>. “<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Tosefta Beitzah (Lieberman) 1:3\" href=\"/Tosefta_Beitzah_(Lieberman).1.3\">Tosephta 1:3</a>; <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Beitzah 3b\" href=\"/Beitzah.3b\">Babli 3b</a>,<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Beitzah 4a\" href=\"/Beitzah.4a\">4a</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Shabbat 43a\" href=\"/Shabbat.43a\"><i>Šabbat</i> 43a</a>. On the holiday (and Sabbath) one may move only things which may be used on the day (except if one needs the place occupied by an unusable implement, when one may clear the place.) Since the egg is neither food nor a usable implement, it cannot be moved.</i> Just as it is forbidden as food so it is forbidden to be moved. If one was mixed with a hundred or a thousand, they are all forbidden<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In general, if prohibited material is a small minority in permitted material, it may be disregarded. For example, passive non-kosher ingredients in food may be disregarded if they constitute less than 1/60 of the permitted food. But if the prohibition either will disappear by itself (as in the case of an egg laid on the holiday which is permitted food on the next day) or may be removed by some action, no such disregard is permitted; the entire mixture is prohibited until the prohibition disappears.</i>”. How? Following him who said, if the preparation is in doubt it is forbidden; but him who said, if the preparation is in doubt it is permitted, here he agrees that it is forbidden. For wind-fall there is a doubt where it fell today or fell yesterday, but here one is forbidden and it is proof for all of them<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If fruit is found under a fruit tree on the holiday, there is a doubt whether it is forbidden as fallen on the holiday or whether it is permitted as fallen before the holiday. Therefore if this fruit is put into a basket with many other fruits, there is a doubt whether any of this is forbidden. If we hold that the requirement to use only food available before the holiday is biblical (cf. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 16:23\" href=\"/Exodus.16.23\"><i>Ex.</i> 16:23</a>) the wind-fall is forbidden, but if the requirement is rabbinic and traditional, the wind-fall is permitted cf. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Beitzah 24a\" href=\"/Beitzah.24a\">Babli 24a</a>. There is nothing clearly forbidden and the rule spelled out at the end of the preceding note cannot be applied. But if an egg was laid on the holiday, for the House of Hillel it certainly is forbidden and therefore the rule which forbids the mixture for the day can be applied.</i>.",

And even if the House of Shammai would argue like the House of Hillel in the first teaching, an egg is a growth of its body<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This now connects the discussion with the Mishnah here. The problem is to understand the position of the House of Hillel since the preparation of food is permitted on a holiday (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 12:16\" href=\"/Exodus.12.16\"><i>Ex.</i> 12:16</a>). According to the Babli and one opinion in the Yerushalmi the prohibition applies only to eggs laid by chickens raised to produce eggs. Then the mother was not food at the start of the holiday. While the egg is food according to everybody, for the House of Hillel it cannot change its character from non-food to food on the holiday. Then the question is raised why milk which is prohibited as food before being ingested by a ruminant becomes permitted by the animal’s stomach. In this question, the revised ruling in matters of rennet would agree with the stance of the House of Shammai. But the answer is that the two cases cannot be compared; the stomach contents of an animal never were part of the animal and do not have the latter’s status.</i>; the contents of the stomach come from the outside. It parallels what Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: It happened to the sons of Jehudah ben Shamuai that wolves tore more than 300 of their flock. The case came before the Sages who permitted their stomach contents<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">T he latter teaching which permits rennet from animals prohibited as meat is confirmed by a ruling in an actual case.</i>. They said, an egg is a growth of its body; the contents of the stomach come from the outside.",

According to R. Eliezer, the House of Hillel hold that the prohibition of newly available food on Sabbath and holiday is biblical; therefore since the egg was unavailable one moment before the start of the Sabbath it is unavailable on the Sabbath. For the anonymous majority and the House of Shammai the prohibition is rabbinical; since holiday and Sabbath represent two different kinds of holiness, the prohibition on one day has no influence on the other day.</i>.” Rebbi Ḥanina instructed the Sepphoreans about spontaneous growth of mustard<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the Sabbatical year, as exception to R.

Rebbi Abba bar Zemina in the name of Rebbi Joṣadaq: Because of these two things did Rebbi Joḥanan descend from Sepphoris to Tiberias.

Since by biblical standards the sacrifice cannot be brought without being leaned on, they require the leaning being done before the holiday (after the dedication of the animal as sacrifice and in the Temple precinct.) They do not permit elevation offerings on the holiday itself since it is completely burned and does not represent food.

The House of Shammai said to them, vows and voluntary gifts are proof, since they are permitted to the private person but forbidden to Heaven. The House of Hillel said to them, no. If you are speaking about vows and voluntary gifts which have no fixed time, what does this imply for the festival offering which has a fixed time? The House of Shammai answered them, the festival offering has no fixed time since if he did not offer it on the first day, he may offer it on the second day, if he did not offer it on the second day, he may offer it on the third day. The House of Hillel told them, the festival offering has a fixed time, for if he did not offer it on the holiday of pilgrimage he may not offer it after the holiday.

Abba Shaul says it was based on another reason: Since when your stove is closed down, your Master’s stove is open, when your stove is open it only is logical that your Master’s stove should be open. Another explanation: It is not in order that your table should be full but the table of your Creator be empty.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">64</sup><i class=\"footnote\">While there are two disputes between the Houses of Hillel and Shammai, about leaning on animals and about bringing elevation offerings on a holiday proper, it is clear that once it is decided that elevation offerings can be brought with the required leaning-on, well-being offerings also may be brought with all required ceremonies. Therefore the argument reduces to one about the possibility of offering private elevation offerings on a full holiday. The first argument of the House of Hillel is that on the Sabbath, when all cooking or other use of fire is forbidden to humans, the Temple altar is in full action, burning two daily and two <i>musaf</i> offerings. Therefore on a holiday when cooking is permitted, it must be possible for private persons to offer sacrifices to be burned on the altar. The argument is refuted by the House of Shammai since it is agreed that sacrifices not brought as festival offerings but in fulfillment of a vow (either as “vow”, i. e., a promise of <i>an</i> animal, or as “voluntary offering”, a promise of <i>this</i> animal) cannot be brought on the full holiday but only on the intermediate days (or for Pentecost, the week following.) The House of Hillel then point out that vows may be brought any time during the year, it only is a convenience to bring them when one has to visit the Temple anyhow; but festival offerings which are tied to the festival must be brought on the festival. The House of Shammai answer that the festival offerings may be brought on the intermediate days (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Chagigah 1:6:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Chagigah.1.6.1\">Mishnah <i>Ḥagigah</i> 1:6</a>), when all work is permitted; but the House of Hillel retort that still after the end of the holiday period there is no possibility of making up for a missed holiday sacrifice. The inconclusive discussion is cut short by Abba Shaul and the “other explanation”, that the position of the House of Shammai leads to the Temple being empty of people on full holidays, crowded on the intermediate days, whereas Pentateuch, Prophets, and Psalms all indicate that the essence of a holiday of pilgrimage is that the Temple precinct be filled to capacity, and that therefore practice must follow the House of Hillel, as explained in the last paragraph of the Halakhah.</i>”",
