            "Initially there was no dispute in Israel except regarding semicha [laying on of hands to an animal about to be sacrificed]. Hillel and Shammai made them four [disputes]. When the disciples of Shammai and Hillel became numerous, and did not attend to their masters as much as necessary, and disputes multiplied in Israel they divided into two groups, one declaring things impure and the other declaring them pure.  And this shall never return to its proper place until the arrival of the son of David. [i.e., the Messiah]."

            "A story [with legal significance] is told of Hillel the Elder, who brought his [animal for a] burnt offering to the Temple and performed semicha upon it. Students of Beit Shammai gathered around him so he began swaying the animal's tail back and forth and said to them \"look, it is a female and brought as a shelamim sacrifice!\" He distracted them with words, and they went away. After several days, Beit Shammai gained the upper hand and wished to establish the law [of semicha] in accordance with their view, but there was one among them named Bava ben Butah, who was of the students of Beit Shammai, and he knew the law was in accordance with Beit Hillel. One time he entered the Temple courtyard [on yom tov] and saw it was desolate. He said \"Both these houses should be come desolate for they have caused the House of Our Lord to become desolate.\" What did he do? He sent for and brought 3,000 sheep of Kedar and checked [to ensure they had no] blemishes, and he stood them in the Temple courtyard and said: \"Listen my brothers, O House of Israel!Anyone who wishes to bring a burnt offering and place his hands on the head of an animal should come and place his hands there. And any who wish to bring a peace offering and perform semicha may do so. And on that day they established the halakha in this case in accordance with the opnion of Beit Hillel and no man said a word."

            "Mishna. The dues collectors who entered the house and the [thieves] (collectors) who returned the vessels are trustworthy to say that they did not touch anything, and in Jerusalem they are trustworthy regarding holy vessels. And at the time of the festivals even regarding priestly offerings. ", 
            "Gemara. The dues collectors who entered into a house – it is impure. If there is a non-Jew with them they are trustworthy to say ‘we went in but touched nothing.’ Give this two explanations. They are trustworthy to say ‘we entered but touched nothing’ when there are witnesses and they know this. And in Jerusalem they are trustworthy regarding holy vessels even when there are witnesses which they know about. Another explanation – they are trustworthy to say ‘we entered but touched nothing’ therefore we need the other teaching when there are witnesses they know about. And in Jerusalem they are trustworthy even on holy vessels even though there are witnesses that they know about. R’ Yehoshua ben Levi said: “The built-up Jerusalem is like a city that was joined (chubra) together within itself.” (Psalms 122:3) A city which makes all of Israel friends (chaverim – also a term for those who are trustworthy regarding tithes and matters of ritual purity). If so, let this be true during the rest of the year. R’ Zeira said: only at the time “There ascended the tribes…” (Psalms 122:4)"
