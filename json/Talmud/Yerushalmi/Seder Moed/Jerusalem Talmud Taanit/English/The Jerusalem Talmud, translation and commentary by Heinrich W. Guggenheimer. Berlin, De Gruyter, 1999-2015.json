Rebbi Eliezer says, from the first holiday of Tabernacles, but Rebbi Joshua says, from the concluding holiday<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The last holiday is the eighth day of Tabernacles which follows the seven days of dwelling in huts when one returns to dwell in houses.</i>. Rebbi Joshua said, since rain during Tabernacles is not a sign<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Greek σημεῑον.</i> of blessing<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This also is Maimonides’s version. In the Babli “a sign of curse”, since rain (in Israel) during Tabernacles is a sign that Heaven is not interested in the Jews sitting in huts.</i>, why should he mention? Rebbi Eliezer said to him, he only says “He Who makes the wind blow and brings down the rain”, in its appropriate time.

Another explanation, when the slave serves all his master’s needs he asks for his reward from him. Rebbi Joshua said to him, is it not that when the slave has served all his master’s needs and his master is satisfied with him<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In this case, by showing through the absence of rain that the service of the Jews is agreeable to Heaven.</i> that he asks his [sustenance]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Corrector’s text, overwriting the scribe’s which probably was פרס, “reward”.</i> from him?

The argument of Rebbi Joshua is inverted. There, he says from the concluding holiday, but here he says, from the time he puts it down<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the Mishnah he designates the eighth day of Tabernacles; his opinion in the <i>baraita</i> can be read as meaning that on the seventh day after morning prayers, when the <i>lulav</i> is no longer needed, one should start mentioning rain in his prayers.</i>. Rebbi Mana says, because the entire day is qualified to take the <i>lulav</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">While weaving the <i>lulav</i> during morning prayers is preferred, the obligation can be discharged during the entire day. As a generally applicable rule, R. Joshua’s statement in the <i>baraita</i> also refers to the eighth day.</i>. Should he not mention in the evening<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the first prayer on the eighth day is the evening prayer, there seems to be no reason for R. Joshua to wait until the second prayer in the morning, which is the third after the start of the day.</i>? Not everybody is there. Then he should mention it in the morning. He would think that maybe they mentioned in the evening and he will mention. Since he sees that they do not mention in the first {prayer} but mention in the later {prayer}, he understands that they did not mention in the evening<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For R. Joshua it would have been better to start mentioning rain in the evening prayer but this turns out to be not practicable.</i>.

The text here is almost identical with <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Tosefta Taanit (Lieberman) 1:4\" href=\"/Tosefta_Taanit_(Lieberman).1.4\">Tosephta 1:4</a>.

Yehudah says that for dry earth, one handb̮readth was enough, for average ground two handb̮readths, and for well worked ground, three handb̮readths. If these are two equivalent formulations, then the text here has to be interpreted in the light of the text in Babli/Midrash: Not that R. Meïr requires a rainfall of three handb̮readths (10.8 inches) in one storm (or R. Yehudah rainfalls of 3.6, 7.2, 10.8 inches, respectively) but that the moisture has to penetrate the earth to the depth indicated. In that case, “dry earth” is simply the earth after the rainless summer months, average earth is the earth after the first winter storms, and well worked ground is the earth after an uninterrupted rain of seven days (the first, second, and third fertilizing periods in the language of Tosephta Taaniot 1:4). R. Simeon ben Eleazar seems to object to both R. Meïr and R. Yehudah because rain will make the ground water level rise by twice the amount of rain water; hence, moisture in the ground can come from below as well as from above. One must assume that in the Yerushalmi also the measurements are those of moist spots in the earth and not of rainfall in the modern sense.</i>?

Rebbi Isaac (bar) &lt;ben rebbi&gt; Eleazar objected before Rebbi Yose: Because you say after their seals, one does not say a verse as benediction<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">126</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the two statements appear together in one <i>baraita</i>, there should be a logical connection between them but there seems to be none.</i>? They said, (that young man is intelligent,) [so is the matter] because he thinks what is the meaning of “after their seals”? It is that when he was standing in the morning prayer and mentioned the text of evening prayers but he caught himself and finished with the text of morning prayers, then he did his duty<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">127</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“They” are the members of R. Yose’s Academy. They do not disagree with the rule which they state, but they note that the <i>baraita</i> does not deal with it; its correct interpretation is by R. Aḥa.<br>About the rule itself, there is disagreement between the Yerushalmi and the parallel <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Berakhot 12a\" href=\"/Berakhot.12a\">Babli, <i>Berakhot</i>12a</a>, where it is stated: “If in the morning one started with ‘Creator of light’ and ended with ‘Making evenings dark’, he did not do his duty. If in the evening he starts with `He Who makes evenings dark’ and ends with `Creator of light’, he did not do his duty. But if he started with ‘Creator of light’ and ended with ‘Making evenings dark’, he did his duty. The principle is: Everything is determined by the seal.” The Babli asserts that if in evening prayers one started out wrongly with the text appropriate for morning prayers then everything is O.K. if only the final doxology is correct. But the Yerushalmi speaks of one “who is standing in morning prayers and mentioned evening”, i. e., he started out correctly, forgot himself in the middle, and remembered in time to close with the correct text. The principles of prayer texts were instituted by the Men of the Great Assembly. They determined the contents of the prayers but not, in general, their texts. (For the Amidah, a later Mishnah reports that Rebbi Eliezer holds that one who repeats the same text for more than 30 days cannot really be an honest supplicant). The question is whether, in addition to the contents, the Men of the Great Assembly only determined the “seals” (following the Babli) or also the introductory sentences (following this Yerushalmi, but incompatible with the poetic versions of the daily prayers known from Yerushalmi sources from the Cairo Genizah).</i>. Rebbi Aḥa said, all benedictions in the kind of their seals<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">128</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The language is difficult. R. Eleazar Askari in his Commentary to <i>Berakhot</i> explains that Rebbi Aḥa insists that only the “seal” counts and, therefore, the text preceding the “seal” is unimportant; the text of the seal cannot be a verse. R. Shelomo Cirillo and R. Moshe ben Ḥabib in their Commentaries to <i>Berakhot</i> explain, on the contrary, that the seal must fit the text of the benediction just preceding and that this text cannot be a verse. In the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Pesachim 104a\" href=\"/Pesachim.104a\">Babli (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 104a</a>) this principle is spelled out only for Havdalah.</i>.

From what is left of the original Galilean practice it seems clear that the standard text of longer benedictions always ended with a Biblical verse just preceding the “seal”. The text here states that the only acceptable place for a Biblical verse is before the “seal“. Since the Mishnah prescribes benedictions on fast days whose text is a Biblical verse, what is prohibited is using a verse in the final doxology.</i>."

One may at least understand the position of Rebbi Abba that on a fast day for rain which coincides with a day of the New Moon, one recites the usual <i>Musaf</i> with an additional fifth benediction which deals with the fast day, after the fourth for the New Moon. The dissenting opinions of Rebbis Ze`ira and Abba bar Mamal seem to imply that <i>Musaf</i> on a fast day consisted of the introductory and final benedictions that are common to all prayers and the additional benedictions for the fast day, whereas the section on the New Moon, for which <i>Musaf</i> is recited in the first place, is moved from its regular place to an insert in either the 16th or the 17th (“thanksgiving”) benediction.</i>.
