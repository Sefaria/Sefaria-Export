                " On every evil which does not come upon the community, they keen, except for an [over-]abundance of rains. A happening: They said to Honi the Circler: \"Pray that the rains will fall;\" he said to them \"go and gather the pesah ovens so that they will not dissolve,\" and he prayed, but the rains did not fall. He circled a circle and stood with in it and said \"O master of the world, your children placed their faith in me, for I am as a son of your house, and I swear by Your name that I will not move from here until you have mercy on your children\" Soft rain began to fall, and he said \"Not for this did I ask, rather for well-rains and ditch-rains and cave-rains!\" [The rains] began to fall in tumult. He said, \"Not for this did I ask, rather for rains of purpose and blessing and generosity. [The rains] fell according to his prescriptions until all Israel were driven up from Jerusalem to the Temple Mount before the rains. They said to him, \"As you prayed for them to fall, now pray for them to go.\" He said to them, \"go and see if the Stone of Errors is erased.\""
