                "<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> There are two [kinds] of transport on the Sabbath which are four [kinds] inside, and two [kinds] which are four [kinds] outside<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On the Sabbath it is forbidden to move any load from a private to the public domain (or for a distance of at least 4 cubits in the public domain.) Inside a private domain there are no restrictions unless the article may not be moved at all. While any transport between domains is forbidden, it is a prosecutable offense only if there is a completed action, i. e., one person lifted the item up, transported it, and put it down. This applies both to transport from the private domain to the public one (“inside”) and <i>vice versa</i> (“outside”). In each case, the transport may be effectuated either by the person inside or the person outside (in which case the person is prosecutable but the person standing in the other domain is not involved) or it may be taken up by one person, taken over while moving by another person who then puts it down. In this case both participants have sinned but are not prosecutable. The possible cases are enumerated in Mishnaiot 1–4. “Liable” and “not liable” refer both to the possibility of prosecution for intentional Sabbath desecration and the obligation of a purification sacrifice in the case of unintentional infraction.</i>. How is this? The poor man stands outside and the householder inside. If the poor man stretched out his hand inside and delivered into the householder’s hand or took something from it and brought it outside, the poor man is liable but the householder is not liable.<br>If the householder stretched out his hand outside and delivered into the poor man’s hand or took something from it and brought it inside, the householder is liable but the poor man is not liable.<br>If the poor man stretched out his hand inside and the householder took from it or gave into it and he then took it out, neither is liable.<br>If the householder stretched out his hand outside and the poor man took from it or gave into it and he then took it in, neither is liable.",
                "<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For this and the following paragraphs there exists a reasonably complete Genizah text (G) edited by L. Ginzberg (שרידי ירושלמי New York 1909 p. 62). A slightly garbled parallel is in <i>Ševuot</i> 1:1, explained there in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Shabbat 1:3:1-10:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shabbat.1.3.1-10.1\">Notes 5–20</a>. The Notes here are restricted to references and short explanations.</i>“Export on the Sabbath,” etc. What means “two which are four”? Two which are four for liability and two which are four for no liability, or four for liability and four for no liability? Let us hear from the following<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishnah <i>Ševuot</i> 1:1.</i>: “There are two kinds of oaths which are four kinds.” Rebbi Abba said, there all are about liability, but here we come to state both liability and no liability<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For R. Abba, there is a difference between the Mishnaiot in <i>Šabbat</i> and <i>Ševuot</i> in that in the case here at least one person involved always is not liable whereas in <i>Ševuot</i> only one person is mentioned and all cases are of liability. For R. Yose, the parallel is only that of Mishnaiot 1–2, not 3–4. Each Mishnah describes two cases of liability; these are two covering in all four cases of liability as in <i>Ševuot</i> 1:1.</i>. This implies four of liability and four of no liability. Rebbi Yose said, the Mishnah says so, “there are two kinds of oaths which are four kinds,” not because of liability? And similarly, “there are two kinds of export on the Sabbath which are four kinds,” because there is liability. But was it not stated<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Mishnah Middot 4:1\" href=\"/Mishnah_Middot.4.1\">Mishnah <i>Middot</i> 4:1</a>. The Mishnah is purely descriptive of the construction of Herod’s Temple; the notions of liability or no liability are inappropriate.</i>, “the doors of the Temple hall were two which are four?” Can you say, liability and no liability? Should we state twelve cases of no liability<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There are four cases in the Mishnah where one party is liable and the other is not involved. Then there are four cases in which both parties are involved but nobody is criminally liable. One might construct another four cases where nobody is liable; e. g., if the poor man reaches into the house, picks something up, which the householder then takes from his hand and deposits outside.</i>? We only come to state cases of no liability which correspond to cases of liability. Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said, what is this “no liability” which we stated here? Permitted<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since in Mishnaiot 1–2 only one person acts, it is inappropriate to apply the label “not liable” to the other person. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Shabbat 2b-3a\" href=\"/Shabbat.2b-3a\">Babli 2b/3a</a>.</i>! Rebbi Yose said, the poor man and the rich man are one but the Sages counted them as two. Bringing in or taking out are one but the Sages counted them as two<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In G, <i>Ševuot</i> 1:1, <i>editio princeps,</i> and a quote in RITBA <i>Ševuot</i> 1:1: “Taking out or bringing in are two but the Sages counted them as one.” As noted later in this paragraph, taking out is called work by Jeremiah (which cannot be used as a legal text but is confirmation of the interpretation of the law) whereas bringing in is only forbidden by the argument that taking out from A to B is bringing in to B from A.</i>. Taking out on the Sabbath does not include bringing in; if one exports from one domain to the other, does this not include the one who imports? Let us hear from the following, as Rebbi Yasa said in the name if Rebbi Joḥanan: Somebody who brings in half the size of a dried fig and takes out half the size of a dried fig is liable<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even an intrinsic liability can be prosecuted only if a minimal amount was transported, which for food is determined as the size of a dried fig (Chapters 7–8). Since taking out and bringing in small quantities are to be combined, taking out and bringing in are representatives of one and the same action, <i>viz.,</i> transporting.</i>. And from where that taking out is called work? Rebbi Samuel bar Naḥman in the name of Rebbi Jonathan<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Ševuot</i> 1:1 and the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Shabbat 6b\" href=\"/Shabbat.6b\">Babli (6b</a>): R.

Just as the people refrained from taking objects out of their houses to give to the collectors so the collectors did not accept anything from them to bring into the office. Rebbi Ḥizqiah in the name of Rebbi Aḥa understood everything from the following<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jeremiah 17:22\" href=\"/Jeremiah.17.22\"><i>Jer.</i> 17:22</a>.</i>: <i>do not bring out any load from your houses on the Sabbath day, and perform no work.</i>",
                "<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For this and the next paragraph there also exists an additional Genizah text (<b>ג</b>) also edited by L. Ginzberg, <i>loc. cit.</i> p. 64.</i> Rebbi Yasa in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: If one brought in half a dried fig and took out half a dried fig he is liable<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here and in the following, “liable” only refers to the obligation to bring a purification sacrifice in case of unintentional infraction of the Sabbath rules. Since an intentional sin cannot be atoned for by a sacrifice (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Numbers 16:30\" href=\"/Numbers.16.30\"><i>Num.</i> 16:30</a>), a sacrifice is possible only if the perpetrator was oblivious either of the fact that the act was forbidden or, in the case of the Sabbath, that the day was a Sabbath. Sins committed during different periods of oblivion require different sacrifices. In addition, the prohibition of work on the Sabbath is not a single prohibition but, as explained in Chapter 7, a set of 39 different prohibitions, each with different minima of forbidden work which trigger the obligation of a sacrifice. Minimal infractions of different prohibitions do not combine to produce the obligation of a sacrifice. On the other hand, infractions which are subsumed under the same prohibition, even if one is clearly biblically prohibited (אַב מְלָאכָה “a master work” such as transporting <i>from</i> a private to the public domain) and one which is classified by a logical argument as belonging to the same class (תּוֹלְדָה “a derivative”, as transporting <i>to</i> the private domain) do combine to create the obligation of a sacrifice.</i>. What Rebbi Joḥanan said does not follow Rebbi Yose<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Tanna, ben Ḥalafta, the greatest authority of the fourth generation of Tannaim.</i>, as it was stated<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Shabbat 80b\" href=\"/Shabbat.80b\">Babli 80b</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Bava Batra 55b\" href=\"/Bava_Batra.55b\"><i>Bava batra</i> 55b</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Keritot 17a\" href=\"/Keritot.17a\"><i>Keritut</i>17a</a>. The first part is a Tosephta, <i>ed.</i> Liebermann 9:11, <i>ed. princeps</i> 10:7.</i>: “If one took out half a dried fig and again took out half a dried fig during one period of oblivion, he is liable; during different periods of oblivion he is not liable. Rebbi Yose said, during one period of oblivion and one domain he is liable, during one period of oblivion and two domains or during two periods of oblivion and one domain he is not liable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since transporting has three components, lifting in one domain, removing to another, and depositing in the other domain, for R. Yose they cannot be combined unless all three components are the same (within one period of oblivion.)</i>” We find this difficult. If two different transorts do not combine following Rebbi Yose, <i>a fortiori</i> also not bringing in and taking out<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The argument is not convincing since transporting into is a derivative of transporting from. R. Yose still could hold that the actions combine to create liability if the domains involved are the same.</i>? Therefore what Rebbi Joḥanan said could not follow Rebbi Yose.",
                "Rebbi Ila said, not only if two doors open to two public roads<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Greek πλατεῖα (sc., ὁδός) “a wide (road)”, equivalent of Hebrew רְחוֹב.</i> but even if they open to the same public road will Rebbi Yose agree<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since it is assumed that each private house has only one door to the street, there are two different private domains involved; the transgressions do not combine for R. Yose.</i>, for Rebbi Yose compares domains to periods of oblivion in matters of liability<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Different domains from which transport starts or where transport ends are like different periods of oblivion for which no common purification sacrifice is possible by biblical standards.</i>. Just as Rebbi Yose compares domains to periods of oblivion in absence of liability so Rebbi Yose compares domains to periods of oblivion in matters of liability<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Clearly the correct text is that of G: “Just as Rebbi Yose compares domains to periods of oblivion in matters of liability so Rebbi Yose compares domains to periods of oblivion in absence of liability.” The fact that incomplete actions in two different periods of oblivion do not combine to create the liability (or possibility) of a sacrifice is only a corollary to the statement that all infractions of the same kind committed during the same period of oblivion are atoned for by one single sacrifice.</i>. For if he took out the volume of a dried fig through this door and the volume of a dried fig through that door in one period of oblivion is he not liable twice<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For R. Yose, who negates the possibility of any sacrifice if the amounts each time are insufficient. For the anonymous majority, the situation is the opposite; two transports of insufficient quantities from two domains combine to create liability for a sacrifice but transports of greater quantities from different domains in one period of oblivion are atoned for by a single sacrifice.</i>?",
                "<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This paragraph and the next also appear in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Horayot 3:2:12\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Horayot.3.2.12\"><i>Horaiot</i> 3:3 (Notes 66–72</a>) in a different context. (R. Yose mentioned there is the fifth generation Amora).</i> Rebbi Yudan said, Rebbi Yose compares domains to eating slices<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This refers to sacrifices due for eating forbidden food. Since purification sacrifices are due only for transgressions punishable at least by extirpation (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Horayot 3:4:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Horayot.3.4.1\">Mishnah <i>Horaiot</i> 3:7</a>), the only example of such solid food is forbidden fat. A sacrifice for inadvertent consumption of forbidden fat is due if at least the volume of an average olive was eaten in the time needed to eat a slice of bread. The slice is defined (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Tosefta Negaim 7:9-10\" href=\"/Tosefta_Negaim.7.9-10\">Tosephta <i>Negaˋim</i> 7:10</a>) as half a loaf when three loaves are baked from a <i>kav</i> of flour (about 35 cl)</i>. For if one ate the volume of half an olive during the time needed to eat one slice and another volume of half an olive in the time needed to eat another slice, is he not free from liability? If one ate several volumes of olives during several times needed to eat a slice in one period of forgetting, he is liable only once.",
                "<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Horayot 3:2:12\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Horayot.3.2.12\"><i>Horaiot</i> 3:3 Note 70</a>. The rabbis of Caesarea object to comparing the rules of the Sabbath to any other biblical prohibition. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Shabbat 13:1:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shabbat.13.1.1\">Mishnah 13:1</a> states that weaving is forbidden and the threshold for an action requiring a purification sacrifice is weaving two threads. For the majority, weaving two threads in one oblivion triggers the obligation of a sacrifice, for R. Yose only if the two rows were added to the same piece of cloth.</i> The rabbis of Caesarea say, before you compare this to fat, compare it to the rules of Sabbath itself. For if one was weaving one thread on this piece of cloth and weaving one thread on that piece of cloth, is he not free from liability? If he wove several threads on several pieces of cloth in one period of oblivion he is liable only once.",
                "Rebbi Yose in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: The one who takes out is not liable until he put it down<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As explained in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Shabbat 1:1:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shabbat.1.1.1\">Note 1</a>, the Sabbath is desecrated only by a complete action, lifting up, transporting from one domain to another, and depositing. If the last act is missing, there was no punishable desecration.<br>The tradent R. Yose is the fifth generation Amora.</i>. Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: Unless he take up and put down. Rebbi Zeˋira required, unless he take it up with the intention to put it down<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a necessary clarification of the preceding statement. Not only must there be a complete action, but all three parts must be executed with the intent to perform the action. In <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 35\" href=\"/Exodus.35\"><i>Ex.</i> 35</a>, the prohibition of work on the Sabbath is repeated (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 35:1-3\" href=\"/Exodus.35.1-3\">vv. 1–3</a>) as part of the commandment to build the Tabernacle (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 35:4-35\" href=\"/Exodus.35.4-35\">vv. 4–35</a>). In 35:33, the construction of the Tabernacle is described as “thinking work”. It is concluded that only “thinking work” is punishable (criminally or by a sacrifice) as desecration of the Sabbath. In the special case of transporting, there is desecration only if the three parts are done with compatible intent, if the lifting up was intended to be followed by a putting down.</i>. Not if he lifted it to eat and then changed his mind to put it down<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is perfectly legitimate to take food to eat in the domain where it was at the start of the Sabbath. If the first stage of a transport was executed in a perfectly permitted way based on a true thought, it never can become the first leg in a criminal transport. While the change of intent and the following action were forbidden and sinful, there can be no criminal or sacrificial liability attached to them. (As statement of R. Joḥanan himself, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Shabbat 5b\" href=\"/Shabbat.5b\">Babli 5b</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Eruvin 20b\" href=\"/Eruvin.20b\"><i>Eruvin</i> 20b</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Ketubot 31a\" href=\"/Ketubot.31a\"><i>Ketubot</i> 31a</a>).</i>. What Rebbi Joḥanan said does not follow Rebbi Yose, as it was stated<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">An anonymous <i>baraita</i> following the statement here attributed to R. Yose is <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Tosefta Shabbat (Lieberman) 9:11\" href=\"/Tosefta_Shabbat_(Lieberman).9.11\">Tosephta 9:11</a>(ed. S. Liebermann); the first part Babli 80a.<br>Since in the public domain one is only permitted to move things by a distance of less than four cubits, things farther away are as in two different domains. If each transport was less that a minimal amount, the actions cannot be combined.</i>: “If he took out half the volume of a dried fig and put it down, and then took out another volume of half a dried fig. If he put it down within four cubits of the first piece he is liable, otherwise he is not liable. Rebbi Yose<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Tanna, ben Ḥalafta, the greatest authority of the fourth generation of Tannaim.</i> said, if he transported it over it, he is liable, otherwise he is not liable.” Rebbi Yose considers the person walking as if he was putting down<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Later in the Halakhah and in the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Shabbat 5b\" href=\"/Shabbat.5b\">Babli (5b</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Shabbat 91b\" href=\"/Shabbat.91b\">91b</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Eruvin 98a\" href=\"/Eruvin.98a\"><i>Eruvin</i> 98a</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Ketubot 31b\" href=\"/Ketubot.31b\"><i>Ketubot</i> 31b</a>) this opinion is attributed to Ben Azzai, a generation before R. Yose. It is agreed by everybody that standing still while transporting an object is legally putting it down, not on the ground but on the static person. This is the same as depositing the object on a pillar. R. Yose holds that a slow motion such as walking is the equivalent of standing still for a negligible time at many places. An action which does not result in instant deposition is throwing.<br>According to R. Yose, if the second object ever was within 4 cubits of the place where the first was deposited, the two actions combine for liability, even if the second was ultimately deposited somewhere else.</i>. Just as Rebbi Yose considers the person walking as if he was putting down for liability so he considers the person walking as if he was putting down for non-liability. When he took it out he is considered having put it down; then he should be free from liability<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If the object is considered deposited the moment it was taken out of a private domain by a walking person, then any subsequent motion is a new transport. Since R. Yose (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Shabbat 1:1:4\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shabbat.1.1.4\">Note 44</a>) only considers combining transports if they originate and terminate in the same domains, the fact that later the second object was transported over the first should be irrelevant.</i>.

Yose they cannot be combined unless all three components are the same (within one period of oblivion.)</i>, “otherwise he is not liable.” Rebbi Abba the son of Rebbi Pappaeus said, explain it if the door was five cubits wide and he brought one out on this side, the other on the other side. Then the second was not taken out within four cubits of the first<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For the anonymous Tanna the final place of deposit determines liability; for R. Yose there is no liability if the two paths never were within 4 cubits of one another.</i>.",

For the illicit use of a <i>sanctum</i> a reparation sacrifice is due (5:15–16). R. Meïr adds that if the day also was a Sabbath and the person would take the piece in a private domain, carry it out and eat it in the public domain, an additional purification offering is needed.<br>The text and R. Yudan’s explanation make it clear that the Yerushalmi does not read with some Babli sources “carried it out in his mouth.”</i>.

Liebermann explains אֵינוֹ הַשֵּׁם as “is not simultaneous.”</i>.” Because this one is liable because of walking and that one is liable because of putting down<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Eating may also be done while walking; the Sabbath infraction becomes a liability only when the motion stopped.</i>.

Yose.</i>! The argument of Rebbi Yose is inverted. There, he does not consider the person walking equal to one who was putting down but here he is considering the person walking equal to one who was putting down<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This argument may support Liebermann’s interpretation.

The general rule is that once there is an obligation to pray, the obligation should be fulfilled before any profane action is taken, in particular if the intended action may be a lengthy one. The problem with afternoon prayers is that it is possible to pray starting half an hour after noon (“the great <i>minḥah</i>”) but the actual obligation starts only an hour and a quarter before sundown (“the small <i>minḥah</i>”). The “hours” mentioned here are variable, one-twelfth of the time between sunrise and sundown. From the Halakhah in the Yerushalmi it is clear that only the small <i>minḥah</i> is taken into account; in the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Shabbat 9b\" href=\"/Shabbat.9b\">Babli (9b</a>) both times are considered.</i>.

Yose (the Amora) states later in the discussion of Mishnah 5 that one interrupts what one is doing for the recitation of the <i>Šemaˋ</i> but not for prayer since the recitation does not need concentration and therefore needs only a short moment whereas prayer requires concentration and a longer interruption. The question raised here is that it is forbidden to recite the <i>Šemaˋ</i> (or quote any verse) at smelly places (cf. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 3:5:2-19\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.3.5.2-19\"><i>Berakhot</i> 3:5</a>). Since tanning of hides produces bad smell, the tanner cannot recite anything unless he remove himself from his place of work and cleanse himself thoroughly, which consumes more time than people usually spend for prayer. Therefore reciting the <i>Šemaˋ</i> for a tanner should follow the rules of prayer and he should not be required to interrupt his work. The answer is that he is required to interrupt only if he already has put on his work clothes but not entered the tannery.

The biblical text does not specify what the status is of the person between immersion and sundown, when he is called <i>ṭevul yom</i> “immersed during daytime”. While he is pure, by rabbinic convention (but following some opinions by biblical decree) he invalidates sanctified food by his touch as if he were impure in the second degree (cf. <i>Sotah</i> 5:2 Notes 42,46,47,68.)</i>, and food and vessels which became impure by fluids<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">299</sup><i class=\"footnote\">While solid food impure in the k-th degree imparts impurity of the (k+l)st degree on what it touches, by rabbinic practice impure fluid always causes impurity of the first degree in what comes in touch with it.

The Genizah text is reasonably complete here (G).</i> Mishnah: “The House of Shammai say, one does set traps for wild animals, or birds, of fish,” etc. Who informs? If the trap was sprung, it is certain that they were caught when it still was day. But if the trap was not sprung, it is certain that they were not caught when it still was day. And even if the trap was sprung, in worry one may say that they were not caught when it still was day<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">370</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Beitzah 3:2:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Beitzah.3.2.1\">Mishnah <i>Beṣah</i> 3:2</a> reads: “One may not take from traps set for game, birds, or fish on the eve of a holiday unless one know that it was caught before the onset of the holiday. It happened that a Gentile brought fish to Rabban Gamliel who said they are permitted but I do not want to accept from him.” The question arises how can one know that an animal was trapped unless one go there and take it out before the holiday. Does the first part of the Mishnah have any practical application? The answer is that by observation from afar one may determine what happened.<br>The main subject of Tractate <i>Beṣah</i> is the requirement, based ostensibly on <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 16:5\" href=\"/Exodus.16.5\"><i>Ex.</i> 16:5</a>, that on the Sabbath and holidays only food prepared beforehand may be consumed. Since cooking on the Sabbath is forbidden, there is no problem regarding Sabbath observation. For the holidays there first is the problem of extending a commandment given for the Sabbath to holidays and second the fact that cooking and other preparation of food is permitted (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 13:16\" href=\"/Exodus.13.16\"><i>Ex.</i> 13:16</a>). Therefore the application of the requirement of preparation can refer only to the accessibility of raw materials. If an animal is trapped before the onset of the holiday it is prepared in this sense and may be taken and turned into food on the holiday. Another question then is whether the extension of <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 16:5\" href=\"/Exodus.16.5\"><i>Ex.</i> 16:5</a> to holidays is considered biblical (when cases of doubt have to be resolved restrictively) or rabbinic (when cases of doubt have to be resolved leniently).</i>.

Any impure Cohen is similarly barred (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 22:3\" href=\"/Leviticus.22.3\"><i>Lev.</i> 22:3</a>).

The question is about the Sabbath. Outside the Temple, the Sabbath prohibitions apply to Cohanim and to everybody else. They are lifted in the Temple precinct by biblical decree.

A cereal offering is forbidden for all consumption from the moment it was received in a sanctified vessel. The priest has to take a handful from the offering and burn it on the altar; this permits the remainder to be eaten by Cohanim (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 6:7-11\" href=\"/Leviticus.6.7-11\"><i>Lev.</i> 6:7–11</a>) but it remains forbidden for all outsiders.</i>; before the handful was taken it was forbidden for both; after the handful was taken it is forbidden for outsiders and permitted to Cohanim?

Because of slaughter<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">181</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Of the sacrifices.</i>. But slaughter by an outsider is valid<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">182</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The office of the Cohen starts only with receiving the victim’s blood in a sacred vessel; slaughter of sacrifices, even on the Sabbath, is legitimate for outsiders, mostly Levites.

In the Sabbatical year, he must tear it out whether [planting was] unintentional or intentional. Rebbi Jehudah says, it is the other way around. If he was planting on the Sabbath he must tear it out whether it was unintentional or intentional; in the Sabbatical, if unintentional, he may keep it, if intentional, he must tear it out. Why? Because the profit of the Sabbath [is forbidden] to him.” And here, since you say that after the end of the Sabbath he has to wait until the time it could have been done, he did not gain anything from the Sabbath. What is the reason of the rabbis? People are suspected about the Sabbatical but not about the Sabbath. Another explanation: One counts Sabbaticals, one does not count Sabbaths. What is this about? If somebody planted less than thirty days before the Sabbatical and now it is the Sabbatical, if it is because of suspicion, there is no suspicion; if it is for counting, it is not counted. Less than thirty days before the eighth year and now it is the eighth year, if it is because of suspicion, there is suspicion; if it is because of counting, there is counting.

                "From where these things? <i>He did one, and did these, and did of these. He did one</i>, to obligate for each one separately; <i>and did these</i>, to obligate for all of them together<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 4:2\" href=\"/Leviticus.4.2\"><i>Lev</i>. 4:2</a> reads: <i>If a person should sin inadvertently against any of the prohibitions of the Eternal and did one of these</i>. The complicated structure of this verse is analyzed in detail in <i>Sifra Ḥova (Wayyiqra II) Parshata</i> 1, <i>Pereq</i> 1. The analysis of the Yerushalmi is attributed in the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Shabbat 103b\" href=\"/Shabbat.103b\">Babli 103b</a> to R. Yose ben Ḥanina, mentioned at the end of the preceding Paragraph. Echoes of the discussion in <i>Sifra</i> are in the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Shabbat 70a\" href=\"/Shabbat.70a\">Babli 70a</a>.<br>The questions raised about the verse are twofold. If it had simply said <i>and did one</i>, we would have inferred that every single infraction needs a separate sacrifice. If it had said <i>and did these</i>, all infractions committed in one state of inadvertence would be covered by one sacrifice. The mention of <i>one</i> in parallel with <i>these</i> creates a seeming contradiction. In addition, in each case the prefix מ “of” in standard rabbinic interpretation is read as “not all”. Then what does it mean that a single prohibition is partially violated?</i>. <i>Of these</i>, to obligate for derivatives<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The last question is easily answered for the Sabbath. Later in the Chapter the forbidden actions on the Sabbath are described by 39 categories. The particular actions labelling the categories are called אַב מְלָאכָה “primary actions”; any other action subsumed under the same category is a תּוֹלְדָה “derivative”. All actions subsumed under the same category are considered identical in some abstract sense even if they actually are very different; e. g. plucking feathers from a bird is forbidden as a derivative of shearing. Any one of the actions subsumed under one category triggers the liability for a sacrifice; it is not necessary that all actions carrying the same label be acted on. On the other hand, most actions trigger liability only if a certain minimum of work was done, as will be detailed in the following Chapters; an action which is too insignificant remains forbidden but does not trigger liability for a sacrifice.</i>. Or should we say that the verse refers to idolatry? Rebbi Zakkai stated before Rebbi Joḥanan: if one sacrificed, and burned incense, and poured a libation in one forgetting he is liable for each one separately. Rebbi Joḥanan said, Babylonian! You crossed by hand three rivers and were broken<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The expression is difficult to understand since one does not cross rivers (in this case Tigris, Euphrates, and Jordan) by hand but by boat. Since the expression is confirmed later in the Chapter and in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Nazir 6:1:2-14\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nazir.6.1.2-14\"><i>Nazir</i> 6:1</a>, it cannot be emended.

Before it was broken in his hand there was <i>one</i> but no <i>these</i>; after it was broken in his hand there was <i>these</i> but no <i>one</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the question was raised whether <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 4:2\" href=\"/Leviticus.4.2\"><i>Lev</i>. 4:2</a> could be interpreted to refer only to idolatry the answer seems to be in the negative, since for R. Zakkai there are only single offenses (<i>one</i>) and no general category (<i>these</i>) whereas for R. Joḥanan the situation is the inverse, in contrast to the Sabbath when liability for a sacrifice can be triggered either by a single action (<i>one</i>) or by a multiplicity of different actions all falling under the same category (<i>these</i>).</i>. But it could be idolatry worshipped by the rules of worship of Heaven as by prostration. In its own worship to obligate for each one separately. By the rules of worship of Heaven to obligate one for all of them<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since in the Second Commandment prostration is mentioned before worship of strange deities it clearly is a separate offense.

In addition in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 20:18\" href=\"/Leviticus.20.18\"><i>Lev</i>. 20:18</a> the sex act is defined at touching of sexual organs; the only actions triggering the liability for a sacrifice are explicitly spelled out in the verses; there are no categories nor derivatives. Cf. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Sanhedrin 7:5:3\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sanhedrin.7.5.3\"><i>Sanhedrin</i> 7:5 (Notes 72–85</a>).</i>.

Since the attempt to derive the rules of the Mishnah from <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 4:2\" href=\"/Leviticus.4.2\"><i>Lev</i>. 4:2</a> ran into difficulties, they propose a direct interpretation of verses referring to the Sabbath only.</i>. Rebbi Ila said, it is written<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 35:2\" href=\"/Exodus.35.2\"><i>Ex</i>. 35:2</a>. The Sabbath is mentioned in the singular.</i>: <i>Anybody doing work on it shall by put to death</i>, not one who does on it and another. You are saying, the Sabbaths do not combine. Do they separate<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That Sabbaths do not combine means that if somebody did less than a punishable amount of work on one Sabbath and again less than a punishable amount the next Sabbath they do not add up to the liability for a sacrifice even if the actions were committed in the same period of oblivion of the rules of the Sabbath. In this the rules of the Sabbath parallel the rules of forbidden fat. Eating forbidden fat triggers the liability for a sacrifice only if a minimum was eaten within the time of a meal (defined as time needed to eat half a loaf of bread, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Horayot 3:2:12\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Horayot.3.2.12\"><i>Horaiot</i> 3:3 Note 66</a>). Less than minimum amounts eaten at different times do not trigger liability. On the other hand, once liability was triggered within one period of oblivion, it automatically covers all other offenses of the same kind during the same period of oblivion. The question is now asked whether if an inadvertent desecration of the Sabbath triggered the obligation of a sacrifice and the perpetrator did not become aware of his offense before committing the same also on another Sabbath, he is liable for only one or for several sacrifices?</i>?

Rebbi Yose said, it makes no difference whether He first gave the principle and then the detail or He gave the detail and only later the principle, or He gave principle, detail, and principle; it is a matter of principle and detail.

If a house is considered real estate, it cannot become forbidden by worship, and its improper use while in the possession of the Temple cannot trigger a fine for larceny. If it is not considered real estate since the building materials were movables before being used, but it can become forbidden and improper use can trigger the fine.</i>?

Rebbi Samuel bar Sisarta said, from two you infer four. Just as for two you start at the beginning of six and reduce continuously, so for four you start at the beginning of six and reduce continuously. It is impossible<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">78</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The correct Yerushalmi form for “impossible”; the form אי אפשר in <b>כ</b> is Babylonian.</i> that there should not be a free space to plant in the middle<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">79</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The argument as explained by R. Simson: At the end of the paragraph, it is stated that one deals with a vegetable bed surrounded by other vegetable beds. The rules of “jailing” (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 2:5:5\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.2.5.5\"><i>Kilaim</i> 2:8 Note 120</a>) prohibit to grow one kind of produce on a field surrounded by four fields on which other kinds are grown and therefore require that at the corners squares of one hand-breadth each must be empty. In order to grow two kinds of plants, one may sow two strips, each 4 hand-breadths long, along parallel edges, each one 2.25 hand-breadths wide, so that the required separation of 1.5 hand-breadths be observed in the middle. But then the argument may be used also for the other two edges. This means that one sows four triangular patches; each one has a base of 4 hand-breadths on an edge of the garden bed, with base angles of 45°. These triangles must be separated by strips 1.5 hand-breadths wide. This means that at the edges, we must leave a square of edge length <i>a</i> empty, whose diagonal is 1.5 = <i>a</i>2<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">½</sup>. Hence, <i>a</i> = 1.061; the bases of the triangle can only be 3.878 hand-breadths. In that case, the distance of the third vertex of the triangle from its base is equal to half the base on the edge, or 1.939 hand-breadths. The distance from the center is <i>a</i> = 1.061 &lt; 1.5. In order to plant a single seed in the middle, it is therefore necessary to cut off the triangles at distance 1.5 from center and edge, creating four congruent trapezoids. The height of a trapezoid is <i>h</i>=1.5, its base 2<i>b</i>=3.878. By similar triangles, the length <i>t</i> of its top is given by 2<i>b</i>/<i>b</i> = <i>t</i>/(<i>b-h</i>) or <i>t</i> = 0.878. That makes it possible to plant a single fifth kind in a small space in the middle. The total area planted amounts to four times the area of the trapezoids, 15.044 square hand-breadths, plus the area of the small space in the middle.</i>. Rebbi Jonah said, working space joins working space but a kind does not meet another kind to jail it<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">80</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Each separate kind needs a working space around it, given by the strip of width 1.5 hand-breadths, but the same strip does serve two different kinds without problem. Also, the rules of “jailing” only apply to fields, not to garden beds.</i>. Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: <i>Its seed, its seeds, its sown seeds</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">81</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here starts a new approach, <i>viz</i>., that the verse itself implies more than 2 kinds. The word זרוע appears only twice in the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Isaiah 61:11\" href=\"/Isaiah.61.11\">Bible, <i>Is</i>. 61:11</a> and in a description of grain (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 11:37\" href=\"/Leviticus.11.37\"><i>Lev</i>. 11:37</a>): <i>seeds of seedlings that may be sown</i>. In contrast to modern dictionaries which take זרוע as a word different from זרע, the authors here take it as expansion of זרע “seed.” The root is expanded three times, by taking the plural, adding a possessive suffix, and adding the letter ו. Each change is taken as a plural, hence three plurals are added for a total of six units.</i>. That follows Rebbi Jehudah, since Rebbi Jehudah said six, <i>seed, its seed, its seeds, its sown seeds</i>. Rebbi Ḥaggai said, זרעיה has five letters; everywhere I find ו I delete it<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">82</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Ḥaggai assumes that originally all Hebrew spelling was what is called defective. Hence, any ו or י that is neither part of the root nor required by grammatical rules is considered an addition by later scribes and therefore is disregarded. That eliminates the ו but leaves the י which is required as sign of plural. One ends up with five letters, following the anonymous opinion in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 3:1:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.3.1.1\">Mishnah <i>Kilaim</i>3:1</a>.</i>. This was asked of Rebbi Ḥuna, the scribe of the assembly, and he said, זירועיה is written plene<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">83</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The spelling זירעיה in the text is certainly wrong since the expression of <i>ṣere</i> by י is standard only in Mishnaic and later texts, not in Biblical ones. Hence, the <i>plene</i> writing refers to the masoretic spelling of the word; one has six letters, supporting Rebbi Jehudah.</i>.

Then one may sow four 1-by-l corner patches, four 1-by-l patches at the center of each edge, and a center diamond, for a total of nine patches.</i>. Then we should state “nine!” Rebbi Tanḥum from Bostra said, that is true. But our Mishnah speaks of a garden bed in the middle of garden beds<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">87</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the rules of “jailing” apply to garden beds as a whole, not to smaller patches, the corners cannot be sown. This is the opinion of Samuel in the Babli (<i>Šabbat</i> 86b). Otherwise, it really is possible to sow 9 kinds, as the Babli puts it (<i>Šabbat</i> 86a), in the case of a garden bed planted on land otherwise dry, with no other beds nearby.

In what do they differ? They differ in complete terms. Rebbi Ismael treats part of a term like the whole, but Rebbi Aqiba does not treat part of a term like the whole.

It was stated so about Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah: Sometimes after slightly more than a day she is pure; sometimes after slightly less than two days she is impure.

In the meantime, the <i>ṭevul yom</i> person does not contaminate anything by his touch but is not permitted any sanctified food (cf. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 1:1:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.1.1.1\"><i>Berakhot</i> 1:1 Note 3</a>).</i>.

Rebbi Joḥanan said, these are the words of Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah, and Rebbi Ismael, and Rebbi Aqiba. But the word of the Sages is, up to three days; after that it decayed. This parallels what Rebbi Zeˋira said in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: <i>This are the instructions for the sufferer from gonorrhea and from whom semen is</i> <i>ejaculated</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">106</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 15:32\" href=\"/Leviticus.15.32\"><i>Lev</i>. 15:32</a>.</i>.

The first alternative is discussed first.<br>R. Meïr does not consider a hole which is a defect in the wall but one built into the wall as a window, where the wind may enter the house, which presents a narrow slit to the outside but is wide inside. If the width at the other end of the wall is 4 hand-breadths, he completes the trapezoidal shape of the base of the opening to a rectangle to which the rules of private domain do apply.

This now is connected with a problem about heave, which must be eaten by a Cohen in purity. Consumption of heave by an unauthorized person not only is sinful but subjects the offender to a fine of 25% of the value of the food used illegitimately. If such a person uses heave vinegar to dip his bread he clearly uses food and is subject to the fine. If he uses the vinegar as medicine he sinned twice (he used heave illegitimately and he did not use it as food) but he is not subject to the fine.

                "<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “Rebbi Eliezer says, if one did not bring the implement,” etc. Rebbi Joḥanan said, we were of the opinion to say that Rebbi Eliezer disagrees in all cases<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The question is whether R. Eliezer permits to perform preparations on the Sabbath which could have been made on Friday for circumcision only or in general for any action prescribed for the Sabbath even if it involves doing work which under other circumstances would be Sabbath violations.</i>. Since Rebbi Eliezer needed to explain “first fruits;” since “first fruits” mentioned with the <i>ˋomer</i> push the Sabbath aside, so also “first fruits” mentioned with the Two Breads push the Sabbath aside<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The ˋ<i>omer</i> is a measure, a tenth of an <i>epha,</i> about 3.5 liter, of new barley grain which is offered in the Temple to permit the consumption of grain from the new harvest. It has to be brought <i>on the day after the Sabbath (Lev.</i> 23:15) which in rabbinic tradition is the second day of the Feast of unleavened bread, in the Sadducee tradition of the Book of Jubilees the day following the Feast, and in Boethusian tradition on the Sunday in the Feast. The common testimony of Philo and Josephus shows that rabbinic tradition was followed in the Temple service. The ˋ<i>omer</i> had to be brought to the Temple on a fixed date, even if this date was a Sabbath (except for Boethusians for which this never could happen.) Therefore it is clear that there is a biblical prescription to cut the barley on the Sabbath if that is the day on which the grain has to be offered.<br>The Two Breads are the only leavened bread ever permitted in the Temple precinct; they have to be presented to the altar (but not offered on it) on the festival of Weeks <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 23:17\" href=\"/Leviticus.23.17\"><i>(Lev.</i> 23:17</a>), which falls on the 50th day after the <i>ˋomer,</i> on the same day of the week as the <i>ˋomer.</i> These Two Breads permit the use of new wheat in the Temple service. R. Eliezer concludes from an argument of “equal cut”, since both the <i>ˋomer</i> and the Two Breads are referred to in the verse as “first fruits” that they follow the same rules and, therefore, if the two loaves were not baked before the Sabbath they may be baked on the Sabbath.</i>; this implies that Rebbi Eliezer does not disagree in all cases<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If it were understood that in all cases of a prescribed action on the Sabbath the preparation also can be done on the Sabbath the argument of “equal cut” would be unnecessary. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Shabbat 131a\" href=\"/Shabbat.131a\">Babli 131a</a>.</i>. Rebbi Samuel ben Rav Isaac said, Rebbi Eliezer disagrees in all cases<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This sentence is missing in modern editions of the Yerushalmi.</i>, and why did Rebbi Eliezer have to explain “first fruits” “first fruits”? Only because their essence pushes aside the Sabbath but their enabling actions are work<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Joḥanan’s argument is not convincing. For the <i>ˋomer</i> the action of harvesting is prescribed on the day of the sacrifice (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 23:10\" href=\"/Leviticus.23.10\"><i>Lev.</i> 23:10</a>); the grain must be roasted (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 2:14\" href=\"/Leviticus.2.14\"><i>Lev.</i> 2:14</a>) and part of it burned on the altar. This means that both the preparation and the offering involve actions that are violations of Sabbath prohibitions. But the Two Breads are simply presented to the altar; no part of them may be burned on the altar (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 2:12\" href=\"/Leviticus.2.12\"><i>Lev.</i> 2:12</a>); they have to be eaten by the priests in the Temple precinct. This means that the offering itself does not imply any Sabbath violation; there is no intrinsic reason which would allow baking the breads on the Sabbath.</i>.

For R. Eliezer cutting the plants may be done on the Sabbath. The statement has to be dated before the destruction of the Temple since in Rabban Joḥanan ben Zakkai’s reconstruction of rabbinic Judaism at Jabneh, in imitation of a Temple ceremony the obligation to take the “four kinds” was extended to all seven days of Tabernacles which automatically re-instituted the rules of the Sabbath as preeminent. Here the situation is completely parallel to that of the Two Breads in that taking the Four Kinds on the holiday does not involve any Sabbath desecration; but the preparation involves forms of harvesting which are forbidden on the Sabbath.</i>?

The Mishnah printed in the Venice edition of the Yerushalmi and reproduced at the start of this Chapter (not from the Leiden ms.) states liability if the baby scheduled for Friday was circumcised on the Sabbath and notes a controversy if the one scheduled for Sunday was circumcised on the Sabbath. In the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Shabbat 137a\" href=\"/Shabbat.137a\">Babli 137a</a> this version is attributed to R. Ḥiyya (the Elder). The Mishnah in the Babli switches the two cases. A <i>baraita</i> in the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Shabbat 137a\" href=\"/Shabbat.137a\">Babli 137a</a> in the name of R. Meïr keeps the order of the Mishnah of the Yerushalmi but states “not liable” in the first case. In the following, different authorities seem to accept different readings. The interpretation given here in general follows S. Liebermann.</i> Rebbi Joḥanan said, it is Rebbi Meïr’s who said, for something where there is a commandment performed one is not liable, but if no commandment is performed whether he is liable is disputed<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">112</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It seems that R. Joḥanan reads in the Mishnah a text similar to that attributed to R. Meïr in the Babli. If he circumcises the baby scheduled for Sabbath on Friday he violates a positive commandment, <i>viz.,</i> to circumcise on the eighth day, but no liability for a sacrifice is created. If then he circumcises the one scheduled for Friday on the Sabbath, he violates the Sabbath but in the act satisfies a commandment; according to R. Meïr this frees him from liability.</i>. Rebbi Simeon says, where there is a commandment performed one is liable, but if no commandment is performed whether he is not liable is disputed<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">113</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Simeon reads the Mishnah as given at the start of this Chapter. The fact that the baby scheduled for Friday had to be circumcised and the circumcision on the Sabbath accomplished this does not free from liability for the desecration of the Sabbath.<br>Since the text in <i>Pesaḥim</i> confirms the text here there is no possibility to emend “liable” into “not liable” as proposed by the classical commentaries.</i>. Rebbi Yose in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: The word of Rebbi Meïr is, on condition that it be a sheep without blemish, a yearling, and a well-being sacrifice fit to be changed into a Passover sacrifice<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">114</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This refers to <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Pesachim 6:5:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Pesachim.6.5.1\">Mishnah <i>Pesaḥim</i> 6:9</a> (6:5 in most independent Mishnah mss.) where in a discussion of liability if a Passover sacrifice was slaughtered incorrectly on a Sabbath which was a 14<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">th</sup> of Nisan, R. Eliezer notes that obligatory sacrifices must be slaughtered on the Sabbath but that a person slaughtering a private sacrifice in the name of a public one on the Sabbath is liable but R. Meïr declares him not liable. R. Joshua rejects a comparison of public and private sacrifices since public sacrifices are prescribed in number but the number of private ones is unlimited.<br>R. Joḥanan notes that R. Meïr exempts from liability only if the error was excusable. A Passover sacrifice must be without blemish, male, and a yearling (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 12:5\" href=\"/Exodus.12.5\"><i>Ex.</i>12:5</a>). A blemished animal cannot be a sacrifice at all; slaughtering a blemished animal as a sacrifice is an inexcusable error. A well-being sacrifice may be male or female and of almost any age (more than 8 days old). Such an animal can be a candidate for Passover sacrifice only if it is a male yearling. If the three conditions are satisfied an illegal switching between the categories is excusable.</i>. One understands from this three consequences. One understands something which is not a fixed number<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">115</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This excludes sacrificing privately in the name of public sacrifices.</i>. And which is not usually exchanged<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">116</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This seems to contradict the prior statement that only well-being sacrifices are exempt from liability if they are fit to be Passover sacrifices. Therefore the commentaries emend the statement to read: And which usually is exchanged. Since the statement is not discussed further in the Halakhah, there is no certainty achievable but since the text is identical in both sources one would have to assume a corruption in the original common source. There is no difficulty explaining the text as it stands. If it were something that routinely can be changed, such as excess Passover animals reclassified as animals for well-being sacrifices, and if the slaughter were legitimate for the new denomination, there would be universal agreement that everything is legitimate and there is merit, never liability. The question of liability can arise only if such a reclassification is unusual and has not been effected.</i>.

In Rebbi Zeˋira’s opinion following Rebbi Yannai Rav followed Rebbi Meïr<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">127</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The language is elliptic (but, as S. Liebermann has pointed out, it also appears otherwise in the Yerushalmi, cf. <i>Eruvin</i> 6, 23c l. 65). R. Zeˋira asserts that accepting the interpretation of the Mishnah given by R. Yannai, there exists a (not otherwise reported) decision by Rav which follows the reading of the Mishnah ascribed to Rav, which therefore decides practice.</i>. Rebbi Mana said before Rebbi Yose, what Rav Ḥisda said follows Rebbi Simeon, and what Rebbi Zeˋira said follows Rebbi Meïr. Can one object anything between Rebbi Meïr and Rebbi Simeon<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">128</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The two opinions are based on two different readings of the Mishnah; there should be no need to try to harmonize the opinions. It is not explained who tried to harmonize them.</i>? Do we find a difference between Rebbi Meïr and Rebbi Simeon about the remainder<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">129</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Both agree that there must be a baby left to be circumcised, or a sacrifice to be slaughtered, to lift liability from an untimely circumcision or slaughter.</i>? How do you treat the babies in doubt? Like something which is a fixed amount or something which is not a fixed amount<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">130</sup><i class=\"footnote\">How can one apply the arguments from the Mishnah in <i>Pesaḥim</i> to the case in <i>Šabbat?</i></i>? If you are treating it like something which is a fixed amount … only if there remains another baby to circumcise<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">131</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The text in <i>Pesaḥim</i> adds:<br>אפי׳ אין שם תינוק אחד למול. ואין תעבדינון כדבר<br>שאין לו קיצבה.<br>“even if there is not one baby to be circumcised. But if you are treating it like something which is not a fixed amount,” and one has to read this text here also. In <i>Pesaḥim</i> one infers that R. Joshua agrees with R. Eliezer that in matters of public sacrifices, which are fixed in numbers, there is no excuse for additional slaughter and any error will result in liability. But in matters of private offerings (excluding purification and reparation offerings, which follow the rules of public sacrifices) where the numbers are indefinite, he denies liability for additional infractions of the rules of the Sabbath. Therefore in the case here he might agree to liability if the baby scheduled for Friday was circumcised on the Sabbath only if the case is compared to public sacrifices.</i>. Rebbi Yose said, the words of the rabbis make the case like something which is not a fixed amount: only if there remains another baby to circumcise. Come and see: If he anticipated his time he is not liable, if he delayed his time he is liable<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">132</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The position of R. Joshua in the Mishnah does not seem reasonable (assuming R. Meïr’s argument.) By circumcising the baby scheduled for Friday on the Sabbath he fulfills a commandment (even though a day late) and is declared liable; but by circumcising the baby scheduled for Sunday on the Sabbath he does not fulfil a commandment (since its time has not yet arrived) but is declared not liable!</i>? Rav Huna said, the Mishnah is the other way around, as it was stated<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">133</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Shabbat 137a\" href=\"/Shabbat.137a\">Babli 137a</a>.</i>: Rebbi Simeon said, Rebbi Eliezer and Rebbi Joshua did not disagree about one which was to be circumcised after the Sabbath if he circumcised him on the Sabbath that he is liable, but one who was to be circumcised before the Sabbath if he circumcised him on the Sabbath where Rebbi Eliezer makes him liable for a purification sacrifice and Rebbi Joshua declares him not liable. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, because of this objection it was difficult for Rebbi Yannai, only if he forgot and circumcised the one of the Sabbath on Friday<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">134</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The explanation given in Note 18 is necessary; if both babies are still uncircumcised on the Sabbath R. Joshua will declare him not liable even if the one scheduled for Friday is circumcised first.</i>. Rebbi Ada bar Ahavah said, these are the words of Rebbi Meïr and Rebbi Simeon, but the words of Rebbi Yose [are]: Even if no commandment is performed he is not liable since he erred on behalf of a commandment<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">135</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For example, if on Passover he slaughtered a defective animal as sacrifice when no commandment could be fulfilled with it.</i>.",
