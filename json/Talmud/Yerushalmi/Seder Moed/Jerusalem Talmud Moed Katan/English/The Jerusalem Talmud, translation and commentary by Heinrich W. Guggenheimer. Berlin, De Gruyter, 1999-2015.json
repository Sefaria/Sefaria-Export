                "<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “One waters irrigated plots,” etc. One understands a well which does not flow newly. A well which flows newly? Is that not requiring effort<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the water has to be directed to the desired spot, a bed has to be dug for the stream. This may involve more work than compatible with the idea of a holiday. (Differently in the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Moed Katan 2a\" href=\"/Moed_Katan.2a\">Babli, 2a</a>.)</i>? But it follows Rebbi Meïr, as Rebbi Meïr says, one uses it to irrigate even a field depending on rain water<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The general rule is that agricultural work is forbidden unless needed to avoid loss. A new well is a precious source; to waste its water would be great loss. Since the water is not yet channelled, it may be directed to any place desired.<br>A field not irrigated depends on rain water. The expression <i>bet habba`al</i> really is idolatrous since <i>Ba`al</i>, like the Greek Zeus, is rain (considered the god of rain).</i>. Rebbi Yose said, it is the opinion of everybody if it was one and became two or its waters were few and it was blessed<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In this case also no new bed has to be constructed.</i>. We have stated thus<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Tosefta Moed Katan (Lieberman) 1:1\" href=\"/Tosefta_Moed_Katan_(Lieberman).1.1\">Tosephta 1:1</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Moed Katan 2a\" href=\"/Moed_Katan.2a\">Babli 2a</a>.</i>: “From a well which flowed newly one irrigates even a field depending on rain water, the words of Rebbi Meïr; but the Sages are saying one uses it to irrigate only an irrigated plot which dried up<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In this case also no new bed has to be constructed.</i>.” In the opinion of Rebbi Meïr one irrigates from it something not in danger of loss and something requiring effort. In the opinion of the rabbis one irrigates from it only something in danger of loss and only if not requiring effort. What do the rabbis say if there is danger of loss but it requires effort<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This case is not covered by the Tosephta.</i>? Let us hear from the following: Anything which is continuously losing value is an irrigated plot<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even a field used in extensive agriculture becomes one of intensive culture if it needs additional water to save the crop.</i>. When it stopped weakening it is a field depending on rain water; the disagreement between Rebbi Meïr and the Sages<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Meïr but not the Sages would allow additional irrigation.</i>. How long does it have to be irrigated to become an irrigated field? Only if was irrigated two, three days before the holiday? Let us hear from the following: The Qabray<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">An otherwise unidentified Iraqi brook.</i> dried up three days before the holiday, and it came back on the holiday. The case came before Rav Ḥuna who said, those weakened shall be irrigated, those not weakened may not be irrigated<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A direct application of the rule spelled out before, following the Sages. In addition, it shows that anything happened more than 3 days before the holiday is disregarded, answering the question.</i>. Rebbi Jonah and Rebbi Yose instructed about that cool shadowy place which was sown with barley that it should be cut on the holiday to avoid their cracking and being lost<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They extend the rule which turns extensive into intensive agriculture to all cases, not only the supply of water.</i>.",
                "One understands pumped water. Rain water? Rebbi Joḥanan said, they decided about rain water because it is like pumped water<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Moed Katan 4a\" href=\"/Moed_Katan.4a\">Babli 4a</a>.</i>. Rebbi Bisna in the name of Rebbi La: They stated this only on a holiday; therefore in the Sabbatical it is permitted. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is a close parallel to this text in <i>Ševi`it</i>2:10 (Notes 107–109).</i> What is the difference between Sabbatical and holiday? In the Sabbatical when work is permitted they permitted both activities requiring effort and activities not requiring effort. On a holiday when work is forbidden they only permitted to avoid loss and only activities not requiring effort. Some want to understand it from the following: In the Sabbatical which is extended they permitted, on a holiday which is short they forbade. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">From here on to almost the end of the Tractate there are Genizah fragments edited by L. Ginzberg (G).</i> Then these last seven days should be compared to the seven days of a holiday and be forbidden<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The last seven days of the Sabbatical then should be treated like intermediate days of a holiday in these matters.

If in a time when it rains, is it not as if irrigating the ocean<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This and the following arguments can be summarized simply by stating that the original source of the water in the pond is irrelevant.

But we must hold in the time when the rain stopped. If it is in the time when the rain stopped, is this not like a pond which was filled from a well, but water supply from the well stopped?

This implies that one irrigates from a pond which was filled with pumped water but one channelled well water into it.

Lieberman (<i>Tarbiz</i> 3) accepts the editor’s addition as genuine (but more likely would be חד בירבי). The only certain statement is that the Venice text is not a genuine version of the Yerushalmi.</i>.

Therefore if the rabbinic rules for mourning are modelled on the biblical of the <i>nazir</i>, the Mishnah gives support both for the 30th and the 31st as days of shaving by the mourner.</i>, he shaves for the first on the 31st day, for the second on the 61st day.” Rebbi Yose said, there after it happened, here from the start<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">141</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R.

R. Zeriqan seems to hold that what is acceptable after the fact in biblical rules is permitted from the start in rabbinic usage.</i>. Rebbi Jeremiah instructed Rebbi Isaac from Aṭoshia, and some say, Rav Ḥiyya ben Rebbi Isaac from Aṭoshia, to shave on the 30th day, following the Mishnah: “Eight days, the decree of 30 days is waived for him.” The eighth has the same status as the 30th day<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">142</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The argument here goes as follows: If the 8th day of mourning was holiday eve, the mourner can shave in the afternoon in preparation for the holiday. The time elapsed from dawn to the afternoon is counted as a full day for him. Therefore, the person who shaves on the 30th day can nevertheless count the entire 30th day as being part of his mourning period.</i>. Rebbi Yose said, there is a difference; there they permitted in order to honor the holiday. You should know this, since Rebbi Ḥelbo, Rav Ḥuna said in the name of Rav: If his eighth day fell on the Sabbath, he shaves Friday. If you say that they did permit not in order to honor the holiday, then even if his 30th day falls on the Sabbath, he should shave Sabbath eve<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">143</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nobody permits shaving on the 29th day.</i>.

Rebbi Jehudah says, any tear which does not completely sever the trim is a frivolous tear. Rebbi Joḥanan disagrees with Rebbi Jehudah in two things. Rebbi Joḥanan heard that Rebbi Ḥanina was weak. He was going up to visit him. On the road he heard that he had died. He descended from his donkey, took out the good Sabbath garment, and tore it.

Rebbi Joḥanan said, really low. Rebbi Eleazar in the name of Cahana follows Rebbi Jehudah. If following Rebbi Jehudah, he should not tear at all! How about this? It is a stringency for the High Priest that he shall sever the seam completely<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">371</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Meaning that it is a stringency for the High Priest that he is forbidden to sever the seam completely. The High Priest is forbidden to let his hair grow or tear his clothes (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 21:10\" href=\"/Leviticus.21.10\"><i>Lev</i>. 21:10</a>). R. Meïr interprets the verse to mean that in mourning he may not tear his garment in the way other people do The Mishnah is R. Meïr’s. It is obvious that one speaks here of the High Priest’s personal belonging, not his robes of office, which may not be torn (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 28:32\" href=\"/Exodus.28.32\"><i>Ex</i>. 28:32</a>,<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 29:23\" href=\"/Exodus.29.23\">29:23</a>). The point is made that <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 21:10\" href=\"/Leviticus.21.10\"><i>Lev</i>. 21:10</a> does not use the frequently used verb קרע “to tear” but the infrequent פרם “to tear in little pieces”. This is interpreted in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Sifra, Emor, Section 2 3\" href=\"/Sifra,_Emor,_Section_2.3\"><i>Sifra Emor Parashah</i> 2(3</a>) to mean that the High Priest is not totally forbidden to rend his garments, only he may not do what everybody does.
