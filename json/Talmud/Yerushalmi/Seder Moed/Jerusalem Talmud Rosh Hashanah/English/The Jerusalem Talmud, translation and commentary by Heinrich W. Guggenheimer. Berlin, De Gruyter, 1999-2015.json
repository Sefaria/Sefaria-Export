                "<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> There are four New Year’s Days. On the first of Nisan is New Year for kings<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The first year of a king’s reign terminates at the end of Adar, irrespective of when he gained the throne. This is important for the dating of documents by regnal years and represents the practice in Mishnaic times and the early Israelite monarchic period. Mesopotamian practice uses the first of Tishre (“beginning”) for the same purpose.</i> and for holidays<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In all biblical holiday lists the sequence is Passover-Pentecost-Tabernacles.

For you it is the head of the months but it is head neither for years nor for Sabbatical periods nor for Jubilees<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is clear from <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 25\" href=\"/Leviticus.25\"><i>Lev.</i>25</a> that Sabbaticals and Jubilees are counted from the end of the agricultural year in the month of the fall equinox.</i> nor for planting<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To determine the years of <i>`orlah</i>, when no fruit may be taken.</i> nor for vegetables<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To determine the year for purposes of the tithe since inferred from <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Deuteronomy 14:22\" href=\"/Deuteronomy.14.22\"><i>Deut</i>. 14:22</a>, which requires agricultural tithe being given <i>year by year</i>, that no tithe may be given from produce of one year for produce grown in another.</i>.

If the same number is used to describe the month in the sequence of months and the month in the year, it follows that the year must start with month one.</i> <i>in the fourth year of his reign</i>. It bracketed the fourth year of his reign with the second of the months. Since the second of the months is only counted from Nisan, also the second in the fourth year of his reign is only counted from Nisan. Or is it only the second in the month? Any place where the second day in the month is intended it is explicit<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is how the unofficial Targum of <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"II Chronicles 3:2\" href=\"/II_Chronicles.3.2\"><i>2Chr.</i>3:2</a> reads it: He started to build on the second day of the second month of the fourth year; a reading also rejected in the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Rosh Hashanah 3a\" href=\"/Rosh_Hashanah.3a\">Babli 3a</a> since it always is stated as “day nin the month.”</i>.

Rebbi Ḥanania and Rebbi Mana. One said, <i>he started to build in the second month,</i> that is the second of the months; <i>in the second</i>, that is the second in the year. But the other one, even if you switch it does not change anything. Rebbi Simeon bar Karsana in the name of Rebbi Aḥa understood it from the following: <i>This month is for you</i>, an exclusion. <i>The first it be for you</i>, [an exclusion.] An exclusion after an exclusion is to include<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A general principle in both Talmudim. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Peah 6:7:3\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.6.7.3\"><i>Peah</i>6:9 Note 154</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 12:1:2-17\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.12.1.2-17\"><i>Yebamot</i> 12:1</a> Note10, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Sotah 9:2:6\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sotah.9.2.6\"><i>Soṭah 9:2</i> Note 63</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Horayot 1:1:4\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Horayot.1.1.4\"><i>Horaiot</i>1:1 Note 9</a> <i>q. v.</i>, <i>Megillah</i>4:4 75b l.14; <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Megillah 23b\" href=\"/Megillah.23b\">Babli <i>Megillah</i>23b</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Yoma 43a\" href=\"/Yoma.43a\"><i>Yoma</i>43a</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Bava Kamma 15b\" href=\"/Bava_Kamma.15b\"><i>Bava qamma</i>15b</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Bava Batra 15a\" href=\"/Bava_Batra.15a\"><i>Bava batra</i>15a</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Sanhedrin 15a\" href=\"/Sanhedrin.15a\"><i>Sanhedrin</i>15a</a>,<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Sanhedrin 44b\" href=\"/Sanhedrin.44b\">44b</a>,<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Sanhedrin 66a\" href=\"/Sanhedrin.66a\">66a</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Makkot 9b\" href=\"/Makkot.9b\"><i>Makkot</i>9b</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Shevuot 7b\" href=\"/Shevuot.7b\"><i>Ševuot</i>7b</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Menachot 9b\" href=\"/Menachot.9b\"><i>Menaḥot</i>9b</a>,<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Menachot 67a\" href=\"/Menachot.67a\">67a</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Chullin 132a\" href=\"/Chullin.132a\"><i>Ḥulin</i>132a</a>.</i> for kings and holidays. Could one include for years, or for Sabbatical periods, or for Jubilees, or for planting, or for vegetables? Following what Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa, Rebbi Yasa in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan said: It is written, <i>he started to build in the second month, in the second, in the fourth year of his reign</i>. It bracketed the fourth year of his reign with the second of the months. Since the second of the months is only counted from Nisan, also the second in the fourth year of his reign is only counted from Nisan. Rebbi Jonah, Rebbi Isaac bar Naḥman in the name of Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Joseph: <i>He started to build in the second month</i>, that is the second of the months; <i>in the second</i>, that is the second in the year. And when he says, <i>in the fourth year of his reign</i>, it bracketed the fourth year of his reign with the second of the months. Since the second of the months is only counted from Nisan, also the second in the fourth year of his reign is only counted from Nisan. Samuel stated and disagreed<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He holds that the count of years depends on the political circumstances.</i>: <i>In the third month of the Israelites’ exodus from Egypt</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 19:1\" href=\"/Exodus.19.1\"><i>Ex.</i> 19:1</a>.</i>. From here that one counts months from the exodus from Egypt. Not only months, from where years? <i>The Eternal spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai in the second year</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Numbers 9:1\" href=\"/Numbers.9.1\"><i>Num</i>. 9:1</a>.</i>. Not only at that time, from where later? <i>In the fortieth year of the Israelites’ exodus from Egypt</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Numbers 33:38\" href=\"/Numbers.33.38\"><i>Num</i>. 33:38</a>. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Rosh Hashanah 2b\" href=\"/Rosh_Hashanah.2b\">Babli 2b</a></i>. Not only temporarily, from where for later generations? <i>It was in the 480th year of the Israelites’ exodus from Egypt</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"I Kings 6:1\" href=\"/I_Kings.6.1\"><i>1K.</i>6:1</a>.</i>, etc. After the Temple had been built they started to count from its building: <i>It was at the end of twenty years after Salomon built the two houses</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"I Kings 9:1\" href=\"/I_Kings.9.1\"><i>1K</i>. 9:1</a>.</i>. They did not merit to count from its building, they started counting from its destruction: <i>In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, on New Year’s Day, on the tenth of the month</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Ezekiel 40:1\" href=\"/Ezekiel.40.1\"><i>Ez</i>. 40:1</a>. In a Jubilee year, New Year’s day is moved to the Day of Atonement; cf. the author’s edition of <i>Seder Olam</i>(Northvale 1998), pp. 118–119, Note 4.</i>, etc. They did not merit to count for themselves, they started counting regnal years, [as it is written,] <i>in year two of Darius</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Haggai 1:1\" href=\"/Haggai.1.1\"><i>Ḥaggai</i>1:1</a>.</i>; <i>in year three of Cyrus, king of Persia</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Daniel 10:1\" href=\"/Daniel.10.1\"><i>Dan</i>. 10:1</a>.</i>.

It bracketed the fourth year of his reign with the second of the months. Since the second of the months is only counted from Nisan, also the second in the fourth year of his reign is only counted from Nisan.",
                "Rebbi Eleazar in the name of Rebbi Ḥanina: Also for the kings of the peoples of the world one only counts from Nisan<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He holds that Jewish documents, in particular biblical reports, always start regnal years in Nisan, irrespective of the official calendar of the kingdom to which it refers. The <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Rosh Hashanah 3b\" href=\"/Rosh_Hashanah.3b\">Babli 3b</a> admits this only for good kings.</i>. <i>In the sixth, in year two of Darius</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Haggai 1:15\" href=\"/Haggai.1.15\"><i>Ḥaggai</i>1:15</a>. He reports that they started to build the Second Temple on 6/24 of year 2 of Darius.</i>. <i>In the eighth, [in year] two of Darius</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Zechariah 1:1\" href=\"/Zechariah.1.1\"><i>Sach</i>. 1:1</a>. If the regnal year of Darius were counted from the start of the 7th Month, Tishre, the eighth month would have to be in year three.</i>. Should we not say, “in the eighth in year three”? Heipha said, the eighth was said first but there is no earlier and later in the Torah<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since Sacharia scolds the people for not building the Temple in the eighth Month of year 2 of Darius, this must precede the date given by Haggai. Therefore the regnal year cannot be counted from Nisan, but it runs from the 1st of Tishre to the end of the following sixth month, against R. Ḥanina. That <i>Sacharia</i> is written after <i>Haggai</i> in the minor prophets has no chronological relevance. “Torah” here includes the entire Hebrew Bible (and Mishnah, Note 318) and is not restricted to the Pentateuch. Cf. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Megillah 1:2:2\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Megillah.1.2.2\"><i>Megillah</i>1:2</a> (70d l.59); also <i>Sheqalim</i>6:1 (49d l. 70) and <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Sotah 8:3:12\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sotah.8.3.12\"><i>Sotah</i>8:3 (Note 127</a>) as minority opinion of R. Meïr. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Pesachim 6b\" href=\"/Pesachim.6b\">Babli <i>Pesaḥim</i>6b</a> (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Bamidbar Rabbah 9:44\" href=\"/Bamidbar_Rabbah.9.44\"><i>Num. rabba</i>9(44</a>)).</i>. Rebbi Jonah said, it is written: <i>and now take notice, starting with this day, before a stone is set upon stone in the Temple of the Eternal</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Haggai 2:15\" href=\"/Haggai.2.15\"><i>Haggai</i>2:15</a>. The prophecy is dated 9/2 of year 2 of Darius.</i>. How is this? In the sixth the foundation stone was laid. In the eighth<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This must read: “ninth”.</i> this verse was said. If you are saying, they already laid, Heipha is correct. If you are saying, they did not lay, Heipha did not say anything<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If the prophet says that while they are building the Temple they already notice that God’s blessing of Judean agriculture started before they actually started building, the statement cannot be used to determine the start of regnal years.</i>. Rebbi Isaac objected: Is it not written<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Genesis 9:13\" href=\"/Genesis.9.13\"><i>Gen</i>. 9:13</a>.</i>, <i>it was in the 601-st year, in the first, on the first day of the month?</i> And it was stated on this, the year of the Flood is not counted<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This argument presupposes that Noe’s years are treated as regnal years. This is not the position of <i>Seder Olam</i>(of Babylonian redaction) which asserts that the numbers given in <i>Gen</i>. may be added, which means that overlapping parts of years have been eliminated. If the year started in Tishre, in the middle of the Flood, the statement is acceptable, but not if it started in Nisan, since the flood started only on 2/17 of that year. This problem is treated in detail by the 16th Cent. Rabbi Moses Almosnino (published in <i>Moriah</i>30, part 5–7, pp. 19–21, 2010.)</i>. Explain it following Rebbi Eliezer, as Rebbi Eliezer said, in Tishre was the world created<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And therefore Noe’s years are not treated as regnal years; all years mentioned in the early history in <i>Gen</i>. start in Tishre. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Rosh Hashanah 10b\" href=\"/Rosh_Hashanah.10b\">Babli 10b</a>.</i>. But is it not written, <i>it was in the month of Nisan of year twenty</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Nehemiah 2:1\" href=\"/Nehemiah.2.1\"><i>Neh.</i>2:1</a>.</i>; <i>it was in the month of Kislew of year twenty</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Nehemiah 1:1\" href=\"/Nehemiah.1.1\"><i>Neh</i>. 1:1</a>. Nehemiah was informed in Kislew of year 20 of Artaxerxes of the sorry state of Jerusalem; in Nisan of the same year he asked permission to leave Susa and go to Jerusalem. The regnal year must have started in the fall.</i>? Explain it following Rebbi Eliezer, as Rebbi Eliezer said, any year of which 30 days have not elapsed is not counted as a full year. But is it not written<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 40:17\" href=\"/Exodus.40.17\"><i>Ex.</i> 40:17</a>.</i>, <i>It was in the first month of the second year, on the first of the month, when the Sanctuary was erected</i>? If you are saying that it was the third year and because 30 days had not elapsed it is not counted as a full year, is it not written<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Numbers 10:11\" href=\"/Numbers.10.11\"><i>Num</i>. 10:11</a> (misquoted). Since this verse refers to the service in the Tabernacle, it must refer to a time posterior to that quoted in the preceding verse; the statement in the name of R. Eliezer must be rejected. (In the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Rosh Hashanah 10b\" href=\"/Rosh_Hashanah.10b\">Babli 10b</a> the statement is formulated in a way which makes it not relevant to the case discussed here.)</i>, <i>it was in the second year in the second month, on the twentieth of the month</i>? There are 50 days in the year, and it would not be counted as a whole year? That is one of Rebbi Isaac’s answers which are difficult<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And the statement of R. Eleazar in the name of R. Ḥanina has to be rejected. The entire text of R. Isaac is copied by Tosaphot 3b, s. v. מניינא.</i>.",
                "What is the difference whether one says that one counts from Nisan or one counts from Tishre? Rebbi Jonah says, the difference is the proof power of documents<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Avodah Zarah 10a\" href=\"/Avodah_Zarah.10a\">Babli <i>Avodah zarah</i>10a</a>.</i>.

For him who said that one counts from Tishre, the sale preceded<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The property is free of encumbrances.</i>.",
                "How for kings? If he died in Adar and a king took office in Adar it is counted as a year for both of them. Rebbi Jonah said, only if he reached Nisan. Otherwise like the following, <i>he ruled one month in Samaria</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"II Kings 15:13\" href=\"/II_Kings.15.13\"><i>2K.</i> 15:13</a>.

You can determine the years of the kings of Israel only through the years of the kings of Jehudah, and you can determine the years of the kings of Jehudah only through the years of the kings of Israel<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since there were overlapping years at the start and end of each reign, and there might have been shifts between Western counting from Nisan and Eastern counting from Tishre, the correspondences given in <i>Kings</i> are necessary to establish the correct correspondences. This leaves uncertainty for the days of the united monarchy.</i>. It is written<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"I Kings 2:11\" href=\"/I_Kings.2.11\"><i>1K.</i> 2:11</a>.</i>: <i>And the time that David ruled over Israel was forty years</i>, etc. And it is written<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"II Samuel 5:4\" href=\"/II_Samuel.5.4\"><i>2S.</i>5:4</a>.

Rebbi Isaac bar Qaṣaṣata in the name of Rebbi Jonah: they were thirty-two and a half years, but to honor Jerusalem he counts them as entire.

                "Who stated “holidays”? Rebbi Simeon, since Rebbi Simeon said, “three holidays in order starting with the holiday of unleavened bread<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Why is it necessary to state that the holidays start in Nisan? If somebody makes a vow he incurs the obligation to fulfill his vow (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Deuteronomy 23:24\" href=\"/Deuteronomy.23.24\"><i>Deut</i>. 23:24</a>).

On the other hand, the blowing of the <i>shofar</i> is a duty imposed on the Court; it is not intrinsic to the notion of Jubilee.</i>. Another explanation: The blowing of the <i>shofar</i> depends on the Court but manumission of slaves depends on everybody<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">79</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Essentially a succinct reformulation of the previous argument.</i>.” And it follows what Rebbi Samuel ben Rav Isaac said, <i>the Eternal spoke to Moses and Aaron and commanded them to the Children of Israel</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">80</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 6:13\" href=\"/Exodus.6.13\"><i>Ex.</i> 6:13</a>.</i>.
