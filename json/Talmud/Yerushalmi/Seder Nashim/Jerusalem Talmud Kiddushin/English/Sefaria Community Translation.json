            "MISHNA: The woman is acquired in three ways and acquires herself in two ways. [She is] acquired with money, with a document and with intercourse. With money? Beit Shammai says: With a dinar, or the value of a dinar. And Beit Hillel says: With a perutah, or with the value of a perutah. And how much is a perutah [worth]? One eighth of the isser italki. She acquires herself with a get, or with the death of the husband. A yevama is acquired with intercourse, and acquires herself with chalitzah or with the death of [all available] yavam[s].",

            "[And you find that with our father] Avraham, that he kept the Torah even it had not yet come to the world, as it is stated: \"because that Avraham hearkened to my voice, and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws [Torahs].\" It elevated him and blessed him in his youth, and gave him posterity and hope in his old age. Regarding his youth, what does it say (Genesis 13:2): \"And Avram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.\" Regarding his old age, what does it say (Genesis 24:1): \"And Avraham was old , well stricken in age; and the Lord had blessed Avraham in all things.\" Rabbi Hezkiya, Rabbi Cohen in the name of Rav: It is forbidden to reside in a city that has no doctor, and where there is no bathhouse, and where the courthouse does not flog and imprison [criminals]. Rabbi Yosi ben Rabbi Bon: It is also forbidden to reside in a city where there is no vegetable garden. Rabbi Hezkiya, Rabbi Cohen in the name of Rav: In the future, a person will give a judgement and an accounting over everything that his eye saw and what he did not eat. Rabbi Elazar feared these laws and invested his money in order to eat from every kind [of vegetable] once a year. "
