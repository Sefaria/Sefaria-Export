What seems to be intended here is that ownerless property can be acquired by active actual possession (i. e., possession combined with use.) The idea seems to be that a woman, performing a wife’s duty in a man’s house, by this act should become his wife. The comparison is to a slave woman who belonged to a proselyte who failed to start a Jewish family and dies without heirs. Any Jew who gets hold of her and lets her perform a servile job for himself has acquired her in law.<br>A second meaning of חֲזָקָה is “permanence of the <i>status quo ante</i>,” cf. <i>Giṭṭin</i> 3:3, Notes 81,89; <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Nazir 9:2:8\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nazir.9.2.8\"><i>Nazir</i> 9:2, Note 90</a>. This meaning is referred to, somewhat incongruously, in the verse quoted at the end; property is inherited by the permanence of the state of “belonging to”.<br>A subcategory of “permanence of the <i>status quo ante</i>” is the validation of squatter’s rights after three years of undisturbed possession, if accompanied by a claim of rightful acquisition.</i>. Is it not logical that since a Gentile slave woman, who cannot be acquired by intercourse, can be acquired by actual possession, by an argument <i>de minore ad majus</i> a free woman, who can be acquired by intercourse, could be acquired by actual possession? The verse says, “and has marital relations with her.” She can be acquired by intercourse but cannot be acquired by actual possession. An argument <i>de minore ad majus</i> that a Gentile slave woman should be acquired by intercourse: Is it not logical that since a free woman, who cannot be acquired by actual possession, can be acquired by intercourse, by an argument <i>de minore ad majus</i> a Gentile slave woman, who can be acquired by actual possession, could be acquired by intercourse? The verse<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 25:46\" href=\"/Leviticus.25.46\"><i>Lev</i>. 25:46</a>.</i> says, “you may leave them as inheritance to your sons after you, to inherit them as property.” She is acquired by actual possession; she is not acquired by intercourse. So we inferred that a woman can be acquired in three ways: by money, or by document, or by intercourse.",

Talmudic theory identifies the biblical <i>šeqel</i> with the Roman tetradrachma, which is slightly more than the standard <i>šeqel</i> documented from First Kingdom times, 11.4 g. Since in the vernacular the <i>zūz</i>, the Babylonian half-<i>šeqel</i>, was identified with the Roman <i>denarius</i>, the “sheqel” was identified as two denar. This gave rise to the theory that the biblical “holy <i>šeqel</i>”, which simply was “the king’s weight” and still the Tyrian <i>šeqel</i> in Roman times, was twice the profane <i>šeqel</i>.

R. Ismael allows no more than one intermediate step between biblical text and legal statement.</i>. Following Rebbi Ismael who rejects combination of inferences? It was found that Rebbi Ismael stated: In the case of the word חֻפְשָׁה, “free” is inferred from חֻפְשָׁה<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">163</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The expression חפשי is used in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 21:2\" href=\"/Exodus.21.2\"><i>Ex</i>. 21:2</a>,<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 21:5\" href=\"/Exodus.21.5\">5</a> in reference to the male Hebrew slave. In R. Ismael’s opinion, the <i>ḥâruphah</i> slave girl is a former Gentile who needs manumission (Notes 147,148) and חֻפְשָׁה mentioned in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 19:20\" href=\"/Leviticus.19.20\"><i>Lev</i>. 19:20</a> is her bill of manumission. Since the Gentile slave girl can be manumitted by a document, it is concluded that the Hebrew slave can be acquired by a document. As noted later, this is a <i>non sequitur</i>.</i>. Everywhere Rebbi Ismael rejects combination of inferences and here, he accepts combination of inferences? Rebbi Ismael stated it in the name of the Sages<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">164</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This translation follows the sentence structure of A.</i>. From where is it derived for Rebbi Ismael? “Sending away, sending away.” Since “sending away” mentioned there means by a contract, also “sending away” here means by a contract<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">165</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Divorce, which requires a written document, is called “sending away” (of the wife) in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Deuteronomy 24:1\" href=\"/Deuteronomy.24.1\"><i>Deut</i>. 24:1</a>.

As noted immediately, this only would prove that the master can terminate the indenture by a written document, not that he could acquire the Hebrew’s services by a document.</i>.

Since the Gentile slave can be bought by contract (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 1:3:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.1.3.1\">Mishnah 3</a>), the Hebrew slave also can be bought by contract.

A Mishnah disagrees with Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish. “A man may contract a preliminary marriage for his adolescent daughter either by himself or by his agent.” He explains that following Rebbi Jehudah, since Rebbi Jehudah said, “no two hands can acquire together.” Rebbi Yose said, a rabbi came out from the assembly and said, a case was decided following Rebbi Joḥanan.

The treatment of this topic in the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Kiddushin 45b\" href=\"/Kiddushin.45b\">Babli, 45b</a>, is not comparable to the argument here since the Babli distinguishes between a marriage in the presence of the father and one contracted when the father was on a far away trip.

If she was preliminarily married without agreement and definitively married without agreement, may she eat heave?

Come and see: If she was preliminarily married with agreement and definitively married without agreement, Samuel says that she may not eat; here he says she may eat? Samuel treats her as an orphan<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since everything was done without consulting the father, one may assume that the latter would have indicated his disapproval had he disapproved. His silence therefore is considered as formal approval and the underage girl is emancipated from him; she becomes “an orphan during the father’s lifetime” (cf. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 6:1:3\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.6.1.3\"><i>Giṭṭin</i> 6:1, Note 20</a>).

Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Simeon says in the name of Rebbi Meïr, a loan is like a deposit: If there was a <i>peruṭah</i>’s worth left, she is preliminarily married; otherwise, she is not preliminarily married.” Rebbi Eleazar said, Rebbi Simeon ben Eleazar follows Rebbi Meïr<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In asserting that <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 2:1:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.2.1.1\">Mishnah 2:1</a> follows R.

If raw wool was given to the dyer to be died red and he died it black, for R. Meïr the dyer acquired the wool as a robber and has to pay the value of the raw wool to his client. R. Jehudah holds that the wool remains the property of the consignor but the dyer is paid only an amount which protects the consignor from loss. (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Bava Kamma 9:5:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Kamma.9.5.1\">Mishnah <i>Baba qama</i> 9:6</a>)</i>, so Rebbi Simeon ben Eleazar says here, anybody who deviates from the orders of the owner is called a robber. For he explains it<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Tosephta quoted from 1:2.</i> to be for a loan when the lender said<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">72</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It would be natural to read the text as לוֹוֶה “the borrower”.

If לווה is read as a verbal noun derived from <i>pi</i>‘<i>el</i>, parallel to Babylonian מַלְוֶה, everything becomes simple.</i>, buy wheat for me, but he bought barley for him<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">73</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Simeon ben Eleazar follows R. Meïr only in a very special case. He will agree in general with the anonymous majority that forgiving a loan represents enough monetary value to create a valid marriage. He only holds that if the borrower violated the terms of the loan, there no longer exists a loan but rather lender’s money in the borrower’s hand, i. e., a deposit.</i>. That is difficult: can one pay for a preliminary marriage with robbed money? Rebbi Yose asked: One understands that a person may invest a <i>peruṭah</i> to gain a denar; would he invest a <i>peruṭah</i> to gain a <i>perutah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">74</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This question is asked against R. Meïr’s position in general. It is understandable that for the anonymous majority the woman is married, since the profit she gains from not having to repay the entire loan is certainly worth an extra <i>peruṭah</i>. Therefore, even if we note that a loan was given to be spent and cannot retroactively be given as a marriage present, the additional profit for the woman makes her marriage worthwhile. But for R. Meïr, who holds that only the unspent part of the loan can be a marriage gift, there is no additional profit for the woman and one may ask why R. Meïr does not have a general statement that forgiving a loan can never be a valid marriage present.</i>? Some Tannaïm state: One may preliminarily marry with a robbed item; some Tannaïm state: One cannot preliminarily marry with a robbed item. Rebbi Mana said, the one who said that one may preliminarily marry with a robbed item refers to an item which he has a chance to recoup from her hand. The one who said that one cannot preliminarily marry with a robbed item refers to an item which he has no chance to remove from her hand<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">75</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He refers to the situation described by R. Eleazar, that the loan given to the woman turned into robbed property in her hand. If the prospective groom has documents to prove his case in court, the woman is a robber and he has a good chance to recoup his property in court, he offers her real value and the marriage is valid. But if all he has is a moral claim, that has no monetary value and cannot be used as a marriage present.</i>. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun in the name of Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac: the one who said that one may preliminarily marry with a robbed item refers to an item which the owner gave up hope to recover. The one who said that one cannot preliminarily marry with a robbed item refers to an item which the owner did not give up hope to recover<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">76</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This opinion does not disagree with R. Mana’s but refers to a different situation: The man is a robber and offers his prospective bride an object which he obtained by robbery. He can use the object for a preliminary marriage if and only if it is his both in ownership and in possession. The robber, who is in possession by the act of robbing, becomes owner at the moment the prior owners give up hope of recovery (cf. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 4:4:6\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.4.4.6\"><i>Giṭṭin</i> 4:4 Note 88, 5:6 Note 169</a>).</i>.",

                "<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If a man performs preliminary marriage using <i>‘orlah</i>, or <i>kilaim</i> of a vineyard,” etc. The first-born of a she-ass, Rebbi Eleazar said, may be used to preliminarily marry a woman; Rebbi Joḥanan said, it may not be used to preliminarily marry a woman. Rebbi Immi in the name of Rebbi Eleazar: The first-born of a she-ass may be used to preliminarily marry a woman by an argument <i>de minore ad majus</i>. Since you say that a firstling, whose prohibition cannot be lifted during its lifetime, can be used to preliminarily marry a woman, this one, whose prohibition can be lifted during its lifetime, not so much more<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">221</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The firstlings of cattle, sheep, or goats (the animals admitted to the altar) must be given to a Cohen. If without blemish, the animal must be sacrificed and eaten by Cohanim. If blemished, it remains the property of the Cohen and may be eaten by any Jew. In both cases, the living animal cannot be used for any work. The only use permitted is as sanctified or profane food; as far as use goes it is forbidden during its lifetime and becomes permitted by slaughter. But the firstling of a she-ass is supposed to be redeemed by the gift of a lamb to a Cohen; by this act, the donkey becomes totally profane and can be put to work immediately.</i>? What is the difference between them<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">222</sup><i class=\"footnote\">What additional differences does one find between Rabbis Eleazar and Joḥanan?</i>?

A <i>baraita</i> supports Rebbi Eleazar and disagrees with him.

Rebbi Eleazar explained that, after breaking of [the foal’s] neck. For Rebbi Eleazar said, everybody agrees that after its neck was broken it cannot be redeemed<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">230</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If the owner prefers to break the neck of his firstling donkey rather than give a lamb to a Cohen, R. Eleazar agrees that by this act he has lost his ownership and the carcass is forbidden for any usufruct. The Babli agrees in the name of Babylonian authorities, 57b; <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Bekhorot 10b\" href=\"/Bekhorot.10b\"><i>Bekhorot</i> 10b</a>.</i>.",
                "<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">231</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a new <i>baraita</i>; in slightly different formulation it appears in the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Bekhorot 10b-11a\" href=\"/Bekhorot.10b-11a\">Babli, <i>Bekhorot</i> 10b–11a</a>.</i>“One may not use the first-born of a she-ass to preliminarily marry a woman, but Rebbi Simeon permits it.” That disagrees with Rebbi Eleazar in two respects. If during its lifetime, it disagrees following the rabbis; if after breaking the neck, it disagrees following Rebbi Simeon<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">232</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>baraita</i> does not specify the status of the firstling. It is clear that after redemption the firstling is profane and can be used as a marriage gift. If the <i>baraita</i> speaks of the living unredeemed firstling, it contradicts R. Eleazar’s statement that it can be given as marriage gift. If it refers to the dead firstling, the assertion that R. Simeon permits its use contradicts the statement that everybody prohibits the dead fistling.</i>. Rebbi Ḥanina in the name of Rebbi Yudan: Explain it that it died<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">233</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It died a natural death before being redeemed. In this version, R. Simeon will agree that usufruct is forbidden after its neck was broken. This is the Babli’s explanation, <i>loc</i>.<i>cit</i>. Note 230.</i>. If he broke its neck, it is forbidden for usufruct, but Rebbi Simeon permits it. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">234</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A new <i>baraita</i>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Bekhorot 10b\" href=\"/Bekhorot.10b\">Babli <i>Bekhorot</i>10b</a>; <i>Mekhilta dR</i>.<i>Ismael Pisḥa</i> 18 (Horovitz-Rabin p. 71); <i>Mekhilta dR</i>.<i>Simeon ben Ioḥai</i> 13:13 (Epstein-Melamed p. 43). Then the comparison is between breaking the neck of the firstling and of the calf which atones for an unsolved murder. Since the calf has to be buried and its grave is forbidden for all usufruct (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Sotah 9:5:10\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sotah.9.5.10\"><i>Soṭah</i> 9:5, Note 132</a>) it is clear that the carcass itself is forbidden for all usufruct.</i>“Breaking the neck, breaking the neck.” Since “breaking the neck” mentioned there implies that one has to break its neck, bury it, and it is forbidden for usufruct, so “breaking of the neck” mentioned here implies that one has to break its neck, [bury it,]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">235</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Added from all parallel sources and a Genizah fragment.</i> and it is forbidden for usufruct. Following Rebbi Eleazar it is understandable. He permits during its lifetime; he needs an argument to forbid it after the breaking of the neck. Following Rebbi Joḥanan it is difficult. If it is forbidden during its lifetime, not so much more after breaking of its neck? There came Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan, Rebbi Ze‘ira in the name of the rabbis: It is needed following the rabbis, lest you say that since the Torah combined the breaking of its neck with its redemption<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">236</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The prohibition of usufruct of the firstling after its neck was broken is far from clear from the biblical text. Redemption by a lamb or breaking the neck are mentioned in the same verse (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 13:13\" href=\"/Exodus.13.13\"><i>Ex</i>. 13:13</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 34:20\" href=\"/Exodus.34.20\">34:20</a>); one might assume that both follow the same rule. The same explanation is given in the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Bekhorot 10b\" href=\"/Bekhorot.10b\">Babli, <i>Bekhorot</i> 10b</a>.</i>, and its redemption makes it profane, so also the breaking of its neck should make it profane<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">236a</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A Genizah fragment adds here:<br>לפם כן צרך מימר עריפה ער' וגו'. ר' יעקב בר אחא בש' רב י.. ... שמעון את חכמין. <br> Therefore it was necessary to say \"breaking the neck, breaking the neck.\" R. Jacob bar Aha in the name of Reb[bi] Y[ohanan].... one understands this for the Sages.<br>The text seems to be redundant; its omission in the Leiden text may be original.</i>. Do we find anything whose lifting makes profane and which is forbidden for usufruct<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">237</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This challenges R. Joḥanan’s position that the living unredeemed firstling is forbidden for ususfruct. In comparable cases, untithed produce (<i>ṭevel)</i> or sacrificial animals which developed a blemish, redemption transfers holiness to the redeeming object. But in the case of the donkey both it and the redeeming lamb are totally profane.</i>? They objected: There is <i>ṭevel</i> containing the tithe of the poor<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">238</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In general, <i>ṭevel</i> is produce from which either the required heave or the tithe was not taken; its consumption is sinful. The tithe of the poor is due in the third and sixth years of a Sabbatical cycle, when no Second Tithe is due. Its only claim to biblical status is from <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Deuteronomy 14:28\" href=\"/Deuteronomy.14.28\"><i>Deut</i>. 14:28</a>. Second Tithe, which must be eaten near the Sanctuary, has a status of holiness; produce from which Second Tithe was not taken is recognized as <i>ṭevel</i>(<i>Ma‘aser Šeni</i> 3:5, Notes 61ff.) But the tithe of the poor is totally profane; produce from which this tithe was not taken is referred to as <i>ṭevel</i> only here.</i> which becomes totally profane by its lifting; but Rebbi Abba, Rav Huna said in the name of Rebbi<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">239</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It seems that one should read “Rav” instead of “Rebbi”.</i>: A person eating produce which is <i>ṭevel</i> for the tithe of the poor is guilty of a deadly sin. The rabbis of Caesarea in the name of Rebbi Jeremiah: So the rabbis answer Rebbi Simeon: Do we find anything that needs redemption and is permitted for usufruct<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">240</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Any dedicated animals which become disqualified as sacrifices are forbidden for all use before being redeemed.</i>? He replied to them: There is the first-born human who needs redemption and is permitted for usufruct<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">241</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A first-born human male whose father did not redeem him by giving five <i>Šeqalim</i> to a Cohen must redeem himself when adult, but nowhere is there any restriction on his earning power before redemption.</i>.",
                "“If he sells any of these items and uses their proceeds for preliminary marriage, he is married.” Rebbi Ḥaggai in the name of Rebbi Ze‘ira: Because it is not its proceeds. Rebbi Ḥanina said, this means that one cannot marry preliminary with [the proceeds of] robbery<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">242</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This paragraph is quoted by Rosh (<i>Qiddušin</i> 2, #31) as follows:<br>רִבִּי חַגַּי בְשֵׁם רְבִּי זְעִירי, שֶׁאֵין תוֹפְסִין דְּמֵיהֶן. אָמַר רַבִּי חֲנִינָא, זֹּאת אוֹמֶרֶת שֶׁמְּקַדְּשִׁין בְּגְזֵילָה . \"Rebbi Haggai in the name of Rebbi Ze‘iri: Because (the prohibition of usufruct) is not transferred to its proceeds. Rebbi Hanina said, this means that one can marry preliminarly with (the proceeds of) robbery.\"<br>However, Ran (<i>Novellae Baba meṣi‘a</i>7:1), Rashba (<i>Novellae ad</i> 57b), Ritba (<i>Novellae ad</i> 56b), and Meïri (<i>Bet Habeḥira Qiddušin</i>, ed. A Sopher, p. 261) all read the statement of R. Ḥaggai in the version of the Leiden ms. but that of R. Ḥanina in the version of Rosh. [It seems that most authors did not have access to the Yerushalmi but copied from Ran (R. Nissim Gerondi); they cannot be counted as independent sources.] His arguments and those of the other medieval authorities are discussed in great detail and at length by J. Rosanes (<i>Mishneh Lammelekh</i>, Maimonides <i>Hilkhot Iššut</i> 5:7)]. In the opinion of the Babli (Rashi <i>Ḥulin</i> 4a, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Avodah Zarah 54a\" href=\"/Avodah_Zarah.54a\"><i>‘Avodah zarah</i> 54a</a>), the prohibition of usufruct is not transferred to the (illegitimate) proceeds except in the cases of idols and Sabbatical produce. However, our ms. sources (including the Constantinople print edition) do not support Ran’s reading of R. Ḥanina; one has to accept the ms. reading as it stands.<br>The statement of R. Ḥaggai is straightforward and was explained by Ran. Since objects forbidden for usufruct are worthless, the money received by the seller was not payment for the object. Since it was necessary to point out that the marriage was valid, it follows that if the money had been given in exchange for an object acquired unlawfully, the marriage would be invalid.</i>."

Since by tradition the diameter of the encampment of the Israelites in the desert was 12 <i>mil</i>, 24’000 cubits (<i>Shevi‘it</i> 6:1, Note 28), and certainly the Israelites were able to freely move in their camp on the Sabbath, it is clear that the restriction to 2’000 cubits is purely rabbinical. Therefore, it is open to manipulation. One of the accepted ways of manipulation is for a person to deposit some food, the ‘<i>eruv</i>, at the border of the permitted domain and declare that he intends to consider the place of that food as dwelling for the coming Sabbath. Then he still can move freely in the built-up domain, which is counted only as 4 cubits, but he has an additional 2’000 cubits on the other side of the ‘<i>eruv</i>, but nothing on the opposite side of the built-up area. Mishnah ‘<i>Eruvin</i> 3:5 permits a person to prepare a number of ‘<i>eruvin</i> which are mutually exclusive, and say: “If attackers appear in the East, my ‘<i>eruv</i> in the West shall be active; if they appear in the West, my <i>‘eruv</i> in the East shall be active; if there is no danger, I shall be like the other inhabitants of my place.”</i>” So is the Mishnah: “A person can impose a condition of his<i>‘eruvin</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">120</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since there are at least two.

In the case of the Mishnah, the bill of divorce would be for the mother; the daughter is not mentioned in the discussion. Rav, the teacher of R. Ḥuna, states that if he gave the bill of divorce on his own initiative, one can force him to pay the divorce settlement required by the law of <i>ketubah</i>.</i>.

Assuming that the man either is reasonably well trained in the law or has access to legal advice, he can avoid being badgered into offering a bill of divorce and then forced to pay a hefty sum by threatening to marry the woman’s sister. Since the Mishnah permits him to marry the sister, one cannot ask him to give a divorce to his sister-in-law since by that act he would prohibit his prospective wife to himself. It is in the interest of the woman desiring the bill of divorce to make it clear that she has no monetary claims. (Explanation of D. Fraenckel.)<br>The last sentence cannot be read as declarative: “one forces the divorce of the certain because of the doubtful”, meaning that the man would be barred from marrying the sister because of the unproven claim of the woman, since this would contradict both the Mishnah which permits the woman’s relatives to the man, and the general principle that in marriage matters only those statements count which can be backed up by the testimony of two witnesses.

In the Pentateuch, to which the verses clearly are referring, masoretic vocalization strictly differentiates between the noun קֳדָשִׁים “<i>sancta</i>, sacrifices” and the superlative adjective קָדָשִׁים “most holy”. Since the mss. of the Ben-Asher tradition uniformly write קֳדָשִׁים in the verse here, it is clear that the masoretic interpretation of the verse forbade <i>all</i> holy food to the desecrated priests, whether Temple sacrifices or “outside <i>sancta</i>”, i. e., heave and tithes. But the Yerushalmi, based on the Mishnaic distinction between קָדְשֵׁי קָדָשִׁים “most holy sacrifices”, destined exclusively for the altar and/or legitimate priests in the Temple precinct, קֳדָשִׁם קַלִּים “simple sacrifices” (well-being offerings) shared between altar, priests, and the donor’s family, and קָדְשֵׁי הַגְּבוּל “outside <i>sancta</i>”, here reads מִקָּדְשֵׁי הַקָּדָשִׁים “from most holy sacrifices.” This immediately raises the question why desecrated priests are not summarily excluded from <i>all</i> holy food (as they are in rabbinic practice).
