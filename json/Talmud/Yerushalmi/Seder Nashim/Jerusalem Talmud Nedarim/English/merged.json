                "<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> All substitute names<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since vows and oaths are sacral acts, the invocation of vow or oath is automatically the invocation of God’s Name. Just as God’s Name should not be invoked in vain, the people shied away from using the expressions “vow, making a vow” or “oath, swearing”. As explained in the next Note, one of the oblique references to a vow was the word <i>qorbān</i> and its substitute, as given in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 1:2:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.1.2.1\">Mishnah 2</a>.</i> of vows<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Making a vow is taking on an obligation. There are three kinds of vows found in talmudic literature.<br>A person may vow to bring a sacrifice or to give a certain sum to the Temple. This is a relatively simple matter since (Mishnah <i>Qiddšin</i> 1:6) “speaking to Higher Powers is like delivering to a human”; i. e., a promise to God is as final as delivering the merchandise in a commercial transaction. Therefore, these vows are only a minor topic in the present tractate.<br>A person may make a vow to become a <i>nazir</i> for a certain time; then he is required to abstain from grapes and grape products as well as from becoming impure by the impurity of the dead, and he must let his hair grow. This kind of vow is discussed in Tractate <i>Nazir.</i><br>The main topic of Tractate <i>Nedarim</i> is “any vow or oath of prohibition to deprive oneself” (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Numbers 30:14\" href=\"/Numbers.30.14\"><i>Num.</i> 30:14</a>), i. e., a vow in which a person for any reason prohibits to himself things which otherwise are permitted. One may also make a vow to forbid certain actions to oneself but the actions must be forbidden as things are forbidden. (Self-flagellation is forbidden in Judaism since inflicting any wound on oneself is forbidden except for medical purposes, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Bava Kamma 8:4:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Kamma.8.4.1\">Mishnah <i>Baba qama</i> 8:5</a>.) Since an animal which was dedicated as a sacrifice is forbidden for any profane use, it became general practice to say about anything of which one wanted to prohibit all use for himself “this is <i>qorbān</i> for me”, or simply <i>qorbān</i> “sacrifice”. Therefore, if in <i>Math.</i> 15:5 it is noted that a son can say to his parents that all he possesses should be <i>qorbān</i> for them; on the surface it is the height of mistreatment of the parents if the son prohibits them any use whatsoever of his property and even prohibits himself to help his parents in any way. The rabbinic answer would be that if the son goes off to fight as a guerilla against the Romans, or the Herodian government, cutting off all ties might save his parents’ property from confiscation. (Cf. <i>Peah</i> 1:1, Note 113, about the unpredictability of the duty to honor father and mother: “Somebody might serve his father fattened meat and go to hell; another might bind his father to the grindstone and go to paradise.”) The vow could also be in error, cf. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 3:2:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.3.2.1\">Mishnah 3:2</a>. Chapter 4 shows that a person forbidding his property to another can nevertheless take care of that other person. Cf. also <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 9:1:8\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.9.1.8\">Chapter 9, Note 38</a>.<br>{In <i>Math.</i> 15:5, Jesus complains that Pharisees declare a person free from prosecution (פָּטוּר) if he violates the commandment to honor and fear father and mother by maliciously forbidding his property to them. The pharisaic rule in question is that “a prohibition violated without an action is not prosecutable” (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Sanhedrin 63\" href=\"/Sanhedrin.63\">Babli <i>Sanhedrin</i> 63a/b</a>). Speech is not counted as an action in this respect. The rule is opposed by R. Jehudah who in many cases represents older traditions (from his father’s teacher R. Eliezer.) The testimony of <i>Math</i>. shows that in this case, the majority opinion is the historic position. R. Jehudah’s position is that of the Qumran community in the Manual of Discipline and the Damascus Document.}</i> are like vows, of bans<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Ban” is the irrevocable gift of property to the Temple, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 27:28\" href=\"/Leviticus.27.28\"><i>Lev</i>. 27:28</a>.</i> like bans, of oaths<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">An oath is subject-related, in contrast to a vow which is object-related. If a person prohibits himself to eat any bread, that is an oath of deprivation. If he prohibits the use of a specified loaf, or even any loaf, on himself, that is a vow of deprivation.</i> like oaths, of <i>nazir vows</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">While this is also a vow of deprivation it follows its own rules, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Numbers 6:1-21\" href=\"/Numbers.6.1-21\"><i>Num</i>. 6:1–21</a>.</i> like <i>nazir</i> vows. If one says to another, I am vowed away from you<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here starts the detailed explanation of what substitute names are. All expressions in this sentence are examples of נדר הנאה “a vow [to forbid] usufruct”, in which A tells B that all of B’s property is forbidden to A as if it were a sacrifice or sacred property and A’s property to B..</i>, I am separated from you, I am distanced from you, that I will not eat from yours, that I will not taste from yours, he is forbidden<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">All of B’s property, not only his food.</i>. I am excommunicated from you, Rabbi Aqiba was stringent in that because of a doubt<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Aqiba decided that, while the exact meaning of “excommunicated” in this context is unknown since the use of a judicial term by a private person is inappropriate, the most extensive interpretation must be adopted.</i>. As vows of the wicked, he vowed as <i>nazir,</i> a sacrifice, and an oath<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This sentence is very elliptic. Since the <i>nazir</i> prohibits vines and all their products for himself and he needs atonement for his status (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Numbers 6:11\" href=\"/Numbers.6.11\"><i>Num</i>. 6:11</a>) one concludes (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 1:1:2-3:7\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.1.1.2-3.7\"><i>Nedarim</i> 1:1</a>, 36d 1. 50; <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Nedarim 10a\" href=\"/Nedarim.10a\">Babli 10a</a>) that it is essentially sinful to deprive oneself from permitted enjoyments. It follows that just people do not make vows of deprivation or <i>nezirut</i>. They also do not make vows of sacrifices since such a vow implies that the person will be financially responsible until a correct sacrifice has been presented in the Temple. Responsible people offer free-will gifts in which they designate an animal as sacrifice; if anything should happen to that animal before it is sacrificed he is not obligated to offer a replacement.<br>Since the wicked do make vows and swear, any expression of vow or oath declared to be in the form used by the wicked has to be interpreted to imply a maximum obligation. Still, somebody who simply says that he makes a vow of the wicked is not obligated for anything unless some object on which the vow could fall was before him at that moment. For example, if a loaf of bread was before him and he said, this loaf is for me as a vow of the wicked, he is forbidden to eat that loaf. If a long-haired <i>nazir</i> was passing before him and he said, that is for me as a vow of the wicked, he is a <i>nazir</i> for the standard period of 30 days.</i>. As vows of the good ones, he did not say anything<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since good people do not make vows nor do they swear.</i>. As their freewill gifts<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If somebody said, this loaf of bread is to me as a free-will gift of a just person, he means that for him it is <i>qorbān</i> and therefore forbidden for all usufruct. Similarly, if a long-haired <i>nazir</i> was passing before him and he said, that is for me as a free-will gift of the just, he is a <i>nazir</i> for the standard period of 30 days.</i>, he made a vow of <i>nazir</i> and sacrifice.",
                "<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “All substitute names of vows are like vows,” etc. It is written<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Numbers 30:3\" href=\"/Numbers.30.3\"><i>Num.</i> 30:3</a>.</i> “Any person who vows,” why does the verse say “a vow”? From here that substitute names of vows are like vows. “Or he swears,” why does the verse say “an oath”? From here that substitute names of oaths are like oaths. “But any ban,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 27:28\" href=\"/Leviticus.27.28\"><i>Lev.</i> 27:28</a>.</i>” why does the verse say “which he bans”? From here that substitute names of bans are like bans. “A vow of <i>nazir</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Numbers 6:2\" href=\"/Numbers.6.2\"><i>Num.</i> 6:2</a>.</i>”, why does the verse say “to be a <i>nazir</i>”? From here that substitute names of <i>nazir</i> vows are like <i>nazir</i> vows. So far for Rebbi Aqiba who says that these are expressions of additions. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 8:1:12\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.8.1.12\"><i>Yebamot</i> 8:1, Note 72</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Avodah Zarah 27a\" href=\"/Avodah_Zarah.27a\">Babli <i>Avodah zarah</i> 27a</a> (and another 18 times without attribution). The quotes are from speeches of Laban and Joseph in <i>Gen</i>. which have no legal implications. This proves that the repetitions are a matter of style.</i> For Rebbi Ismael who said, these are double expressions in the normal style of the Torah, “going you went, desiring you desired, by stealing I was stolen”, from where? “<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Numbers 30:3\" href=\"/Numbers.30.3\"><i>Num.</i> 30:3</a>.</i> Any person who vows a vow to the Eternal or swears an oath to forbid a prohibition on himself shall not profane his word,” why does the verse say “he must fulfill anything coming out of his mouth”? From here that substitute names of vows are like vows and substitute names of oaths are like oaths<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The second half of the verse is clearly written for emphasis. It implies (a) that a vow is valid only if pronounced, not if only thought of and (b) that any speech which can be interpreted as a vow is a vow.<br>The <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Nedarim 3\" href=\"/Nedarim.3\">Babli, 3a/b</a>, quotes both the argument in the style of R. Aqiba and that of R. Ismael without mentioning any names.</i>. And from where that substitute names of bans are like bans? “A vow, a vow”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is an application of the second hermeneutical rule of <i>gezerah šawah</i> “equal cut”. If it was established in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Numbers 30:3\" href=\"/Numbers.30.3\"><i>Num</i>. 30:3</a> that “vow” means “anything that implies a vow” and in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 27:2\" href=\"/Leviticus.27.2\"><i>Lev</i>. 27:2</a> any dedication to the Temple, including bans, is classified as “vow”, it follows that anything which implies a ban is a ban.</i>. Since “a vow” at one place means that substitute names of vows are like vows and substitute names of oaths are like oaths, “a vow” at the other place means that substitute names of bans are like bans. And from where that substitute names of being a <i>nazir</i> are like being a <i>nazir</i>? “A vow, a vow”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Again this is an application of <i>gezerah šawah</i>, but this time the reference quote is <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Numbers 6:2\" href=\"/Numbers.6.2\"><i>Num</i>. 6:2</a>, cf. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 1:1:14\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.1.1.14\">Note 14</a>.</i>. Since “a vow” at one place means that substitute names of oaths are like oaths<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This reference is odd since the argument is about vows, not oaths. One has to assume that the scribe left out the relevant portion of the sentence which should be identical to the one used in the preceding case.</i>, “a vow” at the other place means that substitute names of being a <i>nazir</i> are like being a <i>nazir</i>.",
                "How does Rebbi Aqiba explain “he must fulfill anything coming out of his mouth”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If a vow cannot be fulfilled completely, it is not a vow.</i>? From here that if part of a vow is invalid, all of it is invalid. Does Rebbi Ismael not agree with this? Everything derives from there. It follows from there that substitute names of vows are like vows and substitute names of oaths<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That conclusion could have been drawn even if the word כל “all, anything” were not written. Therefore, the clause admits two conclusions independent of one another.</i> are like oaths and it follows from there that if part of a vow is invalid, all of it is invalid. How does Rebbi Ismael explain “any person who vows a vow of <i>nazir</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Numbers 6:2\" href=\"/Numbers.6.2\"><i>Num.</i> 6:2</a>.</i>”? From there that a person can obligate himself as <i>nazir</i> while he currently is a <i>nazir</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The pentateuchal state of <i>nazir</i> is always limited in time (when a Temple is in existence. Since a <i>nazir</i> is only permitted to drink wine after he has absolved the required Temple ritual, a person vowing to be a <i>nazir</i> today must remain in that state until the Temple is rebuilt and officiating Cohanim are found who have complete documentary proof of their priestly status going back to the priests officiating in the second Temple.) The prophetic state of <i>nazir</i>, as exemplified by Simson and Samuel, is unlimited but does not include a prohibition of the impurity of the dead. It is noted here that while a person is in the state of a <i>nazir</i> for a fixed period, he can undertake to be a <i>nazir</i> for an additional period, to begin after the Temple procedure for the current <i>nezirut</i> was performed. This statement is needed since the vow of <i>nazir</i> of an unincumbered person makes that person a <i>nazir</i> immediately upon pronouncing his vow.</i>. Does  Rebbi Aqiba not agree with this? He agrees and everything derives from there<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The same verse.</i>. He agrees that from there a person can obligate himself as <i>nazir</i> while he currently is a <i>nazir</i>.",

Therefore, substitute names which are in common use are as effective as the explicit mention of the word “ban”. But if an unspecified ban is intended for Cohanim (the majority opinion in Mishnah ‘<i>Arakhin</i> 8:6), the collection of the gift is a money transaction between Cohanim and the giver, subject to the rule that “the proof is on the claimant” (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Sanhedrin 3:8:2-8\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sanhedrin.3.8.2-8\"><i>Sanhedrin</i> 3:9</a>, 21b 1. 70; <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Bava Kamma 46b\" href=\"/Bava_Kamma.46b\">Babli <i>Baba qama</i> 46b</a>). The Cohanim would have to prove that the putative giver in his use of the substitute words really did intend to refer to bans. This proof seems almost impossible. Therefore, substitute bans could not be like bans and the Mishnah here must be interpreted as supporting the opinion that unspecified bans are for the Temple.</i>.

But if he swears that he will not fulfill his religious obligations, the oath is invalid since, in the language of the Babli, “he already is under oath from Mount Sinai”, and a valid oath cannot be superseded by another oath.

The Babylonian version differs from the Yerushalmi in that the lender asserts that he has only one spade which he needs for himself and only asserts that he has no spare and, most importantly, that the lying lender’s property is only forbidden to him during his lifetime but becomes the property of his heir while in the Yerushalmi the property becomes the Temple’s. Therefore, the position of the Babli is opposed to that of the Yerushalmi and every attempt to emend and explain the Yerushalmi in the light of the Babli falsifies the text.</i>: One said to another, lend me your spade<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">107</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In modern Hebrew, קרדום is an axe.

If he has a spade, his property would be forbidden for this one “has no spade”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">108</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He made a conditional vow. The vow must refer to an object. If he has no spade, there is nothing the vow refers to, and the vow is nonexistent. But should he have a spade, the vow refers to an object and is valid.</i>.

But if he abandoned only for a short time? Let us hear from the following: “If he abandoned his field, he may cancel his action during three days.” Rebbi Ze‘ira said, it says only “three days”. Therefore, after three days he may not cancel his action. Rebbi Simeon Dayana stated before Rebbi Ze‘ira: Even after three he may cancel his action. He said to him, since you say after three days, is it the same after three or after many? A <i>baraita</i> supports Rebbi Ze‘ira<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">125</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Nedarim 44a\" href=\"/Nedarim.44a\">Babli 44a</a>.</i>: “About when is this said?

But if he said: My field shall be abandoned one day, one week, one month, one year, a sabbatical period, as long as nobody took it over, either he or another person, he may cancel. But after somebody acquired it, either he or somebody else, he cannot cancel.” This means that short or long periods are the same. It also means that they were not worried about dishonesty.
