If one cannot be sure that all fine points of the rules of bills of divorce were followed, the court must have the possibility of examining the messenger about the details of the writing and signing of the document.</i> must be able to say: “It was written and signed before me.” Rabban Gamliel says, even somebody who brings from Reqam<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Two places “Reqam” are mentioned as border towns in Transjordan in the description of the borders of the Land of Israel; cf. <i>Ševi‘it</i> 6:1, Notes 47, 51.</i> and Ḥeger<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This place has not been identified; it is conjectured to be on the Southern border of the Land of Israel.</i>; Rebbi Eliezer says, even from Kefar Ludim to Lydda<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Which were close to one another but in different court districts.</i>; but the Sages say that the only one who has to be able to say that it was written and signed before him is one who brings from overseas or to overseas. One who brings from one province<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">While in Biblical Hebrew מדינה means “province”, in Talmudic usage the word often has the late hieroglyphic, and Arabic, meaning of “capital”.</i> to another overseas has to say that it was written and signed before him; Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel says, even from one district to the next.",
                "<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “Somebody who brings a bill of divorce from overseas,” etc. This is difficult. If somebody brings a gift document from overseas,would you require him to say, it was written and signed<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The form נחתם is that of most Mishnah mss. and of the Babli. The form נתחתם in the Mishnah is that of several Palestinian Mishnah mss.</i> before me? Rebbi Joshua ben Levi said, there is a difference because they are not conversant with the fine points of bills of divorce<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Gittin 2\" href=\"/Gittin.2\">Babli, 2a/2b</a>, it is pointed out that a bill of divorce has to be written for the woman to be divorced since the verse says (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Deuteronomy 24:1\" href=\"/Deuteronomy.24.1\"><i>Deut</i>. 24:1</a>): “He shall write <i>for her</i>”. While the text of the bill must mention the names of husband and wife, it cannot be ascertained from the text whether the scribe was instructed to write the text specifically for that woman; there must be a live witness available who can be examined about this point. A second opinion notes that the signatures of the witnesses themselves would need confirmation.</i>. Rebbi Joḥanan said, that is a leniency lest she sit abandoned<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Gittin 3a\" href=\"/Gittin.3a\">Babli, 3a</a>, this is an anonymous (unanimous) opinion. As explained in the sequel, if the husband could come later and claim the the bill of divorce was fake, no woman could ever remarry on a bill of divorce written far away for fear that her children from a second husband could retroactively be declared to be bastards; cf. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 10:1:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.10.1.1\">Mishnah <i>Yebamot</i> 10:1</a>.</i>. Is that a leniency? It is only a restriction, for if he does not say to her, it was written and signed before me, you do not permit her to remarry. Rebbi Yose said, the difficulty which you impose upon her at the beginning, that he is required to say, it was written and signed before me, makes it easy for her at the end. For if [the husband] would come and protest, his protest would be void. Rebbi Mana wanted to say, a protest other than the text of the bill<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">E. g., if the husband claims that he had attached a condition to the bill not provided for in the bill and that the condition was not satisfied. Since the condition was not presented to the court which oversaw the delivery of the document, it cannot be considered.</i>. But is a protest about the text of the bill a protest which has no validity<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He claims that the entire bill is fake or that there is an intrinsic defect which makes the entire document invalid.</i>? Even for a protest which has validity, said Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun, since you say that the reason for the difficulty which you impose upon her at the beginning, that he is required to say, it was signed before me, is to make it easy for her at the end, that if [the husband] would come and protest, his protest would be void; this means that there is no difference whether it is a protest not about the text of the bill or about the body of the bill, a protest which has no validity, or a protest which does have validity<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since there was a witness who was cross-examined about the validity of the bill, the husband cannot be admitted to testify since when he claims to be still the husband of his divorcee he declares himself a relative by marriage who is barred from acting as a witness for or against his wife.</i>! But should you worry that maybe be gave the bill to disqualified witnesses to sign<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The messenger who delivers the bill might not know that the witnesses either were relatives of one of the parties or convicted felons; their signatures would invalidate the document.</i>? Rebbi Abun said, he is not suspect to damage her before Heaven<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For if both the local court and the wife act in good faith, Heaven will absolve her but he has sinned. Cf. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 15:4:3\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.15.4.3\"><i>Yebamot</i> 15:4, Notes 92–93</a>.</i>. Before the court he is suspect to damage her. But since he knows that if he comes and protests his protest is void, he will choose qualified witnesses to sign.",
                "If [the bill of divorce] contained documentation of a gift and [the messenger] said, it was written and signed before me, is [the husband’s] protest about the gift void since it is void about the divorce<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The question presupposes that one follows R. Joḥanan’s opinion in the preceding paragraph. The messenger who delivers the bill of divorce is a single witness who cannot validate a monetary claim. But since by tradition he has the power to validate a bill of divorce and the delivery of the bill implies authorization of the divorcee to collect her <i>ketubah</i>, it follows that in matters of bills of divorce the single messenger has the power to validate money claims as long as they are included in or dependent upon the bill of divorce.</i>? Or, since his protest is void [only] about the divorce, is it valid about the gift<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since annulment of the special gift from the husband to his divorcee will not hinder her from remarrying, there seems to be no special reason why a single witness should make a money claim definitive.</i>? We have stated later: “Bills of divorce for wives and documents of manumission are equal in the rules of carrying and bringing.” If [the document of manumission] contained documentation of a gift and [the messenger] said, it was written and signed before me, is [the master’s] protest about the gift void since it is void about the manumission? Or since his protest is void [only] about the manumission, is it valid about the gift<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If the document of manumission was accepted by the local court at the point of delivery, the slave upon immersion in a <i>miqweh</i> became a full Jew. A Jew cannot be enslaved by a fellow Jew (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 25:42\" href=\"/Leviticus.25.42\"><i>Lev</i>. 25:42</a>). The reason why the master’s protest is void has nothing to do with monetary claims; there seems to be no reason why the master cannot disclaim the gift.</i>? If somebody signed all his property over to his slave<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This seems to have been a common occurrence in Roman society.</i>, you say that the gift is the document of manumission<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The essence of freedom is that a person is master of himself; the gift document transfers mastership of the slave to himself.</i>. How do you treat this? Is it a document of manumission and his protest is void or is it a gift and his protest is valid? This can be compared to the following: <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The following is from <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 11:5:2\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.11.5.2\"><i>Ketubot</i> 11:5</a>, explained in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 1:3:2-3\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.1.3.2-3\">Notes 97–102</a>, and <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Makkot 1:7:3\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Makkot.1.7.3\"><i>Makkot</i> 1:16</a>. The variant readings are given in <i>Ketubot</i>. The messenger who delivers the document of manumission, which in this case is a document about money matters, is believed as if he were a group of two in regard of the manumission but is disqualified for the money part. All the questions asked up to this point can be answered if one decides whether to follow R. Joḥanan or R. Simeon ben Laqish.</i> If somebody signed all his property over to two persons in one document and the testimony of the witnesses was valid for one but invalid for the other. Rebbi Ila in the name of Rebbi Immi<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Ketubot</i>: R. Yasa. Since rabbis Yasa (Assi) and Immi (Ammi) form a permanent pair in the Babli, there is no real difference in the attributions.</i>: Rebbi Joḥanan and Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish disagreed; one said, since it is invalid for one it is invalid for the other, but the other said, it is valid for one and invalid for the other. Rebbi Mana did not specify; Rebbi Abin specified: Rebbi Joḥanan said, since it is invalid for one it is invalid for the other; but Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, it is valid for one and invalid for the other. Rebbi Eleazar said, a Mishnah supports Rebbi Joḥanan: “Since testimony of two [witnesses] is invalid if one of them turns out to be related or disqualified, so also of three [witnesses] it is invalid if one of them turns out to be related or disqualified”. Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa said, Rebbi Ḥanina the colleague of the rabbis and the rabbis disagree. One says, the argument of Rebbi Eleazar is correct, but the other says, Rebbi Eleazar is not correct. For him who says, the argument of Rebbi Eleazar is correct, it is a testimony about one person; as testimony it is totally invalid if it is partially invalid. For him who says, the argument of Rebbi Eleazar is not correct, it is as if two groups of witnesses came, valid for one and disqualified for the other.",
                "Only if he says, it was written before me during the day and signed during the day<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“The day” means the day written as date in the document. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 2:2:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.2.2.1\">Mishnah 2:2</a> notes that a pre-dated bill of divorce is invalid like all pre-dated documents. The bill may have been written in the night and signed the following day since the rabbinic day is counted from sundown to sundown; it cannot have been written during daytime and signed the following night since that would make it pre-dated.</i>; only if he says, it was written before me especially for her and signed expressly for her<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The messenger must have heard the husband tell the scribe to write a bill of divorce for his wife, mentioning her by name. The <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Gittin 3a\" href=\"/Gittin.3a\">Babli agrees, 3a</a>.</i>. It was asked before Rebbi Joḥanan: Does he have to know the names of the witnesses at the moment of their signing? He said to them, did the Gentiles Luciani sign it<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If the names sound Roman, it does not mean anything. In the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Gittin 11b\" href=\"/Gittin.11b\">Babli, 11b</a>, R. Joḥanan notes that if a Gentile name is known to be used by Jews, the matter does not have to be investigated. Examples given in the Babli are Λύκος “wolf”, a frequent substitute for Benjamin (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Genesis 49:27\" href=\"/Genesis.49.27\"><i>Gen</i>. 49:27</a>), and Λίς “lion” (in epic poetry, cf. Semitic ליש), a substitute for Jehudah (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Genesis 49:9\" href=\"/Genesis.49.9\"><i>Gen</i>. 49:9</a>). Cf. E. and H. Guggenheimer, <i>Jewish Family Names and their Origins: An Etymological Dictionary</i> (Ktav, 1992; German edition <i>Etymologisches Wörterbuch der jüdischen Familiennamen</i>, Saur 1996), Introduction: Sobriquets, Animal Names.</i>? And you say so? A <i>baraita</i> supports Rebbi Joḥanan: “All bills of divorce coming from overseas are valid even if their names sound Gentile since Jews outside the Land of Israel bear Gentile names.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Gittin 11b\" href=\"/Gittin.11b\">Babli 11b</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Tosefta Gittin (Lieberman) 6:4\" href=\"/Tosefta_Gittin_(Lieberman).6.4\">Tosephta 6:4</a>.</i>” He said only, outside the Land; therefore not in the Land of Israel<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It should not be assumed that Jewish people with Gentile names cannot sign a bill of divorce in the Land of Israel; there are a number of rabbis with Gentile names such as Eudaimon, Pappos, Antigonos. But in case such a name appears, an inquiry has to be made about the identity of the witness, wheras in documents coming from outside the Land, all names are accepted without inquiry.</i>.

What about this? Even in a Jewish store<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The document must mention the place where it was written.

                "If he did not say: “it was written and signed before me”? Should not an Amora have asked this question? He said to him<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is unclear to whom this refers; the text seems defective.</i>, that is what Rabin ben Rav said: If he brought a bill of divorce, gave it to her, but did not tell her: “It was written and signed before me”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Is the bill of divorce invalid in this case? In the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Gittin 5b\" href=\"/Gittin.5b\">Babli, 5b</a>, Rabin bar Rav Ḥisda brought a bill of divorce before R. Joḥanan, who instructed him to deliver the bill in the presence of two witnesses and to make the required declaration. The question here can be interpreted to mean that Rabin asked whether the formality was really necessary in view of the fact, reported in the next paragraph, that R. Joshua ben Levi, of the generation of R. Joḥanan’s teachers, did not require the declaration. In the Babli, which is edited according to strict historical principles, R. Joshua ben Levi is mentioned before R. Joḥanan.</i>? There came a case before Rebbi Joḥanan, who said to him<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The messenger who had delivered the bill of divorce without making the required declaration.</i>, take it from her and say in front of two [witnesses]: “It was written and signed before me.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is understood that the Mishnah requires the declaration to be made either in the presence of two witnesses or at the local court. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Tosefta Gittin (Lieberman) 2:1\" href=\"/Tosefta_Gittin_(Lieberman).2.1\">Tosephta 2:1</a> permits the declaration to be made “even after three years” if the bill of divorce can be returned to the messenger.</i>” Does Rebbi Joḥanan follow Rebbi Simeon ben Eleazar, since Rebbi Simeon ben Eleazar said<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Tosefta Gittin (Lieberman) 6:1\" href=\"/Tosefta_Gittin_(Lieberman).6.1\">Tosephta 6:1</a>; a different version <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Gittin 78a\" href=\"/Gittin.78a\">Babli 78a</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Gittin 84b\" href=\"/Gittin.84b\">84b</a>. The statement refers to <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 8:2:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.8.2.1\">Mishnah 8:2</a>: “If he said to her, take this bond, or she took it out from his belt, and when she read it she realized that it was her bill of divorce, it is not a bill of divorce unless he says to her: This is your bill of divorce.” The reason is that <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Deuteronomy 24:1\" href=\"/Deuteronomy.24.1\"><i>Deut</i>. 24:1</a> requires that in a divorce the husband deliver the bill into the wife’s hand. The question arises whether the required declaration is valid after the bill is already in the wife’s hand. In the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Gittin 78a\" href=\"/Gittin.78a\">Babli 78a</a>, Rebbi is quoted as holding that the bill is invalid unless given as a bill of divorce; R. Simeon ben Eleazar permits the husband to reclaim the bill from his wife and deliver it a second time accompanied by the required declaration. In the Tosephta, Rebbi is reported not to require the declaration, R. Simeon ben Eleazar requires that the declaration accompany the delivery. The language of the Tosephta is that of the Yerushalmi; it is not clear whether R. Simeon ben Eleazar permits taking the document back.</i>, it is no bill of divorce unless he tells her at the moment of delivery that it is her bill of divorce? Can the position of Rebbi Joḥanan be derived from Rebbi Simeon ben Eleazar? Would Rebbi Simeon ben Eleazar agree that if he told her at the moment of delivery that it was her bill of divorce it would not be a bill of divorce<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The answer to this rhetorical question clearly is no; the only condition imposed by R. Simeon ben Eleazar is that the wife be informed of the nature of the document at the moment of delivery.</i>? But here, even if he tells her at the moment of delivery that it is her bill of divorce, it is no bill of divorce unless he tells her in front of two [witnesses]: “It was written and signed before me.” But Rebbi Joḥanan might hold that a woman cannot be believed if she says, I received a bill of divorce from my husband’s agents<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Therefore, the delivery of the document characterized as a bill of divorce must be made before two witnesses in good standing. It seems that in his case, the document was delivered in private; the main reason of R. Joḥanan was not the recitation of the formula but the delivery in front of witnesses.</i>. But we did state<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 2:6:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.2.6.1\">Mishnah 2:7</a>.

It is implied here that the act which makes the document valid is its <i>signing</i> by two reliable witnesses, not its <i>delivery</i>.</i>? How is it? The reason of Rebbi Joḥanan is to make her known as divorcee in front of two [witnesses]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He holds that the requirement of the declaration mentioned in the Mishnah is prescriptive but its omission does not invalidate the divorce.</i>.",

The word of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish implied that all are invalid since Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, if he wrote the essential text with the formula, it is invalid<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The sentence about R. Simeon ben Laqish is missing in the Geniza text. R. Simeon ben Laqish considers the statement that the document is one of divorce so important that its writing without the explicit instruction by the husband invalidates the bill; cf. Chapter 2, Notes 100,101. But his choice of the word “invalid”, not that “there is no ‘smell’ of a divorce”, shows that in all cases he holds that any material expression of the husband’s desire to divorce prohibits the Cohen to remain married to his wife.</i>. The word of Rebbi Joḥanan implied that none are invalid since Rebbi Joḥanan said, if he wrote the essential text with the formula, it is valid<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Joḥanan strictly follows the Mishnah that only the names of husband and wife and the date have to be written by the explicit instruction of the husband. Therefore, he also follows the language of the Mishnah, not that the bills of divorce are simply invalid but are “invalid to be used in divorce”, meaning that the use of any of these documents cannot imply any divorce in any form. (The classical commentators all feel obliged to switch the positions attributed to R. Simeon ben Laqish and R. Joḥanan; this position cannot be sustained against the testimony of both mss.) The <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Gittin 25a\" href=\"/Gittin.25a\">Babli, 25a</a>, quotes R. Joḥanan in the sense given here but explains his disagreement with the position attributed here to Rav by the fact that he never admits retroactive validation of documents; therefore, he cannot admit that the husband has the power to decide after the writing of the document to which wife it shall apply.</i>. Does the word of Rebbi Eleazar imply that none are invalid? Since Rebbi Eleazar asked: if one wrote a bill of preliminary marriage<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 1:1:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.1.1.1\">Mishnah <i>Qiddušin</i> 1:1</a> states that a preliminary marriage can be effected either by a transfer of valuables, or a contract, or sexual relations.

The document contains no formulaic text.</i>, does preliminary marriage take hold? If he had a problem with divorce, would he ask about preliminary marriage<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If he thought that any of the bills of divorce mentioned in the Mishnah would possibly count as active for a Cohen’s wife, he would have to ask about circumstances of divorce, where the problems are real and grave.</i>? Since in the case of divorce, where the document is required to be for a specific name and he did not write for a specific name, divorce will not touch her, is it not logical that in the case of preliminary marriage, where a specific name is not required and he did not write for a specific name, preliminary marriage take hold with her<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Geniza text has a longer argument: “Since he has a problem with divorce where [the documents] are not invalid; therefore he asks about preliminary marriage. If you say he has a problem with divorce, he should not ask about preliminary marriage. Since in the case of divorce, where it is required that the document be for a specific name and he did not write for a specific name, divorce did not touch her; in the case of preliminary marriage, where a specific name is not required, if it was not for a specific name preliminary marriage should take hold of her. It should be so. That is impossible. Since in the case of divorce, where it is required to be for a specific name, if it was not for a specific name, divorce did touch her; in the case of preliminary marriage, where a specific name is not required and he did not write for a specific name, preliminary marriage should take hold of her.” It is difficult to make coherent sense of this text.</i>? That should be obvious to him. Really, the following is obvious to him: Since one inferred the bill of preliminary marriage only from divorce<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The validity of a preliminary marriage by a symbolic bride purchase is given biblical status by reading <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Deuteronomy 24:1\" href=\"/Deuteronomy.24.1\"><i>Deut</i>. 24:1</a> “if a man take a wife” as “if a man buy a wife” since in Mishnaic Hebrew the verb לקח means “to buy” [<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 1:1:2-33\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.1.1.2-33\"><i>Qiddušin</i>1:1</a> (58b 1.35), <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Gittin 4b\" href=\"/Gittin.4b\">Babli 4b</a>].

Since leaving is effected by a document, so becoming can be effected by a document [<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 1:1:2-33\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.1.1.2-33\"><i>Qiddušin</i> 1:1</a> (58b 1.33), <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Gittin 9b\" href=\"/Gittin.9b\">Babli 9b</a>].

Rebbi Simeon declares them pure unless he designated them for impurity<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since a manufactured item only accepts impurity if it is used as a vessel or a tool, R.

D. Pardo, Commentary on the Tosephta, Part 4-1, ed. S. Lieberman, New York - Jerusalem 1970, p. 84). In the Tosephta, R.

It is now stated that the sale of the slave in form of a fictitious chattel mortgage (when the owner of the slave has no intention to repay the sum he received) is of questionable character; it would be valid if the owner had the intention of repaying the loan and taking back his slave since, as antichresis shows, the (temporary) transfer of possessions without transfer of ownership is perfectly legal.

The paragraph is difficult to understand; the commentators all emend the text to fit their explanations, which can be disregarded. It seems that the question is to whom do the heirs have to address their foreclosure document.<br>The problem is an old one; Meïri, after Rashi the second most important Medieval commentator, asked Rashba for an explanation (cf. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 5:3:4\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.5.3.4\">Note 64</a>). Meïri’s text read טרפו “his forclosure document,” Rashba’s read תרפו “his sales document.” This is Rashba’s anwer:<br>“It is my opinion that our text is defective and it should be as follows: Reuben robbed a field from Simeon and sold it to Levi, <i>then Reuben bought it from Simeon</i> but before he could write the sales contract, he died. That is the case about which Samuel asked Rav in (Babli) <i>Baba Meṣi‘a</i> (15b), viz., if it turns out that the field was not his, but he went and bought it from the original owners, what are the rules? He told him, the first (the robber) sold to the second (the buyer) any present and future rights to the parcel.… And this is the explanation of this text according to my understanding: Reuben had robbed a field from Simeon and sold it to Levi who did not realize that it was robbed. Afterwards, Reuben bought the parcel from Simeon, but Simeon had not yet written the sales contract when Reuben died: who is the owner? Rav Huna and Ḥiyya bar Rav: One says if the document was first, if the sale was completed before he died, the sale was final and Reuben did not transfer [the field] to Levi; this shows that Reuben did not intend to leave the field in Levi’s hands, ostensibly to leave it to his heirs. He does not spell this out since the sales document was not yet written. The other one said, there is no difference between written and not written, he wants the field to be Levi’s since he did not dispose of the field in a will. (The same Rav Huna and Ḥiyya bar Rav disagree in the Babli <i>Baba Meṣi‘a</i> (16a) about the time available to the robber to act to protect his credit.) Rebbi Mana has a different explanation: He says that in any case the field belongs to Reuben, following Rami bar Ḥama (in the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Bava Metzia 16a\" href=\"/Bava_Metzia.16a\">Babli, <i>Baba Meṣi‘a</i> 16a</a>) who said that Levi’s contract was not worth the paper it was written on. But Rebbi Yose bar Abun is of the opposite opinion, since Levi can tell him, is the field not now before you that you can turn the sale into a valid one. This follows Rava (in the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Bava Metzia 16a\" href=\"/Bava_Metzia.16a\">Babli, <i>Baba Meṣi‘a</i> 16a</a>) who told Rami bar Ḥama that Levi acquired the property by the trust he put in Reuben.<br>But following your reading, since you read טרפו with ט, it is possible that this refers to a foreclosure document which Levi obtained against the robber after he had lost the field to Simeon, and that is the same disagreement we find there (in the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Bava Metzia 16a\" href=\"/Bava_Metzia.16a\">Babli, <i>Baba Meṣi‘a</i> 16a</a>); how long does a person have credit, Rav says until the start of court proceedings, Ḥiyya bar Rav says, until the foreclosure document was signed, and Rav Papa said, until the public sale.”</i>? Rav Huna and Ḥiyya the son of Rav: One said, if he wrote the foreclosure document, it is Reuben’s, if not, it is Levi’s. The other one said, whether he wrote or did not write, it belongs to Levi. Rebbi Mana said, it is reasonable that it does not belong to Reuben since he can say to him, I sold you something which was not mine.

Since the prior argument showed that causing impurity is causing damage under the laws of torts, the person causing unintentional impurity should have to pay.

The strength of Rebbi Joḥanan comes from this: “If someone causes anything to become impure, or <i>dema‘</i>, or libation wine, if it was unintentional he is free, intentional he is obligated,” and Rebbi Joḥanan said, he pays a fine. A <i>baraita</i> supports Rebbi Joḥanan: “A person who puts a yoke on another’s cow is free in human law but guilty in Heaven’s law.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">131</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the times of the Temple, a red (probably meaning reddish-brown) cow without any black hair was worth millions (as material for the purification from the impurity of the dead, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Numbers 19\" href=\"/Numbers.19\"><i>Num</i>. 19</a>) provided it never was used for work and never wore a yoke.

The libation and the later mixing are two different acts. Even if there is only a libation, not followed by mixing with other wine, the libation can only be performed after the wine was poured into a vessel and the vessel lifted. Since we are speaking of wine belonging to a person other than the perpetrator, the latter becomes liable for all damages by lifting the vessel, some time before he commits the capital crime.

Gulak’s interpretation is difficult to square with <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Bikkurim 1:7:2\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bikkurim.1.7.2\">Mishnah <i>Bikkurim</i> 1:2</a>.}<br>A forced sale is intrinsically invalid since the seller can hope that in the future, when law and order are re-established, he may have a chance to appeal to a court and regain his property. But if a band of known <i>sicarii</i> give a property owner the choice of selling his land for a pittance or be killed together with his family, one may assume that he willingly gives the land to stay alive. In that situation, the land becomes the <i>siqarii</i>’s not only in possession but also in ownership, and may be sold by the current owner to any buyer. It is a matter of judgment of the court as to which situation does apply.</i> in Judea for those killed in the war<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">173</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“The war” refers to the revolt of Bar Kokhba and its aftermath, as shown by the parallel in <i>Ketubot</i> to the first sentences in the Halakhah. S. Lieberman (<i>Tosefta kiFshutah Giṭṭin</i> p. 844) has noted that the reading “R. Joshua” in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 5:7:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.5.7.1\">Mishnah 7</a> is clearly a scribal error since Rav, a student of Rebbi, states both in the Yerushalmi (Note 205) and the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Gittin 58b-59a\" href=\"/Gittin.58b-59a\">Babli (58b/59a</a>) that he himself was a member of the court relaxing the <i>siqariqon</i> rules. Also, the Halakhah never refers to R. Joshua or any of his contemporaries. Therefore, one has to read in the Mishnah, with all sources other than the Mishnah in the Yerushalmi, “Rebbi assembled a court” in the first quarter of the third Century, to deal with the problem of organized crime in his own day. Together with the rules about kidnappings, this shows that the forces of the Roman Empire (at least starting with the Severan dynasty) were barely able to guarantee the external, but not the internal, security of the Empire.<br>The Mishnah states that land taken from Jews during the war can be bought by anybody who has the means, without regard to any prior owner. (In this case, <i>sicarii</i> is a code name for Roman soldiers.) The Babli connects the Mishnah to a long string of tales about the first war against the Romans; this should not be taken as indication that the Mishnah refers to that war.</i>. After those killed in the war there was a law of <i>siqarii</i>. How is this? If one bought from a <i>siqarius</i> and afterwards from the original owner, his acquisition is void<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">174</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It was decided that the original owner retains claim to title even though he probably sold the land to save his life.

If one bought from a husband and afterwards from the wife, his acquisition is void<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">175</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The husband is not the owner of his wife’s (paraphernalia) properties, but their administrator. While the details of the sale must be contracted by the husband, prior consent of the wife is needed; otherwise, the husband is not authorized to deal and anything he agrees to is illegal.</i>; from the wife and afterwards from the husband, his acquisition is valid. This is the earlier Mishnah; a later court said that he who buys from a <i>siqarius</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">176</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Without needing prior consent. This is a regulation “for the public good”, to retain as much of the Land as possible in Jewish hands.</i> gives a quarter to the original owner.<br>When is this?

Rebbi (Joshua) assembled a court who voted that if it was in the <i>siqarius</i>’s hand for twelve months, any who wants to buy shall buy<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">178</sup><i class=\"footnote\">After 12 months, the original owner lost his right to regain the land.</i> and give a quarter to the original owner.",

One does not speak of a forced sale but of the rights of the heirs of a person who was killed and his land taken by Roman soldiers or civilians. It is clear that there was no sale. Since the greater part of the Jewish population of Judea was either killed in the war or deported as slaves, it made no sense for the organizers of the survivors to take notice of prior ownership. One has to assume that “Judea” means the Judean hills, to exclude the settlements in the plain centered around Lydda.</i>.” But are those killed before the war not like those killed after the war?

It is clear that the Mishnah text underlying the Yerushalmi is not the Mishnah of the ms. (which frequently represents a different tradition) but that of the <i>editio princeps</i> of the Mishnah (Napoli) and the Vienna ms. of the Tosephta: “If one bought from a wife and afterwards from her husband, his acquisition is void; from the husband and afterwards from his wife, his acquisition is valid.” S. Lieberman (<i>Tosefta ki-Fshutah Giṭṭin</i> p. 847) considers this reading as “incomprehensible” and, against his declared intention, does base his text on the Vienna ms. in this case. But it seems that the text can be well understood, since all depends on the legal status of the property, whether it is mortmain or paraphernalia (cf. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 7:1:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.7.1.1\"><i>Yebamot</i> 7:1, Note 1</a>). Mortmain is the husband’s property; at the dissolution of the marriage the wife is entitled to receive it or its value back; during the marriage all she has is a mortgage lien on her husband’s properties. Therefore, if she sells mortmain properties, she sells what she does not have; this is invalid. But if the husband sells, she has a right of regress on the property if it should turn out that the estate is insufficient to cover her <i>ketubah</i> claim. A buyer may want to buy insurance against such a possibility by paying the wife for her final assent to the sale. If she receives a consideration for her signature, she cannot claim later that she only signed to please her husband. The Mishnah speaks of paraphernalia property, which is the wife’s and of which the husband only has rights of administration.</i>. If there was one contract<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">197</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In that case, the buyer might not pay separately for the wife’s signature.</i>? Rebbi Ze‘ira and Rebbi Ila both say, certainly the sale is invalid; i. e., if he bought from the wife and then bought from the husband. Rebbi Ḥanina and Rebbi Bevon both said, certainly the sale is valid; i. e., if he bought from the husband and then bought from the wife.

In addition, from what Rebbi Yose and Rebbi Jacob bar Zavdi, Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan said, if somebody said to give a gift to another and he wants to retract, he may retract.

A woman appointed an agent to accept her bill of divorce from the husband’s agents. The case came before Rav, who said, if he wants to retract he cannot retract. Rav’s opinion has switched!

Ḥanina. Rabbinic practice follows R. Ḥanina. The Babli conjectures that a possible reason for Rav’s statement is that if the wife refuses to accept the bill from the husband’s agent but appoints her agent to receive the bill, she does this only to hinder the husband’s agent to fulfill his mission to deliver the bill to her. In that case, the wife would be entitled to appoint her agent if her appointment precedes her husband’s. Another conjectured reason is that there is a very remote possibility that things can go wrong if the bill is not actually delivered from hand to hand but deposited on her (or her agent’s) property. The basis for the possible complication is a rule which is not alluded to in the Yerushalmi and, therefore, should not be used to explain a statement in that Talmud.</i>, and here, he says so? I say, he was standing behind the door and heard her voice<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The relations between husband and wife were so bad that not only did the husband not want to deliver the bill to his wife who was nearby but the wife did not even want to receive it from the husband’s agent. Since the appointment of an agent by the husband under these circumstances was intended as an insult to his wife, her appointing her own agent was an adequate response. Since the husband was present during the entire proceedings, he must have agreed with his wife’s appointing her own attorney and there could be no reason to invalidate the proceedings. The statement of Rav Huna can be applied only to cases where not both parties are present.</i>."

The main attraction of the contractual marriage for the woman was that it provided insurance against foot-dragging by the groom (cf. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 13:5:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.13.5.1\">Mishnah <i>Ketubot</i> 13:5</a>).</i>: “I, X son of Y, contract a preliminary marriage with you, Z, daughter of U, on condition that I shall give you property A anddefinitively marry you by day B.

In the opinion of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish, what would be necessary? “If that day should pass without you having taken me in, I shall have no claim on you.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">138</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The condition has to be formulated not for the male, who actively has to take the woman in and therefore can claim unavoidable circumstances, but for the passive female. Since the contract is σύμφωνον, a mutual agreement, she gives her passive acceptance of the preliminary marriage only on condition that she be definitively married by a fixed date. If she refuses her agreement, no preliminary marriage is possible and no bill of divorce due.</i>” When Rebbi Joḥanan was dying, he told his daughters to act following Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish. He said, maybe in the future there might be a court which follows him; then his descendants might be in danger of bastardy<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">139</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If a woman contracts a preliminary marriage by the terms of R. Joḥanan’s formulation of the contract and is not married by the time specified because of unavoidable circumstances, and then contracts another marriage without a bill of divorce in the domain of jurisdiction of a court following R. Simeon ben Laqish, her children from the second marriage will be illegitimate if the first groom claims her as his wife.</i>.",

And you say, it is not roofed?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This refers to Mishnah and Halakhah <i>Šabbat</i> 11:1: “If somebody throws an object from a private domain to the public domain or from the public domain to a private domain, he is guilty. From a private to a private domain across the public domain, R. Aqiba declares him guilty but the Sages declare him not prosecutable.” It is then explained that throwing from the public to a private domain is prosecutable only if the object came to rest. On that it is noted that Rebbi does not require it to come to rest (only to be received within the walls), but R. Abba bar Huna in the name of Rav said that “Rebbi did only find him guilty if the private domain was roofed.” It is noted there that R. Joḥanan objected to the latter statement, which explains that no answer is given to the question raised.</i> What is the difference between bills of divorce and the Sabbath? Rebbi Abba said, about the Sabbath it is written: “You shall not do any work;” it may make itself automatically<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As long as it was not intended that the object should come to rest by the force of the thrower (but it was moved along by some mechanical contraption not directly controlled by the thrower), no violation of the Sabbath occured.

To one who told his wife, “this is your bill of divorce on condition that you sleep with Mr. X.” At the start, he is forbidden to have sexual relations with her.
