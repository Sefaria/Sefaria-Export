He is like somebody offering birds for the upkeep of the Temple<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The expression הֲרֵי עָלַי “I have to bring” is a regular form of a vow, which in Temple times implied a gift to the Temple. A single bird can be offered as a voluntary sacrifice (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 1:14-17\" href=\"/Leviticus.1.14-17\"><i>Lev</i>. 1:14–17</a>) but a couple can be given only as an obligatory sacrifice, i. e., a reparation or a purification sacrifice. These can never be given voluntarily, as result of a vow. Since the vow was formulated for <i>birds</i>, not <i>a bird</i>, it is concluded that the birds have to be given to the Temple for its upkeep, to be sold to persons needing them for obligatory sacrifices, with the proceeds given to the Temple treasury.</i>. What is Rebbi Meïr’s reason? He is like somebody offering a reparation sacrifice for the upkeep of the Temple<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is an impossibility; an obligatory sacrifice cannot be given voluntarily and it has to be offered on the altar, not sold for the Temple’s benefit. Therefore, the vow has to be interpreted as a wish to be in a situation in which one has to bring a reparation sacrifice to the Temple. The only reparation sacrifices which depend on the person’s initiative are either the possible sacrifice of the impure <i>nazir</i> or those required of the person guilty of larceny (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 5:14-16\" href=\"/Leviticus.5.14-16\"><i>Lev</i>. 5:14–16</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 21-26\" href=\"/Leviticus.21-26\">21–26</a>). Since it is impossible to think that a person should want to commit larceny for religious purposes, the state of <i>nazir</i> is the only alternative.</i>. What is the difference between them? If somebody says, “I take upon myself to bring a reparation sacrifice.” In the opinion of Rebbi Meïr he is a <i>nazir</i> since one cannot bring a reparation sacrifice for the upkeep of the Temple. In the opinion of the rabbis he is a <i>nazir</i> since an impure <i>nazir</i> brings a reparation sacrifice<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since in this formulation there is no difference between the rabbis and R. Meïr, all commentaries read “he is <i>not</i> a <i>nazir</i>”; since no person would accept <i>nezirut</i> with the prospect of an indefinite duration unless he spells this out clearly at the start, the vow is invalid because it is unrealistic. If one keeps the original wording, the rabbis and R. Meїr agree not only on the result but also on the reasoning behind it.</i>."

The rabbis have stated: A circular house, or one <i>digon, trigon, pentagon</i>, is not subject to the laws of leprosy of houses (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 14:33-53\" href=\"/Leviticus.14.33-53\"><i>Lev.</i> 14:33–53</a>); a house built <i>tetragon</i> is subject to those laws. (A text similar to the last sentence is in Tosefta <i>Nega‘im</i> 6:3; Mishnah <i>Nega‘im</i> 12:1 mentions only a round house and a <i>trigon</i> house.) In <i>Baba batra</i>, the word <i>digon</i> is further determined by the note that of the two consuls (<i>Archontes</i>), the one who is not eponymous is called <i>archon digon</i> (in the interpretation of the commentary ascribed to R. Gershom, a person “appointed <i>archon</i> for the second time”.)<br>Under the influence of the Babli, the dictionaries, starting with the 11th Cent. <i>Arukh</i>, have identified the words <i>digon, trigon, tetragon</i> used by Symmachos with the same words used in the Tosephta of <i>Nega‘im</i>. Now it is clear that in the latter Tosephta, <i>trigon</i> corresponds to τρίγωνος “triangular”, <i>tetragon</i> is τετράγωνος “quadrilateral, square”, and <i>pentagon</i> to πεντάγωνος “pentagonal”. In spherical geometry, there exists a notion of <i>digon</i>, but this cannot be traced back earlier than the 17th Cent.; it is a notion foreign to the spirit of Greek mathematics. S. Lieberman (<i>Tosefta kiFshutah Nazir</i> p. 504) has recognized correctly that a word δίγωνον does not exist in classical or Byzantine Greek. Therefore, the talmudic <i>digon</i> cannot be translated “bi-angular”. The word is more likely to be δίγονος “double, twin”, which certainly makes sense in the statements about <i>nazir</i> and <i>archon</i> (<i>archon digon</i> “associate <i>archon</i>”). In parallel, the words <i>trigon</i> and <i>tetragon</i> used for the <i>nazir’s</i> vow have well documented non-geometric meanings τρίγωνος “threefold”, τετράγωνος “fourfold”.<br>There only remains the problem of explaining the word <i>digon</i> used in Tosephta <i>Nega‘im</i>. It cannot mean “biangle” since a house with only two corners automatically must have curved walls and is excluded as a “round house”. Since “house” (at least in the Babli) as a rule means “one-room house”, it could be that the Tosephta excludes multi-room dwellings from the laws of the leprous house, referring here also to δίγονος.</i>: “<i>Tetragon</i>, four; <i>trigon</i>, three; <i>digon</i>, two.”",

He <i>may</i> shave his hair after 12 months, provided he offers the three prescribed sacrifices. But if he refers to the “number of hairs on his head”, he refers to a very great number of separate <i>neziriot</i>, and he can fulfill his obligation only by always offering his sacrifices at the earliest possible moment, after 30 days.

The sufferer from scale disease is required to shave before he immerses himself (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 14:9\" href=\"/Leviticus.14.9\"><i>Lev</i>. 14:9</a>).</i>. They said to him, the matter is settled. It cannot be counted for the days of his completeness, it cannot be counted for the days of his count. It cannot be counted for purification; it cannot be counted for impurity<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">151</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Probably one should read with Tosephta and Sifry: תַּקִּין הַדָּבָר. לֹא עוֹלֶה בִּימֵי גְמָרוֹ עוֹלֶה בִּימֵי סְפִירוֹ. לֹא עוֹלֶה בְטָהֵר עוֹלֶה בְטָמֵא. “It does not count in the days of his completeness; it counts in the days of his count. It does not count if [the <i>nazir</i>] is pure; it counts if he is impure.” The impure <i>nazir</i> shaves on the seventh day of his purification; this may be before he immerses himself. He has to shave before he brings his sacrifice on the eighth day. Therefore, a healed sufferer from scale disease who also is an impure <i>nazir</i> may combine his first shaving for his healing together with the shaving for his impure <i>nezirut</i>.</i>.

Eight days, the 30 day rule is waived for him, as they said: Sabbath is counted but does not interrupt, holidays interrupt but do not count.” If somebody was mourning for three days before the holiday, he does not have to continue the intense mourning period after the holiday; he continues with the remainder of the 30-day period. Similarly, if he was keeping at least one day of mourning after the seven-day period, the holiday cancels the remainder of the 30-day mourning period. (The <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Moed Katan 19b\" href=\"/Moed_Katan.19b\">Babli, <i>Mo‘ed qaṭan</i> 19b</a>, reduces the 8 day period to 7 since “part of a day is like a whole day” and the 30-day period starts on the seventh.)</i>: “Eight days, the decree of 30 days is waived for him.” The eighth has the same status as the 30<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">th</sup> day<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The argument here goes as follows: If the 8th day of mourning was holiday eve, the mourner can shave in the afternoon in preparation for the holiday.

Rebbi Yose said, there is a difference; there they permitted in order to honor the holiday.

Now everybody agrees that dedication in error is not punishable, but where do we find that intentional dedication should be punishable, to justify R. Yose ben R. Jehudah’s formulation?

In the case described, any Cohen can come and take the firstling from the altar and eat it (since only the blood of a firstling is given to the altar but nothing of its meat).

In general, the answer depends on what was unintentional. If a person does not know that today is Sabbath, for all he does wrong he owes one sacrifice. If he knows that it is Sabbath but forgot what is forbidden, he owes one sacrifice for each category of forbidden work. The problem is first whether this principle also applies to idolatry, the sacrifice for which is not described in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 4\" href=\"/Leviticus.4\"><i>Lev</i>. 4</a> but in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Numbers 15:22-26\" href=\"/Numbers.15.22-26\"><i>Num</i>. 15:22–26</a>, and second what is the status of the details enumerated in the Second Commandment, in particular why a detail, “do not prostrate yourself before them” is mentioned before the principle “do not serve them”.</i>{Before he broke<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reference to “breaking” here is a continuation of R.

Rebbi Abba bar Mamal said, for food imparting taste what is forbidden and what is permitted is not combined, but for the <i>nazir</i> forbidden and permitted do combine. A <i>baraita</i> supports one and a <i>baraita</i> supports the other. A <i>baraita</i> supports Rebbi Ze‘ira: If wine in the volume of an olive fell into a dish and he ate from it, he cannot be prosecuted unless he ate the entire dish. In the opinion of Rebbi Abba bar Mamal, if he ate the volume of an olive from it he is guilty. A <i>baraita</i> supports Rebbi Abba bar Mamal: “What do we understand when it is said (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Numbers 6:3\" href=\"/Numbers.6.3\"><i>Num</i>. 6:3</a>): ‘Anything in which grapes were soaked he shall not eat, and fresh or dried grape berries he shall not eat’?

But since it was said (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Numbers 6:4\" href=\"/Numbers.6.4\"><i>Num</i>. 6:4</a>): ‘anything made from the wine-vine, from grape skins to seeds he should not eat;’ (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Numbers 6:3\" href=\"/Numbers.6.3\"><i>Num</i>. 6:3</a>) ‘from wine and liquor he shall abstain.’ Why does the verse say ‘anything in which grapes were soaked he should not eat’? It means that if he soaked grapes and then soaked his bread in that, if it adds up to the volume of an olive, he is guilty. From here you argue about all prohibitions of the Torah. Since for all that comes from the vine, whose prohibition is neither permanent, nor a prohibition of usufruct, and whose prohibition can be lifted, He made taste like the thing itself; it is logical that for every prohibition of the Torah which is permanent, is a prohibition of usufruct, whose prohibition cannot be lifted, taste is treated like the thing itself. From here, the Sages inferred that everything imparting taste is forbidden.” This is difficult for Rebbi Ze‘ira: you say everywhere “unless he tasted<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">152</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The impure <i>nazir</i> cannot restart his vow if he left two hairs uncut.

But the Sages say, the <i>nazir</i> shall defile himself but the High Priest shall not defile himself. Rebbi Eliezer said to them, the Priest shall defile himself, who does not bring a sacrifice for his defilement, but the <i>nazir</i> shall not defile himself, who has to bring a sacrifice for his defilement. They told him, the <i>nazir</i> shall defile himself, whose holiness is temporary, but the Priest shall not defile himself, whose holiness is permanent.",

But if the power of the slave to vow as <i>nazir</i> be rabbinical, then there can be no biblical punishment for infraction. On this R. Mana notes that quasi-biblical status is not biblical status, and biblical punishment for non-biblical infractions (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Deuteronomy 25:4\" href=\"/Deuteronomy.25.4\"><i>Deut</i>. 25:4</a>) is impossible.<br>Therefore, the question is rephrased: If the power of the slave to enter into a state of <i>nazir</i> is biblical but the power of the master to force him to disregard his vow is only from practice, should the slave not be subject to prosecution for infringing his vow? The question is not to be taken seriously; it rather points out a logical inconsistency between the rule which allows the slave to become a <i>nazir</i> and the rule which allows the master to override, but not abolish, that vow.</i>.",
