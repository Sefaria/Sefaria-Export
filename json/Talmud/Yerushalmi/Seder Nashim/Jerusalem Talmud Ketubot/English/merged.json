                "<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> A virgin is married on Wednesday and a widow on Thursday, for in smaller towns court convenes two times per week, on Monday and Thursday, so if he has a complaint about virginity he can quickly go to court<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This reason, explored at length (and rejected) in the Halakhah, refers only to the marriage of the presumed virgin. For the widow, both Talmudim explain that the groom will have three days, the day of the wedding, Friday, and the Sabbath, to spend with his new wife. If he marries any other day, the groom might be expected to go to work the next day. In a metropolis one might expect to have the court available every working day.</i>",
                "<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “A virgin is married on Wednesday,” etc. Bar Qappara said, because a blessing is written there. But a blessing in only written on the Fifth and the Sixth days! On the Fifth for birds and fish<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The days of the week, which in Hebrew are simply numbered from 1 to 6, are identified with the Days of Creation. Fish and birds, created on the Fifth Day (Thursday) are blessed in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Genesis 1:22\" href=\"/Genesis.1.22\"><i>Gen</i>. 1:22</a>.</i>, on the Sixth for Adam and Eve<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Genesis 1:28\" href=\"/Genesis.1.28\"><i>Gen</i>. 1:28</a>.</i>. Rebbi Yose said, the reason of Bar Qappara is the Fourth, evening of the Fifth<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A couple which marries on Wednesday will first sleep together in the following night. Since the Jewish day starts at nightfall, this already is Thursday; they immediately benefit of the blessing to be fruitful and multiply. In the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Ketubot 5a\" href=\"/Ketubot.5a\">Babli, 5a</a>, this is a <i>baraita</i> in Bar Qappara’s name.</i>, and the Fifth, evening of the Sixth<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Ketubot 5a\" href=\"/Ketubot.5a\">Babli, 5a</a>, the explanation of R. Yose is part of the <i>baraita</i> attributed to Bar Qappara.</i>. Is there not a blessing written also on Sabbath<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Genesis 2:3\" href=\"/Genesis.2.3\"><i>Gen</i>. 2:3</a>.</i>? No blessing is written for creatures, only for the day.",
                "Because no blessing is written for creatures? Could she have been married on the Sabbath if a blessing were written for creatures? But was it not stated<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This <i>baraita</i> is stated in full in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 2:6:2-5\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.2.6.2-5\"><i>Berakhot</i> 2:6</a> (5b 1. 7), <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 1:10:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.1.10.1\">Note 261</a>.</i>: “A man should not first have sexual relations<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">With his virgin bride.</i> on the Sabbath, for he makes a wound.” It must follow “others”, for “others permit it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is part of the <i>baraita</i> text in <i>Berakhot</i>. In the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Ketubot 6b\" href=\"/Ketubot.6b\">Babli, <i>Ketubot</i> 6b</a>, the opinion of “others” is ascribed to “the Sages” and practice is decided following them.</i>” But “others” permit only when he is already married<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Meaning the final marriage ceremony in which the bride enters her husband’s house, which consists of the recitation of the “Seven Benedictions” in the presence of at least ten witnesses (cf. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 1:1:12\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.1.1.12\">Note 76</a>) after which the couple is considered married in all respects by being alone together. This ceremony activates all monetary aspects of the marriage contract.</i>, for before he was married he had no right to what she finds, what she earns<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In addition, the woman acquires the right to all services the husband is obligated to deliver in return for his acquisition of her property rights.</i>, and to dissolve her vows<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Without needing her father’s consent; cf. <i>Nedarim</i> Chapter 11.</i>. After he married her, he has the right to receive what she finds or earns, and to dissolve her vows. If you say so, he is like someone who acquires on the Sabbath<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Which is certainly forbidden by rabbinic standards, and, in the opinion of Isaiah, by biblical standards (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Isaiah 58:13\" href=\"/Isaiah.58.13\"><i>Is</i>. 58:13</a>).</i>. Rebbi Mana said, this means that those who marry a widow<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Who make the big wedding meal Friday night, to save the expenses of a separate Sabbath meal.</i> must take her in<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He must take her into his house before sunset to acquire his marital rights.<br>This sentence, which has no parallel in the Babli, is the source of an extensive rabbinic literature; cf. <i>Šulḥan ‘Arukh Even Ha‘ezer</i> 64:5. (In <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Tosafot on Yoma 13b:3:1\" href=\"/Tosafot_on_Yoma.13b.3.1\">Tosafot, <i>Yoma</i> 13b, <i>s</i>. <i>v</i>. לחדא</a>, the statement is quoted in the name of R. Ḥanina.) The question is whether the clause “to take her in”, is different from “entering the <i>ḥuppah</i>” used to describe the final marriage ceremony of a virgin. From Medieval times, <i>ḥuppah</i> denotes the canopy, open on all sides, under which the pair stands for the recitation of the “Seven Benedictions”. But there is no reason to assume that חוּפָּה originally meant anything but the totally covered bridal bedroom (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Psalms 19:6\" href=\"/Psalms.19.6\"><i>Ps</i>. 19:6</a>), from חפה “to cover”. There is no indication here that the rules of transfer of property rights are different for marriages of virgins and widows.</i> when it is still daytime on Friday, that he should not be like someone who acquires on the Sabbath.",
                "Rebbi Eleazar explains the reason given in the Mishnah, that if he has a complaint about virginity he can quickly go to court<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">His explanation is given later, by R. Hila. He insists that the Mishnah does not refer only to the fact that if he married a girl supposed to be a virgin and he found her lacking virginity that he can divorce her without paying but he can claim “erroneous acquisition” and ask the court to void the marriage without bill of divorce.</i>. A <i>baraita</i> supports Rebbi Eleazar: Since the time of danger<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Tosefta Ketubot (Lieberman) 1:1\" href=\"/Tosefta_Ketubot_(Lieberman).1.1\">Tosephta 1:1</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Ketubot 3b\" href=\"/Ketubot.3b\">Babli 3b</a>. As S. Lieberman points out (<i>Tosefta ki-Fshutah</i> vol. 6, p. 187), “danger” always refers to the persecutions after the war of Bar Kokhba, when Jewish observances were forbidden and, therefore, marrying on Wednesday would have been a capital crime. (The Babli explains otherwise.)</i> they used to marry on Tuesdays and the Sages did not object; about Monday one does not listen to him, but if it was because of a danger it is permitted. What is “because of a danger”? because of sorcery<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If somebody is afraid that sorceresses will put a spell on him to make him impotent if he marries on a day known to be a day for marrying, one lets him marry on any other day.</i>. What is the difference between Monday and Tuesday? One who waits one day cannot be compared to one who waits two days. Why not let him wait two days? That his acquisition should not be sweet for him. Why should his acquisition not be sweet for him? One cannot tolerate it, since Rebbi Hila said in the name of Rebbi Eleazar, if he found the door open, he is forbidden to keep her because she might have been unfaithful<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here סוֹטָה means “unfaithful, deviant” in a general sense, not in the technical sense discussed in Tractate <i>Soṭah</i>. R. Eleazar holds that the Mishnah does not only give the husband the right to complain about lack of virginity but obligates him to go to court to annul his marriage since nobody can stay married to an adulterous wife (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Sotah 5:1:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sotah.5.1.1\">Mishnah <i>Soṭah</i> 5:1</a>) and he presumes his bride was deflowered after she was preliminarily married to him, up to a year earlier. In the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Ketubot 8b-9a\" href=\"/Ketubot.8b-9a\">Babli, 8b/9a</a>, the same argument is quoted in his name.</i>. Could we not suspect that she was raped<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If a married woman is raped, the husband does not have to divorce her unless he is a Cohen.</i>? A rape is public knowledge. And even if you suspect that she was raped, there is no other doubt<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>editio princeps</i>: לֹא סָפֵק <b>אֶחָד</b> “is there not <i>only one</i> doubt?” It is a generally recognized principle in both Talmudim that a single doubt referring to biblical precepts has to be judged restrictively, a double doubt leniently. Cf <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 7:3:5\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.7.3.5\"><i>Yebamot</i> 7:2, Note 73</a>; <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Beitzah 3a\" href=\"/Beitzah.3a\">Babli <i>Beṣah</i>3a</a>.</i>. There is a doubt whether she was raped or whether she was [willingly] opened<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If she was a willing partner to adultery. This only applies to a girl which has the status of adolescent since “the seduction of a minor is rape” (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Yevamot 33b\" href=\"/Yevamot.33b\">Babli <i>Yebamot</i> 33b</a>).</i>. From the words of the Torah one has to be stringent. Rebbi Yose said, if you suspect that she was raped, there are two doubts. There is a doubt whether she was raped or whether she was [willingly] opened; there is a doubt whether it happened after she was preliminarily married or before. From the words of the Torah, with two doubts one has to be lenient<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The husband who claims that his bride was not a virgin is not obligated to divorce his wife against his will; R. Eleazar’s interpretation of the Mishnah is rejected by R. Yose.</i>.",
                "If he performed the preliminary marriage in the bridal chamber, these strictures do not apply. They said that Rebbi Mattaniah acted thus for his daughter<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If the preliminary marriage (see <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Peah 6:2:6\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.6.2.6\"><i>Peah</i> 6:2, Note 46</a>) precedes the final marriage ceremony only by a few moments, the bride could not possibly have committed adultery and R. Eleazar’s argument becomes pointless.<br>R. Mattaniah’s procedure was adopted by all Jewish groups (except that the bridal chamber was transformed into a canopy, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 1:1:3\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.1.1.3\">Note 15</a>.) To separate the preliminary from the final marriage, one spends some time by publicly reading the marriage contract. However, it seems that the current procedure is not derived from any talmudic statement but is a consequence of the poverty of the remnants of the Jewish communities in Western Europe after the devastation of the First Crusade which did not allow most people to organize two festivities, one for the preliminary and a separate one for the definitive wedding; cf. I. Schepansky, התקנות בישׂראל, vol. 3, Jerusalem-NewYork 1992, pp. שע-שעא.</i>.<br>In the opinion of Rebbi Eleazar, could she be married any day at a place where courts are in session every day<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Ketubot 3a\" href=\"/Ketubot.3a\">Babli, 3a</a>, (and at the end also in the Yerushalmi, cf. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 1:1:10\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.1.1.10\">Note 66</a>) this is accepted as a declarative sentence (subject to the condition that the groom spend three days to prepare the wedding feast.)</i>? And at a place where there are no courts (every day)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">An erroneous corrector’s addition (reproduced in <i>editio princeps</i>).</i> could she never be married? One does not want to abolish the time of Wednesday<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nobody challenges the first statement in the Mishnah, even if they disagree with the meaning of the later part of that Mishnah.</i>. Why does one not want to abolish the time of Wednesday? Because he<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Eleazar accepts that the Wednesday/Thursday combination is preferable over Sunday/Monday, even though local courts always also sit on Monday.</i> also accepts what Bar Qappara stated. Bar Qappara said, because a blessing is written there. Could she not be married on Sunday, that he might quickly go to court on Monday? Some want to say, not to abolish the time of Wednesday; some want to say, because of what Bar Qappara stated, for Bar Qappara said, because a blessing is written there<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Ketubot 3b\" href=\"/Ketubot.3b\">Babli, 3b</a>, the reason of the rejection is that the groom has to spend three days to prepare the wedding feast.</i>.",
                "One agrees that she should not be married either Friday or Saturday night. Not on Friday, for the honor of the Sabbath<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That the wedding feast should not impinge on the observance of the Sabbath and the Sabbath meal. As noted above, the wedding of a widow, which proceeds without great fanfare, may be scheduled for Friday.</i>. Not Saturday night: The colleagues say, because of the exertion; Rebbi Yose says, for the honor of the Sabbath<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That he should not prepare on the Sabbath for the feast scheduled directly after nightfall; <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Ketubot 5a\" href=\"/Ketubot.5a\">Babli 5a</a>.</i>.

That means, to make an engagement feast<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since this would impinge on the Sabbath meal. It is in order to make the preliminary marriage on Friday and arrange the engagement feast as the Sabbath meal.</i>. This implies that the preliminary marriage itself is permitted.

Eleazar's statement to the case of either a Cohen (who has to divorce his wife in case of rape) or a person who preliminarily married a girl aged less than 3 full years (who could not have had premarital sex). Note also the change of language: R. Hila in the name of R. Eleazar states that he <i>is forbidden to keep her</i>; here he <i>is not authorized</i> to keep her. As Rashi explains in the Babli, there one treats the case that the husband comes to court to report the case and is ready to be convinced if the proceedings clear his wife. In the Yerushalmi one treats the case that the husband comes to complain convinced that his bride was unfaithful after preliminary marriage. Then one follows the principle that if somebody is convinced that something is forbidden, one cannot permit it.<br>Since the husband is only subjectively forbidden to keep his wife who objectively may have been a virgin, he has to pay the full amount of her ketubah since obligations based on written contracts can be abolished only by a full proof of the guilt of the beneficiary.</i>.

The <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Yevamot 113a\" href=\"/Yevamot.113a\">Babli, <i>Yebamot</i> 113a</a>, notes that if the husband is healed and becomes able to conduct business, the marriage ceremony has to be repeated.)</i>. If a hearing male married a deaf-mute woman, she has a claim to support and <i>ketubah,</i> but if she died, he does not inherit, for he wanted to connect her with his property, but she could not want to connect him with her property.

In the opinion of the rabbis there it is understandable, there is no difference between death and divorce. In the opinion of the rabbis here, what is the difference between death and divorce? Rebbi Ze‘ira said it without attribution, Rebbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: It is reasonable to decide in the case of witnesses of death that if he returns he contradicts them. Rebbi Ḥizqiah said, the rabbis there stick to their opinion since the rabbis there say, when the [first] testimony was accepted, it was accepted as certain. So the rabbis here say, at the moment of her remarriage, she remarried based on certified testimony. Rebbi Yose said, it is reasonable that the rabbis there did not change their argument. Do the rabbis there not agree if two [witnesses] say, his father died while in possession, [and two say his father died while not in possession,] that the field is in Reuben’s possession? Therefore, if two say, she was divorced and remarried, and two say she was not divorced, rightly she should not leave. A <i>baraita</i> disagrees with Rebbi Joḥanan: “If two are saying, she was preliminarily married, and two are saying, she was not preliminarily married, she should not get married, but if she married she should not leave.” Rebbi Hoshaia said, Rebbi Joḥanan may explain it as follows: “If two are saying, she was divorced, and two are saying, she was not divorced, she should not get married, but if she married she should not leave.” What is the difference between this and the first case? There, she was considered a married woman in everybody’s opinion. Here, she is considered a married woman only for two people. If two others came and identified the man who was betrothed to her. A <i>baraita</i> disagrees with Rebbi Joḥanan: “If two are saying, she was kidnapped but is pure, and two are saying, she was kidnapped and is impure, she should not get married, but if she married she should not leave.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A similar text in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Tosefta Ketubot (Lieberman) 2:2\" href=\"/Tosefta_Ketubot_(Lieberman).2.2\">Tosephta <i>Ketubot</i> 2:2</a>.

If two are saying, she had been betrothed and two are saying she had not been betrothed. Rebbi Jonah compares that to fat. If two said, X ate fat, and two said, X did not eat fat, did he not have to bring a “hung” reparation sacrifice because of the doubt? Here, he should give a bill of divorce because of the doubt. Rebbi Yose said to him, do not compare this to fat, because even if he says my conscience bothers me, he brings a “hung” reparation sacrifice. A <i>baraita</i> disagrees with Rebbi Yose: If two are saying she had been betrothed and two are saying she had not been betrothed, she should not get married. The end disagrees with Rebbi Jonah: If she married she must leave. Rebbi Mana said, Rebbi Yose did not say that she may marry, nor did Rebbi Jonah say if she married she must leave, he said only, do not compare this to fat, because even if he says my conscience bothers me, he brings a “hung” reparation sacrifice."

Rebbi Joḥanan said, the Mishnah is two-sided: If he was cautioned, he is flogged; if he was not cautioned, he pays. Rebbi Joḥanan is of the opinion that in a case where there is flogging or restitution, when he pays he is not flogged. Why should he not be flogged and have to pay? (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Deuteronomy 25:2\" href=\"/Deuteronomy.25.2\"><i>Deut</i>. 25:2</a>) “Corresponding to his guilt.” You sentence him for one offence but you may not sentence him for two offences.

A Mishnah disagrees with Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: “If somebody eats heave in error, he pays principal and fifth<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishnah <i>Terumot</i> 6:1.</i>,” but if he was cautioned, will he not be flogged? He explains it following Rebbi Meïr since Rebbi Meïr said, he is flogged and pays. A Mishnah disagrees with Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish, as we have stated: “The following adolescent girls can claim a fine,” but if he was cautioned, will he not be flogged? He explains it following Rebbi Meïr since Rebbi Meïr said, he is flogged and pays. Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: Rebbi Meïr learned from the calumniator. (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Deuteronomy 22:18\" href=\"/Deuteronomy.22.18\"><i>Deut</i>. 22:18</a>) “They shall punish him,” flogging; (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Deuteronomy 22:19\" href=\"/Deuteronomy.22.19\"><i>Deut</i>. 22:19</a>) “and they shall fine him”, money. But the rabbis say, [the law of] the calumniator is separate because of its novelty; one cannot learn from a novelty! Because nowhere else will a person become guilty by speech, but here he becomes guilty by speech; therefore, nothing can be inferred. Another explanation: one cannot transfer the rules of either payment or flogging. Did not Rebbi Abbahu say in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: If he [eats] fat in error but is intentional about the sacrifice, if he was cautioned he will be flogged and has to bring a sacrifice? So here, he is flogged and he pays. Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac said, (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Deuteronomy 25:2\" href=\"/Deuteronomy.25.2\"><i>Deut</i>. 25:2</a>) “Because of his guilt.” If two possibilities are given to the court, one chooses one of them.

Where do they differ? About money in a flogging case.

But Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish must hold that the fifth is a sacrifice. But even if he holds that the fifth is a sacrifice, can the principal be a sacrifice? Rebbi Yudan bar Shalom said, the Mishnah declares that the principal is a fine, as we have stated: “He does not pay in heave but in totally profane food which is turned into heave.” If he had to pay from what he ate, it would be fine. And it was stated: “If he ate impure heave, he has to pay in pure profane food, but if he paid in impure profane, he discharged his obligation.” Does he not owe him the price of wood? That shows that the principal is a fine and since the principal is a fine, the fifth also is a fine. But Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish follows his own opinion.

Rebbi Ze‘ira objected before Rebbi Mana: He who sets fire to his neighbor’s grain stack on the Sabbath is subject to capital punishment from the first ear but only later for payment! One cannot say that because for every single ear there is cautioning for the death penalty. Here also, for every moment of muzzling there is cautioning for flogging.

The one in question here (Mishnah 11) states that the daughters, who do not inherit in the presence of sons, will have to be fed and lodged from the inheritance until they marry (they have a lien on the inheritance which has to be satisfied before the sons, the heirs, can take any money from the inheritance.) Since R.

The reason given for this stipulation is that fathers should be encouraged to give their daughters ample dowries which become part of the <i>ketubah</i> obligations of their husbands, to make them attractive to prospective suitors. Therefore, the stipulation is necessary to insure that the property remains in the possession of the direct descendants of the givers. But since the rape victim and the seduced girl are married by biblical decree, they cannot expect dowries.</i>.

The <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Bava Kamma 87\" href=\"/Bava_Kamma.87\">Babli, <i>Baba Qama</i> 87a/b</a>, states flatly that the father has no claims to sums due under laws which are independent of the sex of the injured party.</i>.

In <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 8:5:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.8.5.1\">Mishnah 8:5</a>, the anonymous majority states that a person may make a will in which he distributes his property unevenly. The will will be valid if formulated in the language of gifts, invalid in the language of inheritance. In <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 8:6:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.8.6.1\">Mishnah 8:6</a>, R. Joḥanan ben Beroqa states that even the language of gifts is acceptable if and only if the recipient is a legal heir directly in line; e. g., one son among many, but not a daughter in the presence of sons since daughters inherit only if there are no sons. If there are no sons, R. Joḥanan ben Beroqa will accept unequal distribution of the estate among the daughters. The Mishnah here is formulated following Ben Beroqa since it accepts unequal distribution of the estate even without writing (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Bava Batra 131a\" href=\"/Bava_Batra.131a\">Babli <i>Baba Batra</i> 131a</a>).</i>: “Rebbi Joḥanan ben Beroqa says, if he speaks about somebody who is a legal heir, his statements are valid, but about somebody who is not a legal heir, his statements are invalid.” Rebbi Joḥanan said, Ben Beroqa spoke only about a son among sons or a (daughter)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">241</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This was the first (correct) word written by the scribe who then (incorrectly) crossed it out and replaced it by “son” to produce a meaningless sentence.</i> son among daughters, not about a daughter and brother or a brother among daughters.

It changes the language of the Mishnah, that the woman’s sons “shall take her <i>ketubah</i>”, making the transaction one of a gift valid from the time of the marriage. Therefore, the rules of inheritance are irrelevant and there is no relation between the Mishnah here and Ben Beroqa’s statement about wills.

As the reader will easily verify, the Aramaic portions of the text have been adapted to Babylonian spelling. Therefore, the text cannot serve as witness to the details of the text: The following is Rosh’s explanation (Chapter 4, #29): “This is the explanation: What are the rules if there was no house there appropriate as a dwelling for the widow and the orphans together? They said to him, the orphans rent a house for her and if she says, real estate, i. e., ‘I want to dwell in my husband’s house’, but they say money, ‘we rent you an apartment but we want to dwell [in the house]’, the law sides with the heirs since she has no property rights in the real estate, only an easement. Therefore, they can rent an apartment for her and they can dwell in that house. {And what we say that she has the right to continue living in her husband’s dwelling (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 12:3:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.12.3.1\">Mishnah 12:3</a>), that is if the house is large enough for all but they want to move her to a lesser apartment.} In the case of that woman, whose <i>ketubah</i> was 20 denars and the only apartment in the estate was a house worth 10 denars (Note of <i>Qorban Nathanael</i>: insufficient to pay the <i>ketubah</i>), R. Ḥanina ruled that either they give her the house or they pay her 20 denars. On that, R. Mana(I) said that she should not take the real estate but that they could give her 10 denars since she has no property rights in the real estate, only an easement. Therefore also in general, since she has no property rights to the apartment, only a claim to be given one, they can move her out of the apartment and rent a different one for her.</i> Rebbi Ze‘ira asked Rav Naḥman bar Jacob and (Rebbi) Abime bar Pappai: What if there was no house? They said to him, the heirs rent a house for her. One concludes that if she says real estate and they say money, the law sides with the heirs. As the following: A woman’s <i>ketubah</i> was twenty denars, and there was a house worth at most ten denars. The case came before Rebbi Ḥanina who said, either they give her a house or they give her twenty denars.

The practice of the returnees from Babylonia probably should read: “When the time has come and they were not definitively married, they eat from his property and eat heave.

For example, if an intestate person dies without heirs (e. g., a proselyte who failed to start a Jewish family), his property becomes ownerless and is up for grabs. Therefore, if somebody goes to the ownerless real estate and acts as proprietor, fencing in or harvesting a field or painting a house, he has acquired the piece of real estate by his action. Similarly, if somebody takes an ownerless slave from the estate and tells him to work on his orders, the work of the slave makes him the property of the person giving the orders. The work can be quite symbolical, such as carrying a stone for a short stretch, to qualify as חֲזָקָה and if the acquirer is a Cohen, the slave is qualified to eat heave. Therefore, the means of acquisition of slave girls and wives are only partially comparable; the ways of acquisition of a slave are not subordinated to those for a wife.</i> to permit her to eat heave, what can you say about a wife who cannot be acquired by active possession? If an argument <i>de minore ad majus</i> can be reversed, the argument is invalid."

The root שאר II has no connection with the usual שאר “to remain, be a remainder” (Arabic سار.).<br>The problem with עֹנָה is that the verb ענה “to humiliate, inflict pain” in sexual context always means “to rape, to have forced intercourse” but in the verse here it has a positive meaning, the intercourse to which the wife is entitled.

The full text has been recovered by Friedman (<i>loc. cit.,</i> pp. 328–329) from Geniza <i>ketubot</i>: “If X, the groom, hates this Y, does not desire her, and wants to separate from her, he shall pay all that is written and specified in this marriage contract, completely. And if this Y hates this X, her husband, and desires to leave his home, she shall lose her <i>ketubah</i> money, and she shall not take anything but only that which she brought from her father’s house and she shall go out by the mouth of the court (עַל פֻּם בֵּית דִּינָה) and with the consent of our masters, the Sages.”<br>The sentence about the husband hating his wife does not bring anything new. The sentence about the wife hating the husband states first that the husband does not have to pay the promised <i>ketubah</i> sum, then that she takes the rags with her (following R. Ismael ben R. Yose in the preceding paragraph), and, finally, that she is to be divorced “by the mouth of the court,” i. e., that the court will direct the husband to divorce his wife. Even though biblical law, as interpreted by all Jewish sects, does grant the husband the exclusive power to divorce, to the exclusion of any right of the wife to force a divorce, R. Yose (the Amora) holds that if the divorce is forced as consequence of a monetary settlement, the stipulation regards monetary, not religious, obligations and is enforceable in court.<br>The essence of this prenuptial agreement, which allows a woman to buy her freedom from an intolerable marriage, was adopted in Babylonia by the Saboraim Rav Rabba and Mar Rav Huna as a <i>taqqanah,</i> a rabbinic ordinance, which instructed the husband to divorce his rebellious wife while granting him the monetary advantages of the Yerushalmi agreement. This ordinance was in fact disestablished by R. Asher ben Ieḥiel, <i>Rosh,</i> in the 14th Century, when he interpreted the rule as a recommendation, not obligatory on the husband. Cf. I. Szczepansky, The <i>Takkanot</i> of Israel, Jerusalem-New York; Vol. 3, Chapter 13 (1992) (Hebrew).

This is a rabbinic rule. R. Meïr holds that no remarriage is permitted in case of any vow that needs to be annulled by an Elder (cf. <i>Nedarim</i> Chapter 9). The reason is that one has to avoid a situation in which the divorcee marries another man and for him goes to an Elder to have him annul the vow. If the ex-husband says, “if I had known that her vow will be annulled, I would not have divorced her,” he retroactively would annul the bill of divorce, make his ex-wife a bigamist and bastards of her children from the second husband. Therefore, one has to make clear to him that the divorce is final and irreversible, to prevent him from having second thoughts. But if the cause of the divorce is an invalid vow, the divorce is not caused by the vow and the husband may remarry his divorcee (as long as she did not marry another man). R. Eleazar says that remarriage was forbidden in the second case because of the first one since it is obvious that the husband must be an ignoramus if he divorces his wife because of a vow which every competent scholar will immediately declare as invalid if asked about it (“a vow which does not have to be investigated by a Sage” because the Sage will declare it invalid at first sight.)</i>” What is the reason of Rebbi Eleazar?

R. Simeon ben Laqish reads the Mishnah as one statement: If he stipulated for the preliminary marriage that the woman should be without vows or blemishes, if his condition is not met he can walk out of his commitment without further obligation. If he goes ahead with the definitive marriage, the marriage is valid and can be dissolved only by a bill of divorce, but his original condition has not been withdrawn and, therefore, he does not have to pay.</i>.

The <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Tosefta Ketubot (Lieberman) 7:9\" href=\"/Tosefta_Ketubot_(Lieberman).7.9\">Tosephta, 7:9</a>, supports R. Simeon ben Laqish.</i>.

Rebbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: But she needs a bill of divorce from him even if he married her preliminarily conditionally but definitively silently<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">130</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the stipulation was not repeated at the definitive marriage, the fact of the definitive marriage retroactively validates the preliminary marriage that would have been invalid if the condition of the bride had been investigated by the groom.

If the defendant rejects the entire claim, the claimant has to prove his case by witnesses or documents; if the defendant admits part of the claim the claimant can request that he swear not to owe more.

Meïr states that “some things are on the ground but are not real estate”. The example given is that the claim is “I handed over to you (to harvest and make wine from) ten vines full of fruit” but the defendant claims “there were ony five.” In that case, R. Meïr requires the defendant to swear but the Sages hold that anything connected to the ground is like real estate.<br>Since the produce on the field is considered as the wife’s capital, not the husband’s produce, R.

This rule is not mentioned in the Yerushalmi and the latter’s position in this matter is not known. In Rashi’s interpretation, only dedications to the altar break contracts, not dedications which are purely monetary gifts to Temple or charity. Therefore, that principle does not apply here in any case.<br>The text is Mishnah <i>‘Arakhin</i> 6:2. There it is stated that if somebody dedicates his encumbered property, neither can the wife collect her <i>ketubah</i> nor a creditor his claim from Temple property which must first be redeemed. Then it is stated that if the creditor’s claim is at least equal to the appraised value of the property, he may lend another denar to the debtor and force him to redeem it to be able to foreclose the now secular property.</i>” Not necessarily a denar, but anything, that a dedication should not be seen to be profanated without redemption<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">81</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a generally accepted principle; <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Arakhin 32b\" href=\"/Arakhin.32b\">Babli <i>Arakhin</i> 32b</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Pesachim 31a\" href=\"/Pesachim.31a\"><i>Pesaḥim</i>31a</a>.

R. Joḥanan implies that a person using the dedicated property for his personal advantage before it was redeemed is obligated for a sacrifice. On the other hand, it is sinful to offer unnecessary sacrifices which would be ”profane animals in the Temple courtyard.” If the sacrifice is valid then the dedication must be valid and could not be undone by a token amount but would require appraisal by a Cohen (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 27:11-14\" href=\"/Leviticus.27.11-14\"><i>Lev.</i> 27:11–14</a>).</i>. That is difficult. If one would be guilty of complete larceny, should if not be redeemed for its full value?

                "<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There are many different interpretations of this paragraph, detailed by R. Jehudah Rosanes in his Commentary מִשְׁנֶה לַמֶּלֶךְ to Maimonides, <i>Hilkhot Iššut</i> 23:1. The following explanation is simply one which seems reasonable to the author.</i> Rebbi Jeremiah asked before Rebbi Ze‘ira: If he wrote to her: “I shall have nothing to do with your properties,” and she inherited properties afterwards, what is the rule<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This question is very elliptic. It is not obvious whether the document was written before or after the definitive marriage and whether the inheritance was foreseeable or not. If the document was written before the definitive marriage and the wife was in line for the inheritance, there is no reason why the husband’s renunciation of his rights would not be valid since that essentially is the case of the Mishnah. In addition, it is the right of any person not to accept an inheritance. Therefore, in view of the answer given, it seems that one speaks of an inheritance which was unexpected, that at the moment of preliminary marriage the wife was not a probable recipient of the inheritance but that later some prospective heirs died which made the wife the next surviving kin. Since such an occurrence is not foreseeable, no contracts can be concluded about them. If the document was executed after the definitive marriage, it would require an additional statement in which the husband cedes his rights to future yield to his wife.</i>? Can a person put a condition on something not in existence<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For example, in talmudic law a farmer cannot write a futures contract on his grain harvest before his seed has sprouted. Similarly, no contract can be written covering unexpected inheritances.</i>? Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya said before Rebbi Ze‘ira: From his rights you can infer his obligations. If he had not written to her, would it make any difference, would he not receive its yield<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the <i>ketubah</i> contract gives the husband the right to the yield of any future properties coming to his wife during their marriage, whether foreseen or not, it follows that he can deprive himself of his right to yield, whether foreseen or not.</i>? That means, from his rights you can infer his obligations. Rebbi Levi bar Ḥaita asked: If he wrote to her: “I shall have nothing to do with your properties which you shall inherit in the future,” what is the rule? Can a person put a condition on something not in existence<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25,</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If the succinct language proposed by R. Jeremiah is invalid, the more explicit language of R. Levi is also invalid. The objection of R. Abun bar Hiyya is irrelevant as far as a separate contract is concerned. But certainly it would be possible for the husband to renounce his right to yield in the ketubah document itself, since what he acquires by the ketubah he can renounce in the ketubah. In that case, his wife's hand in acquiring estates never was his hand and she does not need his renunciation.</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Nazir 2:5 (52b l. 41), the question is asked about a vow to pay for somebody's nazir sacrifices if a person will make a nazir vow in the future, an act over which the maker of the original vow has no control.

Then the question is raised why does the husband eat the yield of property coming from others but not from his own gift. But in this version, the questions of R. Mattanah and R. Immi duplicate one another. The text of Rosh seems to be a contamination of the current and the following paragraphs.<br>The passive voice, real estate <i>should be bought,</i> is that of our Tosephta text, in contrast to the quotes from both Talmudim in which <i>he</i> buys the real estate.

But since with the document of 200 there is an acknowledment of payment and she says, one mina [is due to her], she cannot be paid without an oath<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">166</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He discusses the first case of the Mishnah, if she had compromised the <i>ketubah</i> by signing a receipt for partial payment without specifying the amount. The basic biblical text is <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 22:8\" href=\"/Exodus.22.8\"><i>Ex.</i>22:8</a>: “About any guilty behavior, about an ox, or a sheep, or a garment, or anything lost, if he agrees that this is it, the case of the two parties shall come before <i>Elohim.</i>” This is explained as follows (<i>Mekhilta dR. Ismael,</i> ed. Horovitz-Rabin p. 301; <i>Mekhilta dR. Simeon bar Ioḥai</i> ed. Epstein-Melamed p. 203; <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Bava Kamma 107a\" href=\"/Bava_Kamma.107a\">Babli <i>Baba Qama</i> 107a</a>, <i>Baba Me</i>ṣ<i>i‘a</i> 5a,<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Ketubot 98a\" href=\"/Ketubot.98a\">98a</a>): The paragraph speaks in vv. 6–7 about a person who holds another’s property without being paid for his services, who will not have to pay if the property is stolen and the holder never used it for his own purposes. Then v. 8 continues about <i>any</i> behavior implying monetary obligation, i. e., any monetary claim of one person against another, and requires first that the object of the claim be well defined (an ox, a sheep, etc.) and that the defendant of the suit agree that “this is it”, i. e., that there is a case, then there shall be a trial before a judge acting as <i>Elohim,</i> as a representative of God as judge. <i>In praxi</i> this means that if the claimant cannot prove his case by witnesses or documents, the defendant can free himself from paying by swearing while holding a copy of the Torah and being subject to all the rules of judicial oaths. But if the claim is for one thing (e. g., an ox) and the defendant agrees only that something else is owed to the claimant (e. g., a sheep), or if the defendant disputes the entire claim, he cannot be forced to swear and the claimant loses his case.<br>R. Ze‘ura notes that the case of the damaged <i>ketubah</i> has most of the features of a case requiring an oath by biblical standards, even though it seems otherwise since the divorced wife claims the remainder of the <i>ketubah</i> but the husband claims that all was paid. For that he argues that everybody knows that a <i>ketubah</i> becomes payable at the moment of divorce. Therefore, the husband is considered to have paid the <i>ketubah</i> sum and now he requests to get his money back, and the ex-wife disputes part of his claim. (In the opinion of the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Shevuot 48b\" href=\"/Shevuot.48b\">Babli, <i>Šebuot</i> 48b</a>, 81a, this is held only by the House of Shammai; cf. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 9:7:5\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.9.7.5\">Note 178</a>.) There are two points why the case does not fit the framework of <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 22:8\" href=\"/Exodus.22.8\"><i>Ex.</i>22:8</a>: The person who swears a biblical oath does not have to pay, but in the case under discussion the wife swears in order to collect money. This is by rabbinic tradition. Second, since the <i>ketubah</i> is a mortgage lien (or: in talmudic times was a mortgage lien), the suit is about real estate and real estate claims cannot be settled by oaths (Mishnah <i>Šebuot</i> 6:5). This argument is explicit in the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Ketubot 87b\" href=\"/Ketubot.87b\">Babli, 87b</a>, where the place of R.

In the opinion of most authorities, biblical law requires only minimal quality for the settlement of financial obligations. The rabbinic upgrading was a necessity to make it easier for people to get a loan. Since this argument is irrelevant for orphans, one does not need the Mishnah to know that mortgage debts paid by an estate are settled by low quality real estate.

First, it deals with a scenario that cannot arise since <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 10:1:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.10.1.1\">Mishnah 1</a> stated that a <i>ketubah</i> which precedes in time has to be satisfied from the estate before the later <i>ketubah</i> can be claimed. Therefore, the case of the Mishnah presupposes that the husband married three woman simultaneously. While this is possible in theory, it is excluded in practice. The problem is a practical one if applied to the case that the amount available in bankruptcy proceedings is not sufficient to cover all claims of equal rank.<br>At first glance, it seems that the Mishnah is inconsistent, applying three different rules to three different cases. Since the Mishnah must guide the judge to correctly apportion payment of claims <i>c</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>c</i><sub>2</sub>,<i>c</i><sub>3</sub> if the available amount <i>a &lt; c</i><sub>1</sub><i>+ c</i><sub>2</sub><i>+ c</i><sub>3</sub>, for all <i>a</i> between 0 and <i>c</i><sub>1</sub><i>+ c</i><sub>2</sub><i>+ c</i><sub>3</sub>, it is obvious that the Mishnah has to be explained by one single consistent formula or algorithm. In addition, the algorithm must be applicable to any number <i>n</i> of claims.<br>In the tenth Century, Saadya Gaon suceeded in reducing the number of different rules employed in the Mishnah to two (<i>Oṣar Hageonim Ketubot</i> p. 310). A complete discussion of the Geonic treatment of the Mishnah was given by I. Francus, שיטת הגאונים בפירוש משנה וברייתא, סיני פכו-פכז (תשס-תשסא) קצה-ריב (M. H. Katzenellenbogen Memorial Volume).<br>The first complete solution of the problem of finding a uniform rule for all three cases was given by R. J. Aumann and M. Maschler, Game Theoretic Analysis of a Bankruptcy Problem from the Talmud, <i>J. Econom. Theory</i> <b>36</b>(1985) 195–213. In the framework of the theory of cooperative games, the authors show that the distribution of the Mishnah corresponds to the <i>nucleolus</i> strategy in game theory. Using only elementary mathematics, a single distribution formula covering all cases was given by M. Balinski in: Quelle équité, <i>Pour la science</i> <b>311</b> (September 2003) 82–87; What is Just? <i>Am. Math. MONTHLY</i> <b>112</b>(2005), 502–511. While these authors succeed in explaining the Mishnah in itself, they do not explain the interpretation given to the Mishnah by the Talmudim. Nor do they explain why in both Talmudim the Mishnah is rejected out of hand. The explanation of the Babli is in language close to the Yerushalmi but translated into mathematical formulas the results are quite different; in both Talmudim the proposed explanation results in a procedure which is not monotone; i. e., it is possible that if the available amount <i>a</i> is increased, the payouts for some claimants are decreased. The solutions both of Aumann/Maschler and Balinski are monotone, increasing with <i>a.</i><br>Balinski shows that the Mishnah can be understood in terms of a different distribution problem in Mishnah <i>Baba meṣiʻa</i> 1:1, as indicated by Alfasi (<i>Ketubot</i> 10, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Ketubot 51b\" href=\"/Ketubot.51b\">51b</a> in the Wilna ed.). Since this problem is also the basis of the arguments in both Talmudim, Balinski’s method is explained first. In <i>Baba meṣiʻa</i> there are two claimants for an amount of 1. The first claims it all, the second claims ½. Both claims are of the same status. Then the first is awarded <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>, the second <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>. While the claims are in ratio 2:1, the awards are in ratio 3:1. The reason given is the rule ascribed to Symmachos, a student of R. Meïr, that “money in doubt is split evenly” [Babli <i>Baba meṣiʻa</i> 2b, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Bava Kamma 35b\" href=\"/Bava_Kamma.35b\"><i>Baba qama</i> 35b</a>; Yerushalmi <i>Baba meṣiʻa</i> 8:5 (11d 1. 18); cf. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 2:1:3\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.2.1.3\">Chapter 2, Notes 9</a> ff.]. Since the second claimant asks only for ½, the other half is awarded to the first claimant. The first half is in doubt; therefore it is split evenly between the two parties, resulting in the awards mentioned.<br>In order to arrive at a mathematical formulation, assume that <i>n</i> claims <i>c</i><sub>i</sub> are advanced,<br><i>c</i><sub>1</sub><i>&lt; c</i><sub>2</sub> <i>&lt; … &lt; c</i><sub>n</sub><i>.</i><br>If several claims were identical they would be consolidated into a single claim and the award split evenly between the participants. For any amount <i>a</i> available for distribution, the payout for claimant <i>i</i> is p<sub>i</sub>(<i>a</i>)<i>,</i><br><i>p</i><sub>1</sub>(<i>a</i>)<i>+ p</i><sub>2</sub>(<i>a</i>)<i>+ …</i> <i>+ p</i><sub>n</sub>(<i>a</i>)<i>= a.</i><br>We also introduce the sum of the claims, S =<i>c</i><sub>1</sub> <i>+ c</i><sub>2</sub><i>+ … + c</i><sub>n</sub> and M= S/2. For <i>n</i> = 2, Symmachos’s argument determines the payouts uniquely:<br>If <i>a ≤ c</i><sub>1</sub><i>,</i> the entire sum is in dispute,<br><i>p</i><sub>1</sub>(<i>a</i>)<i>= p</i><sub>2</sub>(<i>a</i>)<i>= a</i>/2<i>.</i><br>Therefore, <i>p</i><sub>1</sub>(<i>c</i><sub>1</sub>)<i>= p</i><sub>2</sub>(<i>c</i><sub>1</sub>)<i>= c</i><sub>1</sub>/2<i>.</i><br>If c<sub>1</sub> &lt; <i>a ≤ c</i><sub>2</sub>, the amount <i>a - c</i><sub>1</sub> belongs to claimant 2 and<br><i>p</i><sub>1</sub>(<i>a</i>)<i>= c</i><sub>1</sub>/2,<br><i>p</i><sub>2</sub>(<i>a</i>)<i>= a-c</i><sub>1</sub><i>+c</i><sub>1</sub>/2<i>= a-c</i><sub>1</sub>/2,<br>and p<sub>1</sub>(c<sub>2</sub>) = <i>c</i><sub>1</sub>/2,<i>p</i><sub>2</sub>(<i>c</i><sub>2</sub>)<i>= c</i><sub>2</sub><i>-c</i><sub>1</sub>/2<i>.</i><br>If <i>c</i><sub>2</sub><i>&lt; a</i>, both claimants have equal rights to the excess over <i>c</i><sub>2</sub>,<br><i>p</i><sub>1</sub>(<i>a</i>)<i>= c</i><sub>1</sub>/2<i>+</i>(<i>a - c</i><sub>2</sub>)/2<br><i>p</i><sub>2</sub>(<i>a</i>) <i>= c</i><sub>2</sub><i>-c</i><sub>1</sub>/2<i>+</i>(<i>a-c</i><sub>2</sub>)/2<i>=</i>(<i>a+c</i><sub>2</sub><i>-c</i><sub>1</sub>)/2<i>.</i><br>If <i>a = c</i><sub>2</sub><i>+c</i><sub>1</sub> = S, all claims are satisfied in full. Using the function min(<i>x,y</i>) = smaller of <i>x</i> or y<i>,</i> Balinski did express the formulas given above by<br>(1) <i>p</i><sub>i</sub>(<i>a</i>) = min(<i>c</i><sub>i</sub>/2, λ) where λ is chosen so that <i>p</i><sub>1</sub>(<i>a</i>)<i>+ p</i><sub>2</sub>(<i>a</i>)<i>= a</i>;<i>i =</i> 1,2.<br>An inspection of the formulas shows that the distribution is symmetric about the middle value of the claims:<br>(2) <i>p</i><sub>i</sub>(<i>M-x</i>)<i>+ p</i><sub>i</sub>(<i>M+x</i>)<i>= c</i><sub>i</sub>.<br>This means that the distribution for <i>M ≤ a ≤ S</i> is determined if it is determined for 0 ≤ <i>a</i>≤<i>M.</i> In the Mishnah here, it should be sufficient to indicate the distribution up to an estate of 300 if the sum of claims is 600. But the generalization of the procedure for <i>n</i> = 2 to <i>n</i> &gt; 2 is not trivial. As Balinski points out, an arbitrary distribution function which yields the given values for <i>a = c</i><sub>i</sub> and satisfies (2) is compatible with the Mishnah. His own solution is to postulate (1) for <i>i</i> = 1, … <i>n.</i> Then (2) is satisfied and the distribution is monotone. For example,<br>{<i>p</i><sub>1</sub>(400),<i>p</i><sub>2</sub>(400),<i>p</i><sub>3</sub>(400)} = {100-<i>p</i><sub>1</sub>(200),200-<i>p</i><sub>2</sub>(200),300-<i>p</i><sub>3</sub>(200)} = {50,125,225}.<br>The problem with this solution, as with most other solutions proposed in the last 1000 years, is that the Talmudim take another view. The solution of the Babli is easily described as a recursive computational procedure. We assume that <i>p</i><sub>1</sub>(<i>a</i>),…,<i>p</i><sub>i-</sub><sub>1</sub>(<i>a</i>) have been determined; leaving an amount <i>a</i><sub>i</sub> to be distributed. We determine <i>p</i><sub>i</sub>(<i>a</i><sub>i</sub>). If <i>c</i><sub>i</sub> ≥ <i>a</i><sub>i</sub>, <i>p</i><sub>j</sub>(<i>a</i><sub>i</sub>) = <i>a</i><sub>i</sub>/(<i>n-i</i>) for <i>j</i> = <i>i</i>, … <i>n</i>. Otherwise, all claims larger than <i>c</i><sub>i</sub> are consolidated into one claim <i>C</i><sub>i</sub> = <i>c</i><sub>i</sub><sub>+1</sub> + … + <i>c</i><sub>n</sub> and <i>p</i><sub>i</sub>(<i>a</i><sub>i</sub>) is the payout assigned to claimant #<i>i</i> in the two-person distribution problem for claims <i>c</i><sub>i</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>i</sub> and amount <i>a</i><sub>i</sub>. The fictitious second claimant then receives <i>P</i><sub>i</sub>(<i>a</i><sub>i</sub>) = <i>a</i><sub>i</sub><sub>+1</sub> and the process continues.<br>In the example of the Mishnah, <i>c</i><sub>1</sub> = 100, <i>c</i><sub>2</sub> = 200, <i>c</i><sub>3</sub> = 300. For <i>a</i> = 100, by the first alternative <i>p</i><sub>j</sub>(100) = 100/3 for all <i>j</i>. For <i>a</i> = 200, <i>c</i><sub>1</sub> = 100, <i>C</i><sub>1</sub> = 400. Therefore, 100 is assigned to the second party and 100 is split evenly. This yields <i>p</i><sub>1</sub>(200) = 50, <i>P</i><sub>1</sub>(200) = 150. Since 200 &gt; 150, the latter amount is split evenly, resulting in <i>p</i><sub>2</sub>(200) = <i>p</i><sub>3</sub>(200) = 75. For <i>a</i> = 300, one sees that <i>p</i><sub>1</sub>(300) = 50, <i>P</i><sub>1</sub>(300) = 250; <i>p</i><sub>2</sub>(300) = 100 = 200/2, <i>p</i><sub>3</sub>(300) = 50 + 200/2 = 150. This explains the numbers stated in the Mishnah, but what about <i>a</i> = 101? In that case, <i>p</i><sub>1</sub>(101) = 50, <i>P</i><sub>1</sub>(101) = 51; <i>p</i><sub>2</sub>(101) = <i>p</i><sub>3</sub>(101) = 51/2 = 25.5. This clearly is unacceptable; the procedure of the Mishnah has to be rejected.<br>The explanation of the Yerushalmi (cf. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 10:4:3\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.10.4.3\">Note 69</a>) is not so clearly stated but it seems to be the following: The procedure also is recursive. If <i>c</i><sub>i</sub> ≥ <i>a</i><sub>i</sub><sub>,</sub><i>p</i><sub>j</sub>(<i>a</i><sub>i</sub>) = <i>a</i><sub>i</sub>/(<i>n-i</i>) for <i>j</i> = <i>i</i>, … <i>n</i>. Otherwise, one considers all two-person problems between claimants <i>i</i> and <i>i</i>+1,…, <i>n</i>. <i>In praxi</i>, this means that one has only to split between <i>c</i><sub>i</sub> and <i>c</i><sub>n</sub>. If <i>c</i><sub>i</sub> &lt; <i>a</i><sub>i</sub> &lt; <i>c</i><sub>n</sub> then <i>p</i><sub>i</sub>(a<sub>i</sub>) = <i>c</i><sub>i</sub>/2. If <i>c</i><sub>n</sub> &lt; <i>a</i><sub>i</sub> then write <i>a</i><sub>i</sub> = <i>c</i><sub>n</sub> + δ. Claims <i>n</i> and <i>i</i> overlap to the amount <i>c</i><sub>i</sub> - δ. This means that<br><i>p</i><sub>i</sub>(<i>a</i><sub>i</sub>) = δ + (<i>c</i><sub>i</sub> - δ)/2 = (<i>c</i><sub>i</sub> + δ)/2.<br>For <i>a</i> ≤ <i>M</i>, the numbers obtained for Babli and Yerushalmi coincide; the Yerushalmi’s method also is not monotone. The results for <i>a</i> &gt; <i>M</i> disagree. For example, for the data of <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 10:4:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.10.4.1\">Mishnah 4</a>, the Yerushalmi gives<br><i>p</i><sub>1</sub>(400)=100, <i>p</i><sub>2</sub>(400)=100, <i>p</i><sub>3</sub>(400)=200 while the Babli gives<br><i>p</i><sub>1</sub>(400)=50, <i>P</i><sub>1</sub>(400)=350; <i>p</i><sub>2</sub>(400)=100, <i>p</i><sub>3</sub>(400)=250.</i>",

If the redemption of the donkey was valid, no sacrifice is due for using the donkey even if there remains the additional obligation to make up the difference in price between toga and donkey. If the redemption is invalid because the difference in price between the dedicated and the substitute values is too large, a sacrifice is due. The Babli, <i>Baba meṣi‘a</i>57a/b, is not quite sure to whom to attribute which opinion in this dispute.</i>.

The Mishnah states that if one suit contains claims that have to be adjudicated following different rules of procedure, they cannot be consolidated and have to be treated separately. Since claims for real estate cannot be resolved by taking oaths (Mishnah <i>Šebuot</i> 6:5), if the claim was for movables and real estate, an admission by the defendant either of the claim for movables in full or for the claim for real estate either partially or in full cannot trigger an obligation to swear.</i> “if he sued him for vessels and real estate; if he admitted the vessels and denied the real estate, the real estate and denied the vessels”?

What does he do with it? He explains it, to transfer an oath to him. But did we not state: If somebody sues another for amphoras of oil, and the defendant admits [that he owes him] vessels”? How do we hold? If he sued him for vessels and oil, and he admitted one of them, everybody agrees that this refers to the claim. But if he sued him for oil and he admitted vessels, everybody agrees that what he admitted does not refer to the claim, for Rebbi Ze‘ira, Rebbi Abuna said in the name of Rav: The Mishnah deals with the case that he sued for vessels full of oil; the ones are full, the others empty<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">84</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the <i>Šebuot</i> text for an intelligible version of this statement.</i>.

Since the problem is one of semantics, does a claim for amphoras of oil imply separate claims for amphoras and the oil that fills them or is “amphora of oil” simply a technical term denoting a standard volume for which contracts of delivery are made? Any judge asked in such a matter will ask the parties to clarify the meaning of their statements and then it will be obvious whether the defendant accepted part of the claim or not. The difference in the interpretation could only arise if one of the parties cannot be asked, either if a party dies or if he loses his speech.</i>? If he lost his speech."

Everybody moves to Jerusalem but not everybody leaves. How is this<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">145</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This word is not in the Babli; it is found in all Yerushalmi Mishnah mss. and Maimonides’s autograph Mishnah. It implies that the preference given to the coin of the Land of Israel is a consequence of the first part of the Mishnah..</i>? If he married a woman in the Land of Israel and divorced her in the Land of Israel, he pays her in coin of the Land of Israel<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">146</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is unproblematic; since <i>ketubah</i> and bill of divorce were executed in the same country, it is clear that the sum stipulated in the <i>ketubah</i>, whose payment was triggered by the bill of divorce, has to be settled in the coin of the country.</i>. If he married a woman in the Land of Israel and divorced her in Kappadokia, he pays her in coin of the Land of Israel. If he married a woman in Kappadokia and divorced her in the Land of Israel, he pays her in coin of the Land of Israel<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">147</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is pointed out in the Babli that in terms of contract law, the two statements contradict one another. If he married in Israel and had to pay in coins of Israel, it implies that the <i>ketubah</i> determines the currency. But if he married in Kappadokia and had to pay in coins of Israel, it implies that the bill of divorce, the trigger of the payment, determines the currency. (In the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Ketubot 101b\" href=\"/Ketubot.101b\">Babli, 101b</a>, and the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Tosefta Ketubot (Lieberman) 12:6\" href=\"/Tosefta_Ketubot_(Lieberman).12.6\">Tosephta, 12:6</a>, Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel states that the place of executing the <i>ketubah</i> determines its currency.) The <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Ketubot 110b\" href=\"/Ketubot.110b\">Babli, 110b</a>, concludes that, since the Persian coins current in Kappadokia are better than the debased Roman coins in Israel, the obligation of the <i>ketubah</i> is a rabbinic institution and the possibility of paying with debased coin was part of the institution. The Yerushalmi (also <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Tosefta Ketubot (Lieberman) 12:6\" href=\"/Tosefta_Ketubot_(Lieberman).12.6\">Tosephta, 12:6</a>) will argue that the Jewish coins of Israel, not the Roman coins, are meant and, therefore, the Mishnah proclaims a stringency which can only be explained by giving the <i>ketubah</i> biblical status.</i>; Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel says, in coin of Kappadokia. If he married a woman in Kappadokia and divorced her in Kappadokia, he pays her in coin of Kappadokia<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">146</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is unproblematic; since <i>ketubah</i> and bill of divorce were executed in the same country, it is clear that the sum stipulated in the <i>ketubah</i>, whose payment was triggered by the bill of divorce, has to be settled in the coin of the country.</i>",
                "<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “Everybody moves,” etc. If he wants to move to the Land of Israel but she does not, one forces her to move<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">148</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the Babylonian texts, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Ketubot 110b\" href=\"/Ketubot.110b\">Babli 110b</a> and Tosephta 10:5, it is explained that “forcing” means that the refusing party is the guilty party in the ensuing divorce.</i>. If she wants but he does not, one does not force him to move<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">149</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Babli and Tosephta: “One forces him”.</i>. If he wants to move to Jerusalem but she does not, one forces her to move. If she wants but he does not, one does not force him to move<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">150</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The sentences about Jerusalem are missing in Babli and Tosephta.</i>. If he wants to leave the Land of Israel but she does not, one does not force her to leave. If she wants to leave but he does not, one forces her not to leave.",
                "“He pays her in coin of the Land of Israel.” This implies that the coins of the land of Israel are the best of all countries<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">151</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since Palestine had no imperial mint in Talmudic times, this cannot refer to Roman coins in circulation, which were coins <i>in</i> the Land but not <i>of</i> the Land. It must refer to the minting standards of the two revolts whose Jewish coins were intended to be used for the Temple tax and as such were of full weight, i. e. the “holy sheqel”. This also must be the meaning of the statement in the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Tosefta Ketubot (Lieberman) 12:6\" href=\"/Tosefta_Ketubot_(Lieberman).12.6\">Tosephta 12:6</a>, cf. S. Lieberman, תוספתא כפשוטה כתובות p. 389.</i>. This supports him who says that a woman’s <i>ketubah</i> is from the words of the Torah<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">152</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Because it has to be paid in terms of biblical coin standards.</i>, against Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel, as it was stated<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">153</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Ketubot 10a\" href=\"/Ketubot.10a\">Babli 10a</a>, in a first version. In the second version and in 110b, he is reported to consider <i>ketubah</i> a biblical obligation. In <i>Mekhilta dR. Simeon bar Ioḥai</i> p. 209, a Babylonian compilation in the opinion of J. N. Epstein, Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel is quoted as saying that <i>ketubah</i> has no fixed sum from the Torah; i. e., the institution is biblical, “the <i>mohar</i> of virgins”, but the amount and all details are rabbinical.<br>The Babli follows the saboraic rule that practice always follows Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel in the Mishnah; a principle not known to the Yerushalmi and certainly rejected here. Cf. also <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 1:2:2\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.1.2.2\">1:2, Notes 112–120</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 4:8:2-15\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.4.8.2-15\">4:8</a> (29a 1. 30), <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 4:11:3\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.4.11.3\">4:12 Note 248</a>; <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 7:3:3\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.7.3.3\"><i>Yebamot</i> 7:2 Note 63, 15:3 Note 63</a>.
