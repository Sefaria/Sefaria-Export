The obligation of Torah study can be fulfilled by the recitation of <i>Shema‘</i>, but that recitation is also an independent obligation. Hence, Torah study <i>per se</i> has no lower limit.</i>.

There are two kinds of <i>terumah</i>. The first one, <i>terumah gedolah</i> “the great <i>terumah</i>” must be given to the Cohen as absolutely first gift after the completion of the harvest. Then a tithe of ten percent, <i>maäser</i>, must be given to the Levite who in turn has to give ten percent, one percent of the original, to the Cohen. The two <i>terumot</i> must be eaten in ritual purity by the priestly families; in contrast the tithe is a civil obligation and is profane food in the hands of the Levite. An infraction of the rules of purity for <i>terumah</i> is a deadly sin. One speaks here about <i>terumah gedolah</i> for the quantity of which the Torah does not give any rules; hence, one grain may be given for an entire silo full of grain. Today, this grain, being ritually impure, has to be burned.</i> with these? Rebbi Immi said, because of the disagreement<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Mishnah <i>Terumot</i> 3:5 we find a disagreement between Tannaïm. Rebbi Eliezer is of the opinion that one may not give more than 10% of the crop as <i>terumah gedolah</i>. Rebbi Ismael gives 50% as upper limit, and Rebbis Aqiba and Tarphon permit one to give as much as one likes on condition that some profane food be left over. Hence, one cannot say that <i>terumah gedolah</i> has no upper limit from the Torah, at least not according to Rebbis Eliezer and Ismael.</i>. Rebbi Yose said<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rebbi Yose (the fourth generation Amora) explains that even according to Rebbis Aqiba and Tarphon, who are followed in practice, <i>terumah</i> has no place in the Mishnah.</i>, one may declare one’s entire field first fruits but one may not declare one’s entire field <i>terumah</i>. They objected: Look, it mentions <i>peah</i>, but nobody may make his entire field <i>peah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Tosefta Peah (Lieberman) 1:1\" href=\"/Tosefta_Peah_(Lieberman).1.1\">Tosephta 1:1</a>.</i>, but it was stated! Rebbi Yose said: The cutting of the first ear is compared to smoothing<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In harvesting grain, the last operation is smoothing the heap of grain (so that theft could be easily detected. In modern terms, the equivalent would be storing the grain in a silo.) <i>Terumah</i> is not due before the end of the harvesting process since it is an obligation only for food. The implication is that workers may eat from the kernels before the end of the harvesting process (cutting, threshing, winnowing, and storing); after that one may not eat from it before <i>terumot</i> are separated.</i>. Before he cut the first ear, the field was not obligated for <i>peah</i>. After he cut the first ear, the entire field became obligated for <i>peah</i> and if he then wants to declare his entire field as <i>peah</i> he may do so<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is not “the entire field,” only “the entire field that is obligated for <i>peah</i>;” hence, the Tosephta that forbids the entire field will permit the field minus one stalk.</i>. But here, before he smoothed his grain heap, the heap was not obligated for <i>terumah</i>. When he wants to declare his entire heap as <i>terumah</i>, he may not do so since we have stated there (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Challah 1:5:5-8\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Challah.1.5.5-8\"><i>Ḥallah</i> 1:9</a>): “He who says: My whole threshing floor shall be <i>terumah</i> or my entire dough shall be <i>ḥallah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ḥallah</i> is the obligatory gift to the Cohen from a (large enough) batch of bread dough, discussed in tractate <i>Ḥallah</i>.

                "Is the first ear obligated for <i>peah</i>? It is impossible to say that it obligated the entire field for <i>peah</i> and itself should be obligated for <i>peah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As explained in the preceding paragraph.</i>. If he cut the first ear and it was burned, does he have to cut another one a second time<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If he wants to give his entire field to the poor as <i>peah</i>, must the ear he cut first be in existence at the moment of dedication?</i>? Let us hear it from the following<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A statement similar to this <i>baraita</i> is in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Tosefta Peah (Lieberman) 1:9\" href=\"/Tosefta_Peah_(Lieberman).1.9\">Tosephta 1:9</a>; the reference is to Mishnah 2:7: “If he cut half the field and sold the other half, the buyer gives <i>peah</i> for everything. If he cut half the field and dedicated the other half, the one who redeems it gives <i>peah</i> for everything.” In both cases, the field is given or dedicated as is, with all obligations on the harvest, since <i>peah</i> must be given at the last corner to be harvested.</i>: “If he cut half the field and sold the other half, or he sold what he had cut, if he cut half the field and dedicated<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To the Temple, the proceeds to be used for the upkeep of the Temple.

This says that if he cut the first ear and it was burned, he does not have to cut a second time<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Because if he dedicated the first half and cut the second half for himself, he must give <i>peah</i> for the entire field from his part. If we replace the dedicated half by the burned ear, we have exactly the case that we are dealing with.</i>.",
                "If he finished the field<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He harvested the entire field without leaving <i>peah</i> for the poor.

If he did not give from sheaves, he must give from stacks. If he did not give from stacks, he must give from the grain heap. If he did not give from the grain heap before it was smoothed, he must first give <i>terumah</i> and tithes and only then <i>peah</i>.” See also Mishnah 1:6, Halakha 7:2, 4:1; an extended version is in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Bava Kamma 94a\" href=\"/Bava_Kamma.94a\">Babli <i>Baba qama</i>94a</a>.</i>, you say that <i>peah</i> devolves on the sheaves. Would <i>peah</i> turn back to the first ear<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That the first cut also may be <i>peah</i> from its sheaf if the entire field was cut.</i>? Rebbi Yose said, let us learn <i>peah</i> of sheaves from <i>peah</i> of standing grain. Since <i>peah</i> from standing grain does not return to the first ear<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As explained in the preceding paragraph, the first cut is not subject to the laws of <i>peah</i> at all since it enables the laws to be applied.</i>, <i>peah</i> of sheaves likewise should not return to the first ear.",
                "<i>Peah</i> has a minimum measure but no maximum measure. First fruits and appearance have neither minimum nor maximum measures. There are those who state: <i>Peah</i>, first fruits and appearance have no measure, neither minimum nor maximum. What is the difference between them, is it not one in sixty<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishnah 2 states that the rabbinic minimum for <i>peah</i> is one sixtieth of the field, 1 2/3 percent. In both formulations it is agreed that <i>peah</i> has no minimum from the Torah but it has a minimum by rabbinic usage.</i>? According to him who says that <i>peah</i> has a minimum measure but no maximum measure: What he gave<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When he harvested but left less than 1 2/3% of the harvest standing on the field. The standing grain certainly has the status of <i>peah</i> and, no longer being the property of the farmer, is not subject to the requirement of <i>terumah</i> and tithes. [The interpretation of R. Simson of Sens is that, while as Biblical commandment there is no lower limit to what he must give, by rabbinic decree any gift of less than 1⅔% is not considered <i>peah</i> and is subject to the laws of tithes even though it is the property of the poor and not of the farmer.]</i>, he gave; if he had second thoughts and added to it, it is subject to tithes until he makes up for it<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Any amount he adds which together with the standing <i>peah</i> does not add up to 1 2/3% of the yield of the entire field, is a voluntary gift, rather than <i>peah</i>, and has the status of grain given after threshing and smoothing the heap.

Simson of Sens, only if he gives all of 1 2/3% at one time] does the rule of <i>peah</i> apply again and the produce may be taken by the poor without further obligation.</i>. According to him who says <i>peah</i>, first fruits and appearance sacrifices have no measure, neither minimum nor maximum: What he gave already freed from the obligation; if he has second thoughts and adds, that is subject to tithes<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To the Temple, the proceeds to be used for the upkeep of the Temple.

Hence, one should read: “Our Mishnah is about appearance with a sacrifice but appearance in person has no measure.”</i> is about appearance with a sacrifice, but appearance in person has a measure.

[The two sacrifices are the holocaust for the altar and a family sacrifice of which only a small part was burned on the altar. The houses of Shammai and Hillel disagree on the distribution of these sums but not on the principle that the first has to be a silver obolus and the second two silver coins.] According to most commentators, the “silver coins” mentioned also are oboli [6 oboli equal one drachma (denar) and four drachmas equal one tetradrachma (סלע)]. In the Roman empire only the emperor could mint silver coins. The Eastern mint was at Tyre; hence, silver coins are also called Tyrian money. Before the inflation of the military anarchy, local coinage was of copper and worth one eighth of the corresponding silver coinage.<br>The following discussion will determine whether these minimal amounts have rabbinic or biblical status.</i>.",

In the Babli, it is explained that the obligation to spend an obolus and two silver coins must be satisfied by unencumbered money. Now four years out of seven there is a second tithe on agricultural produce of the Land of Israel. That second tithe is the property of the farmer but it must be consumed in Jerusalem; it also may be redeemed by money and the money taken to Jerusalem and there spent on food to be consumed in Jerusalem. In addition, the tenth newborn calf or lamb in a herd must be taken to Jerusalem and offered as a sacrifice (only some blood is sprinkled on the altar, the rest is to be eaten by the family of the rancher.) So one may assume that many people on their pilgrimage for the holiday have money and animals of the tithe that they want to eat in Jerusalem to absolve themselves at the same time of the obligations of pilgrimage and (second) tithe. According to Ḥizqiah, on the first day of the holiday one may bring small and cheap animals as obligatory sacrifices and then use the money or the animal of tithes for additional <i>ḥagigah</i> offerings but one may not add the money of second tithes to profane money to buy one large animal for any of the two obligations.<br>In the text, the corresponding statement by R. Joḥanan is missing, viz., that one may add money (if only the basic amount is profane) but not animals (since no animal worth less than two pieces of silver is acceptable as <i>ḥagigah</i>). The statement appears in <i>Ḥagigah</i>.</i>. What may be done<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A rhetorical introduction to the main question, corresponding to: “They asked themselves” in the Babli.</i>? There were before him ten animals, he sacrificed five of them on the first holiday.

If, however, they have only the status of sacrifices in fulfillment of a vow (since any dedication as sacrifice is a vow to bring the animal to the Temple), then they may be slaughtered only during the intermediate days of the holiday or after its conclusion, and they do not push aside holiday prohibitions.</i>? Rebbi Crispus said, Rebbi Joḥanan and Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish have differing opinions. One said, they push; the other one said, they do not push. We do not know who said what. Rebbi Zeïra said, we may explain the words of the rabbis through the words of Rebbi Joḥanan, who<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Aramaic דּוּ is a contraction of דְּהוּא.</i> said: A person may adjoin coins to coins but not animals to an animal.

The question is about the meaning of the word עוֹלל “to go over it a second time”. The root עלל means “go over a second time, do anything a second time.” In Arabic, علل means “to harvest fruits a second time”. For example, עלילה means doing something following a well thought-out plan. Rebbi Jonah reads the verse in Lamentations as: “May all their evil come before You and may You <i>repeatedly</i> punish them, just as You <i>repeatedly</i> punished me for all my sins.” One is not allowed to go over the vines a second time after one has harvested the bunched grapes; that is the equivalent of <i>peah</i> for vines, (מתעלל is usually translated “to abuse, to mistreat,” it should be taken to mean “to mistreat repeatedly” with emphasis on the repetition of abuse.)</i>?

Saadiah Gaon]. The root פאר appears only here in the meaning “to glean”; usually it means “to appear in splendor”. The first meaning reappears in the nouns פֻּארָה “crown of the tree”, פֹֹּארוֹת “tree branch”. Rebbi Jonah identifies first and second meanings, and reads: “Do not remove its splendor.” Then he compares the splendor of the tree, פֻּארָה, to the splendor of one’s head, the hair, that in the second verse also is called <i>peah</i>; hence it follows that the remaining olives on the tree have the status of <i>peah</i> and go under its rules.

Therefore, a special verse is needed for taking the two kinds together to imply that they form one set of sacrifices with common rules.

The Mishnah states that the obligation of giving <i>peah</i> must be fulfilled as long as the relevant produce is in the hand of the farmer, but if it is given before smoothing then it is free from <i>terumah</i> and the two tithes. If <i>peah</i> is given later, the farmer has first to give <i>terumah</i> and tithes before he can discharge his obligation for <i>peah</i>. [In the Mishnah manuscripts there is a second sentence, that he who declares part of his crop as abandoned is freed from the relative <i>terumah</i> and tithes if it is abandoned before smoothing. This sentence is missing in the Yerushalmi and in the Munich manuscript of the Babli.]<br>The Halakhah takes the expression: “Forever he gives,” as meaning that he can give under the rules of <i>peah</i> until he has smoothed the heap, even if he gave <i>peah</i> from grain standing on the field, and avoid the obligation of <i>terumah</i> and tithes for that amount. That seems to contradict our understanding of Mishnah 3.</i> he gives as <i>peah</i> and it is free from tithes until he smoothes.

Aqiba.</i>. If a Cohen or a Levite bought all the grain of a threshing floor, the tithes belong to them until it was smoothed<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">278</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is nothing in the Torah which states that a Cohen could not give his own <i>terumah</i> and tithes to himself. But the rabbis ordained that Cohen and Levite have to give their tithes away in order to create a level playing field, lest Cohen and Levite farmers could drive the others out of business since they have a built-in 10% advantage in costs over the non-Levitic farmer. In the opinion of Maimonides, the rule was established in order to prevent the monopolizing of tithes by a few wealthy priests. However, if a priest bought produce before it was obligated for tithes, he may keep the tithe but not <i>terumah</i>.</i>. He who dedicates<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">279</sup><i class=\"footnote\">His crop or his field.</i> to the Temple and then redeems is obligated for tithes unless it was smoothed by the Temple administrator<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">280</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Temple property is not subject to the laws of tithes.

(While the first tithe is a civil obligation of the farmer towards the Levite, the <i>terumah</i> of the tithe is a religious obligation and it is a deadly sin to eat from the produce as long as that <i>terumah</i> of the tithe is still not separated from the rest of the grain. The first <i>terumah</i> is called the <i>great terumah</i>.) It is now asserted that First Fruits, which are brought to the Temple and will be eaten there by the priests, are not subject to <i>terumah</i> even though <i>peah</i>, which is eaten by the poor, can no longer be separated from the heap before the farmer separates the two <i>terumot</i> from his grain.</i>, it is free from the great <i>terumah</i>. Rebbi Ḥaggai said before Rebbi Yose: Does not the Mishnah say so: “Forever he gives <i>peah</i> and it is free from tithes until he smoothes.” Hence, if he smoothed he is obligated, but this does not apply to <i>terumah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">282</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the Mishnah speaks only of the obligation of tithes, not <i>terumah</i>.</i>? It should say that he also is obligated for first fruits even though he did not smooth yet<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">283</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the answer of R. Yose to R. Haggai, refuting his argument: If the Mishnah is supposed to mention every detail, it certainly should have mentioned First Fruits since they are really supposed to be designated when grain or fruits are still on field or tree. Hence, “tithes” is a catchword for all obligations and the Mishnah does not prove anything for the rule under discussion.</i>!

Each of them is called (in the Torah) <i>terumah</i> and <i>beginning</i>’, but First Fruits should precede everything because they are first before everything.”</i> is the one who said this: “Why are they called firstlings? Because they are first before everything else.” And anything which precedes something else, the latter is obligated for it<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">285</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a general principle which will be discussed at length in <i>Demai</i> 5:1. The fixed order of Biblical obligations is First Fruits (where applicable), <i>terumah</i>, First Tithe, Second Tithe. Hence, if somebody gave First Tithe before he gave <i>terumah</i>, he has to separate <i>terumah</i> from this First Tithe and he may not include <i>terumah</i> for the First Tithe in the <i>terumah</i> that he will give from the remaining grain, but <i>terumah</i> carries no obligation of tithe. As a consequence, First Fruits carry no obligation of <i>terumah</i> and even the fact that the heap now is under the obligation of <i>terumah</i> and tithes has no influence.

Hence, when the robbers cut the grain, there is no obligation of <i>peah</i> incurred by the farmer since neither he nor his employees are doing the harvesting.

Prozbol was instituted by Hillel as a way to circumvent the annulment of debts in the Seventh Year in cases when that annulment would only be a rabbinic ordinance. Since only debts due to real persons are annulled by the Seventh Year, the creditor may deliver the debt to the court to be collected.

However, since buying real estate is a stronger form of contract, a contract or understanding to buy real estate can be extended to include movables. In that case, the moment of transfer of property rights to the real estate is determining also for the movables. The ways of acquiring real estate are either a contract witnessed by two witnesses, or payment of cash in front of witnesses, or a court ruling confirming squatters’ rights. The general theory of these matters is discussed in tractate <i>Qiddušin</i>; the exact and restrictive definition of enforceable squatters’ rights is one of the topics of tractate <i>Baba Batra</i>.</i>.<br>If someone signs over his properties<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">148</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In a gift document.</i> when bedridden and reserved for himself any real estate, his gift is permanent<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">149</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since he reserved property, the document is a gift and not a will, on condition that it was executed under all conditions of a valid gift.</i>; if he did not reserve any real estate for himself, his gift is not permanent<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">150</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If he did not reserve anything for himself, it is clear that he did not expect to survive.

The value of the obligation was fixed at 200 <i>zuz</i>(800 silver denars) for a virgin and 100 <i>zuz</i> (400 silver denars) for a previously married woman. A measure of the intended value of these sums is found in Mishnah 8:8,9, viz., that anyone with 200 <i>zuz</i> investment capital or 50 <i>zuz</i> business capital is living above the poverty line and barred from receiving charity.<br>The Halakhah explains the circumstances under which the wife may agree to be co-heir to the sons.

Cf. also <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Demai 5:8:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.5.8.1\"><i>Demay</i>, Chapter 5, Note 102</a>.</i> who says that a Gentile may acquire real estate in the Land of Israel to free it from tithes<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">130</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is explained in <i>Demaï</i>(<i>loc. cit</i>.) and elsewhere that the Biblical duties of heave and tithes ceased with the Babylonian exile. The returnees from Babylonia took these duties upon themselves and future generations in a solemn covenant with God (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Nehemiah 10:1\" href=\"/Nehemiah.10.1\"><i>Neh</i>. 10:1</a>) in those regions (Judea, the Southern Plains, Galilee, and Golan Heights) settled by the returnees; hence the problem is not one of Biblical precepts but of the meaning of this covenant. According to the position taken here, the obligation of <i>peah</i>, gleanings, and forgotten sheaves is a later Rabbinic obligation on the land as far as Jews are concerned (<i>Demaï</i> 3:4, fol. 23d). Since the Gentile has no obligation to give to the poor, he cannot designate anything under these names. But since he is the owner, he may legally abandon the produce just as a Jew might abandon it.</i>. But according to him who says that a Gentile may not acquire real estate in the Land of Israel to free it from tithes, even if he declared it abandoned property it is obligated<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">131</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to R. Meīr, the obligation is on the Land, not on the owner. If the agricultural real estate is owned by a Gentile, the obligation obviously cannot be enforced since the Gentile has no obligation to abide by the covenant. However, if the produce is then bought by a Jew, it will be a deadly sin for him to consume anything from it before he has given the heave and, at least, the priest’s part of the tithe. The only exception is abandoned property (by Mishnah 6:1, this must be abandoned to any taker, not just the poor.) Now, <i>peah</i>, gleanings, and forgotten sheaves also are free of heave and tithes but these can be given only by persons obligated to give. Hence, <i>peah</i>, gleanings, and forgotten sheaves designated by Gentiles do not have the legal status of <i>peah</i>, gleanings, and forgotten sheaves, and are not exempt; neither does abandoning the property help since nothing the Gentile does can possibly influence the duties upon the produce.</i>.

But according to him who says that a Gentile may acquire real estate in the Land of Israel to free it from tithes, the Sages decreed special leniency for gleanings<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">134</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If the Gentile designated some produce as <i>peah</i>, or left gleanings on the field, he clearly abandoned this to the poor. The general rule is that abandoned property must be abandoned to rich and poor alike (Mishnah 6:1), but in the case before us the rabbis made an exception; it is the leniency mentioned here.

If he abandoned in an unspecified way. But if he said: My field shall be abandoned one day, one week, one month, one year, a sabbatical period, as long as nobody took it over, either he or another person, he may cancel. But after somebody acquired it, either he or somebody else, he cannot cancel.” This means that short or long periods are the same.

It is stated in the paragraph after the next that in one interpretation the Mishnah deals only with the case that the sheaf was already taken up to be brought to the threshing floor but then was deposited somewhere and forgotten. It is stated as a general principle of the House of Shammai that the farmer already acquired final possession of the sheaf by taking it up. The House of Hillel is of the opinion that the Biblical ordinance of the forgotten sheaf overrides everything until the grain is removed from the fields. The operating term in this respect is (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Deuteronomy 24:19\" href=\"/Deuteronomy.24.19\"><i>Deut</i>. 24:19</a>) “and <i>you</i> will forget,” i. e., it must be you who forgets. We have to assume that the House of Shammai in principle also will agree to such an interpretation. Then we would say that it is difficult to forget something deposited near a landmark; hence, if it is forgotten, the House of Shammai are not justified not to declare it a forgotten sheaf. On the other hand, if the sheaf was deposited near movable objects and is not easily found again, the House of Hillel should have accepted the action of prior acquisition. (Interpretation of <i>Tosafot Yom Tov</i> on the Mishnah.)<br>But the position of this set of questions before the interpretation of the Mishnah seems to indicate that the question is asked in a general way, rather than about a sheaf which was already taken up. Therefore, most commentators, from R. Simson to R. Z. Frankel, prefer to change the text and switch the names of Hillel and Shammai. There is no textual basis for this. The best interpretation of the text as it stands is the one of R. Moshe Margalit, who explains as follows: “It is difficult about the House of Shammai; (<i>if their reason is that</i>) closure and stack are definite things (<i>location not easily forgotten</i>), and they say (<i>even for cattle and vessels</i>,<i>which are easily moved</i>) it is not a forgotten sheaf!
