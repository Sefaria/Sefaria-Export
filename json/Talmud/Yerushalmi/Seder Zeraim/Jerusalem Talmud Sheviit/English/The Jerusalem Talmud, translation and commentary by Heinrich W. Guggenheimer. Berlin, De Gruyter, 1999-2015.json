In both places, the argument is attributed to the school of R. Aqiba. In <i>Mekhilta deR</i>.<i>Simeon bar Ioḥai</i> to 34:22, it is attributed to R. Jehudah. Practice noted in the next paragraph follows the school of R. Ismael as explained in Mishnah 5.</i> (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 23:12\" href=\"/Exodus.23.12\"><i>Ex</i>. 23:12</a>): “Six days you shall do your work but on the Seventh Day you shall rest.” And it is written (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 34:21\" href=\"/Exodus.34.21\"><i>Ex</i>. 34:21</a>): “You shall rest from ploughing and harvesting.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The argument is somewhat elliptic. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 23:12\" href=\"/Exodus.23.12\"><i>Ex</i>. 23:12</a> reads: “Six days you shall do your work but on the Seventh Day you shall cease, so that your donkey and your ox may rest and the son of your bondsmaid and the stranger may recuperate.” <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 34:21\" href=\"/Exodus.34.21\"><i>Ex</i>. 34:21</a>: “Six days you shall work; on the Seventh day you shall rest, from ploughing and harvesting you shall rest.” It would seem more natural to quote the second verse <i>in toto</i>; this is the approach of the commentaries which emend the first quote away but such an approach is impossible since our text clearly quotes two different verses. The explanation is in the <i>Mekhiltot</i>(<i>deR</i>.<i>Ismael</i>,<i>Massekhta dekhas pa</i>, p. 331; <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 21:1-24:18\" href=\"/Exodus.21.1-24.18\"><i>deR</i>.<i>Simeon bar Ioḥai</i>,<i>Mishpaṭim</i>, p. 217</a>): It says in the Ten Commandments, that “six days you shall labor and do <i>all</i> your work.” Hence, one could think that the Sabbath has to be kept only if <i>all</i> work is permitted on weekdays. This would exclude the Sabbath days of the Sabbatical year since most agricultural work is forbidden in the Sabbatical. Hence, the verse <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 23:12\" href=\"/Exodus.23.12\"><i>Ex</i>. 23:12</a> is necessary to include the Sabbath days of the Sabbatical years; this only makes sure that <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 34:21\" href=\"/Exodus.34.21\"><i>Ex</i>. 34:21</a> is redundant as far as both Sabbath day and Sabbatical year are concerned.</i>” Where do we hold?

A Mishnah disagrees with Rebbi Zeïra as we have stated (<i>Terumot</i> 9:4): “A growth from heave is heave but the growth from its growth is profane. But the growth from <i>ṭevel</i>, First Tithe, aftergrowth of the Sabbatical, heave of the tithe, <i>dema‘</i>, and First Fruits is profane.” We have stated on this: “When is this true?

This excludes <i>olentia</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Berakhot</i>, pp. 87, 501. תפילין is derived from Arabic תַּפִֹל “mal odorous”.</i> which are only for the malodorous.

Hence, seeds harvested in the Sabbatical retain their Sabbatical quality even after the end of the year. {For דן cf. Arabic דאן “to be of inferior quality”, for צד Arabic צדא “rust”.}<br>The argument goes as follows: It is stated in Mishnah 8:1 that animal feed may be used to make wound dressing; only Sabbatical human food may not be used. In itself, animal feed has the sanctity of the Sabbatical and cannot be used for industrial purposes. Then one cannot understand why dyestuff seeds retain their sanctity but wound dressing does not. The answer is that the next argument will show that human needs have precedence over animal needs but once the product is no longer available for all of mankind it cannot have sanctity attached.</i>: “Sanctity of the Sabbatical falls on <i>din</i>, <i>sad</i>, and indigo seed that one sows after the end of the Sabbatical.” What is that? “For you”, for all of you equally.

Also for your (<i>sing</i>.) domestic animals, as well as the wild animals in your land, shall all its yield be food.”</i>. What reason do you have to say that from human food one cannot make a wound dressing but from animal feed one may make a wound dressing? He said to him (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 25:6\" href=\"/Leviticus.25.6\"><i>Lev</i>. 25:6</a>): “The Land’s Sabbath shall be for you as food”, an exclusion.

Bun bar Ḥiyya refutes the arguments of R. Zeïra and R. Yose: Since “for you, your slave, and your handmaid,” is a necessary addition, as explained above, to permit the rich person to eat, it cannot be treated as an exclusion. The explanations are invalid.</i>. Rebbi Yose did not say so, but (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 25:6\" href=\"/Leviticus.25.6\"><i>Lev</i>. 25:6</a>): “The Land’s Sabbath shall be for you as food”, an exclusion, “for you, your slave, and your handmaid”, an exclusion after an exclusion, to add that human food cannot be made into wound dressing<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here we find an essential difference between the exegesis of Babli and Yerushalmi. In the Babli, a double restriction always means an addition, no restriction at all. For the Yerushalmi, any exclusion remains an exclusion; one adds exclusions that otherwise would not be thought of. The verse really contains more exclusions and inclusions: “The Land’s Sabbath shall be for you (<i>pl</i>.)”, not for the Gentile (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Tosefta Sheviit (Lieberman) 5:21\" href=\"/Tosefta_Sheviit_(Lieberman).5.21\">Tosephta 5:21</a>) but for all your needs (Mishnah 8:2), “as food”, not for industrial use and not for sacrifices [<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Sifra, Behar\" href=\"/Sifra,_Behar\"><i>Sifra Behar</i> 1(10</a>)]. “For you (<i>sing</i>.), your slave, and your handmaid,” seems to be an addition since this allows rich people to eat Sabbatical produce [<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Sifra, Behar\" href=\"/Sifra,_Behar\"><i>Sifra Behar</i> 1(10</a>)], even though it is written (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 23:11\" href=\"/Exodus.23.11\">Ex. 23:11</a>): “Abandon the yield of the Sabbatical, so it may be eaten by the destitute of your people …” The verse here permits slaveholders, i. e., people of means, to eat Sabbatical produce. According to <i>Mekhilta Mišpaṭim</i> 20, still only poor people may eat Sabbatical produce under the obligation of removal. It follows that “you, your slave, and your handmaid,” is stated on condition that there be food for the wild animals, and can be considered a restriction. “Your hired hand and your sojourner who are dwelling with you” are Gentile employees hired for a period of time (“dwelling with you”), not hourly workers. They are exempt from the ban to give Sabbatical fruit to Gentiles. “Also for your domestic animals, as well as the wild animals in your land, shall all its yield be food,” domestic animals can be fed stored food in the stable only as long as they could find it in the fields by themselves.<br>The argument in the Halakhah seems to be the following: Since Sabbatical produce is “for you”, one could think that this (1) only excludes the Gentile, but a Jew may use Sabbatical produce for anything he needs. It is specified “for you, your slave, and your handmaid,” which (2) excludes use of Sabbatical produce for any but human use. Wound dressings (as well as emetics) are used for human needs. If there were only one exclusion, I would include medical uses. But since there are two, one has to give an expansive interpretation of the exclusion; the only uses permitted are those needed equally by master and slave, the healthy and the sick. Therefore, medical (non-food) uses are forbidden, washing and heating is permitted. This argument is diametrically opposed to any Babylonian argument which treats two consecutive exclusions as inclusion.</i>. He added animal feed!

Rebbi Mattaniah said, when you did exclude, you excluded from human food; when you included, you included animal feed<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is enough to have one exclusion mentioned for humans; since there is no similar exclusion for animals, which have the right to Sabbatical produce whether owned by a Jew or not, it is reasonable to have a restrictive tradition for human food but not for animal feed.</i>.",

In this case, ownership is vested in the seller until the buyer actually takes possession. The other opinion notes that Abraham bought the field of Makhpela by paying money; it follows that the Torah recognizes payment as effecting transfer of ownership. According to this opinion, rabbinic practice was introduced to cut down on fraudulent transactions, so that the seller could not sell non-existing goods and later claim that they did exist at the time of payment but before delivery were destroyed in a fire.<br>The position ascribed here (and in Yerushalmi <i>Erubin</i> 7:11, fol. 24d) to R.

However, the Talmud of Caesarea (Yerushalmi <i>Baba Meẓia‘</i> 4:2, fol. 9d) states that R. Joḥanan asked (and followed) R. Yannai’s opinion in the matter and the latter stated that payment transfers property rights by Torah law and that rabbinic practice was only instituted to cut down on fraud. Since practice almost always follows R. Joḥanan against R. Simeon ben Laqish, Tiberian practice followed the opinion of R. Joḥanan in the text here, Babylonian and Caesarean that of R. Simeon ben Laqish.</i>. According to Rebbi Joḥanan, who said that [transfer of] money does not mean acquisition by Torah law, he paid for food.

This shows that the original place of this piece is <i>Beẓah</i>. Since the holiday is a new sanctity and one may light fires on the holiday, it is difficult to see how Rav could forbid using the fuel on the second day. The Babli (<i>loc</i>.<i>cit</i>.

Because they disagree: May the remainders of a wick, a fire, or oil that burned out on the Sabbath be lit on the holiday? Rav and Rebbi Ḥanina both say it is forbidden, but Rebbi Joḥanan says it is permitted. Rebbi Mana said before Rebbi Judan, are the rules different for a wick and an egg? He said to him, since the rabbis compare it, it means that the cases are identical<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Babli gives several tentative explanations of Rav’s position. The one consistent with the Yerushalmi is that only weekdays can prepare for holidays (cf. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Sheviit 9:1:8\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit.9.1.8\">Note 24</a>) but the Sabbath cannot prepare for a holiday. Since the reason for Rav’s ruling in the case of fuel is not based on the number of sanctities involved, there is no inconsistency in his decisions. It is difficult to understand why the Yerushalmi has no answer to R. Ḥisda’s question.</i>.",

(Some tannaitic authorities hold that the absence of such a lien from a document is an error of the scribe; the existence of a lien may always be assumed.) Since the lien (known as “alienation of property”) is not specified, the lender can foreclose on such a loan only by lengthy court proceedings. If the loan is documented and given as a mortgage on a specific parcel of real estate, in the theory of the Yerushalmi it is a loan on a pledge and not remitted, as stated in Mishnah 2.</i>.

The meaning of the distinctions made in the Babli is not clear; therefore, Maimonides omits the rule in his Code. The only coherent explanation of the Mishnah is that given by Rabbi Isaac in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Tosafot on Kiddushin 18a:1:1\" href=\"/Tosafot_on_Kiddushin.18a.1.1\">Tosaphot (<i>Qiddušin</i> 18a, s. v. כאן</a>) and R. Nissim Gerondi in his commentary to Alfassi (<i>Qiddušin</i> #596): Since a convert is like a newborn for Jewish law, the children converting with him are not legally his Jewish children and the law will not force the debtor to pay after the lender’s death. However, the children are his own children and not to pay the sons after their father’s death is reprehensible. If the convert has children after his conversion, they are his Jewish children and all laws of inheritance apply. The only problem arises if his pregnant wife converted with him. The Babli notes that in such a case, the Sages are displeased with any repayment to the child born after conversion. The reason given by the commentators is that the child is Jewish by birth; if the laws of inheritance did apply one would conclude that the child is legally a relative of his father and his older siblings. But the fact is that a Gentile father never can have a legal relationship with his child by a Jewish mother. For example, if a Jewish man marries his late father’s other wife, this relationship is incestuous and the marriage is non-existent; the woman can marry another man without a divorce. But if the child conceived as a Gentile would marry one of his late father’s wives other than his mother, while the marriage is not tolerated it is valid and would need a formal divorce. The Yerushalmi does not consider this unlikely case. {The <i>Šulḥan Arukh</i>,<i>Ḥošen Mišpaṭ</i> §127(2) decides otherwise, following what is reported in the name of Rashi.}</i>.

                "Rebbi Jacob bar Zavdi, Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: If somebody wanted to change his mind after he had promised a gift to another person, he may change his mind<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">133</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Also in <i>Ma‘ser Šeni</i> 4:7 (fol. 55b), <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Bava Metzia 4:2:2-7\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Metzia.4.2.2-7\"><i>Baba Meẓi‘a</i> 4:2</a> (fol. 9c-d), <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Bava Metzia 49a\" href=\"/Bava_Metzia.49a\">Babli <i>Baba Meẓi‘a</i> 49a</a>. In the Babli, the statement is restricted to large gifts.</i>. Rebbi Yose was with Rebbi Jacob bar Zavdi; he said to him: Is that just no (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 19:36\" href=\"/Leviticus.19.36\"><i>Lev</i>. 19:36</a>) “and just yes?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">134</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This cryptic statement is explained in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Sifra, Kedoshim, Chapter 8 7\" href=\"/Sifra,_Kedoshim,_Chapter_8.7\"><i>Sifra Qedošim Pereq</i> 8(7</a>), <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Bava Metzia 49a\" href=\"/Bava_Metzia.49a\">Babli <i>Baba Meẓi‘a</i> 49a</a>: “Why does the verse mention ‘a just <i>epha</i> and a just <i>hin</i>’? Is not a <i>hin</i> a part of an <i>epha</i>, how can one have correct measures for one and not the other? One takes biblical <i>hîn</i> as rabbinic <i>hēn</i> ‘yes’. That your yes should be a yes and your no a no, the same in your mind and your mouth.”</i>” He said, when he said it, it was a just yes. Rav disagrees since Rav said, when I tell my family to give a gift to somebody, I never change my mind<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">135</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is taken as a legal statement; at the end it will be accepted as a moral precept only.</i>.

In the domain of the buyer, when the deal was accepted<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">137</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Things deposited on a persons’s real estate are his property as soon as he has the right to them.</i>; in the domain of the seller one never acquires until either he lift it up or he draw and remove everything from the prior owner’s property. In the domain of a depositary he cannot acquire unless he gave permission or rented their place out to him.” What does Rav do with this<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">138</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Why should he not change his mind since there was no acquisition and no money given?</i>?

Rav disagrees since Rav said, when I tell my family to give a gift to somebody, I never change my mind.

Joḥanan holds that a surety establishes a claim for the entire lot in question. The version of the story here implies that Rav was the judge.</i> or he should be given up to “Him who made pay”. The arguments of Rav are contradictory. There he says, when I tell my family to give a gift to somebody, I never change my mind and here he says so<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">142</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For his own gifts he establishes the rule that a gift is unchangeable, for commercial transactions he says that they are reversible, even if that would be morally wrong.</i>? There it is for a legal rule; what Rav did himself was a measure of piety."
