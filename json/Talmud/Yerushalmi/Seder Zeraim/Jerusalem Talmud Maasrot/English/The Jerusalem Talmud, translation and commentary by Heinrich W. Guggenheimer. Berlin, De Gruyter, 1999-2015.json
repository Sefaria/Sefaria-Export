                "<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “They declared a principle for tithes, etc.” It is written (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Deuteronomy 14:22\" href=\"/Deuteronomy.14.22\"><i>Deut</i>. 14:22</a>): “You should certainly tithe all produce of your seed.” I would say, everything is subject to tithes. The verse says, “<i>all</i> produce of your seed,” this includes. Does it include garden seeds that are not eaten? It is written: “produce of your seed,” and it is written: “which your field produces every year.” How is that? Take from among them anything that is food and is guarded<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The argument is rather cryptic since it also involves v. 23 which is not mentioned in the text. The full text of the verses is: “You should certainly tithe all produce of your seed which your field produces every year. Then you should eat before the Eternal, your God, at the place He will choose to let His Name dwell there, the tithe of your grain, your cider, and your oil, as well as the firstborn of your cattle and sheep, so that you shall learn to fear the Eternal, your God, all the days.” While the second verse refers only to Second Tithe, the insistence of the first verse. עשׂר תעשׂר, “you should certainly tithe”, is taken to mean that the rules apply to both tithes equally (<i>Sifry Deut</i>. 105). The Babli frequently (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Berakhot 36b\" href=\"/Berakhot.36b\"><i>Berakhot</i> 36b</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Pesachim 44a\" href=\"/Pesachim.44a\"><i>Pesaḥim</i> 44a</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Beitzah 3b\" href=\"/Beitzah.3b\"><i>Beẓah</i> 3b</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Yevamot 81b\" href=\"/Yevamot.81b\"><i>Yebamot</i> 81b</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Nedarim 51a\" href=\"/Nedarim.51a\"><i>Nedarim</i> 51a</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Bekhorot 54b\" href=\"/Bekhorot.54b\"><i>Bekhorot</i>54b</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Chullin 120b\" href=\"/Chullin.120b\"><i>Ḥulin</i> 120b</a>) insists that the second verse restricts tithes in biblical law to grain, grapes and wine, and olives and olive oil. All other tithes are considered only rabbinic. The Yerushalmi here, by not quoting the second verse explicitly, extends biblical obligations of tithe to all fruits. However, for practical purposes the Yerushalmi declares all tithes, including grain, wine, and oil, as voluntary (rabbinic) obligations in force since the return from Babylonian captivity (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Sheviit 6:1:4-5\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit.6.1.4-5\"><i>Ševi‘it</i> Chapter 6, Notes 11–13</a>). Therefore, the biblical law as explained here is applicable only to the past, from Joshua to the destruction of the first Temple, and the future, the days of the Messiah.<br>The paragraph here is shorthand for the detailed discussion, transmitted, e.g., in <i>Sifry Deut</i>. 105. Since v. 22 speaks of <i>all</i> produce, one could think that all produce is subject to tithes, including industrial crops like indigo and madder. Since v. 23 requires the tithe to be eaten, industrial crops are excluded. Nevertheless, the expression “all” must include produce not otherwise mentioned. Since v. 23 speaks only of grain, wine, and oil, it follows that v. 22 includes all other fruits and seeds. However, v. 23 excludes seeds that are not food. The <i>Sifry</i> goes on to include vegetables that are not seeds from the verse <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 27:30\" href=\"/Leviticus.27.30\"><i>Lev</i>. 27:30</a>: “All tithe from the earth, from seeds of the earth, from fruits of trees, belongs to the Eternal.” Here, “from the earth” is taken to denote vegetable food that is neither seed nor tree fruit. While <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 27:30\" href=\"/Leviticus.27.30\"><i>Lev</i>. 27:30</a> is discussed in the next paragraph in parallel to <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Deuteronomy 14:22-23\" href=\"/Deuteronomy.14.22-23\"><i>Deut</i>. 14:22–23</a>, the argument of the <i>Sifry</i> is not mentioned and in the Yerushalmi it is the generally accepted opinion that tithes of vegetables are purely rabbinical, cf. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Maasrot 1:1:4\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Maasrot.1.1.4\">Note 17</a>.</i>.",

                "Rav Ḥisda said, if somebody declared his standing grain ownerless, came back and retook possession, and illegally gave heave, that is heave<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Produce collected from ownerless property is not subject to heave and tithes, as deduced later in this paragraph from <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Deuteronomy 18:4\" href=\"/Deuteronomy.18.4\"><i>Deut</i>. 18:4</a>. In general, if somebody gives heave and tithes from exempt produce, his action is invalid and no sanctity is attached to the heave given. Standing grain is not under any obligation of heave. The obligation of heave and tithes falls on the grain when it is stored after threshing but there is a latent obligation from the time it is cut since then it is potential commercial produce. Therefore, if heave was given from standing grain, that is an invalid act; if heave was given from cut ears of grain, this is against the rules but valid. If the exempt produce was cut while in the possession of its owner, a latent obligation is on it which can be activated by his giving heave and tithes “illegally”, i. e., against the rules.<br>In the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Nedarim 44b\" href=\"/Nedarim.44b\">Babli (<i>Nedarim</i> 44b</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Bava Kamma 28a\" href=\"/Bava_Kamma.28a\"><i>Baba Qama</i> 28a</a>,<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Bava Kamma 94a\" href=\"/Bava_Kamma.94a\">94a</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Temurah 6a\" href=\"/Temurah.6a\"><i>Temurah</i> 6a</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Chullin 134b\" href=\"/Chullin.134b\"><i>Ḥulin</i> 134b</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Niddah 51a\" href=\"/Niddah.51a\"><i>Niddah</i> 51a</a>), a similar principle is established using the grape harvest as an example. The entire argument disregards the opinion of R. Yose [<i>Peah</i>6:1 (fol. 19b), <i>Demay</i> 3:2 (fol. 23b), <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 4:10:2-4\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.4.10.2-4\"><i>Nedarim</i> 4:10</a> (fol. 38d)] who rejects the concept of ownerless property and holds that the owner has full responsibility for his abandoned property until it is taken up and acquired by another person.</i>. What is the difference between standing grain and ears of grain? Standing grain, if he illegally gave heave before he declared it ownerless, that is not heave. Ears, if he illegally gave heave before he declared them ownerless, that is heave. Rav Ḥinena in the name of Rav Ḥisda, the same applies to a dedicated crop<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As indicated below, a crop which is Temple property is exempt from heave and tithes, as well as from the gifts to the poor. Rav Ḥisda wants to extend this exemption to standing grain which was dedicated to the Temple and redeemed while standing. In that case, there certainly is no exemption from the gifts to the poor, <i>Peah</i> Mishnah 4:5.</i>. The words of the rabbis disagree, since Rebbi Joḥanan said in the name of Rebbi Yannai<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Terumot</i> 1:5 (fol. 40d), <i>Ḥallah</i>1:3 (fol. 57c), <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 4:10:2-4\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.4.10.2-4\"><i>Nedarim</i> 4:10</a> (fol. 38d); as tannaïtic statement <i>Sifry Deut</i>. 109.</i>: (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Deuteronomy 14:29\" href=\"/Deuteronomy.14.29\"><i>Deut</i>. 14:29</a>) “The Levite shall come, because he has neither part nor inheritance with you.” You are obliged to give him from what you have but he has not. This excludes gleanings for which your and his hands are equal. Gleanings, forgotten sheaves, <i>peah</i>, and abandoned property are all equal. Rebbi Joḥanan said, the company did ask: But dedications, where your and his hands are not equal, are treated<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">By Rav Ḥisda. One continues to show that Rav Ḥisda’s statement is wrong.</i> as if your and his hands were equal. Said Rebbi Ila, what are we talking about? If the heap was made when it was ownerless or dedicated, the Torah said (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Deuteronomy 18:4\" href=\"/Deuteronomy.18.4\"><i>Deut</i>. 18:4</a>) “the first of <i>your</i> grain”, not the ownerless, “the first of <i>your</i> grain”, not Temple property. But we must be talking about ears that he declared ownerless and of which he retook possession. If they were ownerless, he would be free, if dedicated, he would be obligated. If they were ownerless, he would be free, since Rebbi Joḥanan said in the name of Rebbi Yannai: (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Deuteronomy 14:29\" href=\"/Deuteronomy.14.29\"><i>Deut</i>. 14:29</a>) “The Levite shall come, because he has neither part nor inheritance with you.” You are obligated to give him from what you have but he has not. This excludes gleanings for which your and his hands are equal. If dedicated, he would be obligated, from the following<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishnah <i>Peah</i> 4:5.</i>: “If somebody dedicated standing produce and redeemed it standing, it is obligated.” What is the difference between ownerless and dedicated? Ownerless [property] is outside the power of everybody, dedicated [property] is not outside the power of the Temple treasurer. Rebbi Abin said, it did not even go outside the power of its owners since he must say to him you redeem first<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The prior owner of dedicated property retains the right of first refusal when the Temple wants to sell the property (<i>Sifra Beḥuqotay Pereq</i>10).</i>.",

Rebbi Immi in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: To exclude the words of Rabban Gamliel as we have stated there: “Rabban Gamliel says, flower buds of fenugreek, mustard, and white beans are subject to tithes.” Rebbi Yasa said, did Rabban Gamliel obligate them because of food<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The seeds of fenugreek, mustard, and beans are food and subject to heave and tithes. Should this imply that any other part of these plants is also subject to heave and tithes?
