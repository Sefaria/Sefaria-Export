                "<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> When does one start to read the <i>Shema</i> in the evening<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Mishnah presupposes that everybody knows that there is an obligation to recite the verses <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Deuteronomy 6:4-9\" href=\"/Deuteronomy.6.4-9\"><i>Deut.</i> 6:4–9</a> since it is written (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Deuteronomy 6:7\" href=\"/Deuteronomy.6.7\">v. 7</a>) “You shall teach them to your children and speak about them when you sit in your house, when you go on the road, and when you are lying down and when you are getting up.” Since it says “when you are lying down” before “when you are getting up”, the obligation of the evening is discussed before that of the morning.</i>? From the time that the priests enter to eat<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The spelling of the Yerushalmi is largely phonetic, in contrast to the Babli whose Hebrew spelling is historical. Since the א was silent in Galilean speech of the time and had lost its role as glottal stop, the Mishnah in the Yerushalmi has לוֹכֵל for classical לֶאֱכוֹל in the Babylonian Mishnah.</i> their <i>Terumah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Terumah</i>, the heave, is the gift to the Cohen from agricultural produce (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Numbers 18:12\" href=\"/Numbers.18.12\"><i>Num.</i> 18:12</a>) and also the Cohen’s part of the tithes given to the Levites from produce (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Numbers 18:26\" href=\"/Numbers.18.26\"><i>Num.</i> 18:26</a>). These gifts must be eaten in ritual purity (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Numbers 18:13\" href=\"/Numbers.18.13\"><i>Num.</i> 18:13</a>: “every pure person in your family may eat it.”) There are several stages in the cleansing from ritual impurity. Serious impurities (defilement by a corpse, a leper, or a sufferer from gonorrhea) need special rituals. More common defilements, such as touching a dead animal or coming in contact with a more severely impure person, need immersion in the ritual bath (<i>miqweh</i>). This immersion removes impurity but does not yet allow a person to touch sanctified food or to enter the Temple before nightfall, as it is said (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 22:6-7\" href=\"/Leviticus.22.6-7\"><i>Lev.</i> 22:6–7</a>): “He may not eat of sanctified food unless he immersed himself in water. When the sun leaves he shall be purified and after that he may eat of the sanctified food.” [For the more severe kinds of impurity, a sacrifice is needed before the Cohen may eat sacred food in the Temple; this does not concern us here.] The Halakhah will discuss the exact meaning of “the sun leaving” and its relation to sunset and nightfall.<br>Today, no Cohen may eat any <i>Terumah</i> and the minimal amount set apart for <i>Terumah</i> must be burned; it is ritually unclean from the start since nowadays everybody is defiled by the impurity of dead bodies. That impurity can be removed only by sprinkling with water treated with the ashes of the Red Heifer (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Numbers 19\" href=\"/Numbers.19\"><i>Num.</i> 19</a>). The Mishnah was edited approximately between 200 and 220 C. E. It must be assumed that the rules of the Mishnah are intended to be practical. It follows that 130 years after the destruction of the Temple there were still places in Israel where the Cohanim could purify themselves by the ashes of the Red Heifer (in Galilee which was only minimally damaged by the two wars with the Romans.)</i>, until the end of the first night watch<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The night is divided either into three (Babylonian) or four (Roman) watches.</i> are the words of Rebbi Eliezer<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The name of R. Eliezer is attached only to the statement about the night watch. The start of the time of the evening <i>Shema</i> is accepted by everybody. Rebbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus was one of the foremost students of Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai, the founder of the Synhedrion of Jabneh after the destruction of the Temple. He was the most conservative of all teachers of his time and reputed to transmit old traditions most reliably.</i>. But the Sages say until midnight. Rabban Gamliel says until the first sign of dawn<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It will be seen that the difference between Rabban Gamliel and the other sages is practical rather than theoretical. They agree that “when you are lying down” means “all the time that you are lying on your bed” and not “when you are ready to go to bed”. The latter interpretation is that of R. Eliezer.</i>.<br>It happened that his (Rabban Gamliel’s) sons returned from a wedding feast and told him: We did not recite the <i>Shema‘</i>. He said to them: If dawn has not yet come then you are obligated to recite.<br>Not only that, but everywhere the Sages said “until midnight”, the obligation is to the start of dawn. The obligation of burning fats and limbs on the altar [and eating of the Passover sacrifice] is until the start of dawn.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">134</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This entire Mishnah, and the following one, are still the words of Rabban Gamliel. In the Venice print and the Leyden manuscript, the Passover sacrifice is not mentioned in the Mishnah preceding the chapter but it is in the Mishnah repeated before the Halakhah. The Biblical precept is to burn the remaining parts of the sacrifices on the altar “the entire night until morning” (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 6:1\" href=\"/Leviticus.6.1\"><i>Lev.</i> 6:1</a>).<br>In the interpretation of the Mishnah, there is a fundamental disagreement between Rashi and Maimonides. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Rashi on Berakhot 2a\" href=\"/Rashi_on_Berakhot.2a\">Rashi (<i>Berakhot</i> 2a, <i>s. v.</i> להרחיק</a>) כדי writes: “Concerning burning of the fats, the Sages did not restrict it to ‘until midnight’ at all and it is mentioned here only to emphasize that everything that has to be done in the night is <i>kasher</i> the entire night.” Maimonides, in his commentary on the Mishnah, writes: “They said about all of these activities ‘until midnight’, even though there would be time until the first signs of dawn, as a ‘fence’ that no one should come to act under pressure and prolong his actions until after the start of dawn; that is what they said ‘In order to remove people from sin.’ ” And he formulates this in his code (<i>Maäse haqorbanot</i> 4:2): “In order to avoid wilful transgression, the Sages said to bring to the altar the parts that have to be burned only until midnight.”<br>Neither the Yerushalmi nor the Babli discuss the burning of sacrifices during the night. However, as Rebbi Ḥuna points out in the following paragraph, in his opinion the entire discussion in the Mishnah is about Rabbinic precepts, rather than Biblical commandments. This is compatible only with the point of view of Maimonides. It is a well known principle that Maimonides follows the Yerushalmi in all points in which there is no contrary opinion indicated in the Babli; he will take the silence of the Babli in this matter as an endorsement of the interpretation of the Yerushalmi.</i><br>All sacrifices that can be eaten during one full day only could be eaten until the first dawn. In that case, why did the Sages say, only until midnight? In order to remove people from sin.",
                "<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> When does one start to read the <i>Shema</i> in the evening?. We have stated<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">תני is the translation of <i>Targum Yerushalmi</i> for Hebrew הגד “to tell formally”. It is a technical term that implies a statement of Tannaïm, the teachers of the oral law who were active from Maccabean times to the death of Rebbi Yehudah the Prince, the compiler of the Mishnah. The insistence on this being taught, or formulated, repeatedly, shows that a statement introduced by תני is a formal statement, carefully formulated for oral repetition, and not just an <i>ad hoc</i> statement in a discussion. The vocalization תַּנִּי is the prevalent one in the Yerushalmi <i>Targumim</i>.</i>: “From the time that the priests enter to eat their <i>Terumah</i>”. Rebbi Ḥiyya stated<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rebbi Ḥiyya is R. Ḥiyya bar Abba bar Aḥa Karsala from Kufra in Babylonia, the greatest of the students and colleagues of Rebbi (Yehuda, the editor of the Mishnah). Rebbi Ḥiyya is credited with collecting the tannaitic material that Rebbi left out of the Mishnah. The collection known as the <i>Tosephta</i> is probably based on his material even though in the current form it is a Babylonian rearrangement. Now the Tosephta (<i>Berakhot</i> I,<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Tosefta Berakhot (Lieberman) 1\" href=\"/Tosefta_Berakhot_(Lieberman).1\">1</a>) is quoted in the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Berakhot 2b\" href=\"/Berakhot.2b\">Babli (<i>Berakhot</i> 2b</a>):מאימתי מתחילין לקרוֹת קרית שמע בערבית משעה שבני אדם נכנסין לאכוֹל פתן בערבי שבתוֹת דברי רבי מאיר וחכמים אוֹמרים משעה שהכהנים זכאין לאכוֹל בתרוּמתן. “When may one start to read the <i>Shema</i> in the evening? From the time that people enter to eat their meals on Friday Evening, says Rebbi Meïr, but the Sages say from the moment that the Cohanim are allowed to eat their <i>Terumah</i>.” It seems that the Talmud does not indicate that R. Ḥiyya is reported here to quote the Tosephta but that there was a difference of opinion between Rebbi and Rebbi Ḥiyya about which opinion of those mentioned in the Tosephta should be accepted in the Mishnah as authoritative.<br>There is a fundamental disagreement between the two Talmudim in the interpretation of R. Meïr’s opinion. The Babli quotes a second version of R. Meïr, “from the time that the Cohanim immerse themselves in order to eat <i>Terumah</i>.” Since the Cohanim have to concentrate on their status of purity between immersion and eating, in order not to touch unclean matter inadvertently, it is clear that they will immerse themselves at or shortly after sunset, when it is still clearly day and no stars are visible, and start to eat at the earliest moment which can be declared to be night. Hence, the other version of R. Meïr, that people start to eat Friday nights, must also mean an early time. Since people return from work early on Fridays, being notified of the approching Sabbath by the sounding of trumpets (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Shabbat 35b\" href=\"/Shabbat.35b\">Babli <i>Šabbat</i>35b</a>), they will eat early. In particular in Babylonia, where synagogues were out in the fields, Friday evening services were held so that people could return to town before the unlit roads became completely dark. In Israel, on the other hand, synagogues were in towns and often the sermon was held on Friday evening. It is told in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Vayikra Rabbah 9:9\" href=\"/Vayikra_Rabbah.9.9\"><i>Lev. rabba</i> 9(9</a>) that R. Meïr was preaching Friday evenings and even women came to hear the sermon at that time. Hence, the Sabbath meal was late. In Israel, R. Meïr’s pronouncement was taken to indicate a very late time.</i>: “From the time that people enter their houses Friday evening to eat their meal.” We have stated: “Their opinions are almost identical.” Come and see: “From the time that the priests enter to eat their <i>Terumah</i>” is still daylight and the stars start to appear<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As noted in the preceding comment, the Cohanim start to eat when it is no longer day, but before it is completely dark. The exact definition of “day,” “twilight,” “night” will be given later in the present section.</i>, “from the time that people enter their houses Friday evening to eat their meal” is one or two hours into the night. You want to say that the two opinions are almost identical? Rebbi Yose<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This R. Yose is the late Galilean Amora R. Yose (probably, ben Zabida), not the Tanna R. Yose ben Ḥalaphta.</i> said: Explain it by people in hamlets who usually leave the roads when there still is some daylight because they are afraid of wild beasts.",
                "It was stated: “He who recites (the <i>Shema‘</i>) before that time did not fulfill his duty.” If that is so, why does one recite (the <i>Shema‘</i>) in the synagogue? Rebbi Yose said: one does not recite it to fulfill one’s duty but only to stand in prayer after the study of Torah<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This section is quoted by Rashi in his commentary of the Mishnah in the Babylonian Talmud. The old Ashkenazic ritual that has preserved the Israeli usages, in contrast to the Sephardic rituals coming from Babylonia, requires that afternoon and evening prayers be said consecutively in the synagogue any time after מִנְחָה קְטַנָּה, 5/4 hours before sundown (the hour computed as 1/12th of daylight hours.) Hence, evening prayers with <i>Shema‘</i> are recited in full daylight. R. Yose declares that after nightfall everybody has to recite the <i>Shema‘</i> for himself (without benedictions) to fulfill the duty of reciting the <i>Shema‘</i> at its proper time. In contrast to <i>Shema‘</i>, the daily prayers are not bound rigidly to their times, as will be explained later in the Talmud.</i>.",

He should not be identified with Rebbi Jeremiah, a Babylonian and student of Rebbi Zeïra in Galilee.</i>: One who is in doubt whether he said Grace after his meal or not, must say Grace, since it is written (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Deuteronomy 8:10\" href=\"/Deuteronomy.8.10\"><i>Deut.</i> 8:10</a>): “You will eat and be satiated, then you must praise the Eternal<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is a problem how the Divine Name YHWH should be translated. The traditional “Lord”, taken from the Septuagint, is a translation not of the Name but of its substitute <i>ădōnāi</i>. The vocalization of the Name is unknown. The root is certainly הוה “to exist”. The form of the name indicates either <i>qal</i> or <i>pi‘el</i>, with a meaning “Eternal” or a <i>hif‘il</i>, meaning “Creator”. Probably it means both but for purposes of translation it is convenient to follow Mendelssohn and use the first meaning. [The so-called “scholarly” <i>hif‘il</i> vocalization, <i>yahweh</i>“Creator,” is certainly false since theophorous names show that the first syllable is vocalized either <i>yā, yô,</i> or <i>yĕ</i>, never <i>yah</i>, and, hence, as is to be expected, the Name does not follow any normative grammatical rule.]</i>, your God<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse quoted shows that saying Grace is a Biblical obligation (at least for people who ate to be satiated). For Biblical obligations, we always follow the rule that in doubt one has to follow the most stringent alternative.</i>”. One who who is in doubt whether he prayed or not, may not pray, against the opinion of Rebbi Yoḥanan<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rebbi Yoḥanan is the greatest authority among the Galilean Amoraïm of the second generation. It is rare to have a decision of later generations going against him.</i> who said: If only one would pray the whole day long, why? Because prayer is never in vain<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Everybody agrees that praying the <i>Amidah</i> three times a day is a rabbinic obligation. The majority opinion, reported here by R. Zeïra and anonymously in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Berakhot 21a\" href=\"/Berakhot.21a\"><i>Babli Berakhot</i> 21a</a>, is that one may not recite this prayer more than three times a day (at least on weekdays) and that, therefore, when in doubt one may not pray since rabbinic ordinances are interpreted leniently in case of doubt. The contrary opinion of Rebbi Yoḥanan is also reported in the Babylonian Talmud (<i>loc. cit.</i>) but without the argument that prayer is never in vain. Rav Haï Gaon (<i>Otzar HaGeonim Berakhot</i>, Responsa p. 50, Commentaries p. 26) explains that Rebbi Yoḥanan thinks that prayer, as a supplication for Divine grace and in imitation of sacrifices, can be offered as fulfillment of a vow. It follows that, in his opinion, anyone who is in doubt whether he prayed already, should declare that his prayer should be counted as obligatory if he did not pray but as a voluntary offering if he already had fulfilled his obligation. This opinion is not acceptable to the Yerushalmi; since prayer is never in vain it does not need a prior declaration. There is a practical difference between the two Talmudim since according to Rav Haï’s interpretation, someone who started praying and remembered in the middle that he already had prayed, must stop in the middle even according to Rebbi Yoḥanan, but in the Jerusalem Talmud R. Yoḥanan is explicitly on record (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 4:3:2-4:5\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.4.3.2-4.5\"><i>Halakhah</i> 4:3</a>) that he goes on praying since prayer is never in vain.</i>! About one who is in doubt whether he recited (the <i>Shema‘</i>) or not we may hear from this: He who recites (the <i>Shema‘</i>) before that time did not fulfill his duty. And before that time is it not doubtful<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Later it will be discussed that sometime between sundown and nightfall there is a time of twilight when it is doubtful whether it belongs to day or night. Hence, someone who recites the <i>Shema‘</i> during twilight cannot be said to certainly have violated the rule that the evening <i>Shema‘</i> must be recited in the night and his case is equivalent to the one where the person is not sure whether he had recited the <i>Shema‘</i> already during the current evening.</i>? This means that one who is in doubt whether he recited (the <i>Shema</i>) or not must recite again<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the Talmud has to prove indirectly that in reading the <i>Shema‘</i> one is stringent in case of doubt it seems that it is implied that the reading of <i>Shema‘</i> is a rabbinic institution (though it might leave in doubt the status of the first sentence or the first section.)</i>.",
                "A sign for it (nightfall) is after stars have become visible<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is an extended quote from a parallel to the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Tosefta Berakhot (Lieberman) 1:1\" href=\"/Tosefta_Berakhot_(Lieberman).1.1\">Tosephta (1:1</a>) quoted in note 8. It is not from our Tosephta since the last sentence is missing there and the first sentence reads in the Tosephta, and in the Babylonian Talmud (2b), סימן לדבר צאת הכוֹכבים. Levi Ginzberg already has pointed out that the Biblical noun construction צאת הכוֹכבים “the emergence of stars” is never used in the Yerushalmi which prefers the verbal form. “It” referred to in this quote must be nightfall, the common time both for the criterion of R. Meïr and that of the Sages (Note 8).</i>. And though there is no proof, at least there is a hint<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This expression is found also in Yerushalmi <i>Sheviït</i> 9:2 (38d), <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Pesachim 1:1:2-17\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Pesachim.1.1.2-17\"><i>Pesaḥim</i>1:1</a> (27a), <i>Moëd Qaṭan</i> 1:4 (80c), <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 4:11:2-10\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.4.11.2-10\"><i>Yebamot</i> 4:11</a> (6a), <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Niddah 1:3:2-8\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Niddah.1.3.2-8\"><i>Niddah</i> 1:4</a> (49a).</i> in (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Nehemiah 4:15\" href=\"/Nehemiah.4.15\"><i>Neh.</i> 4:15</a>): “We wereworking; half of them were holding spears, from the beginning of dawn to the visibility of stars.” And it is written (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Nehemiah 4:16\" href=\"/Nehemiah.4.16\"><i>v.</i> 16</a>): “The night was for us for watch duty and daytime for work.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The argument goes as follows: Nehemiah’s people worked from dawn to dusk (in contrast to hired workers who labor from sunrise to sunset; <i>Baba meẓia‘</i> 7:1). The second verse, missing in the Tosephta, contains the proof: Neḥemiah declares that “day was for work” and, since he had defined his working day as dawn to dusk in the preceding verse, his definition at least for “day” is “dawn to dusk”. This is only a “hint”, not a proof, since his working day was irregular.</i>”",

Pinḥas Hacohen bar Ḥama, an Israeli Amora of the fourth generation. His source R. Abba bar Pappus was a Babylonian of the second Amora generation immigrating into Galilee. In the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Shabbat 35b\" href=\"/Shabbat.35b\">Babli (<i>Šabbat</i> 35b</a>), the criterion of three stars is attributed to Samuel, one of the two foremost Babylonian authorities of the first generation. This criterion is originally Babylonian since the criterion of Cohanim eating their <i>Terumah</i> was never applicable in Babylonia.</i> in the name of Rebbi Abba bar Pappus: one star (visible) is certainly daylight. Two are doubtful as night. Three is certainly night. Are two doubtful?

Longworth, London 1967, pp. 171–196; <i>Seder Olam</i>, North-vale NJ 1998, p. 6) that every Biblical statement must have a definite meaning. Since numbers do not have an upper bound, the only definite number indicated by a plural is 2. Hence, the plural must mean two unless it is accompanied by a description like “many”, etc. The description in the Babli is: תפסת מוּעט תפסת תפסת מרוּבה לא תפסת “If you grab the minimum you have something in your hand; if you grab more you have nothing in your hand.” It follows that Neḥemiah can talk only about two stars in his description of night.</i>” The minimum of “stars” are two!

Yose bar Abun is reported in the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Shabbat 35b\" href=\"/Shabbat.35b\">Babli (<i>Šabbat</i> 35b</a>) by R. Yose bar Zabida. The names Abun, Abba are often contracted to Bun, Ba in the Yerushalmi.</i> investigated: If you say that two (stars) present a doubt, if someone saw two stars on Friday night, was warned, and did forbidden work, he also saw two stars on Saturday night, was warned, and did forbidden work, then it is logical to assert that if the first period was daytime the last period was also daytime and he would be guilty for the later work; if the last period was nighttime then the first period was also nighttime and he would be guilty for the first work<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As Rashi points out in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Shabbat 35b\" href=\"/Shabbat.35b\"><i>Šabbat</i> 35b</a>, one has to assume that the person did work the entire period during which exactly two stars were visible. Since it is not determined when exactly the changeover from Sabbath to workday occurs during this period, one has to exclude the possibility that he did the work during daytime the first time and during nighttime the second time.<br>The first case discussed by R. Yose bar Abun deals with a criminal trial. In Jewish law, the Biblical penalties cannot be imposed unless the accused was duly warned by witnesses not to commit the crime that he was seen to start. However, such a warning must be given unconditionally. Since nobody can assert categorically that work in twilight is a Biblical prohibition on Friday night and Saturday night, R. Yose seems to assert that two conditional warnings, given in mutually exclusive circumstances which together make a certainty of the transgression, can be counted as an unconditional warning.</i>. If someone saw two stars on Friday night and harvested about (the volume of) half a fig, in the morning he harvested about half a fig, and he saw two stars on Saturday night and harvested about half a fig, then it is logical to assert that if the first period was daytime the last period was also daytime and one would combine daytime with Saturday night and he would be guilty for his last work; if the last period was nighttime then the first period was also nighttime and one would combine daytime with Friday night and he would be guilty for his first work<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Harvesting is forbidden on the Sabbath. Like all such work, the minimal amount of work that is punishable depends on the intention of the person acting. If the harvest is to clear the field for a new crop then the most minute amount of work is punishable. If the harvest is for human consumption then the minimal harvest punishable is the volume of a dried fig. If the harvest is for animal feed then the minimal amount is to fill the mouth of a lamb (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Tosefta Shabbat (Lieberman) 10:15\" href=\"/Tosefta_Shabbat_(Lieberman).10.15\"><i>Tosephta Šabbat</i> 10:15</a>). Here it is understood that one uses the example of one who harvests for human consumption. Any forbidden work on the Sabbath is sinful even in the tiniest of amounts; the minimal amounts determine only whether there is a criminal liability or not. If the work was done inadvertently or the person forgot that it was Sabbath, he may bring a sin offering in the Temple as soon as the Temple will be rebuilt. However, a sin offering can only be brought if the same action, done intentionally, would have been a criminal act. Hence, no sin offering can be brought as atonement for doing less than a minimal amount of work which would qualify as criminal act. For such an action there can be no warning and the formulation of the problem also leaves out mention of due warning; one may speak here only about the obligation (or possibility) of bringing a sin-offering.<br>It is spelled out in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 5:2-4\" href=\"/Leviticus.5.2-4\"><i>Leviticus</i> (5:2–4</a>) in respect to sin offerings for transgressions by speech (by oath, or non-speech, be refusing to be a witness) that the sin offering is brought if “(he did,) and it was forgotten by him, and he remembered and was guilty.” It is taken from here that in all cases there is one sin offering for all transgressions done in one forgetting; that any realization of the forbidden action in the time in between will cause a separate sin with a separate sin offering. Hence, it is assumed here that the person in question either was not aware that the day was a Sabbath or that harvesting on the Sabbath is forbidden, without any intermediate awareness of either Sabbath or the prohibition of harvesting. It is then asserted by R. Yose bar Abun that all acts committed during one forgetting do combine, since they will all be covered by one sin-offering.<br>The certainty of guilt on the Sabbath is then established by the same argument as in the first case under the same conditions, viz., that in both cases the action was performed exactly during the entire time that exactly two stars were visible. The practical determination of such an action is made questionable by the next action.</i>.",

The interpretation and the text are a matter of some controversy. Rabbenu Ḥananel (of Kairawan, 11th Century) in his commentary to <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Shabbat 35b\" href=\"/Shabbat.35b\"><i>Šabbat</i> 35b</a> reads in the statement of R. Yose bar Abun: וּבלחוּד דיתחמוּן תלתא כוֹכבים בר מן חד כוֹכבתא, this is close to our text. R. Eliezer ben Joel (Ravia, Rhineland, 12th-13th Cent., § 199) reads וּבלחוּד דיתחמוּ תלתא כוֹכבין בדמוּת חד כוֹכבתא “only that three stars should look like one star” and explains in the name of Rebbi Yehuda (either the Pious of Regensburg or Sir Leon of Paris) that three stars have to appear in a group like feet of a tripod. The same text is quoted by the 14th cent. R. Nissim Gerondi (Ran) as דדמיין לחדא כוֹכבתא “which are similar to one star” and his contemporary <i>Hagahot Maimuniot</i>(<i>Hilkhot Šabbat,</i> 5:4 Note 3) that three stars should be seen כמין חד כוֹכבא “in the manner of one star”, to which reading the explanation of Ravia applies well. In fact, R. Zachariah Frankel in his commentary on the Yerushalmi points out that the feminine כוֹכבתא makes sense only if it refers to Venus. A “star” in general is כוֹכבא, masculine, and it seems that the text of <i>Hagahot Maimuniot</i> has been corrected by German Jewish attention to grammatical correctness. However, if we accept the reading כוֹכבתא the statement of R. Yose bar Abun is a duplication of the earlier remark that “the first star does not count.” Ran explains that the earlier statement determines the moment of nightfall from Biblical sources but that the requirement that three stars should be seen close together is a rabbinic ordinance “to add from weekday to the holy day” and, therefore, has a different status and is a legitimate addition.</i>.",

If the zenith is silver colored equal to the horizon, then it is night.” The text of the Yerushalmi is from a tannaitic source and supports Samuel’s reading.

R. Ḥanina probably is the Amora R. Ḥanina, the student of Rebbi.<br>The explanation of this section depends on whether one accepts that Rebbi and R. Ḥanina speak of the same tradition, only that R. Ḥanina insists that the correct tradition of Rebbi’s statement is that dusk starts only at the moment of the final disappearance of the sun and not at the moment of the disappearance of the lower rim of the solar disk as in the first tradition. This is the opinion of most commentators of the Yerushalmi; in the language of the Babli it means that two tradents, the first one anonymous and the second R. Ḥanina, give their versions of what Rebbi really said. [Nachmanides (<i>Writings of Rabbenu Moshe ben Naḥman</i>, ed. Chavel, Jerusalem 1964, <i>Torat Haädam</i>, p. 154–251) insists that R. Ḥanina only explains Rebbi’s statement in popular terms. Since the Talmud quotes a teaching accepted by Samuel the astronomer as confirmation of R. Ḥanina’s position, it is difficult to accept that the first tradent and R. Ḥanina should have completely parallel statements.]<br>A reasonable explanation of this section must start with a discussion of “the turning point of the moon.” Usually this is taken as the moment of the full moon, when the moon changes from increasing to decreasing. However, this interpretation is impossible since the orbit of the moon usually deviates from the ecliptic and only about every 223 months the full moon is in the ecliptic in opposition to the sun. Hence, the “turning point of the moon” is the only time when there is a possibility of a lunar eclipse and the full moon is directly opposite to the sun. R. Ḥanina and Samuel express the view of geometric astronomy, i.e., that the full moon cannot rise as long as the sun is still visible. The anonymous first tradent notes that in rare cases the refraction of the earth’s atmosphere can lead to a situation where the full moon starts to rise while the sun, geometrically below the horizon, is still visible. [In science, this phenomenon was first studied by Ibn al Haytham in the tenth Cent.; cf. R. Rashed, <i>Optique et mathématiques</i>, Variorum: Ashgate Publ. Co., Brookfield Vt, 1992] For practical purposes, both teachers seem to agree that in the consideration of “sundown” for Sabbath observance, the influence of refraction in the atmosphere should be disregared.</i>.",

Rebbi Yose here is Rebbi Yose bar Ḥalaphta, the highest authority in his generation.<br>In the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Shabbat 34b\" href=\"/Shabbat.34b\">Babli (<i>Šabbat</i> 34b</a>), the previous statement describing dusk as the time between the end of a reddish glow in the East to uniform dark greyness from Eastern horizon to zenith is attributed to Rebbi Yehudah (bar Ilaï), followed by the statements of R. Neḥemiah and R. Yose here, making the definition of dusk a triple disagreement. By contrast, it seems that the Yerushalmi accepts the criterion of the color of the Eastern sky as universally valid, only that Rebbi Neḥemiah qualifies it in time. The relationship between the statements of R. Neḥemiah and R. Yose is discussed in the next section. Since the standard for a normal person is to walk 10 <i>parasangs</i> [= 40 miles (<i>mil</i>)] in a day of 12 hours, the time allocated to a <i>mil</i> is 12/40 hours or (12×60)/40 = 18 minutes. [Maimonides counts the 10 <i>parasangs</i> from beginning of dawn to the end of dusk; his time for walking a <i>mil</i> is 24 minutes.] This refers to a day of 12 hours between sunrise and sunset, i.e., for the equinoxes if constant hours are used. In addition, the determination of time is valid only for the Land of Israel or other countries of the same latitude. For other latitudes, the length of dusk has to be determined by the angle of depression of the sun at the end of 9 or 12 minutes after sunset in Israel on March 21. The Babylonian Talmud (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Shabbat 34b\" href=\"/Shabbat.34b\"><i>Šabbat</i> 34b</a>) replaces the time of ½ (Roman?) <i>mil</i> in Galilee by ⅔ Babylonian?) <i>mil</i> in Babylonia on the lower Euphrates.</i> From after sundown the time a man needs to walk half a <i>mil</i>, the words of Rebbi Neḥemiah.

If he had two episodes not separated by a full day, he can cleanse himself only by immersion in running water after being free of symptoms for a full seven days.

Rebbi Yose says it is always counted as only one episode. However, Rebbi Yose agrees that if he had an emission during dusk, even though its duration was not long enough for immersion and drying himself, it is counted for two since it happened on different days. In this sense did R. Yose say: If he had an emission during twilight he is possibly defiled (unclean for seven days) but not obliged to bring a sacrifice. If he had two emissions during twilight he is possibly defiled and possibly obligated to a sacrifice. If he had one emission at another (certain) time and one during twilight or one during twilight and one at another time he is certainly defiled (for seven days) and questionable for a sacrifice.

In the first verse, the coming of Lot to Zoar is real coming, parallel to the going out of the sun. Hence, in the first verse coming and going out are the same. It would follow that, in the second verse also, coming must have the same status as going out since it is one of the principles of Rabbinic interpretation that Biblical expressions have the same meaning at every occurrence (a principle known as <i>gĕzērāh šāwāh</i>.)

                "Rebbi<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">92</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since Rebbi Eliezer in the Mishnah had defined the time of the recital of <i>Shema‘</i> as the first watch in the night, the discussion of the Mishnah now turns to the legal determination of the length of a nightwatch. The text here is composed of two sources. The statement about the number of watches in a night according to Rebbi and Rebbi Nathan is a Tosephta (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 1:1:2-31\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.1.1.2-31\"><i>Berakhot</i>1:1</a>). This Tosephta also has the division of the hour and its subdivisions by 24 parts each. This seems to belong to Rebbi’s statement since this subdivision and the division of the night (and possibly the day) is Roman practice. Rebbi Nathan, a contemporary of Rebbi known as “the Babylonian”, follows a Babylonian tradition that also seems to have been the old Israelite practice since the verse from Judges speaks of one “middle watch” which is possible only if there are an odd number of watches in the night. According to Rebbi, a watch is three hours and it has been noted that R. Joshua, who allows <i>Shema‘</i> to be recited during the first three hours of daylight, follows Rebbi in the division of the day.</i> said: There are four watches during daytime and four at nighttime. The period is one twenty-fourth of an hour. The time is one twenty-fourth of a period. The moment is one twenty-fourth of a time. How much is a moment? Rebbi Berekhiah in the name of Rebbi Ḥelbo said: as long as one needs to pronounce it. The Sages say the moment is like the blink of an eyelash. Samuel did formulate: the moment is one in 56,848 of an hour<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">93</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Of this part there exist three Yerushalmi sources [the Talmud here, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Lamentations 2:19\" href=\"/Lamentations.2.19\"><i>Midrash Ekha rabbati</i> on <i>Threni</i> 2:19</a>. <i>Midrash Samuel</i> 3(1)], all of which have an identical text and the definition of the number of moments in an hour by Rebbi as 24<sup>3</sup>= 13824, by Samuel as 56848, and by others either as the time needed to say the word or as the blinking of an eye. In Babylonian sources (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Berakhot 7a\" href=\"/Berakhot.7a\"><i>Berakhot</i> 7a</a>, <i>Abodah zarah</i> 4a) the numbers are quoted anonymously and are given as 58888 (printed editions), 56880 (Munich manuscript), 56800 (Koronel manuscript) in <i>Berakhot</i> and 53848 (printed editions), 56884 (R. Ḥananel), 56888 (Munich ms.) in <i>Abodah zarah</i>. In <i>Sefer Agadot Hatalmud</i> the reading is 5845. The opinion that a moment is the length of time needed to pronounce the word is attributed in the Babli to Rebbi Abin (who might be identical with Rabin, a Galilean authority who escaped persecution by an emperor and became an authority in Babylonia.) Only the numbers given in the Yerushalmi tradition are composites of simple numbers; Samuel’s number is 16×11×17×19, whereas the Babylonian numbers have no decomposition into small factors. Now most of the numbers in the Babylonian sources (who have beeen copied and edited much more than the Yerushalmi and, therefore, are more likely to contain scribal errors) are close to Samuel’s number. One may, therefore, assume that the original number in all Talmud texts was 56848.<br>In the Babylonian Talmud, the number given is from an anonymous Tannaïtic source which also adds: “Nobody can determine the moment exactly; only Bileam the sorcerer could do that.” In Antiquity (and the Middle Ages), all astronomical computations were done in the technique of the old Babylonians, in a number system based on subdivisions by 60. In general, divisions were executed only for numbers that have an easy reciprocal in the sexagesimal system, i.e., they are composed by factors of 60 (2, 3, 5, and their multiples). Instead of dividing, people looked up the reciprocal in a table and then multiplied. Samuel is the astronomer of most authority in the Talmud. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that his number, which is not invertible by the Babylonian method, is a good example that “nobody can exactly determine the moment” because 1/56848 is an infinite sexagesimal fraction. Hence, the comment of the Tanna, that “nobody can determine the moment exactly,” is implied in the number of Samuel and the Babylonian text is a derivative of the Yerushalmi text here.</i>.

My honor counts for nothing before the honor of my Creator. I shall awake dawn, dawn will not awake me. His evil instinct was trying to seduce him and told him: David, usually dawn awakes kings and you say “I shall awake dawn!” Usually kings sleep until three hours into the day and you say “at midnight I get up!” But he answers, “for Your just laws.” What did David do?

Yoḥanan. It seems that the procedures which R. Yasa recommended to his colleagues were not explicitly given by Rebbi Yoḥanan but reflected the general tradition of the Academy of Tiberias. In the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Berakhot 8b\" href=\"/Berakhot.8b\">Babli (<i>Berakhot</i> 8b</a>), Rav Yehudah says in the name of Samuel that practice follows Rabban Gamliël who allows the recital of <i>Shema‘</i> after midnight in emergency cases. From the next “New Section” in the Yerushalmi it is clear that this is not the Israeli position; they forbid the recitation of the <i>Shema‘</i> after midnight. The opinion of Samuel represents either the autochthonous Babylonian practice or the teaching of the Academy of Nahardea founded by Ḥananiah ben Ḥananiah, the nephew of Rebbi Joshua, at the time of the revolt of Bar Kokhba.</i> in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: Practice follows the Sages. Rebbi Yasa commanded his colleagues: if you want to study Torah then you should recite the <i>Shema‘</i> before midnight and then study<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">101</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One talks here about studying in the night. It is stated in Mishnah <i>Šabbat</i> 1:2 that one interrupts everything he is doing to recite <i>Shema‘</i> at its proper time. Hence, we may assume that all these scholars did recite <i>Shema‘</i> in the synagogue. It was stated at the start that one reads <i>Shema‘</i> in the synagogue, when Minḥa and Maäriv services are held together while it is still before sundown, to stand in prayer after studying words of Torah. [This Israeli practice was followed by Ashkenazic Jewry, whose ritual basically was Galilean, until the sixteenth Century as can be seen from Rashi to the first Mishnah, <i>Ṭur Oraḥ Cḥayyim</i>235 and the glosses of R. Moshe Isserls <i>Oraḥ Cḥayyim</i> 235. Because of the disapproval of the main commentators of <i>Shulḥan Arukh, Magen Abraham</i> and <i>TaZ</i>, the practice has disappeared in all Ashkenazic congregations except those of the old German rite.] The question here is whether the recitation of <i>Shema‘</i> after nightfall is needed in order to fulfill the obligation of <i>Shema‘</i> or whether it is needed to protect one’s sleep from evil influences. In the first case, one recites <i>Shema‘</i> as soon as possible and then continues one’s normal activities; in the second case one may say <i>Shema‘</i> only when one actually goes to sleep and then cannot say anything anymore before actually sleeping.</i>. His words imply that the practice follows the Sages. His words imply that one may speak after <i>Emet Weyaẓiv</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">102</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the Babylonian ritual followed today, the benediction after <i>Shema‘</i> in the morning is אמת ויציב but in the evening אמת ואמוּנה; in Israel the same version, אמת ויציב, was recited morning and evening.<br>We find a disagreement between Rashi and his grandson Rabbenu Tam about the practice of praying Maäriv immediately after Minḥah, before sundown. According to Rashi on the Mishnah, the practice of reciting the <i>Shema‘</i> is exclusively to start the <i>Amidah</i> prayer after words of Torah. Hence, the only valid recitation is in the night. According to Rabbenu Tam (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Tosafot on Berakhot 2a\" href=\"/Tosafot_on_Berakhot.2a\"><i>Tosafot Berakhot</i> 2a</a>), the prayers are held after <i>plag haminḥah</i>, not more than 1.25 variable hours before sundown, and according to an opinion of R. Yehudah mentioned later in the Mishnah, both <i>Amidah</i> and <i>Shema‘</i> are valid prayers. According to Rashi, it is possible that the original <i>minhag</i> of the Jews in Israel did not imply that the benedictions before and after <i>Shema‘</i> were recited in the synagogue and that, therefore, they had to be recited at home and could be combined with other prayers. It follows that “one may speak after אמת ויציב” can mean that one does not have to mention the praise of God for the redemption of Israel from Egypt immediately before starting the <i>Amidah</i> prayer. This interpretation is given by several commentators of the Yerushalmi, foremost among them R. Eleazar Askari. However, since the obligation to “connect the redemption to the <i>Amidah</i>” in evening prayers is given in the name of R. Yoḥanan in the Babylonian Talmud (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Berakhot 9b\" href=\"/Berakhot.9b\"><i>Berakhot</i> 9b</a>) it is difficult to state the opposite opinion here in the name of R. Yoḥanan.</i>. It was stated: He who reads the <i>Shema‘</i> in the synagogue during the morning service has fulfilled his duty; during the evening service he did not fulfill his duty<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">103</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This supports Rashi’s opinion. However, <i>Raviah</i>, the foremost Ashkenazic authority of the early thirteenth century, writes that “I have received in tradition from Rabbenu Tam that practice does not follow any of these statements but R. Yehudah in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 4:1:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.4.1.1\">Mishnah <i>Berakhot</i> 4:1</a>.”</i>.

Rebbi Ḥuna often quotes Babylonian authorities and, therefore, possibly was a Babylonian immigrant to Israel.</i> Why did they say, a man has to read the <i>Shema‘</i> in his house in the evening? In order to make evil spirits flee. His words imply that one may not speak after <i>Emet Weyaẓiv</i>. The words of Rebbi Samuel ben Naḥmani say the same. When R.

The declaration of the addition of a month to the twelve month lunar year before the publication of the computed calendar was always made by an assembly of the leaders of the generation at a place called Callirrhoe (Ḥamat Gader). Rebbi Zeïra probably was too young at that time to be invited to the procedings but came to attend the gathering of the Sages, in order to learn from their ways.<br>While in the Babylonian Talmud נחת means “to leave the Land of Israel”, in the Yerushalmi it can mean simply “to descend”, in this case into the Jordan valley from his residence in Lod.</i>, he was received by Rebbi Jacob the groats miller.

Abba bar Jeremiah seems to have been a Babylonian whose father (or uncle) was a contemporary of Rav and who was the teacher of Rebbi Zeïra (Rebbi Zera in the Babli) when the latter was still in Babylonia. The parallel teaching is mentioned, in the same wording but with a different meaning, in the Babylonian Talmud (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Berakhot 42a\" href=\"/Berakhot.42a\"><i>Berakhot</i> 42a</a>) in the name of Rav.</i>: There are three immediacies: immediately after leaning comes slaughtering<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">111</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the usual process of bringing a sacrifice in the temple, the votary has to press with his hand on the head of the sacrifice before the slaughter.</i>, immediately after hand-washing comes benediction<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">112</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is clear from the following that the meaning here is that immediately after washing one’s hands, while drying them, one has to pronounce the appropriate benediction. [Possibly, it could mean that immediately after washing the hands one has to pronounce the benediction over bread that starts the meal. The urgency of starting the meal directly after washing one’s hands is ascribed in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Berakhot 52b\" href=\"/Berakhot.52b\">Babli <i>Berakhot</i> 52b</a> to the School of Shammai; this interpretation of the Yerushalmi is implied by R.

This creates no problems in the morning prayers but is impossible in the evening since after the benediction (starting <i>Emet Weëmunah</i> or <i>Emet Weyaẓiv</i>) there follows at least one more benediction and a <i>Qaddish</i> to separate the recital of <i>Shema‘</i> and its benedictions, an unconditional obligation at least from the institutions of the Men of the Great Assembly, and the <i>Amidah</i> prayer that in the night is of conditional Rabbinical character. When the principle “immediately after redemption comes prayer” was adopted also for the evening prayers (see preceding section), the intermediate pieces were declared to be “extensions of the thanksgiving for redemption.” The benediction immediately preceding the <i>Qaddish</i> was fixed by Babylonian Gaonim to be a benediction for future redemption. The <i>Qaddish</i> itself may be a Gaonic institution.</i>. Immediately after leaning comes slaughtering: “He shall lean … he shall slaughter” (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 1:4-5\" href=\"/Leviticus.1.4-5\"><i>Lev.</i> 1:4–5</a>)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">114</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leaning and slaughtering are two obligations of the votary given in two consecutive verses.

The last sentence of Psalm 19 reads in its entirety: “May the words of my mouth be for goodwill before You, o Lord, my Rock and <i>my Redeemer</i>”. The next psalm, disregarding the title “For the director, a psalm of David,” starts: “May the Lord answer you on the day of worry.” Since psalms in ancient manuscripts were written without paragraph divisions, the description of God as redeemer and the mention of help through prayer are consecutive.</i> Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said: For anyone who immediately slaughters after leaning, no disqualification will appear regarding his sacrifice. For anyone who immediately pronounces the benediction after washing his hands, Satan will not find anything to accuse about at that meal. For anyone who immediately prays after mentioning redemption, Satan will not find anything to accuse him of the entire day<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">117</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This third statement is quoted in the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Berakhot 9b\" href=\"/Berakhot.9b\">Babli (<i>Berakhot</i> 9b</a>), in the name of the holy congregation of Jerusalem, i.e., the Tanna R. Yose ben Hammeshullam. To it is appended the story about Rebbi Zera (Zeïra)’s complaint, only there he had to bring myrrh to the king himself. Since R. Zeïra was a Babylonian immigrant to Israel, it is not clear whether his forced labor occured in Babylonia, on the occasion of a visit of the Persian king, or in Galilee where he only had the opportunity to see the interior of the governor’s residence. The language of the story in the Yerushalmi points to its happening in Israel, while the language of the Babli points to the Persian empire. It cannot be decided where the incident happened.</i>. Rebbi Zeïra said, I am used to immediately pray after mentioning redemption and I was conscripted to forced labor, to bring myrrh to the Palace. They said to him: our teacher, that is an honor.

Hence, the opinions of both Rebbi Simeon and Rabban Gamliel are of purely theoretical interest and no answer is required.

They said: Since you had declared it impure, but now you vote for it to be pure, it is pure.”",
                "So we find that Rebbi Simeon disagreed with the Sages and did not act upon his opinion. As we have stated there (<i>Mishnah Ševiït</i> 9:1) “Rebbi Simeon says: all aftergrowth is allowed except the aftergrowth of cabbage because nothing similar grows wild<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">130</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Mishnah deals with produce of the Seventh year offered for sale by an <i>Am Haäreẓ</i>, a Jew who cannot be trusted with the careful fulfillment of all his religious obligations. The Torah says not only that it is forbidden to plant and sow during the Sabbatical year but also (<i>Lev.</i> 32:5): “Do not harvest the aftergrowth of your harvest,” i. e., it is forbidden to commercially exploit the produce growing on one’s field from the seeds of the preceding year. It is, however, acceptable to collect from one’s fields small amounts for one’s daily needs (and even for storage as long as wild animals can find similar food on the fields.) Rebbi Simeon is of the opinion that a poor person may offer anything for sale since he might (or probably did) collect them from wild growing plants which do not fall under the prohibition. The only exception is produce which is never found growing wild; such vegetables are forbidden for commerce in the production of one’s own field. The Sages, while agreeing that Rebbi Simeon’s position is the one which follows the Biblical precept closely, nevertheless as a Rabbinic ordinance forbid any such buying from untrustworthy people since it is too difficult to enforce the fine distinction made by Rebbi Simeon.<br>Our example shows that Rebbi Simeon refrained from disagreeing in practice from the rest of the Sages even in purely Rabbinical ordinances. The man cursed by him probably did collect wild aftergrowth, or maybe was known to Rebbi Simeon as a landless person who, therefore, collected from growth on other people’s land that was declared ownerless (הפקר), otherwise his opponent could not have invoked R. Simeon’s own ruling. [This explanation follows Maimonides on the Mishnah. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Pesachim 51b\" href=\"/Pesachim.51b\">Babli <i>Pesaḥim</i> 51b</a> has a different text, see the discussion in Mishnah <i>Ševiït</i> 9:1, and <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 1:9:2-5\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.1.9.2-5\"><i>Kilaim</i>, Halakhah 1:9</a>, and the notes to the Mishnah edition of the Institute for the Complete Israeli Talmud, <i>Ševiït</i> 9:1. The Rome ms. has here “forbidden,” influenced by the Babli.]</i>. But the Sages say that all aftergrowth is forbidden.” Rebbi Simeon bar Yoḥai acted on this in a Sabbatical year. He saw a man harvesting aftergrowth. He said to him: Is that not forbidden, is that not aftergrowth? The man answered him back: Are you not the one who allows it? He retorted: Do not my colleagues disagree with me?

                "We have stated “the eating of the Passover sacrifice”. Some people do not formulate “the eating of the Passover sacrifice”. Who formulates “the eating of the Passover sacrifice”? The Sages. Who does not formulate “the eating of the Passover sacrifice”? Rebbi Eliezer.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">135</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For the Sages, the obligation of eating the Passover sacrifices lasts during the entire Seder night; the limitation to the first half of the night is a Rabbinical ordinance. According to Rebbi Eliezer [and Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah in the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Berakhot 9a\" href=\"/Berakhot.9a\">Babli, <i>Berakhot</i> 9a</a>], there is a Biblical prohibition of celebrating the Exodus after midnight. (Cf. the discussion in the author’s <i>The Scholar’s Haggadah</i>, Northvale NJ 1995, pp. 263–264.)<br>Rebbi Eliezer’s argument goes as follows: The Bible prescribes that the Passover sacrifice should be eaten “in that night.” It also reports that the death of the Egyptian firstborn was “in the middle of the night”. Since the second occurrence of “night” is qualified by “middle” but the first is left indeterminate, and we subscribe to the opinion that, unless explicitly given otherwise, words in the Pentateuch have an invariable meaning, the first occurrence must also mean “midnight.” The Sages follow Rebbi Aqiba in pointing out that the first Passover had to be eaten “in a hurry”, the hurry of the Exodus that happened only the following day. Hence, the notion of “night” here is opposed to “day” and not restricted to the first half.</i> What is the reason of Rebbi Eliezer? It is written here (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 12:8\" href=\"/Exodus.12.8\"><i>Ex.</i> 12:8</a>) “in the night”, and it is written there (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 12:29\" href=\"/Exodus.12.29\"><i>Ex.</i> 12:29</a>) “in the night”.

When he left the cave, he was so upset that people would engage in farming and commerce and not study Torah all day long that a heavenly voice ordered him back to his cave for another 12 months in order to get used to the world again. Both Talmudim consider his position appropriate only for exceedingly holy people.</i>; if there were two how much more would there be? Rebbi Yose said before Rebbi Jeremiah: The position of Rebbi Yoḥanan is identical with that of Rebbi Ḥanina ben Aqabiah, as we have stated: “The scribes of Torah scrolls, <i>Tefillin</i>, and <i>Mezuzot</i>, do interrupt for the recitation of <i>Shema‘</i> but do not interrupt for prayer.

Someone who studies Torah with the intent of not fulfilling its commandments certainly has no part in the future world since he does not have the excuse of everybody else that he did not know enough to fulfill all commandments. This is clearly spelled out in the following lines. The question here is, how can Rebbi Simeon ben Yoḥai take a position that for all practical purposes identifies the actions of the most holy man with that of the deliberate sinner?</i> and one who studies in order not to do? Because he who studies in order not to do would have been better off had he not been born. And did not Rebbi Yoḥanan say, he who studies in order not to do would have been better off if the afterbirth he was in was twisted around and he never would have entered the world? The reason of Rebbi Simeon ben Yoḥai is that this one is repeated study and that one is repeated study and he does not push aside one study for the other study.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">172</sup><i class=\"footnote\">But he certainly will interrupt for all other obligations. In fact, the story of his stay in the cave notes that he and his son took off their clothes and sat covered with sand up to their necks in order not to wear out the clothes, and used them only for the times of prayer. This means that Rebbi Simeon did <i>not</i> recite <i>Shema‘</i> since its recitation was replaced by his studies, but he <i>did</i> pray, even though the Mishnah seems to indicate that one omits prayer more easily than <i>Shema‘</i>.</i> But did we not formulate:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">173</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In our Mishnah here in <i>Berakhot</i>.</i> “He is like a man reading in the Torah.” Hence, at the right time it is preferred to Torah.

Yose) tries to relativize the answer that it applies only to someone like Rebbi Simeon ben Yoḥai who spends his entire life studying and memorizing Torah. R. Abba Mari, one generation after R. Yudan, points out that this interpretation of the Mishnah is impossible but that one must take the statement of R. Simeon as an indication of his attitude in general.</i> Rebbi Yudan said that Rebbi Simeon ben Yoḥai, since he was permanently studying Torah, did not prefer <i>Shema‘</i> to the study of Torah. Rebbi Abba Mari said, did we not formulate: “He who reads (<i>Shema‘</i>) after that did not lose, he is only like a man reading in the Torah”? Hence, at the right time it is like Mishnah. Rebbi Simeon ben Yoḥai follows his own opinion since Rebbi Simeon ben Yoḥai said: He who studies the written Torah does himself good that is not so good. But the rabbis equate the study of the Bible with that of the oral law.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">175</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Studying Scripture is equal to studying the Oral Law in merit. Hence, reciting the <i>Shema‘</i> in its proper time transcends both for everybody including scholars of the rank of Rebbi Simeon ben Yoḥai.

After the war of Bar Kokhba, we do not hear of any followers of the school of Shammai in practice, nor of Jews that are Sadducees in practice. In the Talmud (Babli <i>Nidda</i> 33b), R. Yose (ben Ḥalaphta) states that the Sadducees in his time follow Rabbinic practice. We know that the sect at Qumran were Sadducees and their <i>Tefillin</i> follow Sadducee rules; characteristically, they have many more Biblical quotes in addition to the required verses (cf. Y. Yadin, <i>Tefillin from Qumran</i>, Jerusalem, 1978). The <i>Tefillin</i> found with the Bar Kokhba letters in the caves of the Judean desert are of the same type. Hence, Sadducee practice did not completely stop until the war of Bar Kokhba. As far as Sadduceeism goes, its disappearance in practice can be dated to the aftermath of the war of Bar Kokhba.<br>It is not believable that a man of the stature of Rebbi Tarphon would transgress a generally accepted practice supported by a divine pronouncement and by popular consent. Hence, the episode of Rebbi Tarphon must be dated in time before the <i>bat qol</i>. It is generally accepted that Rebbi Tarphon did not live to see the war of Bar Kokhba.

The second opinion, by a late Amora in the name of one of the first ones, explains the asymmetry in the numbers since they must add up to the odd number of 7.<br>Since in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 1:6:2-11\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.1.6.2-11\">Halakhah 9</a> (and in the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Berakhot 14b\" href=\"/Berakhot.14b\">Babli, <i>Berakhot</i> 14b</a>) it is reported that in Israel one did not recite the entire last section of <i>Shema‘</i> in the evening, Rebbi Simon also gives a reason for the asymmetry: In the evening one recites 4 benedictions and 2 sections, in the morning 3 benedictions and 3 sections, for a total of 6 morning and evening. In the next section it is clear that Rebbi Simon makes a distinction between the first two and the third sections of <i>Shema‘</i>, a distinction rejected by Rebbi Levi from the circle of Rebbi Yoḥanan.</i> (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Joshua 1:8\" href=\"/Joshua.1.8\"><i>Jos.</i> 1:8</a>): “You should think about it day and night”, that the thinking of day and night should be equal.

Mana the first, an Amora of the first generation. However, Rebbi Naḥman, the preacher, is an Amora of the last generation in Galilee, a student of Rebbi Mana the second. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that R. Mani here is R. Mana the second. However, since the late R. Yose bar Abin transmits in the name of the very early R. Joshua ben Levi, it is not impossible that the name of R. Mani is transmitted correctly.<br>The statement of R. Mani implies that anybody who recites <i>Shema‘</i> with its benedictions regularly, every evening and every morning, cannot be considered transgressing the obligation of Torah study even if he does not study otherwise. In contrast to the first two statements, this one has practical consequences.</i>: Everybody who keeps “seven times a day I praise you” is as if he kept also “you should think about it day and night”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">204</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Menachot 99b\" href=\"/Menachot.99b\">Babli, <i>Menaḥot</i> 99b</a>, Rebbi Yoḥanan reports in the name of R.

                "Why does one read these two sections every day? Rebbi Simon says because they mention lying down and getting up. Rebbi Levi said, because the Ten Commandments are contained in them<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">205</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since Rebbi Levi depends heavily on the third section of <i>Shema‘</i>, he cannot agree that in the evening one should recite only two sections. In the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Berakhot 12b\" href=\"/Berakhot.12b\">Babli (<i>Berakhot</i> 12b</a>), the third section of <i>Shema‘</i> is singled out for its importance because five of the Ten Commandments are alluded to in it.</i>. “I am the Eternal, your God.” - “Hear<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">206</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As R.

The Babli’s opinion is found also in <i>Mekhilta deR. Ismael</i> (Jithro 5), which possibly was edited in the Academy of Rav in Babylonia. The same attitude as here, that all stealing is prohibited, is found in <i>Mekhilta deR.

The official in charge was one of the small permanent staff of the Temple; the priests themselves were divided into 24 “watches”, one of which served in the Temple from the placing of new show-bread on the Sabbath to its removal the next week. These “watches” are remembered in several <i>kinnot</i> for the Ninth of Av.</i>: recite one benediction! and they recited one benediction.” What benediction did they recite? Rav Mattanah in the name of Samuel<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">213</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rav Mattanah was a student of Samuel, the head of the Academy of Nahardea and representative of the Babylonian tradition in Talmudic studies.</i>: that is the benediction for the Torah. “Then they recited the Ten Commandments and the three sections of <i>Shema‘</i>.” Rebbi Ammi in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: that means that the benedictions are no obstacle<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">214</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since it is implied that the priests fulfilled their duty of reciting the <i>Shema‘</i>, it follows that the non-recitation of the benedictions preceding and following the <i>Shema‘</i> does not invalidate the recitation of <i>Shema‘</i> itself.<br>The <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Berakhot 11b\" href=\"/Berakhot.11b\">Babli (11b</a>) has a totally different approach. First, they note that Rav Mattanah did not know what benediction was recited in the Temple and then they report that Rav Yehudah said in the name of Samuel that the second of the daily benedictions preceding the <i>Shema‘</i> was recited. Rebbi Ammi in the name of R. Simeon ben Laqish is quoted that “benedictions do not invalidate one another”, i. e., the recitation of the second before the first is not an obstacle. The essential difference is that for the Babli, the last benediction before <i>Shema</i>‘, which is praise for the Torah and its study, may take the place of the explicit benediction for the Torah (e. g., for somebody who came late to the Synagogue and is reciting that benediction before he had a chance to recite the benediction for the Torah), whereas the Yerushalmi requires two benedictions unless one starts studying after the recitation of the <i>Shema‘</i> without interruption; see below and <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Tosafot on Berakhot 11b:10:1\" href=\"/Tosafot_on_Berakhot.11b.10.1\"><i>Tosaphot Berakhot</i> 11b, <i>s. v.</i> שכבר</a>.</i>. Rebbi Abba said: From here you cannot draw any inference because the Ten Commandments contain the essence of <i>Shema‘</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">215</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the benedictions for the <i>Shema‘</i> were instituted for <i>Shema‘</i> only, they are not applicable to the Ten Commandments; hence, the Ten Commandments, if recited at the start of the service, require the benediction for the Torah. On the other hand, in the preceding section is was shown that <i>Shema‘</i> contains allusions to all of the Ten Commandments. Hence, <i>Shema‘</i> is in a sense a duplication of the Ten Commandments and a separate benediction would be out of place.</i>. Rav Mattanah and Rebbi Samuel ben Naḥman both say that it would have been logical to require that the Ten Commandments should be recited every day. Why does one not recite them?

                "These are the benedictions one begins with “Praised”. All benedictions one begins with “Praised”, but a benediction following another one, e. g., the recitation of <i>Shema‘</i> and <i>Amidah</i>, one does not begin with “Praised”.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">269</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This statement exists in two additional versions. In the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Berakhot 46a\" href=\"/Berakhot.46a\">Babli (<i>Berakhot</i> 46a</a>) it reads: All benedictions one begins with “Praised” except for benedictions over fruits, obligations, benedictions following another one and the last benediction of the recitation of <i>Shema‘</i>.

The consequence is that for the Yerushalmi all prayer benedictions separated by Scriptural readings from a preceding benediction are considered consecutive (the benedictions after the morning Psalms and <i>Hallel</i>) whereas for the Babli each one needs special treatment.

                "Rebbi Jeremiah objected: But there is “redemption”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">270</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The answer shows that the question is about the benediction at the end of the recitation of the <i>Haggadah</i> in the <i>Seder</i> night: “Praised are You, o Eternal, our God, King of the Universe, Who has redeemed us and has redeemed our forefathers from Egypt and let us attain this night to eat <i>mazzah</i> and bitter herbs.

Then we shall thank You with a new song for our redemption and the liberation of our persons. Praise be to You, o Eternal, Who did save Israel.”<br>This benediction follows the recitation of the first two Psalms of <i>Hallel</i>. It is clear from here, and from the parallel in the last Chapter of Yerushalmi <i>Pesaḥim</i> that in Israel in Talmudic times one preceded the recitation of <i>Hallel</i> by a benediction (the details are discussed in the author’s <i>The Scholar’s Haggadah</i>, pp. 317–318). Hence, by the principle of the Yerushalmi, this benediction should not start with “Praised”.</i>.

In Galilee there existed congregations which were illiterate except for the cantor, where no one could recite the <i>Hallel</i> or the entire <i>Haggadah</i> at home. For these people it was instituted that <i>Hallel</i> should be recited in the synagogue after evening prayers (with its benedictions before and after); then the people could go home and just recite the benediction for redemption, drink four cups and go to bed. The text there seems to imply that the required recital of the Exodus likewise was read to them in the synagogue. The generally accepted implication of this and the following arguments is that any benediction which under some circumstances could be recited by itself has the status of a benediction that is not following another one (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Berakhot 36a\" href=\"/Berakhot.36a\"><i>Rashba</i> on Babli <i>Berakhot</i> 36a</a>).</i>: If he heard <i>Hallel</i> in the synagogue he has fulfilled his obligation. Rebbi Eleazar, the son of Rebbi Yose, objected before Rebbi Yose, but there is its ending.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">272</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is much controversy about the meaning of this question; every commentator has another interpretation. In the author’s opinion, this is a complete parallel to the identical question asked later for <i>Qiddush</i> and refers simply to the concluding statement “Praise be to You, o Eternal, Who did save Israel.” Since this follows the entire text, it certainly is a benediction following another one, so why does it repeat “Praise be to You, o Eternal”?</i> He said to him: there are two, one for the future and one for the past.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">273</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A statement of Rava in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Pesachim 117b\" href=\"/Pesachim.117b\">Babli <i>Pesaḥim</i> 117b</a> notes that the benediction for redemption after <i>Shema‘</i> and in the <i>Haggadah</i> is גאל ישׂראל but that in the <i>Amidah</i> prayer is גואל ישׂראל. The same formulation, גאל ישׂראל, is found in the Mishnah <i>Pesaḥim</i> and is followed by the <i>Haggadah</i> texts with the exception of the Yemenite ones. The unvocalized text of Mishnah and Talmud is read גָּאַל יִשְׂרָאֵל in the past tense. Then Rebbi Yose’s statement makes sense. Since the text concentrates on the future after a perfunctory mention of the past, the conclusion by a benediction for the past is a change of theme and, therefore, the concluding phrase has to be considered a separate benediction. [Rebbi Yose belongs to those authorities who require that the topic of the final benediction should be repeated <i>immediately</i> before the final sentence. His opinion is superseded here by that of Rebbi Mana later in the discussion but is taken up again by Rebbi Aḥa.]<br>The very conservative Yemenite tradition, strictly based on the Babli, cannot be expected to disregard a prescription of that Talmud. Hence, it is possible that Rava did read גָּאֵל יִשְׂרָאֵל, a <i>pa’el</i> form of the present [cf. S. Morag, בנין פָּאֵל וּבנין נִתְפָּאֵל, <i>Tarbiẓ 26</i>(1957), 349–356 and the material quoted in the author’s <i>The Scholar’s Haggadah</i>, p. 322.] The Yerushalmi here shows that the Israeli reading was גָּאַל יִשְׂרָאֵל. Hence, identical (consonantal) wording in Babli and Yerushalmi does not necessarily imply same text and same meaning. Since Italian and Northern European Jewry obtained their prayer texts from Israel, probably in the Mishnaic period, it is the rule that their prayer texts follow Yerushalmi sources.</i>",

The answer is that the benedictions over spices and fire are recited in order only for convenience, not out of necessity, and that Rebbi did recite them separately. Hence, <i>Havdalah</i> is a potentially freestanding benediction, but it follows always the benediction for wine. The objection based on this is not raised, but it will be raised for <i>Qiddush</i> and the answer given there also applies here.

The answer is that <i>Qiddush</i> during a meal does not require the benediction over wine even though there is an interruption in the meal since one is forbidden to eat and drink after sundown Friday night before making <i>Qiddush</i>. The Babli does not take up this question, hence practice follows this Yerushalmi, <i>Shulḥan Arukh Oraḥ Ḥayyim</i> 271, Sec. 4.

But the Yerushalmi speaks of one “who is standing in morning prayers and forgot”, i. e., that he started out correctly, forgot himself in the middle, and remembered in time to close with the correct text. The principles of prayer texts were instituted by the Men of the Great Assembly. They determined the contents of the prayers but not, in general, their texts. (For the <i>Amidah</i>, the Mishnah even reports that Rebbi Eliezer says that one who repeats the same text for more than 30 days cannot really be an honest supplicant).

It is possible that “Aḥa”, a name without meaning, is simply a form of endearment of the formal name “Naḥman”, and that in the Babli it is necessary to use the form of endearment to distinguish this Amora from Rav Naḥman, quoted without his father’s name because of his exalted status, whose full name seems to have been Rav Naḥman bar Jacob.</i> Rav Naḥman bar Jacob said: But only at the <i>daleth</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The soft ד, without <i>dagesh</i>, was pronounced like an Arabic ذ, or a voiced English <i>th</i>, a sibilant sometimes close to ז.

This was because in Babylonia, as in Medieval Ashkenaz, a ח was pronounced like a stronger ה and therefore tended to be silent in the middle of a word, as ה is mostly silent in the middle of a word in modern Hebrew. (Even the masters of the Massorah tried to counteract this tendency, e. g. by punctuating יִֽהְיֶה, to make the <i>Sheva</i> heard when it should be silent by grammatical rules, so that the Torah reader should be forced to pronounce the ה, but obviously to no avail.)</i> Symmachos bar Joseph<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A Tanna, student of Rebbi Meïr.</i> said: Anyone who prolongs “is One” has his days and years prolonged in wellbeing.

In the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Berakhot 23b\" href=\"/Berakhot.23b\">Babli (<i>Berakhot</i> 23b</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Sukkah 41b\" href=\"/Sukkah.41b\"><i>Sukkah</i> 41b</a>), the second part of his statement, about sleeping, is introduced as an anonymous tannaitic statement (תנו רבנן).</i>: One may eat a snack while wearing them<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">129</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>tefillin</i>.

Some Tannaïm formulate: One says the benediction once; some Tannaïm formulate: One says the benediction twice<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">131</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is also possible to read פְּעָמִין“several times” but the discussion in the next sentence mentions “two times”. The entire sentence is a continuation of the first statement of Abba bar Jeremiah; he is reported by Rebbi Zeïra to have said that one may eat a snack and doze while wearing <i>tefillin</i>, R. Zeïra then reports that some Tannaïm require that one recite the benediction over <i>tefillin</i> once a day, but some others say that the benediction is recited (at least) two times a day. The objection is that (except for a fast day) one has to eat, hence one has to take off one’s <i>tefillin</i> and put them on again, certainly with a benediction. The anwer is that some people eat only snacks during daytime; hence, it is proved that the Tanna agrees with Abba bar Jeremiah that for a snack one does not have to remove his <i>tefillin</i>.</i>. He who says one says the benediction once, how can he be right? He who says, one says the benediction twice, because he ate and then they are not on him. Rebbi Zeïra said, Abba bar Jeremiah talks about one who eats only snacks.",
                "Rebbi Zeïra in the name of (Rebbi) Abba [bar Jeremiah]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">132</sup><i class=\"footnote\">While all sources have here “Rebbi Abba”, the continuation shows that one must read “(Rav) Abba bar Jeremiah”. This is also required since the next statement of Rebbi Zeïra, unrelated to the subject under discussion, is only quoted because it also is in the name of Abba bar Jeremiah.</i>: A person should not enter a urinal<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">133</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Eleazar Askari (followed by <i>Pene Moshe</i>) wants to identify the “house of water” with a toilet since in Arabic a toilet is called בַּית אַלמַא “house of water”, but L. Ginzburg already noted that this is impossible; in the Yerushalmi as in the Babli a toilet is called בית הכסא. In the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Tosefta Sanhedrin 4:5\" href=\"/Tosefta_Sanhedrin.4.5\">Tosephta (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 4:8</a>) it is stated that a king, who has to write for himself a Torah that has to accompany him everywhere (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Deuteronomy 17:19\" href=\"/Deuteronomy.17.19\"><i>Deut.</i> 17:19</a>), may not take the Torah with him to the “house of water”. This rule is quoted in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Sanhedrin 21b\" href=\"/Sanhedrin.21b\">Babli <i>Sanhedrin</i> 21b</a>, in the reading of R. Ḥananel and ms. ק, in the formulation that he takes the Torah with him neither to the bathhouse, nor to the toilet, nor to urinate. Hence, the toilet and the “house of water” are two different things.</i> with his books or <i>tefillin</i> in his hands.

When his <i>tefillin</i> were on him, he stood in them<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">135</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Babli (<i>loc. cit.</i>) reports that Rebbi Yoḥanan put the <i>tefillin</i> in a pouch which he kept in his hand, not that he was wearing them. But the Babli does not speak about a urinal (with canalization, after the Roman fashion) but of a toilet, i. e., an outhouse. Roman canalization was unknown in Babylonia. Hence, the seemingly parallel passages in reality deal with different subjects.</i>. A <i>baraita</i> disagrees with Abba bar Jeremiah: A man may enter a urinal with his books or <i>tefillin</i> in his hand. Rebbi Zeïra said: Abba bar Jeremiah refers to one case where he can wear them, and to another case where he cannot wear them<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">136</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This distinction is also reported in the Babli (<i>loc. cit.</i>) in the name of Rebbi Zera (Zeïra). If one takes off the <i>tefillin</i> in the evening, when there is not time anymore to put them on afterwards, one must put the <i>tefillin</i> in a designated bag or chest so as to treat them with respect. Temporary disrespect is only authorized if <i>tefillin</i> have to be ready for immediate use.</i>. For if he cannot perform a <i>mitzwah</i> with them, why should he degrade them?",

But if there is no time left in the day to put them on, it is forbidden. For if he cannot perform a <i>mitzwah</i> with them, why should he degrade them? Maisha (Moses), grandson of R. Joshua ben Levi, said: He who wants to do it right, makes for them a pouch the size of a hand-breadth and puts them on his heart<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">140</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A pouch with straps so that in case of need one can put the <i>tefillin</i> in the pouch and carry them hanging under his outer garment, the strap going around his neck. Since one needs the pouch anyhow for storing the <i>tefillin</i> during nighttime, the counsel of Rebbi Maishe is only to put the straps on so that the pouch can be used also during daytime. The <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Berakhot 24a\" href=\"/Berakhot.24a\">Babli (24a</a>) forbids expressly to have the <i>tefillin</i> hanging on its own straps (not those of a pouch).</i>.

The parallel in the Babli (<i>Šabbat</i> 49a) reads: “Rebbi Yannai said: <i>Tefillin</i> need a clean body, like Elisha of the bird’s wings.” R. Z. Frankel points out that at the start of fol. 4c, the Yerushalmi quotes that “Rebbi Yannai said: <i>Tefillin</i> need a clean body”; hence, the reference to Elisha of the bird-wings is really a Babylonian addition. The story is told only in the Babli, <i>loc. cit.</i>, that Elisha was wearing <i>tefillin</i> when, in the aftermath of the war of Bar Kokhba, wearing <i>tefillin</i> was a capital crime. But he took them off when he saw a policeman and kept them in his hands. When the policeman asked him what he held in his hands, he said: “a couple of bird’s wings.” When he was ordered to open his hands, two birds flew away and his life was saved. (This story shows again that <i>tefillin</i> cases were not supposed to be larger than about 3/8th of an inch square.)<br>The implication of this Babylonian ruling is that nobody can be expected to keep his body perfectly clean for very long; hence, <i>tefillin</i> should be removed after prayers.</i> they say: He who is not like Elisha of the bird’s wings should not put on <i>tefillin</i>.",

The explanation of this paragraph follows the interpretation of <i>Rashba</i> (Solomon ben Adrat, <i>Responsa</i>, vol. 1, #711).<br>The problem is the legal status of a holy text in which two letters touch one another.

Hence, if a letter is completely written and its foot accidentally touches the following letter, as with a slightly too long foot of נ in נו, one may scratch off the superfluous length and has a complete acceptable letter. But when a letter has its head elongated, so that from the start the letter was not standing free, then the entire letter has to be scratched out and the writing has to start anew. The questionable case is a situation with a letter that is hanging down below the line, as in the combination תך when the small foot of ת meets the downward stroke of ך. In that case, the ת was complete but the ך was not; this case remains unsettled (i. e., for practical rulings both letters have to be erased and rewritten.)</i>; there is a Tanna who stated: it is valid, and there is a Tanna who stated: it is invalid.

It does not make any sense to derive מחוור from Aramaic חוור “pale”. Hence, Galilean מחבר sounded מחוור in Babylonian ears. (Possibly both ב and בּ were pronounced as “b” in Babylonia, as they still are today in dialects of Jews from Arabic speaking countries.)

This follows the principle quoted before that according to R. Simeon, work not needed for its own sake is not forbidden on the Sabbath. Even R.

Hence, where it is customary, e. g. in the South, the mourner can have one bath, prepared by others, just after the funeral but is forbidden to have another one for the rest of the period of mourning. It then is difficult to understand the question of Rabban Gamliel’s students.

He reduced them to 50, to 40, to 30, to 20, to ten, to one, and this one gave him a hundred barrels of wine. This one vine was as dear to him as the entire vineyard.

Cahana here is Rav Cahana II; his story can be understood only in connection with the remarks in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Bava Kamma 117a\" href=\"/Bava_Kamma.117a\">Babli <i>Bava Qama</i>117a</a>,b; the interpretation is Rashi’s (117b).<br>Rav Cahana was a young member of the Academy of Rav when Rav unsuccessfully tried to dissuade a Jew from informing against another Jew before the Persian authorities. Rav Cahana was so outraged that he slapped the would-be informer and broke his neck. Rav pointed out to him that under the new Sassanid regime the Jews had lost the criminal jurisdiction they had under the Parthians and that, therefore, he was liable to be prosecuted. Rav told him to go (“ascend”) to the Land of Israel, to the Academy of Rebbi Yoḥanan, but he warned him not to ask difficult questions from Rebbi Yoḥanan for seven years. This must have happened between the Sassanid victory in 226 C.E. and Rav’s death in 247 C.E. (Since the organization of the new Persian empire must have taken some time, the earliest time for Rav Cahana’s flight is probably around 235 C.E. When Rav Cahana returned to Babylonia, he became a student of Rav’s successors Rav Yehudah and Rav Huna; hence, he returned after 247 C.E.) In Tiberias, Cahana (whose rabbinical title is not recognized in the Yerushalmi) first kept Rav’s injunction but in the end he found a way to get around it and was recognized by Rebbi Yoḥanan as a great scholar. Unfortunately, by a birth defect or an accident, Cahana had unsymmetric lips which gave his face the look of a permanent smirk and Rebbi Yoḥanan got offended. He gave him an evil eye so that Cahana died. When informed that the smirk was no smirk but a bodily feature of Cahana, he went to the cave where Cahana was buried. The entrance to the cave was guarded by a poisonous snake which let Rebbi Yoḥanan enter only after he had publicly acknowledged that he had been a student of Cahana. Then he prayed in the cave and Cahana was resurrected from the dead. This is the basis of the questions asked here by the hoodlums. According to the Babli, Rav Cahana found the presence of R. Yoḥanan too dangerous. This will explain the roundabout way in which he asked for leave from the Academy in the Yerushalmi version.</i> was very young when he came up here.

Another one in rags saw him and asked, what is new in Heaven? He answered: The judgment over this man has been sealed. This happened to him. He said: Did I not go up to gain merit, but I am sinning! Did I come up to kill the people of the Land of Israel? I shall go and step down the way I came up. He came to Rebbi Yoḥanan and said to him: A man whose mother wishes him well and whose step mother<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">328</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The land of Babylonia.</i> honors him, should he go there? He said to him, he should go there where he is honored. Cahana descended the way he came up. They came and told Rebbi Yoḥanan that Cahana had descended to Babylonia.

He asked him: How much is that pound? He said to him, 50 minas and one slap<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">331</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The price of meat can be taken to determine the time of R. Zeïra’s arrival in Israel. A Mina (Μνᾶ͂) was 100 Denar. In old times, a Mina was an enormous sum. But the inflation in the later part of the military anarchy, from the failed currency reform of Aurelianus to the reorganization of the Roman state under Diocletianus, was extreme. All Midrashim telling about exorbitant sums being paid for simple objects of daily use must be dated to that period, from 274–284 C.E. Diocletian introduced new gold coinage based on a price of 50’000 old gold Denars for a Roman pound of gold. This makes one pound of gold (345 g) the equivalent of 1’250’000 old silver denars. At that time, 50 Minas, or 5’000 silver Denars, would therefore be 1.38 g = 0.04 oz of gold or at today’s gold prices, $14.45. This is a very high price but not out of line in a time of extreme decline of farming and ranching. It is quite clear from this and other stories that the obligation to eat meat on holidays was a serious monetary obligation. (The so-called silver coins of that period were copper coins dipped for a second in a silver solution.)<br>קורסם is Greek κρουσμός, ὁ, “striking, smiting, collision”.</i>. He said to him: Take 60, but he did not accept. Take 70, but he did not accept. Take 80, take 90, until he came to 100 and he did not accept. Then he said: Do what is your routine. The next morning he went to the Academy and said to them: Rabbis, what is this bad practice here that nobody can eat a pound of red meat unless they slap him! They said to him: Who is that?

Both <i>Mekhiltot</i> (<i>Mekhilta dR. Ismael</i>, ed. Horovitz-Rabin, p. 68; <i>Mekhilta dR. Simeon bar Ioḥai</i>, p.41), the Tannaïtic commentaries to Exodus, give the same commentary on the next verse (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 13:10\" href=\"/Exodus.13.10\"><i>Ex.</i> 13:10</a>): “You must preserve this decree in its time, from year to year”. “Why has this been said? Because it has been said (v.9): ‘It shall be for you a sign on your hand’, I might understand this to include minors. And it is logical, since <i>mezuzah</i> is a positive commandment and <i>tefillin</i> are a positive commandment; if you find that <i>mezuzah</i> applies to minors the same way it applies to adults you might think that <i>tefillin</i> apply to minors the same way they apply to adults, but the verse says ‘you must preserve this decree’, I spoke only about those able to watch over their <i>tefillin</i>; from here they said: If a minor knows how to watch his <i>tefillin</i>, his father makes him <i>tefillin</i>.”<br>The argument presupposes the statement that minors are obliged to have <i>mezuzot</i> on their doors (meaning that if they live alone, the rabbinic authorities have to see to it that they have <i>mezuzot</i> on their doors). <i>Mezuzah</i> and <i>tefillin</i> are always mentioned together in the first two paragraphs of <i>Shema‘</i>. Hence, one may assume that they are identical in those details that are not spelled out. Both Yerushalmi and Mekhiltot agree that some explanation is needed to distinguish between the rules for <i>mezuzah</i> and those for <i>tefillin</i>. However, the Mekhiltot extend the obligation of <i>tefillin</i> to all school children whereas the Yerushalmi restricts it to those for whom the study of Torah is a permanent obligation, i. e., from Bar-Miẓwah onwards.

Since three of the four prayers of the New Moon are weekday prayers with an addition added in “Temple service” (רצה, the 16th benediction in the Yerushalmi version) as given later in Chapter 5, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 4:2:2-8\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.4.2.2-8\">Halakhah 2</a>, the only question can be about <i>Musaph</i>.

On the other hand, as Rosh points out, the previous paragraph certainly implies that the one benediction recited on <i>all</i> fast-days except Yom Kippur, not only on those for rain, known as עננו, must be recited also for <i>Musaph</i> since the day requires that the benediction be inserted in all prayers. One may at least understand the position of Rebbi Abba that on a fast day for rain which coincides with a day of the New Moon, one recites the usual <i>Musaph</i> with an additional fifth benediction which deals with the fast day, after the fourth for the New Moon.

                "It is stated<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We have three versions of this formulation, in the Yerushalmi, the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Berakhot 31a\" href=\"/Berakhot.31a\">Babli (<i>Berakhot</i> 31a</a>), and the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Tosefta Berakhot (Lieberman) 3:21\" href=\"/Tosefta_Berakhot_(Lieberman).3.21\">Tosephta (3:21</a>). The main difference in formulation is between the Tosephta and the Talmudim, since the Tosephta requires that one start prayer מתיך דברים של חכמה. In Mishnaic Hebrew, as in Modern Sephardic Hebrew usage, the <i>Ḥakham</i> is the rabbi, and <i>dibrē ḥokhmāh</i> are halakhic rulings; as in the following paragraph, practices universally accepted and not subject to doubt or discussion. From the order of the Yerushalmi it seems that in practice the text of the Yerushalmi should be interpreted as implying the statement of the Tosephta. The tradition of the Babli is uncertain; see <i>Diqduqe Soferim, Berakhot</i>, p. 160, note ר. The Venice print of the Babli requires that one start prayer “out of joy over commandments”. Rashi, the Munich manuscript of the Babli, Halakhot Gedolot and the students of Rabbenu Jonah have simply “out of joy.” The Koronel manuscript and <i>Menorat Hamaör</i> have “out of joy of Torah”, parallel to the Yerushalmi. A Florence manuscript that is typically Sephardic has “out of joy of Halakhah”, directly parallel to the Tosephta. Rabbenu Asher ben Yeḥiel (Rosh) has “out of words of joy”; the insistence on “words” is parallel to Yerushalmi and Tosephta. While the Babli in the printed version would refer to the state of mind required for the <i>Amidah</i>, as implied in the two rulings preceding this Tosephta in the Yerushalmi, the Tosephta and the Yerushalmi require the correct state of mind before one starts with the preparatory sections of prayer, even preceding the recitation of <i>Shema‘</i>. This seems also to be confirmed by the preparatory prayer reported later by R. Ḥizqiah in the name of R. Abbahu. Most of the variants of the Babli text would demand an interpretation similar to that of the Tosephta. All three versions agree that one should start afternoon prayers with a word of Torah or Halakhah directly before the <i>Amidah</i>.</i>: “One should pray neither out of conversation, nor out of jokes, nor out of frivolities, nor out of idle occupations, but out of words of Torah. Similarly, one should not take leave from one’s friend either out of conversation, or out of jokes, or out of frivolities, or out of idle occupations, but out of words of Torah, since we find that the earlier prophets were closing their words with expressions of praise and consolation.” Rebbi Eleazar said, except for Jeremiah who closed with words of reprobation. Rebbi Yoḥanan said to him, still he closed with words of consolation and said (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jeremiah 51:64\" href=\"/Jeremiah.51.64\"><i>Jer.</i> 51:64</a>) “So Babylon shall sink.” Because Jeremiah continued to prophesy about the Temple.

A menstruating woman is ritually unclean and prohibited from having sexual contact until seven days have passed. On the other hand, a woman having a discharge looking like blood is subject to quite different rules that are more lenient for an occasional occurence and much more strict for recurrent discharges. A decision about the character of the discharge can be made only by a competent rabbi. In theory all women should show their discharges to a rabbi. Even in the time of the Temple, that was a practice only of wives of Cohanim who had to minimize their time of impurity by all means. It may be assumed that all other women chose to follow the method described here, to consider any discharge as a recurrent discharge and to wait seven days after the last day of discharge. In that way, no problems arise that would require a rabbi in intimate matters.

By it the negative implication of the verse (which speaks about growing different kinds of plants in a vineyard) are changed to a positive one which now should be translated: “That you shall sanctify the fullness of the seed that you sow and the yield of the vineyard.” Since the sanctity is not that of sacrifices, the sanctity may be removed by redemption (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 27:11\" href=\"/Leviticus.27.11\"><i>Lev.</i> 27:11</a>). However, there can be no monetary redemption of anything not explicitly authorized in the Torah. Hence, the redemption is non-monetary and is the traditional praise given to God in benedictions.

Another explanation<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse is extremely hard to understand; the next two interpretations have nothing to do with the topic on hand; they are only added to indicate translations that might be considered if בל is not a negation but a verb form derived from בלל, which may mean either “to give food” (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Judges 19:24\" href=\"/Judges.19.24\"><i>Jud.</i> 19:24</a>) or, more frequently, “mixed with fluid, moistened.”</i>: “My good is בל with you”, I am feeding My goodness to your body.

The discussion in the Babli is whether pickling or cooking changes the applicable benediction; it is clear from this paragraph that at least for the “Seven Kinds” the Yerushalmi does not contemplate any change in benedictions.</i> and recited a benediction before and after. Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba was looking at him. Rebbi Yoḥanan said to him: Babylonian, why are you looking at me?

This is called “one benediction in the kind of three”; the three benedictions are reserved for grain eaten in the form of bread. The benediction before is the applicable one of those mentioned in the Mishnah.</i> needs a benediction before and after? He agrees. What is his problem? Because its pit reduces it<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In general, anything smaller than the volume of an average olive is too insignificant to require a benediction.

What Rebbi Yoḥanan did was because of a creature<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Babli (<i>loc. cit.</i>) conjectures that R. Yoḥanan ate a large olive which even if pitted still has the size of an average olive.

The word of Rebbi Yoḥanan implies that even one berry from a pomegranate needs a benediction before and after<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A pomegranate is full of seeds; each seed is surrounded by fruit flesh encased in a membrane.

The requirement from the Torah (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Deuteronomy 8:10\" href=\"/Deuteronomy.8.10\"><i>Deut.</i> 8:10</a>) is “when you will have eaten and will be satiated then you must praise the Eternal …”; the Biblical obligation applies only after a full meal. The rabbinic obligation explicitly applies to food that fills at least the volume of an olive; smaller amounts do not require Grace and, according the preceding paragraph, one may not recite Grace for such minute amounts. But since benedictions before eating are all rabbinic institutions, the problem is whether food in an amount less than the volume of an average olive must (or may) have a benediction and, if a benediction is recited on a larger loaf, whether the piece eaten immediately after the recitation of the benediction must be the size of an olive or not.<br>The <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Berakhot 37b\" href=\"/Berakhot.37b\">Babli (37b</a>) has another angle to the problem.

There is no rate set for <i>terumah</i> in the Torah but in times when ritual purity can be observed, the rabbinically established rate was 2 percent. Next, the tithe of 10% must be given to a Levite. This <i>maäser</i> again is subject to a 10% <i>terumah of the tithe</i> to be given to the Cohen.

                "For Torah<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torah study, including Torah reading.</i> there is written a benediction before, but no benediction is written after. What is written before it? (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Deuteronomy 32:3\" href=\"/Deuteronomy.32.3\"><i>Deut.</i> 32:3</a>) “For I am invoking the name of the Eternal, attribute greatness to our God.” For food there is written a benediction after, but no benediction is written before. What is written after it? (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Deuteronomy 8:10\" href=\"/Deuteronomy.8.10\"><i>Deut.</i> 8:10</a>): “You will eat and be satiated, then you must praise”. From where that which is said about one on the other and vice-versa? Rebbi Samuel bar Naḥmani in the name of Rebbi Jonathan: The Name is mentioned in both verses as parallel expressions<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In general, it is assumed in the system of Rebbi Aqiba that a word can have only one meaning. A stronger implication, agreed to by all tannaïtic authorities, is a “parallel expression”. The formal definition of the school of R. Ismael is that <i>if</i> one has a tradition that two equal or synonymous expressions are written in the Torah for purposes of comparison and <i>if</i> these two words are not used for any other inference, <i>then</i> all laws connected with one word apply to the other and vice-versa. The derivation here does not fulfill these conditions; hence, it is labelled to follow the rules of R. Aqiba who is not known to require too much formality in case the verse is used to give a biblical base to an old tradition.</i>. Just as the Name that is mentioned concerning Torah implies a benediction before, so the Name that is mentioned concerning food implies a benediction before. And just as the Name that is mentioned concerning food implies a benediction after, so the Name that is mentioned concerning Torah implies a benediction after. That follows Rebbi Aqiba<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Who is an exponent of intensional interpretation, whereas R. Ismael is an exponent of extensional interpretation. The rules of R. Ismael are systematized in his “13 rules” given in the introduction to the halakhic Midrash <i>Sifra</i> on <i>Leviticus</i>. The problem of both Rebbi Aqiba and Rebbi Ismael is that in its mishnaic-talmudic form, the rules of Jewish conduct form a logically consistent whole. It was shown earlier in this chapter, Notes 24 – 29, that rules must be consistent from one application to the next, such as rules of Grace and forming a court of law. But the basis of these laws, the words of the Torah, are unsystematic, fragmentary, and sometimes appear contradictory. Hence, one needs a method of translating the aphoristic text of the Torah in a legally consistent new language; cf. the author’s <i>Logical problems in Jewish tradition</i>, in: Confrontations with Judaism, ed. P. Longworth, Blond, London 1966, 171–196. The rules are discussed in the medieval texts <i>Introduction to the Talmud</i> by R. Samuel Hanaggid and <i>Sefer Keritut</i> of R. Simson of Sens.</i>. What following Rebbi Ismael? Rebbi Yoḥanan in the name of Rebbi Ismael, an inference from the lesser to the greater<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">קל וחוֹמר, the first rule of R. Ismael. If there are two commandments, A and B, and if every rule for A is no more stringent than the corresponding rule for B, then a rule expressed for A that has no equivalent for B is valid also for B. The <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Berakhot 21a\" href=\"/Berakhot.21a\">Babli (21a</a>) quotes the following <i>qal waḥomer</i> in the name of R. Yoḥanan only and points out that the application here is not justified since it is self-contradictory. The Yerushalmi seems to be of the opinion that in the formulation given here, with “not more stringent” instead of “less stringent”, the argument is logically admissible.</i>. If food that needs no explicit benediction before, needs a benediction afterwards, regarding Torah that needs a benediction before, it is only logical that it should need a benediction afterwards. That works for Torah; what about food? If Torah that needs no benediction afterwards, needs a benediction before, regarding food that needs a benediction afterwards, it is only logical that it should need a benediction before. Rebbi Isaac and Rebbi Nathan say, (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"I Samuel 9:13\" href=\"/I_Samuel.9.13\"><i>1Sam.</i> 9:13</a>): “For he will recite the benediction over the sacrifice and after that the invited guests will eat.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Berakhot 48b\" href=\"/Berakhot.48b\">Babli (48b</a>) and in the <i>Mekhilta</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) this is given in the name of R. Nathan only. A verse from Samuel (Biblical but not Pentateuchal) cannot prove a commandment but can prove a practice.</i> Rebbi Nathan<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the Babli and the Mekhilta, this appears in the name of Rebbi Isaac.</i> said, (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 23:24\" href=\"/Exodus.23.24\"><i>Ex.</i> 23:24</a>) “you shall serve the Eternal, your God and give praise for your bread and your water”; when is it called your bread and your water, before you eat<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The full verse seems to read: “You shall serve the Eternal, your God, then He will bless your bread and your water and I will remove sickness from your midst.” The switch from third to first person is awkward in any case. In the Babli (in particular, in the Sephardic incunabula print) it is spelled out: Do not read וּבֵרַךְ “He will bless” but וּבָרֵךְ “and praise”. However, the Bible Concordance of G. Lisowsky (Stuttgart 1958) takes the verse, as it stands, to mean “You shall serve the Eternal, your God, and praise for your bread and your water, then I will remove sickness from your midst.” One may recite a benediction one one’s bread and one’s water only before it is consumed; afterwards one may speak only of nourishment and sustenance.</i>. Rebbi said, if he has to give praise when he ate and is satiated, somuch more at a time when he is hungry for food. That is for food, what about Torah? If food, which sustains only temporary life, needs a benediction before and after, Torah, which sustains eternal life, so much more<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the Babli and the <i>Mekhilta</i> this is a קל וחוֹמר of Rebbi Ismael.</i>.",
                "Rebbi Zeïra asked: These three that are called<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For reading the Torah in public. Since the preceding arguments tied benedictions over Torah reading to Grace, one has to ask in which way they are comparable. In the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Megillah 21b\" href=\"/Megillah.21b\">Babli <i>Megillah</i> 21b</a> there is a <i>baraita</i>: “(In reading the Torah) he who starts recites the benediction before and he who finishes recites the benediction after.” On that, the Gemara notes: But today, all recite benedictions before and after. This “today” may be long after the work on the Yerushalmi stopped. In any case, the <i>baraita</i> seems to represent the early Babylonian practice; we do not know of any direct Yerushalmi source that let people read the Torah without benediction. Rebbi Zeïra, the Galilean head of academy who had come from Babylonia, is the right person to ask for the reasons and the correct practice. Since his questions remain without answers, both practices might be acceptable. Both the preceding paragraph and R. Zeïra’s question presuppose that private Torah reading requires benedictions before and after, cf. מסכת סופרים Chap. 13 and Ezra Fleischer, קטעים מקובצי תפילה ארץ־ישראליים מן הגניזה, קובץ על יד יג (כג) 139–141, 188–189.</i>, how are you treating them? As three who ate together or as three who ate each one for himself? If you treat them as three who ate together then the first one recites the benediction before, the last one recites the benediction after, and the middle one does not recite any benediction at all. If you treat them as three who ate each one for himself then even the middle one recites benedictions before and after. Rebbi Samuel ben Eudaimon said, they did learn the benedictions for the Torah from Grace<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Text of the parallel in <i>Megillah</i> 4:1; the Venice print has here “benediction of ‘invitation’ ”, a scribal error הזימון for המזון.</i> only in public<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Samuel ben Eudaimon seems to object to reciting a benediction after Torah study. Also, since Torah study is a permanent obligation (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Joshua 1:8\" href=\"/Joshua.1.8\"><i>Jos.</i> 1:8</a>), one benediction in the morning is enough to cover all Torah study during the day and evening; one does not have to recite a new benediction for study after an interruption. The prayer manuals of Yerushalmi type (see <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 7:1:7\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.7.1.7\">Note 48</a>) which have benedictions after the reading of Pentateuch, Prophets, and Hagiographs require these only for reading the Bible, not oral Torah study.</i>.

Rebbi Abba Mari, the brother of Rebbi Yose<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">An Amora of the fourth generation who is never mentioned in the Babli.</i>, said: They made it equal to other commandments of the Torah. Just as other commandments of the Torah need benedictions, this also needs a benediction<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Most commandments need only a benediction before, not after their execution. Thus, the benediction for the Torah in private study follows the general rule of benedictions over commandments. The quote for benediction for the Torah before the reading, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Deuteronomy 32:3\" href=\"/Deuteronomy.32.3\"><i>Deut.</i> 32:3</a>, is clearly addressed to the public and, therefore, not applicable to private study.</i>.",

The details and reasons are spelled out in the Halakhah. This disagreement has nothing to do with the question whether one washes his hands before (following R. Moses Isserls) or after (following R. Joseph Caro) <i>Qiddush</i>; in both cases, the cup is filled before one washes his hands.</i>.",

The fluids on the back of the cup should not become impure from his hands and in their turn defile the cup<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Biblical principles on ritual impurity are spelled out in the book of <i>Leviticus.</i> A Biblical source of impurity is called אב הטוּמאה “father of impurity”. The only possible objects of impurity are humans, vessels, and food. Any object that becomes impure secondarily, usually by contact, is “first in impurity.” For profane objects, the two stages are the only ones. However, by rabbinic tradition there exists a “second in impurity” for profane and “third, fourth” for certain holy objects. The general principle is that any transmitted impurity decreases by one degree. There is one important exception. Since body fluids of a person with gonorrhea are “fathers of impurity”, it was decreed that any impurity involving fluids is at least “first in impurity.” Also, unwashed hands are always assumed to be “second in impurity.” If one touches a dry cup with unwashed hands, nothing happens. But if there should be drops of wine on the outside of the cup, these drops will become “first in impurity” and defile the contents of the cup. It is the characteristic of Rabbinic (pharisaic) Judaism that one tries to eat one’s profane meals in a way reasonably consistent with rules of ritual purity. It seems that the House of Shammai assumes that a “full cup” required for <i>Qiddush</i> is full to the rim, kept together only by surface tension, and, hence, it is unlikely that the back of the cup will be dry. (For pottery vessels, other rules apply.)<br>The text of the explanation is from the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Tosefta Berakhot (Lieberman) 5:26\" href=\"/Tosefta_Berakhot_(Lieberman).5.26\">Tosephta (<i>Berakhot</i> 5:26</a>).</i>.",

From this is derived a Rabbinic decree that also all other vessels, e. g. metal vessels that become impure from a biblical “father of impurity” by simple touch, cannot become impure inside if a Rabbinic impurity touches from the outside (but not vice versa.) <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 8:6:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.8.6.1\">Mishnah 7</a> then reads: “All vessels have an outside, an inside, and a rim.

The explanation of the Mishnah is given in Tosephta <i>Kelim Baba bathra</i>3:9–10: “R. Meïr said: How is it for impure hands? If one’s hands are impure, the outside of the cup is pure; if it has moist spots then he may hold the cup by its rim without worry. R. Yose said: How is it for pure hands? If his hands were pure and moist, but the outside of the cup impure, then he may hold the cup at the rim without worrying that the moisture of his hand should become impure from the outside and then defile his hand.” It follows that for R.

The <i>Tanḥuma</i> explains the expression “conditional” for something that is required, by “it is optional in the sense that if one decides not to eat bread with his meal, he does not have to wash his hands.”</i>, after the meal it is obligatory.

It seems that the Yerushalmi has a first version in which the husband simply divorced his wife and in the second version he killed his wife, the intended victim, and himself.

[The formula for the Kingdom: “our God, King of the Universe,” probably was introduced to counter Christian ideas that God’s kingdom is not of this world.] In addition, Abbaye notes in the Babli that Rav will not require R. Yoḥanan’s addition. The formulation of the Yerushalmi shows that in Galilee, they interpreted the statement of Rav that one is required to say “You” to mean that one has to say “You, o Eternal,” since in adressing somebody in the second person one must specify the adressee. Hence, the statement of R. Yoḥanan in the Babli was meant as clarification of Rav’s statement, not a new requirement; it does not have to be mentioned since Rebbi Yoḥanan would disclaim any originality. Only in Babylonia they adopted a narrow interpretation of Rav’s words. [In practice, reference to the Kingdom is required only for benedictions that either stand alone or start a series of benedictions.]</i>: Any benediction without mention of the Kingdom is no benediction.

Ḥanina let the reader finish and only afterwards asked him: Did you finish all that can be said about your Creator? This argument also is accepted by the Yerushalmi since the explanations of the verses that follow are based on the principle that God’s infinity cannot be expressed in finite words. In the Yerushalmi tradition, anyone who deviates from the pattern instituted by the Sages has to be stopped in the middle of his prayer.</i>: “The great God, the strong and awe-inspiring, the noble and overpowering;” they stopped him and told him: you are not permitted to add to the formula the Sages coined for benedictions.

Saul Liebermann points out that the Tosephta may deal with a different period in Jewish history. In the Tosephta, the sequence ’L-’L is termed “not Jewish” and YH-’L as “ignorant.” He conjectures that the Tosephta is directed against sects similar to the Dead Sea sect in whose “Discipline of the community”, 1QS, one finds a formula: ברוך אתה אלי “Praise to You, my God (singular form).” (The prayer manual of the sect, 1QH, always uses the <i>ădônāi</i> as replacement for YHWH.)

The printed version of the Babli has four prayers; the prayer after safe entry only gives thanks for that and is not a prospective prayer for safe exit. This would best be described by the words of Ben Azai. The Spanish print in <i>Śeridei Bavli</i> (Dimitrovsky) fol. 49 has only two prayers, corresponding to the opinion of the first Tanna in the Mishnah, which is disregarded in the other versions: “What does he say when he enters?

In the first version, one does not have to recite the benediction if there are courts that enforce the laws by executing criminals; in the second version one has to recite the prayer anyhow since the police, when confronted with an unsolved crime, might be tempted to frame a stranger who, not knowing any good local lawyer, is in grave danger of being convicted.

Zeraḥiah Halevi to his <i>Maör haqaṭan,</i> who reads Hebrew חרשיא “plowings.” Since the roots חרש (Arabic חרת̇) “to plow” and חרש (Arabic ח̇רשׂ) “to be silent” are identical in Hebrew, both authors give the interpretation” silence” also to the Aramaic equivalent כרב. The author of <i>‘En Yaaqob</i> reads ברכייא, “blessings.” All these authors read first “bad” then “good” as in the preceding sentence; Rabbenu Jonah even quotes the sentence about silence as alternative reading for “small talk.” Many commentators write here that the sentence should be: All lies are bad and the lies of Torah are good, referring to lies such as Eliezer’s when he met Rebecca, first gave her gold rings and then inquired after her family but in his recital to them pretended to first having asked about her family and only afterwards given her the heavy gold jewelry, to keep within accepted norms of behavior.</i>.",
