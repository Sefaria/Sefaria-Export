                "From when may one recite Shema in the evening? From the time the Kohanim go in to eat their Terumah (produce consecrated for priestly consumption). Until the end of the first watch, says Rabbi Eliezer. And the Sages say: Until [astronomical] midnight. Rabban Gamliel says: Until the break of dawn. It once happened that his [Rabban Gamliel’s] sons came from a house of feasting. They said to him: We have not recited Shema. He to them: If dawn has not broken, you are obligated to recite it. And it is not only in this case that they said it! Rather, in all cases where the Sages said \"only until midnight,\" the obligation remains until the break of dawn. [e.g.] Burning the fats and limbs [of the sacrifices, on the Temple altar] — the obligation is until the break of dawn. [e.g.:] All [sacrifices] which may be eaten for one day — the obligation is until the break of dawn. If that is so, why did the Sages say, \"until midnight?\" To distance a person from transgression.",
                "We recite [in our mishnah] \"...from the time that the kohanim (Aaronide priests) enter to eat their Terumah (produce consecrated for priestly consumption).\" Rabbi Chiya taught [in Tosefta Berakhot 1:1]: \"...from the time that people usually go in to eat their bread on the eve of the Sabbath.\" And there is a baraita that comments on this: \"These opinions are close enough to be equal.\"Come and see, [let us test this hypothesis by implication from our mishnah]: \"...from the time that the Kohanim go in to eat their terumah.\" It is [still close to] daytime. It is as soon as the stars come out!? [and the Tosefta says:] \"...from the time when people usually go in to eat their bread on the eve of the Sabbath.\" That is an hour or two after nightfall! [These are obviously two very different times.] And yet you say: \"These opinions are close enough to be equal!?\" --Rabbi Yose said: \"Let the problem be resolved [by claiming that the Tosefta refers only] to those small villages whose way is to go on up [home] while it is still day, to spare themselves from the animals.\"",
                "It teaches in a Baraita: \"The one who recites [the Shema] before this has not fulfilled their obligation. If so, why do we recite it [before nightfall] in the synagogue? Rabbi Yose said: 'We do not recite it in the synagogue to fulfill its obligation. Rather, [we recite it] so that we may stand up in prayer after a word of Torah.\" ",
                "Rabbi Zeira in the name of Rav Yirmiyah: \"If there is doubt whether he made the blessings after his food or not, he should make the blessings [even though he may be doing it a second time]. For it is written (Deut. 8:10) 'And you shall eat, and you shall be satisfied, then you shall bless [the LORD your God...]' If there is doubt whether he prayed or not, he should not pray [as he may have already done so.]\" But he disagrees with Rabbi Yohanan. For Rabbi Yohanan said: \"If  only a person could pray the entire day!\" Why? For prayer is never a waste. If there is doubt whether he recited [Shema] or not, we may gather from this baraita: \"The one who recites [the Shema] before this has not fulfilled their obligation.\" And is not before [nightfall] a time of doubt? And yet you say \"he should recite [Shema].\" This implies that if there is doubt whether he recited [Shema] or not, he should recite [Shema].",
                "[From Tosefta 1:1] \"The indicator of this is when the stars come out. And though there is no proof of it [from Scripture], there is a trace of it: (Neh. 4:21) '...we were doing the labor, and half of them were holding the spears from the break of dawn until the stars came out.' And he writes: '...it is guard-time for us by night and labor by day.\"",
                "How many stars should come out so that it becomes night? Rabbi Pinhas in the name of Rabbi Abba bar Papa: \"One star, surely day. Two, doubt. Three, surely night.\" \"...two doubt,\" [really]? But is it not written, \"...until the stars came out!?\" Rather, [the plural] \"stars\" indicates two! [Not three!]--The first one doesn't count.",
                "[An unattributed baraita:] \"If he sees one star on the eve of the Sabbath and performs a creative task, he is exempt [from punishment]. Two, he brings a conditional guilt offering, Three, he brings a sin offering. On the departure of the Sabbath, if he sees on star and performs a creative task, a creative task, he should bring a sin offering. Two--he should bring a conditional sin offering. Three--he is exempt [from bringing a sacrifice of any sort.]”",
                "Rabbi Yose bar Bon raised the question [thus]: “If you were to say that two [stars indicate] doubt [as to whether it is day or night, then] if one saw two stars on the eve of the Sabbath and [others] warned him [that it was the Sabbath, thus making him liable for its violation], yet he [nonetheless] performed a creative task; [and if he subsequently] saw two stars on the departure of the Sabbath and [others] warned him [that it was still the Sabbath], yet he performed a creative task; then either way you like [he is liable for a violation of the Sabbath]. If the first [set of stars] were [an indication that it was still] daytime [and not yet the Sabbath], then the last stars were also [an indication that it was still] daytime [and still the Sabbath], then he is liable [for a violation of the Sabbath] on account of the last set [of stars]. If the last [set of stars] were [an indication that it was now] night time [and the Sabbath had begun], then the first stars were also [an indication that it was now] night time [and no longer the Sabbath], then he is liable [for a violation of the Sabbath] on account of the first set [of stars]. [Another example:] If he saw two stars on the eve of the Sabbath and partially harvested a fig, [and] if he [subsequently returned] in the morning and harvested another part, and if he saw two stars on the departure of the Sabbath and harvested the [last] part of the fig, then either way you like [he is liable for a sin offering]. If the first [set of stars] were [an indication that it was still] daytime [and not yet the Sabbath], then the last stars were also [an indication that it was still] daytime [and still the Sabbath] and the morning harvest joins with that of the departure of the sabbath, and he is liable [for a sin offering] on account of the last set [of stars]. If the last [set of stars] were [an indication that it was] night time [and now the Sabbath], then the last stars were also [an indication that it was] daytime [and no longer the Sabbath] and the morning harvest joins with that of the night of the Sabbath, and he is liable [for a sin offering] on account of the first set [of stars].”",
                "These [stars] that you are speaking of are [only] those whose way is not to appear in the daytime. However, we do not count those whose way is to appear in the daytime. Rabbi Yose bar Bon said: “Just so long as three stars may be seen aside from that [one we call] Kokhvata (prob. Venus).” (This may be a scribal error and the original version may have been: “Just so long as three stars may be seen [in one place, just] as one star [can be so seen.]”)",
                "Rabbi Yaakov of Romana in the name of Rabbi Yehuda ben Pazi: “One star, surely day. Two, night.” But does he [truly] have no [time period of] doubt!? He has doubt about [discerning] one star from another.",

Said Rabbi Abun that 'He is the living G-d and the everlasting King'.

So too one should not take leave of their friend through talk, laughter or levity and not through empty things, but rather from within words of Torah. So we find among the first prophets who would seal their word with words of praise and consolation. R’ Elazar said ‘except Jeremiah who finished with words of rebuke. R’ Yochanan replied to him, he too sealed his word with words of consolation “…so shall Babylon sink and not rise…” (Jeremiah 51:64). Since Jeremiah goes back and prophecies on the destruction of the Holy Temple, perhaps he sealed his words with the destruction? That is why the verse continues “Until here are the words of Jeremiah,” (ibid.) - he sealed his words with the fall of those who destroyed it. And no one sealed their words with rebuke?! Isn’t it written, “…and they shall be an abhorring for all flesh.” (Isaiah 66:24)? That is dealing with the idolators. Isn’t it written, “For you have utterly rejected us…” (Eicha 5:22)?  “Restore us to You…” (Eicha 5:21) is written below “For you have utterly rejected us…” Even Eliyahu departed from Elisha from within words of Torah. “And it was that they were going, walking and talking…” (Melachim II 2:11) What were they occupied with? R’ Achva bar R’ Zeira said they were occupied with the reading of shema, this is what it says “and you shall speak of them…” (Devarim 6:7) R’ Yodah ben Pazi said they were occupied with the creation of the world, this is what it says “By the word of the Lord, the heavens were made…” (Tehillim 33:6) R’ Yodan b’rei R’ Ibo said they were occupied with the consolation of Jerusalem as it says “…speak to the heart of Jerusalem…” (Yeshayahu 40:2)The Rabbis said that they were occupied with the matter of the chariot, this is what it says “…and behold a fiery chariot and fiery horses…” (Melachim II 2:11)"
