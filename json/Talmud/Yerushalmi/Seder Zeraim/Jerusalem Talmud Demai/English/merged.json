I did not eat from it in my strict mourning, I did not eliminate it (by eating) in impurity, I did not give of it to the dead. I listened to the voice of the Eternal, my God, I did all that You commanded me.” The High Priest found it inappropriate to declare that tithes were given to the Levite when in fact they went to the Cohen.</i>.

Eleazar must say that produce of a Gentile is certain and only that of a Jew is <i>demay</i> (following R. Meïr who declares that a Gentile cannot acquire arable land in the Land of Israel to exempt it from heave and tithes) or that the produce of the Jew is certain and that of the Gentile is <i>demay</i>. The second version is impossible since only a Jew will be expected to give heave and tithes but not a Gentile. In light of the following it is also impossible to assume that the Gentile is only the seller, not the producer. So only the first possibility remains. (Since practice follows R. Joḥanan, as indicated in the next paragraph, the problem is not mentioned in Maimonides and we do not know his reading.)</i>.

They will sell their surplus; if all surroundings are Jewish, one buys their surplus as if it were Jewish produce, but not if some of the farmers sending their <i>annona</i> to the garrison are Gentiles. Then a testimony that one day the supply came from a Gentile source makes all their surplus subject to all tithes for him who holds that produce grown by a Gentile in the Land is subject to heave and tithes.</i>, if for one day it got supplies from a forbidden source, that day will become proof for all days.

It seems that the first two words of the next clause are dittography.

His trustworthiness is not invalidated by the kickback.<br>R. Simson of Sens refers “old produce” to that grown before the Sabbatical year if the question was asked in the Sabbatical. But the question here is about tithes, not the Sabbatical. Usually, “old” refers to grain that started to grow before the last Passover, since “new” grain, summer wheat planted after Passover, may not be eaten until after the next Passover (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 23:14\" href=\"/Leviticus.23.14\"><i>Lev.</i> 23:14</a>).

However, while the thrust of the Tosephta is not that of the Yerushalmi, a Yerushalmi version would not have the phrase, or does not have the phrase, as asserted by R.

In the interpretation of the Babli <i>Menaḥot</i>, the disagreement is not about the status of the Land; it is universally held that ownership of real estate by a Gentile does not free the Land from its obligations. Rather, it is the ownership of the grain at the moment the obligation of heave and tithes starts, i. e., when the grain is stored. Since a Gentile is not subject to the laws of the Torah, R.

For Rebbi Meïr, who holds that possession by a Gentile cannot change the status of the Land relative to the duties imposed on it by the Torah, it should be clear that just as heave and tithe were not lifted from the Land, so the duty of First Fruits was not lifted.

Rebbi Yose says, even in the Land of Israel one does lease houses to them and in Syria one sells to them houses and leases fields to them.

For transportation to the wine press, the baskets are then emptied into a vat, usually made of clay (or any other material that is impermeable.) If some grape berries are injured in harvesting and start oozing grape juice in the basket, that fluid will not make the grapes subject to ritual impurity since the oozing juice is lost and unwelcome to the vintner. However, in the vat the lowest grapes will be compressed by the weight of the upper layers of grapes and will start losing juice. Since that juice is poured into the winepress, it is welcome because it reduces the workload on the press. Hence, the juice will make all grapes in the vat subject to ritual impurity and selling the vat to a person unwilling to follow the rules of purity would help to make the vat impure.</i>, or an olive vat<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">135</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The argument given for grapes essentially is valid also for olives harvested into boxes which then are emptied into a vat. The difference is that olives are not easily injured when poured into the vat, and when warmed by the weight of the olives on top will start oozing sap that contains little or no oil. Hence, the olives become susceptible to impurity only if we consider the sap to be oil, since only seven kinds of fluid enable foods to be impure (cf. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Demai 2:3:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.2.3.1\">Chapter 2, Notes 136–137</a>). The operative statement is <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Mishnah Tahorot 9:1\" href=\"/Mishnah_Tahorot.9.1\">Mishnah <i>Ṭahorot</i> 9:1</a>: “When do olives become susceptible to impurity? When they start oozing sap in the vat but not in boxes, following the House of Shammai. Rebbi Simeon says, the term for oozing is three days. The House of Hillel say, if three olives cling together. Rabban Gamliel says, when the work is complete {i. e., if no more olives are added to the vat}, and the sages accept his position.”</i> to anybody but a <i>ḥaver</i> or to somebody who is known to process in purity.” Is the grape vat not from the Torah<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">136</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since grape juice is one of the Seven Fluids, the impurity of grapes in the vat must be considered Biblical.</i>? This does not disagree with Rebbi Joḥanan<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">137</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Joḥanan had explained in the previous paragraph that even the nonobservant may eat olives in purity from the vat!</i>; just as Rebbi Joḥanan said, the little one is a restriction<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">138</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Restriction” means a restriction imposed by the rabbis, or the Men of the Great Assembly, not a direct Biblical ordinance. It is difficult to know what the reference means. In the opinion of R. Eliahu Fulda, one refers to a statement of R. Joḥanan reported in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Kiddushin 80a\" href=\"/Kiddushin.80a\">Babli <i>Qiddušin</i> 80a</a> on <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Mishnah Tahorot 3:8\" href=\"/Mishnah_Tahorot.3.8\">Mishnah <i>Ṭahorot</i> 3:8</a>: “If a toddler was found with a piece of dough near a dough made in purity, that dough is pure in the opinion of R. Meïr, impure in the opinion of the Sages, since toddlers will grab everything they see.” On this R. Joḥanan notes that the impurity is rabbinic and one may not burn heave if it was made impure in this way. “Little one” then would refer to a toddler. According to R. Moses Margalit, the statement refers to Mishnah <i>Ṭevul Yom</i> 3:1: “All handles of food which would transmit impurity from its original source transmit impurity for <i>Ṭevul Yom</i>. Food that is almost separated, R. Meïr says, if he takes a large piece and a small one is lifted with it, the small piece goes with the large one. R. Jehudah says, if he takes a small piece and a large one is lifted with it, the large goes with the small one. R. Neḥemiah says, that refers to purity, the Sages say, to impurity.” In this case, “small one” refers to a piece of food and R. Joḥanan notes that the restrictive attitude of the Sages represents a rabbinic decree, not an interpretation of Biblical law.<br>{A “handle” of a fruit is an inedible part by which the fruit may be moved, such as the stalk of a pear or an apple. The stalk is wood and not subject to impurity, but as handle it transmits impurity both from an impure person to the fruit and from an impure fruit to any person handling it. The detailed rules are spelled out in Tractate <i>Uqeẓin</i>.<br><i>Ṭevul</i> <i>Yom</i> means a person who had been impure, had immersed himself in water for cleansing, and now is in an intermediate state until sundown when he will be pure (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 22:7\" href=\"/Leviticus.22.7\"><i>Lev</i>. 22:7</a>). In the state of <i>Ṭevul Yom</i>, any heave or sacrifices he touches become unusable; the Mishnah discusses transmission of that disability.}</i>, so “vat of olives” is a restriction<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">139</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since olives and grapes cannot be compared for the fluids extracted from them.</i>. Rebbi Ḥizqiah said to Rebbi Jonah in the name of Rebbi Jeremiah: They disagree about connections. Because everywhere “biting”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">140</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Biting” means that after touching, two different things cannot be cleanly separated. The standard example are two pieces of dough which after close contact cannot be cleanly separated again. Such a connection changes the two separate pieces into one for all considerations of impurity.</i> is a connection, squeezing is not a connection. But here even squeezing is a connection<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">141</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to the House of Hillel in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Mishnah Tahorot 9:1\" href=\"/Mishnah_Tahorot.9.1\">Mishnah <i>Ṭahorot</i> 9:1</a>, if the olives are squeezed so that three cling together as one clump, their sap prepares for impurity and the olives are enabled to receive impurity in the Biblical sense.</i>; hence from the Torah they are enabled. Rebbi Jonah met Rebbi Jeremiah and asked him, did you say that? He said, that is not from me, even their enablings are restrictions. Did we not state<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">142</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Jonah asked from R. Jeremiah, how does he square his stand with that Tosephta?</i>: “They agree that one does not sell a wheat stack, a grape vat, or an olive vat to anybody but a <i>ḥaver</i> or to somebody who is known to process in purity?” Is the grape vat not from the Torah? Then the olive vat should be from the Torah! What about this? Explain it following Rebbi Meïr, since Rebbi Meïr said, sap is counted as a fluid<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">143</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Meïr holds with the House of Shammai that the sap, as a necessary precursor of the oil, has the Biblical status of olive oil. In that case, the mention of the vat of olives in the Tosephta would not be practice to be followed (neither would the prohibition of selling a wholesale quantity of wheat grain, where impurity can be imparted only if water is used in milling or if the flour later comes into contact with water.)</i>.",
                "Rebbi Zeïra said, the reason of the House of Shammai is that a <i>ḥaver</i> should never sell olives to anybody but one who tithes<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">144</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The House of Shammai does not state like the House of Hillel that one may also sell to one who is certain to tithe but who is not formally a trustworthy person and therefore not obliged to tithe <i>demay</i> before selling, since a <i>ḥaver</i> is always bound by the rules of the trustworthy person.</i>.",
                "Who are the modest ones<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">145</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mentioned in the Mishnah. This sentence appears as Halakhah 8 in the Venice print.</i>? Those of noble conduct. Rav Ḥisda said, here we have taught that those of noble conduct are called modest.",
                "<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">147</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the Venice print Halakhah 9.</i>: Rebbi Eleazar said, this follows Rebbi Meïr, since Rebbi Meïr said, they permitted to sell <i>demay</i> only to the grain wholesaler<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">148</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. Halakhah 3:2. R. Eleazar considers the distribution of the finished wine to the two partners as a commercial transaction; hence, the one who tithes may not give to his partner anything that is not tithed.</i>. He explains the Mishnah: The one who tithes must tithe his own part as certain<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">149</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That means, he must give heave and tithes from his own grapes before they are pressed. Otherwise, he would not know what is his.</i>, and that part of his which could be spread anywhere as <i>demay</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">150</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The part of the grape juice he gets after pressing certainly contains juice from his partner’s grapes of which it must be assumed that heave but not tithes were removed. Hence, he must tithe his grape juice as <i>demay.</i></i>. Rebbi Jonah objected: He sells it as certain and tithes only <i>demay</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">151</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If this is considered a mutual sale, R. Meïr cannot be satisfied with treatment as <i>demay</i>, since it is required that everything be completely in order.</i>? It is only possible in the way Rebbi Joḥanan said, the Mishnah is the word of everybody: The one who tithes must tithe his own part as certain, and his part anywhere as <i>demay</i>; that means one half of his part in his partner’s hand as <i>demay</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">152</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since we assume that everybody gives heave and we may assume that not more than 50% of his grape juice comes from his partner’s grapes, half of what he gets must be tithed as <i>demay</i>(assuming that both of them put exactly the same amount of grapes into the press; otherwise, he tithes an amount proportional to his partner’s share in the whole.)</i>."

                "<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If two people received a field as sharecroppers or inherited it or bought it as partners, one can say to his partner, take your wheat on this side and I shall take on that side, take your wine from this side and I shall take from the other side. But he should not say to him, take the wheat and I shall take the barley, take the wine and I shall take the oil<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">153</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to Maimonides in his Commentary, the first part does not refer to the laws of <i>demay</i> but to money matters. In his opinion, a splitting of the first kind, designating parts of the same crop for the benefit of either party, can be enforced in court on condition that it not hurt the other party, but a proposal of the second kind, exchanging rights to different kinds of crops, will not be supported by a court. To oppose a settlement that benefits one party without being in any way detrimental to the other is called “sin of Sodom.”<br>According to R. Simson of Sens, all this deals with the laws of <i>demay</i>; in a division of the first kind, this is simply a necessary splitting of produce. The agreement must have been reached before the harvest, when no heaves and tithes were yet due. Hence, “wine” and “oil” must mean “grapes” and “olives;” nevertheless the unequal splitting is forbidden because it too closely resembles a sale that is questionable if one of the partners is a <i>ḥaver</i> and the other an <i>am haäreẓ.</i> The position of Maimonides seems to be more acceptable since the inheritance of <i>ḥaver</i> and <i>am haäreẓ</i> is treated in the following.</i>. If a <i>ḥaver</i> and an <i>am haäreẓ</i> inherited from their <i>am haäreẓ</i> father, the <i>ḥaver</i> may say, take your wheat on this side and I shall take on that side, take wine from this side and I shall take from the other side. But he should not say to him, take wheat and I shall take barley, take the moist produce and I shall take the dry<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">154</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to Maimonides, this concerns the <i>demay</i> aspects of the situation discussed above. The splitting is permitted since each partner is taking his own. This ruling follows the position taken in the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Bava Batra 107a\" href=\"/Bava_Batra.107a\">Babli (<i>Baba Batra</i>107a</a>) as practice that brothers who split an inheritance cannot be considered as buying from one another. It is as if each of the brothers received what was bequeathed to them even before their father’s death. However, if they switch barley for wheat or oil for wine, they certainly have to be considered as buyers from one another and a <i>ḥaver</i> is not permitted to sell anything not fully tithed to an <i>am haäreẓ.</i> The <i>ḥaver</i> would have a natural inclination to take dry produce not subject to ritual impurity. [In <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Tosefta Demai (Lieberman) 6:8\" href=\"/Tosefta_Demai_(Lieberman).6.8\">Tosephta <i>Demay</i> (6:8</a>) even the splitting according to different places is forbidden if one side is pure and the other impure, since for the <i>ḥaver</i> these are two different kinds.]</i>.",

But the Sages say, not until he spent the entire wallet. Rebbi Aqiba agrees that if he said, ‘a <i>peruṭah</i> from this wallet shall be Temple property,’ he may go and spend the entire contents of the wallet.” מעל refers to the particular case of larceny involving Temple property, whose private use is forbidden even if it does not impair its value (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 5:15\" href=\"/Leviticus.5.15\"><i>Lev</i>. 5:15</a>).

Milgrom, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 1-16\" href=\"/Leviticus.1-16\">Leviticus 1–16</a>, New York 1991, pp. 457–460) or, if in error, must be atoned for by a sin-offering.”</i>: “If a <i>peruṭah</i> of Temple property fell into somebody’s wallet, or if somebody said, a <i>peruṭah</i> in this wallet shall be Temple property,” it was stated that “with the first coin he committed probable larceny, with the second one certain larceny<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">72</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The argument of the Mishnah, that with the first coin he already committed certain larceny, is easier to understand. The difference between possible and certain larceny is in the kind of sacrifice that must be brought for atonement, as stated in the Tosephta. R. Moses Margalit explains the argument of R. Aqiba that the first coin, which was on top of the coins in the wallet, is not really “in” the wallet,” but the second coin certainly is “in the wallet.”</i>, the words of Rebbi Aqiba. But the Sages say, with any of them he committed probable larceny, except that with the last one he committed certain larceny.” Rebbi Yudan, the father of Rebbi Mattania said, that is, if there were ten coins. But if there were only two, with the first coin he committed probable larceny, with the second one certain larceny. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish asked before Rebbi Joḥanan: What is the difference between him who says “in the wallet” and him who says “from the wallet?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">73</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This refers to the Mishnah and the distinction which R.

Once it is poured into the pitcher {the holy vessel in which the water was transported to the altar} its use becomes larceny.” R. Simeon ben Laqish holds that there is no larceny from the water of the golden barrel if one uses the excess over the three <i>log</i> that are to be filled into the holy pitcher.

                "<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Why does he not take two<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">159</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This refers to the second sentence in the Mishnah, when he made half a row tithe on 50 of the 100 amphoras. Why can he not declare that the other half is also tithe for the remaining 50 amphoras and reduce this case to the preceding one where he has to take only from two diagonally opposed amphoras? The answer is that the remaining amphoras are already profane, not <i>ṭevel</i>, and the method proposed is impossible. (Explanation of R. Eliahu Fulda.)</i>? Rebbi Cohen in the name of the rabbis of Caesarea: When he separated half of the heave from another place.",
                "It was stated<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">160</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is a similar Tosephta, <i>Demay</i> 5:22–23, which first explains how to take two pitchers and the declarations to make, as in the <i>baraita</i> here. But then there is no disagreement reported but it is stated that the Cohen who drinks must immerse himself not only before drinking but between the drinks and after them, combining the rules of Rebbi and R. Eleazar ben R. Simeon. That Tosephta explains the practical rule and not the background as does the <i>baraita</i> here. Nevertheless, the text of the Tosephta cannot stand as it is in manuscript and print: “The pitchers, one of impure <i>ṭevel</i> tithe, the other of pure <i>ṭevel</i> tithe. He drinks from one and immerses himself, and drinks from the other and immerses himself, and drinks from both of them together, and needs an immersion at the end.” All commentators of the Tosephta feel compelled to rearrange the Tosephta according to the Yerushalmi.</i>: “If there were two amphoras before him, one of pure tithe which was <i>ṭevel</i> and one of impure tithe which was <i>ṭevel</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">161</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Only pure heave may be consumed; impure heave of oil may be used as fuel but impure heave of wine cannot be used at all. Hence, if the Cohen is the owner of the tithe, he wants to take heave so that he can drink everything.</i>, he brings two vessels and takes from each of them heave of the tithe for both of them. He then turns and lifts one vessel and says: If this one is pure, I am making it heave of the tithe; else I did not do anything. Then he turns, does the same for the second vessel, immerses himself and drinks, the words of Rebbi<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">162</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since no Cohen may eat or drink heave without first immersing himself, it is obvious that here the Cohen did immerse himself first. Hence, the immersion required by Rebbi is between the drinks from both vessels.</i>. Rebbi Simeon ben Eleazar says, he takes it<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">163</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A scribal error for טובל “he immerses himself.”</i> only at the end.” What is the reason of Rebbi? I say, maybe he started drinking the impure one first<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">164</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Then he has to purify himself again for the heave since the first pitcher was profane drink.</i>. And what is the reason of Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Simeon? Maybe he drank the impure one at the end. Everybody agrees that he who drinks impure liquids may not even eat heave that is in doubt<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">165</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If somebody drinks impure fluids (in a minimum of a <i>reviït</i>, about 135 cm<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup>) then, by rabbinic decree (<i>Zavim</i> 5:12), his body becomes impure even if the impurity was only secondary. (Biblical impurity is transferred to a person only by original impurity.) If the impurity is certain, then by rabbinic decree he is impure even if it is in doubt whether the food is heave or not. But if the drink is only suspected of being impure there is no rabbinic decree and impurity is imparted only by original impurity. The discussion here assumes that all impurities discussed are rabbinic in character.</i>. If the liquids were possibly impure, everybody agrees that he may eat what certainly is heave. But here we deal with another Mishnah<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">166</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Zavim</i> 5:12.</i>. What is the reason of Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Simeon? Since according to both the impurity is certain, he needs immersion<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">167</sup><i class=\"footnote\">At the end, the contents of one of the vessels certainly was impure and made his body impure.</i>. What is the reason of Rebbi? That he should not be led into drinking a <i>reviït</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">168</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If he drinks less the immersion is not really necessary; it is a reminder not to make one’s body impure by drinking a <i>reviït</i> of a questionable liquid.</i>. According to the reason of Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Simeon, he drinks less than a <i>reviït</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">169</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In that case, no immersion at the end would be necessary. Hence, the argument is faulty because otherwise Rebbi and R. Eleazar would not quarrel, one speaking about a person drinking less than a <i>reviït</i>, the other about one who drinks more.</i>. Is Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Simeon not afraid that he would be led into drinking a <i>reviït</i>? Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, the only explanation you have is our first one. Rebbi is afraid that he drank the impure liquid first and Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Simeon is afraid that he drank the impure liquid at the end<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">170</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hence, the practical rule is the one given in the Tosephta.</i>."
