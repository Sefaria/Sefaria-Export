                "It is taught: caravans of [Jewish] people that were on a journey and met idol worshipers who said \"Give us one of your group so that we may kill him otherwise we will kill all of you!\" Even if the entire group of Jews will be killed it is forbidden to give up a single Jew to be killed. But if they demand a specific Jew by name, such as Sheva Ben Bichri they give that person up and are not killed. Says Rabbi Shimeon Ben Lakish: this only applies if the person specified had a death penalty upon him, like Sheva Ben Bichri. And Rabbi Yochanan [disagrees and] says even if he does not have the death penalty upon him [they give the specified individual up]. Ullah bar Koshev was wanted by the [Roman] Kingdom. He fled and went to Lod, to Rabbi Yehoshua Ben Levi's. They came and surrounded the city, and they said: if you don't give him to us, we will destroy de city.  Rabbi Yehoshua Ben Levi went to him [Ullah] and appeased him, and gave him [to the Roman authorities]. And Eliahu [Hanavi], may he be remembered for good, would teach him [RYBL] and reveal himself to him, and he did not reveal himself [anymore]. He fasted several fasts, and he [Eliahu] revealed himself. He said: \"And I reveal myself to informers?!\" He [RYBL] responded: \"And didn't I do [according to] a rabbinic teaching?\" And [Eliahu] answered: \"And is this a teaching for the pious?!\"",
                "Rabbi Imi was captured in a riot. Said Rabbi Yochanan: \"Should the dead man prepare his shrouds?\" Said Rabbi Shimeon Ben Lakish: \"Even if I am killed or I kill someone, I will go and I will save him with strength.\" He went and appeased them and brought him back. He said to them: Come to our elder and he will pray for you. They came to Rabbi Yochanan, who said to them: \"what was in your hearts to do to him, will be done to you.\" It happened to that same people: they had almost reached Palmyra and were all taken [captives]."
