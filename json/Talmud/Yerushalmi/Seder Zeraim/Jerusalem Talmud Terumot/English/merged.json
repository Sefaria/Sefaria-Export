Rebbi Yose says, before he came to the time of vows<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">105</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishnah <i>Niddah</i> 5:6: “The vows of a girl 11 years and one day of age are investigated (one inquires whether she understands the notion and severity of vows; if she does, her vows are valid.) If she is 12 years and one day old, her vows are <i>prima facie</i> valid but one investigates them during all of her thirteenth year. The vows of a boy 12 years and one day old are investigated; if he is 13 years and one day old, his vows are <i>prima facie</i> valid but one investigates them during all of his fourteenth year. Before that time, even if they say we know before Whom we made the vow and to Whom we dedicated a sacrifice, their vows are not vows and their dedications not dedications.” According to Rashi, “the time of vows” is when the vows are investigated; according to Maimonides [in his Code (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 11:3:2-6\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.11.3.2-6\"><i>Nedarim</i> 11:3</a>) and in the first and third versions of his Mishnah Commentary] it is the time when all vows are automatically valid. {Rashi’s opinion and the similar one of Maimonides in the second version of his Commentary are the only ones compatible with the Yerushalmi; Maimonides’s other opinion can be justified by the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Niddah 46b-47a\" href=\"/Niddah.46b-47a\">Babli, <i>Niddah</i> 46b–47a</a>.}</i>, his heave is not heave.

As we have stated there<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Mishnah Makhshirin 6:1\" href=\"/Mishnah_Makhshirin.6.1\">Mishnah <i>Makhširin</i> 6:1</a>: “If somebody brings his produce up to his roof because of worms and dew descended on it, it is not under the category of ‘when given’ but if he intended this {that the produce should be wetted by dew}, it is under the category of ‘when given’. If a deaf-mute, insane, or minor person brought them up, …”. As explained in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Demai 2:3:2\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.2.3.2\"><i>Demay</i>, Chapter 2, Note 141</a>, produce is not susceptible to impurity unless it came into contact with water (or any other fluid causing impurity, cf. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Demai 2:3:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.2.3.1\"><i>Demay</i>, Chapter 2, Note 136</a>) and that contact was desired, since the verse <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 11:38\" href=\"/Leviticus.11.38\"><i>Lev</i>. 11:38</a>: “If produce got wetted by water … it will be impure” can also be read as: “If water was given on produce …”. It is inferred that the wetting, even if happening by a passive process, must have an active ingredient, <i>viz</i>., that the moistening of the produce must be agreeable to the owner.</i>: “If a deaf-mute, insane, or minor person brought them up, they are not under the category of ‘when given’ because they have action but no intention.” What is their action? Rebbi Ḥuna said, when he grabs it while full of dew<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Chullin 13a\" href=\"/Chullin.13a\">Babli, <i>Ḥulin</i> 13a</a>, R. Joḥanan explains that he turns the produce over in order to distribute the moisture evenly. This is professional action. R. Simson conjectures that the action envisaged by R. Ḥuna is the same as explained by R. Joḥanan.</i>. We also have stated there<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Mishnah Makhshirin 3:8\" href=\"/Mishnah_Makhshirin.3.8\">Mishnah <i>Makhširin</i> 3:8</a>. It is explained in that Chapter that water drawn intentionally will make produce susceptible to impurity even if the contact of the produce with it was unintentional. The example described in Mishnah 8 is that of cattle whose feet have to be washed, either because the animal was used for threshing and now is all dusty, or because of some medical condition. Then the water drops clinging to the animal after it was washed in the river will make produce susceptible to impurity unless the animal was driven to the river by “a deaf-mute, insane, or minor person.” Here again, if the cattle are not only driven to the river but actively washed, intention is clearly shown.</i>: “If a deaf-mute, insane, or minor person brought them down, even if he thought that [his animals’] feet should be doused, it is not under the category of ‘when given’ because they have action but no intention.” What is their action? Rebbi Ḥuna said, when he rubs them with water. We should also say here, let their action be proof of their intentions! Rebbi Samuel, Rebbi Abbahu, in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan; Rebbi Zeïra in the name of the rabbis (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Numbers 18:27\" href=\"/Numbers.18.27\"><i>Num</i>. 18:27</a>): “Your heave will be credited to you.” When thought is mentioned in the verse<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The root both of “thought”, מחשבה, and “being accounted for”, נחשב, is חשב.</i>, his action cannot prove his intentions; when thought is not mentioned in the verse, his action can prove his intentions. Since here thought is mentioned in the verse, his action cannot prove his intentions.",
                "Rebbi Yose said, I questioned before Samuel: But with bills of divorce, thought is not written and his action cannot prove his intention! As we have stated<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 2:5:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.2.5.1\">Mishnah <i>Giṭṭin</i> 2:5</a>.</i>: “Everybody is permitted to write a bill of divorce, even an insane person, a deaf-mute, and a minor.” Rebbi Huna said, if a sane person directs him. Rebbi Joḥanan asked, is that (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Deuteronomy 24:1\" href=\"/Deuteronomy.24.1\"><i>Deut</i>. 24:1</a>,<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Deuteronomy 24:3\" href=\"/Deuteronomy.24.3\">3</a>): “he writes for her”, for her personally<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is an echo of the very short discussion in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 2:5:2\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.2.5.2\"><i>Giṭṭin</i> 2:5</a>. Rebbi Joḥanan points out that the divorce document must be written specifically for the woman in question. If two men with identical names are married to two women who have the same name, and both want to divorce them on the same day, the two divorce documents will have identical wording. Nevertheless, if the husbands switch the documents before they are handed to the respective wives, both divorces will be invalid. In both Talmudim, Samuel narrows down the meaning of the Mishnah in that he allows the incompetent only to write the formulaic portion under the direction of a competent person; but the data which make the document valid, date and names of the two persons involved, must be written by a competent person as agent of the husband. The argument here does not consider this restriction, except that R. Yose (Rav Assi of the first generation Amoraïm in Babylonia) is of the opinion that, since a document containing only date and names cannot be signed by witnesses and is not a divorce document, the writing of the incompetent is necessary for the validity of the document and one has to wonder why this is accepted.</i>? Rebbi Yose came back and said, there one person writes<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Writing a valid divorce document and using it for the divorce are two distinct actions; one may be valid without the other. But taking heave is valid only if the taking is intended for heave; the action itself needs thinking; this parallels the action of divorce, not the writing of part of the document.</i> and another person divorces. But here, the same person thinks and takes heave. Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa said, there, if he<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A competent person. Even if he writes all by himself there are two actions. This argument is valid only for R. Eleazar (ben Shamua, the Tanna) who holds that a divorce is validated by handing over the document before two witnesses. But according to R. Meїr who holds that a document is invalid if it has not been signed by two trustworthy witnesses, the writing of the document is not important, only the signing is, and this must be done by two competent persons unrelated to the husband.</i> would write himself and divorce, would that not be a divorce? But here, he thinks and takes heave.",
                "Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa, Rebbi Ḥiyya, in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: One disagrees with this Mishnah teacher<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He holds that incompetents may separate heave under the direction of a competent person.</i>. How is that? It turns out that Rebbi Joḥanan concerning heaves parallels Rebbi Ismael, the son of Rebbi Joḥanan ben Beroqa concerning sanctification, and Rebbi Joḥanan concerning divorces parallels the rabbis concerning sanctification, as we have stated<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Tosefta Parah 5:5\" href=\"/Tosefta_Parah.5.5\">Tosephta <i>Parah</i> 5:7</a> reads: “Everybody is able to sanctify except the deaf-mute, the insane, and the minor; but R. Jehudah approves of the minor. R. Ismael, the son of R. Joḥanan ben Beroqa says that the sanctifications of a deaf-mute person, an insane, and a minor, who sanctified in the presence of others, are valid. The sanctification by a sexless person is invalid, for he is possibly uncircumcised, and an uncircumcized person cannot sanctify. The sanctification by a hermaphrodite is valid but R. Jehudah declares it invalid since he possibly is a woman and a woman does not qualify for holy matters.”<br>All this refers to the purification from the impurity of the dead, which needs sprinkling with fresh water to which a minute amount of the ashes of the red heifer must be added. The act of taking the ashes and putting them into a vessel filled with fresh water is called “sanctification.” It is a sacral act (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Numbers 19:17\" href=\"/Numbers.19.17\"><i>Num</i>. 19:17</a>) and as such needs the intent of the person executing it. R. Ismael, the son of R. Joḥanan ben Beroqa, applies the principle that for obligations for which “thought” is implied by the verse but not spelled out explicitly, actions may prove intent.<br>{A sexless person is one without testicles or female sex characteristics. He might be a male with undescended testicles. The hermaphrodite has a penis and testicles as well as female breasts and a vagina; he must be circumcised. The exclusion of women by R. Jehudah is rejected by the rabbis; women nevertheless may not sprinkle since the verse (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 19:18\" href=\"/Leviticus.19.18\"><i>Lev</i>. 19:18</a>) requires this to be done by “a pure male.”}<br>The seeming inconsistency in the positions of R. Joḥanan is not resolved. {If one assumes that R. Joḥanan agrees with the position of Samuel (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Terumot 1:1:4\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Terumot.1.1.4\">Note 14</a>) there is no inconsistency since he will agree that the incompetent may write only the inconsequential parts of the divorce document.}</i>: “The sanctifications of a deaf-mute person, an insane, and a minor who sanctified are no sanctifications. Rebbi Ismael, the son of Rebbi Joḥanan ben Beroqa says, if they are alone, their sanctifications are no sanctifications. Together with others, their sanctifications are sanctifications.”",

A congenital deaf-mute cannot marry or divorce, while a hearing person who is mute is considered normal and can divorce by giving written directions, following Rabban Simeon and R. Mana. The only reason we require a triple confirmation of the will to divorce is to ascertain that the husband really wants the divorce, not that he wants to have a document ready should he want to divorce.</i>.

                "“ ‘You’ excludes one who gives heave from what is not his.” What is the interpretation, one who gives heave from what is not his own, or one who gives heave from what is somebody else’s? Let us hear the following: If he declared his heap as ownerless and then smoothed it and took possession again, if you refer to one who gives heave from what is not his own, his heave is not heave, if you refer to one who gives heave from what is somebody else’s, his heave is heave<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishnah <i>Ma‘serot</i> 1:6 states that tithes and heave are due after threshing, when the grain kernels have been assembled into a heap and the heap was smoothed. It is shown in <i>Ma‘serot</i>, Halakhah 1:1, that property which was ownerless at the moment when heave was due is exempt from heave. This seems to contradict the statement here that if a person declared his grain ownerless before it was smoothed, then gave heave, and only after that again took possession, his heave might be heave. The entire argument is possible only for R. Meïr, since R. Yose holds that property can be abandoned only if another person takes it up (cf. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Peah 6:1:6\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.6.1.6\"><i>Peah</i> 6:1, Note 17</a>).

As the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Nedarim 44b\" href=\"/Nedarim.44b\">Babli notes (<i>Nedarim</i> 44b</a>), any heave given from the repossessed grain must refer to the heap itself; it cannot possibly be given for unabandoned grain which is obligated by biblical decree (if we assume that heave is a biblical obligation after the Babylonian exile, cf. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Sheviit 7:1:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit.7.1.1\"><i>Ševi‘it</i> Chapter 7, Notes 11</a> ff.).</i>.

In Mishnah 3:10, R. Jehudah states that after presentation in the Temple, First Fruits may be given to any Cohen but the rabbis require that they be eaten by the priests serving in the Temple at the moment of presentation. This means that for R. Jehudah, the status of First Fruits is that of heave which may be eaten in the entire territory of the Holy Land (called “territorial consecrated things”) but for the rabbis they are consecrated to the Temple.</i>?

One may hold with Rebbi Simeon, since Rebbi Simeon says that tithes of animals teach you for all sacrifices about substitutions. That means, since he cannot bring tithes of grain he cannot bring tithes of animals; since he cannot bring tithes of animals he cannot make substitutions; since he cannot make substitutions for these he cannot make substitutions for any sacrifices.

If the minor’s dedication of an animal as sacrifice is valid in biblical law, it is sinful to slaughter the animal outside the Temple.

It is true that heave must be eaten by the Cohen in purity but normally immersion in a ritual bath is enough and sprinkling with purification water is not always necessary. All commentators, from the Gaonim to R. S. Lieberman, explain that “fence for the purification water” simply means that one tries to force the olive or wine grower to produce his oil and wine in ritual purity, for if one would permit giving heave from oil (wine) on oil olives (wine grapes), he either would make only a small amount in purity until he has given heave, or he would buy a small quantity of pure olives (grapes) from a fellow and pay the fellow to give heave in his name from his pure fluids. While this explanation seems pertinent, it does not explain the expression “fence for purification water”; it also contradicts the general tendency, clearly apparent in Tractate <i>Demay</i>, not to force the vulgar to conform to standards of observance he could not honestly sustain. But there seems no better explanation.</i>. What is more serious, robbing the tribe<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">137</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Cohen must himself turn the olives into oil, the grapes into wine, but the verse says that heave is given as (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Numbers 18:27\" href=\"/Numbers.18.27\"><i>Num</i>. 18:27</a>) “grain from the threshing floor and complete produce from the (oil or wine) press.”</i> or [breaching] the “fence” for purification water?

Anything in the Northern half of the heap now may be heave; therefore, the entire Northern half is <i>demaʻ</i>. The Sages draw a plane perpendicular to the base plane in North-South direction through the center and then two planes perpendicular to the base plane, making ±45° angles with the North-South plane, cutting the base plane in two lines forming a χ. The volume cut out by the Northern half of these planes is 1/4th of the entire volume.<br>It is more difficult to reconstruct the Talmud’s interpretation of the argument of Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel. If the idea is that in the base plane one draws a chord of the base circle so that it cuts off 1/8th of the area of the circular disk, let 2α be the angle of the circular sector subtended by the segment measured in radians and choose the radius of the circle as unit of measurement. Then the area of the segment is the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle from the center:<br><i>A</i> = α - sin α cos α = π/8<br>or α = .8832 rad = 50.63°. In that case, the height <i>h</i> of the segment is 1 - cos α = .365 of the radius of the base circle. However, if the idea is that the volume cut off from the cone by a plane, perpendicular to the base plane, through the chord, should be one eighth of the total volume then the problem is indeterminate since the ratio of radius of the circle to the height of the cone is not given. If this is assumed to be 1, the equation to be solved is<br>(α - sin α cos α)(1-cos α) = 3 π/8<br>or α = 1.4526 rad = 83.22°.

R. Meїr’s position is that we accept that heave taken in any permissible way retroactively turns its material into <i>ṭevel</i>, so that in any case only correct heave or tithes were taken (cf. <i>Demay</i> Chapter 5, Notes 45,63.).<br>Maimonides explains the Mishnah as stating that partial heave or tithes possibly remain <i>ṭevel</i> and therefore one must give heave or tithes from the separate produce.

Since Great Heave can be given only from earmarked produce, the natural thing to do is to use it for heave of the tithe which can be given from one place for another.

The remainder may then be worked in impurity. Since <i>ḥallah</i> follows the rules of heave, it must be taken from the dough itself. Ḥizqiah must follow R.

If there is damp fluid between them, even for heave all is impure.” According to Maimonides, the indentations are depressions in the bread that still contain fluid.

Simson, followed by R. Asher ben Ieḥiel, the baking sheet has depressions into which the dough is placed to obtain loaves of uniform size. The explanation of R.

The interpretation is rejected because it presupposes that pure and impure flour can be completely mixed, with a constant percentage of impure flour in the pure. Since presumably the two kinds are indistinguishable to the eye, mixing can not be assumed to be perfect. As a rough estimate, R. Joḥanan will admit R.

The Tanna of the Mishnah assumes that it is impossible that in all these processes only heave be lifted; even in the worst case some profane grain will be lifted. Therefore, he does not have to say “permitted as long as the volume of heave is less than that of profane grain.” The grain is permitted unless the amount of heave which fell in is larger than half the original amount of profane grain. This is the position of R. Simson and R. Abraham ben David.<br>Maimonides’s explanation is difficult to understand. He permits the mixture if at most 100 times 1 <i>seah</i> fell into the produce and was lifted. He gives no explanation. R. Joseph Caro explains that in the previous Mishnaiot, when the Sages assert that the heave counted in the remaining produce is computed proportionally, they assume that there was perfect mixing of heave and profane before the excess <i>seah</i> was lifted.

In the Babli, R.

But did we not state: “When has this been said? Regarding a vat which contains enough to lift it. But for a vat which does not contain enough to lift it, it is forbidden to make any amount impure.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">199</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the text both here and in <i>Pesaḥim</i> but it is difficult to explain.

If there is enough profane wine to let one lift heave according to the rules of Chapter 5, not much is lost since the wine remains usable. But if heave cannot be lifted because the profane is not more than 100 times the heave all becomes forbidden and, at most, can be used as ointment or to sprinkle on a dirt floor to eliminate dust.

In biblical law, pottery can become impure only from the inside; once the inside is impure by primary impurity, the outside also is impure. The outside of a pottery vessel can be impure only by rabbinic decree, not by biblical law. A metal vessel can become impure from the outside; such a vessel, if touched by a fluid from outside, becomes impure; cf. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 8:2:2\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.8.2.2\"><i>Berakhot</i>, Chapter 8, Note 46</a>.<br>Whether the discussion is about the position of R.

Rebbi Mana said, explain it if the vat is pure; the Mishnah deals with an impure vat<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">239</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Mishnah speaks of the “lower part of the winepress”. If that is a cistern built in the ground, it is part of the ground and cannot become impure. In that case, if the cistern is empty, the heave should be left to flow into it.

Olive oil <i>can</i> be used as fuel for lamps even if pure; it <i>must</i> be used as fuel once it becomes impure. It follows that suspended heave of oil is usable and the Amora R.
