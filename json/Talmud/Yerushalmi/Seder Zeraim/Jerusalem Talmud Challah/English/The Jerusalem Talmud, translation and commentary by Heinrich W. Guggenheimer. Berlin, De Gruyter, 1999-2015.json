Therefore, if one makes a new dough of exactly one <i>qab</i> which is made to “bite” the profane dough, one has a total of 5 quarters of obligation and may take only <i>ḥallah</i> of the obligated, not from the already exempt. This means in general that if the amount of sour dough is <i>x</i>, the amount needed to avoid giving <i>ḥallah</i> for everything is (5 quarters - <i>x</i>). In this way, neither does one take <i>ḥallah</i> from another place nor does one have to take <i>ḥallah</i> for everything.</i>: Otherwise, he brings four quarters and makes it bite.
