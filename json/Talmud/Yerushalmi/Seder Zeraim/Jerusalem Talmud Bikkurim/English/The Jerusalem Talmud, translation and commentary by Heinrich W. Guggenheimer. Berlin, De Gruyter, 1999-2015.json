According to R. Jehudah, only the declaration in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Deuteronomy 26:3\" href=\"/Deuteronomy.26.3\"><i>Deut</i>. 26:3</a> is made with the basket on the farmer’s shoulder.

Jehudah. <i>Sifry</i> <i>Deut</i>. #300 infers from 26:4, “you shall put it down before the altar of the Eternal, your God”, that in the absence of an altar there cannot be any obligation of First Fruits. In #301 it is inferred from the double mention of “putting down” that there are two, one for the declaration and one for the subsequent prostration.<br>The late <i>Targum Yerushalmi</i> (Pseudo Jonathan) translates 26:4: “The Cohen shall take the basket from your hand, <i>move it forward and backward, upward</i> <i>and downward</i>, and <i>at the end</i> put it down before the altar of the Eternal, your God.” The first inserted text describes the “weaving” required by R.

The language of the Babli is straightforward: For something which may become permitted without invoking the rules of insignificance (1 in 60, 100, or 200), those rules were not instituted. The standard example is that of an egg freshly laid on the Sabbath which is not food prepared for the Sabbath but becomes automatically permitted at the end of the Sabbath. If such an egg disappears in a barrel containing 1’000 eggs, all are forbidden for use until the end of the Sabbath.<br>The language of the Yerushalmi, “something which has no possibility to become permitted”, presupposes the knowledge of the rule: If the rules of insignificance were not instituted for a certain case, they are not applicable even in the case of the smallest possible admixture. Since First Fruits and second tithe can be eaten in Jerusalem, they are always permitted for authorized people and are therefore “something which has no possibility to become permitted”.</i>.

This means that if the ox has been condemned in court to be stoned but the owners slaughtered it before execution, the meat is still forbidden. What does mean: “The owner of the ox is free”? Ben Azai said, he is freed from his property; the entire animal is forbidden for all usufruct. On that, R. Joshua ben Levi adds that not only the meat but (hide and) horns are forbidden even if it died before slaughter. R. Joḥanan objects and notes that if the verse deals with two cases (stoned or slaughtered), the rules have to apply to both. In the case of R. Joshua ben Levi this means that the verse is needed to forbid hide and horns also for a correctly slaughtered ox; therefore, one does not understand why he did not object to R. Yannai that both second tithe and First Fruits should have the same rules.</i>, Rebbi Joshua ben Levi said, it was quoted for the horns of a cadaver.
