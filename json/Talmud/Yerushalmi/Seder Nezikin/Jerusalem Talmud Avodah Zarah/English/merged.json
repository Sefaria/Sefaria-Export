The assertion of the book of Kings that there was a perpetual state of war between the Northern and the Southern kingdoms in the time of Jeroboam (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"I Kings 15:6\" href=\"/I_Kings.15.6\"><i>1K</i>. 15:6</a>) is interpreted as a war of words conducted in the House of Study.<br>Another tradition (mentioned frequently but not undisputed) holds that nobody is allowed to sit in the Temple but a Davidic king (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Pesachim 5:10:2-4\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Pesachim.5.10.2-4\"><i>Pesaḥim</i>5:10</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Yoma 3:2:2-7\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yoma.3.2.2-7\"><i>Yoma</i>3:2</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Sotah 7:7:2-3\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sotah.7.7.2-3\"><i>Soṭah</i>7:7</a>; <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Sanhedrin 101b\" href=\"/Sanhedrin.101b\">Babli <i>Sanhedrin</i>101b</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Sotah 40a\" href=\"/Sotah.40a\"><i>Soṭah</i>40a</a>,<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Sotah 41a\" href=\"/Sotah.41a\">41a</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Yoma 25a\" href=\"/Yoma.25a\"><i>Yoma</i>25a</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Kiddushin 78a\" href=\"/Kiddushin.78a\"><i>Qiddušin</i>78a</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Tamid 27a\" href=\"/Tamid.27a\"><i>Tamid</i>27a</a>).

In <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Mishnah Parah 2:1\" href=\"/Mishnah_Parah.2.1\">Mishnah <i>Parah</i>2:1</a>, a first statement of R. Eliezer validates a pregnant Red Cow for the ceremonies; the reason is explained in Mishnah 4 by his student’s R. Illai’s son R. Jehudah, that a bull mounting the Cow on his own cannot be considered making her carrying anything; only copulation by human intervention makes the ox the equivalent of a yoke. The majority rejects the ruling; it considers the Cow and its fetus as two separate beings but v. 19:3 requires the Cow alone to be taken. These restrictions do not apply to ordinary sacrifices. R. Eliezer then forbids buying a Red Cow from Gentiles since a sodomized animal is unfit for the altar; the Sages disagree since without reason one does not suspect that such a thing happened; this would make the Mishnah here unreasonable.

Since the Song of Songs clearly celebrates heterosexual love, the speaker must be a female addressing a male.<br>The following interpretation of the Mishnah follows S. Naeh [שלמה נאה, טובים דודיך מיין, מבט חדש על משנת ע״ז ב:ה; מחקרים בתלמוד ובמדרש, ספר זכרון לתירצה ליפשיץ, י-ם 2005 ע' 434-411.]. There are two problems. What is the relationship of the Mishnah 7 and the first part of Mishnah 8 to the second part of Mishnah 8? Also the discussion in Mishnah 8 does not seem to make sense. Since <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Song of Songs 1:2\" href=\"/Song_of_Songs.1.2\"><i>Cant</i>. 1:2</a> starts: <i>May he kiss me with kisses of his mouth</i>, it should be clear that the speaker is the female. Why should R. Ismael, who everywhere else requires that a verse be interpreted according to its plain sense, suddenly switch speakers in middle sentence? Why does R. Joshua refer to 1:3, when a referral to 1:2 would be more appropriate? The unvocalized text of 1:2–3 has a chiastic structure: It starts clearly with the masculine, has a middle section which could be read in the masculine or the feminine, and ends again with the masculine.<br>R. Ismael proves convincingly that there is no biblical basis for the prohibition of Gentile cheese; it is purely rabbinical. It can be regarded as a “fence around the law” only with regard to the prohibition of intermarriage, since it is designed to make social intercourse between Jews and Gentiles as difficult as possible. Then the question arises as to the status of the much more important prohibitions oil and wine. The prohibition of oil clearly is rabbinical even though it is mentioned as particularly meritorious in <i>Daniel</i>; no reason could be found in dietary laws to prohibit Gentile cold pressed virgin olive oil. While wine actually used for pagan libations is biblically forbidden, the extension of the prohibition to almost any wine moved in any way by a Gentile, even one adhering to a faith not practicing libations (or even prohibiting the drinking of wine), must be considered rabbinical. Now wine in mentioned in v. 1:2 and oil in v. 1:3. The discussion between Rabbis Ismael and Joshua is about the status of the prohibitions of wine and oil.<br>As mentioned in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Avodah Zarah 2:7:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Avodah_Zarah.2.7.1\">Note 306</a>, any rabbinic reference to the Song of Songs unquestionably reads sentences put into the mouth of the female as coming from the congregation of Israel (as represented by its rabbinical leaders) and that of the male as referring to God. R. Joshua asks R. Ismael about his opinion about the actual rules referring to Gentile wine. The latter, by putting the reference to wine in the mouth of the male, asserts that the prohibition of Gentile wine essentially is God’s decree, is biblical. R. Joshua, the overriding authority, informs him that the references to wine and oil have equal status; since the prohibition of oil in almost all cases has no pentateuchal basis, the prohibition of wine also in almost all cases is purely rabbinical (Cf. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Avodah Zarah 5:4:6\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Avodah_Zarah.5.4.6\">Halakhah 5:4, Note 67</a>).</i>.",

If a cow is known to suffer from a defect which makes it “torn”, its milk is forbidden as drink but as stomach contents it becomes excrement and is no longer forbidden.

According to the Babli and one opinion in the Yerushalmi the prohibition applies only to eggs laid by chickens raised to produce eggs. Then the mother was not food at the start of the holiday. While the egg is food according to everybody, for the House of Hillel it cannot change its character from non-food to food on the holiday. Then the question is raised why milk which is prohibited as food before being ingested by a ruminant becomes permitted by the animal’s stomach. In this question, the revised ruling in matters of rennet would agree with the stance of the House of Shammai.

Rebbi Zeriqa in the name of Rebbi Ḥanina<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">180</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In, <i>Šabbat</i>: Rav Jehudah. On one hand, the tradent in <i>Šabbat</i> is mentioned as R. Zeriqan, the Yerushalmi form, not the Babli form Zeriqa as here; but this is to be explained by the babylonized spelling of the text of the present Tractate. On the other hand, the tradent in the Babli (<i>Šabbat</i> 82b) is R. Eleazar, a known student of R. Ḥanina.</i>, but some say in the name of Rav Ḥisda: Rebbi Aqiba agrees with the Sages that idolatry does not impart impurity through a cover stone. But the rabbis say it was compared to <i>abominations</i> of vermin. As vermin imparts impurity by motion<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">181</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here one has a serious discrepancy between the technical terminology of the Babli and the Yerushalmi. In the Babli impurity by motion is a form of impurity by load: If a person suffering from a genital discharge moves something indirectly or is moved with it, he imparts impurity. In the Yerushalmi this is consistently designated by its Mishnaic name, מִדְרָס, “stepping on.” This kind of impurity emphatically does not exist for vermin, or anything other than genital discharges. Therefore היסט the “motion” mentioned here must be that of a person’s hand touching an impure object. Transfer of impurity by touch is the only one mentioned for the eight kinds of impure vermin.</i>, so also idolatry imparts impurity by motion.

How could one decree severe impurity which can be easily eliminated? On this Rav says that even a house not built for worship becomes permanently forbidden as if it had been built as a pagan temple, if itself was worshipped. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Avodah Zarah 47b\" href=\"/Avodah_Zarah.47b\">Babli 47b</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Meilah 20a\" href=\"/Meilah.20a\"><i>Meˋilah</i> 20a</a>.</i>.

Just as real estate cannot become forbidden by idolatry, larceny by improper use of dedicated objects does not apply to real estate. If a house is considered real estate, it cannot become forbidden by worship, and its improper use while in the possession of the Temple cannot trigger a fine for larceny. If it is not considered real estate since the building materials were movables before being used, it can become forbidden and improper use can trigger the fine.</i>?

Grapes harvested for wine making are placed in a vat for transport to the wine press. The fluid oozing out of injured grape berries are collected in the vat and also used for making wine. This fluid is welcome; therefore it prepares the grapes for impurity as explained in <i>Demay</i>2:3 Notes 136,137, 141. An observant Jew harvesting together with an unobservant one is guilty of helping to cause impurity to fruits of the Land. There really is no intrinsic reason to forbid pressing the grapes which already are impure; the prohibition to help in pressing is a general rule “not to support sinners”.</i> one neither stamps nor harvests with him but one transports with him amphoras to the wine press and brings with him from the wine press<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">133</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Transporting empty amphoras to the wine press is not connected with any impropriety; it is not even forbidden to fill impure wine into pure amphoras which thereby will become impure.

What is the reason of Rebbi Yose? They were pure by biblical standards. You are the one who decided that they be impure<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">140</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is R. Jonah’s argument. There is no biblical impurity for Gentiles; the laws of impurity are uniquely formulated for Jews.

By all standards a person is not only permitted but obligated to free his <i>ṭevel</i> by separating the heave. The text in <i>Ḥallah</i> correctly reads: “a person may make his <i>ṭevel</i> impure by biblical standards.” The main point of the argument is given there but omitted here. Heave not only must be consumed in purity but it is stated in Num. 18:8 that the priests have a special duty to guard heave from impurity. It follows that this duty does not apply to <i>ṭevel</i>, which therefore may be allowed to become impure; disagreeing with the hypothesis underlying the Mishnah.<br> The quote here refers to a different subject. Heave given to Aaron in his quality of priest is pure heave for which he can exercise his duty to watch it and consume it in purity. But once produce has incurred even a doubt of impurity it can no longer be consumed by the Cohen; this eliminates not only the duty of guarding it but all rules made to safeguard it. If the rules of purity no longer can be observed there remain no restrictions on harvesting and pressing grapes with a Gentile.</i> his <i>ṭevel</i> as it is written, <i>you should give from it the Eternal’s heave to Aaron the priest</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">143</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Numbers 18:27\" href=\"/Numbers.18.27\"><i>Num</i>. 18:27</a>.</i>.

Everybody agrees that if the ox was correctly slaughtered before a trial could be held the meat is kosher. The Babli has to find the prohibition of usufruct in another part of the verse which makes the prohibition one of rabbinic interpretation rather than biblical.<br>Louis Ginzberg in his <i>Yerushalmi Fragments from the Genizah</i> (New York 1909) p. 280 has published a leaf of selections from the entire tractate.
