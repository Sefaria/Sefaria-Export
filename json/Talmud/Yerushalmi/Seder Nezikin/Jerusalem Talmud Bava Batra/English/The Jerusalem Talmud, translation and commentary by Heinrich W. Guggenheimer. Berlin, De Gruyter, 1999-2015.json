If anybody does not want to participate in an <i>‘eruv</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A major bone of contention between Sadducees and Pharisees in Second Temple times was the interpretation of <i>Ex.</i> 19:26: “Nobody shall leave his place on the Sabbath day.” It is agreed that this implies that one may carry things at will at “one’s place”, i. e., in one’s house, and that one may not carry in the public domain. As a matter of principle, it is agreed that a condominium space, such as a courtyard, does not qualify as “one’s place.” In pharisaic interpretation, this is only a rabbinic interpretation; it is not biblical. As a consequence, there is a rabbinic possibility to turn the courtyard into a common space by collecting contributions to symbolically prepare food for a common meal of all dwellers around the courtyard and depositing it in one of the houses. This is called <i>“ ‘eruv</i> (mixing) of courtyards”. The whole idea of <i>‘eruv</i> is rejected by Sadducees who consider reliance on it as a breach of the biblical Sabbath prohibition. It is similarly possible to turn a dead-end alley into a common courtyard of all dwellers there by affixing either a vertical lath or an horizontal beam at the entrance to the alley and then treating the alley and all courtyards which open into it as one large courtyard where then carrying is permitted. But if even one dweller in a courtyard or a dead end alley rejects the entire idea of <i>‘eruv,</i> no <i>‘eruv</i> can be made. The presence of Gentiles is irrelevant for purposes of making an <i>‘eruv.</i></i> one enters his house and makes the <i>‘eruv</i> against his will. But was it not stated: if he does not want to make an <i>‘eruv,</i> if he does not refuse one enters his house and makes the <i>‘eruv</i> against his will? Because he does not refuse.

Ḥiyya seems to ask a similar question relative to agricultural property. חוּליה means “ring”, from the root חלל, חול “to describe a circle”, but it is not clear that חליה is the same as חוליה.The translation in the text follows R. Eliahu Fulda, not to leave the sentence untranslated. He reads חליות מחולקות as “half circles” formed by pliable twigs, such as willow branches, with both ends planted on the ground to support branches of fruit trees heavy with fruit. He also derives the <i>hapax</i> ברות from ברר “to select”. [Starting with the Constantinople edition (1622), all printed editions read לכרות “to cut off”, which replaces an unknown word by one well-known but devoid of sense in the context.] But one could as well read ברות as Arabic بُرَاة “hunter’s hut” and refer the question to the watchman’s hut and ask about the status of such a hut built with split rings formed of any material. One also could read חַלִּיּוֹת מְחוּלָּקוֹת לְבָרוֹת “chopped herbs (خَلٌى) for healing”, whether these have the status of cut grain.
