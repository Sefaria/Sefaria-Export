                "How do witnesses become liable [to receive a punishment] as perjurers?[If they say:] “We testify that so and so [a priest] is a son of a woman who had [formerly] been divorced or a halutzah,” it is not said that each witness should himself be as if he was born of a divorcee or a halutzah; instead he receives forty [lashes]. [If they say]: “We testify that so and so is guilty of [a crime entailing] exile”, it is not said that each witness should himself be exiled; rather he receives forty [lashes]. [If they say:] “We testify that so and so divorced his wife and has not paid her ketubah” seeing that either today or tomorrow he [the husband] will pay her ketubah, the assessment should be made how much a man will be willing to pay [now] for the ownership of her ketubah, on the condition that if she should be widowed or divorced [he will take it over] but if she should die, her husband will inherit her [estate including the ketubah]."
