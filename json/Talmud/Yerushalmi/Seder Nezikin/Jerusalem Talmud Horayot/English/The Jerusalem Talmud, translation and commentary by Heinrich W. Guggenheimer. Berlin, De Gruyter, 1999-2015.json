While the distance by which the parcel is moved is irrelevant in practice since only the fact counts that it is transported across the border line between public and private domains, a ruling that a minimum distance be required for the transfer to be a violation of Sabbath law is thinkable.</i>.

Since <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"I Kings 19:18\" href=\"/I_Kings.19.18\"><i>1K.</i>19:18</a> shows that going down on one’s knees is forbidden worship, it is possible to imagine a ruling that going down onone’s knees is prosecutable but other forms of prostration are not.</i>. Would you not have eliminated the entire notion of taking out? Rebbi Samuel ben Rav Isaac said, if they said, one dried fig is permitted but two dried figs are forbidden<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">109</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This refers to the prohibitions of the Sabbath. While the prohibition of moving things from one place to another is only one of the 49 categories of forbidden actions, its rules in effect cover half of Tractate <i>Šabbat</i> and all of Tractate ˋ<i>Eruvin.</i> Moving minute quantities from domain to domain is not punishable. For example, transporting vegetable seeds in a volume less that of a dried fig is not punishable (Mishnah <i>Šabbat</i> 9:7). The long list of minimal quantities is traditional, not biblical. A wrong ruling in these matters does not abolish the principle that some minimal quantity is defined for everything.</i>. This follows him who said that bringing in and taking out are the same<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">110</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Everybody agrees that “transporting” for the rules of the Sabbath comprises taking up, moving, and putting down. There is a discussion at the start of Tractate <i>Šabbat</i> (1:1, 2b l.11 ff.) whether the inclusion of putting down is scriptural or is a matter of indirect inference. If one accepts that “taking up” implies “putting down”, then the formulation of the Mishnah covers rulings both about taking up and putting down; but if the biblical status of “putting down” is different from “taking up”, the latter should have been mentioned. An answer is unnecessary since the consensus is that “taking up” implies “putting down”.</i>. But for him who said that bringing in and taking out are two notions, would you not have eliminated the entire notion of bringing in?

All other fat is permitted (שׁוּמָן). The exact definition of each category is a matter of rabbinic tradition and as such within the purview of the Court.</i>.

The rabbis of Caesarea say, instead of comparing it to kinds of fat, why not compare it to [the laws of] Sabbath<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This remark does not fit in here; it shows that the text was taken from <i>Šabbat</i> 1:1 (2b line 32 ff.) where R. Yose’s (the Amora’s) remark here is put in the mouth of R. Yudan (the Amora) to explain the opinion of R. Yose (the Tanna) about violations of Sabbath prohibitions. It is forbidden to transport goods from one place to another on the Sabbath. “Transporting” means taking up the goods, moving them from one domain to another, and unloading. If any of the three actions be missing, no prosecutable sin was committed. In addition, for each kind of goods the Mishnah specifies minimal amounts. If less than the amount specified was transported while the person was oblivious of the Sabbath, no purification offering is required. On the other hand, if any number of transports were executed within one period of oblivion, only one sacrifice is needed. R. Yose the Tanna then specifies that repeated transports of less than a minimal amount add up to an atonable sin only if the different pieces were transported between the same domains [<i>Šabbat</i> 1:1 (2b line 22), <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Shabbat 80a\" href=\"/Shabbat.80a\">Babli <i>Šabbat</i> 80a</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Bava Batra 55b\" href=\"/Bava_Batra.55b\"><i>Bava batra</i> 55b</a>, <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Keritot 17a\" href=\"/Keritot.17a\"><i>Keritut</i> 17a</a>.] This is compared to the rules specifying purification sacrifices for eating pieces of forbidden fat. The rabbis of Caesarea object that there is no proof that the rules of the Sabbath be identical to the rules for other biblical prohibitions, but the rules detailed for transporting are paralleled by rules for other kinds of activities on the Sabbath. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Shabbat 13:1:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shabbat.13.1.1\">Mishnah <i>Šabbat</i> 13:1</a> states that weaving is forbidden and the threshold for an action requiring a purification sacrifice is weaving two threads. For the majority, weaving two threads in one oblivion triggers the obligation of a sacrifice, for R. Yose only if the two rows were added to the same piece of cloth.</i>? If he wove a single thread for one cloth and a single thread for another cloth, is that anything? If he wove several threads for several pieces of cloth in one oblivion, he is liable only for one [sacrifice]. Was there not an obligation for a sacrifice in the meantime, and you say that they are counted together<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Now one returns to the problem posed in the preceding paragraph, of the person who ate three half-olive sized pieces of forbidden fat while he was in different states for possible purification sacrifices. Is it possible to decide between R. Joḥanan on one side and R. Yose (the Amora) and the colleagues on the other? For the latter, it should make sense to combine the two pieces eaten while the person was a commoner. This is rejected, since the two states of commoner are separated by an interval in which the purification offering had to be different, everybody will agree that the three half sized pieces do not add up to one full sized piece.</i>?

He took the fist full and afterwards burned it; he received and afterwards threw it, he burned and afterwards sprinkled?

But <i>Lev</i>. <i>Rabba</i>, an old text, shows that the case of slave and master is not a legal but a homiletic statement. There the argument is that the High Priest is the servant of the people; the Sanctuary is run only on behalf of the people.
