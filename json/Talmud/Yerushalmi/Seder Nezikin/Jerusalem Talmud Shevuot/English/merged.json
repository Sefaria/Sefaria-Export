                "<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> There are two kinds of oaths which are four kinds<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 5:4\" href=\"/Leviticus.5.4\"><i>Lev</i>. 5:4</a> requires a reparation sacrifice for inadvertent breach of a commitment made by oath, “what was pronounced, negatively or positively.” The standard example of a positive oath is somebody swearing that he will eat certain foods. The corresponding negative is an oath that he will refrain from eating certain foods. The exact expression used, לְהָרַ֣ע ׀ א֣וֹ לְהֵיטִ֗יב, by its <i>hiph`il</i> form points to the future. A natural complement are backward looking oaths, if a person swears that he ate or did not eat certain foods in the past (Mishnah 3:1). These four cases are equal in sanctions for willful or inadvertent breach.</i>. There are two kinds of awareness of impurity which are four kinds<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 5:2-3\" href=\"/Leviticus.5.2-3\"><i>Lev</i>. 5:2–3</a> requires a reparation sacrifice for a person who became impure, forgot it, and then either ate <i>sancta</i> in his impurity or entered the Sanctuary. The two added cases are that he knew about being impure but forgot that the food was holy or that the place was a Sanctuary.</i>. There are two kinds of export on the Sabbath which are four kinds<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is forbidden to transport anything on the Sabbath from a private domain to the public domain (Mishnah <i>Šabbat</i> 1:1). “Transport” includes lifting up, moving, and setting down. The two cases where one is liable (for a sacrifice if the sin was unintentional, punishment if the transgression was intentional, and is prosecutable, or extirpation by Divine decree if the crime was intentional but is not prosecutable) are “export” by a person standing inside the private domain, lifting something up inside the domain and putting it down on the outside (e. g., through a window) even without moving his feet, or “import”, somebody lifting an object from the outside to the inside and depositing it there. The two cases where one is not liable refer to a person inside who lifts an object, hands it to a person outside (so that the object never is at rest) and the second person puts it down. Since no one person completed a criminal act, no one can be held liable even though the combined action clearly is forbidden.</i>. There are two kinds of appearances of skin disease which are four kinds<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 13:2\" href=\"/Leviticus.13.2\"><i>Lev</i>. 13:2</a> defines impure skin disease as שְׂאֵ֤ת אֽוֹ־סַפַּ֨חַת֙ א֣וֹ בַהֶ֔רֶת “as elevated spot, or <i>sapaḥat</i>, or a white spot.” This is read as “an elevated spot (which makes the surrounding skin look elevated over the whitish spot) and a really white spot and their appendages”, deriving <i>sapaḥat</i> from the root ספח, “to append, adjoin.” This extends the definition of impure skin disease from two relatively well defined cases to two additional weaker symptoms.</i>.",
                "<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “There are two kinds of oaths which are four kinds,” etc. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This paragraph is a slightly garbled copy of the first paragraph in Tractate <i>Šabbat</i> 1:1, of which there exists a Genizah parallel (L. Ginzberg, <i>Yerushalmi Fragments from the Genizah</i>, New York 1909, p. 62). The text in <i>Šabbat</i> is original since in both versions, “here” refers to <i>Šabbat</i> while “there” refers to <i>Ševuot</i>, and in addition, the statement of R. Ba logically has to precede that of R. Yose as in the <i>Šabbat</i> text. Probably the scribe of the <i>Ševuot</i> text available to the Leiden ms.’s scribe had omitted the statement of R. Ba and added it in the text when he noticed the omission. S. Liebermann, in his Commentary to the Yerushalmi <i>Šabbat</i> (<i>Hayerushalmi Kipshuto</i>, New York 1995, Jerusalem 1935) holds that the source is <i>Ševuot</i>. This is difficult to accept; the text is from <i>Šabbat</i> but the problem is the discrepancy in meaning of the same expression “two which are four” used in very different meanings in our Mishnah.<br>The problem starts with the rather complicated language of Mishnah <i>Šabbat</i> 1:1: “There are two cases which are four for exporting and two cases which are four for importing.” The Mishnah then goes on to explain that if a rich person, the owner, stands at the window of a house (which is a private domain) and a poor person stands in the street (the public domain), if then the rich person delivers an object to the poor outside, or the poor reaches inside and takes the object, the person acting is liable to prosecution but the other is not liable. (In fact, the passive participant never did do anything; the expression “not liable to prosecution” is inappropriate.) But if the rich person lifted the object, kept it moving all the time, and handed it to the poor who put it down, nobody is liable since nobody completed a forbidden act. The same naturally applies if the poor takes up a package and keeps it moving until the the owner of the house takes it and puts it down. In this case, the qualification as “not liable” is appropriate since both participants violated a Sabbath prohibition.<br>The question now arises whether the formulation “two which are four” always implies that the status of the two additional cases is different from the two original ones since in our Mishnah the same expression is used for oaths and Sabbath violations.</i> Two which are four for liability and two which are four for no liability, or four for liability and four for no liability<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">S. Liebermann (Note 5) proposes to delete “four which are not liable” as induced by the preceding statement about “two and two” even though the text is common to all three versions at our disposal and it is difficult to assume that the redundant text was taught in the Galilean Academy. For the rules of the Sabbath, the case is simple and there is no redundancy. In the formulation of Mishnah <i>Šabbat</i> 1:1 there are four cases of liability, rich or poor taking out or rich or poor bringing in. There are also four cases where there is no liability, depending on who takes up the object first and who takes over, and what the direction of the move is. The question now is raised whether a similar case can be made for the first clause in Mishnah <i>Ševuot</i> 1:1.</i>? Let us hear from the following: “There are two kinds of oaths which are four kinds,” etc.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The statement of R. Abba later in this paragraph should be inserted here as noted in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Shevuot 1:1:2\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shevuot.1.1.2\">Note 5</a>. While “here” in <i>Šabbat</i> the Mishnah itself explains that there are two cases of liability and two of no liability, the situation in <i>Ševuot</i> is different; all four cases trigger the obligation of a sacrifice for inadvertent infraction and punishment for intentional infraction in the presence of witnesses.</i> Rebbi Yose said, the Mishnah says so, “there are two kinds of oaths which are four kinds,” not because of liability<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rebbi Yose disagrees with R. Abba. Since everybody agrees that there are four cases which trigger a liability for oaths, the fact that the statement about Sabbath is formulated in the same Mishnah and in parallel form implies the same meaning in both clauses. Since Note 7 shows that Mishnah <i>Šabbat</i> 1:1 enumerates four cases of liability, there is no obstacle to reading the Sabbath clause in parallel to the oath clause. It is shown later in the paragraph that there are explicit verses only to forbid export; the parallel prohibitions of import are rabbinic interpretations.</i>? And similarly, “there are two kinds of export on the Sabbath which are four kinds,” because there is liability<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rebbi Yose disagrees with R. Abba. Since everybody agrees that there are four cases which trigger a liability for oaths, the fact that the statement about Sabbath is formulated in the same Mishnah and in parallel form implies the same meaning in both clauses. Since Note 7 shows that Mishnah <i>Šabbat</i> 1:1 enumerates four cases of liability, there is no obstacle to reading the Sabbath clause in parallel to the oath clause. It is shown later in the paragraph that there are explicit verses only to forbid export; the parallel prohibitions of import are rabbinic interpretations.</i>. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The statement of R. Abba later in this paragraph should be inserted here as noted in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Shevuot 1:1:2\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shevuot.1.1.2\">Note 5</a>. While “here” in <i>Šabbat</i> the Mishnah itself explains that there are two cases of liability and two of no liability, the situation in <i>Ševuot</i> is different; all four cases trigger the obligation of a sacrifice for inadvertent infraction and punishment for intentional infraction in the presence of witnesses.</i> Rebbi Abba said, there all are about liability, but here we come to state both liability and no liability. This implies four of liability and four of no liability. But did we not state, the doors of the Temple hall were two which are four<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This <i>baraita</i> refers to <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Mishnah Middot 4:1\" href=\"/Mishnah_Middot.4.1\">Mishnah <i>Middot</i> 4:1</a> which explains that the entrance gate to the Temple hall was built in the manner of a city gate, a thick wall closed by an outer double door opening to the outside and an inner two-winged door opening to the inside. The expression “two doors which are four” is simply the description of the structure of the building.</i>? Can you say, liability and no liability<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is inappropriate here.</i>? Should we state twelve cases of no liability<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishnah <i>Šabbat</i> 1:1 counts four actions for which one is liable (complete actions, export and import for the rich person, export and import for the poor.) Then it counts four cases for which one is not liable, but since for any incomplete action one is not liable one could consider the possibility that the poor man reaches into the house, lifts the object which the rich then takes up and deposits on the outside. A similar convoluted action is possible for import; two actions for two actors each result in four non-liabilities.</i>? We come to state cases of no liability which correspond to cases of no liability<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Only those cases are counted where a direct action, resulting in liability if executed by one person, imply no liability if done by two. The convoluted cases of <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Shevuot 1:1:2\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shevuot.1.1.2\">Note 11</a> are not noted since they do not correspond to a case that could involve only one actor.</i>. Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Ada<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Šabbat</i>: bar Abba. In the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Shabbat 2b-3a\" href=\"/Shabbat.2b-3a\">Babli, <i>Šabbat</i> 2b/3a</a>, the argument is by Babylonian Amoraim.</i> said, what is this “no liability” which we stated here? Permitted<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The expression “no liability” is used in Mishnah <i>Šabbat</i> 1:1 in two completely different senses. As noted earlier (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Shevuot 1:1:2\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shevuot.1.1.2\">Note 5</a>) if the complete action is performed by one person, the other one is passive and does not infringe on any law; at all times everything he does is permitted. But if the action is completed by two persons, both sinned. While they are not liable for a sacrifice or punishment, they require repentance and Heaven’s forgiveness.</i>! Rebbi Yose said, the poor man and the rich man are one but the Sages counted them as two. Exporting or importing are two but the Sages counted them as one<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since both the rich man and the poor are described as executing the same actions, there is no intrinsic reason why they should be considered separately. It only is to emphasize the importance of the rules of transporting on the Sabbath. But, as will be shown in the sequel, not to bring out is a direct biblical command while not bringing into a private domain from the public one is an inference; the rules of importing must be transferred from those of exporting.<br>In <i>Šabbat</i>, the Genizah text and the first hand of the Leiden ms. read “Exporting or importing are one but the Sages counted them as two” but as S. Liebermann (Note 5) has noted, the reading here is supported by early Medieval quotes.</i>. Exporting on the Sabbath does not include importing; if one exports from a domain this does not include importing<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since there are no verses spelling out the prohibition of carrying from the public domain to a private one.</i>. If one who exports from one domain to the other, does this not include the one who imports<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Importing into one domain is exporting from another. There seems to be no reason to make a distinction between domains (even though there is a big difference since in a private domain one may carry without restriction but in the public domain only for a distance of less than 4 cubits.)</i>? In addition, from what Rebbi Yasa said in the name if Rebbi Joḥanan: Somebody who imports half the size of a dried fig and exports half the size of a dried fig is liable<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">While any transport from one domain to another on the Sabbath is sinful, it creates a liability only if the object is of a minimal size (<i>Šabbat</i> Chapters 7–8). For solid food, the minimum is fixed at the volume of a dried fig. The two actions mentioned will combine if there was continuous awareness of the Sabbath prohibitions.</i>. And from where that exporting is called work? Rebbi Samuel in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: “Moses ordered, they made a public proclamation in the camp,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 36:6\" href=\"/Exodus.36.6\"><i>Ex</i>. 36:6</a>. The verse speaks of donations for the construction of the Tabernacle. The <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Shabbat 96b\" href=\"/Shabbat.96b\">Babli (<i>Šabbat</i> 96b</a>) finds a tenuous connection with the Sabbath by a <i>gezerah šawah</i>, concurrent use of words.</i>” etc. The people refrained from taking objects out from their houses to give them to the collectors, who also did not take out anything from them to import into the office. Rebbi Ḥizqiah in the name of Rebbi Aḥa understood it from the following: “do not bring out any load from your houses on the Sabbath day, and perform no work.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jeremiah 17:22\" href=\"/Jeremiah.17.22\"><i>Jer</i>. 17:22</a>. While prophetic books are not sources of law, they are authentic evidence for the understanding of the Torah by the teachers of past generations. It is proved that in the understanding of Jeremiah (whose student Barukh ben Neriah is credited with bringing the study of Torah to Babylonia) moving objects from a private to the public domain is a violation of biblical law. This supports the interpretation of <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 36:6\" href=\"/Exodus.36.6\"><i>Ex</i>. 36:6</a>.</i>”",
                "Rebbi Mana said it without attribution<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He did not ascribe the following remark to R. Joḥanan or any other earlier Amora.</i>; Rebbi Abin in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: We did state two principles which do not compare. “There are two kinds of oaths which are four kinds”; one has to bring four sacrifices<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishnah 3:1, explicit in <i>Sifra Ḥovah</i> (<i>Wayyiqra</i> 2) <i>Parašah</i> 9(8). For the four cases enumerated in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Shevuot 1:1:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shevuot.1.1.1\">Note 1</a>, R. Aqiba requires four separate sacrifices. R. Ismael infers from the forward-looking formulation of the verse that only future-directed oaths can trigger liability for a sacrifice. According to him, for separate oaths in the same period of oblivion at most two sacrifices may be due.</i>. “There are two kinds of appearances of skin disease which are four kinds”; one has to bring two sacrifices<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reference to skin disease also is in a difficult Genizah text (G, L. Ginzberg, <i>Yerushalmi Fragments from the Genizah</i>, New York 1909, p. 264 ff.) but it cannot be correct. The purification ceremony of the healed sufferer from skin disease is independent of the particular diagnosis by which he had been declared impure and the number of sacrifices due solely depends on his financial ability. The sequel shows that one has to read “there are two kinds of awareness of impurity which are four kinds,” the second clause in the Mishnah.<br>The difference between RR. Aqiba and Ismael is explained in <i>Sifra Ḥovah</i> (<i>Wayyiqra</i> 2) <i>Pereq</i> 12(7), <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Shevuot 14b\" href=\"/Shevuot.14b\">Babli 14b</a>. Both verses <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 5:2\" href=\"/Leviticus.5.2\"><i>Lev</i>. 5:2</a>,3 describe situations in which a person might become impure; they both end with the remark “it was hidden from him but then he knew and was found guilty,” i. e., he forgot about the impurity, entered the Sanctuary, and then became aware of his transgression. R. Aqiba holds that since impurity is mentioned twice but the Sanctuary only by inference, no sacrifice is due for causing impurity of the Sanctuary, only for entering it in impurity. R. Ismael holds that the repetition of the clause implies the obligation of a sacrifice both for impurity of the person and of the Sanctuary. R. Aqiba will hold that separate sacrifices might be due for impurity originating outside the person (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 5:2\" href=\"/Leviticus.5.2\">v. 2</a>) and that created in humans (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 5:3\" href=\"/Leviticus.5.3\">v. 3</a>). R. Ismael will hold that separate sacrifices are due for a human entering the Sanctuary in impurity and for the impurity thereby caused to the Sanctuary. The problem is that the Mishnah is anonymous, representing R. Meїr’s Mishnah, which is R. Aqiba’s tradition.</i>. Rebbi Eleazar in the name of Rebbi Abin<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Abin mentioned at the start of the paragraph is R. Abin the son, head of the Academy of Tiberias at the time of R. Mana in Sepphoris. The reading “R. Eleazar in the name of R. Abin” (In G: “in the name of R. Abun”, at a second occurrence “R. Eliezer ben R. Abun”) is impossible since R. Abin (Abun) the father lived a generation and a half after R. Eleazar. As already recognized by R. David Fraenckel (<i>Qorban Ha`edah ad loc</i>.) one must read “R. Eleazar bar Abinna”, a third generation Galilean Amora.</i> explained it otherwise: “There are two kinds of oaths which are four kinds” was said by Rebbi Aqiba; “there are two kinds of appearances of skin disease which are four kinds” by Rebbi Ismael<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Tanna of the Mishnah is not inconsistent in his use of parallel expressions but the two parallel sentences represent two different tannaןtic positions.</i>. Rebbi Ḥaggai asked before Rebbi Yose: why do I need to follow Rebbi Ismael? Does it not come even following Rebbi Aqiba? Knowing and forgetting about impurity of the Sanctuary is the same as knowing and forgetting about impurity of <i>sancta</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since Mishnah 2:1 explains that even R. Aqiba can hold that “there are two kinds of awareness of impurity which are four kinds” only if he distinguishes between awareness of impurity and awareness of the Sanctuary, there seems to be a possibility following him to require a sacrifice for infringing on the purity of the Sanctuary when there was awareness of impurity but oblivion of the Sanctuary.</i>. He told him, does not Rebbi Ismael have forgetting impurity and forgetting the Sanctuary, and we want to follow Rebbi Aqiba<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Only R. Ismael requires a sacrifice both for forgetting impurity of <i>sancta</i> and forgetting the Sanctuary (Mishnah 2:6). R. Ḥaggai’s inference is incorrect; R. Aqiba will not require a sacrifice in his case.</i>? Sometimes there is forgetting impurity and forgetting the Sanctuary but he is liable for only one sacrifice<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even following R. Ismael.</i>. How is this? If one became impure, realized it, then forgot about impurity, entered the Sanctuary, and left; then he became aware. Here is forgetting impurity and forgetting the Sanctuary but he is liable for only one sacrifice<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is no guilt attached to being impure. Guilt by impurity is incurred only if either the impure person enters the Sanctuary or eats from <i>sancta</i>. In the case in question there was only one forgetting; there is only one sacrifice required.<br>The sentence is missing in G.</i>. Sometimes there are many forgettings of impurity and many forgettings of the Sanctuary but he is liable for only one [sacrifice]. How [is this]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Text of G היךְ עבידה.</i>? If one became impure and realized it, then forgot and while being oblivious of impurity entered the Sanctuary and left; then he became aware<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is only one oblivion and only one sacrifice.<br>The sentence is missing in G.</i>. He said, there is no sacrifice due for this impurity. Again he became impure and realized it, then forgot and while being oblivious of impurity entered the Sanctuary and left even several times; in the end he became aware. Here are many forgettings of impurity and forgettings of the Sanctuary but he is liable for only one [sacrifice]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">At the first occasion, he was aware of the Sanctuary but he thought that for his kind of secondary impurity the Sanctuary was not forbidden. Then he entered several times while forgetting about the Sanctuary. Finally he realized his error concerning both impurity and Sanctuary. R. Ismael will agree that only one sacrifice is possible.</i>.",

He answered him, if not so, what should they have said?

This is characterized in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 13:2\" href=\"/Leviticus.13.2\"><i>Lev</i>. 13:2</a> as “<i>s´et</i>, adjoint, or shiny spot” which is read as “<i>s´et</i>, shiny spot, or one of their adjoints”. It is indicated that the Cohen has to determine the nature of the impurity but no details are given, possibly to reserve diagnosis to priests. The details therefore are left to tradition. In Mishnah <i>Nega`im</i> 1:1, “shiny spot” is defined by R. Meїr as color of fresh snow, <i>s´et</i> as color of eggshell (or the color of the membrane enclosing a hard boiled egg.) These colors are characterized as appearing as depressions on normal skin (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 13:3\" href=\"/Leviticus.13.3\"><i>Lev</i>. 13:3</a>). There are secondary forms for which the spots do not appear as if depressed (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 13:4\" href=\"/Leviticus.13.4\"><i>Lev</i>. 13:4</a>), these are described as the color of whitewash used in the Temple and that of white wool. The Sages disagreeing with R. Meїr declare eggshell as a secondary color. Since in the Tosephta eggshell is treated as secondary color, R. Meїr cannot represent the teachings of R.

But if judgment is suspended, i. e., if the heave may not be eaten by a Cohen for perhaps it is impure (when its consumption would be a deadly sin), but it cannot be burned for perhaps it is pure and then the destruction of <i>sancta</i> would be sinful, the water is considered impure and must be poured out on the ground to avoid further pollution.<br>The expression חַטָּאת biblically refers to the Red Cow (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Numbers 19:2\" href=\"/Numbers.19.2\"><i>Num.</i>19:2</a>), not to the water which is called מֵי נִדָּה “throwing water”.(<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Numbers 19:20-21\" href=\"/Numbers.19.20-21\"><i>Num</i>. 19:20–21</a>).</i>: “Any case of doubt which was declared pure for heave is pure for sprinkling water, and in any case where it remains unresolved for heave the sprinkling water is poured out.” There is nothing unresolved for the sprinkling water; either it is genuinely pure or genuinely impure.

Eating fat is always forbidden; eating sacrificial fat is illegitimate use of <i>sacra,</i> classified as larceny (requiring restitution and a reparation sacrifice); eating any <i>sacra</i> while impure is punishable by extirpation. The mention of the Day of Atonement shows that the Mishnah is formulated for the Rabbis, not R. Simeon. The question then is, if the statement of R. Joḥanan be true that an oath containing a general prohibition also refers to things biblically prohibited, the Tanna, who obviously is looking for an example showing the maximum of criminal acts that can be committed by one action, should have added that the person who ate the fat had previously made an oath that he would not eat at all, for a total of 6 sacrifices. That no oath is mentioned in the Mishnah seems to prove that R. Joḥanan’s position is rejected by the Mishnah; it cannot be accepted in practice.</i>? Rebbi Ze`ira said, in the whole lifetime of Rebbi Abba bar Mamal we did not find an answer; after he had died, we found an answer. Where do we stand?

Abba bar Mamal does not apply. But an oath to become vegetarian is a valid oath and in Temple times would prevent the person from fulfilling the commandment of eating of the Passover sacrifice. Since in contrast to vows oaths cannot be dissolved by a rabbi, this is a case where a general oath supersedes a biblical commandment.</i>; that I shall not eat during these ten days<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ten days of Penitence, from New Year’s day to and including the Day of Atonement.

Joḥanan it is difficult to find any oath involving meat that should be valid at all, since he requires an oath which forbids permitted foods; as a consequence it will also apply to prohibitions. But if somebody forbids himself anything which a person X will slaughter, the oath includes the fat of the slaughtered domestic animal forbidden by biblical standards.

Then the only problem is the problem that for R. Simeon the number of required sacrifices is not a measure of the number of prohibitions which were violated; the Tanna might want to formulate his statement to take care of R. Simeon’s opinions also.

Rules 8 and 9 mean that if the general statement can only be understood by the detail or vice versa, rules 5 and 6 do not apply. It then is explained in §7 that if a general statement is followed by a detail, only the detail is intended. §8: If a detail is followed by a general statement, the general statement adds to the detail. Examples are <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 1:2\" href=\"/Leviticus.1.2\"><i>Lev</i>. 1:2</a>: <i>From animals, from cattle, or from small cattle</i>. This implies that sacrifices are restricted to cattle, sheep, or goats. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 22:9\" href=\"/Exodus.22.9\"><i>Ex</i>. 22:9</a>: <i>A donkey, an ox, a sheep, or any animal</i>. The rules of caretakers apply to any animal. Then it becomes a problem how to treat a verse which contains general statement, detail, general statement, whether to apply rule 5 (eliminating the final general statement by rule 9), or rule 6 (eliminating the first general statement by rule 8), or rule 7. In the preceding derivation, the arguments have been suppressed that rules 8 and 9 do not apply and, therefore, only rule 7 is relevant. The standard example for an application of rule 7 is <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Deuteronomy 14:26\" href=\"/Deuteronomy.14.26\"><i>Deut</i>. 14:26</a>, about permitted uses of Second Tithe money at the place of the Sanctuary: <i>You may spend the money for anything you desire</i>(general), <i>for cattle, or small cattle, or wine, or liquor</i>(detail)<i>, or anything you wish</i>(general). The common denominator of the items in the detail describes animal or vegetable food; Second Tithe money can be used for any food derived from animals (generated from semen) or plants (growing from seeds).<br>Since the first part of <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 5:4\" href=\"/Leviticus.5.4\"><i>Lev</i>. 5:4</a> fits Rule 7, it is clear that the rule applies not only to oaths intended to cause good or evil but to a larger set of oaths which, however, have to conform to the idea underlying “causing good or bad things”. Obviously one of the ideas is that events caused are later in time than the cause. This is R. Ismael’s interpretation of the verse. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Shevuot 26a\" href=\"/Shevuot.26a\">Babli 26a</a>.</i>.

Meїr holds that an oath formulated by another person following the situation of v. 1 transferred to v. 21 cannot create liability for a sacrifice outside of court, but an oath pronounced by himself (v. 21) always creates such a liability.

If anything happens to the ox except cases of gross negligence, the trustee does not have to pay. The moment he uses the ox for his own purposes, he becomes liable for damages. Since he swears falsely that it was lost, he swears falsely for monetary gain and becomes liable. (Had he claimed that the ox was stolen, he would have had to pay the thief’s fine in addition to paying for the ox.) If he confesses in order to clear his conscience, he becomes eligible for atonement of his sin which is effected by paying an additional fifth (from above, i. e., a quarter from below) and a sacrifice in the value of 2 <i>šeqalim</i>.</i>.” The Mishnah [applies] if he does not know that there are witnesses. He comes to tell you, even if he knows that there are witnesses<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The formulation of the Mishnah shows clearly that there were witnesses available when he swore falsely. Nevertheless, he has to bring a sacrifice if he confesses. Why do R. Joḥanan and R. Simeon ben Laqish have to formulate a statement which clearly is implied by a Mishnah? The answer is that the Mishnah may be interpreted that the trustee swore falsely in the belief that there were no witnesses; he swore for monetary gain. The Amoraic statement adds that even had the trustee known of the existence of witnesses, only they were not present at the moment of his oath, it still is an oath for monetary gain since the witnesses might forget their testimony in the meantime. The formulation “he”, not “they”, in the last sentence may support the reading of the Babli which only mentions R. Joḥanan.</i>. Rebbi Yose said, the Mishnah says so: “If there were two groups of witnesses, if the first group reneged and after this the second, both are liable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishnah 4:4.</i>” One understands that the first group becomes liable<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This text is very difficult and all commentators and editors follow the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Shevuot 32b-33a\" href=\"/Shevuot.32b-33a\">Babli (32b/33a</a>) and switch the places of “first” and “second”, for the reasons explained in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Shevuot 4:3:4\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shevuot.4.3.4\">Halakhah 4:4, Note 54</a>. But this seems to be excluded by the text of G, which becomes the more credible as its scribe clearly did not understand the text since he misread מצוּיִין “being apt to” as מצֻוִּים “being commanded”.<br>Therefore one is forced to explain that the first group clearly violates their oath of testimony by reneging on it. The question is why the second group is not freed from their obligation by the first since strictly speaking only two witnesses are needed by biblical standards; any additional witnesses appear superfluous. The answer is that additional witnesses never are superfluous since any witness may forget, if not the whole incident so some detail which might invalidate his testimony in cross examination. One knows that the testimony of a group of witnesses is valid only <i>after</i> it was accepted in court.</i>. Why the second? Not because they might forget their testimony? <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Added from G; cf. the preceding Note.</i>[Here also, because they (are commanded) to forget their testimony.]",

This would be covered by “robbery” listed in v. 21. Rather it is that the person searching for his lost property, such as his donkey mares, asks a person whether he knows either of the property or of the person who might have taken it. If he under oath falsely denies any knowledge, according to this Tanna be becomes liable for a sacrifice only if he wrongly denies knowledge about the property, not about the person who might have appropriated it.<br>The big question then becomes, why should the person asked for testimony be liable for anything since by necessity he is a single person and the testimony of a single person cannot force a judgment. As Ravad explains in his Commentary to <i>Sifra</i>, this argument would be unconditionally valid only for oaths about testimony, not for oaths about causing monetary loss. His scenario is, e. g., that the lost animal was standing on another person’s property. The original owner took it but now the person from whom it was taken claims ownership and wants it back.

The answer is that different biblical verses are the basis. Since a Hebrew slave girl is a minor sold by her father for a maximum of 6 years, or until she reaches the age of 12, or until she is married by the person who buys her or one of his sons. In order to get the maximum for his money, the man buying her might use her as a servant up to the last day of her servitude and then marry her on that day. Since if the original price is divided by the sum of all days of her servitude and only pennies pay for the service of one day, only pennies are left on the last day but nevertheless the marriage is legal. Therefore only pennies are needed for a legal marriage ceremony.</i> The claim, the House of Shammai say, an <i>obolos</i>, but the House of Hillel say, two <i>oboloi</i>. The argument of the House of Shammai seems inverted. There, they say, “silver” is a <i>denar</i>, but here, they say that “silver” is an <i>obolos</i>. The argument of the House of Hillel seems inverted. There, they say that “money” is a <i>peruṭah</i> but here, they say that “money” is two <i>oboloi</i>. Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa in the name of Rebbi Ḥanina: The House of Shammai learn from the initial sale of a Hebrew girl. Since her initial sale was by [at least] a <i>denar</i>, so her preliminary marriage is by [at least] a <i>denar</i>. The House of Hillel learn from the end of her diminution. Since the end of her diminution is a <i>peruṭah,</i> so her preliminary marriage is by a <i>peruṭah.</i> What is the reason of the House of Shammai?

Would we not know that it is without money? Why does the verse say, <i>without silver</i>? From there, that she is sold for more than silver. And what is more than silver? A <i>denar</i>.

Rebbi Abun said, think of it. If she wanted to compute the diminution at the start of the sixth year, there would be a <i>peruṭah</i> left.

Rebbi Ḥananiah in the name of Rebbi Phineas, our Mishnah said so: “If he was pulling it to lead it out but it died on the owner’s property, he is not liable.

The dishonest keeper in the opinion of the House of Shammai has to pay the larger of the values of the object either at the time it was given to him or when it should have been returned. The House of Hillel makes him pay the value at the time he took possession, R. Aqiba the value at the time of the claim. This has nothing to do with the problem here. The Mishnah there continues: “If somebody intends to take the deposit, the House of Shammai hold him liable, but the House of Hillel say, he is liable only from the moment he takes it.” Since in the public domain acquisition is effected only by lifting the object, not by dragging it, liability for cattle rustling in the public domain exists only for the House of Shammai.</i>?

Therefore no sacrifice is due.</i>.<br>“Where is my ox?” He told him, “I do not know.” “What are you telling?” But if had died, or broke, or was abducted, or stolen, or lost. “I want you to swear;” he answered “Amen”. He is liable<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">86</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He denies ever having borrowed an ox. His oath is to the detriment of the owner; a sacrifice is due in addition to the restitution of 125% of the value.</i>.<br>He said to the recipient of a fee or to a renter, “where is my ox?” He told him, “it died,” but it broke or was abducted; “it broke,” but it died or was abducted; “it was abducted,” but it died or broke; “it was stolen,” but it was lost; “it was lost,” but it was stolen. “I want you to swear;” if he said “Amen”, he is not liable.<br>“It died, or it broke, or it was abducted,” when it was stolen or lost. “I want you to swear;” if he said “Amen”, he is liable. “It was lost, or stolen,” when it died, or broke, or was abducted; he is not liable. This is the principle: Anybody who swears to his benefit is liable, to his detriment is not liable.",
                "<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> It was stated: If it was neither to his benefit nor to his detriment, he is liable<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">126</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is a <i>baraita</i> which disagrees with the Mishnah and holds that a false oath is a false oath even if the false formulation does no harm to the other party.</i>. Rebbi said, a <i>baraita</i> says so: “If he said to the borrower, the unpaid trustee, the recipient of a fee, or the renter, ‘where is my ox?’ This one said, ‘it died.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">127</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tosephta 6:7 starts in this way; but the <i>baraita</i> must have the person who swore falsely not to the detriment of the depositor as liable to the penalties of a false oath.</i>” May he tell him, “come and swear to me that you never thought of rustling it”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">128,</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Could the depositor ask that the paid trustee or renter, or even the borrower, who paid for the lost or stolen object, nevertheless swear that they do not hold the object in their possession? The first argument is against, for the oath will not change the monetary situation. The second argument is in favor; there is a value to one’s own possession which cannot be expressed in monetary terms. The answer is not given, nor is the question raised in the Babli. In the absence of guidance, a court cannot act.</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The owner of an object stolen from an unpaid keeper. If he cannot recoup his loss he might be tempted to let the keeper swear in the hope that he might prefer to pay rather than swear.</i>? In any case he would not pay; what could he say? “Even if you would pay me a lot, I want from you what is mine.”"
