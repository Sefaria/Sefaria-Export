                "<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The main application of the Mishnah is to bankruptcy problems where the amount available for distribution is not sufficient to cover all claims. The principle underlying the distribution has been explained at length in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 10:4:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.10.4.1\"><i>Ketubot</i> 10:4, Note 62</a>.</i> If two persons hold on to one toga and each of them says “I found it” [or] “it wholly belongs to me”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Each of them has to grab a similar length of cloth, to establish equality of claims.</i>, each of them has to swear that he owns no less than half of it and they shall divide it evenly<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There are no witnesses nor other kinds of proof; the case has to be settled by judicial oath. It is obvious that if the two claimants do not agree to possess the object in common it has to be split evenly. If both of them are ready to swear that the object entirely belongs to him, at least one of them is swearing falsely. Since the formulation of the oath is in the hand of the judges, they must be careful not to teach the parties to swear to a falsehood; they cannot let them swear about full ownership, for the court is warned (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 23:1\" href=\"/Exodus.23.1\"><i>Ex.</i>23:1</a>) “not to lend a hand to a wicked person to be an extortionary witness”, i. e., it is forbidden to administer an oath to a known felon (Mishnah <i>Šebuot</i> 7:4). But if each party only swear to the amount it actually will receive, it is possible that both swear to the truth. The formulation “no less than” implies that the oath is true even if one of them is the full owner; the language of the oaths does not contradict the claims brought before the court.</i>. If one says “it wholly belongs to me” and one says “half of it belongs to me”, the one who says “it wholly belongs to me” shall swear that he owns no less than three parts<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">3/4. The language of “parts” follows the Egyptian (and Roman) pattern; <i>n parts</i> always means <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">n</sup>/<sub>n</sub><sub>+1</sub>.</i> and the one who says “half of it belongs to me” shall swear that he owns no less than a quarter<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As explained in <i>Ketubot,</i> the underlying principle is: “Amounts in doubt are split evenly”. If neither party has proof by document or witnesses and A claims 100% of an amount available but B only claims 50%, 50% are assigned to A as undisputed amount. The remaining 50% are in dispute and have to be split evenly; each of the the parties receives 25%.</i>. The first one takes three parts, the second takes a fourth.",
                "<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If two people hold on to one stole,” etc. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A parallel but different text is in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 2:1:4\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.2.1.4\"><i>Ketubot</i> 2:1, Notes 12–15</a>.</i> It was stated: One person said to another, give me the mina<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Greek <i>mina</i> of 100 drachmas (denars). <i>Zuz,</i> “half sheqel” is the talmudic name of the denar.</i> which you owe me. He answered, it never happened. He went and brought witnesses that the other owed him 50 <i>zuz.</i> The elder Rebbi Ḥiyya said, the confession of the witnesses is the same as his own confession; he has to swear about the remainder<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A similar text, formulated as R. Ḥiyya’s statement, is quoted in the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Bava Metzia 3a\" href=\"/Bava_Metzia.3a\">Babli, 3a</a>. The oath required here is the biblical “oath imposed by the judges”, Mishnah <i>Ševu‘ot</i> 6:1 based on <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 22:8\" href=\"/Exodus.22.8\"><i>Ex.</i> 22:8</a>. The rabbinic interpretation of the biblical expression אֲשֶׁר יֹאמַר כִּי הוּא זֶה is “if he [the defendant] agrees that there be a case.” If the defendant in a civil suit, in which there are no witnesses or documents, denies the entire claim, he does not have to swear a biblical oath (he may have to swear a rabbinical oath). But if he agrees to part of the claim, he has to swear a biblical oath to free himself from the remainder. Only if the claim is advanced as tentative, then any admission by the defendant is a gift to the claimant and by rabbinic rule no oath of any kind is due. (Cf. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 5:10:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.5.10.1\"><i>Giṭṭin</i> 5:3, Note 84</a>).</i>. Rebbi Joḥanan said, the confession of the witnesses is not the same as his own confession that he should have to swear<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Exodus 22:8\" href=\"/Exodus.22.8\"><i>Ex.</i> 22:8</a> insists on the defendant’s agreeing to part of the claim, witnesses can never force a judicial oath. This opinion is not mentioned in the Babli. In <i>Ketubot</i>(<i>loc. cit.</i> Note 7), R. Joḥanan denies that the oath is biblical; its rules cannot be determined by biblical arguments.</i>. Rebbi La said, Rebbi Ḥiyya the elder’s statement is implied by “if two people hold on to one stole”. Since he holds on to half of it, is it not as if he brought witnesses that one half belongs to him? Could one not say that he swears and collects<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The argument is refuted. Since each party claims the entire stole, each one is disputing half of a claim. There is no claimant nor defendant; even R. Ḥiyya must agree that the oath imposed by the Mishnah is not biblical.</i>? Is this a similar case<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For R. Ḥiyya, the case of the <i>baraita</i> is biblical; R. La’s argument is impossible. (In <i>Ketubot,</i> R. La quotes R. Joḥanan’s statement in the next paragraph.)</i>?",
                "This topic<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The oath prescribed in the Mishnah.</i> came up between Rebbi Abba bar Mamal and Rav Amram. One said, one does not entrust an oath to a suspect person<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">How is this oath possible? Cf. <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Bava Metzia 1:1:1\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Metzia.1.1.1\">Note 3</a>.</i>. The other said, one does not even formulate an oath for such a one<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The formulation of the oath in the Mishnah still leaves the court open to a charge of administering an oath which helps a person to be dishonest since one could read the text as: “An oath that I have no claim to it, less than half.” Therefore, a positive statement of claim has to be inserted into the formula. The same formula is attributed to Rav Huna in the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Bava Metzia 5b\" href=\"/Bava_Metzia.5b\">Babli, 5b</a>.</i>. Rav Huna said: “An oath that I have property rights to it to the amount of no less than (the value of a <i>peruṭah</i>)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Reading of the Leiden ms., a scribal error.</i> [half of its value]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Text of E, confirmed by the Babli.</i>. Rebbi Joḥanan said, if it is about this, it is an institutional oath<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He disagrees with R. Ḥiyya and holds that the oath is purely an <i>ad hoc</i> instituted rabbinical ordinance.

                "One says, half is mine; the other says, a third is mine. The one who says that half is his shall swear that no less than a quarter be his; the one who says that a third is his shall swear that no less than a sixth be his. The principle involved: One only swears on half of what he agreed to<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On the face of it, the paragraph is unintelligible. R. E. Fulda comments: “I do not feel empowered to emend.” The corresponding <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Tosefta Bava Metzia (Lieberman) 1:2\" href=\"/Tosefta_Bava_Metzia_(Lieberman).1.2\">Tosephta (1:2</a>) is clear:<br>“One says, <i>all</i> is mine; the other says, a third is mine. The one who says that all is his shall swear that no less than five parts (5/6) are his; the one who says that a third is his shall swear that no less than a sixth is his. The principle involved: One only swears on half of what he agreed to.”<br>In the case of the Tosephta, the second claimant surrenders 2/3 to the first. Only 1/3 is in dispute; it is split evenly. The first one receives 2/3 + 1/6 = 5/6; the second receives 1/6. Rabbinic practice decrees that one only swears on half of the amount which is in dispute; in this case each would swear that he owns no less that one sixth in addition to what he has by consensus [Maimonides, <i>Ṭo‘en weniṭ‘an</i>9:8 (<i>Maggid Mišneh ad</i> 9:9), <i>Šulḥan ‘Arukh Ḥošen Mišpaṭ</i> 138:2 (Note)].<br>In the Yerushalmi the total of the claims only adds up to 5/6; they can be satisfied in full. There is no reason why anybody should swear. One has to explain the <i>baraita</i> as dealing with a case of bankruptcy in which the claims themselves are not sufficiently documented and can each be considered only by an affirmatory oath.</i>."

If the deed was returned to the creditor, the latter might use it against an innocent buyer who would not know that it had been liquidated.

Joḥanan’s lifetime. <i>Lekan</i> was proposed in <i>Ma‘aśer Šeni</i> 4:1, Note 22, as “small measure or weight”, i. e. local small change which in the Mishnah had been defined as merchandise when compared with silver. {The computation of R.

The second word is identified by Krauss in <i>Additamenta ad librum Aruch Completum</i> as <i>turzello.</i> M. Sachs (J. Levy, S. Krauss) identifies אמבורוקלון as Latin <i>involucrum</i> “wrapper; covering; envelope”, from <i>involvo</i> “to wrap up, roll up.”. <i>Turzello,</i> from Latin <i>tortus</i> “a twisting, winding”, from <i>torqueo</i> “to twist, to turn” is an acceptable translation of <i>involucrum.</i> In this interpretation, the statement implies that the laws of barter also apply if something is exchanged against an object of the same kind. It is difficult to understand why this should not be so.<br>H. Y. D. Azulay, in his פתח עיניים, quotes from the ms. of R. Menaḥem di Lonzano בדיקלין באמה בדיקלין. E: אמלוקנין באמבוליקין.<br>However, Maimonides connects the statement with the later Mishnaiot whose subject is the cancellation of a sale because of overcharging by the seller or underpaying by the buyer. He reads the statement as meaning that a barter is concluded the moment one of the parties takes possession of the object coming to him, and no legal recourse exists for the party realizing that he made a bad bargain. He must hold that אברוקלון and אמבורוקלון are two different objects. It is possible that he reads the two words as “needle” and “silk cloth” since he writes (<i>Mekhirah</i> 13:1): “One who barters vessels agains vessels or animals against animals, even a needle for silk cloth or a kid goat for a horse, has no claim of overcharging since he might prefer a needle to silk cloth.” The horse is specifically exempt from the rules of overcharging in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Bava Metzia 4:6:2\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Metzia.4.6.2\">Halakhah 4, Note 132</a>.
