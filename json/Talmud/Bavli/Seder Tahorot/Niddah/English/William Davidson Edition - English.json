            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Shammai <b>says:</b> For <b>all women</b> who do not have a fixed menstrual cycle, <b>their time is sufficient.</b> Women who discern that menstrual blood emerged do not need to be concerned that perhaps the flow of blood began before they noticed it. Rather, they assume their ritual impurity status begins at that moment, in terms of rendering impure <i>teruma</i> and ritually pure items with which they come in contact. <b>Hillel says: From examination [<i>mipekida</i>] to examination,</b> i.e., she assumes ritual impurity status retroactive to the last time she examined herself and determined that she was ritually pure, <b>and</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> if her examination took place <b>several days</b> earlier. Any ritually pure item with which she came in contact in the interim becomes ritually impure.",
            "<b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The <i>halakha</i> is <b>neither in accordance with the statement of this</b> <i>tanna</i> <b>nor in accordance with the statement of that</b> <i>tanna</i>; <b>rather,</b> the principle is: A twenty-four-hour <b>period reduces</b> the time <b>from examination to examination.</b> In other words, if her final self-examination took place more than twenty-four hours earlier, she need only concern herself with ritual impurity for the twenty-four-hour period prior to discerning the blood. <b>And from examination to examination reduces</b> the time <b>from</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period.</b> In other words, if she examined herself in the course of the previous day and discovered no blood, she was certainly ritually pure prior to the examination.",
            "For <b>any woman who has a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle [<i>veset</i>],</b> and she examined herself at that time and discovered blood, <b>her time is sufficient,</b> and it is only from that time that she transmits ritual impurity. <b>And</b> with regard to a woman <b>who engages in intercourse while</b> using <b>examination cloths [<i>be’edim</i>]</b> before and after intercourse, with which she ascertains whether her menstrual flow began, the halakhic status of such an action <b>is like that of an examination, and</b> therefore <b>it reduces</b> the time <b>from</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period, and</b> reduces the time <b>from examination to examination.</b>",
            "<b>Her time is sufficient, how so?</b> If the woman <b>was sitting in the bed and engaged in</b> handling <b>ritually pure items, and she left</b> the bed <b>and saw</b> blood, <b>she is ritually impure and</b> those items <b>are ritually pure.</b>",
            "<b>Although</b> the Rabbis <b>said</b> that a woman without a fixed menstrual cycle <b>transmits ritual impurity</b> retroactively <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period,</b> a woman with a fixed cycle <b>counts</b> her menstrual days <b>only from the moment that she saw</b> blood.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that when a woman discerns that her menstrual blood emerged, Shammai holds that her impurity status starts from that moment, while Hillel maintains that it begins from the time of her most recent self-examination. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Shammai?</b> The Gemara answers: Shammai <b>holds</b> that as there is a principle that when the status of an item is uncertain it retains its presumptive status, here too: <b>Establish</b> the <b>woman in her presumptive status, and a woman remains with the presumptive status of</b> being <b>ritually pure. And</b> what is the reasoning of <b>Hillel?</b> He claims that <b>when</b> one <b>states</b> the principle: <b>Establish an item in its presumptive status,</b> that applies only <b>where there is no weakening</b> in the presumptive status that is a result <b>of</b> the item <b>itself. But</b> in the case of <b>a woman,</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>since</b> it is her nature <b>to see</b> blood flow <b>from her body</b> at regular intervals, <b>we do not say: Establish her in her presumptive status</b> of ritual purity. Her body is constantly changing, and therefore she has no such presumptive status.",
            "With regard to the opinions of both Shammai and Hillel, the Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from</b> that of <b>a ritual bath? As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 2:2): In the case of <b>a ritual bath</b> that was known to have contained the requisite forty <i>se’a</i>, <b>which was</b> then <b>measured and found lacking</b> in its quantity of water, <b>all pure items that had been rendered</b> pure <b>in it,</b> i.e., any impure items that had been purified through immersion in this ritual bath, <b>retroactive</b> to when the ritual bath was last measured, <b>whether</b> this ritual bath is found <b>in the private domain or in the public domain, are impure.</b>",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Shammai,</b> the mishna poses <b>a difficulty from</b> its statement that the change in the ritual bath’s status is assumed <b>retroactive</b> to the time when it was last measured, as he maintains that a menstruating woman’s status changes only at the present moment, not retroactive to the last time she examined herself.",
            "<b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Hillel,</b> the mishna also poses <b>a difficulty</b> with regard to its ruling that the items purified in the ritual bath are deemed impure with <b>certainty, whereas</b> a menstruating women does not assume retroactive impurity with certainty. In other words, although according to the Rabbis there is a twenty-four-hour <b>period</b> of retroactive ritual impurity in the case <b>of a menstruating woman,</b> and according to Hillel the retroactive impurity extends back to her most recent examination, nevertheless any <i>teruma</i> that she touched during that period is not deemed definitely impure to the extent that it must be burned. Rather, the impure status of the items she touched is uncertain and the status of the <i>teruma</i> is <b>suspended,</b> i.e., one may <b>neither eat</b> it <b>nor burn</b> it. <b>Whereas here,</b> in the case of the ritual bath, any item purified in it is retroactively deemed <b>definitely impure.</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the case of a ritual bath, it is different, <b>since it can be said: Establish</b> the <b>impure</b> item <b>in its presumptive status and say</b> that <b>it was not</b> properly <b>immersed.</b> In other words, the presumptive status of the item as ritually impure is in keeping with the current deficient state of the ritual bath. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>On the contrary,</b> one should <b>establish the ritual bath in its presumptive state</b> of validity <b>and say that</b> the ritual bath <b>was not</b> previously <b>lacking</b> the requisite measure of water. The Gemara responds: There is no presumptive state of validity, as the ritual bath <b>is lacking before you,</b> i.e., at present, and this offsets the presumptive status that it was full.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Here too,</b> in the case of a menstruating woman, she is one who has experienced a discharge of <b>blood before you,</b> i.e., at present. Just as the ritual bath’s presumptive status of validity is offset by its present lack of the requisite measure of water, so too the woman’s previous presumptive status of ritual purity is offset by her present state of impurity due to menstruation. The Gemara answers: In the case of the menstruating woman, it is possible that <b>it is</b> only <b>now that she saw</b> the first emission of her menstrual blood. The Gemara retorts: One can say the same with regard to the ritual bath: <b>Here too, it is</b> only <b>now that</b> it <b>became lacking</b> in the requisite measure of water.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> in the case of the ritual bath, <b>it can be said</b> that the water slowly trickled out and consequently the amount of water was <b>continuously diminishing.</b> Therefore, it is possible that the ritual bath lost its valid status long ago without anyone realizing. By contrast, <b>here,</b> with regard to a menstruating woman, <b>can it be said</b> that she was <b>continuously seeing</b> menstrual blood? The Gemara responds: <b>And what is the difficulty?</b> The same possibility does in fact exist in the case of a menstruating woman, as <b>perhaps she saw</b> the blood depart <b>bit [<i>hagas</i>] by bit.</b>",
            "The Gemara states a different answer: <b>There,</b> in the case of the ritual bath, <b>there are two</b> factors <b>that weaken</b> the suggestion that the items are ritually pure: First, the ritual bath is lacking at present; second, the item has a presumptive status of impurity. <b>Here,</b> by contrast, <b>there is</b> only <b>one</b> factor <b>that weakens</b> the possibility that the items touched by the currently menstruating woman were rendered ritually impure, i.e., that she is currently experiencing a menstrual flow. Therefore, according to Shammai she assumes impurity status only from that moment onward, and according to Hillel her retroactive impurity status applies only as an uncertainty.",
            "§ The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to Shammai, who holds that her time is sufficient and there is no retroactive impurity, <b>what is different</b> in the case <b>of a barrel? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Terumot</i> 2:8): If someone <b>would inspect</b> the contents of <b>a barrel</b> to see if it still contained enough wine <b>to continually</b> mentally <b>separate <i>teruma</i> from it,</b> i.e., to exempt other untithed wine of his until all the wine in this barrel will be <i>teruma</i>, <b>and afterward</b> the contents of the barrel <b>were found</b> to have turned to <b>vinegar,</b> which cannot be set aside as <i>teruma</i> for untithed wine, then for <b>all of the first three days</b> following his most recent inspection, it is <b>definitely</b> considered to have been wine. Therefore, any of the untithed wine for which <i>teruma</i> was separated during those days is tithed.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>From that</b> point <b>forward,</b> i.e., more than three days after the most recent inspection, it is <b>uncertain</b> whether it had already turned to vinegar, and consequently any untithed wine for which <i>teruma</i> was separated during those days remains uncertainly tithed. This poses <b>a difficulty for Shammai,</b> who maintains that there is no such retroactive consideration in the case of a menstruating woman.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the case of the barrel, it is different, <b>since it can be said: Establish the untithed produce in its presumptive status,</b> as when it first grew it was definitely untithed, <b>and say</b> it was <b>not amended,</b> i.e., exempted, and its status continues to be untithed produce. The Gemara asks: <b>On the contrary,</b> one should <b>establish the wine in its presumptive status, and say</b> that it had <b>not turned to vinegar.</b>",
            "The Gemara rejects this suggestion: This is impossible, as <b>it is turned to vinegar before you,</b> i.e., at present. The Gemara replies: <b>Here too,</b> in the case of a menstruating woman, one who has experienced a discharge of <b>blood</b> is <b>before you,</b> at present, so what is the difference? The Gemara explains: With regard to the woman, it is possible that <b>it is</b> only <b>now that she saw</b> the beginning of her menstrual blood. The Gemara responds: <b>There too,</b> it is possible that <b>it is</b> only <b>now that it turned to vinegar,</b> but not earlier.",
            "The Gemara again answers: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> in the case of the wine, <b>it can be said</b> that it was <b>continuously turning to vinegar.</b> Therefore, it is possible that the wine turned to vinegar much earlier without anyone realizing. By contrast, in the case of the menstruating woman, <b>can it be said</b> that she was <b>continuously seeing</b> menstrual blood? Once again, the Gemara responds: <b>And what is the difficulty?</b> The same possibility does in fact exist in the case of a menstruating woman, as <b>perhaps she saw</b> the blood depart <b>bit by bit.</b>",
            "The Gemara provides a different answer: <b>There,</b> in the case of the barrel, there are <b>two</b> factors <b>that weaken</b> the suggestion that the wine is tithed: First, it is vinegar at present; second, the wine has a presumptive status that it is untithed. <b>Here,</b> by contrast, <b>there is</b> only <b>one</b> factor <b>that weakens</b> the possibility that the items touched by the menstruating woman were rendered ritually impure, i.e., that she is currently experiencing a menstrual flow.",
            "§ <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction between</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the <b>barrel</b> and that <b>of</b> the <b>ritual bath: What is different here,</b> in the case of the ritual bath, where the items are <b>definitely</b> impure, <b>and what is different there,</b> with regard to the barrel, where it is only <b>uncertain</b> that the produce remains untithed? In both cases the current situation, that the ritual bath is deficient and the contents of the barrel have turned to vinegar, should lead to a definite status.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Ḥanina of Sura says: Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the <b>barrel? It is Rabbi Shimon, who, with regard to a ritual bath also considers it</b> as a matter of <b>uncertainty,</b> rather than as definitely impure. Therefore, there is no contradiction between the two <i>halakhot</i>.",
            "<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 2:2): In the case of <b>a ritual bath</b> that was known to have contained the requisite forty <i>se’a</i>, <b>which was</b> then <b>measured and found lacking</b> in its quantity of water, <b>all pure items that had been rendered</b> pure <b>in it,</b> i.e., any impure items that had been purified through immersion in this ritual bath, <b>retroactive</b> to when the ritual bath was last measured, <b>whether</b> this ritual bath is located <b>in the private domain or in the public domain, are impure.</b>",
            "The mishna continues: <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> If the impure items were immersed in a ritual bath that was <b>in the public domain,</b> they are deemed <b>pure.</b> But if they were immersed in a ritual bath that was <b>in a private domain,</b> the status of any <i>teruma</i> that touched them is <b>suspended,</b> i.e., it is neither consumed nor burned. Rabbi Shimon holds that even in the case of a ritual bath, the items are not retroactively deemed definitely impure. Rather the status is uncertain, just as in the case of the barrel."
        ],
        [
            "The Gemara explains their reasoning: <b>And both</b> <i>tanna’im</i> <b>derived</b> their respective opinions <b>only from</b> the case of <b>a woman suspected by her husband of having been unfaithful [<i>sota</i>],</b> who is forbidden to engage in intercourse with her husband just like a definite adulteress.",
            "<b>The Rabbis hold:</b> This case of a ritual bath is <b>like</b> the case of <b>a <i>sota</i>. Just as</b> in the case of <b>a <i>sota</i></b> it is <b>uncertain</b> whether <b>she</b> was actually unfaithful, <b>and</b> nevertheless the Torah <b>rendered her like</b> one who <b>definitely</b> committed adultery in that she is forbidden to her husband until she drinks the water of a <i>sota</i>; <b>here too,</b> in the case of a ritual bath, it is <b>uncertain</b> whether it was lacking the requisite measure of water <b>and</b> yet the Torah <b>rendered it as</b> though it was <b>definitely</b> lacking water, to the extent that <i>teruma</i> that touched an item that had been immersed in it must be burned.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of the ritual bath are derived <b>from</b> those of <b>a <i>sota</i>,</b> then one can <b>say</b> that it should be <b>like</b> the <i>halakha</i> of a <b><i>sota</i></b> in another respect: <b>Just as a <i>sota</i></b> who is suspected of having been unfaithful <b>in a public domain</b> is considered <b>pure,</b> i.e., she does not undergo to rite of a <i>sota</i>, <b>here too,</b> any impure item that was immersed in a currently deficient ritual bath that is situated <b>in a public domain</b> should be considered <b>pure.</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared?</b> One cannot apply the <i>halakha</i> of a <i>sota</i> in a public domain to any other case. <b>There,</b> the reason why a <i>sota</i> is treated as having definitely been unfaithful is <b>due to</b> her <b>seclusion</b> with another man. <b>And</b> as a proper <b>seclusion in the public domain is not</b> possible, she does not assume the status of a <i>sota</i>. By contrast, <b>here,</b> in the case of the ritual bath, the uncertainty <b>is due to</b> the <b>lack</b> of the requisite measure of water in the ritual bath. If so, <b>what</b> difference is it <b>to me</b> if the ritual bath is <b>lacking in a public domain</b> or if it is <b>lacking in a private domain?</b>",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>And if you would say</b> that the guiding principle in <b>any</b> case of <b>uncertainty</b> involving <b>impurity in a public domain</b> is that it is <b>ritually pure,</b> and therefore all items immersed in a ritual bath situated in the public domain should be pure even if there is uncertainty about its status of purity, that suggestion can be rejected, as follows: <b>Since there are two</b> factors <b>that weaken</b> the possibility that the items are ritually pure: First, the ritual bath is currently lacking, and second, the item has a presumptive status of impurity, it is therefore <b>considered as</b> an item of <b>definite impurity.</b>",
            "After analyzing the reasoning of the Rabbis, the Gemara turns to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon. <b>And Rabbi Shimon holds:</b> This case of a ritual bath is just <b>like</b> the case of <b>a <i>sota</i>. Just as a <i>sota</i></b> who is suspected of having been unfaithful <b>in a public domain</b> is considered <b>pure, here too,</b> any impure item that was immersed in a currently deficient ritual bath that is situated <b>in a public domain</b> is considered <b>pure.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of the ritual bath are derived <b>from</b> those of <b>a <i>sota</i>,</b> then one can <b>say</b> that it should be <b>like</b> the <i>halakha</i> of a <b><i>sota</i></b> in another respect: <b>Just as a <i>sota</i></b> who secluded herself with the man <b>in a private domain</b> is deemed <b>definitely impure,</b> i.e., she is forbidden to her husband until she undergoes the rite of the <i>sota</i>, <b>here too,</b> any ritually impure item that was immersed in a currently deficient ritual bath situated <b>in a private domain</b> should be considered <b>definitely impure.</b> If so, any <i>teruma</i> that comes in contact with the immersed vessel should be burned. Why, then, does Rabbi Shimon rule that its status is suspended and it is neither consumed nor burned?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> in the case of a <i>sota</i>, <b>there is a basis for the matter.</b> She is considered definitely impure, <b>as</b> her husband <b>issued a warning to her</b> about this particular man <b>and she</b> then <b>secluded</b> herself with him. By contrast, <b>here,</b> in the case of a ritual bath, <b>what basis for the matter is there?</b> Why should one assume impurity with certainty?",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>this is</b> the <b>reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon:</b> He does not base his ruling on the case of a <i>sota</i>; rather, he <b>derives the end of impurity from the beginning of impurity,</b> i.e., he derives the <i>halakha</i> of the immersion of an impure item into a ritual bath from the <i>halakha</i> of the initial contraction of ritual impurity.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>Just as</b> with regard to the <b>beginning of impurity,</b> if there is <b>uncertainty whether or not</b> a pure item <b>came into contact</b> with a source of impurity, if this occurred <b>in the public domain</b> it is considered ritually <b>pure; so too</b> in the case of the <b>end of impurity,</b> if there is <b>uncertainty whether or not</b> the impure item was <b>immersed</b> in a ritual bath with the requisite amount of water, the <i>halakha</i> is that if the ritual bath is located <b>in the public domain,</b> the item is considered <b>pure.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how would <b>the Rabbis</b> respond to this claim? They would respond: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> with regard to the beginning of impurity, <b>the man</b> who might have touched an impure item <b>remains with the presumptive status</b> of <b>ritual purity.</b> Consequently, <b>we do not lower his</b> status to one who has contracted <b>ritual impurity</b> merely <b>due to uncertainty. Here,</b> in the case of the ritual bath, <b>the man</b> who immerses in that ritual bath <b>has the presumptive status</b> of <b>ritual impurity.</b> Therefore, <b>we do not remove him</b> from <b>his</b> status <b>of ritual impurity due to uncertainty.</b>",
            "§ The Gemara returns to its analysis of the mishna. Shammai said: For all women, their time is sufficient, i.e., women who discern that menstrual blood emerged do not need to be concerned that perhaps the flow of blood began before they noticed it. The Gemara asks: In <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from</b> that of <b>an alleyway? As we learned</b> in a mishna (66a): With regard to the carcass of <b>a creeping animal that is found in an alleyway,</b> it <b>renders</b> any item in the alleyway <b>ritually impure retroactively to</b> the time <b>that</b> a person can <b>say: I examined this alleyway and there was no</b> carcass of <b>a creeping animal in it, or until the time of the</b> last <b>sweeping</b> of the alleyway.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>There too,</b> one can explain: <b>Since there</b> are two types of carcasses of creeping animals that are likely to be found in the alleyway, <b>creeping animals from</b> the alleyway <b>itself and creeping animals that came from the world</b> at large, <b>it is compared to</b> a case where there <b>are two</b> factors <b>that weaken</b> the possibility that the items are ritually pure. Therefore, even Shammai agrees that in such a case the impurity extends retroactively back in time.",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>this is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Shammai: Since a women senses within herself</b> if she is experiencing a flow of blood, if she felt the flow only at present, it is certain that she did not experience a flow previously. <b>And Hillel</b> holds that she might have experienced a flow earlier while she was urinating and <b>she thought it</b> was all <b>the sensation of</b> her flow of <b>urine.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Shammai, isn’t there</b> the case of <b>a sleeping</b> woman, who would not sense her flow of menstrual blood? The Gemara answers: <b>A sleeping</b> woman would <b>also</b> sense her flow, and <b>due to her discomfort</b> she <b>would awaken, just as it is with the sensation</b> of the need to <b>urinate.</b>",
            "The Gemara raises another difficulty with regard to the opinion of Shammai: <b>But there</b> is the case of <b>a mentally incompetent</b> woman, who does not properly understand what she is sensing. She might have previously experienced a flow of menstrual blood that she did not notice. The Gemara answers: <b>Shammai concedes</b> in the case <b>of a mentally incompetent</b> woman that she is impure retroactively. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> the mishna explicitly <b>teaches</b> that Shammai mentioned <b>all women,</b> which apparently includes even the mentally incompetent. The Gemara answers: When the mishna teaches: <b>All women,</b> it is referring to all <b>mentally competent</b> women.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> if so, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> that Shammai’s opinion applies to: <b>Women,</b> rather than referring to all women. The Gemara answers: The inclusive statement: All women, serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer. As Rabbi Eliezer said</b> in a mishna (7a): There are <b>four women</b> with regard to whom the <i>halakha</i> is that their time is sufficient. This indicates that there are only four, <b>and no more.</b> Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us: All women,</b> to include all mentally competent women, not only the four mentioned by Rabbi Eliezer.",
            "The Gemara raises yet another difficulty against the opinion of Shammai: <b>But there is</b> the case of blood <b>stains.</b> The mishna teaches (66a) that a woman who finds a blood stain is impure retroactive to the last time she examined her clothing and found them clean. <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>we learned</b> the mishna with regard to <b>stains not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shammai? Abaye said: Shammai concedes</b> in the case <b>of stains.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason?</b> The reason is <b>that she neither engaged in</b> handling a slaughtered <b>bird nor</b> did <b>she pass through a marketplace of butchers.</b> If so, <b>from where</b> could <b>this blood</b> stain on her clothing have <b>come?</b> Since it must be from her last menstrual flow, Shammai agrees that she is impure retroactively.",
            "The Gemara suggests another analysis: <b>Or if you wish, say</b> that <b>this is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Shammai:</b> She is impure only from that point onward, <b>as, if it is so that there was</b> any menstrual <b>blood</b> previously, <b>it would have come</b> out <b>at the outset,</b> i.e., at the earlier time. The Gemara explains why Hillel maintains that there is ritual impurity retroactively, in light of this analysis: <b>And</b> as for <b>Hillel,</b> he holds that the <b>walls of the womb,</b> i.e., the walls of the vaginal canal, <b>held back</b> the menstrual blood from leaving the body entirely, and therefore there might have been a previous emission from the uterus into the vaginal canal that was not visible on the outside. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Shammai</b> respond to this claim? The Gemara answers: Shammai maintains that the <b>walls of the womb do not hold back blood.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to</b> a woman who <b>engages in intercourse</b> while using a contraceptive absorbent <b>cloth</b> in the form of a wad that she inserts in her vagina at the opening of her womb so as not to become pregnant, <b>what is there to say?</b> In other words, how does Shammai explain why there is no retroactive impurity status in such a case, as it cannot be claimed that any previous menstrual blood would have flowed out earlier. <b>Abaye says: Shammai concedes with regard to</b> a woman who <b>engages in intercourse</b> while using a contraceptive <b>cloth</b> that she is impure retroactively.",
            "<b>Rava says:</b> Here <b>as well,</b> in a case where a woman engages in intercourse while using a contraceptive absorbent <b>cloth,</b> any previous menstrual blood would have flowed out, as the absorbent cloth does not hermetically seal the womb. The reason is that the cloth <b>wrinkles due to perspiration,</b> leaving space for blood to pass through. The Gemara adds: <b>And</b> nevertheless <b>Rava concedes</b> to Abaye that Shammai agrees that she is retroactively impure in a case <b>where</b> a woman engages in intercourse while using a tightly <b>packed</b> absorbent <b>cloth.</b>",
            "§ The Gemara suggested that the reasoning for Shammai’s opinion is that the woman would have felt any previous menstrual flow, or that any prior menstrual blood would have flowed out previously. Yet, earlier the Gemara suggested that his reason was that the woman retains her presumptive status of ritual purity. With regard to the explanations given for the opinion of Shammai, the Gemara asks: <b>What</b> difference <b>is there between these versions and that version</b> suggested earlier?"
        ],

            "The Gemara answers: The difference <b>between</b> them is with regard to the possibility <b>of raising a contradiction</b> between Shammai’s ruling here and the cases of <b>a barrel, a ritual bath, and an alleyway. According to that version,</b> that Shammai’s reasoning is based upon the principle that an item retains its presumptive status, <b>there is</b> room <b>to raise these contradictions,</b> as the Gemara explained. By contrast, <b>according to these</b> other <b>versions,</b> that the woman would have felt any previous menstrual flow or that any prior menstrual blood would have flowed out previously, <b>there is no</b> room <b>to raise</b> such <b>contradictions,</b> as those rulings do not contradict the <i>halakha</i> here, where a unique factor is relevant.",
            "The Gemara further asks: <b>And what</b> difference <b>is there between this version,</b> that any prior menstrual blood would have flowed out, <b>and that version,</b> that she would have felt any previous menstrual flow? The Gemara answers: <b>According to Abaye,</b> who maintains that Shammai agrees that a woman who engages in intercourse while using a contraceptive cloth is impure retroactively, <b>there is</b> a difference in a case where the woman engages in intercourse while using a contraceptive <b>cloth.</b> If Shammai’s reasoning is that a woman senses the emission of blood, in this case too it is assumed that she did not emit blood earlier. By contrast, if his reasoning is that any prior menstrual blood would have come out at the outset, it is possible that the cloth blocked the emission of blood, and she already emitted blood. Consequently, she is impure retroactively.",
            "<b>According to Rava,</b> who maintains that blood can emerge even if the woman engages in intercourse while using a contraceptive absorbent cloth, <b>there is</b> a difference between the two interpretations in a case where she engages in intercourse while using a tightly <b>packed</b> absorbent <b>cloth,</b> as such a cloth will prevent the blood from flowing out, but it does not affect her ability to sense an emission.",
            "It is <b>taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 4:4) <b>in accordance with this version,</b> i.e., that Shammai’s reasoning is <b>that if it is so, that there was</b> menstrual <b>blood</b> previously, <b>it would have come</b> out <b>at the outset: Hillel said to Shammai: Don’t you concede</b> to the following <i>halakha</i>: In the case <b>of a basket</b> that <b>was used</b> as a container for <b>ritually pure</b> items, and those items were placed <b>in</b> one <b>corner, and</b> subsequently the carcass of <b>a creeping animal was found in a different corner</b> of the basket, the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that the</b> items <b>initially</b> considered <b>ritually pure</b> are now retroactively considered <b>impure? Shammai said to him: Indeed,</b> that is correct.",
            "Hillel continues: <b>And</b> if so, <b>what difference</b> is there between <b>this</b> case of the pure items stored in the basket, which are now considered retroactively impure, <b>and that</b> case of the ritually pure woman who experiences a menstrual flow, who is impure only from that point onward? Shammai answers: <b>This</b> one, the basket, <b>has a base</b> on which it rests, and therefore the creeping animal might have been there earlier unseen. <b>That one,</b> the menstruating woman, <b>has no base,</b> i.e., there is nothing to impede her menstrual blood from flowing out. Shammai’s response indicates that she is not retroactively impure because if she had experienced a previous menstruation it would have flowed at that stage.",
            "§ <b>Rava says:</b> The <b>reason for</b> the opinion of <b>Shammai</b> that a woman who experiences menstruation is not deemed ritually impure retroactively is <b>due to the dereliction of</b> the mitzva to <b>be fruitful and multiply.</b> If woman is always deemed retroactively impure, she and her husband might abstain from engaging in sexual intercourse out of fear that she is already impure even if she has not yet experienced bleeding. The Gemara adds <b>that this</b> explanation <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Shammai said to Hillel: If</b> it is <b>so,</b> that a woman is rendered retroactively impure as you claim, <b>you</b> will <b>have caused the Jewish women to be derelict in</b> the mitzva to <b>be fruitful and multiply.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to <b>the one who taught this version,</b> i.e., Rava, there is a difficulty: <b>Isn’t it taught in</b> the aforementioned mishna <b>in accordance with that</b> other <b>version,</b> that Shammai’s reasoning is <b>that if it is so, that there was</b> any menstrual <b>blood</b> previously, <b>it would have come</b> out <b>at the outset?</b> The Gemara answers: There, in that mishna, <b>it is Hillel who erred. He thought</b> the <b>reason</b> of <b>Shammai</b> is <b>that if it is so, that there was</b> any menstrual <b>blood</b> previously, <b>it would have come</b> out <b>at the outset. And</b> therefore, <b>he raises a difficulty</b> against Shammai’s opinion from the case of the <b>basket.</b>",
            "<b>And Shammai said to</b> Hillel: You are mistaken. <b>My reasoning</b> is actually <b>due to the dereliction of</b> the mitzva to <b>be fruitful and multiply. But even according to your erroneous</b> reasoning <b>that</b> led <b>you to raise a difficulty</b> from the case of the <b>basket,</b> I have an answer for that as well: <b>This</b> basket <b>has a base,</b> and therefore the creeping animal could have been there earlier, unseen; <b>but that</b> menstruating woman <b>has no base.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks the reverse question: <b>And according to the one</b> who <b>teaches this</b> other <b>version,</b> that Shammai’s reasoning is that if there was previous menstrual blood it would have come out at the outset, <b>isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with that</b> other <b>version,</b> that Shammai’s reasoning is <b>due to the dereliction of</b> the mitzva to <b>be fruitful and multiply?</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: That <i>baraita</i> was recorded at a later point in their discussion, as <b>this</b> is what <b>Hillel is saying to Shammai: Yes,</b> the <b>reason</b> that <b>you say</b> for your opinion has merit, <b>that if it is so, that there was</b> any menstrual <b>blood</b> previously, <b>it would have come</b> out <b>at the outset. Nevertheless,</b> you should <b>enact a safeguard for your statement</b> and render her retroactively impure, <b>as</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from the rest of the entire Torah, where</b> the Sages <b>enact safeguards?</b>",
            "Shammai <b>said to</b> Hillel: <b>If so,</b> i.e., if she is considered impure retroactively as a safeguard, <b>you</b> will <b>have caused the Jewish women to be derelict in</b> the mitzva to <b>be fruitful and multiply.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Hillel</b> respond to Shammai’s reasoning with regard to the mitzva to be fruitful and multiply? The Gemara explains that Hillel would answer: Although I rule that she is retroactively impure, <b>did I say</b> that she is forbidden to her husband and must therefore abstain <b>from</b> the mitzva to <b>be fruitful and multiply? I said</b> only <b>that</b> she renders impure any <b>ritually pure</b> items that she touched.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how would <b>Shammai</b> reply to this? The Gemara answers: Shammai maintains that <b>even</b> a safeguard that renders <b>ritually pure</b> items impure should <b>not</b> be imposed. The reason is <b>that if</b> it were <b>so,</b> the <b>heart</b> of a scrupulous husband might <b>strike him</b> with pangs of conscience over sins that he could transgress <b>and he</b> would <b>separate</b> from his wife, out of fear that she is impure.",
            "The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for the ensuing discussions: <b>A base; examined; covered; in a corner.</b> It <b>was stated:</b> If one has <b>a basket</b> that <b>was used</b> as a container for holding <b>ritually pure</b> produce, and those items were placed <b>in</b> one <b>corner</b> of the basket, <b>and</b> subsequently the carcass of <b>a creeping animal was found in a different corner</b> of the basket, <b>Ḥizkiyya says:</b> That produce <b>initially</b> considered <b>ritually pure</b> is still <b>pure. Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The produce <b>initially</b> considered <b>ritually pure</b> is now retroactively deemed <b>impure.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> how can Ḥizkiyya rule that it is pure? After all, don’t <b>Shammai and Hillel agree in</b> the case of the <b>basket that</b> the produce <b>initially</b> considered <b>pure</b> is now retroactively <b>impure?</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>When</b> do <b>Shammai and Hillel agree</b> that all the produce is retroactively impure? <b>With regard to a basket that has a base.</b> In such a case, the carcass of the creeping animal might have previously been in the basket and it went unnoticed when one removed the pure produce items. <b>When Ḥizkiyya and Rabbi Yoḥanan disagree,</b> it is <b>with regard to a basket that has no base,</b> i.e., both ends were open and the basket was used while it was lying on its side. In that situation, the contents of the basket are emptied by raising one end, which causes all items inside to fall out. Consequently, any creeping animal that was found subsequently must have entered the basket only after that produce was removed, which is why Ḥizkiyya rules that the produce remains pure.",
            "The Gemara asks: If this is referring to a case where the basket <b>has no base, what is the reasoning of Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> for ruling that the produce is ritually impure? The Gemara answers: The basket <b>has no base but it</b> does <b>have</b> an inward-curved <b>rim.</b> Therefore, it is possible that the carcass of a small creeping animal might have been held back by the rim and remained inside the basket even after it was turned over. Rabbi Yoḥanan rules that the produce is retroactively impure, due to the possibility that the creeping animal might have been in the basket previously together with the initially pure produce.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who draws ten pails of water one after another,</b> i.e., he draws out water in one pail and from it he fills another ten pails with water, <b>and</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal is found in one of them, that</b> pail of water <b>is ritually impure but all</b> the rest <b>of them</b> are <b>pure. And Reish Lakish says in the name of Rabbi Yannai:</b> This <i>halakha</i> was <b>taught only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the pail <b>has no</b> inward-curved <b>rim.</b> Consequently, its contents are entirely emptied each time it is overturned, which means that the creeping animal must have entered only this pail. <b>But</b> if the pail <b>has a rim, all of</b> the water that had been drawn is <b>impure,</b> as the creeping animal might have entered the pail earlier and the rim held it back each time the pail was overturned.",
            "The Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>Ḥizkiyya,</b> who is not concerned that the rim of the basket might have held back the creeping animal, does <b>not agree</b> with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yannai?</b> The Gemara answers that there is a difference between the two cases: <b>Water is slippery,</b> whereas <b>produce is not slippery.</b> In order to pour water out of the pail it is not necessary to turn it over completely. Therefore, the rim might hold back a creeping animal. By contrast, a basket must have one end fully raised in order to empty out all the produce it contains. In such a case Rabbi Yannai would agree that nothing could have been held back, and therefore the emptied produce remains pure.",
            "Alternatively, there is a different reason why one does not overturn a pail of water entirely: In the case of <b>water, one is not particular about it,</b> i.e., he does not mind if some is left over. Therefore he does not overturn the pail completely. By contrast, in the case of <b>produce one is particular about it,</b> so he raises one end of the basket entirely to ensure that every last piece of produce is emptied. Consequently, in the case of produce Rabbi Yannai would agree that even if the basket has a rim, all the produce remains pure.",
            "As an alternative to its previous resolution that Ḥizkiyya is discussing the case of a rimmed receptacle, the Gemara suggests another resolution of the apparent contradiction between Ḥizkiyya’s ruling and the opinions of Hillel and Shammai. <b>And if you wish, say: When</b> do <b>Shammai and Hillel agree? In</b> the case of <b>a basket that was not examined.</b> Since he did not examine the basket when he placed the pure produce there, a creeping animal might have already been inside. Consequently, they agree that the produce does not retain its presumptive state of purity but is considered retroactively impure."

            "<b>When Ḥizkiyya and Rabbi Yoḥanan disagree,</b> it is <b>with regard to a basket</b> that was <b>examined.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Ḥizkiyya, <b>holds</b> that <b>since</b> it <b>was examined</b> before the produce was placed inside and was found to be clean of creeping animals, it is reasonable to assume that the creeping animal entered only after the ritually pure produce was removed. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>holds</b> that one can <b>say</b> that it is possible that <b>when he removed his hand</b> after feeling around to examine the basket, the creeping animal <b>fell</b> in.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t</b> the case of a basket <b>taught</b> as being <b>similar to</b> the case of a menstruating <b>woman?</b> Hillel had cited the case of the basket as a difficulty with regard to Shammai’s opinion in the case of a menstruating woman. <b>And</b> since <b>a woman is</b> considered fully <b>examined,</b> since she examines herself with examination cloths twice a day, the other case must also be referring to a basket that had been examined.

Rabbi Yoḥanan is concerned that perhaps while the basket was uncovered a creeping animal could have fallen inside without one noticing.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: But <b>isn’t</b> the case of a basket <b>taught</b> as being <b>similar to</b> the case of a menstruating <b>woman?

Instead, it fell inside while the basket was in the second corner, and therefore the produce that it previously contained remains pure. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan holds:</b> The produce is retroactively considered impure, as <b>we</b> do <b>presume</b> that ritual impurity, i.e., the carcass of the creeping animal in the basket, moved from place to place.",
            "The Gemara asks a question with regard to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>And do we presume</b> that ritual impurity moved from place to place? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 5:7): If someone <b>touched one</b> other person <b>at night, and he does not know whether</b> the person he touched was <b>alive or dead, and on the following day he arose and found him dead,</b> and he is uncertain whether or not he contracted ritual impurity from contact with a corpse, <b>Rabbi Meir deems him</b> ritually <b>pure.</b> It is assumed that the deceased was still alive until the point that it is known with certainty that he was dead.",
            "<b>And the Rabbis deem him</b> ritually <b>impure, as</b> it is presumed that <b>all</b> ritually <b>impure</b> items had already been in the same state as they were <b>at the time they were discovered.</b> Just as the deceased was found dead in the morning, so too, it is presumed that he was dead when he was touched in the middle of the night.",
            "The Gemara concludes its question: <b>And it is taught with regard to</b> this mishna: It is presumed that ritually impure items had been in the same state as they were <b>at the time they were discovered, but</b> only <b>in the place</b> in which <b>they were discovered.</b> In other words, if the corpse had been found in a different spot than he was at night, it is not presumed that he was already dead in the first spot, and the man who touched him remains ritually pure. If so, how can Rabbi Yoḥanan maintain that we presume impurity moved from place to place?",
            "<b>And if you would say</b> in response: <b>This statement,</b> that impurity is presumed only in the place in which it was discovered, applies specifically with regard to definite impure status, i.e., <b>to burn</b> <i>teruma</i>, <b>but</b> with regard to uncertain impurity, i.e., <b>to suspend</b> the status of <i>teruma</i>, <b>we</b> do in fact <b>suspend</b> its status and it may be neither burned nor eaten; is this distinction correct? <b>Do we</b> in fact <b>suspend</b> the status of ritually pure items in such a case, due to the concern that the dead man whom this individual touched might have already been dead in the first location?",
            "<b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 3:5): With regard to a previously impure <b>needle that is found</b> on top of <i>teruma</i> and it is <b>full of rust or broken,</b> and therefore no longer contracts or transmit ritual impurity, the <i>teruma</i> remains <b>pure, as</b> it is presumed that in <b>all</b> cases of <b>impurity,</b> the items in question had already been in the same state as they were <b>at the time they were discovered? But why</b> should that be the case? <b>Let us say</b> that <b>initially,</b> when it had fallen onto the <i>teruma</i>, <b>this needle was a proper,</b> non-rusty and unbroken, <b>needle,</b> capable of contracting and transmitting ritual impurity, <b>and it is</b> only <b>now that rust</b> had <b>formed</b> on it. The status of the <i>teruma</i> should at least be held in suspension. Rather, it is evident that the <i>teruma</i> is considered definitely pure and is not held in suspension due to the possibility that it might have become impure from the nail at a previous time or, presumably, in a previous place.",
            "<b>And furthermore, we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 9:9): If one <b>found</b> the carcass of <b>a burned creeping animal on top of</b> a pile of <b>olives,</b> and that animal no longer transmits impurity as it is burned, <b>and similarly</b> if one finds <b>a tattered rag</b> of a <i>zav</i>, which likewise no longer transmits impurity, on top of a pile of olives, the olives are <b>pure.</b> The reason is <b>that</b> it is presumed in <b>all</b> cases of <b>impurity,</b> the items in question had already been in the same state as they were <b>at the time they were discovered.</b> Once again, this demonstrates that when this presumption is applied, the item is considered definitely pure, and is not held in suspension due to uncertainty.",
            "<b>And if you would say</b> that there is a difference between these last cases, where the items did not move, and the case of the basket that moved, this distinction is not correct. The suggestion is that in the last cases the items are treated entirely as if they had always been as they were <b>at the time they were discovered, whether</b> this leads <b>to a leniency,</b> as in the cases of the needle and the rag, <b>and whether</b> it leads <b>to a stringency,</b> in the case of one who touched someone at night, when he is considered to be definitely impure, <b>but</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> only with regard to the <b>place</b> where <b>they were discovered,</b> i.e., if they did not move. <b>But</b> with regard to a location that is <b>not the place</b> where <b>they were discovered,</b> we do suspect that ritual impurity moved from place to place, and therefore although <b>we do not burn</b> the <i>teruma</i> in question, <b>we hold it in suspension.</b>",
            "The Gemara refutes this suggestion: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Teharot</i> 4:3): There was <b>a loaf</b> resting <b>on top</b> of <b>a shelf, and</b> there was <b>an item of light impurity,</b> e.g., a garment of a <i>zav</i>, which transmits impurity to food but not to people or vessels, <b>lying underneath it,</b> and the loaf was later found on the ground. <b>Even though</b> the situation was such <b>that if</b> the loaf <b>fell</b> to the ground it would be <b>impossible</b> for it to have done anything <b>other than touch</b> the impure garment on its way down, nevertheless the loaf is <b>pure.</b> The reason is <b>that I say</b> that <b>a ritually pure man entered there and took it</b> off the shelf and placed it onto the ground without it touching the impure garment.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> concludes: This ruling applies <b>unless someone says: It is clear to me that no person entered</b> there. <b>And Rabbi Elazar says:</b> This principle is <b>necessary only when</b> the top shelf is <b>an inclined surface.</b> In other words, even if it is very likely that the loaf rolled off the shelf and touched the garment on its way down to the ground, nevertheless it is assumed to be pure. This indicates that one does not presume that the loaf contracted impurity and then fell to the ground where it was found. Since such a possibility is not even entertained to the extent that the <i>teruma</i> is held in suspension, this demonstrates that in a case involving a movement from one place to another there is no presumption of ritual impurity at all.",
            "The Gemara explains that no proof can be cited from <b>there, as</b> that <i>baraita</i> explicitly <b>teaches</b> the <b>reason</b> for its ruling:"
        ],
        [
            "The reason is not <b>that</b> one does not presume that ritual impurity moved from place to place, but because <b>I say</b> that <b>a ritually pure man entered there and took it</b> off the shelf and placed it onto the ground, avoiding the impure garment it would have hit had it fallen. When there is no such explanation, the principle that one presumes impurity moved from place to place does apply, e.g., in the case of the basket where the carcass of a creeping animal was found inside.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Here, too, let us say</b> that <b>a raven,</b> which often touches creeping animals, <b>came and threw</b> the creeping animal into the basket when it was in the second corner, after the produce had been emptied from it. The Gemara rejects this claim: In the case of <b>a person, who</b> acts <b>with intent, we</b> can <b>say</b> that perhaps a person moved the loaf from the shelf onto the ground. By contrast, with regard to <b>a raven, which</b> does <b>not</b> act <b>with intent, we</b> do <b>not say</b> that perhaps it committed such a purposeful act.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to the ruling of the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>Now</b> the status of <b>this loaf</b> found on the ground <b>is</b> one of <b>uncertain impurity</b> found <b>in a private domain, and</b> the guiding principle in <b>any</b> case of <b>uncertainty</b> involving <b>impurity in a private domain</b> is that the item with <b>uncertain</b> status is deemed <b>impure.</b> If so, shouldn’t the loaf be deemed impure? The Gemara answers: No, <b>as</b> this <b>is an entity that lacks consciousness</b> in order for it <b>to be asked, and</b> the guiding principle is that with regard to <b>any entity that lacks consciousness</b> in order for it <b>to be asked, whether</b> it is found <b>in a public domain or in a private domain,</b> the item with <b>uncertain</b> status is deemed <b>pure.</b>",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: That principle, that in any case of uncertainty involving impurity in a private domain the item with uncertain status is deemed impure, applies to a case of impurity by Torah law, whereas <b>here</b> we are dealing <b>with ritual impurity by rabbinic law.</b> The Gemara adds: The language of the <i>Tosefta</i> <b>is also precise, as it teaches:</b> There was a loaf resting on top of a shelf, and there was an item of light impurity [<i>madaf</i> ] lying underneath it. The term <b><i>madaf</i></b> is similar to that <b>which is written: “A driven leaf [<i>niddaf</i> ]”</b> (Leviticus 26:36), i.e., a light item.

The Gemara explains: <b>And Rabba</b> did not in fact mean this explanation seriously; rather, he <b>wanted to hone</b> the mind of <b>Abaye.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>what</b> is the real <b>reason</b> for the opinion <b>of the Rabbis?</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: It is <b>in accordance with that which Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel says: The Sages instituted that the Jewish women should examine themselves</b> twice each day, <b>morning and evening.</b> The <b>morning</b> examination is in order <b>to render fit</b> the <b>ritually pure</b> items <b>of the night,</b> i.e., any items that she touched the night before. <b>And</b> the <b>evening</b> examination is in order <b>to render fit</b> the <b>pure</b> items that she touched <b>during the day.</b>",
            "The Gemara continues its explanation: <b>And this</b> woman, <b>since she did not examine</b> herself in accordance with the rabbinic enactment, <b>she loses</b> the status of the ritually pure items she touched over the <b>period [<i>ona</i>]</b> of a day or a night. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is meant by: <b>Period</b> of a day or a night? Doesn’t her retroactive impurity status extend back for a twenty-four-hour period? The Gemara answers: It means <b>an additional period</b> of a day or a night, i.e., twenty-four hours in total.",
            "<b>Rav Pappa says to Rava: But</b> occasionally <b>you find three periods</b> of day or night within a twenty-four-hour period. For example, if she examined herself on Monday afternoon and finds blood, then the twenty-four-hour period extending back to Sunday afternoon includes three periods of day or night: Monday day, Sunday night and Sunday day from the time of her most recent examination, as these twenty-four hours do not fit precisely into two such periods. The Gemara answers: <b>The Sages rendered their measures equal, so</b> that <b>one should not differentiate</b> between cases. In other words, they wanted to issue a uniform ruling that applies universally <b>and</b> therefore they established a set twenty-four-hour <b>period</b> of retroactive impurity, regardless of the circumstances.",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that they established the set twenty-four-hour period <b>so that the sinner should not profit</b> from his transgression. If the extent of retroactive impurity would be fixed at one additional period of day or night, a woman who remembers and examines herself in the early morning would be impure retroactively for a full twenty-four hours, back to early morning the previous day, whereas one who waits until noon would be impure only for the period of the morning and the previous night.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the difference <b>between</b> these two answers? The Gemara answers: The difference <b>between</b> them is in a case <b>where she was prevented</b> by outside circumstances <b>and did not perform an examination.</b> According to the second answer she would not be considered a sinner and therefore she would be impure only for an additional period of a day or night. By contrast, according to the first answer her impure status would span twenty-four hours regardless of the circumstances.",
            "§ The mishna teaches: For <b>any woman who has a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle,</b> and she examined herself at that time and discovered blood, her time is sufficient, and she transmits impurity only from that time onward. The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Dosa, and not</b> in accordance with <b>the</b> opinion of <b>the Rabbis? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: There are four</b> categories of <b>women</b> for whom the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>their time is sufficient: A virgin,</b> i.e., a girl who has never experienced menstruation, <b>a pregnant woman, a nursing</b> mother, <b>and an elderly woman. Rabbi Dosa says:</b> For <b>every woman who has a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle,</b> and she examined herself at that time and discovered blood, <b>her time is sufficient,</b> and it is only from that stage that she transmits ritual impurity.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.

            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>By inference,</b> one can conclude <b>that Rabbi Dosa says</b> that her time is sufficient <b>even</b> if she discovers blood <b>not at the fixed time of her</b> menstrual <b>cycle.</b> If so, <b>who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>? <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a woman who has a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle</b> who finds a blood stain, <b>her</b> blood <b>stain</b> is <b>impure retroactively</b> from when the garment in question was laundered. The reason is <b>that if she sees</b> a flow of menstrual blood <b>not at the fixed time of her</b> menstrual <b>cycle,</b> it renders her impure retroactively <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period.</b> Therefore, the blood stain likewise renders her retroactively impure.",
            "The Gemara concludes its question: <b>Shall we say</b> that this <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis and not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Dosa?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Dosa,</b> as one can claim that <b>Rabbi Dosa disagrees with the Rabbis only</b> in a case where a woman sees menstrual blood <b>at the fixed time of her</b> menstrual <b>cycle.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>Since there is</b> a way <b>to interpret</b> it <b>as a leniency,</b> i.e., that all agree that blood discovered at the fixed time of menstruation renders items impure only from that point onward, <b>and</b> it can also be interpreted in a manner that leads <b>to a stringency,</b> i.e., everyone agrees that blood discovered not at her fixed time for menstruation causes retroactive impurity, and furthermore the Rabbis hold that this is the <i>halakha</i> even when blood is discovered at her fixed time of menstruation, <b>we interpret</b> it the way that leads <b>to a stringency.</b>",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is this? Granted, if you say</b> that the mishna is referring to <b>one</b> cloth used <b>before intercourse and one</b> used <b>after intercourse,</b> it <b>was necessary</b> for the mishna to mention both examinations, as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since she is excited</b> and hurried <b>for</b> intercourse with <b>her husband, she did not examine</b> herself <b>properly.</b> Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that her examination with a cloth before intercourse <b>is</b> considered <b>as</b> a halakhically valid <b>examination. But if you say</b> that <b>this</b> cloth <b>and that</b> cloth are his and her cloths used <b>after intercourse,</b> isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that they are treated as halakhic examinations? Why is this ruling necessary?",
            "The Gemara answers: The <i>halakha</i> that the examinations performed after intercourse count as valid examinations is necessary, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>perhaps</b> she might <b>see a drop of blood corresponding</b> to the size of <b>a mustard seed and</b> a drop of <b>semen covered it.</b> In other words, it is possible that she discharged a tiny amount of menstrual blood that went undetected, as it was covered by a drop of semen.

            "The Gemara provides another answer: <b>And now that Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> In a case of <b>uncertain ritual impurity that comes</b> about <b>by the hand of a person,</b> i.e., through his involvement, the owner of the vessel must <b>consult</b> a Sage <b>about it,</b> i.e., it is considered an entity that has consciousness in order for it to be asked, as in such a case <b>even with regard to a vessel that is placed upon the ground,</b> which is certainly incapable of providing an answer if asked, its halakhic status is <b>like</b> that of <b>an item that has consciousness</b> in order for it <b>to be asked.</b> With this statement in mind, one can explain that according to Ze’eiri a menstruating woman transmits impurity to a bed <b>even though her friends are not carrying her in the bed.</b> Rather, as the bed’s ritual impurity was caused by the hand of a person, it has the halakhic status of an item that has consciousness in order for it to be asked.",

            "The Gemara answers: <b>Except for that</b> one, i.e., do not raise a difficulty from that <i>baraita</i>, since it is referring to a specific case. <b>As Rav Hoshaya teaches</b> with regard to an item whose purity status is uncertain: When it is <b>in the private domain,</b> the item with <b>uncertain</b> status is deemed <b>impure;</b> when it is <b>in the public domain,</b> it is deemed <b>pure.</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring to an item located in the public domain.

But if</b> his proof had been merely <b>from the <i>baraita</i>, I would say</b> that a different <i>halakha</i> applies to a bed and chair than to the earthenware vessels, as the <i>baraita</i> means that the bed and chair render impure <b>a person or garments</b> that they touch, <b>but</b> they do <b>not</b> render <b>a person</b> impure to the extent that he then transmits impurity to his <b>garments.</b> It is <b>due to that</b> reason that Rava <b>says</b> the <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference.",
            "§ <b>Rav Huna says:</b> The twenty-four-hour <b>period</b> of retroactive impurity <b>of</b> a <b>menstruating woman</b> applies only <b>to sacrificial</b> food <b>but not to <i>teruma</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If so, let</b> the mishna in <i>Ḥagiga</i> 20b <b>teach</b> this <b>among</b> the other higher <b>levels</b> of purity that apply to sacrificial foods but not to <i>teruma</i>. That mishna lists stringencies of ritual purity that are in effect with regard to sacrificial foods and not <i>teruma</i>. The Gemara answers: <b>When</b> that mishna <b>teaches</b> those higher levels of purity, it is referring only to types of impurity <b>that have a connection [<i>derara</i>] to impurity</b> as defined by Torah law. <b>But</b> it <b>does not teach</b> a case <b>where there is no connection to impurity</b> as defined by Torah law, and the retroactive impurity of a menstruating woman is by rabbinic law.",
            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the aforementioned <i>baraita</i> that deals with the retroactive impurity of a menstruating woman: What does <b>she render impure</b> during that period? <b>Food and drink.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What, is it not</b> correct to say that this is referring <b>both to sacrificial</b> food <b>and to <i>teruma</i>? The</b> Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is referring only <b>to sacrificial</b> food, not to <i>teruma</i>.",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a mishna (11a): With regard to women of priestly families who must examine themselves before partaking of <i>teruma</i>, <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Even when they conclude partaking of <i>teruma</i>,</b> they still need to examine themselves. <b>And we discussed</b> this statement of Rabbi Yehuda and asked: Why do they need to examine themselves after they finish eating <i>teruma</i>? <b>What was, was;</b> i.e., if a woman was impure when she ate the <i>teruma</i>, what is achieved by an examination now?",
            "And <b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> in explanation: <b>It was necessary only</b> in order <b>to amend the</b> situation of the <b>remaining</b> <i>teruma</i> that is left <b>before her,</b> i.e., to prevent it from being rendered ritually impure. In other words, if she later experiences a flow of menstrual blood, her retroactive impurity status will not render the remaining <i>teruma</i> impure. This ruling apparently contradicts the opinion of Rav Huna, who said that the retroactive impurity of a menstruating woman affects only sacrificial foods, not <i>teruma</i>.",
            "The Gemara answers: According to <b>Rav Huna,</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>teaches</b> that since impure <i>teruma</i> must be burned, she must examine herself in order to determine whether it is correct <b>to burn</b> the <b>remaining</b> <i>teruma</i> that was <b>in her hands.</b> If she <b>examined herself</b> immediately after eating the <i>teruma</i>, in the <b>period of time</b> needed for the onset of <b>menstruation</b> (see 14b), and she found that she was impure, it is assumed as a certainty that she was impure when she ate the <i>teruma</i>. Consequently, the remaining <i>teruma</i> must be burned, in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> of <i>teruma</i> that was definitely rendered impure. But in fact, Rav Huna maintains that she does not render that remaining <i>teruma</i> impure retroactively, in a case where she did not examine herself.",
            "The Gemara further suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another difficulty with regard to the opinion of Rav Huna from a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident</b> in which <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>performed an action</b> by ruling that the <i>halakha</i> <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer.</b> Rabbi Eliezer maintains that a woman who passed three expected menstrual cycles without experiencing bleeding is presumed not to be menstruating any longer, and therefore any menstrual blood that she emits later renders her ritually impure only from then onward, but not retroactively. By contrast, the Rabbis contend that this <i>halakha</i> applies only to an older woman, for whom it is natural to stop menstruating, but not to a young woman, even if three typical periods have passed without bleeding.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>After</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>remembered</b> that Rabbi Eliezer’s colleagues disagree with Rabbi Eliezer on this matter and that he had apparently ruled incorrectly, <b>he</b> nevertheless <b>said: Rabbi Eliezer is worthy [<i>kedai</i>] to rely upon</b>"

            "The Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that the case involved <b>loaves of <i>teruma</i></b> bread.

It means <b><i>teruma</i> of the loaves of the thanks offering,</b> i.e., the four loaves of the thanks offering that were separated from the total of forty and eaten by the priests. These are sacrificial foods, not <i>teruma</i>. The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to this interpretation: <b>What</b> was she <b>doing baking the <i>teruma</i> of the loaves of the thanks offering</b> alone? All forty loaves of the thanks offering are baked together, and only afterward are four set aside as <i>teruma</i> to be eaten by priests.",
            "The Gemara answers: This is referring to a case <b>where</b> dough for the <i>teruma</i> loaves <b>was separated</b> and designated for the priests <b>during its kneading.

The Gemara answers: One must bake forty loaves in order <b>to</b> fulfill the <b>mitzva</b> in the optimal fashion, but he has nevertheless fulfilled his obligation with four loaves, one of each type.",
            "The Gemara continues its answer by further elucidating the statement of Rav Tovi bar Rav Ketina. And we asked with regard to this opinion: <b>But he is required to separate <i>teruma</i> from it,</b> i.e., to designate one loaf from each type that is given to the priests. <b>And if you would say that he separates a slice from each one</b> of the four loaves and gives them to the priest, this cannot be the case, as <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: “And of it he shall present <b>one</b> out of each offering for a gift to the Lord; it shall be the priest’s” (Leviticus 7:14). The word “one” indicates <b>that he may not take a slice,</b> but rather he takes a complete loaf. The Gemara answers: Rather, <b>we</b> must <b>say</b> that he <b>separated</b> dough for the <i>teruma</i> loaves <b>during its kneading. Here too, in</b> the incident involving Rabban Gamliel’s maidservant, she <b>separated</b> the dough <b>during its kneading.</b>",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>another incident involving the maidservant of Rabban Gamliel who was sealing barrels of wine.

            "<b>Some say another version</b> of Rav Huna’s statement. <b>Rav Huna says:</b> During the twenty-four-hour <b>period of</b> retroactive impurity of <b>a menstruating woman,</b> she <b>renders impure</b> both <b>sacrificial</b> food and <b><i>teruma</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is this derived? The Gemara answers: It can be inferred <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the mishna in <i>Ḥagiga</i> (20b) <b>does not teach</b> this matter <b>among</b> the other matters where higher <b>levels</b> of purity are required only for sacrificial foods but not for <i>teruma</i>. <b>Rav Naḥman said to</b> Rav Huna: <b>But doesn’t</b> the <b><i>tanna</i></b> explicitly <b>teach</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The retroactive impurity of a menstruating woman applies only <b>with regard to sacrificial</b> food but <b>not with regard to <i>teruma</i>?</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak received</b> the following explanation <b>from</b> Rav Naḥman: The <i>baraita</i> means that this retroactive impurity applies <b>to non-sacred</b> food <b>that was prepared according to</b> the standards of <b>purity of sacrificial</b> food, <b>but not to non-sacred</b> food <b>that was prepared</b> according to the standards of <b>purity of <i>teruma</i>.</b> It does apply to <i>teruma</i> itself.",
            "§ With regard to a non-sacred food prepared according to the standards of purity of <i>teruma</i>, <b>we learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Ḥalla</i> 3:2): In a case of dough where <b>uncertainty developed</b> as to whether it was <b>ritually impure,</b> if the uncertainty developed <b>before it was kneaded, it may be prepared</b> even <b>in</b> definite <b>impurity,</b> i.e., with impure vessels. If it developed <b>after it was kneaded, it</b> must <b>be prepared in purity.</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> elaborates: <b>Before it was kneaded it may be prepared</b> even <b>in</b> definite <b>impurity</b> because <b>it is non-sacred</b> food, <b>and</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that it is <b>permitted to cause impurity to non-sacred food in Eretz Yisrael. After it was kneaded it</b> must <b>be prepared in purity,</b> since <b>non-sacred</b> food <b>that is untithed with regard to</b> the obligation to separate <b><i>ḥalla</i>,</b> i.e., its <i>ḥalla</i> has not yet been separated, <b>is considered like <i>ḥalla</i>, and</b> it is <b>prohibited to cause impurity to <i>ḥalla</i>.</b>",
            "It is <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>:"
        ],
        [
            "<b>And</b> as the <b><i>ḥalla</i></b> of this kneaded, untithed dough is in a state of uncertain purity, its status is <b>suspended:</b> It is <b>neither eaten</b> like ritually pure <i>ḥalla</i>, <b>nor</b> is it <b>burned</b> like impure <i>ḥalla</i>. <b>With regard to which</b> uncertainty did <b>they state</b> this <i>halakha</i>? <b>With regard to <i>ḥalla</i></b> of <b>uncertain</b> status. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the concept of <b><i>ḥalla</i></b> of <b>uncertain</b> status? This apparently indicates a scenario of possible ritual impurity that applies specifically to <i>ḥalla</i>, not to non-sacred food.",
            "<b>Abaye and Rava both say: One should not say</b> that <b>we learned</b> this case of <i>ḥalla</i> of uncertain status among the cases of equal <b>proofs,</b> i.e., an unresolvable uncertainty, <b>such as</b> the case of <b>two paths,</b> where someone walked down one of two paths, one of which was ritually impure and the other ritually pure, and he does not remember which one he walked down. <b>As there,</b> even <b>regular non-sacred</b> food is <b>also rendered</b> ritually <b>impure</b> due to uncertainty.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the uncertainty referred to here is similar to the less likely case <b>of leaning, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Zavim</i> 3:2): In a case of <b>a <i>zav</i> and a ritually pure</b> person <b>who were unloading</b> a package <b>from a donkey or</b> who were <b>loading</b> a package onto a donkey, <b>when their package</b> is <b>heavy</b> the pure person is rendered <b>impure,</b> as perhaps the <i>zav</i> leaned on him while they handled the package together. If <b>their package</b> is <b>light,</b> he remains <b>pure. And</b> in <b>all those</b> cases, he remains ritually <b>pure</b> even if he is one of the <b>members of a synagogue</b> whose congregants handle non-sacred food according to the standards of sacrificial food, as this is not a true case of a <i>zav</i> moving a pure person. <b>But</b> he is <b>impure with regard to</b> matters involving <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> by rabbinic law.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And is non-sacred</b> food <b>that is untithed with regard to</b> the obligation to separate <b><i>ḥalla</i></b> really <b>considered like <i>ḥalla</i></b> to the extent that it is rendered impure even in a case of leaning? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a woman who immersed that day</b> and is waiting for nightfall for the purification process to be completed, she may separate <i>ḥalla</i>: <b>She may knead the dough, and separate its <i>ḥalla</i> from it, and place</b> the separated dough <b>into a wicker basket or a wooden board [<i>be’anḥuta</i>], and</b> subsequently she may <b>bring</b> it <b>near</b> the rest of the dough, <b>and</b> she may then <b>designate it</b> <i>ḥalla</i> <b>by name.</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: The reason that this is allowed, despite her impurity, is <b>because</b> the dough <b>is</b> impure by <b>third</b>-degree ritual impurity, <b>and</b> an item that has <b>third</b>-degree impurity is considered <b>pure with regard to non-sacred</b> food. The Gemara concludes its question: <b>And if you say</b> that <b>non-sacred</b> food <b>that is untithed with regard to</b> the obligation to separate <b><i>ḥalla</i></b> is <b>considered like <i>ḥalla</i>,</b> then she should <b>render it impure</b> with her touch, just as she would render actual <i>ḥalla</i> impure.",
            "<b>Abaye says:</b> With regard to <b>any</b> item <b>that</b> when it is <b>definitely</b> impure <b>renders non-sacred</b> food <b>impure,</b> as in the case of the <i>zav</i>, the Sages <b>issued a decree</b> that <b>its uncertain</b> impurity should also render non-sacred food items impure, <b>due to</b> its status as <b>non-sacred</b> food <b>that is untithed with regard to <i>ḥalla</i>. But</b> with regard to <b>this</b> case of <b>one who immersed that day, since</b> even when she is <b>definitely</b> impure she <b>does not render non-sacred food impure, they did not issue a decree</b> that she should render that dough impure <b>due to</b> its status as <b>non-sacred</b> food <b>that is untithed with regard to <i>ḥalla</i>.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> what about the twenty-four-hour <b>period</b> of retroactive impurity <b>of a menstruating woman? As a definitely</b> impure menstruating woman <b>renders non-sacred</b> food <b>impure and</b> nevertheless with regard to untithed dough the Sages <b>did not issue a decree</b> to treat <b>her uncertain</b> impurity as definite impurity <b>due to</b> the dough’s status as <b>non-sacred</b> food <b>that is untithed with regard to <i>ḥalla</i>.</b>",
            "The Gemara cites its source for this claim: <b>As the Master said: Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak received</b> from Rav Naḥman: The retroactive impurity of a menstruating woman transmits impurity <b>to non-sacred</b> food items <b>that were prepared according to</b> the standards of <b>purity of sacrificial</b> food, <b>but not to non-sacred</b> food items <b>that were prepared</b> according to the standards of <b>purity of <i>teruma</i>.</b> It is assumed that the level of purity required for non-sacred food items prepared according to the standards required of <i>teruma</i> is the same as that of dough from which <i>ḥalla</i> has not been separated, i.e., it is not treated as real <i>ḥalla</i>, which is rendered impure by her retroactive twenty-four-hour period of impurity.",
            "The Gemara answers: The level of purity required for non-sacred food items that were prepared according to the standards of purity of <i>teruma</i> is actually lower than the level required for dough from which <i>ḥalla</i> has not been separated. The reason is that <b>there,</b> in the case of non-sacred food items, there is <b>no</b> actual <b><i>teruma</i> mixed in it.</b> By contrast, <b>here,</b> in the case of untithed dough, there is <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> i.e., <i>ḥalla</i>, <b>mixed in it,</b> which will eventually be separated from this dough.",
            "<b>If you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Leave</b> aside the twenty-four-hour <b>period</b> of retroactive impurity of a menstruating woman, as it applies <b>by rabbinic law.</b> One cannot raise a difficulty against the principle that untithed dough is treated with the same level of purity as <i>ḥalla</i> from the case of the retroactive impurity of a menstruating woman, since that retroactive impurity is a rabbinic decree, and therefore there is more room for leniency.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> Unlike the women with regard to whom it was taught that they transmit impurity retroactively, there are <b>four women</b> who discern menstrual blood and <b>their time is sufficient,</b> i.e., they transmit impurity only from the moment that they saw the blood: <b>A virgin, a pregnant woman, a nursing woman, and an elderly woman.

It is <b>any</b> woman <b>who has not seen</b> the flow of menstrual <b>blood in all her days, even if she was married</b> and has experienced bleeding as a result of intercourse consummating her marriage. The time of <b>a pregnant woman</b> is <b>from</b> the point in her pregnancy when the existence of <b>her fetus is known</b> to all who see her.

            "The mishna continues: <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> Since any impure discharge that they might have experienced in between the first and seventh days would negate their count and require them to restart the seven-day period, the <i>zav</i> and the <i>zava</i> <b>have</b> counted <b>only the seventh day,</b> and must count another six days to complete the tally. And with regard to this dispute, it <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Yosei say: The statement of Rabbi Eliezer appears</b> more correct <b>than the statement of Rabbi Yehoshua, and the statement of Rabbi Akiva</b> appears more correct <b>than the statement of all of them. But</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer.</b>",
            "<b>And the other</b> case in which the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 8:7): With regard to <b>the exterior of vessels that contracted ritual impurity</b> through contact <b>with</b> impure <b>liquids,</b> i.e., with liquids that had touched the carcass of a creeping animal, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says,</b> with regard to this impurity that applies by rabbinic law: These exteriors <b>transmit impurity to liquids</b> that come in contact with them, but <b>they do not disqualify foods</b> with which they come into contact. The mishna elaborates: <b>They transmit impurity to</b> other <b>liquids, and even non-sacred</b> liquids. <b>And they do not disqualify foods, and even <i>teruma</i>. Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> These exteriors <b>transmit impurity to liquids and they disqualify</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>foods,</b> as well.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> I derived my ruling via <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference from the <i>halakha</i> of one who was ritually impure, who immersed that day and is waiting for nightfall for the purification process to be completed. <b>And if one who immersed that day, who</b> has second-degree ritual impurity status and therefore he <b>does not transmit impurity to non-sacred liquids,</b> nevertheless <b>disqualifies <i>teruma</i> foods</b> with which he comes into contact, then with regard to the <b>exteriors of vessels, which</b> do <b>transmit impurity to non-sacred liquids, is it not logical that</b> they should <b>render <i>teruma</i> food disqualified?</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Eliezer,</b> how does he refute this inference? The Gemara answers: He would counter that the <i>halakha</i> that the <b>exterior of vessels</b> are rendered impure through contact with impure foods or liquids is <b>by rabbinic law, and</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>one who immersed that day</b> apply <b>by Torah law. And</b> there is a principle that one does not <b>apply <i>a fortiori</i></b> inferences to derive conclusions <b>by rabbinic law from</b> cases that apply <b>by Torah law. As by Torah law</b> impure <b>foods do not transmit impurity to vessels, and</b> similarly, impure <b>liquids do not transmit impurity to vessels.</b>",
            "The Gemara continues: <b>And</b> it was <b>the Sages who issued a decree</b> that the exterior of a vessel is rendered impure when it comes into contact with impure liquids, and they decreed that only liquids, not foods, are rendered impure when they come into contact with impure vessel exteriors. The reason for this is <b>due to</b> the <b>liquids</b> secreted <b>by a <i>zav</i> or <i>zava</i>,</b> e.g., their saliva and urine, which have a primary degree of ritual impurity and therefore transmit impurity to vessels. Consequently, with regard to <b>liquids, which are apt to contract impurity, the Sages issued a decree that they</b> contract impurity when they come in contact with these impure vessel exteriors. But with regard to <b>foods, which are not</b> as <b>apt to contract impurity,</b> as they must first be rendered susceptible to impurity through contact with a liquid, <b>the Sages did not issue</b> such <b>a decree with regard to them.</b>",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: Rabbi Eliezer agrees that if the interior of a vessel is rendered impure by contact with impure liquids, it renders impure any <i>teruma</i> foods that come into contact with it. <b>But what is different</b> about the <b>exterior of vessels, that</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>cited</b> them as having a more lenient status? The Gemara answers: This is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> their <i>halakhot</i> are more <b>lenient</b> than those of the other parts of the vessel. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 25:6): With regard to <b>a vessel whose exterior was rendered impure by</b> contact with impure <b>liquids,</b> its <b>exterior is impure,</b> while its others parts, such as <b>its interior, its ear,</b> i.e., its looped handle, <b>its rim,</b> the edge of the vessel that protrudes outward, and <b>its handles, are pure.</b> But if its <b>interior was rendered impure, it is all impure.</b>",
            "These are the four cases with regard to which Shmuel said that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer. The Gemara asks: <b>What is Shmuel teaching us? In all</b> of these cases <b>we learned</b> explicitly that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer.",
            "<b>And if you would say</b> that he is <b>teaching us</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>exterior of vessels, whose</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>we did not learn</b> from the mishna, <b>let</b> Shmuel simply <b>state</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer with regard to</b> the <b>exterior of vessels.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Rather, this</b> is what Shmuel <b>teaches us: That</b> a final <b><i>halakha</i> may not be learned</b> directly <b>from the Talmud,</b> i.e., from a statement of a mishna or <i>baraita</i> that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with a specific opinion, unless the ruling is confirmed by <i>amora’im</i>.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And is there nothing more</b> that can be added to the list of cases in which the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer? <b>But isn’t there</b> another case <b>that we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Yevamot</i> 109a): Two brothers married two sisters, one an adult and the other a minor. If the husband of the adult dies, the Torah obligation of levirate marriage applies to the other brother, which is not abrogated by the rabbinic prohibition of the <i>yevama</i> as the sister of his minor wife. In such a case, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>We instruct the minor,</b> i.e., the surviving brother’s wife, <b>to refuse</b> to continue to stay married to <b>him</b> so that her marriage is dissolved, and he may then enter into levirate marriage with her adult sister, the widow of his childless brother. <b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>When Shmuel says</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer in four</b> cases, what he meant was four cases <b>within <i>Seder Teharot</i></b> in the Mishna, the order that deals with ritual purity. <b>But in the other orders, there are many</b> instances where the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer.",
            "The Gemara adds: <b>This too stands to reason, as we learned</b> in a mishna in the order of <i>Zera’im</i> (<i>Ḥalla</i> 2:4) that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Even</b> with regard to <b>one who removes</b> loaves of bread from an oven <b>and places them in a basket, the basket</b> serves to <b>combine them to</b> reach the quantity from which one is required to separate <b><i>ḥalla</i>,</b> despite the fact that each of the loaves does not contain the necessary measure for <i>ḥalla</i> on its own. <b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer. Conclude from this</b> that Shmuel’s general statement applies only to <i>Seder Teharot</i>.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: The case of <i>ḥalla</i> was cited as proof that there is an exception to Shmuel’s principle that there are only four cases where the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, after a difficulty was raised from the case of levirate marriage with the sister of one’s minor wife. <b>But</b> in <b>what</b> way is <b>this</b> case of <i>ḥalla</i> <b>greater</b> proof <b>than that</b> case of the levirate marriage? Neither case appears in <i>Seder Teharot</i>. The Gemara answers: The case of the levirate marriage is different, <b>as</b> there <b>Rabbi Elazar holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer.",
            "<b>As we learned</b> in the mishna (<i>Yevamot</i> 111b): A <i>yavam</i> may perform levirate marriage with only one of his deceased brother’s wives. Once he does so, the other wives are forbidden to him, because they had been married to his brother. If a deceased brother had two wives, an adult and a minor, and the <i>yavam</i> engaged in sexual intercourse with the minor and then engaged in intercourse with the adult, the Rabbis maintain that he disqualifies the minor from staying married to him, as her levirate bond is uncertain, and the adult wife is also prohibited to him, because the levirate marriage with the minor is considered effective by rabbinic law. <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The court <b>instructs the minor to refuse him,</b> thereby annulling her marriage retroactively, and he may then perform levirate marriage with the adult. Accordingly, the case of <i>ḥalla</i> is a stronger example, as there the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer exclusively, as his opinion is not supported by another <i>tanna</i>.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And does</b> Rabbi Elazar in fact <b>hold</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer? <b>But doesn’t</b> the Gemara (<i>Yevamot</i> 111b) explain that both the opinions of Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Elazar <b>are necessary,</b> as they apply to different cases, <b>and</b> therefore <b>they are not comparable to each other?</b> The Gemara suggests a new answer: <b>Rather,</b> the ruling with regard to levirate marriage is a weaker example of a case where the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer <b>because Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava holds in accordance with his opinion.</b>",
            "<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava testified</b> about <b>five matters of</b> <i>halakha</i>: Normally, marriage refusals of girls married off by their mother or brothers are discouraged. Yet, in specific instances where it is clear that if the marriage were to remain in effect it would engender problems related to levirate marriage and <i>ḥalitza</i>, the court <b>persuades minor girls to refuse</b> to continue living with their husbands, thereby resolving the complications involved in the case.",
            "<b>And</b> he also testified <b>that one may</b> allow <b>a woman</b> who seeks to remarry after hearing of her husband’s death <b>to marry based on</b> the testimony of <b>one witness,</b> as opposed to the two witnesses required for other matters of testimony. <b>And</b> he further testified <b>that a rooster was stoned</b> to death <b>in Jerusalem for killing a person,</b> in order to teach that the Torah law requiring the stoning of an ox that killed a person (see Exodus 21:28) applies to other animals as well. <b>And</b> he testified <b>about forty-day-old wine that was</b> used for <b>libation on the altar. And</b> finally, he testified <b>about</b> the <b>daily morning offering that was sacrificed at four hours</b> of the day.",
            "The Gemara concludes its proof: When the <i>baraita</i> teaches that Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava testified that the court persuades minor girls to refuse to continue living with their husbands, <b>what</b> is the significance of the reference to <b>minor girls</b> in the plural? Is this <b>not</b> referring to the <b>one</b> minor girl who is the subject of the ruling <b>of Rabbi Elazar and</b> the other <b>one</b> that is the subject of the ruling <b>of Rabbi Eliezer?</b> Apparently, Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer in the case of the minor’s refusal. If so, this ruling is a weaker proof that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer in cases outside of <i>Seder Teharot</i>. The Gemara answers: <b>No, what</b> is meant by the plural: <b>Minor girls?</b> It means <b>minor girls in general,</b> i.e., all minor girls in such cases where the ruling of Rabbi Elazar applies.",
            "The Gemara challenges: <b>If so, with regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i> listed in the <i>baraita</i> that one may allow <b>a woman</b> to marry based on the testimony of one witness, <b>let it also teach: Women,</b> in the plural, <b>and we will say</b> that it is referring to <b>women in general. Rather, from</b> the fact that <b>here</b> it <b>teaches: A woman, and</b> yet <b>here</b> it <b>teaches: Minor girls, conclude from</b> this discrepancy that Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava <b>is teaching</b> his ruling <b>specifically</b> about two minor girls: The one who is the subject of Rabbi Elazar’s ruling and the one who is the subject of Rabbi Eliezer’s ruling. The Gemara comments: Indeed, <b>conclude from it</b> that Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer.",
            "§ <b>And similarly, Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer in four</b> cases.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But that</b> case, where the <i>amora</i> Rabbi Elazar said that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer with regard to persuading a minor to refuse to stay married to her husband, is <b>difficult.</b> This apparently conflicts with the statement that there are only four cases in which Rabbi Elazar rules in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer.

            "Finally, <b>a virgin sycamore</b> is a sycamore for <b>as long as it has not been felled,</b> i.e., cut to promote growth. <b>The relevance</b> of this designation is <b>with regard to buying and selling.</b> If one stipulates that he is buying virgin sycamore, it is defined as one that has never been felled. <b>Alternatively,</b> the relevance is <b>with regard to</b> the prohibition against <b>felling it in the Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna: (<i>Shevi’it</i> 4:5): <b>One may not fell a virgin sycamore in the Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>because it is</b> considered <b>work,</b> as this promotes the growth of the tree.

Although the verse indicates that a fetus is known to all after three months, it is possible that this applies only to a nine-month pregnancy.

            "Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: You learned</b> the answer to your dilemma from a mishna (39a): <b>Rabbi Meir says: If</b> a woman <b>was in hiding</b> from danger, <b>and the time of her</b> fixed menstrual <b>cycle came and she did not examine</b> herself, nevertheless she is <b>ritually pure, as</b> it may be assumed that she did not experience bleeding because <b>fear dispels</b> the flow of menstrual <b>blood.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan explains the proof: The <b>reason</b> she is pure is <b>that there is fear,</b> from which it may be inferred that in a case where <b>there is no fear and the time of her</b> fixed menstrual <b>cycle arrived and she did not examine</b> herself, she would be <b>impure.</b>",
            "Rabbi Yoḥanan concludes: <b>Evidently,</b> from the fact that Rabbi Meir rules that a woman is impure if the time of her period passed without a proper examination, he maintains that the obligation for a woman to perform an examination at the time of her fixed menstrual <b>cycle</b> applies <b>by Torah law. And,</b> nevertheless, <b>since there is fear, her blood has stopped and</b> she is <b>not required</b> to perform <b>an examination.

By contrast, <b>according to the statement of Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon, her limbs become dislocated and her spirit,</b> i.e., her full strength and her regular menstrual cycle, <b>does not return</b> to her <b>until twenty-four months</b> have passed.",

Since his reasoning is that the menstrual blood of a nursing woman spoils and becomes milk, it is obvious that this applies as long as she continues to nurse him. The Gemara answers: This statement is indeed extraneous. It merely serves to form a parallel between the statement of Rabbi Meir and that of the other Sages. In other words, it was appended <b>due to</b> the statement: <b>Therefore,</b> if she was nursing him for four or five years, then after the first twenty-four months have passed, she transmits ritual impurity retroactively for a twenty-four-hour period or from examination to examination, which is referring to the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei.</b>",

Therefore, the additional clause <b>teaches us</b> that Rabbi Yosei maintains that the reason is only that her limbs become dislocated, and consequently she transmits retroactive impurity after twenty-four months.",

In other words, is it not true that the One, i.e., God, can bring a pure thing, such as milk, out of an impure thing, such as menstrual blood?",

            "<b>And Rabbi Elazar says:</b> Those Sages maintain that this verse is referring to <b>the water of sprinkling,</b> i.e., the purification water mixed with the ashes of the red heifer. <b>As</b> the individual who <b>sprinkles</b> the water and the one <b>upon whom</b> the water is <b>sprinkled</b> are both <b>pure, and</b> yet one who <b>touches</b> the purification water is rendered <b>impure.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is</b> the <b>one who sprinkles</b> the water actually <b>pure?

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But it is written: “He who sprinkles,” and it is written</b> in the same verse: “And <b>he who touches.”</b> How can these two terms be referring to the same individual? <b>And furthermore,</b> that verse states that <b>one who sprinkles requires</b> the <b>washing</b> of his <b>clothes,</b> indicating a severe level of impurity, whereas <b>one who touches does not require</b> the <b>washing</b> of his <b>clothes.</b> Evidently, the phrase “he who sprinkles” is not referring to one who touches. <b>Rather,</b> the Gemara explains: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>“He who sprinkles”?</b> This is referring to <b>one who carries</b> the purification waters.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>let</b> the Torah <b>write</b> explicitly: <b>One who carries.</b> Why does it state “he who sprinkles” when it is referring to carrying? The Gemara answers: The use of the term sprinkling in reference to carrying <b>teaches us</b> that one becomes impure <b>only by carrying</b> the <b>measure</b> required for <b>sprinkling.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who said</b> that <b>sprinkling requires</b> a minimum <b>measure</b> of water. <b>But according to the one who said</b> that <b>sprinkling does not require</b> a minimum <b>measure</b> of water, <b>what can be said?</b> According to this opinion, there is apparently no concept of a measure required for sprinkling.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Even according to the one who said</b> that <b>sprinkling does not require</b> a minimum <b>measure</b> of water, <b>that statement</b> applies only to the measure of purification water that must be sprinkled <b>onto the back,</b> i.e., onto the body, <b>of</b> the impure <b>man.</b> In this regard, any amount will suffice. <b>But with regard to the vessel</b> into which one dips the hyssop in order to sprinkle the water, it <b>requires</b> a certain <b>measure</b> of water. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Para</i> 12:5): <b>How much</b> water must <b>be in</b> the vessel so that it <b>will be enough for sprinkling?</b> It must be <b>enough to dip the tops of the stems</b> of the hyssop branch, used in the rite of purification, into the water <b>and sprinkle</b> it.",
            "The Gemara concludes the discussion of the purification waters with the following observation: <b>And that is</b> the meaning of that <b>which</b> King <b>Solomon said: “I said I would become wise, but it eludes me”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:23). According to tradition, even Solomon in his great wisdom could not understand the contradictory nature of the sprinkling of purification water, as it renders an impure person pure, and a pure person impure.",

            "<b>But</b> if she <b>stopped seeing</b> blood <b>due to intercourse, and</b> she subsequently <b>sees</b> blood at a different time, that sighting renders her <b>impure.</b> Similarly, if <b>one night passed without</b> her engaging in <b>intercourse and</b> then <b>she saw</b> blood without connection to intercourse, she is deemed <b>impure.</b> Furthermore, if she sees blood and the <b>appearance</b> of <b>her blood</b> had changed from her initial blood from her torn hymen, she is <b>impure.</b>",

Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>said to him: If so, you too render</b> this blood found on the cloth in the box <b>a stain,</b> which renders one impure as a matter of uncertainty. If you had considered it definitely impure, there would have been no distinction between a small stain and a large one.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who deems the woman definitely impure in this case, <b>maintains</b> that although <b>we require</b> that the size of the blood stain be <b>more than</b> the size of <b>a split bean,</b> this is necessary only <b>to exclude</b> the possibility that this is <b>the blood of a louse; and since</b> the possibility that it is <b>the blood of a louse has been excluded,</b> as its size is more than that of a split bean, <b>it certainly came from her body,</b> and therefore she is definitely impure.",
            "The Gemara analyzes this statement of Rabbi Ḥiyya with reference to the dilemma under discussion: <b>What, is it not</b> correct to assume that Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>was in his old age</b> when he disagreed with his teacher, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi?

            "§ The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi would <b>praise Rabbi Ḥama bar Bisa to Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei,</b> by saying <b>that he is a great man.</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: <b>When he comes to you, bring him to me.</b>",

            "The Gemara explains: <b>And Rabbi Ḥama bar Bisa</b> did so because he <b>maintains</b> that the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi is preferable, as <b>he is the head of the yeshiva, and the Sages are frequently in his presence, and</b> due to the constant disputes <b>his statements are sharper</b> than those of Rabbi Yosei, despite the fact that Rabbi Yosei was his teacher.",

            "The Gemara answers: The <i>tanna</i> of our mishna holds that one is not liable to bring a provisional guilt offering in every case involving the uncertain violation of a prohibition that, were it certain, would render one liable to bring a sin offering. Rather, <b>we require</b> it to be a case akin to that of one <b>piece from two pieces,</b> e.g., one had two pieces of meat before him, one of which was definitely forbidden while the other was permitted, and he does not know for certain which he ate. But when the uncertainty involves a single item, which may or may not have been forbidden, one does not bring a provisional guilt offering. In the case discussed in the mishna there is only one woman, as it is uncertain whether or not engaging in intercourse with her was permitted, which depends on whether menstruation began before or after intercourse.",

            "Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok, <b>said to them: This</b> is how <b>the Sages of Yavne explained</b> it: As long as the woman <b>did not wait</b> before examining herself after intercourse for a period of time <b>equivalent to</b> the time in <b>which she may descend from the bed and rinse her face, this is</b> considered <b>within</b> the period of <b>time</b> referred to in the mishna as: After time passed. <b>And</b> if blood is found on the cloth she used to examine herself during this period, they are both <b>impure</b> for seven days <b>due to uncertainty, and they are exempt from</b> bringing a sin <b>offering,</b> as this offering is brought only for an unwitting sin that was definitely committed. <b>But they are</b> each <b>obligated to</b> bring <b>a provisional guilt offering.</b>",
            "If <b>she waited</b> before examining herself after intercourse for a period of time <b>equivalent to</b> the time in <b>which she may descend from the bed and rinse her face, this is</b> considered: <b>After time,</b> i.e., after the time frame referred to in the mishna as: After time passed.",

Therefore, if he is a priest <b>he may enter the Sanctuary and burn incense.</b>",
            "The Gemara explains the difficulty with Rav Ashi’s interpretation of the mishna according to this <i>baraita</i>: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ḥisda,</b> who maintains that the period of: After time passed, during which if the woman found blood on her cloth the man with whom she engaged in intercourse is rendered impure for seven days, is equivalent to the time it takes for her to extend her hand and examine herself, <b>this is</b> the reason <b>that the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>pure</b> if she discovered blood after this period has passed.",

            "<b>And if you would say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is dealing with a case <b>where</b> the <b>cloth is not in her hand,</b> and for this reason the time period that it is referring to is after the amount of time it would take for the woman to extend her hand and examine herself, this cannot be the case, as if so, the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>should have</b> taught two cases: <b>A cloth is in her hand, and: A cloth is not in her hand,</b> to differentiate between the situations. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, this <i>baraita</i> poses <b>a difficulty</b> to the opinion of Rav Ashi.",
            "§ The <i>baraita</i> teaches that <b>Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai, says:</b> If the examination took place following this period called: After time passed, <b>her husband</b> is not ritually impure at all, and therefore if he is a priest he <b>may enter the Sanctuary and burn incense.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And let him derive that</b> the husband is impure because <b>he is one who touched a menstruating woman during</b> the twenty-four-hour <b>period</b> before she discovered blood, as the Sages decreed that pure items touched by a menstruating woman in the twenty-four hours before she noticed the bleeding are impure retroactively.",
            "The Gemara answers that Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai, <b>who said</b> the ruling, holds <b>like Shammai, who said</b> in a mishna (2a): For <b>all women, their time is sufficient,</b> i.e., women who discern the emergence of menstrual blood do not need to be concerned that the flow of blood began before they noticed it, and they assume ritual impurity status only from that moment.",
            "The Gemara raises another difficulty with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai: <b>And let him derive</b> that the husband is impure <b>because he is one who experienced a seminal emission.</b> The Gemara answers that he is referring <b>to</b> a case where the husband <b>did not complete his</b> act of <b>intercourse.</b>",
            "§ The mishna states: <b>And the Rabbis concede to Rabbi Akiva in</b> the case of a woman who <b>sees</b> a blood <b>stain,</b> that she transmits seven-day impurity to the man with whom she engaged in intercourse. The Gemara cites a dispute of <i>amora’im</i> in this regard. <b>Rav says</b> that she renders the man with whom she engaged in intercourse impure <b>retroactively, and</b> this <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who maintains that a woman who sees a blood stain renders pure items impure retroactively (see 5a).",
            "<b>And Shmuel says</b> that she does not render him impure retroactively, but only if he engages in intercourse with her <b>from now and onward,</b> i.e., after she sees the blood stain, <b>and</b> this <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who hold that a woman who sees a blood stain renders pure items impure only from that moment onward.

            "The Gemara explains that it was necessary for the mishna to state this ruling, <b>lest you say: Since</b> the woman’s retroactive impurity for a twenty-four-hour <b>period</b> is a decree that applies <b>by rabbinic law, and</b> the impurity of blood <b>stains</b> also applies <b>by rabbinic law,</b> one might claim as follows: <b>Just as</b> her retroactive impurity of a twenty-four-hour <b>period does not render impure the man with whom she engaged in intercourse, so too,</b> her blood <b>stains</b> should <b>not render impure the man with whom she engaged in intercourse.</b> Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that she does render him impure from that point onward.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> perhaps one can <b>say</b> that <b>indeed,</b> she does not transmit impurity to him? The Gemara explains that there is a difference between the two types of rabbinic impurity: <b>There,</b> with regard to retroactive impurity, it is <b>not</b> a case of: The <b>slaughtered ox is before you,</b> i.e., the evidence of impurity did not exist at the time, as she had yet to experience menstruation. Therefore, the Sages did not apply the stringency of retroactive impurity to the husband. By contrast, <b>here,</b> with regard to the impurity of blood stains, it <b>is</b> a case of: The <b>slaughtered ox is before you,</b> as blood has appeared on the cloth.",
            "The Gemara notes: <b>And Reish Lakish similarly says,</b> like Rav, that the woman transmits impurity to the man with whom she engaged in intercourse <b>retroactively, and</b> this <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir.</b> But <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says,</b> like Shmuel: She renders him impure <b>from now and onward,</b> i.e., after she sees the blood stain, <b>and</b> this <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b>",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>All women have the presumptive status of purity for their husbands,</b> and therefore one is not required to ascertain whether his wife is ritually pure before engaging in intercourse with her.

            "The Gemara raises a difficulty with this principle: <b>And</b> does an uncertainty <b>not</b> override a certainty? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a <i>ḥaver</i> who died and left a storehouse filled with produce, even</b> if the produce was there only <b>that day,</b> it has the <b>presumptive status</b> of produce that was ritually <b>prepared,</b> i.e., properly tithed. This is due to the presumption that the <i>ḥaver</i> tithed the produce himself or instructed others to do so. The Gemara infers: <b>And here,</b> the produce was <b>definitely untithed</b> at the outset, and there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether the <i>ḥaver</i> <b>tithed it,</b> and there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether <b>he did not tithe it. And</b> despite this conflict, <b>the uncertainty</b> whether it was tithed <b>comes and overrides the certainty</b> that it was untithed produce.",
            "The Gemara rejects this claim: <b>There,</b> the conflict that leads to the question with regard to the produce’s status <b>is</b> between <b>certainty and certainty,</b> as the <i>ḥaver</i> certainly tithed the produce. This presumption is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rav Ḥanina Ḥoza’a; as Rav Ḥanina Ḥoza’a said:</b> There is <b>a presumption with regard to a <i>ḥaver</i> that he does not release an item from his possession that is not</b> ritually <b>prepared.</b>",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that in that case the conflict <b>is</b> between <b>uncertainty and uncertainty,</b> as it is possible that there was never an obligation to tithe this produce, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Oshaya. As Rabbi Oshaya said: A person can employ artifice</b> to circumvent obligations incumbent upon him in dealing <b>with his grain, and bring it into</b> his courtyard <b>in its chaff, so that his animal may eat</b> from it, <b>and</b> this grain <b>is exempt from tithe.</b> Although the obligation to tithe produce applies even to animal fodder, it is permitted to feed one’s animal untithed produce that was brought into one’s home before being fully processed. Consequently, the case involving produce is a conflict between two uncertain factors, as it is uncertain whether or not the owner was obligated to tithe the produce in the first place, and even if he was required to do so, it is uncertain whether or not he tithed it.",
            "The Gemara challenges: <b>And still,</b> is it correct that <b>an uncertainty does not override a certainty? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident involving the maidservant of a certain olive gatherer [<i>massik</i>] in</b> the city of <b>Rimon, who cast a non-viable newborn into a pit, and a priest came and looked</b> into the pit <b>to ascertain whether</b> the baby was <b>male</b> or <b>whether</b> it was <b>female,</b> as the length of time of a woman’s ritual impurity after childbirth, even if she gave birth to a non-viable newborn, depends on whether the child was male or female (see Leviticus, chapter 12).",
            "<b>And</b> the <b>incident came before the Sages</b> to rule whether or not the priest contracted ritual impurity while standing over the corpse, <b>and they deemed him ritually pure.</b> The basis for this ruling was: <b>Due to</b> the fact <b>that martens and hyenas are common there,</b> it is likely that the body was dragged away before the priest arrived at the pit.",
            "The Gemara explains the challenge from this <i>baraita</i>: <b>And here, where it is certain</b> that the maidservant <b>cast</b> the <b>non-viable newborn</b> into the pit, and it is <b>uncertain</b> whether an animal <b>dragged it</b> away and it is <b>uncertain</b> whether <b>no</b> animal <b>dragged it</b> away, the Sages nevertheless ruled that <b>an uncertainty comes and overrides a certainty.</b>",
            "The Gemara rejects this challenge: <b>Do not say</b> in the <i>baraita</i> <b>that</b> the woman certainly <b>cast a non-viable newborn into a pit; rather, say</b>"

            "that she cast an item <b>similar to a non-viable newborn</b> into a pit.

            "The Gemara challenges: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: And a priest came and looked into the pit <b>to ascertain whether</b> it was <b>male</b> or <b>whether</b> it was <b>female?</b> This indicates that the only uncertainty was with regard to its sex; it was certainly a non-viable newborn.",

            "Rav Naḥman <b>said to them:</b> A resolution can be found for your dilemma <b>from that which Huna our colleague said in the name of Rav:</b> With regard to <b>a woman who has</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle, and the</b> projected <b>time of her period arrived and she did not examine herself, and ultimately,</b> when she did examine herself, <b>she saw</b> blood, the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>she must be concerned for</b> ritual impurity from the projected time of <b>her period</b> and that therefore any pure items she touched since then are impure. <b>And</b> additionally, <b>she must be concerned</b> for ritual impurity with regard to the twenty-four hours prior <b>to her seeing</b> the blood, and any items she touched during those twenty-four hours are impure, even if she saw the blood a short while after the projected time of her period. <b>Evidently,</b> the concern for impurity of women at the projected time of their <b>periods</b> applies <b>by Torah law,</b> which is why the <i>halakha</i> is stringent.",
            "<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>this is what</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> the other Sages: The <b>reason</b> for Rav’s ruling that pure items she touched are retroactively considered impure is <b>that</b> she ultimately <b>saw</b> blood, from which it may be inferred that if <b>she did not see</b> blood, one is <b>not concerned</b> about the status of pure items that she touched from the projected time of her period, despite the fact that she neglected to examine herself at the time. <b>Evidently,</b> the concern for impurity of women at the projected time of their <b>periods</b> applies <b>by rabbinic law.</b>",

            "<b>Rabbi Zeira says:</b> It is possible <b>that everyone,</b> even Rav, agrees that the concern for impurity of women at the projected time of their <b>periods</b> applies <b>by Torah law,</b> and the reason Rav deems the woman pure in this case is that <b>here</b> it is a situation <b>where she examined herself within the period of time</b> needed for the onset of <b>menstruation,</b> i.e., very close to the projected time of her period, and therefore it is assumed that if there was blood at the projected time of her period she would have seen it upon this examination.

            "The Gemara continues to discuss this dispute between Rav and Shmuel. <b>Rav Sheshet says:</b> This disagreement between Rav and Shmuel is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>: Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that a woman who has a fixed menstrual cycle but who did not examine herself at the projected time of her period <b>is ritually impure as a menstruating woman,</b> which indicates that in his opinion the examination at the projected time of a woman’s period applies by Torah law.",
            "<b>And Rabbi Yehoshua says</b> that <b>she should be examined</b> now, despite the elapsed time, and if the examination came out clean she is pure retroactively as well.

            "The next case is <b>one who removes his nails and throws them into a public area.</b> The Gemara explains that this is dangerous <b>because a pregnant woman</b> might <b>pass over them, and</b> this can cause her to <b>miscarry.

The Gemara similarly explains: <b>Say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> reads: <b>One who examines</b> herself before or after <b>intercourse by the light of a lamp is repulsive,</b> as this examination would not be conducted properly, since the light of the lamp may not be sufficient. Nevertheless Beit Shammai say that a woman who engages in many acts of intercourse in one night must examine the cloth by the light of a lamp.",

            "The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that they would <b>examine their beds,</b> i.e., check the examination cloths, <b>by day.</b> The Gemara adds: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> that this is the correct explanation, <b>as if</b> it should <b>enter your mind</b> that it means that they would <b>engage in intercourse</b> by day, even if it is permitted, would the Sages have <b>mentioned them favorably</b> for this practice? The Gemara refutes this proof: <b>Yes,</b> it <b>is indeed so.</b> There is a praiseworthy aspect to engaging in intercourse by day, <b>as</b> at night <b>there is</b> a risk of being <b>overcome by sleep,</b> because the husband might be too tired after the exertions of the day, and <b>consequently</b> his wife who desires sexual intercourse might <b>be repulsive to him.</b>",
            "The Gemara further analyzes the <i>baraita</i>, which teaches: <b>And</b> the household of King Munbaz would <b>examine</b> before and after <b>intercourse, with wool of Parhava.</b> The Gemara notes: This statement <b>supports</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel, as Shmuel said: One may examine a bed,</b> i.e., use an examination cloth for intercourse, <b>only with</b> a cloth made of <b>linen [<i>befakolin</i>], or with</b> one made of <b>clean and soft wool.

            "The Gemara answers that this is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> statement that one may not examine with flax is referring <b>to flax</b> itself, whereas <b>that</b> statement of Rava, that flax is good for an examination, is referring <b>to flax garments.

            "If <b>part of</b> the snow <b>became impure, it does not all become impure,</b> but only the area that came into contact with the item of ritual impurity, as a pile of snow is not considered a single unit.

            "<b>Abaye says:</b> It is possible for all the snow to become impure, in a case <b>where one passed</b> the snow <b>within the airspace of</b> an earthenware vessel, such as <b>an oven,</b> in which the source of impurity was located.

            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> A woman’s reproductive organs are composed of different parts, and the halakhic status of blood that emerges from one part differs from the halakhic status of blood that emerges from another part. <b>The Sages stated a parable with regard to</b> the structure of the sexual organs of <b>a woman,</b> based on the structure of a house: <b>The</b> inner <b>room</b> represents the uterus, <b>and the corridor [<i>perozdor</i>]</b> leading to the inner room represents the vaginal canal, <b>and the upper story</b> represents the bladder.",

Consequently, she is impure due to the uncertainty.",
            "<b>Abaye says: What is different</b> about a situation where the blood was found <b>from the vestibule outward, where its</b> state of <b>uncertainty</b> renders it <b>impure?</b> The reason for that <i>halakha</i> is <b>that perhaps</b> the woman <b>bent over</b> and leaned forward, <b>and</b> the blood <b>came from the room,</b> i.e., the uterus. If so, in the case where the blood was found <b>from the vestibule inward,</b> concerning which you ruled that she is definitely impure, you can <b>also say</b> that it is possible that the woman <b>staggered</b> backward <b>and</b> as a result the blood <b>came from</b> the <b>upper story</b> to the back of the canal. Accordingly, she should be impure merely out of uncertainty.",
            "<b>Rather, Abaye says: If you follow the concern,</b> i.e., if your ruling of <i>halakha</i> is based on a concern that the blood might have moved due to the woman leaning forward or backward, then in both <b>this</b> case <b>and that,</b> whether the blood is found in the inner or outer section of the canal, the source of the blood <b>is uncertain.

            "If so, <b>shall we say</b> that Rami bar Shmuel and Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, <b>disagree</b> with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> who deems the blood definitely impure, whereas they maintain that it is impure merely due to uncertainty?",

Once again the reason is that Rav Ketina and Rabbi Ḥiyya might be referring to two different cases: <b>Here,</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya deems the blood definitely impure because he is speaking of a case <b>where it is found on the floor of</b> the <b>corridor,</b> in which case the blood is presumed to come from the uterus rather than the bladder. <b>And there,</b> Rav Ketina, who deems the blood impure due to uncertainty, is referring to blood <b>that is found on the roof of</b> the <b>corridor,</b> and therefore it is uncertain whether the blood came from the bladder or the uterus.",
            "§ <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: In three places</b> where there is uncertainty <b>the Sages followed the majority, and</b> based on that majority <b>they established</b> the <i>halakha</i> in these cases <b>as</b> though they involved <b>a certainty.</b> The three cases are as follows: The <b>source,</b> the <b>afterbirth [<i>shilya</i>],</b> and <b>a shaped</b> limb. The Gemara elaborates: The <b>source</b> is <b>that which we</b> just <b>said,</b> i.e., that blood found in the corridor from the vestibule and inward it is ritually impure, because the majority of blood found there is from the uterus.",
            "The <b>afterbirth</b> is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (26a): If a woman miscarried and <b>the afterbirth</b> is <b>in the house, the house is ritually impure,</b> in the sense that everything under the roof becomes impure due to impurity imparted by a corpse. <b>And</b> the reason is <b>not that the afterbirth</b> itself has the status of <b>an offspring; rather,</b> it is <b>that there is no afterbirth without an offspring.</b> It is clear that the afterbirth contained an offspring, which disintegrated after the miscarriage. That offspring renders the contents of the house impure. <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The <b>offspring was squashed before it emerged</b> with the afterbirth. Consequently, the house is not rendered impure, because the squashed fetus is nullified by the majority of blood that accompanied the miscarriage.",
            "The third case of an uncertainty where the Sages followed the majority is that of <b>a shaped</b> limb, <b>as we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of a woman <b>who miscarries a shaped hand,</b> i.e., its fingers are discernible, <b>or a shaped foot, its mother is impure</b> with the impurity of a woman after <b>childbirth,</b> as it certainly came from a full-fledged fetus, <b>and we are not concerned</b> that <b>perhaps it came from</b> a fetus with <b>a sealed,</b> i.e., deficient <b>body,</b> in which case the miscarriage does not have the status of childbirth with regard to ritual impurity. The reason is that most pregnant women give birth to a fully formed fetus, and therefore it is presumed that the hand or foot came from a whole fetus that was squashed during childbirth. Once again the Sages established the impurity as a certainty, based on a majority.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And are there no more</b> cases of uncertainty in which the Sages determined the <i>halakha</i> according to the status of the majority, treating the case as though it involved a certainty? <b>But isn’t there</b> the case of <b>nine stores?</b>",
            "<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>nine stores</b> in a city, <b>all of which sell</b> kosher <b>meat</b> from <b>slaughtered</b> animals, <b>and one</b> other store that <b>sells meat</b> from unslaughtered <b>animal carcasses, and</b> a person <b>bought</b> meat <b>from one of</b> the stores <b>and he does not know from which</b> store <b>he bought</b> the meat, in this case of <b>uncertainty,</b> the meat <b>is prohibited.</b> With regard to an item of uncertain status, if it separated from its fixed location it is presumed to have separated from the majority of items like it in that location, and has their halakhic status. But in the case of an item that remained in its fixed location, i.e., didn’t separate, it is viewed as an uncertainty that is equally balanced, and one does not follow the majority. This ruling is based on the principle: The halakhic status of uncertainty with regard to any item fixed in its place is that of an uncertainty that is equally balanced, and one does not follow the majority.In this case, when it comes to determining whether or not this meat comes from a kosher store, since the uncertainty stems from the act of buying the meat in the store, and the stores are fixed in their places, the two types of stores are regarded as though they were equal in number.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And in the</b> case of meat <b>found</b> in the street, outside the stores, <b>follow the majority</b> of stores. If most stores in the city sell kosher meat one can assume that the meat he found is kosher, based on the principle: Any item separated, i.e., not fixed in its place, is presumed to have been separated from the majority. Similar to the previous cases, this meat is treated as certainly kosher on the basis of a majority.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>We say</b> that this list of cases mentioned by Rabbi Yoḥanan is referring to matters of <b>ritual impurity,</b> whereas <b>we do not say</b> that the list includes cases that involve <b>prohibitions,</b> such as that of non-kosher meat.",
            "The Gemara further asks: <b>But isn’t there</b> the case where there were <b>nine</b> dead <b>frogs,</b> which do not impart ritual impurity, <b>and one</b> carcass of a <b>creeping animal among them,</b> which does impart impurity, <b>and</b> someone <b>touched one of</b> these ten dead creatures, <b>and he does not know which of them he touched?</b> The <i>halakha</i> is as follows: If this occurred <b>in the private domain</b> the item’s <b>uncertain</b> impurity renders it <b>impure,</b> as it is derived from the Torah that in cases of uncertainty with regard to ritual impurity in the private domain, the item is deemed impure. If the contact occurred <b>in the public domain,</b> the item’s <b>uncertainty</b> leaves it <b>pure.</b>",
            "The Gemara continues: <b>And in</b> a case where one of these creatures was separated from the rest and <b>was found</b> elsewhere, and the person touched it there, <b>follow the majority.</b> Since most of the animals do not impart ritual impurity, this individual remains pure. This is another case involving uncertain impurity where the Sages established the <i>halakha</i> as certain based on the majority.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>We say</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan’s list is referring to matters of <b>ritual impurity of a woman,</b> whereas <b>we do not say</b> that the list includes cases that involve <b>ritual impurity in general.</b>",

        [
            "<b>and she miscarried</b> her fetus into the river, but she does not know whether or not the fetus was fully formed, <b>she brings</b> the <b>offering</b> of a woman after childbirth, i.e., a burnt offering and a sin offering. <b>And</b> the sin offering, which is a bird, <b>is eaten</b> after the nape of its neck has been severed, in the manner of a regular bird sin offering. This is the <i>halakha</i> despite the uncertainty, i.e., this fetus might not have been fully formed, in which case the woman is not obligated to bring this offering, and a bird that is not an offering may not be eaten if its nape was severed.",
            "Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi explains the reasoning behind this ruling: One must <b>follow the majority of</b> pregnant <b>women, and most</b> pregnant <b>women give birth to full-fledged offspring.</b> If so, this is another case involving an uncertainty where the Sages established the <i>halakha</i> as a certainty based on the majority. Furthermore, this case involves the ritual impurity of a woman. Why then did Rabbi Yoḥanan list only three cases of this kind?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>We say</b> that only cases taught in <b>the Mishna</b> or a <i>baraita</i> are included in this list, whereas <b>we do not say</b> that those derived from an amoraic <b>halakhic statement,</b> e.g., the statement of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, are included.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to this explanation: <b>But when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <b>he said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Ḥanina raises an objection</b> against the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi from a <i>baraita</i> that deals with <b>an unsure woman,</b> i.e., one who does not know when she gave birth. Ravin added: <b>And I do not know what his objection</b> was from that <i>baraita</i>.",
            "The Gemara discusses Ravin’s statement: <b>What, is it not</b> correct to say that Ravin meant that this <i>baraita</i> is <b>not a refutation</b> of the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>but</b> actually provides <b>support</b> for that opinion? If so, that would mean that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi’s opinion is effectively taught in a <i>baraita</i> as well, and therefore according to the above consideration Rabbi Yoḥanan should have included it in his list.",
            "The Gemara answers: This is <b>not</b> necessarily the correct inference, as <b>perhaps</b> Ravin meant simply that the ruling of this <i>baraita</i> is <b>neither a refutation nor a support</b> for the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi.",
            "§ When Rabbi Yoḥanan says that in three places where there is uncertainty the Sages followed the majority and established the <i>halakha</i> as though it involved a certainty, he is clearly indicating that some cases are excluded from this category. The Gemara asks: Rabbi Yoḥanan says this <b>to exclude what?</b>",
            "<b>If we say</b> that he says this <b>to exclude</b> an uncertain case where on the one hand there is <b>a majority that</b> indicates the woman should be deemed ritually impure and on the other hand <b>there is a presumptive status along with it</b> that opposes that majority, <b>which</b> is why the uncertainty is not treated as a certainty, and therefore <b>one does not burn <i>teruma</i> due to</b> contact with that impurity, this cannot be the case. The reason is that Rabbi Yoḥanan already <b>said it</b> on <b>another occasion,</b> with regard to other cases of ritual impurity, that if the consideration of a majority indicates that an item should be impure while its presumptive status indicates that it should be pure, it is not considered definitely impure.",
            "The Gemara cites the source for Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion in this regard. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 3:8): If a ritually impure <b>child is found alongside</b> ritually pure <b>started dough</b> that has not yet risen, <b>and</b> he has <b>risen dough in his hand</b> that may have been removed from the larger portion of started dough, <b>Rabbi Meir deems</b> the started dough <b>pure,</b> since there is no proof the child touched it, as he might have been given the piece by someone else. <b>And the Rabbis deem it impure,</b> as they assume that he touched the started dough. The child is presumed to be impure, <b>because it is the norm of a child to handle</b> items.",

Therefore, one should <b>append</b> the fact that the <b>minority</b> of children do not handle items within reach <b>to the presumptive status</b> of purity of the dough, <b>and</b> the force of the <b>majority</b> of children who handle items within reach <b>is weakened.</b> Therefore, the dough is considered pure.",
            "<b>And the Rabbis</b> contend that in a case where the majority is followed, <b>the minority is considered like it does not exist.

In this context, Rabbi Yoḥanan has already stated that when a majority is contradicted by a presumption, the status of uncertainty applies. Therefore, there was no need for him to specify the three cases he mentioned in order to exclude situations of this kind.",

            "<b>Rabbi Ḥama bar Yosef says</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya says:</b> The <b>verse states</b> with regard to those who come before the court: <b>“If there arise a matter too hard for you in judgment, between blood and blood,</b> between plea and plea, and between leprous mark and leprous mark, even matters of controversy within your gates, then you shall arise, and get up unto the place that the Lord your God shall choose” (Deuteronomy 17:8). When the verse states: “Between blood and blood,” it means <b>between pure blood and impure blood,</b> which demonstrates that there must be types of pure blood that are emitted by a woman.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If that is so,</b> then does the other expression in the verse: <b>“Between leprous mark and leprous mark,” also</b> mean: <b>Between a pure leprous mark and an impure leprous mark? And if you would say</b> that <b>indeed,</b> this is what it means, <b>is there</b> a type of <b>pure leprous mark?

            "<b>Rather,</b> the phrase “between leprous mark and leprous mark” must mean the following: <b>Between the leprous marks</b> that afflict <b>man</b> (see Leviticus 13:1–46) <b>and the leprous marks of houses</b> (see Leviticus 14:33–53) <b>and the leprous marks of garments</b> (see Leviticus 13:47–59), as different <i>halakhot</i> pertain to these categories of leprous marks, <b>and</b> yet <b>they are all ritually impure.</b> Therefore, <b>here too,</b> when the verse states: “Between blood and blood,” it means: <b>Between the blood of a menstruating woman and the blood of a discharge [<i>ziva</i>], and they are all ritually impure.</b> If so, this verse cannot be cited as proof that there is a type of blood emitted by a woman that is pure.",
            "The Gemara questions this interpretation: This verse serves as the source for the areas of <i>halakha</i> for which a rebellious elder is liable to receive the death penalty for publicly ruling in contradiction to a decision of the Sanhedrin, as it states: “And the man who does presumptuously, in not listening to the priest that stands to minister there before the Lord your God, or to the judge, that man shall die; and you shall exterminate the evil from Israel” (Deuteronomy 17:12). With this in mind, the Gemara asks: <b>What is this</b> explanation? <b>Granted, there,</b> with regard to leprous marks, even if all the leprous marks are impure, <b>one can disagree</b> with the Sanhedrin <b>with regard to the leprous marks</b> that afflict <b>man, and</b> therefore the rebellious elder could potentially disagree with the court <b>with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute of Rabbi Yehoshua and the Rabbis.</b>",
            "<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Nega’im</i> 4:11): <b>If</b> the <b>snow-white leprous mark [<i>baheret</i>],</b> which is one sign of leprosy, <b>preceded</b> the <b>white hair,</b> which is another sign, he is <b>ritually impure,</b> as stated in the Torah (see Leviticus 13:3). <b>And if</b> the <b>white hair preceded</b> the <b><i>baheret</i></b> he is <b>pure,</b> as this is not considered a sign of impurity.

            "Likewise, <b>with regard to the leprous marks of houses</b> one can find a case where the rebellious elder might dispute the ruling of the Sanhedrin, such <b>as that dispute between Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, and the Rabbis.

            "Similarly, <b>with regard to the leprous marks on garments,</b> it is possible that the rebellious elder disputed the ruling of the Sanhedrin <b>with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute between Rabbi Yonatan ben Avtolemos and the Rabbis.

            "It is derived via a verbal analogy: <b>A bareness within [<i>karaḥat</i>] and a bareness without [<i>gabbaḥat</i>]</b> are <b>stated with regard to</b> leprosy of <b>garments:</b> “And the priest shall look, after that the mark is washed; and, behold, if the mark has not changed its color, and the mark has not spread, it is impure; you shall burn it in the fire; it is a fret, whether the bareness be within or without” (Leviticus 13:55); <b>and a bald head [<i>karaḥat</i>] and a bald forehead [<i>gabbaḥat</i>]</b> are <b>stated with regard to</b> leprosy of <b>a person:</b> “But if there is in the bald head, or the bald forehead, a reddish-white mark, it is leprosy breaking out in his bald head, or his bald forehead” (Leviticus 13:42).",

            "The Gemara concludes: <b>But here,</b> concerning the phrase “between blood and blood,” <b>if there is no</b> type of <b>pure blood</b> at all, <b>with regard to what</b> issue could the rebellious elder <b>disagree</b> with the Sanhedrin? It must be that this verse is alluding to the fact that there is a type of blood of a woman that is pure.",
            "§ Once it has been established that there are types of blood that are pure and other types that are impure, the Gemara asks: <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that those</b> types of blood that are not listed in the mishna are <b>pure, and these</b> ones that are mentioned in the mishna are <b>impure? Rabbi Abbahu said that the verse states:</b> “And the sun shone upon the water, <b>and the Moabites saw the water</b> some way off <b>as red as blood”</b> (II Kings 3:22), which indicates that blood is red. The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that blood is red?</b> If so, one can <b>say</b> that only blood that is <b>red</b> like the blood of a wound is ritually impure, <b>and no more</b> colors of blood are impure.",
            "<b>Rabbi Abbahu said</b> in response: <b>The verse states,</b> with regard to a menstruating woman: “And she shall be purified from the source of <b>her blood [<i>dameha</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 12:7).

And another verse states: “And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness, he has made naked her source, and she has uncovered the source of <b>her blood [<i>dameha</i>];</b> both of them shall be cut off from among their people” (Leviticus 20:18). The use of the plural form of blood once again indicates another two types, which means that <b>there are four</b> types of blood stated <b>here.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that there are <b>five</b> types of impure blood in a woman, whereas the verses indicate that there are only four? <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> The <b>black</b> blood mentioned in the mishna <b>is</b> actually <b>red, but</b> its color <b>has faded,</b> which is why it looks black. Therefore, although the mishna lists five kinds of blood, there are only four basic types.",
            "<b>This</b> opinion, that black blood is actually red blood, <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b>black</b> color of blood that is impure is blood as black <b>as <i>ḥeret</i>.</b> If the black is <b>deeper than that,</b> the blood is <b>ritually impure;</b> if the black is <b>lighter</b> than that, <b>even</b> if it is still as dark <b>as blue,</b> the blood is <b>ritually pure.

He</b> again <b>saw</b> that blood <b>in the day,</b> after it had dried, <b>and deemed</b> it <b>pure.</b> He <b>waited one hour</b> and then <b>deemed</b> it <b>impure again.</b> It is assumed that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi did not conduct another examination at this point; rather, he reasoned that the previous night’s examination had been correct, and the blood’s color should be deemed impure because of how it had looked when it was moist. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi then <b>said: Woe is me! Perhaps I erred</b> by declaring the blood impure, as based on its color it should be pure.",
            "The Gemara questions this statement: <b>Perhaps I erred? He certainly erred, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>a halakhic authority may not say: If</b> the blood <b>were moist it would certainly have been impure,</b> and yet here, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi deemed the blood impure based on that type of reasoning.",
            "The Gemara explains that the incident did not unfold as initially assumed. <b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi examined the blood three times, as he <b>said: A judge has only what his eyes see</b> as the basis for his ruling. <b>Initially,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>established the presumptive status</b> of the blood <b>as ritually impure,</b> but <b>when he saw in the morning that</b> its color had <b>changed, he said: It was definitely pure</b> last night as well, <b>and only</b> because it was <b>at night</b> I thought that it was impure, <b>because it could not be seen well.</b> Subsequently, <b>when he saw</b> after a short while <b>that</b> its color <b>again changed,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: This</b> blood <b>is impure, and it is gradually becoming lighter</b> as its color fades.",
            "With regard to the manner in which the Sages would examine blood, the Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>would examine</b> blood <b>by candlelight.

Therefore, the term “in her flesh” applies to the blood in the cracks. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that <b>it is not the manner of a woman to see</b> menstrual <b>blood in a piece</b> of tissue that she discharges. Therefore, the blood found in the piece of tissue is not considered menstrual blood, and it does not render the woman impure.",
            "<b>Rava says</b> there is another explanation of this dispute: <b>Everyone,</b> both the first <i>tanna</i> and the Rabbis, agrees that <b>it is not the manner of a woman to see</b> menstrual <b>blood in a piece</b> of tissue that she discharges. Consequently, the blood that emerges from the cracks in the piece of tissue is not considered menstrual blood, and it does not render the woman impure.",
            "<b>And here, they disagree</b> as <b>to</b> whether it is possible that the <b>woman</b> herself is <b>pure but the location of the source,</b> i.e., the uterus, <b>is impure. As Rabbi Eliezer holds</b> that the <b>woman is pure,</b> i.e., she was not rendered a menstruating woman with the discharge of the blood, <b>but the blood is impure,</b> despite the fact that it emerged in a piece of tissue, <b>as it emerged through the source,</b> which is impure. Therefore, when the blood comes into contact with the woman’s body she contracts first-degree impurity, and the woman subsequently transmits impurity to foods that she touches. <b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that the <b>woman is</b> entirely <b>pure, and the location of the source is</b> also <b>pure.</b> Therefore, pure food that she touches is not rendered impure.",
            "§ <b>Rabba asked Rav Huna</b> a similar question to the case of the tube: With regard to a man <b>who sees semen</b> by extracting it from his penis <b>with a sliver of wood, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does he assume the impurity status of one who experiences a seminal emission? The Gemara explains the question. The verse states: “A man from whom the flow of semen emerges” (Leviticus 22:4). Since <b>the Merciful One states: “From whom,”</b> is it derived that the man is not impure <b>unless</b> the semen <b>emerges from his flesh</b> by itself, <b>and not</b> when it is extracted <b>with a sliver of wood? Or perhaps</b> from <b>this</b> term: <b>“From whom,”</b> it is derived merely that the man is not impure <b>unless his impurity,</b> i.e., his semen, <b>emerges outside</b> his body, <b>but</b> he is impure <b>even</b> if this is achieved <b>with a sliver of wood.</b>",
            "Rav Huna <b>said to</b> Rabba: <b>Derive</b> that the man is pure from the fact <b>that</b> semen <b>itself becomes impure only in</b> a case where the discharge is substantial enough to cause <b>a blockage of the tip of the penis.</b> Since this amount cannot be extracted with a sliver of wood, it is not impure.",
            "Rabba replied to Rav Huna: Since a minimum measure is required for this impurity, <b>is this to say that</b> the reason a man who experiences a seminal emission is impure <b>is</b> that his penis <b>touches</b> the semen after it is emitted? If he was rendered impure merely by the emission of the semen then no minimum measure would apply, as is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a menstruating woman. But <b>if that is so,</b> then a seminal emission <b>should not negate</b> the count of seven clean days <b>for</b> a man who experienced a gonorrhea-like <b>discharge [<i>ziva</i>].</b> A <i>zav</i> does not stop his counting when he touches a source of impurity, e.g., the carcass of a creeping animal.",
            "If so, <b>why is it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is derived from the verse’s juxtaposition between a <i>zav</i> and one who experienced a seminal emission: <b>“This is the law of the <i>zav</i>, and of one from whom the flow of semen emerges”</b> (Leviticus 15:32), that <b>just as <i>ziva</i></b> during the seven clean days <b>negates</b> the count, <b>so too, a seminal emission negates</b> the count. If it is not the emission itself that renders the man impure but only his contact with the semen, why does the emission negate the count of seven clean days?",
            "Rav Huna <b>said to</b> Rabba in response: The <i>halakha</i> of <b>negation</b> is not difficult, as <b>this is the reason that</b> a seminal emission <b>negates</b> the count of seven clean days: <b>Because it is impossible for</b> a <i>zav</i> to experience a seminal emission <b>without</b> it containing <b>bits of [<i>tzaḥtzoḥei</i>] <i>ziva</i>.</b>",
            "Rabba further objected: <b>If that is so,</b> then a seminal emission <b>should negate the entire</b> count of <b>seven</b> clean days, just like an emission of <i>ziva</i>, not merely the day on which the seminal emission occurred. But then <b>why is it taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: It is derived from the verse: <b>“This is the law of the <i>zav</i>,</b> and of one from whom the flow of semen emerges, so that he is impure by it” (Leviticus 15:32), that <b>just as <i>ziva</i></b> during the seven clean days <b>negates</b> the count, <b>so too, a seminal emission negates</b> the count.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>If</b> a seminal emission is compared to <i>ziva</i>, then it might be suggested that <b>just as <i>ziva</i> negates the entire</b> count of <b>seven</b> days, <b>so too, a seminal emission</b> should <b>also negate the entire</b> count of <b>seven</b> days. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “So that he is impure by it,”</b> to teach that <b>in</b> the case of a seminal emission <b>you have</b> a negation of the count that is equivalent <b>only</b> to the impurity <b>that is stated by it,</b> i.e., impurity for one day. Accordingly, a seminal emission <b>negates</b> only <b>one day</b> of the count, not the entire count. This apparently contradicts Rav Huna’s statement that the reason a seminal emission negates the count at all is that the seminal emission of a <i>zav</i> always contains <i>ziva</i>.",
            "Rav Huna <b>said to</b> Rabba: <b>It is a Torah edict</b> that an emission that is <b>purely <i>ziva</i>, when semen is not mixed in it, negates the entire</b> count of <b>seven</b> days, whereas <b>bits of <i>ziva</i> in which</b> some <b>semen is mixed negate only one day</b> of the count.",

The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> there is the case of a woman who discharges an item similar to <b>a bird, whose eyes are not fixed in the front of</b> its head, <b>and</b> nevertheless <b>Rabbi Meir says that</b> the woman <b>is impure.</b> This apparently contradicts Rabbi Yannai’s explanation. <b>Abaye said:</b> Rabbi Meir is referring <b>to</b> the <b>little owl [<i>bekarya</i>] and</b> the <b>great owl [<i>vekifofa</i>],</b> whose eyes are fixed in the front of their heads, <b>but in</b> the case of a woman who discharges any of the <b>other</b> species of <b>birds,</b> Rabbi Meir does <b>not</b> deem her impure.",

            "<b>We, too, learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Bekhorot</i> 46a) that the fetus of a woman that has the form of an animal cannot survive: In the case of a woman <b>who</b> had previously <b>discharged a fetus</b> with the appearance <b>similar to</b> that <b>of a domesticated animal, an undomesticated animal, or bird</b> before giving birth to any children, and subsequently she gives birth to a son, the son is considered a firstborn with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of inheritance, but he does not require redemption, as the fetus is considered a full-fledged offspring in that regard. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say:</b> The son is not exempted from the requirement of redemption from a priest <b>unless</b> it follows the birth of a fetus <b>that takes the form of a person;</b> otherwise, it is not considered the offspring that “opens the womb” (Exodus 13:2), and the son requires redemption as a firstborn.",

            "<b>Rava said,</b> in rejection of this proof: <b>Actually,</b> it is possible <b>that</b> a fetus shaped like an animal <b>can survive; but it is different there,</b> with regard to inheritance.

It is derived from the verse that the status of a firstborn applies only to a son <b>over whose</b> death a father would <b>mourn.</b> The word <i>ono</i> is interpreted homiletically based on its similarity to the word <i>onen</i>, acute mourner. <b>This</b> offspring that has the form of an animal is therefore <b>excluded, as</b> its father <b>would not mourn over its</b> death.",
            "§ <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava asked Abaye: According to Rabbi Meir, who said</b> that an item that is similar to <b>an animal in the womb of a woman is</b> considered <b>a full-fledged offspring, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a human</b> fetus <b>in the womb of an animal?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>What is the</b> practical <b>difference</b> of this inquiry?

Therefore, it is possible that the human fetus is permitted for consumption, and the dilemma remains unresolved.",
            "§ The mishna teaches: <b>And the Rabbis say: Any</b> discharged entity <b>that is not</b> of human form does not render the woman impure. <b>Rav Yirmeya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rav says: All concede</b> that if a woman discharged an entity <b>whose body is</b> that of <b>a goat and whose face is</b> that of <b>a human,</b> it is considered <b>a human</b> offspring, i.e., even the Rabbis rule that the woman is impure in this case.

            "<b>And Shmuel explains</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>according to his</b> line of <b>reasoning,</b> in the following manner: If an animal fetus is <b>born</b> in the <b>fourth</b> month of pregnancy in the case <b>of small</b> domesticated animals, or it is <b>born</b> in the <b>eighth</b> month of pregnancy in the case <b>of large</b> livestock, or if it was born <b>from this</b> stage of the pregnancy <b>and earlier,</b> the animal is <b>forbidden. In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> In a case <b>when</b> the fetus’s <b>months</b> of gestation <b>were not completed; but</b> in a case when <b>its months</b> of gestation <b>were completed, it is permitted</b> for consumption even outside the womb. This <b>excludes</b> a fetus <b>that has two backs and two spines, as even in</b> a case where <b>its months</b> of gestation <b>were completed, if it emerged into the airspace of the world, it is forbidden,</b> whereas if it is found <b>in the womb of its mother, it is permitted.</b>",
            "<b>A <i>tanna</i> taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav:</b> In the case of a woman <b>who discharges an entity</b> that has <b>a shapeless body,</b> i.e., it does not have the outline of limbs, <b>or an entity</b> that has <b>a shapeless head,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>its mother should be impure</b> with the impurity of a woman after <b>childbirth.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “If a woman bears seed and gives birth to a male,</b> she shall be impure seven days; as in the days of the menstruation of her sickness she shall be impure. <b>And on the eighth day</b> the flesh of his foreskin <b>shall be circumcised”</b> (Leviticus 12:2–3).",
            "Those verses teach that the impurity of a woman after childbirth applies only to one who gave birth to a child <b>that is fit for circumcision</b> on the <b>eighth</b> day, <b>excluding these</b> cases, <b>where</b> the child <b>is not fit for circumcision</b> on the <b>eighth</b> day, as it cannot survive that long. Consequently, this woman does not have the impurity of a woman after childbirth. <b>Rav said to</b> the <i>tanna</i>: <b>And conclude</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>like this:</b> Excluding these cases, where the child is not fit for circumcision on the eighth day, <b>and</b> excluding the case of a woman who discharges a child <b>that has two backs and two spines.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba thought to perform an action,</b> i.e., to issue a ruling, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel,</b> that a woman who gives birth to a child with two backs and two spines is impure. <b>Rav Huna said to him: What is your thinking?</b> That as this matter is subject to a dispute, one should rule <b>stringently?</b> Your ruling <b>is a stringency that leads to a leniency, as you have given</b> the woman a period of thirty-three days following her period of impurity when any blood that emerges is <b>blood of purity. In any event,</b> you should <b>perform,</b> i.e., issue your ruling, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav, as we maintain</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav with regard to ritual matters, whether</b> his opinion leads <b>to a leniency or to a stringency.</b>",
            "§ <b>Rava says:</b> The Sages <b>said</b> that <b>a woman can give birth</b> to a viable offspring <b>after nine</b> months of pregnancy <b>or after seven</b> months of pregnancy; but if a woman gives birth after eight months of pregnancy, the child cannot survive and is stillborn. Similarly, <b>a large domesticated animal gives birth</b> to a viable offspring <b>after nine</b> months of pregnancy, and if it discharges a fetus after only eight months, the newborn animal cannot survive. With this in mind, Rava asked: Can a large domesticated animal <b>give birth</b> to a viable offspring <b>after seven</b> months of pregnancy, like a human, <b>or</b> can such an animal <b>not give birth</b> to a viable offspring after only seven months?",
            "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to this dilemma from the aforementioned <i>baraita</i>: If an animal discharges <b>from this</b> stage of the pregnancy <b>and earlier,</b> the fetus is <b>forbidden</b> in consumption as an unslaughtered animal carcass. <b>What, is it not</b> referring <b>to large</b> livestock, which indicates that large livestock do not give birth to a viable offspring after only seven months of pregnancy? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the reference is specifically <b>to small</b> domesticated animals, which do not give birth to a viable offspring until after five months of pregnancy.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to this answer: <b>What is this? Granted, if you say</b> that the reference is <b>to large</b> livestock, it is <b>necessary</b> for the <i>baraita</i> to state that an animal does not give birth to a viable offspring after less than a complete period of pregnancy, as otherwise it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since in</b> the case of <b>a woman</b> who gives birth after seven months the baby <b>survives,</b> it is logical that <b>in</b> the case of a large domesticated <b>animal</b> that gives birth after seven months the newborn <b>also survives,</b> and it is therefore permitted for consumption. Consequently, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us that</b> such an animal <b>does not survive.</b>",
            "<b>But if you say</b> that the ruling in the <i>baraita</i>, that if an animal discharged a fetus before the period of gestation was completed then the fetus is prohibited, <b>was stated with regard to small</b> domesticated animals, isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that if a sheep or goat fetus was discharged at this stage it cannot survive? <b>Can it survive after</b> only <b>three months</b> of gestation?",
            "The Gemara answers that in fact <b>it is necessary</b> for the <i>baraita</i> to state this <i>halakha</i> with regard to small domesticated animals, as otherwise it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>any</b> mammal that is born <b>two months less</b> than its complete gestation <b>survives,</b> just as a human born at seven months of gestation survives. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that a sheep or goat that is born at three months of gestation cannot survive and is forbidden for consumption.",
            "§ <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> In the case of a woman <b>who discharges</b> a fetus that has <b>the form of a lilith,</b> a female demon with wings and a human face, <b>its mother is impure</b> with the impurity of a woman after <b>childbirth,</b> as <b>it is</b> a viable <b>offspring, only it has wings.

            "There was a case of a woman <b>who discharged</b> an item that had <b>the form of a snake.

            "<b>While they were going</b> to Rabban Gamliel, <b>Ḥanina’s daughter-in-law went out to greet</b> Rabbi Yehoshua, and <b>said to him: My teacher, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a woman <b>who discharges</b> an item that looks <b>like a snake?</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to her: Its mother is pure.

            "<b>Abaye said: Conclude from</b> this incident that <b>a Torah scholar [<i>tzurva merabbanan</i>] who says</b> a halakhic <b>matter should say the reason</b> for his statement, <b>so that when</b> his colleagues <b>remind him</b> of his reasoning, <b>he will remember</b> that ruling, as happened to Rabbi Yehoshua.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> A woman <b>who discharges a gestational sac full of fluid, full of blood,</b> or <b>full of</b> different <b>colors</b> need <b>not be concerned that</b> it was <b>an offspring.

A woman <b>who discharges a sandal</b> fetus, i.e., one that has the form of a sandal fish, <b>and</b> one who discharges <b>an afterbirth observes</b> the strictures of a woman who gave birth both <b>to a male and to a female.</b>",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Granted,</b> one can understand why a woman who discharges a gestational sac full of <b>blood or water</b> is pure, as such an item <b>is nothing,</b> i.e., it is not an offspring. <b>But</b> if the gestational sac was full of different <b>colors, let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps it was an offspring and</b> it <b>liquefied. Abaye says</b> in response: <b>How much undiluted wine,</b> which can be harmful to an embryo, <b>did the mother of this</b> purported embryo <b>drink, that her embryo was liquefied in her womb?</b> In other words, there is no such concern.",
            "<b>Rava says</b> that there is a different explanation: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna that the gestational sac was <b>full</b> of different colors, <b>and if it is so,</b> that there was an embryo in the sac <b>that liquefied,</b> the sac would have been <b>lacking</b> some of the mass of the liquified portion. <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava says</b> that there is yet another explanation: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna that the gestational sac is full of different <b>colors, and if it is so,</b> that there was an embryo there <b>that liquefied, it would all be of one color.</b>",
            "With regard to the effect of drinking wine on a person’s body, <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Abba Shaul says: I used to be a gravedigger, and I would observe the bones of corpses.</b> I discovered that <b>the bones of one who drinks</b> too much <b>undiluted wine</b> during his lifetime look <b>burnt, the bones of</b> one who drinks too much <b>diluted</b> wine <b>are black,</b> and <b>the bones of</b> one who drinks the <b>appropriate</b> amount of wine <b>are fat,</b> i.e., full of marrow. <b>And</b> furthermore, I discovered that <b>the bones of anyone who drinks</b> much <b>more than he eats</b> look <b>burnt, the bones of</b> one who <b>eats</b> much <b>more than he drinks are black,</b> and <b>the bones of one who</b> eats and drinks <b>appropriate</b> amounts <b>are fat.</b>",

            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion that the dispute between Rabbi Yehoshua and the Rabbis applies only in a case where the amniotic fluid is turbid.

This <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, does not make skin for a person unless he is</b> already <b>created,</b> as God first created Adam and Eve, and then gave them skin.

            "<b>Evidently,</b> according to Rabbi Yehoshua <b>the matter</b> of whether or not an embryo is considered offspring <b>is dependent on</b> whether or not there is <b>skin,</b> and there <b>is no difference</b> whether the amniotic fluid is <b>turbid, and</b> there <b>is no difference</b> whether it is <b>clear.</b>",
            "<b>Granted, if you say</b> that the <b>dispute</b> applies <b>in</b> a case where it is <b>clear, that is</b> why it <b>was necessary</b> for Rabbi Yehoshua to derive from <b>a verse</b> that an embryo that has skin is considered an offspring. <b>But if you say</b> that the <b>dispute</b> applies <b>in</b> a case where the amniotic fluid is <b>turbid,</b> but Rabbi Yehoshua concedes that the woman is pure if it is clear, <b>why do I</b> need <b>a verse</b> to teach that if the amniotic fluid is turbid the woman is impure? <b>It is logical</b> that where the amniotic fluid is turbid there was probably an embryo that liquefied. <b>Rather, conclude from it</b> that the <b>dispute</b> applies <b>in</b> a case where the amniotic fluid is <b>clear.</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>Conclude from it</b> that this is correct.",
            "<b>And likewise,</b> just as Rabbi Oshaya interprets the dispute between Rabbi Yehoshua and the Rabbis as referring to a case where the amniotic fluid is turbid, <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Yehoshua and the Rabbis applies <b>in</b> a case where the amniotic fluid is <b>turbid; but in</b> a case where the amniotic fluid is <b>clear, everyone agrees</b> that the discharged sac <b>is not</b> considered <b>an offspring.</b>",
            "<b>Rava raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman</b> from a mishna that specifies the obligations that apply to firstborn animals (<i>Bekhorot</i> 19b):<b>But</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that not only does a viable offspring exempt any subsequent offspring from being counted a firstborn, but the same applies to <b>an indication of the offspring</b> that is discharged from the womb. The indication <b>in a small animal</b> is a <b>murky discharge</b> from the womb, <b>in a large</b> animal it is the emergence of <b>an afterbirth,</b> and <b>in a woman</b> the indication is <b>a gestational sac or an afterbirth.</b>",
            "Rava infers: <b>And yet</b> the miscarriage of <b>a gestational sac in</b> the case of a large <b>animal does not exempt</b> the animal’s subsequent offspring from being counted a firstborn. <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Yehoshua and the Rabbis applies <b>in</b> a case where the amniotic fluid is <b>clear,</b> it is <b>due to that</b> reason that the mishna differentiates between a large animal and a woman with regard to a gestational sac.",
            "Rava explains: <b>With regard to a woman, as the</b> aforementioned <b>verse:</b> “And the Lord God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins,” <b>includes</b> in the definition of offspring a gestational sac, i.e., skin, one can say that such <b>a gestational sac exempts</b> subsequent births from the obligations of primogeniture.

Evidently, the dispute applies in a case where the amniotic fluid is clear.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Do you hold</b> that <b>it is obvious to Rabbi Yehoshua</b> that a gestational sac in which the amniotic fluid is turbid has the halakhic status of an offspring? That is not so; rather, <b>Rabbi Yehoshua is uncertain</b> of its halakhic status, <b>and</b> therefore <b>here,</b> in this case, he rules <b>stringently, and there</b> he also rules <b>stringently.</b>",
            "The Gemara elaborates: First of all, <b>with regard to</b> a situation where <b>a woman</b> discharged a gestational sac in which the amniotic fluid was turbid, in <b>which</b> case the obligation of primogeniture <b>is a monetary matter,</b> i.e., the obligation to redeem the newborn child by paying money to a priest, the subsequent births are exempt, in accordance with the principle that <b>uncertainty</b> with regard to <b>monetary matters</b> is treated <b>leniently.</b>",
            "By contrast, <b>with regard to an animal,</b> in <b>which</b> case firstborn status <b>is a ritual matter, as there are</b> prohibitions <b>involving,</b> i.e., against, <b>shearing</b> the animal’s wool <b>and</b> using the animal for <b>labor</b> before it incurs a blemish, the discharged gestational sac is not considered an offspring and does not exempt subsequent births from the obligations of firstborn status, as <b>uncertainty</b> with regard to <b>ritual matters</b> is treated <b>stringently. So too, with regard to</b> the impurity of <b>a woman</b> who discharged a gestational sac, she is deemed impure, as <b>uncertainty</b> with regard to <b>impurity</b> is treated <b>stringently,</b> which means that for the purposes of this <i>halakha</i> a gestational sac is considered an offspring.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And is</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>uncertain</b> about the <i>halakha</i> of a woman who discharges a gestational sac? <b>But doesn’t he cite a verse</b> as proof that the woman has the impurity of one who gave birth?

            "<b>Rav Ami bar Shmuel says:</b> This matter was <b>explained to me by Mar Shmuel:</b> As for <b>being concerned</b> that perhaps she is impure, the woman must be <b>concerned,</b> due to the uncertainty whether she discharged an offspring.

            "There is a different dispute between Rabbi Shimon and the Rabbis that <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 2:2): If a house contains <b>a ladleful of dirt from a cemetery and</b> slightly <b>more,</b> the house <b>is impure; and Rabbi Shimon deems</b> it <b>pure.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of the Rabbis?</b> The Gemara answers: They deem the house impure <b>as it is impossible for</b> slightly <b>more than a ladleful of dirt from a cemetery not to contain a ladleful of dust</b> from a corpse.",

            "<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan follows his</b> line of <b>reasoning</b> in this regard, <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov</b> both <b>said the same thing,</b> i.e., they both issued rulings based on the same principle. The relevant statement of <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> is <b>that which we said,</b> i.e., that if a woman discharged an afterbirth the house is pure, as the offspring is nullified by the blood that emerged during the miscarriage. <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> ben Ya’akov said that <b>which is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Bekhorot</i> 21a): <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> In the case of <b>a large animal that expelled a mass of</b> congealed <b>blood, that</b> mass <b>must be buried,</b> as perhaps there was a male fetus there, which was consecrated as a firstborn when it emerged, <b>and</b> the animal <b>is exempt from</b> having any future offspring being counted <b>a firstborn.</b>",
            "<b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to that</b> <i>halakha</i>: The mass of congealed blood <b>does not impart ritual impurity, neither through</b> physical <b>contact nor through carrying</b> it.

The Gemara asks: <b>But since</b> the mass <b>does not impart impurity, neither through contact nor through carrying,</b> which indicates that it is not considered a fetus, <b>why</b> must it be <b>buried?</b> The Gemara answers: It must be buried <b>in order to publicize that</b> the animal <b>is exempt from</b> having its future offspring being counted <b>a firstborn.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: If the animal’s subsequent offspring is not counted a firstborn, <b>evidently</b> the mass <b>is</b> treated like <b>a full-fledged offspring.

Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is <b>due to</b> the halakhic <b>nullification</b> of a foreign substance <b>in a majority</b> of permitted substances that the Sages <b>touched upon it,</b> to exclude it from impurity through contact or carrying. In other words, the fetus is considered a full-fledged offspring, but it does not impart impurity, because it is nullified by the rest of the congealed mass.",
            "§ The Gemara resumes its discussion of the opinion of Rabbi Shimon that if a woman discharges an afterbirth in a house, the house is pure. <b>Rabbi Ami says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: And Rabbi Shimon concedes that its mother is impure</b> with the impurity of a woman after <b>childbirth.</b>",
            "<b>A certain elder said to Rabbi Ami: I will explain to you the reason</b> for the statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan.

This indicates that <b>even</b> if a woman <b>gives birth to</b> an offspring that is <b>similar only to the seed that she bore,</b> i.e., if the offspring liquefied and became similar to semen, the woman is <b>impure</b> with the impurity of a woman after <b>childbirth.</b>",

            "The Gemara explains why one cannot infer from here that a deformed corpse does not impart impurity to other items that are under the same roof: <b>On the contrary,</b> one can <b>infer from</b> this statement <b>in</b> the opposite <b>manner: It is</b> only because <b>the form of</b> the corpse still <b>exists that</b> the Sages <b>deemed pure</b> the <b>small openings</b> of the house; <b>but otherwise,</b> the <b>small openings are also impure, as each and every one</b> of them <b>is fit for taking out</b> the corpse through them, <b>each limb one</b> by <b>one.</b> Consequently, no proof can be derived from this statement in support of the opinion of Reish Lakish.",

            "<b>Rav Ḥisda and Rabba bar Rav Huna both say:</b> Although the woman observes the period of impurity of a woman after childbirth, <b>we do not give her</b> the <b>days of purity</b> following the period of impurity. <b>What is the reason?</b> Although it is presumed that the discharged limbs came from a full-fledged fetus, it is unknown whether or when the woman discharged the rest of the fetus, and the principle is that a woman who discharges observes her periods of impurity and purity when the majority of the limbs of the fetus emerge. Therefore, one can <b>say</b> that perhaps <b>her childbirth was distant,</b> i.e., the woman discharged the majority of the limbs of the fetus long before she discharged this hand or foot, and consequently her period of purity has already ended.",

It might be thought that perhaps the woman did not give birth at all and is not obligated to bring the offering, and therefore her bird sin offering cannot be eaten.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary</b> for the mishna to state this <i>halakha</i>, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>since Rabbi Yitzḥak says</b> that the sex of a fetus is determined at the moment of conception, in that if the <b>woman emits seed first she gives birth to a male,</b> and if the <b>man emits seed first she gives birth to a female,</b> therefore one might <b>say</b> that <b>since this</b> offspring that was born with the <i>tumtum</i> or hermaphrodite <b>is male, that</b> <i>tumtum</i> or hermaphrodite <b>is also male.</b> Consequently, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that the woman shall observe the strictures of a woman who gave birth to a female as well, as one can <b>say</b> that perhaps <b>both</b> the man and the woman <b>emitted seed at the same time,</b> which would mean that <b>this</b> offspring <b>is male and that</b> <i>tumtum</i> or hermaphrodite <b>is female.</b>",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rav,</b> who holds that an impure <i>tumtum</i> or hermaphrodite is not liable for entering the Temple but that any <i>teruma</i> that he touches is burned, <b>what is different</b> with regard to <b>entering the Temple,</b> for <b>which</b> he is <b>not</b> liable? The reason it is different is <b>that it is written: “Both male and female you shall send out,”</b> from which it is derived that <b>a definite male</b> or <b>a definite female</b> is liable for entering the Temple in a state of impurity, <b>but not a <i>tumtum</i> or a hermaphrodite.</b>",
            "<b>If so, we should not burn <i>teruma</i></b> that he touches either, <b>as it is written</b> in a verse dealing with these types of impurity: “This is the law of the <i>zav</i>, and of one from whom the flow of semen emerges, so that he is thereby impure; and of her that is sick with her menstrual status, <b>and they who have an issue, whether a male or a female”</b> (Leviticus 15:32–33).

            "The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse <b>is necessary for</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>of Rabbi Yitzḥak, as Rabbi Yitzḥak said:</b> The term <b>“whether a male”</b> serves <b>to include a male leper</b> as a primary source of impurity <b>with regard to the sources of his</b> bodily emissions. In other words, the various emissions of a leper, e.g., his saliva and urine, have the status of a primary source of impurity, and therefore they transmit impurity to a person or utensil that touches them. And the term <b>“or a female”</b> serves <b>to include a female</b> as a primary source of impurity <b>with regard to the sources of her</b> bodily emissions.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>This</b> verse: “Both male and female you shall send out” (Numbers 5:3), from which Rav derives that the prohibition against an impure person entering the Temple does not apply to one whose sex is uncertain, <b>is also necessary</b> for another <i>halakha</i>. That <i>halakha</i> is that the obligation to remove from the Temple any impure person or item applies only <b>to one that has</b> the option of attaining ritual <b>purity</b> by immersing <b>in a ritual bath; this excludes</b> an impure <b>earthenware vessel,</b> which cannot be purified by immersing it in a ritual bath. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei.</b> Consequently, Rav’s <i>halakha</i> cannot be derived from that verse.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> that the verse serves to teach Rabbi Yosei’s <i>halakha</i> alone, <b>let the Merciful One write:</b> Any <b>person</b> you shall send out, as this would also exclude earthenware vessels.

            "With regard to Rav’s <i>halakha</i> that the prohibition of entering the Temple in a state of ritual impurity does not apply to one who is a <i>tumtum</i> or a hermaphrodite, the Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> then even <b>when they become impure with other types of impurity,</b> in addition to the impurity of a <i>zav</i> or a menstruating woman, a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite <b>should</b> likewise <b>not be sent out</b> of the Temple, as the passage from which a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite are excluded is also referring to other types of impurity: “That they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that has an issue, and whatever is impure by the dead” (Numbers 5:2). The Gemara answers: <b>The</b> next <b>verse states: “Both male,”</b> which is referring <b>to impurity</b> caused by a substance <b>that is emitted from the male</b> organ, i.e., <i>ziva</i>.",

            "The Gemara answers: The <i>halakha</i> in <b>the mishna</b> is referring <b>to</b> a case <b>where</b> the woman <b>had not been presumed</b> to be <b>pregnant</b> prior to her miscarriage; <b>and when Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says</b> that a woman who discharges is presumed to have discharged an offspring, he was speaking of a case <b>where</b> the woman <b>had been presumed</b> to be <b>pregnant</b> prior to her miscarriage.",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a difficulty with regard to the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi from a <i>baraita</i>: There is the case of a kosher <b>animal</b> that had not yet given birth, <b>which went</b> to the pasture <b>full,</b> i.e., pregnant, <b>and came</b> back the same day <b>empty,</b> i.e., with no live offspring.It clearly discharged, but it is unknown whether or not it discharged an offspring, which would exempt the animal’s subsequent offspring from the status of a firstborn. In this case, the offspring <b>that comes after it</b> is <b>a firstborn</b> of <b>uncertain</b> status.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But why</b> is this the <i>halakha</i>? According to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, one should <b>follow</b> the reality among <b>the majority of animals, and the majority of animals give birth to full-fledged offspring.

            "<b>Ravina says</b> in response: In this case, the <i>halakha</i> does not follow the majority of animals, <b>because it can be said</b> that <b>the majority of animals give birth to an item that exempts</b> the animal’s subsequent offspring <b>from firstborn</b> status, <b>but a minority of</b> animals <b>give birth to an item that does not exempt</b> the animal’s subsequent offspring <b>from firstborn</b> status, i.e., an item that is not a full-fledged offspring. <b>And</b> an additional factor is that <b>all</b> animals <b>that give birth</b> to full-fledged offspring <b>discharge turbid liquids</b> one day before giving birth, <b>and since this</b> animal <b>did not discharge turbid liquids</b> before going to the pasture, <b>the</b> effect of the <b>majority is undermined.</b> Consequently, the status of the animal’s birth is uncertain, and for this reason its subsequent offspring is considered a firstborn of uncertain status.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If all</b> animals <b>that give birth</b> to full-fledged offspring <b>discharge turbid liquids</b> before giving birth, then it should be concluded <b>from</b> the fact <b>that this</b> animal <b>did not discharge turbid liquids</b> that it did not discharge a full-fledged offspring, and therefore the animal’s subsequent offspring <b>is a proper firstborn,</b> not a firstborn of uncertain status. <b>Rather,</b> one should <b>say</b> that Ravina meant the following: <b>The majority of</b> animals that <b>give birth discharge turbid liquids</b> beforehand, <b>and</b> therefore, <b>since this</b> animal <b>did not discharge turbid liquids, the</b> effect of the <b>majority is undermined.</b>",

            "The Gemara further inquires: As explained above, the reason it is prohibited for the woman to engage in intercourse during the third week is that she might have given birth just before arriving and had been a <i>zava</i> at the time, and therefore after observing the two weeks of impurity of a woman after childbirth, she must observe an additional seven days of impurity as a <i>zava</i>.

The woman must therefore immerse on every night of the third week, in case that night is the end of her period of purity, for a total of thirty-five immersions by the end of the week.

The Gemara responds: <b>Since we implement a conspicuous marker with regard to the blood of</b> a gentile woman, i.e., it is clear that her status is different from that of a Jewish woman in that her blood does not impart impurity whatsoever, everyone <b>will know that</b> the impurity of <b>her saliva and her urine</b> is only <b>by rabbinic</b> law, and there is no concern that people might come to mistakenly burn <i>teruma</i> that comes into contact with the saliva and urine of a gentile <i>zava</i>.",

The Gemara therefore asks: <b>Is this to say that any</b> woman <b>who experiences</b> an emission due to labor <b>pains is a menstruating woman?</b> But if a woman experiences an emission due to labor pains in the eleven days of <i>ziva</i>, she is not rendered a <i>zava</i>, nor can this render her a menstruating woman.",
            "<b>Rav said:</b> It is correct that a woman who experiences an emission of blood due to labor during the eleven days of <i>ziva</i> is not rendered a <i>zava</i>, or even a lesser <i>zava</i>, who must observe one clean day for the day she experienced an emission. But she is <b>a menstruating woman for</b> one <b>day,</b> i.e., she is prohibited to her husband on the day of the emission, and in the evening she may immerse and become permitted to him. <b>And Shmuel said:</b> It is a rabbinic decree that she must observe a clean day, as <b>we are concerned lest she rest</b> from labor and thereby be rendered a lesser <i>zava</i>, as the cessation of pangs would indicate that her emission was not due to her imminent labor.",
            "<b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak said:</b> A woman <b>who experiences</b> labor <b>pains</b> during the eleven days of <i>ziva</i> <b>is nothing,</b> i.e., she is completely pure and is permitted to her husband. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in the mishna that a woman <b>who experiences</b> labor <b>pains</b> is <b>a menstruating woman?</b> This apparently includes all women who experience an emission due to labor, even if it occurs during the eleven days of <i>ziva</i>.",
            "<b>Rava said:</b> The mishna means that if she experienced an emission due to labor <b>during the days of menstruation,</b> she is considered <b>a menstruating woman;</b> if she experienced the emission <b>during the days of <i>ziva</i>,</b> she is <b>pure. And it is taught</b> likewise in a <i>baraita</i>: A woman <b>who experiences</b> labor <b>pains during the days of menstruation</b> is a menstruating woman; if she experiences them <b>during the days of <i>ziva</i>,</b> she is <b>pure.</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>How</b> so, i.e., when does an emission during the eleven days of <i>ziva</i> render a woman one who gives birth as a <i>zava</i>? If <b>she experienced</b> labor <b>pains</b> for <b>one day and</b> then <b>rested</b> from labor for <b>two</b> days, and she experienced an emission on all three days; <b>or</b> if <b>she experienced</b> labor <b>pains</b> for <b>two</b> days <b>and rested</b> from labor for <b>one day,</b> and she experienced bleeding on all three days; <b>or</b> if <b>she rested</b> from labor for one day <b>and she</b> then <b>experienced</b> labor <b>pains</b> for one day, <b>and again rested</b> from labor for one day, and she experienced bleeding on all three days; in each of these cases <b>this</b> woman <b>is</b> considered <b>one who gives birth as a <i>zava</i>,</b> as the cessation of labor pains indicates that the emission of blood is not due to her imminent labor.",
            "<b>But</b> if she <b>rested</b> from labor for <b>one day and</b> then <b>experienced</b> labor <b>pains</b> for <b>two</b> days; <b>or</b> if <b>she rested</b> from labor for <b>two</b> days <b>and experienced</b> labor <b>pains</b> for <b>one day; or</b> if <b>she experienced</b> labor <b>pains</b> for one day <b>and</b> then <b>rested</b> from labor for one day, <b>and again experienced</b> labor <b>pains</b> for one day; <b>this</b> woman <b>is not</b> considered <b>one who gives birth as a <i>zava</i>,</b> since the labor pains indicate that the blood is due to her imminent labor. This is <b>the principle of the matter:</b> If she experienced labor <b>pains adjacent to</b> giving <b>birth, this</b> woman <b>is not</b> considered <b>one who gives birth as a <i>zava</i>;</b> if she was <b>resting</b> from labor <b>adjacent to</b> giving <b>birth, this</b> woman <b>is</b> considered <b>one who gives birth as a <i>zava</i>.</b>",

            "The Gemara asks: The statement that this is <b>the principle of the matter</b> serves <b>to add what?</b> The Gemara answers: It serves <b>to add</b> the ruling <b>of Ḥananya,</b> son of Rabbi Yehoshua’s brother, that for a woman to be considered one who gives birth as a <i>zava</i>, she must have rested from labor for the entire third day.",
            "§ The mishna teaches that if a woman experiences bleeding due to labor pains during the eleven days of <i>ziva</i> she is not considered a <i>zava</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to a <i>zava</i>: “And if a woman has an issue of her blood many days” (Leviticus 15:25). The term <b>“her blood”</b> indicates that only <b>her blood</b> that comes <b>due to herself</b> is impure as blood of <i>ziva</i>, <b>but not</b> blood that comes <b>due to</b> her <b>child.</b>",
            "The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Do you say</b> the verse excludes blood that comes <b>due to</b> her <b>child? Or</b> is it <b>only</b> excluding blood that comes <b>due to circumstances beyond</b> her <b>control? When</b> the verse <b>states: “And if a woman has an issue of her blood,”</b> the inclusion of <i>ziva</i> due to <b>circumstances beyond</b> her <b>control is</b> already <b>stated</b> in the inclusive phrase: Has an issue. If so, <b>how do I realize</b> the meaning of the term <b>“her blood”?</b> The verse is teaching that only <b>her blood</b> that comes <b>due to herself</b> is impure as blood of <i>ziva</i>, <b>but not</b> blood that comes <b>due to</b> her <b>child.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> given that the verse contains both an inclusion and an exclusion, <b>what did you see to deem pure</b> the blood emitted due to <b>the child, and to deem impure</b> the blood she sees <b>due to circumstances beyond</b> her <b>control?</b> Perhaps the opposite is the case, that blood emitted due to circumstances beyond her control is pure, whereas blood caused by labor is impure. The Gemara answers: <b>I deem pure</b> the blood emitted <b>due to the child, as there is</b> a period of <b>purity after it,</b> i.e., her days of purity following her days of impurity; <b>and I deem impure</b> the blood she sees <b>due to circumstances beyond</b> her <b>control, as there is no</b> period of <b>purity after it.</b>",
            "The Gemara objects: <b>On the contrary, I</b> should <b>deem</b> the blood <b>pure in</b> a case where it was emitted due to <b>circumstances beyond</b> her <b>control, as</b> an emission of <i>ziva</i> due <b>to circumstances beyond</b> one’s <b>control</b> in the case <b>of</b> a male <b><i>zav</i> is pure.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Now, in any event, we are dealing with</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a woman, and in</b> the case of <b>a woman we do not find</b> that an emission caused by <b>circumstances beyond</b> her <b>control</b> is pure. It is therefore preferable to deem impure an emission caused by circumstances beyond her control, and to deem pure an emission due to childbirth.",
            "The Gemara adds: <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>What is your opinion, that</b> one should <b>deem</b> the blood <b>pure in</b> a case where it was emitted due to <b>circumstances beyond</b> her <b>control, and deem</b> the blood <b>impure</b> in a case where it was emitted <b>due to the child?</b> But <b>you have no greater</b> instance of <b>circumstances beyond</b> her <b>control than this,</b> the experience of labor pains.",
            "The Gemara objects: <b>If</b> it is <b>so</b> that the above verse is interpreted in such a manner, then in the case <b>a menstruating woman as well,</b> with regard to whom the verse states: “And a woman, if she has an issue, and her issue in her flesh is blood, she shall be in her menstruation seven days” (Leviticus 15:19), <b>let us say</b> that when the verse states <b>“her issue”</b> this indicates that only <b>her issue</b> that comes <b>due to herself</b> renders her a menstruating woman, <b>but not</b> an issue that comes <b>due to</b> her <b>child.</b>",
            "The Gemara elaborates: <b>Do you say</b> that the verse excludes an issue that comes due to her <b>child? Or</b> is it excluding <b>only</b> an issue that comes due to <b>circumstances beyond</b> her <b>control? When</b> the verse <b>states: “And a woman if she has an issue,”</b> the inclusion of an issue due to <b>circumstances beyond</b> her <b>control is</b> already <b>stated.</b> If so, <b>how do I realize</b> the meaning of the term <b>“her issue”?</b> The verse is teaching that only <b>her issue</b> that comes <b>due to herself</b> renders her a menstruating woman, <b>but not</b> an issue that comes <b>due to</b> her <b>child.</b> If the verse can be interpreted in this manner, why does the <i>baraita</i> teach that a woman who experiences labor pains during the days of menstruation is considered a menstruating woman?",
            "<b>Reish Lakish said:</b> The <b>verse states</b> with regard to the days of purity after childbirth: <b>“She shall observe</b> the blood of purity” (Leviticus 12:5). This indicates that <b>you have another</b> instance of an <b>observance that is like this one,</b> i.e., where the woman is not rendered impure by an emission of blood. <b>And which</b> is <b>this</b> other case? <b>This</b> is the case of blood that is emitted due to labor <b>pains during</b> the eleven <b>days of <i>ziva</i>.</b> An emission during the days of menstruation, by contrast, renders the woman a menstruating woman. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that <b>this</b> other case is where a woman has an emission of blood due to labor <b>pains during the days of menstruation,</b> not where she experiences an emission during the days of <i>ziva</i>.",
            "<b>Rather, Shmuel’s father said</b> the <b>verse states: “And she shall be impure two weeks, as in her menstruation”</b> (Leviticus 12:5), <b>and not: As in her <i>ziva</i>. By inference,</b> one may conclude <b>that</b> there is an instance in which an emission of blood that occurs during <b>her</b> days of <b><i>ziva</i></b> is <b>pure. And which</b> case is <b>this? This</b> is the case of blood that is emitted due to labor <b>pains during</b> the eleven <b>days of <i>ziva</i>.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And now that it is written: “And she shall be impure two weeks as in her menstruation,” why do I</b> need the term <b>“her blood”</b> (Leviticus 15:25) from which it is likewise derived that blood emitted due to labor pains during the eleven days of <i>ziva</i> is pure? The Gemara answers: <b>If not</b> for the term <b>“her blood,” I would say</b> the verse is teaching that a woman who gives birth is impure <b>as in her menstruation, and not as in her <i>ziva</i>, and</b> therefore, <b>even</b> if she experienced bleeding during her days of <i>ziva</i> <b>in</b> a state of <b>resting</b> from labor pains, she remains pure. Consequently, the term “her blood” <b>teaches us</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies only if she experiences bleeding due to labor pains.",
            "§ According to Rav, a woman who emits blood during the eleven days of <i>ziva</i> due to labor pains is considered like a menstruating woman for that day, i.e., she is prohibited to her husband until she immerses in the evening. The Gemara relates that <b>Sheila bar Avina ruled</b> in an actual <b>case in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav.</b> The Gemara further relates that <b>when Rav was dying, he said to Rav Asi: Go</b> and <b>hide</b> this <i>halakha</i>, i.e., inform Sheila bar Avina that my ruling is incorrect. <b>And if he does not listen</b> to you, <b>drag him [<i>garyei</i>]</b> to your side with convincing claims. Rav Asi misheard and <b>thought</b> that Rav <b>said to him <i>gadyei</i>,</b> excommunicate him.",
            "<b>After Rav died,</b> Rav Asi went to Sheila bar Avina and <b>said to him: Retract your</b> ruling, <b>as Rav</b> himself <b>retracted his</b> opinion.

Consequently, Sheila bar Avina <b>did not listen</b> to Rav Asi. Rav Asi <b>excommunicated him,</b> as he thought that this was Rav’s instruction. Sheila bar Avina <b>said to</b> Rav Asi: <b>But is the Master not afraid of the fire,</b> i.e., of a punishment for offending me?",
            "Rav Asi <b>said to him,</b> linking in a fanciful manner his own name to the various names of an important <i>tanna</i>: <b>I am Isi ben Yehuda, who is Isi ben Gur Arye, who is Isi ben Gamliel, who is Isi ben Mahalalel,</b> and this name alludes to <b>a copper mortar [<i>asita</i>], over which rot has no power,</b> i.e., no harm will befall me. Sheila bar Avina <b>said to</b> Rav Asi: <b>And I am Sheila bar Avina,</b> and my father’s name alludes to <b>an iron pestle [<i>bukhna</i>], which smashes a copper mortar,</b> i.e., harm may befall you through the merit of my ancestors.",
            "The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Asi fell ill</b> and contracted one sickness after another, so that when <b>he entered the heat</b> of a fever, <b>he exited</b> a sickness where he felt <b>cold,</b> and when <b>he entered into</b> a sickness where he felt <b>cold, he exited the heat</b> of a fever.

        [
            "Immediately upon Rav Asi’s death, <b>Sheila</b> bar Avina <b>went</b> and <b>said to his wife: Prepare for me provisions [<i>zevadata</i>],</b> i.e., shrouds for my burial, as I will soon die.

            "§ The mishna teaches that a woman who experiences an emission of blood due to labor pains is not rendered a <i>zava</i> if she sees the blood in days when she can become a <i>zava</i>, but rather a menstruating woman if she sees the blood on days during which she can be a menstruating woman. In this regard <b>Rava raises a dilemma:</b> In general, if a <i>zava</i> experiences an emission of blood while counting seven clean days, her count is negated and she must begin a new count of seven clean days. But <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a <i>zava</i> who experienced an emission of blood due to labor <b>pains?</b> Does this emission <b>negate</b> her count <b>with regard to <i>ziva</i>?</b>",
            "Rava elaborates: Does every <b>substance that imparts impurity negate</b> the count of seven clean days? If so, as <b>this</b> emission <b>imparts impurity like</b> blood of <b>the days of menstruation,</b> it negates her count as well. <b>Or perhaps</b> only <b>a substance that causes</b> a woman to become a <i>zava</i> <b>negates</b> her count, <b>and</b> as <b>this</b> blood <b>is not</b> a substance that <b>causes</b> her to become a <i>zava</i> it does not negate her count.",
            "<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: The case of an emission <b>of <i>ziva</i></b> due to <b>circumstances beyond</b> one’s <b>control will prove</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to this dilemma, <b>as</b> such an emission <b>does not cause</b> one to be rendered a <i>zav</i>, <b>and</b> yet <b>it negates</b> one’s count of seven clean days.",
            "Rava <b>said to him:</b> This is <b>not so [<i>la’ei</i>],</b> as <b>this</b> emission of <i>ziva</i> due to circumstances beyond one’s control <b>is also</b> a substance that <b>causes</b> one to be rendered a <i>zav</i>, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Zavim</i> 2:2): With regard to a man who <b>saw a first sighting</b> of <i>ziva</i>, <b>one examines him</b> to determine whether the discharge was caused by circumstances beyond his control. After the <b>second</b> sighting of <i>ziva</i> as well, <b>one examines him.</b> But after the <b>third</b> sighting <b>one does not examine him,</b> as even if the third sighting occurred due to circumstances beyond his control he is nevertheless rendered a <i>zav</i> on its account.",
            "Abaye asked Rava: <b>And according to Rabbi Eliezer, who said: Even</b> after <b>the third</b> discharge <b>one examines him,</b> will you <b>indeed</b> say that <b>since</b> an emission of <i>ziva</i> due to circumstances beyond one’s control <b>does not cause</b> one to be rendered a <i>zav</i>, <b>it does not negate</b> his count?

            "The Gemara attempts to reject Rava’s explanation of the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Even</b> after <b>the third</b> discharge <b>one examines him</b> to establish whether he must bring an offering, but after <b>the fourth</b> discharge <b>one does not examine him. What, is it not</b> correct to say that as he was already rendered a <i>zav</i> after three discharges, an examination after the fourth discharge is <b>for</b> the matter of <b>negating</b> any clean days counted thus far? If so, Rabbi Eliezer maintains that an emission of <i>ziva</i> due to circumstances beyond one’s control negates one’s count.",
            "The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No,</b> it is possible that the purpose of the examination after the fourth discharge is to determine whether <b>to render impure that drop</b> of <i>ziva</i> such that it imparts impurity <b>through carrying.</b> According to Rabbi Eliezer, the discharge of a <i>zav</i> imparts impurity through carrying, even if the discharge occurred due to circumstances beyond his control.",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another <i>baraita</i>: <b>With regard to the third</b> discharge, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that <b>one examines him,</b> but after <b>the fourth</b> discharge <b>one does not examine him.</b> The reason is as <b>I said,</b> that the purpose of these examinations is <b>to</b> determine liability to bring <b>an offering, and</b> they do <b>not</b> pertain <b>to</b> the matter of <b>negating</b> any clean days counted thus far. Since the fourth sighting does not affect liability to bring an offering there is no need for an examination.

            "The Gemara concedes: <b>Rather, according to Rabbi Eliezer,</b> one can <b>resolve</b> the dilemma and conclude <b>that</b> even <b>a substance that does not cause</b> one to be rendered a <i>zav</i> <b>negates</b> one’s count.

            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear that</b> which <b>the father of Rabbi Avin teaches</b> with regard to the question of why a discharge of <i>ziva</i> causes a <i>zav</i> to negate his entire count of clean days, whereas a seminal emission negates only the day of the emission itself: <b>What</b> did <b>his <i>ziva</i> cause for him?</b> An impurity of <b>seven</b> days. <b>Therefore,</b> a discharge of <i>ziva</i> causes him to <b>negate</b> his count of <b>seven</b> clean days.

            "The Gemara analyzes this statement: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the claim that <i>ziva</i> causes an impurity of <b>seven</b> days? <b>If we say</b> it means merely <b>that</b> <i>ziva</i> <b>renders him impure</b> for <b>seven</b> days, then the father of Rabbi Avin <b>should have</b> stated: <b>Just as his <i>ziva</i></b> causes him to be impure for <b>seven</b> days, so too, it negates his count of seven clean days. <b>Rather, is it not</b> that the mention of causation indicates that this is what he is saying: <b>A substance that causes</b> one to be rendered a <i>zav</i> <b>negates</b> one’s count of seven clean days, whereas <b>a substance that does not cause</b> one to be rendered a <i>zav</i>, e.g., an emission of blood due to labor pains, <b>does not negate</b> one’s count. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>conclude from it</b> that this is the opinion of the Rabbis.",
            "With regard to the <i>halakha</i>, <b>Abaye said: We have a tradition</b> that blood emitted by a woman due to labor <b>pains does not negate</b> the seven clean days <b>of <i>ziva</i>,</b> in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis. <b>And if you a find <i>tanna</i> who said</b> that it does <b>negate</b> them, the statement of <b>that</b> <i>tanna</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer.</b>",

            "In this regard, <b>a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If <b>she rested from</b> both <b>this and that,</b> from labor pains and emissions of blood, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> that as she rested from labor pains it is evident that the emissions of blood were not due to her imminent labor, and she is <b>ritually impure.

The lack of soldiers before the arrival of the king indicates that they are not in fact soldiers of the king. Likewise, the cessation of labor pains before the birth indicates that the previous emissions of blood were not due to her imminent labor. She is therefore rendered a <i>zava</i>.",

The Gemara answers: In their opinion, <b>that</b> term <b>is necessary to obligate</b> the mother to bring an offering <b>for each and every son</b> to whom she gives birth, rather than one offering after having given birth to several sons; <b>and likewise to obligate</b> her to bring an offering <b>for each and every daughter</b> to whom she gives birth.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> from where does <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers that <b>he derives it from</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>that a <i>tanna</i> taught before Rav Sheshet:</b> The verse states: <b>“This is the law for one who gives birth,</b> whether to a male or a female” (Leviticus 12:7). This <b>teaches that</b> a woman <b>brings a single offering for many offspring</b> born within a short time, e.g., after a multiple birth. One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>she may bring</b> an offering <b>for</b> her <b>childbirth and</b> an offering <b>for</b> an irregular <b>discharge</b> of blood from the uterus [<i>ziva</i>], in a case where she is required to bring one, <b>as one,</b> i.e., that she may fulfill her two obligations with a single offering.",
            "The Gemara interrupts the <i>baraita</i> to raise a difficulty: <b>But</b> how could it possibly enter your mind that a woman may bring one offering for two obligations? In the case of <b>a woman after childbirth who consumed blood, or a woman after childbirth who ate</b> forbidden <b>fat,</b> is <b>one offering sufficient for her?</b> One who eats blood or forbidden fat is obligated to bring a sin offering for atonement (see Leviticus 7:25–27). There is no reason to think that a woman after childbirth, who is required to bring a sin offering for a reason other than her childbirth, may bring one offering for both obligations. Similarly, there are no grounds for suggesting that a single offering might suffice for both childbirth and <i>ziva</i>.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the statement of the <i>baraita</i> should be revised, as follows: One <b>might</b> have thought that a woman <b>may bring</b> an offering <b>for a childbirth that</b> occurred <b>before the completion</b> of her term of postpartum purity, <b>and for</b> a second <b>childbirth that</b> happened <b>after the completion</b> of that period, <b>as one,</b> i.e., she may fulfill her two obligations with a single offering. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “This</b> is the law for one who gives birth” (Leviticus 12:7), indicating that each birth, unless it occurred within the period of purity following another birth, requires its own offering. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis</b> respond to this derivation? The Gemara answers that in their opinion, <b>even though it is written: “This</b> is the law,” <b>it was</b> still <b>necessary</b> for the verse to state: <b>“For a son, or for a daughter.”</b>",
            "The Gemara explains: Had the Torah stated only the verse: “This is the law,” it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that one offering does not suffice for two births that occurred as a result <b>of two pregnancies,</b> as the second one was a miscarriage whose conception occurred during the woman’s period of purity following the first birth. <b>But</b> if both births occurred as a result <b>of one pregnancy, such as</b> in the case of <b>Yehuda and Ḥizkiyya,</b> the twin <b>sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> who were born three months apart (see 27a), <b>I would say that one offering</b> for both births is <b>sufficient for her.</b> Therefore, the verse “for a son, or for a daughter” <b>teaches us</b> otherwise.",

            "The Gemara explains how this <i>baraita</i> supports the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan. The <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches, in any event, that</b> an animal <b>born by caesarean section</b> is <b>not</b> fit for sacrifice. <b>What, is it not</b> referring to one who consecrates an animal born by <b>caesarean section</b> and renders it <b>a sacrificial</b> animal? Evidently, although Rabbi Shimon maintains that a human birth by caesarean section has the halakhic status of a regular birth, he concedes that animals born in this manner are unfit for sacrifice. <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Natan, said: No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is dealing <b>with a firstborn</b> animal born by <b>caesarean section,</b> and it is this animal that is disqualified as an offering. A firstborn animal is sacred only if it emerged from the womb.",
            "The Gemara objects to this interpretation of the <i>baraita</i>: How can it be referring to <b>a firstborn</b> animal? The <i>halakha</i> that firstborn status does not apply to an animal born by caesarean section is <b>derived from</b> the phrase <b>“opens the womb,”</b> which teaches that only animals born in the natural manner are endowed with the sanctity of firstborn animals and may be sacrificed on the altar. Since an animal born by caesarean section is not sacred at all, and it is clear that a non-sacred animal cannot be sacrificed upon the altar, it is obvious that the animal must be taken down if it was placed there in error.",
            "The Gemara responds to this objection: <b>Rather, what</b> would you say? Would you say that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to an ordinary animal, not a firstborn, <b>that</b> had been consecrated as <b>a sacrificial</b> animal? But this animal is not sacred either, as <b>derived from</b> the verbal analogy of the term <b>“its mother”</b> stated with regard to the firstborn and the term <b>“its mother”</b> stated in connection with consecrated animals, as Rabbi Yoḥanan taught earlier. If one seeks to consecrate as an offering an animal that was born by caesarean section, it is not rendered sacred at all. Accordingly, the same reasoning applies as before: It is evident that a non-sacred animal may not be placed on the altar, and it must be removed if placed there in error.",
            "The Gemara rejects this response: <b>What is this</b> comparison between firstborn animals and consecrated animals? <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to animals <b>that are consecrated</b> to be offerings, <b>that is why two verses are necessary: One</b> verse, the verbal analogy between consecrated animals and firstborn animals, teaches <b>that a non-sacred animal</b> whose mother <b>gave birth</b> to it <b>by caesarean section and</b> whose owner subsequently <b>consecrated it</b> as an offering is not sacred at all, and must therefore be removed from the altar if it was placed there in error.",
            "<b>And one</b> verse: “This is the law of the burnt offering; that is the burnt offering that goes up on the pyre upon the altar” (Leviticus 6:2), teaches <b>with regard to a sacrificial animal that gave birth by caesarean section,</b> that although the offspring is sacred by virtue of its mother’s sanctity, it may not be sacrificed and must be removed from the altar if placed there in error. <b>And</b> the <i>tanna</i> of this <i>baraita</i> <b>maintains</b> that the <b>offspring of sacrificial animals are</b> automatically <b>sacred upon their emergence</b> from the womb. <b>But if you say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to a firstborn</b> animal that was born by caesarean section, the <i>halakha</i> that this animal is not sacred <b>is derived from</b> the phrase <b>“opens the womb.”</b>",
            "The Gemara adds: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> to interpret the <i>baraita</i> in this manner, that it is referring to an offspring born to a sacrificial animal by caesarean section, <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that <b>an animal that copulated with a person, and an animal that was the object of bestiality, and</b> an animal <b>that</b> was <b>set aside</b> for idol worship, <b>and</b> an animal <b>that was worshipped</b> as a deity, <b>and</b> an animal that is an offspring of <b>diverse kinds,</b> must all be removed from the altar if placed there in error.",

The word “or” in the expression <b>“or from the flock”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> an animal <b>that gored</b> a person, killing him.

            "<b>And furthermore,</b> is the disqualification of an animal born of a mixture of <b>diverse kinds derived from here?</b> No, it is <b>derived from elsewhere,</b> as taught in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “When <b>a bull or a sheep or a goat</b> is born, it shall be seven days under its mother; but from the eighth day and onward it may be accepted for an offering” (Leviticus 22:27). The term <b>“a bull”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> an offspring of <b>diverse kinds</b> from being used as an offering, The phrase <b>“or a goat”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> an animal that <b>resembles</b> another, i.e., a sheep that is the offspring of sheep but that looks like a goat, or vice versa. Once again, as these animals cannot be consecrated at all, it is not necessary for the Torah to teach that they must be removed from the altar if placed there in error.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>two verses are necessary</b> for each of these cases: <b>One to</b> teach that <b>a non-sacred animal</b> that is subject to any of these disqualifications cannot be consecrated, <b>and</b> the other <b>one to</b> teach that with regard to <b>a sacrificial animal</b> that was born with this status by virtue of its mother’s sanctity, if it is subject to one of these disqualifications it may not be sacrificed and must be removed from the altar if placed there in error. Accordingly, it stands to reason that <b>here too,</b> in the case of an animal born by caesarean section, <b>two verses</b> are <b>necessary</b> for the same reason: One for a non-sacred animal, to teach that it cannot be consecrated, and another for the offspring of a sacrificial animal.",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Shimon</b> in fact <b>hold</b> that <b>it is sufficient for her</b> to be <b>like the man who engaged in intercourse with her?

            "<b>Rather,</b> this verse is necessary <b>because</b> in the case of intercourse the contact with the source of <b>impurity</b> occurs in <b>a concealed part</b> of the body, <b>and</b> contact with <b>impurity</b> by <b>a concealed part</b> of the body generally <b>does not render</b> one <b>impure. But</b> here <b>it is a Torah edict</b> that the woman does become impure in this manner.

Here,</b> this second <i>baraita</i> is dealing <b>with</b> a woman who <b>engages in intercourse,</b> whereas <b>there,</b> the first <i>baraita</i> is dealing <b>with</b> a woman who <b>discharges</b> semen after intercourse. It is only during the act of intercourse that a woman becomes impure due to the semen. If she later discharges semen, she does not become impure, according to Rabbi Shimon, until the semen leaves her body and touches her on the outside.",
            "The Gemara objects: But in the case of a woman who <b>discharges</b> semen, one can <b>derive</b> that she is impure <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that she engaged in intercourse</b> prior to the discharge. The Gemara answers: Rabbi Shimon is referring to a case <b>where she immersed herself,</b> thereby purifying herself <b>from</b> the impurity <b>from her intercourse,</b> and she subsequently discharged semen.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that</b> in the case of a woman who <b>engages in intercourse it is sufficient for her</b> to simply immerse herself, and then she is <b>in</b> a state of <b>impurity</b> only until <b>evening?

            "The Gemara answers: <b>Here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> others <b>immersed</b> the woman while she was still <b>in bed,</b> and she remained there. If she remains lying down, it is possible for her not to discharge semen following intercourse, and the immersion after intercourse purifies her.

            "<b>Rather, according to Rava too,</b> this is referring even to a case <b>where</b> others <b>immersed her</b> while she was still <b>in bed</b> and she remained there for three days. <b>And</b> the contradiction is <b>not difficult: Here,</b> in the statement of Rava, he is referring to a woman <b>who turns around</b> in bed from side to side. It is therefore certain that she will discharge semen over the course of three days. <b>There,</b> in the statement of Rabbi Shimon, he is speaking of a woman lying in bed <b>who does not turn around</b> from side to side. Such a woman will not discharge semen at all.",
            "<b>And</b> the statement of <b>Rava is referring to a verse</b> in the Torah, <b>and this</b> is what <b>he is saying: When the Merciful One writes</b> in the Torah, with regard to a man and woman who engaged in intercourse: <b>“They shall both bathe themselves in water, and be impure until the evening”</b> (Leviticus 15:18), which indicates that when evening comes the woman’s purification is complete, it is dealing with a case <b>where she</b> is in bed and <b>does not turn around</b> from side to side. <b>But</b> in a case <b>where she does turn around, she is prohibited from partaking of <i>teruma</i></b> for <b>the entire three days</b> following the intercourse, <b>as it is impossible for her not to discharge</b> semen throughout this period.",
            "<b>Rav Shmuel bar Bisna asked Abaye:</b> With regard to a woman who <b>discharges semen, is her</b> status that of <b>one who experienced</b> an emission of an impure substance, <b>or is her</b> status that of <b>one who came into contact</b> with an impure substance?",
            "The practical <b>difference</b> between these two possibilities is threefold: Whether or not the discharge <b>negates</b> her counting of seven clean days at the end of the <i>ziva</i> period, whether or not it <b>renders</b> her <b>impure by any amount, and</b> whether or not it <b>renders</b> her <b>impure</b> while still <b>inside</b> her body <b>as</b> it would after emerging <b>out</b> of her body. If it is considered an emission of an impure substance, it negates her count of seven clean days, and it renders her impure even in the slightest amount, and it renders her impure even before it emerges from her body. If it renders her impure because she came into contact with it, it does not negate her count, it renders her impure only if a certain minimum amount emerges, and it renders her impure only after touching the outside of her body.",
            "Before addressing the dilemma, the Gemara raises a difficulty with Rav Shmuel bar Bisna’s question itself: <b>Whichever</b> way <b>you</b> look at it, the question is problematic. <b>If he had heard the <i>baraita</i></b> cited above, the answer is obvious: <b>According to the Rabbis, her status is</b> that of one who <b>experienced</b> an emission of an impure substance, as the <i>baraita</i> clearly states that in the Rabbis’ opinion the woman is rendered impure even before the semen emerges from her body. <b>And according to Rabbi Shimon, her status is</b> that of one who <b>came into contact with</b> the impure substance, as Rabbi Shimon states that the woman is impure only when the semen emerges from her body.",
            "<b>And if</b> Rav Shmuel bar Bisna <b>did not hear the <i>baraita</i></b> and was unaware of it, it <b>is</b> certainly more <b>reasonable</b> to assume that <b>her</b> status should be that of one who <b>came into contact</b> with the semen. Why would he think otherwise, as after all, the emitted substance did not originate in her body?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> Rav Shmuel bar Bisna <b>had heard the <i>baraita</i>, and he did not raise the dilemma according to</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis.</b> According to their opinion it is clear that the woman has the status of one who experienced an emission of an impure bodily substance. Rather, <b>when he raises the dilemma,</b> it is <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon.</b>",
            "<b>And he does not raise the dilemma with regard to</b> the question of whether or not the semen <b>renders</b> her <b>impure</b> when it is <b>inside</b> the body <b>as</b> it would after emerging <b>outside</b> the body, as Rabbi Shimon states explicitly that the woman is impure only when the semen leaves her body. Rather, <b>when he raises the dilemma,</b> it is only with regard to the other two issues mentioned above: Whether or not the discharge <b>negates</b> her counting of seven clean days at the end of the <i>ziva</i> period, <b>and</b> whether or not it <b>renders</b> her <b>impure in any amount.</b> He therefore asked: <b>What</b> is the status of her discharge of semen with respect to these two matters?",
            "The Gemara explains the sides of the dilemma: It is possible that <b>when Rabbi Shimon says: It is sufficient for her</b> to be <b>like the man who engaged in intercourse with her, this statement</b> applies only with regard to the question of whether or not the semen <b>renders</b> her <b>impure</b> when it is <b>inside</b> the body <b>as</b> it would after emerging <b>outside</b> the body.

            "<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> a different explanation of Rav Shmuel bar Bisna’s dilemma: <b>Actually, he did not hear the <i>baraita</i></b> and was unaware of it. <b>And</b> as for the question of why he would think that the woman should have the status of one who experienced an emission of an impure bodily substance, <b>this was his dilemma: Since the Merciful One was stringent</b> before the giving of the Torah <b>on</b> Mount <b>Sinai with regard to</b> men <b>who had experienced a seminal emission,</b> in that they were prohibited from attending that event, as it is stated: “Be ready on the third day; do not come near a woman” (Exodus 19:15), whereas those who had come into contact with other impure items were not prohibited from attending, perhaps the stringency of this particular source of impurity should likewise be applied to a woman who discharges semen. If so, <b>her</b> status should be like one who <b>experienced</b> a seminal emission, rather than one who merely came into contact with semen.",
            "The Gemara explains the other side of the dilemma: <b>Or perhaps we should not derive</b> any <i>halakhot</i> <b>from</b> the instructions given before the revelation at <b>Sinai, as that</b> was <b>a novelty.</b> The Gemara cites a proof for this claim: <b>As</b> that was the case with regard to <b><i>zavin</i> and lepers, whose</b> impurity is even more <b>stringent</b> than that of one who experiences a seminal emission, <b>but</b> nevertheless <b>the Merciful One was not stringent with regard to them,</b> as He permitted them to attend the ceremony of the giving of the Torah.",
            "After clarifying Rav Shmuel bar Bisna’s dilemma, the Gemara cites Abaye’s answer to him. Abaye <b>said to him:</b> The woman’s status <b>is</b> that of one who <b>experienced</b> an emission of semen. Rav Shmuel bar Bisna <b>came</b> and <b>asked Rava</b> the same question, and <b>he</b> too <b>said to him:</b> The woman’s status <b>is</b> that of one who <b>experienced</b> an emission. <b>He came before Rav Yosef,</b> and <b>he</b> too <b>said to him: Her</b> status <b>is</b> that of one who <b>experienced</b> an emission. Rav Shmuel bar Bisna <b>came back to Abaye</b> and <b>said to him: You are all spewing the same saliva.</b> None of you are teaching anything new, as you all repeat the same unsatisfactory answer.",
            "Abaye <b>said to him: I said well to you,</b> i.e., my response was correct. <b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> that <b>it is sufficient for</b> the woman to be <b>like the man who engaged in intercourse with her only with regard to</b> the question of whether or not the semen <b>renders</b> her <b>impure</b> while still <b>inside</b> her body <b>as</b> it would after emerging <b>out</b> of her body.

Therefore, the discharge negates her count and renders her impure by any amount.",
            "§ The Gemara continues to discuss types of ritual impurity that apply whether the impure substance is still inside the body or has been discharged from it. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a menstruating woman, a <i>zava</i>,</b> a woman <b>who observes</b> a clean <b>day for a day</b> she experiences a discharge, <b>and a woman after childbirth, they all become impure</b> while the blood is still <b>inside</b> their bodies just <b>as</b> they would be when the blood emerges <b>outside</b> their bodies.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> with regard to <b>all those</b> other cases, <b>it is well,</b> i.e., one can understand this ruling with regard to blood that has not left the body. <b>But</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a woman after childbirth</b> is puzzling, since <b>if</b> this is referring to blood that she discharges <b>in</b> her <b>days of menstruation,</b> then she is <b>a menstruating woman,</b> and she is included in the earlier category. Likewise, <b>if</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to blood that she discharges <b>in</b> her <b>days of <i>ziva</i>,</b> she has the status of <b><i>ziva</i>,</b> and once again is included in a previously mentioned category.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the mention of a woman after childbirth is <b>necessary</b> only in a case <b>where</b> the days of ritual impurity after childbirth, which are seven for a male and fourteen for a female, have passed, and the woman <b>descended to immerse</b> in a ritual bath in order to emerge <b>from</b> her status of <b>impurity to purity.</b>",
            "<b>And</b> the <i>halakha</i> here is <b>like that which Rabbi Zeira said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ashi said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> In the case of <b>a woman after childbirth who descended to immerse</b> in a ritual bath in order to emerge <b>from</b> her status of <b>impurity to purity, and blood was uprooted from her</b> uterus but it did not leave her body, her status is as follows: If this occurred <b>on</b> her <b>descent</b> to the ritual bath, she remains <b>impure,</b> as the immersion is ineffective. If it happened <b>on</b> her <b>ascent</b> from the bath, she is <b>pure,</b> as her period of purity, which is thirty-three days for a male and sixty-six for a female, has commenced.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said to Rabbi Zeira,</b> with regard to this <i>halakha</i>: If the blood emerged <b>on</b> her <b>descent</b> to immerse, <b>why</b> is she <b>impure?</b> After all, the blood <b>is</b> a substance of <b>impurity</b> that is <b>encapsulated</b> inside a body, and there is a <i>halakha</i> that an encapsulated source of impurity does not impart impurity to other items (see <i>Ḥullin</i> 71a). Rabbi Zeira <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yirmeya: <b>Go</b> and <b>ask Rabbi Avin, as I explained to him</b> the reason for this <i>halakha</i>, <b>and he nodded [<i>vekharkish</i>] his head to me</b> in <b>the study hall,</b> in affirmation of my explanation.",
            "The Gemara relates that Rabbi Yirmeya indeed <b>went</b> and <b>asked</b> Rabbi Avin the reason, and Rabbi Avin <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yirmeya: The Sages <b>rendered</b> this blood <b>like the unslaughtered carcass of a kosher bird, which imparts impurity</b> even <b>to</b> the <b>garments</b> of the one who eats it, when there is an olive-bulk of it <b>in</b> his <b>throat,</b> despite the fact that this source of impurity is encapsulated in his body. Rabbi Yirmeya asked Rabbi Avin: <b>Are</b> these cases <b>comparable?</b> How can one compare the impurity of a woman after childbirth to the impurity of one who eats the unslaughtered carcass of a kosher bird?"
        ],
        [
            "Rabbi Yirmeya elaborates: <b>There,</b> with regard to the impurity contracted by swallowing an unslaughtered bird carcass, this unusual type of impurity <b>does not have</b> an equivalent form of <b>impurity outside,</b> since if one merely touches an unslaughtered bird carcass, he and his garments remain pure. By contrast, <b>here,</b> with regard to the blood of a woman after childbirth, <b>let it become impure</b> only <b>when it emerges outside</b> her body, like all other items that impart impurity by contact once they are no longer encapsulated. Rather, due to this difficulty one must explain that <b>here too,</b> Rabbi Zeira is referring to a case <b>where</b> the blood <b>emerged outside</b> her body after her immersion; otherwise she remains pure.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> the reason that the woman is pure is that the blood <b>emerged outside</b> her body, <b>what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> this <i>halakha</i>? Certainly, this blood renders the woman impure upon contact. The Gemara answers that this ruling is necessary, <b>lest you say: Since</b> the woman’s <b>immersion is effective for</b> any <b>blood that is inside</b> her, i.e., it prevents that blood from rendering her impure, <b>let it also be effective for this</b> blood, which did not leave her body until after the immersion. Therefore, Rabbi Zeira <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the <i>halakha</i>.",
            "The Gemara objects: <b>We have resolved our <i>halakha</i>,</b> the statement of Rabbi Zeira, <b>but</b> the difficulty remains with regard to the case of <b>a woman after childbirth.</b> In light of the explanation of Rabbi Zeira’s opinion, the <i>baraita</i> cited at the beginning of the discussion, which states that a woman after childbirth becomes impure by blood that is still inside her body, cannot be interpreted in accordance with his opinion, as Rabbi Zeira maintains that the blood does not render her impure unless it emerges outside her body. Accordingly, the original difficulty remains: <b>If</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to blood that she discharges <b>in</b> her <b>days of menstruation,</b> then she is <b>a menstruating woman,</b> and <b>if</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to her <b>days of <i>ziva</i>,</b> it has the status of <b><i>ziva</i>,</b> both are which are already listed in the <i>baraita</i>.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>Here we are dealing with a dry birth,</b> without the emission of blood, and the <i>baraita</i> is teaching that the woman is rendered impure despite the fact that no blood emerged. The Gemara asks: If the <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>a dry birth, what</b> blood <b>is there</b> that <b>becomes impure</b> while still <b>inside</b> the woman’s body just <b>as</b> it would when emerging <b>outside</b> her body? There is no blood at all in the case of a dry birth.",
            "The Gemara answers that this clause is not referring to blood; rather, this is a situation <b>where</b> the <b>offspring put his head out of the corridor,</b> in which case it is considered born and renders its mother impure, despite the fact that the rest of its body has not emerged. <b>And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rav Oshaya, as Rav Oshaya said:</b> If a midwife inserted her hand into the womb of a woman whose fetus is dead, she is rendered impure due to contact with a corpse. This is a rabbinic <b>decree lest</b> the midwife touch it after <b>the offspring puts his head out of the corridor</b> and it dies afterward, in which case the fetus is considered born and therefore she would be ritually impure by Torah law.",
            "The Gemara adds: <b>And</b> this is <b>similar to</b> an incident involving <b>a certain</b> man <b>who came before Rava</b> and <b>said to him: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to</b> whether one <b>may circumcise on Shabbat?</b> Rava <b>said to him:</b> One may <b>well</b> do so. <b>After</b> that man <b>left, Rava said</b> to himself, perplexed: Can it <b>enter your mind that that man did not know that</b> it is <b>permitted to circumcise on Shabbat,</b> and he approached me to inquire about such a basic matter?

            "The Gemara explains: <b>What is the</b> practical <b>difference</b> as to whether it is considered encapsulated or concealed?

Rabbi Shimon said: Now what does this verse teach? If it teaches that one who touches semen is rendered impure, this is derived from the verse: “Or a man from whom the flow of seed goes out” (Leviticus 22:4). <b>Rather,</b> it must be teaching that a woman who engages in intercourse is rendered impure by the man’s semen, despite the fact that the semen did not touch her on the outside of her body.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: This is a novelty <b>because</b> the semen <b>is</b> a source of <b>impurity</b> located in <b>a concealed part</b> of the body, <b>and</b> ordinarily contact with a source of <b>impurity</b> by <b>a concealed part</b> of the body <b>does not render</b> one <b>impure. But</b> here <b>it is a Torah edict</b> that the woman does become impure in this manner. Evidently, an impure substance in the vagina is considered located in a concealed part of the body.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And Abaye,</b> how does he respond to Rava’s proof? The Gemara answers that Abaye would explain that the <i>tanna</i> of this <i>baraita</i>, Rabbi Shimon, <b>states one</b> reason <b>and</b> adds <b>another: One</b> reason <b>that</b> this <i>halakha</i> is a novelty is that semen in the vagina <b>is an encapsulated</b> substance of <b>impurity, and another</b> reason is that <b>even if you were to say</b> that the semen <b>is</b> considered located in <b>a concealed part</b> of the body, which ordinarily <b>does not render</b> one <b>impure, but</b> here, <b>it is a Torah edict</b> that the woman does become impure in this manner.",
            "§ A similar <b>dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: With regard to the <b>place</b> in a person’s throat where <b>an unslaughtered carcass of a kosher bird</b> renders him ritually impure, how is it defined? <b>Is</b> the meat of the carcass considered <b>encapsulated, or is it</b> considered located in <b>a concealed part</b> of the body?",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>What is the</b> practical <b>difference?</b> The difference is in a case <b>where another</b> individual <b>inserted an olive-bulk of an animal carcass into his mouth.

            "Abaye and Rava disagree with regard to this issue as well. <b>Abaye said: It is</b> considered <b>encapsulated, and Rava said: It is</b> considered located in <b>a concealed part</b> of the body. <b>Abaye</b> further <b>said: From where do I say</b> that it is considered encapsulated? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>an animal carcass should impart impurity to garments</b> when it is <b>in</b> one’s <b>throat,</b> like an unslaughtered carcass of a kosher bird.

            "The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states:</b> “That which dies of itself, or is torn of animals, he shall not eat to become impure <b>through it,”</b> which indicates that one becomes impure when the item is in the throat only <b>through it,</b> i.e., an unslaughtered carcass of a kosher bird, <b>and not through another,</b> i.e., an animal carcass.",

            "The Gemara explains that this verse is written <b>to provide a measure</b> for the impurity of an animal carcass, but this measure applies only <b>to one who touches and to one who carries</b> it, not to one who eats the carcass.

            "Rava further said: If there was the carcass of <b>a creeping animal in the folds of</b> one’s body, <b>and he brought</b> the creeping animal that was in the fold <b>into the airspace of</b> a large earthenware vessel, such as <b>an oven,</b> the oven is thereby rendered <b>impure,</b> as is the <i>halakha</i> when a creeping animal is placed in its airspace. The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that as <b>the Merciful One states</b> with regard to the impurity of creeping animals: “And any earthenware vessel into <b>whose interior</b> any of them fall, whatever is in it shall be impure, and it you shall break” (Leviticus 11:33), this teaches that impurity applies only if the creeping animal fell inside the vessel itself,"
        ],
        [
            "<b>and not</b> if it was in <b>the interior of its interior,</b> i.e., contained within something else, such as a fold, which is inside the vessel, therefore Rava <b>teaches us</b> that a fold in one’s body is not considered like the interior of the interior of a vessel. Rather, this definition applies only when the carcass of the creeping animal was actually inside another vessel whose opening was outside the oven.",
            "§ The Gemara continues to discuss the folds in the body with regard to ritual impurity. <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> If there was <b>a pole</b> or a stick placed <b>in the folds of</b> an individual impure with the impurity of <b>a <i>zav</i>, and he moved a ritually pure</b> person <b>with it,</b> that individual is <b>pure,</b> despite the fact that a <i>zav</i> imparts impurity by moving an item. If the <b>pole</b> was placed <b>in the folds of one who is pure, and he moved the <i>zav</i> with it,</b> the pure individual is thereby rendered <b>impure,</b> as is the <i>halakha</i> of one who carries a <i>zav</i>.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> that if a <i>zav</i> moved another with a pole in his own folds he does not render the other person impure? <b>As the verse states: “And whoever a <i>zav</i> touches, without having rinsed his hands in water,</b> he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water” (Leviticus 15:11). <b>This is</b> referring to the impurity imparted by <b>the movement of a <i>zav</i>, as we have not found an impurity</b> similar <b>to it in the entire Torah.</b> Only a <i>zav</i> imparts impurity to items by moving them.",
            "<b>And the Merciful One expresses</b> this impurity imparted <b>by</b> movement using <b>the language of touch,</b> in order <b>to say that</b> the <b>moving and touch</b> of a <i>zav</i> <b>are like his hands: Just as there,</b> with regard to the impurity imparted by contact with the hands, it occurs <b>external</b> to the body, <b>so too here,</b> impurity by means of movement applies only to moving an item with the <b>external</b> portions of the body of the <i>zav</i>.",
            "§ The mishna teaches that a woman becomes ritually impure with the flow of blood from the uterus into the vagina, even if it did not leave the woman’s body. <b>But the <i>zav</i> and one who experiences a seminal emission do not become ritually impure</b> until their emission of impurity emerges outside the body. The Gemara explains: This is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a <i>zav</i>, as it is written: “When</b> any man <b>has an issue out of his flesh”</b> (Leviticus 15:2). The verse teaches that a <i>zav</i> is not impure <b>until his issue emerges out of his flesh.</b> With regard to <b>one who experiences a seminal emission,</b> the reason is <b>that it is written: “And if the flow of seed goes out from a man”</b> (Leviticus 15:16), which indicates that the flow must exit his body.",
            "§ The mishna further states that if a priest <b>was partaking of <i>teruma</i> and sensed</b> a quaking in his limbs, indicating that a seminal emission was imminent, he should firmly hold his penis to prevent the emission from leaving his body, and swallow the <i>teruma</i> while ritually pure. The Gemara asks: May one <b>hold</b> his penis? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Anyone who holds</b> his <b>penis and urinates</b> is considered <b>as though he is bringing a deluge to the world,</b> as masturbation was one of the sins that led to the flood?",
            "<b>Abaye said,</b> in resolution of this difficulty, that the mishna is referring to one who holds his penis <b>with a coarse cloth. Rava said: You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the mishna is referring to a priest who holds his penis <b>with a soft cloth,</b> and the reason it is permitted is that <b>once</b> the semen <b>has</b> already <b>been uprooted</b> from his body, it is <b>uprooted,</b> and his subsequent holding of the penis, even with a soft cloth, does not increase the flow of semen. <b>And Abaye</b> prohibits the use of a soft cloth, as he is <b>concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> one might <b>come to increase</b> the emission of semen, due to the contact of this cloth. <b>But Rava is not concerned</b> that one might <b>come to increase</b> the emission.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to the opinion of Rava. <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>To what is this</b> holding of a penis <b>comparable?</b> It is comparable <b>to</b> one who <b>places a finger in</b> his <b>eye,</b> in <b>that as long as</b> the <b>finger</b> is <b>in the eye,</b> the eye <b>will tear and continue to tear.</b> Here too, the priest’s action will lead to an increased emission of semen.",
            "The Gemara answers that <b>Rava</b> would maintain that if the priest’s limbs were not quaking and the semen was coming out in drops, there is indeed a concern that holding the penis might increase the emission. But when he feels his limbs quaking, this concern does not apply. The reason is that <b>any</b> such event, i.e., <b>a heating</b> of the body that leads to a seminal emission <b>and</b> which is <b>then</b> followed by another <b>heating</b> of that kind <b>at the time</b> when the semen has been uprooted, is <b>uncommon.</b> Consequently, in this case the priest may hold his penis even with a soft cloth.",
            "<b>Shmuel says: Any</b> emission of <b>semen that is not felt by one’s entire body does not render</b> him <b>impure. What is the reason? The Merciful One states: “The flow of seed”</b> (Leviticus 15:16), which indicates that it is referring to an emission <b>that is fit to fertilize,</b> i.e., it is referring only to the kind of emission which is felt as it exits the body.",
            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 8:3): If one <b>was having</b> sexual <b>thoughts at night and he arose and found</b> that <b>his flesh</b> was <b>warm, he is ritually impure,</b> despite the fact that he did not sense the emission of semen. This shows that the impurity of a seminal emission applies even if one did not feel it in his entire body. The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Huna interpreted</b> this mishna as referring <b>to</b> one who <b>engaged in intercourse in his dream. Since it is impossible to engage in intercourse without</b> the accompanying <b>sensation,</b> he certainly must have felt it, despite the fact that he was unaware of this when he awoke.",
            "The Gemara cites <b>another version</b> of the above statement. <b>Shmuel says: Any semen that is not shot like an arrow does not render</b> one <b>impure.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> practical difference <b>is there between this version</b> of Shmuel’s ruling <b>and that version</b> of Shmuel’s ruling? The Gemara answers that the difference <b>between them</b> is a case where the semen <b>was uprooted</b> accompanied <b>by a sensation, but it emerged without a sensation.</b> According to the first version the man is rendered impure, as he sensed the uprooting of the semen, whereas according to the second version he is not impure, as this is not considered semen shot like an arrow.",
            "The Gemara notes that this <b>matter, which</b> is <b>obvious to Shmuel, is raised as a dilemma by Rava. As Rava raises a dilemma:</b> If semen <b>was uprooted</b> accompanied <b>by a sensation but it emerged without a sensation, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is the man ritually impure or not?",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 8:3): With regard to <b>one who experienced a seminal emission,</b> and <b>who</b> subsequently <b>immersed but did not urinate</b> before doing so, <b>when he</b> later <b>urinates</b> he is rendered <b>impure,</b> as some semen will also be emitted. The reason that he is rendered impure by this emission, which he does not sense, must be because the uprooting of the semen was accompanied by a sensation. The Gemara refutes this proof: <b>There it is different, as the majority</b> of the semen <b>emerged</b> accompanied <b>by a sensation,</b> and therefore he is rendered impure by this small amount even without a sensation.",
            "<b>Some say another version</b> of the previous discussion. <b>Shmuel says: Any semen that is not shot like an arrow cannot fertilize,</b> i.e., impregnate a woman. The Gemara infers: <b>It cannot fertilize, but it does render</b> the man who emits it <b>ritually impure, as it is stated: “If there be among you any man who is not ritually pure by reason of that which happened to him</b> by night” (Deuteronomy 23:11). This teaches that <b>even mere semen</b> which cannot fertilize renders one impure.",
            "<b>Rava raises</b> a similar <b>dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>a gentile who had</b> sexual <b>thoughts,</b> on account of which semen was uprooted but not emitted from his body, <b>and he</b> subsequently <b>descended and immersed</b> for the purpose of conversion, which means that he is now Jewish, and he then emitted semen, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to his status of ritual purity?",
            "The Gemara explains the dilemma: Even <b>if you say</b> that <b>we follow</b> the moment of <b>uprooting,</b> at which point he was still a gentile, one can maintain that <b>this statement</b> applies only when it entails <b>a stringency,</b> as is the case with regard to a born Jew. <b>But here, where</b> this would lead <b>to a leniency,</b> as the gentile would be ritually pure, perhaps <b>we do not say</b> that one follows the moment of uprooting. <b>Or perhaps</b> there <b>is no difference</b> in the application of this principle between a born Jew and a convert, but rather, one always follows the moment of uprooting. The Gemara concludes that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.",
            "<b>Rava raises</b> a further <b>dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>a woman who experienced a discharge of uterine blood after her menstrual period [<i>zava</i>], whose urine,</b> which imparts impurity like all liquids that she discharges vaginally, <b>was uprooted</b> but not emitted from her body, <b>and she descended</b> to the ritual bath <b>and immersed</b> to purify herself from her <i>ziva</i>, and urinated afterward, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?",
            "The Gemara explains the sides of the dilemma: Even <b>if you say</b> that generally <b>we follow</b> the moment of <b>uprooting,</b> and therefore she should be impure, since the urine was uprooted when she was a <i>zava</i>, nevertheless one can claim that <b>this statement</b> applies only with regard to <b>semen, as</b> the man <b>cannot hold it</b> back from emission. <b>But</b> with regard to the <b>urine of</b> a <i>zava</i>, <b>which she can hold in,</b> one does <b>not</b> follow the moment of uprooting. <b>Or perhaps</b> there <b>is no difference</b> in the application of this principle between urine and semen, but rather, in both cases one follows the moment of uprooting.

            "<b>Rava raises</b> yet another <b>dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>a gentile <i>zava</i>,</b> who is not impure by Torah law, although by rabbinic law she is considered a <i>zava</i> in all regards, <b>whose urine was uprooted</b> when she was a gentile,"

            "§ The mishna teaches that the emission of a <i>zav</i> and a seminal emission <b>impart impurity in any amount.

This verse indicates that the emission must be enough to cause a blockage of his penis.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Yishmael, what do they derive from this verse? The Gemara explains that according to the Rabbis, <b>that</b> verse <b>is necessary</b> to teach a different <i>halakha</i> with regard to a <i>zav</i>, that it is only a discharge which is <b>moist,</b> and which therefore could cause a blockage of the organ, that <b>imparts impurity, but a dry</b> discharge does <b>not impart impurity.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> from where does <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> derive that only a moist discharge imparts impurity? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is derived from</b> the word <b>“run”</b> in the verse “And this shall be his impurity in his issue: Whether his flesh run with his issue.”",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what do <b>the Rabbis</b> derive from this word? The Gemara explains that according to the Rabbis, <b>that</b> verse <b>comes to</b> teach the <b>number</b> of emissions by which a <i>zav</i> is rendered impure, as follows: The term <b>“his issue”</b> is <b>one</b> emission, the term <b>“his flesh run”</b> is another emission so that there are <b>two</b> emissions, and the term <b>“with his issue”</b> makes a total of <b>three</b> emissions.

            "The Gemara continues: From the last section of the verse: <b>“Or his flesh be stopped from his issue,</b> it is his <b>impurity,”</b> it is derived that one is <b>impure</b> even by means of <b>part of his issue,</b> i.e., even if he did not experience three emissions. Here the verse <b>teaches with regard to a <i>zav</i> who experienced two emissions that</b> although he is not obligated to bring an offering, he <b>renders</b> a surface designated for <b>lying and</b> a surface designated for <b>sitting ritually impure</b> by lying or sitting on them, even without touching them directly. The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Yishmael, from where does he</b> derive this <i>halakha</i> of the requisite <b>number</b> of emissions?

            "<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Simai says: The verse enumerated two</b> emissions <b>and called</b> the <i>zav</i> <b>impure:</b> “When any man has an emission out of his flesh, due to his issue he is impure” (Leviticus 15:2).

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who derives both</b> the <i>halakha</i> of impurity and the obligation to bring an offering <b>from</b> the single verse: “And <b>this shall be his impurity in his issue,” what do they,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>do with</b> the other verse: <b>“When any man has an emission out of his flesh”?</b> The Gemara answers that this verse is <b>necessary</b> to teach the <i>halakha</i> that a <i>zav</i> is not impure <b>unless</b> the discharge <b>emerges from his flesh.</b>",
            "The Gemara further asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the last part of the previous verse, which can be read as: <b>His issue is impure</b> (Leviticus 15:2)? The Gemara explains that this <b>teaches with regard to the issue</b> itself <b>that it is impure,</b> i.e., not only does it render the man who emitted it impure, but the substance itself is impure and imparts impurity to others by contact.",

            "The Gemara analyzes this <i>baraita</i>: <b>What, is it not</b> referring <b>to one who touches</b> semen, and the <i>baraita</i> rules that he is rendered impure by any amount?

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And does</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal not impart impurity in any amount?

            "The Gemara answers that the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a limb is different, as</b> when <b>all of it</b> is intact <b>it stands in place of a lentil</b>-bulk, i.e., a whole limb is considered like a lentil-bulk of the carcass of a creeping animal, regardless of its actual size. The proof is <b>that if</b> it were <b>lacking</b> any slight <b>bit,</b> thereby causing this <b>limb</b> of a creeping animal to be less than a lentil-bulk, <b>would it impart impurity?</b> Certainly not. Clearly, then, the impurity of a limb is due to its wholeness, not its size.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> teaches: The stringency that applies to the carcass of a creeping animal but not to semen is that with regard to a creeping animal there is no differentiation concerning its impurity, which is not the case with regard to semen. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the differentiation</b> with regard to <b>the impurity of semen? If we say</b> that this is referring to the difference <b>between</b> the semen of <b>Jews,</b> to which this impurity applies, <b>and</b> the semen <b>of gentiles,</b> to which it does not apply, <b>there is also</b> a differentiation with regard to the impurity of the carcass of a creeping animal between <b>a sea mouse,</b> which is not impure, and <b>a land mouse,</b> which is impure.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to the differentiation <b>between</b> the emission of <b>a minor,</b> which is not classified as semen and which does not render him impure, <b>and</b> that of <b>an adult,</b> which does render him impure.

In light of the statement of Rabbi Meir, how could Yusteni have become pregnant at age seven?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that Yusteni was able to become pregnant at such a young age because she was a gentile, and the verse states with regard to gentiles: <b>“Their flesh is the flesh of donkeys”</b> (Ezekiel 23:20). <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that Yusteni was lying when she said she became pregnant at age seven, as it is stated with regard to gentiles: <b>“Whose mouth speaks falsehood, and their right hand is a right hand of lying”</b> (Psalms 144:8).",
            "<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident involving a certain woman who came before Rabbi Akiva</b> and <b>said to him: My teacher, I engaged in intercourse within three years</b> of my birth; <b>what</b> is <b>my</b> status with regard to marrying <b>into the priesthood?</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>said to her: You are fit</b> to marry <b>into the priesthood.</b>",

The Gemara answers that <b>this statement</b> of Rav Pappa, that there is no concern that perhaps the pubic hairs fell out, applies only <b>with regard to <i>ḥalitza</i>, but with regard to refusal</b> everyone agrees that <b>we are concerned</b> that they might have fallen out.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>By inference, does the one who says</b> that <b>we are concerned</b> that perhaps the hairs fell out maintain that this twelve-year-old <b>performs <i>ḥalitza</i>? But</b> this cannot be correct, as <b>he says</b> that <b>we are merely concerned</b> that the hairs might have fallen out, not that this is certainly the case. How, then, can she perform <i>ḥalitza</i> like an adult?",
            "<b>Rather,</b> Rava is <b>actually</b> referring to a case <b>where one did not examine</b> the girl, <b>and with regard to <i>ḥalitza</i> we are concerned</b> that she might not have developed hairs and is still a minor. <b>And when Rava said</b> that there is <b>a presumption</b> that a twelve-year-old has developed signs indicating puberty, he was referring <b>to refusal, but with regard to <i>ḥalitza</i> she requires examination.</b>",
            "With regard to the issue of whether there is concern that hairs might have fallen out, <b>Rav Dimi of Neharde’a said: The <i>halakha</i></b> is that if a girl reached the age of twelve and she was examined and the signs of puberty were not found, <b>we are concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the pubic hairs <b>fell out.</b> Consequently, if her mother or brothers had accepted betrothal for her when she was a minor, she cannot perform refusal at that stage.",
            "The Gemara adds: <b>And this statement</b> applies only in a case <b>where</b> her husband <b>betrothed her during</b> the <b>time,</b> before she reached the age of twelve years and one day, <b>and engaged in intercourse</b> with her <b>after</b> the <b>time,</b> when she was already twelve years and one day old. This is a situation <b>where there is an uncertainty</b> with regard to <b>Torah law,</b> since if she had developed two hairs and is an adult, the marriage applies by Torah law, due to the intercourse. <b>But</b> if he engaged in intercourse with her only <b>at the outset,</b> before she turned twelve, there is <b>no</b> concern that perhaps she developed pubic hairs and they fell out, as this marriage applies by rabbinic law.",

            "Rav Huna explains: <b>As it is stated: “When</b> either <b>a man</b> or a woman <b>shall clearly utter a vow”</b> (Numbers 6:2), from which it is derived that if one on the brink of adulthood is able to articulate that his vow is in the name of God, his vows are valid. <b>And</b> another verse states: <b>“He shall not profane his word”</b> (Numbers 30:3).

            "Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> with regard to vows: <b>“This is the matter</b> which the Lord has commanded. When a man vows a vow to the Lord, or takes an oath” (Numbers 30:2–3). The emphasis of “this” indicates that it is only with regard to this matter, i.e., prohibitions resulting from vows, that a discriminating minor on the brink of adulthood is considered an adult, but he is not rendered liable to bring an offering for his misuse.",
            "The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>. <b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that a discriminating minor on the brink of adulthood is considered an adult <b>with regard to</b> a vow of <b>prohibition and with regard to</b> the prohibition of <b>he shall not profane</b> his word, which indicates that he is <b>liable</b> for violating this prohibition. This supports the opinion of Rav Huna that a minor is flogged for eating food he consecrated. The Gemara refutes this proof: There is room to <b>say</b> that the word: And, in the phrase: With regard to a vow of prohibition and with regard to the prohibition of he shall not profane his word, should be omitted, and the <i>baraita</i> is comparing a minor to an adult <b>with regard to the prohibition</b> of <b>he shall not profane</b> his word, but it does not indicate that he is liable to receive lashes for violating this prohibition.",
            "The Gemara asks: Can the <i>baraita</i> actually mean that a minor is compared to an adult with regard to <b>the prohibition</b> of <b>he shall not profane</b> his word, but he is not flogged? <b>Whichever way you</b> look at it, this is problematic: <b>If a discriminating</b> minor <b>on the brink of adulthood</b> is considered an adult <b>by Torah law, he should be flogged too,</b> for his violation. <b>And if a discriminating</b> minor <b>on the brink of adulthood</b> is <b>not</b> considered an adult <b>by Torah law, there is no prohibition</b> violated here <b>either.</b> The Gemara answers that according to the <i>baraita</i> the prohibition does not apply to the minor himself, but <b>to those who are warned to</b> keep <b>him</b> away from the prohibited item.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: If so, one can <b>conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that if <b>a minor eats</b> meat from unslaughtered <b>animal carcasses</b> or violates other prohibitions, <b>the court is commanded to prevent him</b> from doing so. This is problematic, as elsewhere it is stated that this matter is subject to dispute (see <i>Yevamot</i> 114a). The Gemara explains: <b>Here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the minor <b>consecrated</b> the food item <b>and others ate</b> it. They are liable to receive lashes for their consumption, but if he ate it he is not liable.",
            "The Gemara raises another difficulty: <b>This works out well according to the one who said</b> that if a minor <b>consecrated</b> a food item <b>and others ate</b> it, <b>they are flogged.

            "The Gemara therefore reverts to the interpretation that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to the prohibition of he shall not profane his word, not the punishment for violation of the vow.

            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> there is still concern for a violation, as <b>when she grows</b> and becomes an adult <b>she will eat</b> the food that she rendered forbidden to herself, relying <b>on the initial nullification</b> of her vow by her husband, which was not valid. At that stage she is an adult, whom the court is certainly commanded to prevent from violating prohibitions.",
            "<b>Rabba bar Livai said</b> that this is not a concern, as <b>her husband nullifies her</b> vows <b>each and every moment,</b> and therefore when she reaches majority he will nullify her vow in a manner that is valid by Torah law. <b>And</b> this <b>is</b> the <i>halakha</i>, that the nullification takes effect by Torah law, only in a case <b>where</b> her husband <b>engaged in intercourse</b> with her after she became an adult, thereby rendering their marriage valid by Torah law.",
            "The Gemara raises another difficulty: <b>But</b> there is a principle that <b>a husband cannot nullify</b> vows of his wife that <b>preceded</b> their marriage; and as she is considered his wife by Torah law only when she becomes an adult, her vow when she was a minor preceded their marriage. The Gemara answers that he can still nullify her vow, <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rav Pineḥas in the name of Rava, as Rav Pineḥas said in the name of Rava: Any</b> woman <b>who takes a vow,</b> it is from the outset contingent <b>on her husband’s consent</b> that <b>she takes the vow.</b> Since the minor was married by rabbinic law, she vowed on the condition that her husband should agree to her vow, and therefore the nullification is valid by Torah law.",
            "§ The Gemara continues to discuss the validity of the vows of a discriminating minor on the brink of adulthood. <b>Abaye said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 1:3): With regard to <b>a minor who has not grown two hairs, Rabbi Yehuda says: His <i>teruma</i> is not</b> valid <b><i>teruma</i>.

            "The Sages <b>assumed</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei holds</b> that <b><i>teruma</i> in the present</b> applies <b>by Torah law.</b> They therefore objected: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that <b>a discriminating</b> minor <b>on the brink of adulthood</b> is an adult <b>by Torah law,</b> one can understand that one who is <b>a man by Torah law</b> with regard to vows <b>can come and prepare untithed produce [<i>tivla</i>]</b> for consumption by tithing it, which also applies <b>by Torah law.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Yosei hold</b> that <b><i>teruma</i> in the present</b> applies <b>by rabbinic law?

            "These two expressions of possession indicate that the Jewish people had <b>a first possession</b> of Eretz Yisrael in the days of Joshua, when Eretz Yisrael was first sanctified with regard to the obligation of its mitzvot, <b>and they had a second</b> possession at the time of Ezra and the return of the Babylonian exile. In other words, the sanctity of the land lapsed when the First Temple was destroyed and the Jews were exiled to Babylonia, and therefore a second sanctification was necessary when they returned to their land.

            "The Gemara answers that <b>Rabbi Yosei taught</b> <i>Seder Olam</i> <b>but he does not maintain</b> in accordance with <b>its</b> ruling here. The Gemara adds: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> that this is so, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to non-sacred <b>dough that became mixed</b> with <i>teruma</i> dough, <b>or which was leavened with leaven of <i>teruma</i>,</b>"

Consequently, <b>it is not rendered unfit</b> for consumption, i.e., rendered ritually impure, <b>by one</b> who was ritually impure <b>who immersed that day</b> and is waiting for nightfall for his purification process to be completed. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda.

            "Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, continued: <b>And I said to them:</b> On the contrary, <b>even according to the one who said</b> that <b><i>teruma</i> in the present</b> applies <b>by Torah law,</b> the obligation to separate <b><i>ḥalla</i></b> applies <b>by rabbinic law, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to <i>ḥalla</i>: “When you come into the land where I bring you…from the first of your dough you shall set apart a cake for a gift” (Numbers 15:18–20). <b>If</b> the obligation applies <b>“when you come”</b> into the land, one <b>might</b> have thought that it took effect <b>from</b> the moment <b>that two or three spies entered</b> the land. Therefore <b>the verse states: “When you come,”</b> from which it is derived that the Torah is saying: <b>I said</b> that the obligation applies <b>when all of you come, and not when some of you come.</b>",
            "According to this <i>baraita</i>, the separation of <i>ḥalla</i> is an obligation by Torah law only when the entire Jewish people come to Eretz Yisrael. <b>And when Ezra brought</b> the Jewish people to Eretz Yisrael at the beginning of the Second Temple period, <b>not all of them ascended.</b> Since the majority of the Jewish people stayed behind, separating <i>ḥalla</i> was not restored to the status of an obligation by Torah law.",

            "The Gemara answers that this matter <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> and Rav maintains in accordance with the opinion that full years are required. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Full years are required with regard to the period of one <b>year stated with regard to sacrificial</b> animals, e.g., “a lamb in its first year” (Leviticus 12:6); the one <b>year stated with regard to houses of walled cities,</b> during which one can redeem a house he has sold in a walled city (see Leviticus 25:29); and the <b>two years</b> stated <b>with regard to an ancestral field,</b> during which one cannot yet redeem an ancestral field he has sold (see Leviticus 25:15).",

This supports the opinion of Rav that the years mentioned with regard to a sexually underdeveloped man or woman are full years.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that the one <b>year stated with regard to sacrificial</b> animals is calculated by whole years and not by calendar years? <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said</b> that <b>the verse states: “A lamb in its first year”</b> (Leviticus 12:6). Since the verse does not state: A one-year-old lamb, it means <b>a year</b> based on calculation of <b>its</b> life, <b>and not a year of the universal count,</b> i.e., the calendar year.",
            "The Gemara further asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> that the one <b>year stated with regard to houses of walled cities</b> is calculated by a whole year and not by calendar year? <b>The verse states:</b> “Then he may redeem it <b>within a whole year after it is sold,</b> for a full year he shall have the right of redemption” (Leviticus 25:29).

            "<b>of years of the crops he shall sell to you”</b> (Leviticus 25:15). The plural form of both “years” and “crops” indicates that the number of years does not necessarily correspond to the quantity of crops. Consequently, <b>sometimes you</b> might <b>sell three</b> yields of <b>crops in two years.</b> If one purchases a field in the summer, when the produce has not yet been harvested, and he harvests that yield and subsequently grows and harvests two more crops before the completion of the whole two years, he will have gained three yields in less than two years.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> that the <b>six years</b> stated <b>with regard to a Hebrew slave</b> is calculated by whole years? The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states: “Six years he shall work, and in the seventh</b> he shall go out free for nothing” (Exodus 21:2). The word “and” in the phrase <b>“and in the seventh”</b> indicates that <b>he shall also work</b> in the seventh calendar year, if six full years have not passed since he was sold. For example, if he was sold in the month of Nisan, it means that five years and six months have passed when Tishrei, the first month of the seventh year, arrives; he has not yet completed six years of service, and he must work in this seventh calendar year as well, until the date on which he was sold.",

            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who holds that it is possible for the upper sign to precede the lower, <b>that</b> accounts for that verse <b>which is written</b> with regard to a maturing young woman: “And you increased and grew up, and you came to excellent beauty; <b>your breasts were fashioned, and your hair was grown”</b> (Ezekiel 16:7).

According to Rabbi Yehuda, placing the vessel directly into a tub of water constitutes the use of force to a certain degree, and he maintains that if water enters the vessel in such a case, this does not count as liquid entering the vessel. Therefore, he rejects the testing method of the first <i>tanna</i>.",

If so, the sixth set of eight days consists of three menstrual days followed by five days of <i>ziva</i>. Although she is not a menstruating woman in those three days, as she did not previously count seven clean days, they still do not count for her seven clean days of <i>ziva</i>, since they are fit to be menstrual days.

            "The <i>baraita</i> asks: Why is this derivation necessary? <b>Could this not</b> be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference?</b> Since <i>ziva</i> <b>causes impurity to others,</b> i.e., to the one who emitted the discharge, is it <b>not all the more so</b> that <i>ziva</i> <b>itself</b> is impure? The <i>baraita</i> replies that the case of the <b>scapegoat</b> brought on Yom Kippur <b>may prove</b> that this inference is not valid, <b>as it causes impurity to others,</b> i.e., the dispatcher of the scapegoat is rendered impure, <b>and</b> yet the goat <b>itself is pure.

            "The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> one <b>may say</b> that <b>this statement,</b> that the discharge of <i>ziva</i> transmits impurity, applies only to transmitting impurity <b>by contact.

            "Rav Yehuda of Diskarta clarifies this interpretation of the verse. The term: <b>An issue [<i>zov</i>],</b> would indicate <b>one</b> emission of <i>ziva</i>.

            "<b>Reish Lakish said:</b> Rabbi Meir would rule in <b>this</b> case of a compound uncertainty exactly as he rules in <b>that</b> case of a single uncertainty, i.e., there is no difference between the two cases.

This indicates that Rabbi Meir deems her impure even if a man and a woman both urinated into the same basin where the blood was found.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to Reish Lakish’s opinion: <b>If so,</b> i.e., if according to Rabbi Meir a woman is impure even when a man also urinates into the same basin, <b>now</b> that <b>Rabbi Meir deems her impure in</b> a case of <b>compound uncertainty, is it necessary</b> for the mishna to teach his opinion <b>in</b> a case of <b>one uncertainty?</b> The Gemara answers: The mishna formulated the <i>halakha</i> in that manner <b>to convey the far-reaching</b> nature of the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei,</b> i.e., <b>that he deems her pure even in</b> a case of <b>one uncertainty.</b>",

The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion: <b>If so,</b> i.e., if Rabbi Meir deems her pure when both a man and a woman urinate into the same basin, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>teach: Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yosei deem her pure.</b> Why does the <i>tanna</i> mention only Rabbi Yosei? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, it is indeed so,</b> that Rabbi Meir agrees with this ruling, <b>but since</b> the mishna <b>left off</b> with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei</b> at the end of the first clause of the mishna, the <i>tanna</i> <b>opened</b> the latter clause <b>with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei</b> as well.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> as <b>Rabbi Yosei deems</b> her <b>pure</b> in a case <b>of one uncertainty, is it necessary</b> for the mishna to teach his opinion a case <b>of a compound uncertainty?</b> The Gemara answers: It is necessary for the <i>tanna</i> to state that Rabbi Yosei deems her pure in a case of compound uncertainty, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>this statement,</b> that Rabbi Yosei deems her pure, applies only <b>after the fact,</b> if the woman has already touched pure items, <b>but</b> he does <b>not</b> deem her pure <b><i>ab initio</i>.</b> Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that Rabbi Yosei deems her pure even <i>ab initio</i>.",

            "The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the mishna: <b>Since Rabbi Shimon said</b> that <b>the presumptive status of</b> the <b>blood</b> is that it was discharged <b>from the woman,</b> evidently there <b>is no difference</b> in his opinion whether she was <b>standing or</b> whether she was <b>sitting.</b>",

            "<b>who is</b> of age and already <b>seeing</b> a flow of menstrual blood, i.e., she has had a flow of menstrual blood.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>From where</b> does Rav know that this is referring to a gentile woman who once experienced a flow of blood? He infers from the mishna that the gentile woman it mentions is <b>similar to a menstruating woman: Just as a menstruating woman</b> is one <b>who sees,</b> i.e., who has already experienced bleeding, <b>so too,</b> the mishna is referring to an adult <b>gentile woman who</b> already <b>sees</b> menstrual blood.",
            "<b>Rav Sheshet says: I say</b> that <b>when Rav was dozing or sleeping he said that <i>halakha</i>,</b> i.e., it is an error. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a woman loaned her garment to a gentile and subsequently found a blood stain on it, <b>she attributes</b> the stain <b>to the gentile woman.</b> This <i>tanna</i> deems it permitted for her to attribute the blood to any gentile woman, regardless of her age or her likelihood of bleeding. <b>Rabbi Meir</b> disagrees and <b>says:</b> This applies specifically <b>to a gentile woman who is fit to see</b> menstrual blood. <b>And</b> the Gemara adds that <b>even Rabbi Meir says only that</b> the gentile woman must be <b>fit to see</b> menstrual blood, <b>but</b> he too agrees that <b>it is not necessary</b> for her to be <b>seeing</b> blood at that time.

            "<b>Rava said</b> in response to Rav Sheshet’s challenge: <b>And</b> how can <b>you understand</b> that <b>Rabbi Meir</b> is coming <b>to be stringent?</b> Rav Sheshet maintains that according to the first <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> she can attribute the blood stain to any gentile, whereas Rabbi Meir rules stringently that she may attribute it only to a gentile who is fit to experience bleeding. This is incorrect, as <b>Rabbi Meir</b> is actually coming <b>to be lenient.</b> In other words, the first <i>tanna</i> is more stringent, as he deems it permitted for her to attribute the blood stain only to a gentile woman who had experienced a menstrual flow at least once. By contrast, Rabbi Meir rules that she may attribute the stain to a gentile woman who is old enough to experience bleeding, even if she has never experienced a menstrual flow.",
            "The Gemara provides the reason for Rava’s opinion. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A woman who loaned her garment to a gentile woman and subsequently finds a blood stain on it <b>may not attribute</b> the stain <b>to</b> the <b>gentile woman. Rabbi Meir says</b> that <b>she may attribute</b> the blood stain to the gentile woman. <b>But if so,</b> the first <i>baraita</i>, which states that according to the first <i>tanna</i> she may attribute the blood stain to any gentile woman, is <b>difficult.</b> You must <b>answer like this:</b> According to the first <i>tanna</i> she may attribute the blood to any gentile woman provided that <b>she sees,</b> i.e., that she once experienced bleeding. By contrast, <b>Rabbi Meir says</b> a more lenient opinion, <b>that</b> she may attribute it to the gentile woman provided that <b>she is fit to see</b> menstrual blood, <b>and</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even though she has not</b> actually <b>seen</b> menstrual blood yet.",
            "§ <b>The Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> with regard to a woman who loaned her garment to another woman who was a lesser <i>zava</i>: The lender <b>may attribute</b> the blood stain on the loaned garment <b>to a woman who observes</b> a clean <b>day for</b> each <b>day</b> she experiences a discharge, if the blood is found <b>on her second</b> day, i.e., the day after she had a discharge, despite the fact that she does not have a presumptive status of seeing blood. It is nevertheless considered that her uterus is open and the likelihood is that she will experience bleeding.",
            "<b>And</b> likewise, she may also attribute the blood stain if she loaned her garment <b>to a woman counting seven</b> clean days <b>who did not immerse</b> in a ritual bath, and who will now have to count another seven clean days. <b>Therefore,</b> the status of the one who loaned the garment <b>is fixed, and</b> the status of <b>the other</b> woman <b>is ruined</b> and she must begin her counting again; this is <b>the statement of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.

            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> both Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>agree that</b> a woman who lends her garment <b>may attribute</b> any blood stain found on it <b>to a woman</b> who <b>observes a day for a day</b> if it is <b>on her first</b> day of the discharge.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the clause starting with: <b>Therefore,</b> mentioned <b>by Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel?</b> It is obvious that the status of only one woman is ruined, so what information does this observation add? The Gemara answers that this clause does not add any new information; rather, the <i>baraita</i> taught it <b>because</b> of the use of the similar clause beginning with: Therefore, stated <b>by Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi in the latter part of the <i>baraita</i>.",
            "The Gemara persists: But <b>why do I</b> need the clause starting with: <b>Therefore,</b> in the statement <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? That too is apparently superfluous.

            "§ With regard to the dispute between Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>Rav Ḥisda says:</b> In a case of two individuals, one of whom was <b>ritually impure and</b> the other of whom was <b>pure, who walked on two paths, one</b> of which was <b>pure and</b> the other <b>one impure</b> due to a corpse buried there, and neither remembers which path he took, and afterward they handled items of ritual purity, e.g., the portion of produce designated for the priest [<i>teruma</i>] or consecrated items, <b>we have arrived at the dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.</b> According to Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, if one of the two individuals was already impure it can be assumed that he was the one who walked along the ritually impure path, and the other individual remains pure. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi claims that there is no assumption that the one who was pure retains that state, as it is equally possible that he walked along the ritually impure path.",
            "<b>Rav Adda objects to this</b> suggestion of Rav Ḥisda, claiming that one cannot compare the two cases. It is possible that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>states</b> his <i>halakha</i> <b>only there,</b> with regard to a woman who observes a day for a day, as she can immerse in a ritual bath at any time, and <b>therefore both</b> women <b>are like each other,</b> i.e., both have a presumption of ritual purity. But <b>here,</b> in the case of the two individuals walking on two paths, <b>what</b> practical <b>difference</b> does it make to the one who was previously impure if he remains ritually impure? Since there is no change of status, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi would agree in that case that it can be assumed that the individual who was previously impure was the one who walked on the impure path.",
            "<b>And</b> the Gemara asks: How would <b>Rav Ḥisda</b> respond to this claim? Rav Ḥisda would answer that a woman who observes a day for a day is also not fully pure, as <b>ultimately she requires immersion</b> in a ritual bath to complete her purification, and yet Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi still rejects the attribution of the blood flow to her. Accordingly, the two cases are comparable and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi would not assume that the individual who was already impure was the one who walked along the path that was impure.",

            "Before explaining the objection, the Gemara first analyzes the <i>baraita</i>. <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>itself</b> is <b>difficult.</b> In <b>the first clause you said</b> that a woman who loans her garment to another and subsequently finds a blood stain on it <b>may not attribute</b> the blood stain to a woman who was impure due to having previously seen a blood stain, whereas in <b>the latter clause you said</b> that she <b>may attribute</b> the blood stain to such a woman.

            "<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> an alternative resolution of the contradiction: Both <b>this</b> clause <b>and that</b> clause are in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.

Since she is in any case impure for that day, she is not adversely affected by having the new stain attributed to her. The case where the blood stain may not be attributed to the other woman is a case where the blood stain in question was found <b>on her second</b> day, i.e., the day after she found the blood stain, when she is not impure but merely requires immersion.

This attribution of the blood stain to the woman who was already impure due to seeing a blood stain does not harm her impure status in any way, as items she had previously touched were already considered impure. <b>There,</b> in the beginning of the <i>baraita</i>, where the ruling is that the lender may not attribute the blood stain to a woman who was already impure, it is referring to her own status <b>with regard to the future.</b> With regard to the future, one may not attribute the stain to woman who had already seen a blood stain, as this attribution would ruin that woman’s counting of pure days.",

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that if one of the women examined herself when the blood was discovered and found that she was impure due to menstruation, she is impure and the other two are pure. In this regard, <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The other two women may attribute the blood to the one who examined herself only <b>when she examined herself within</b> the brief <b>period of time</b> needed for the onset of <b>menstruation.</b> But if she checked herself after this time, although she is impure, the other women are also impure, due to uncertainty.",
            "The Gemara explains: Rav <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>bar Padda, who said:</b> There are three time periods with regard to defining a woman’s ritual-purity status if she sees blood after engaging in intercourse. The shortest is the period of time required for the onset of menstruation, i.e., for menstrual bleeding to begin. The next shortest is the time it would take the woman to get out of bed after intercourse and wash her private parts. The longest period is any time longer than that. If a woman finds blood after intercourse within the period of time needed for the onset of menstruation, she must have been impure during intercourse. With regard to <b>any</b> woman <b>whose husband</b> would be liable <b>to</b> bring <b>a sin offering</b> if he had engaged in intercourse with her, because she found the blood within that short period, if she had not been engaging in intercourse, but rather had been preparing food in a state of ritual purity, and then she found blood within that short period, all the <b>pure items</b> that she touched <b>are ritually impure.</b>",
            "By contrast, with regard to any woman <b>whose husband</b> would be liable <b>to</b> bring <b>a provisional guilt offering</b> if he had engaged in intercourse with her, as it is uncertain whether he violated a transgression for which he would be liable to bring a sin offering, if she had not been engaging in intercourse, but rather had been preparing food in a state of ritual purity and then found blood within that same time period, the status of all the <b>pure items</b> she touched is <b>suspended,</b> as their status is uncertain. They are not burned but they may not be eaten either. Finally, with regard to any woman <b>whose husband</b> would be <b>exempt</b> from bringing any offering, i.e., where she finds blood after a longer time period, if she had not been engaging in intercourse, but rather had been preparing food in a state of ritual purity, and then found the blood after a longer time period, all the <b>pure items</b> she touched remain <b>pure.</b>",
            "<b>And Rabbi Oshaya says:</b> There is no connection between her husband’s obligation to bring an offering and the ritual-purity status of the items she handled. <b>Even</b> if <b>her husband</b> is liable <b>to</b> bring <b>a sin offering,</b> i.e., when she discovered the blood within the period of time needed for the onset of menstruation, the status of all the <b>pure items</b> she touched before she discovered the blood is <b>suspended,</b> as their status is uncertain.",
            "Rabbi Oshaya explains his reasoning. <b>Granted, there,</b> in the case of intercourse, where the husband must bring an offering, one can <b>say</b> that the male <b>organ prevented the blood</b> from emerging from her body, and therefore it is clear that she was impure beforehand. <b>But here,</b> in the case of preparing food in a state of ritual purity, <b>if it is so that there was blood</b> coming out of her while she was preparing the food, <b>what prevented</b> the blood from emerging from her body?",

If all three of them examined themselves and found that they were ritually pure, all of them are ritually impure.

            "The Gemara discusses other cases involving possible mistakes in examinations. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Meir said</b> that there was <b>an incident involving a sycamore</b> tree <b>in Kefar Sava, with regard to which they had a presumption of ritual impurity,</b> i.e., a presumption that there was a corpse buried beneath it. <b>And they examined</b> by digging in that place <b>and did not find</b> any corpse. <b>Some days</b> later, <b>the wind blew at it and uprooted</b> the sycamore tree, <b>and they found a skull from a corpse stuck in its roots.</b> This apparently indicates that in general one cannot rely upon an examination.

            "The Gemara cites another case. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei said</b> that there was <b>an incident involving a cave in Shiḥin with regard to which they had a presumption of ritual impurity</b> of a corpse. <b>And they examined</b> by digging inside the cave <b>until they reached ground that was as smooth as a fingernail, and they did not find</b> any corpse. <b>Some days</b> later <b>workers entered</b> the cave <b>because</b> they sought shelter from <b>the rain.

            "The Gemara cites yet another relevant case. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Abba Shaul says</b> that there was <b>an incident involving bedrock in Beit Ḥoron, with regard to which they had a presumption of ritual impurity</b> of a corpse. <b>And the Sages were unable to examine</b> it <b>because</b> the area of the bedrock <b>was too large.

            "It is <b>taught: That</b> pit that they found is <b>the pit that Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, filled with corpses, as it is written: “Now the pit where Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain by the side of Gedaliah</b> was that which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasa king of Israel; the same Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, filled with them that were slain” (Jeremiah 41:9).",
            "The Gemara analyzes that verse: <b>And did Gedaliah kill them? But didn’t Ishmael kill them?</b> Gedaliah was one of those killed by Ishmael and his men (see Jeremiah 41:2). The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, since</b> Gedaliah <b>should have been concerned</b> and cautious based <b>on the advice of Johanan, son of Kareah,</b> who warned him that Ishmael was conspiring to kill him and even offered to go and kill Ishmael in a preemptive strike (see Jeremiah 40:13–16), <b>but</b> Gedaliah <b>was not concerned</b> and he refused to listen to Johanan’s advice, saying that he did not want to listen to malicious speech, <b>the verse ascribes him</b> blame <b>as though he</b> himself <b>killed them.</b>",
            "§ In relation to the above comment that Gedaliah was killed after not heeding the warning of Johanan, the Gemara clarifies what is permitted when receiving such a warning. <b>Rava said:</b> With regard to <b>this</b> prohibition against listening to <b>malicious speech, even though one should not accept</b> the malicious speech as true, <b>one is</b> nevertheless <b>required to be concerned</b> about the harm that might result from ignoring it.",

The Gemara asks: <b>Now, Sihon and Og were brothers, as the Master said: Sihon and Og were sons of Ahijah, son of Shamhazai.</b> In <b>what</b> way is Sihon <b>different from Og, that</b> God found it necessary to warn Moses not to be <b>afraid</b> of Og, <b>and</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> Og <b>different from Sihon, that</b> there was <b>no</b> need for a warning not to be <b>afraid</b> of Sihon?",
            "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: From the answer</b> that God gave <b>to that righteous</b> one, Moses, <b>you know what was in his heart,</b> i.e., what gave Moses cause to fear. Moses <b>said</b> to himself: <b>Perhaps the merit of our forefather Abraham will stand for</b> Og and save him. Og was the one who told Abraham that Lot had been taken captive by the four kings, enabling Abraham to rescue Lot.",
            "The Gemara cites the source of this claim. <b>As it is stated: “And there came one that was saved, and told Abram the Hebrew,</b> now he dwelt by the terebinths of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshkol, and brother of Aner; and these were confederate with Abram. And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued as far as Dan” (Genesis 14:13–14). <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that the term “one that was saved” <b>is</b> referring to <b>Og, who was saved from</b> the punishment of <b>the generation of the flood.</b> For this reason, Moses was more afraid of Og.",
            "§ The Gemara cites another instance in which an impure item was lost, similar to the case discussed above involving the pile of stones. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Menstrual blood is itself a source of impurity.

In any event, this <i>baraita</i> teaches that there is an opinion that even if a woman examined herself only on the first day, she has a presumptive status of ritual purity.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a <i>zav</i> and a <i>zava</i>,</b> who are required to count and examine themselves on each of seven clean days before purification in a ritual bath, <b>who examined themselves on</b> the <b>first day and found</b> themselves <b>ritually pure,</b> i.e., with no blood, <b>and</b> they examined themselves <b>on the seventh day and found</b> themselves <b>ritually pure, and on the rest of the intervening days they did not examine</b> themselves, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: The presumptive status of</b> the <i>zav</i> and the <i>zava</i> is one of <b>ritual purity. Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> In that case, the <i>zav</i> and the <i>zava</i> <b>have</b> counted <b>only the first day and the seventh day,</b> two of the seven clean days, and they must count another five days to complete the tally. <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The <i>zav</i> and the <i>zava</i> <b>have</b> counted <b>only</b> the <b>seventh day,</b> and they must count another six days to complete the tally.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer said to Rabbi Yehoshua: According to your statement,</b> that the first day is included in her count of seven, <b>you are counting at intervals,</b> i.e., with days in-between that do not count, <b>and the Torah states:</b> “But if she be purified of her <i>ziva</i>, then she shall count to herself seven days, <b>and after that she shall be pure”</b> (Leviticus 15:28). This teaches that the purification of a <i>zava</i> must be <b>after</b> the seven days, i.e., <b>after all of the</b> days, which must be consecutive so <b>that there are no days of impurity separating between</b> the seven clean days.",

This indicates that even in cases where the Torah says that one must count consecutively, it is permitted to count with intervals in between countings.",
            "<b>And</b> how would <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> respond to Rabbi Yehoshua’s claim? He would say: <b>Granted, there</b> in the cases of the <i>zav</i> and the nazirite, <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “This is the law of him that has an issue, and of him from whom an emission of semen goes out, <b>so that he is thereby impure”</b> (Leviticus 15:32). This teaches <b>that</b> when a <i>zav</i> experiences a seminal emission it <b>overturns</b> the counting of <b>only that</b> one <b>day. And if</b> one would claim that the Sages should issue a decree <b>due to</b> the concern that one might <b>confuse</b> the <i>halakha</i> of one who had an emission of <i>ziva</i> during the seven clean days with a <i>zav</i> who had a seminal emission during the seven clean days, that is not a concern. The reason is that an emission of a <b><i>ziva</i></b> will <b>not be confused with</b> the case of <b>one who experienced a seminal emission.</b>",
            "Similarly, Rabbi Eliezer would say that in the case of <b>a nazirite who walked under overhanging boughs and protrusions</b> that have items whose status of impurity is uncertain beneath them, there is <b>also</b> no need to overturn all the previous days of counting, as <b>by Torah law we require a full-fledged tent</b> over a corpse, <b>and</b> it was <b>the Sages who decreed</b> that one who walks under overhanging boughs and protrusions is ritually impure. <b>And</b> a <i>halakha</i> that applies <b>by rabbinic law will not be confused</b> with a <i>halakha</i> that is mandated <b>by Torah law.</b>",
            "<b>But here,</b> in the case of a <i>zava</i> who counts only the first and seventh day, <b>if we are concerned</b> that as she did not count the five intermediate days <b>perhaps she saw</b> blood during those days, and since what occurred on those days is <b>uncertain,</b> only the first day counts for her, then one might <b>come to confuse</b> this situation <b>with</b> a case where she is <b>certain</b> that she saw blood during the intermediate days. One might mistakenly think that even if she definitely experiences bleeding during the intermediate days she can still count the first day as one of her seven clean days before immersing.",

            "§ The Gemara cites another discussion with regard to which days are included in the count of seven clean days. <b>Rav Sheshet says</b> that <b>Rav Yirmeya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rav says: A menstruating woman who</b> performed the examination marking the first step in her <b>transition</b> from ritual impurity <b>to ritual purity on her third</b> day <b>counts</b> that day as part <b>of the number of seven clean</b> days.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Why does a menstruating woman</b> require any kind of <b>counting?</b> If this is during her days when she is expected to menstruate she may immerse after the conclusion of seven days, whether or not those days were clean. <b>Rather, say</b> that Rav meant as follows: <b>A <i>zava</i> who</b> performed the examination marking the first step in her <b>transition</b> from ritual impurity to <b>ritual purity on her third</b> day <b>counts</b> that day as part <b>of the number of seven clean</b> days.",
            "<b>Rav Sheshet said to Rav Yirmeya bar Abba:</b> Did <b>Rav say his <i>halakha</i> in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Samaritans, who say</b> that <b>the day on which</b> a <i>zava</i> <b>ceases</b> to experience the emission of <i>ziva</i> <b>counts toward</b> the <b>number</b> of <b>seven</b> clean days, and she does not need to count seven complete days?",
            "Rav Yirmeya bar Abba replied: <b>When Rav says</b> his <i>halakha</i>, he meant <b>apart from</b> the <b>third</b> day. Rav Sheshet challenged: If Rav meant <b>apart from</b> the <b>third</b> day, that is <b>obvious;</b> there is no need for him to issue such a statement at all. Rav Yirmeya bar Abba replied: <b>No,</b> the statement that she begins counting immediately after the third day is <b>necessary</b> for a case <b>where</b> once she saw that she was clean after the third day of her <i>ziva</i> emissions <b>she did not examine</b> herself again <b>until</b> the <b>seventh</b> day.",
            "<b>And</b> Rav is <b>teaching us</b> two <i>halakhot</i>. <b>There,</b> in the previous discussion with regard to the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, Rav stated that an examination <b>at the beginning</b> is sufficient, <b>even though there is no</b> examination at the <b>end</b> of the seven days. <b>And here he teaches us</b> that an examination at the <b>end of</b> the seven days is sufficient, <b>even though there is no</b> examination at the <b>beginning of</b> the seven days, but only on the day when she ceased experiencing bleeding.",
            "Rav Yirmeya adds <b>that</b> it is necessary to teach both <i>halakhot</i>, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>we say</b> that an examination <b>at the beginning</b> is sufficient <b>even though there is no</b> examination at the <b>end of</b> the seven days, <b>as we establish</b> the clean days <b>in</b> accordance with <b>their presumptive status.

Therefore, this second statement of Rav <b>teaches us</b> that even if she only examined herself at the end of the seven clean days it is sufficient.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to Rav Yirmeya’s explanation. <b>Is that so? But when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael <b>he said: Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, raised an objection</b> to the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, that a woman who is uncertain whether or not she miscarried an actual fetus must bring an offering (see 29a). The reason is that the majority of pregnant women carry actual fetuses. Rabbi Yosef objected to this from the case of a woman who was <b>forgetful,</b> i.e., a woman who left town when she was pregnant, and later returned no longer pregnant. It is unknown whether she miscarried an actual fetus, and if it was a fetus, whether it was male or female. The conclusion there was that she does not have any days when blood she discharges is considered ritually pure, which is the <i>halakha</i> following a birth, as her miscarriage might not have been a fetus at all. Apparently, here one does not follow the principle that the majority of pregnant women carry actual fetuses.",
            "Ravin continues: <b>And I do not know what his objection is,</b> as the reason that she does not have any days when blood she discharges is considered ritually pure is not only due to the uncertainty as to whether or not she miscarried a fetus, but because it is also unknown when that miscarriage occurred, i.e., even if she miscarried a fetus, perhaps the days when blood she discharges is considered ritually pure had already been completed. <b>As we maintain</b> that the <b>first week that she comes before us,</b> when the court is uncertain with regard to her impurity, <b>we</b> tell <b>her</b> to <b>immerse</b> every <b>night</b> of that week, in the manner of a woman purifying herself after menstruation or childbirth, but <b>we do not</b> tell <b>her</b> to <b>immerse during the daytime,</b> as she has not counted seven clean days (see 29b).",
            "The Gemara explains how this discussion apparently contradicts Rav Yirmeya’s explanation. <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that <b>we do not require</b> all seven clean days to be <b>counted before us,</b> i.e., if an examination on the seventh day is sufficient, <b>let us</b> tell her to <b>immerse also</b> during <b>the daytime,</b> as <b>perhaps she gave birth to a male</b> baby <b>during</b> her days <b>of <i>ziva</i>, and</b> already <b>performed her</b> seven days of <b>counting</b> before she came before the court. The Gemara concludes: <b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> this statement of Ravin that <b>we require</b> that her seven clean days be <b>counted before us,</b> which is why the court does not instruct her to immerse during the daytime.",
            "The Gemara rejects this contention. <b>But didn’t we interpret</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who said</b> that <b>we require</b> her seven clean days to be <b>counted before us?</b> By contrast, Rav’s statement was in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, who holds that the days do not need to be counted before us.",
            "§ The Gemara stated earlier that according to the opinion of the Rabbis, the seven clean days do not need to be counted before us. The Gemara analyzes their opinion: <b>And from where do you say that according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis we do not require</b> that the seven days be <b>counted before us?</b> This is <b>as we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to a woman who was <b>forgetful</b> and does not know whether she is now in her days of menstruation or days of <i>ziva</i>, <b>who said: I saw</b> blood on <b>one day of impurity,</b> the court instructs <b>her to immerse nine immersions.</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> clarifies: Since there is no way of knowing whether she is a woman purifying herself after menstruation or after <i>ziva</i>, she must immerse <b>seven</b> immersions on the following seven nights, <b>for</b> purification from <b>menstruation,</b> as each of these days might be the last of the seven days of menstruation. <b>And</b> she must also immerse during <b>two</b> days as purification <b>from <i>ziva</i>,</b> i.e., on the day that she arrives, in case she experienced bleeding the day before, and on the following day, as perhaps she experienced bleeding on the day of her arrival. But if this woman says: <b>I saw</b> blood <b>at twilight</b> that renders me <b>impure,</b> the court instructs <b>her</b> to <b>immerse eleven immersions.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: These <b>eleven</b> days, <b>what is their purpose?</b> If she would normally require nine immersions, why does she require an extra two immersions if she experienced bleeding at twilight? <b>Rav Yirmeya of Difti said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring specifically to a case <b>where she came before us at twilight</b> and says that she also experienced bleeding at twilight, but it is not clear whether she experienced bleeding on a previous day at twilight, or today at twilight.",
            "Rav Yirmeya explains: Therefore, she requires <b>eight</b> immersions to purify herself <b>from menstruation,</b> seven in case each of the following nights is the night after the seventh day of menstruation, and the eighth in case she experienced bleeding during twilight of the day she arrived, and this occurred in a time which was actually part of the next day, such that she needs to immerse also on the eighth night from her arrival, <b>and three</b> additional immersions during the day to purify herself <b>from <i>ziva</i>.</b> She must immerse during the day three times: She must immerse immediately, because if she experienced bleeding on the previous day during twilight it may have still been day, and right now, at twilight, it might still be day; she must immerse on the next day, because if she experienced bleeding on the previous day during twilight it may have already been night; and she must immerse during the day following the next day, because perhaps she experienced bleeding this twilight after it was night.",
            "If this woman who is forgetful with regard to her cycle of menstruation and <i>ziva</i> says: <b>I have not seen any</b> blood <b>at all,</b> the court instructs <b>her to immerse fifteen immersions. Rava said,</b> in reference to this final <i>halakha</i> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>This <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not</b> a logical <b><i>halakha</i>.</b> Rather, it is like the <i>halakha</i> that <b>they judge in</b> a place named <b>Galaḥi.</b> In that place they follow the behavior of Sodom, and say that with regard to one <b>who has</b> one <b>ox, he must shepherd</b> the local flocks <b>one day,</b> and one <b>who does not have an ox must shepherd</b> the local flocks for <b>two days.</b> It is not logical that a woman who has not experienced a flow of blood must immerse more times than one who has experienced a flow of blood.",
            "Apropos the mention of Galaḥi, the Gemara relates an incident that occurred in that place. <b>There was an orphan</b> in that town, <b>the son of a widow [<i>armelata</i>],</b> who had no oxen of his own. The people of that town <b>gave him their oxen</b> to shepherd. This orphan <b>went and slaughtered</b> all of the oxen. <b>He said</b> to the townspeople: Whoever <b>has an ox should take one skin,</b> while one <b>who does not have an ox should take two skins.</b> The people of Galaḥi <b>said to</b> the orphan: <b>What is this that you are saying,</b> i.e., what is the reason? <b>He said to them: The end of the law is like the beginning of the law: Isn’t the beginning of the law</b> that one <b>who has no</b> ox <b>is preferred,</b> and must shepherd the oxen for two days? So too, with regard to <b>the end of the law,</b> one <b>who has no</b> ox <b>is preferred</b> and should receive two hides.",
            "The Gemara returns to discuss Rava’s comment with regard to the ruling of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Here too</b> one can claim: <b>And if</b> in a case <b>where she says: I saw</b> blood, <b>it is sufficient for her</b> to immerse <b>either nine immersions or eleven immersions,</b> so too, in a case <b>where she says: I did not see</b> any flow of blood at all, is it logical that <b>she requires fifteen immersions?</b>",
            "<b>Rather, say</b> that <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> means: If a woman says: <b>I saw</b> a flow of blood <b>but I do not know how many</b> days <b>I saw</b> blood, and likewise I do not know <b>whether I saw</b> the flow <b>during the days of menstruation or</b> if <b>I saw</b> the flow <b>during the days of <i>ziva</i>,</b> in such a case, the court instructs <b>her to immerse fifteen immersions.</b> The reason for these immersions is as follows: If <b>she comes before us during the daytime, we give her seven</b> immersions, beginning from that night, to remove the impurity <b>of menstruation.</b> Any of those seven nights might be the night after the last of her days of menstruation."
        ],
        [
            "<b>And</b> she requires <b>eight</b> immersions during the day to purify her <b>from</b> her <b><i>ziva</i>,</b> as it is possible that she experienced bleeding for three consecutive days, rendering her a greater <i>zava</i>, and one of those was on this day that she came before the court, and it is also possible that the day she arrived she did not experience bleeding, and she was a <i>zava</i> during her last clean day and had to immerse that day. If <b>she comes before us at night, we give her eight</b> immersions to purify herself <b>from her menstruation,</b> including one on the night that she comes before the court, <b>and seven</b> immersions during the day to purify herself <b>from</b> her <b><i>ziva</i>.</b>",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: With regard to her <b><i>ziva</i>,</b> she still <b>requires eight</b> immersions. Since it is possible that she experienced bleeding for the third day on the day before coming to the court, she might be a greater <i>zava</i>, who starts her clean days only the day after she arrived. In addition, any of the first seven days may be the last clean day, on which she has to immerse herself. The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> in both <b>this</b> case <b>and that</b> case she requires <b>seven</b> immersions to purify herself <b>from</b> the impurity of <b>menstruation, and eight</b> immersions to purify herself <b>from</b> the impurity of <b><i>ziva</i>.</b>",
            "The Gemara raises a further difficulty: If the woman comes <b>at night</b> to the court, she <b>requires eight</b> immersions to purify herself <b>from</b> her impurity of <b>menstruation.</b> Why does the <i>baraita</i> require her to immerse a total of only fifteen times when there are cases where she must immerse sixteen times?",
            "The Gemara answers: With regard to purifying herself from the impurity of <b><i>ziva</i>, which</b> can be taught in <b>a distinct</b> manner, <b>as there is no difference whether she comes before us during the day</b> and <b>there is no difference whether she comes before us at night,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>counts</b> the fixed amount of eight immersions. By contrast, with regard to purifying herself from <b>menstruation, which</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>cannot</b> teach in <b>a distinct</b> manner, <b>as when she comes before us at night she requires eight</b> immersions but if she comes before us <b>during the day</b> she does <b>not require eight</b> immersions, the <i>tanna</i> <b>did not count</b> both options, but mentioned only seven immersions, which is the minimum number required.",
            "The Gemara returns to the initial purpose of this discussion, which was to indicate that the Rabbis do not require all seven days of counting before the court. <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that <b>we require</b> seven days of <b>counting before us, why do I</b> need <b>all of these immersions? She</b> should <b>count seven</b> clean days <b>and</b> only <b>afterward immerse. Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from this</b> that the <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Akiva and <b>who say</b> that <b>we do not require</b> seven days of <b>counting before us?</b>",
            "<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Yosef, said to Rav Ashi,</b> in rejection of this proof: But <b>didn’t you resolve</b> a difficulty in the <i>baraita</i>? Since you admit that the <i>baraita</i> in any event requires revision, <b>resolve</b> this difficulty too, <b>and say this:</b> If a woman comes and says: <b>I counted</b> clean days <b>but I do not know how many</b> days <b>I counted,</b> and I do not know <b>whether I counted during the days of menstruation or whether I counted during the days of <i>ziva</i>,</b> the court instructs <b>her to immerse fifteen immersions.</b> If so, there is no proof that the Rabbis hold that the counting does not need to be before the court.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to this interpretation of the <i>baraita</i>: If it is referring to a case where the woman said: <b>I counted</b> clean days <b>but I do not know how many</b> days <b>I counted, it is impossible that she did not count at least one</b> clean <b>day.</b> If so, she should not be required to immerse on the eighth day, in which case <b>she is lacking</b> one <b>immersion,</b> as the <i>baraita</i> rules that she must immerse fifteen times.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, say</b> that she claims: <b>I do not know if I counted</b> any clean days <b>or I did not count</b> any clean days. Likewise, she does not know whether she saw the blood during her days of menstruation or during her days of <i>ziva</i>. Therefore, she must immerse fifteen times, as it is possible that she has not yet counted at all.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The corpses of <b>a <i>zav</i>, and a <i>zava</i>, and a menstruating woman, and a woman after childbirth, and a leper, who died, transmit ritual impurity by carrying</b> their corpses, <b>until the flesh decays.</b> With regard to the corpse of <b>a gentile who died,</b> although when alive he transmits impurity like a <i>zav</i>, once he dies he is <b>ritually pure</b> and is prevented <b>from transmitting impurity.</b>",
            "<b>Beit Shammai say:</b> The status of <b>all women</b> when they <b>die</b> is as though they were <b>menstruating women</b> at the time of death. Therefore, the garments that they were wearing before they died are impure and require immersion. <b>And Beit Hillel say: Only</b> a woman <b>who died</b> with the impurity of <b>a menstruating woman</b> has the status of <b>a menstruating woman</b> after death.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that the corpse of one of these impure people transmits ritual impurity by carrying. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does the mishna mean by the term: <b>By carrying? If we say</b> that it <b>literally</b> means <b>by carrying,</b> that is difficult: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>every</b> other <b>corpse does not impart ritual impurity by carrying?</b> Since every corpse imparts impurity through carrying, why does the mishna need to specify this <i>halakha</i> in these specific cases?",
            "<b>Rather, what</b> does the mishna mean when it states: <b>By carrying [<i>bemassa</i>]?</b> It means imparting impurity <b>through a very heavy stone [<i>even mesama</i>].</b> There is a unique <i>halakha</i> with regard to the ritual impurity of a <i>zav</i> and a menstruating woman. If they sit on an item, even one that cannot become ritually impure, and beneath that item there is a vessel, although the weight of the <i>zav</i> or the menstruating woman has no physical effect on the vessel, it becomes ritually impure.",
            "The Gemara notes that the word <i>mesama</i> is based on a verse, <b>as it is written: “And a stone was brought and placed [<i>vesumat</i>] upon the mouth of the den;</b> and the king sealed it with his own signet and with the signet of his lords, that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel” (Daniel 6:18). Accordingly, the mishna is teaching that although a corpse does not normally impart ritual impurity to vessels under a heavy stone, these specific types of corpses do transmit impurity in this manner.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that the Sages decreed that these specific types of corpses impart ritual impurity through a heavy stone? <b>Rav said:</b> It is <b>a decree</b> due to the possibility that <b>perhaps</b> one of these people might <b>faint</b> while sitting on the heavy stone, and it might be mistakenly thought they are dead and do not impart impurity to the vessels beneath.",
            "A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the Sages <b>said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer:</b> All of these types of corpses listed in the mishna impart ritual impurity through a heavy stone <b>until the belly</b> of the corpse <b>bursts.</b> The Sages imposed their decree only in cases where the corpse resembles a person who has fainted. Once the corpse is clearly no longer alive, it no longer imparts ritual impurity through a heavy stone.",
            "§ The mishna teaches: With regard to the corpse of <b>a gentile who died,</b> although when alive he transmits impurity like a <i>zav</i>, once he dies he is ritually pure and is prevented from transmitting impurity. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: For what</b> reason <b>did</b> the Sages <b>say</b> that the corpse of <b>a gentile who died is ritually pure</b> and is prevented <b>from transmitting impurity by carrying? Because his impurity</b> that he transmits even <b>when alive is not by Torah law, but by rabbinic law.</b> The Sages decreed that every living gentile imparts ritual impurity in the manner of a <i>zav</i>; they did not extend their decree to include the corpse of a gentile in the manner of the corpse of a <i>zav</i>.",
            "§ <b>The Sages taught: The</b> wise <b>people of Alexandria asked twelve matters of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥinnana.

            "The Gemara lists the questions. <b>Three</b> were <b>matters of wisdom:</b> The first question was with regard to <b>a <i>zav</i> and a <i>zava</i> and a menstruating woman and a woman after childbirth and the leper, who died: Until when do they transmit ritual impurity by carrying?</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them: Until the flesh decays.</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> taught in the mishna.",
            "The second question referred to the <b>daughter</b> of a wife who had been <b>sent away</b> by her husband, i.e., divorced, who then married another, but after her divorce from her second husband or his death she returned and remarried her first husband, to whom she is forbidden (see Deuteronomy 24:1–4), and a daughter was born from this marriage. <b>What</b> is <b>her,</b> i.e., the daughter’s, status <b>with regard to</b> marrying <b>a priest?</b>",
            "<b>Do we say an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>And if</b> in the case of <b>a widow</b> married <b>to a High Priest, whose prohibition does not apply to all,</b> i.e., it is prohibited for her only to marry a High Priest (see Leviticus 21:13–15), and yet the lineage of <b>her son is flawed,</b> as he is disqualified from the priesthood, then in the case of <b>this</b> daughter of a remarried divorcée, <b>whose prohibition applies equally to all</b> men, <b>is it not right that her son</b> should be of <b>flawed</b> lineage? <b>Or perhaps</b> this comparison can be refuted: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about a widow married to a High Priest?</b> It is notable in <b>that she herself is disqualified</b> from the priesthood, i.e., if a High Priest engages in intercourse with her she is disqualified from partaking of <i>teruma</i>, whereas a remarried divorcée is not disqualified from partaking of <i>teruma</i>.",
            "Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them:</b>"

By inference, <b>she,</b> the divorced wife, <b>is an abomination, but her children are not abominations.</b> In other words, if he transgressed the prohibition and remarried this woman, the daughters from that marriage are not disqualified from marrying priests.",
            "The third question was as follows: <b>Two</b> wealthy people who were <b>lepers</b> came to purify themselves and each brought a sin offering, a guilt offering, and a burnt offering. <b>Their offerings became intermingled with each other, and the offering of one of them was sacrificed, and</b> subsequently <b>one of them died.

If the other one had not died, they could both bring the remaining offering with the stipulation that it should be sacrificed on behalf of whoever is the owner. But now that one is dead, the other person may not bring the remaining animal, as one may not sacrifice a sin offering for one who is dead. He may also not bring another animal instead, as the animal that was already sacrificed might have been his, and one may not bring a second sin offering.",
            "Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them:</b> The solution is for him to <b>write</b> a contract giving all <b>his possessions to others,</b> whom he trusts to return them as a gift later, <b>and he is</b> then considered to be <b>destitute.

            "The Gemara challenges: <b>But there is</b> the <b>guilt offering</b> that a leper must bring, and this must be an animal not a bird, and may not be brought in a case of uncertainty. How can this leper bring his guilt offering? <b>Shmuel says:</b> Rabbi Yehoshua was referring specifically to a case <b>where his guilt offering</b> had already been <b>sacrificed,</b> before the animals became intermingled.",

Beit Hillel continued: <b>Rather,</b> you agree with us that the two are equated <b>to be stringent, but not to be lenient.</b> We say that <b>here too,</b> the two should be equated <b>to be stringent but not to be lenient.</b>",
            "§ <b>Rav Huna says,</b> in further clarification of Beit Shammai’s opinion: If a woman experiences bleeding during the eleven days of <i>ziva</i> and must observe one clean day, but did not wait until the conclusion of that second day before immersing, with regard to <b>her</b> items designated for <b>lying or sitting, on the second</b> day, <b>Beit Shammai render</b> them <b>impure</b> by rabbinic law. This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even though she has immersed</b> in a ritual bath and <b>even though she did not see</b> any blood after her immersion. <b>What is the reason? Since if she would see</b> blood <b>she</b> would <b>render</b> these surfaces <b>ritually impure</b> by Torah law, <b>now too she renders</b> them <b>ritually impure</b> by rabbinic law.",
            "<b>Rav Yosef said: What is</b> Rav Huna <b>teaching us? We</b> already <b>learn</b> in the mishna: If the woman <b>immersed on the day following</b> the eleventh day <b>and she engaged in intercourse with</b> the man of <b>her house</b> on that twelfth day <b>and then saw</b> blood, <b>Beit Shammai say: They transmit impurity</b> to items designated for <b>lying or sitting</b> by rabbinic law. <b>And they are exempt from</b> bringing <b>the</b> sin <b>offering.</b> Her impurity applies by rabbinic law, lest this case be confused with one where she experiences bleeding during the eleven days when she would be impure by Torah law. By inference, if she experienced bleeding on one of her eleven days and immersed on the following day, she would likewise render items designated for lying or sitting ritually impure by rabbinic law.",
            "<b>Rav Kahana said:</b> Rav Huna is teaching that Beit Shammai render her ritually impure even if she does not experience bleeding. Based on the mishna alone, one might have thought that the case where <b>she saw</b> blood <b>is different,</b> and it is only in this situation that Beit Shammai render her impure by rabbinic law.",
            "<b>Rav Yosef said,</b> in refutation of Rav Kahana’s claim: <b>And if she saw</b> blood on the twelfth day, <b>what of it?</b> A discharge of blood on the twelfth day <b>is a sighting of a menstruating woman,</b> which does not render her a <i>zava</i> by Torah law. Therefore, it is comparable to a case where she experienced bleeding on one day during her eleven days of <i>ziva</i> and immersed on the following day, and she does not experience bleeding on that following day at all.",
            "<b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: This is what</b> is <b>difficult for Rav Kahana: Granted,</b> in a case <b>where she saw</b> blood on the twelfth day, it stands to reason that <b>we decree</b> impurity with regard to <b>a sighting of a menstruating woman due to a sighting of a <i>zava</i>. But</b> in a case <b>where she did not see</b> any blood at all, for <b>what</b> reason should the Sages <b>decree</b> impurity <b>upon her?</b>",
            "Abaye continues: <b>And furthermore, we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Zavim</i> 1:1): If a man <b>sees one sighting of <i>ziva</i></b> (see 35b), <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> His status on the following day is <b>like</b> that of <b>a woman who observes</b> a clean <b>day for a day</b> she experiences a discharge. In other words, he must immerse and observe that day in purity, and if he touches tithes their status is suspended, since if he sees another discharge on that day, they are retroactively impure. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> His status is <b>like</b> that of a man <b>who experiences a seminal emission,</b> who is purified by his immersion, and therefore any tithes this man touches on the second day remain pure even if he later experiences a second discharge."
        ],
        [
            "<b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>moves the</b> discharge <b>seen</b> by a <i>zav</i> on the first day, <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> Due to the uncertainty, his status of ritual purity is <b>contingent</b> upon whether he sees another emission. If the <i>zav</i> sees a discharge a second time he will retroactively have been a full-fledged <i>zav</i> and his discharge renders one who moves it impure. But if he does not see another discharge he will remain like one who experienced a seminal emission, which means that his discharge does not render one who moves it impure. <b>And Beit Hillel deem</b> him <b>pure.</b> The discharge has the status of a seminal emission and does not transmit impurity to one who moves it.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: With regard to items designated for <b>lying or sitting</b> and their status <b>between the first sighting and the second sighting, Beit Shammai</b> say: Due to the uncertainty their status of ritual purity is <b>contingent</b> upon whether he sees another emission, <b>and Beit Hillel deem</b> them <b>pure.</b>",
            "Abaye explains Rav Kahana’s difficulty with Rav Huna’s opinion: It <b>is taught in the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> that if a man <b>sees one sighting of <i>ziva</i>, Beit Shammai say:</b> His status is <b>like</b> that of <b>a woman who observes</b> a clean <b>day for a day</b> she experiences a discharge. <b>Apparently, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai</b> the ritual purity status of <b>a woman who observes</b> a clean <b>day for a day</b> she experiences a discharge is <b>contingent</b> upon whether she experiences an emission of blood. This is difficult for Rav Huna, who explains that Beit Shammai hold that a woman who observes a clean day for each day of discharge is definitely impure, by rabbinic law.",
            "The Gemara answers that Rav Huna would explain: <b>Do not say</b> that his status is like that of <b>a woman who observes</b> a clean <b>day for a day. Rather, say</b> that he is <b>like one who engages in intercourse with a woman who observes</b> a clean <b>day for a day</b> after she has immersed. Rav Huna agrees that items designated for lying or sitting that this man sits or lies on is ritually impure only if she experiences bleeding before the end of the day.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> with regard to <b>him,</b> a man who engages in intercourse with a woman who is observing a clean day for a day, <b>that he does not transmit impurity</b> to items designated for <b>lying or sitting, and what is different</b> with regard to <b>her,</b> that woman herself, <b>that she</b> does <b>transmit impurity to</b> items designated for lying or sitting?",
            "The Gemara explains: With regard to <b>him, as he does not frequently</b> see <b>blood, the Sages did not issue a decree</b> rendering <b>him</b> impure to such an extent, if the woman has not seen blood on the second day. Whereas with regard to <b>her, as she does frequently</b> see <b>blood, the Sages did issue a decree</b> rendering her definitely impure to this degree.",
            "The Gemara further inquires: <b>And</b> since a decree was applied to her, as she commonly sees blood, <b>what is different</b> with regard to items designated for <b>lying or sitting, that she transmits impurity to them, and what is different</b> with regard to the <b>one who engages in intercourse</b> with her, <b>that she does not render him impure?</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: With regard to items designated for <b>lying or sitting, she renders them ritually impure because she frequently</b> sits or lies on them, whereas with regard to <b>one who engages in intercourse</b> with her, <b>which is not</b> nearly as <b>frequent,</b> she does <b>not render him ritually impure.</b>",
            "The Gemara raises another difficulty with regard to Rav Huna’s opinion. <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: If she saw blood on the eleventh day and observed part of a corresponding clean day and <b>immersed</b> on <b>the day following</b> the day that she saw blood <b>and engaged in intercourse</b> with her husband, <b>that is wayward conduct,</b> as the possibility exists that she will experience bleeding after intercourse that will be appended to the bleeding of the previous day, rendering her a <i>zava</i> and disqualifying the immersion.",
            "The mishna adds: And the status of ritually impure items with which <b>they came into contact and</b> the status of <b>their intercourse is contingent</b> upon whether she experiences bleeding on the day of her immersion. The Gemara explains the difficulty. <b>What, is it not</b> correct to say that <b>all,</b> i.e., Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, <b>agree</b> with this clause of the mishna? If so, Beit Shammai concur that this woman renders items impure only due to uncertainty. This is not in accordance with the statement of Rav Huna.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>No, this</b> clause of the mishna <b>is</b> only in accordance with the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said to Beit Hillel: Do you call this</b> type of behavior <b>wayward conduct? But he intended only to engage in intercourse with a menstruating woman.</b> The Gemara questions the meaning of Rabbi Yehuda’s statement. Can it <b>enter your mind</b> that he intended to engage in intercourse with <b>a menstruating woman?</b> The mishna and <i>baraita</i> are not referring to a man who engages in intercourse with a menstruating woman.",
            "<b>Rather, say</b> that Rabbi Yehuda meant that this man intended only <b>to engage in intercourse with a <i>zava</i>.</b> The Gemara rejects this formulation as well: Can it <b>enter your mind</b> that Rabbi Yehuda said he intended to engage in intercourse with <b>a <i>zava</i>?</b> The mishna and <i>baraita</i> are not referring to a man who engages in intercourse with a <i>zava</i> either. <b>Rather, say</b> that Rabbi Yehuda meant that this man intended <b>to engage in intercourse with a woman who observes</b> a clean <b>day for a day</b> she experiences a discharge. This <i>baraita</i> indicates that the latter clause of the mishna is only according to the opinion of Beit Hillel, as Rabbi Yehuda directed his comments specifically to them.",
            "§ The Gemara cites another discussion concerning a woman who experiences bleeding toward the end of her eleven days of <i>ziva</i>. <b>It was stated</b> with regard to a woman who experiences bleeding on the <b>tenth</b> day of her eleven days of <i>ziva</i>, that <b>Rav Yoḥanan says:</b> The <b>tenth</b> day is considered <b>like</b> the <b>ninth,</b> i.e., <b>just as</b> the <b>ninth</b> day <b>requires</b> the <b>observance</b> of a day clean from discharges on the following day, <b>so too does</b> the <b>tenth</b> day <b>require observance</b> of a day in case she experiences bleeding on the eleventh day.",
            "<b>Reish Lakish says:</b> The <b>tenth</b> day is considered <b>like</b> the <b>eleventh</b> day, as in such a case it is impossible for her to experience bleeding for the three consecutive days within the eleven days of <i>ziva</i>. <b>Just as</b> the <b>eleventh</b> day <b>does not require</b> the <b>observance</b> of a day clean from discharges, <b>so too</b> the <b>tenth</b> day <b>does not require</b> the <b>observance</b> of a day clean from discharges, since even if she experiences bleeding on both the eleventh and the twelfth days, the last of the three consecutive days was already the start of her days of menstruation, and therefore she does not become a greater <i>zava</i>.",
            "<b>There are</b> those <b>who teach</b> the dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish <b>with regard to this</b> case: <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya said to Rabbi Akiva: Even</b> if <b>you</b> were to <b>amplify</b> and derive <i>halakhot</i> from the repeated terms <b>“in oil,” “in oil,”</b> stated with regard to the thanks offering (see Leviticus 7:12) <b>for the entire day, I</b> would <b>not listen to you</b> and accept your claim. <b>Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>one-half of a <i>log</i></b> is the requisite amount of <b>oil for</b> the <b>thanks offering, and</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>one-quarter</b> of a <i>log</i> is the amount of <b>wine for a nazirite, and</b> the <i>halakha</i> that a woman who experiences an emission of blood during the <b>eleven days that are between</b> one period of <b>menstruation and</b> the next period of <b>menstruation</b> is a <i>zava</i>, each of these is <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai.</b> None of the <i>halakhot</i> are derived from verses.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the <b><i>halakha</i></b> mentioned here with regard to the eleven days between one period of menstruation and the next? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is referring to the <b><i>halakha</i></b> that distinguishes the first ten days from the <b>eleventh</b> day. <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> It is referring to two <b><i>halakhot</i></b> that distinguish the first ten days from the <b>eleventh.</b>",
            "The Gemara elaborates: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that this is referring to the <b><i>halakha</i></b> which distinguishes the first ten days from the <b>eleventh. It is</b> the <b>eleventh that does not require</b> the <b>observance</b> of a day clean from discharges, <b>but for the other</b> ten days she must <b>perform observance. And Reish Lakish says:</b> It is referring to two <b><i>halakhot</i></b> that distinguish the first ten days from the <b>eleventh.</b> The <b>eleventh</b> day <b>does not require observance, and it does not</b> serve as a day of <b>observance for the tenth</b> day, i.e., the tenth day also does not require observance. The tenth day does not require observing since day eleven is excluded from being a day of observation for the previous day.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya’s claim that the eleven days of <i>ziva</i> is a <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai.

            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>to include</b> a case where she experiences bleeding on the <b>eleventh</b> day after her days of menstruation? <b>The verse states: “Not in the time of her menstruation”</b> (Leviticus 15:25).

            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that a woman is impure as a <i>zava</i> if she experiences bleeding for <b>three</b> consecutive <b>days.

            "One might have thought that one who engages in intercourse with a <i>zav</i> has the same status as one who engages in intercourse with a <i>zava</i>.

            "The Gemara explains the difficulty from this <i>baraita</i>: <b>Evidently,</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of the eleven days of <i>ziva</i> <b>are</b> derived from <b>verses</b> and are not a <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai.
