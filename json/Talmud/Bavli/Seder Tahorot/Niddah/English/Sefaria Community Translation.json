Hillel says, From [a more recent] check (where she is found to be ritually impure) to [an earlier] check (where she is found to be ritually pure, all terumot and taharot handled will be retroactively declared impure), and even where there are many days [in between checks].",

Rather a twenty four hour period can reduce (a longer than twenty four hour period) between two checks, and a period between two checks (that is less than twenty four hours) can reduce a twenty four hour period.",

And a woman who uses cloths [to perform a check (i.e. bedikah) at the time of intercourse], this counts as a [valid] check (i.e. bedikah) [for the purposes of determining which terumot and taharot are retroactively ritually impure], and [such a check] can reduce a twenty four hour period as well as period of time in between two checks (i.e. bedikot) [that is less than twenty four hours].",

[Shammai] reasons, \"Maintain the woman on her status, and the woman [in our Mishnah] has a status of ritual purity.\" And Hillel [reasons], \"When [we] say 'maintain something on its status', [that] is where it does not have an inherent disqualification.

            "As to Reish Lakish, how does he expound Rabby Yohanan's text?  He requires it for the same exposition as that made Rabbi Hannina bar Pappa.  For Rabbi Hannina bar Pappa made the following exposition:  The name of the angel who is in charge of conception is \"Night\", and he takes up a drop and places it in the presence of the Holy One, Blessed is He, saying, \"Sovreign of the Universe, what shall be the fate of this drop?  Shall it produce a strong man or a weak man, a wise man or a fool, a rich man or a poor man?\" Whereas 'wicked' or 'righteous' he does not mention, in agreement with the view of Rabbi Hannina.  For Rabbi Hannina stated:  Everything is in the hands of heaven, except the fear of God, as it says, \"An now Israel, what does the Lord your God require of you, but to fear, etc.\" (Deuteronomy 10:12)"
