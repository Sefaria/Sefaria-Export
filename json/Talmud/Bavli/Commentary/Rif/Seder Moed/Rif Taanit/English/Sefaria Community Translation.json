            "From when do we start mentioning [G-d's] strength of rain [giving in the Amidah]? Rabbi Eliezer says, \"From the first holiday of Sukkot.\" Rabbi Yehoshua says, \"From the last holiday of Sukkot (ie. Shmini Atzeret).\" Rabbi Yehoshua said to him, \"Seeing as the rain is not a sign of blessing on Sukkot, why is it mentioned?\" Rabbi Eliezer said to him, \"Even he [who follows my opinion] only says, 'He who makes the wind blow and makes the rain fall'- in its season.\" He said to him, \"If so, than it should always be mentioned.\"", 
            "Gemara: Regarding dew and wind, the Sages did not obligate to mention; but if he wants to mention, he mentions. What is the reasoning? Rabbi Chanina said, \"Because they do not stop [whereas rain has a set season].\" (Daf Gimmel, Amud Bet) Rabbi Chanina said, \"In the summer, if he said 'He who makes the wind blow,' we do not make him return; if he said 'He who makes the rain fall,' we make him return. In the winter, if he did not say 'He who makes the wind blow,' we do not make him return; if he did not say, 'He who makes the rain fall,' we make him return. Additionally, even if he said, 'He who makes the wind pass and makes the dew bloom [instead of 'He who makes the wind blow and makes the dew fall']', we do not make him return.\" Yerushalmi: Rabbi Ze'ira [said] in the name of Rabbi Chanina, \"If he was standing in the rain and he mentioned dew, we do not make him return; if he was standing in the dew and mentioned rain, we make him return.\" But wasn't it taught [in a Baraita], \"Regarding dew and wind, the Sages did not obligate to mention; but if he wants to mention, he mentions?\""
