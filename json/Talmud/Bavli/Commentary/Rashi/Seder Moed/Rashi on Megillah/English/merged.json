And the villages are not experts in reading, and need one of the men of the city to read for them, and the Sages didn't burden them to make them come later, so they come on the day of the 14th and sometimes on the day of entry on the 13th and sometimes it is the 11th.

And how do we know that it is to these that the Psalm refers? Because it says in this chapter (of Psalms) \"He lies in wait in a secret place as a lion in his lair, he lies in wait to ambush the poor.\" But do robbers wait to ambush the poor? Is it not the rich that they ambush? Thus it is clear that this psalm is talking about speculators, who are mainly focused on the poor. And on this matter, David asked for G-d's mercy: \"Break the arms of the wicked,\" and let the world be granted satiety, and in that way his arm will be broken, and he will not find his evil, the wickedness that he had in mind to do, you will not find it, for he will not be able to do it.
