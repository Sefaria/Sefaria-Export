                "And if you will say that the Rabbanim, [arguing on Rabbi Eliezer] who say that he cannot go back in, even if he is only 1 handbreadth outside the Shabbos boundary, [and] even though the 4 handbreadths of his personal boundary overlap inside his original Shabbos boundary, [that they would say] here too: even if a wall of people could extend [from where Rav Nechemiah is standing] to inside the boundary, he cannot return -- [we can resolve that difficulty] by saying that it is not similar [to the dispute between Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbanim], because here, when the wall of people disperses, and he has already gone out of the 4 handbreadths the sages gave him [when he went outside the original Shabbos boundary] -- now it would be necessary to give him another 4 handbreadths boundary.  But since he is now back in his original Shabbos boundary, he is not given another 4 handbreadths, rather he returns to his original Shabbos boundary [of 2,000 handbreadths].  But in case where he does not lose his [new boundary of] 4 handbreadths by walking back in [to the original Shabbos boundary] -- he cannot return [to the original boundary].\n"

                "Because if he [Rav Nachman] was speaking of a case where there were not enough people, what question could you have? --  And even though Rabbi Meir invalidates an animal for [use] as a wall for the Sukkah [as the Gemara brings in the] upcoming [section], it was obvious to Rava that the Halakha follows Rabbi Yehuda's opinion [who permits using an animal] (and, a fortiori, Rabbi Yehuda permits using people as well).  ",

                "But we cannot explain [the basis Rava's rationale] that, regarding [using] people [for a wall], even Rabbi Meir agrees that [the basis for prohibiting an animal is due to] its propensity to run away does not apply to people [when used as a wall].  Because [in the final analysis] this [reason of propensity to run away], was not Rabbi Meir's reason [for prohibiting an animal], as the Gemara concludes in the chapter \"The One Who Sleeps\" (Sukkah 23a).  ",
                "And [although] the Gemara investigates in the upcoming section by questioning whether we learned that Rabbi Meir explicitly prohibits using people and implements [to create a valid Sukkah wall], this [question is posed from the point of view] of the one [Amora] who explains in the Gemara Sukkah, that the reason for Rabbi Meir's prohibition is [solely due to the fact that] we are concerned that perhaps the animal will run away."
