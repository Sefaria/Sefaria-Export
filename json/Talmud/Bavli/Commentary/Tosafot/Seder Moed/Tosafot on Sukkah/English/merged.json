                "Talmud - How much larger is [the area of] a square than a circle - one fourth",
                "Tosafot - This cannot be proven from the fact that a square of 3x3 has a perimeter of 12 surrounding it, and a circle with a diameter of 3 has a circumference of (approximately) 9 surrounding it as [according to the Talmud's calculation] a circle with a circumference of 3 has a diameter of 1. (Our hypothesis is that any shape's area is equal to it's perimeter or circumference. If this is so, then the Talmud's conjecture is seemingly proved, as the square's perimeter is 1/4 larger than the circle's circumference and they have the same distance across (3).]",
                "[Why is this not a proof -] As proof cannot be brought from the perimeter/circumference [of a shape] to its area. [For example, according to the hypothesis that the perimeter/circumference of a shape is equal to its area,] you would think that a circle with a diameter of 4 would have the area of only as much as a square of 3x3, since their perimeter/circumference is equal (the square is 3 per side, thus it's perimeter is 3x4=12, and the circle's circumference is 12 as we multiply its diameter, 4, by 3. However, [in truth,] when you divide a square of 3x3 into a grid of 3 strips horizontally and 3 strips vertically, you will only find 9 square cubits (see diagram). But a circle with a diameter of 4 must have 12 strips of one square cubit each. For a square of 4x4, when it is divided into 4 strips of a cubit's width along it's height, and also along it's width, will result in 16 strips of one square cubit. And if [as the Talmud conjectures] a square is only one fourth larger than a circle, it comes out that you are saying that a circle [with a corresponding diameter of 4] has an area of 12 square cubits. (Thus we find that a circle and square can have the same perimeter/circumference, 12, and still have different areas - the square has 9 but the circle has 12.) Rather, [we must say] that there is no proof from the circumference/perimeter [to the area] at all."

                "Tosafot - This calculation is not precise, as there is an additional small amount (of diagonal). [To prove this point -]",
                "If you draw a square of 10x10 and divide it into a grid, you will have four sub-squares of 5x5. If you then draw a line across the diagonal of each of these sub-squares, with the lines meeting in the middle of the sides of the large square (see diagram), you will then have an inner square of 50 amos inside the large 10x10 square. [We know that this inner square] is 50 amos in area since you divided each of the 5x5 squares in half along their diagonal.",
                "[However,] if you use the [Talmud's] calculation of 1 2/5 amos [diagonal per ama of length], it will result in an inner square of 7x7 (as each sub-square is 5x5, it's diagonal will be 5x1.4=7). Therefore, the inner square would not have the area of half of the outer square, as a square of 7x7 only has an area of 49 square amos. [But as proved earlier,] the inner square actually has an area of 50, as it has half the area of the large square of 10x10, which has an area of 100."

                "The messengers of Mitzvah ... Those who travel to fulfill a Mitzvah, for example to learn Torah or to greet his Torah teacher and to redeem captives are exempt from Suka, and even at the time of their encampment (to rest). So is explained in the notes of Rash\"i and so is implied by the Gemora because it says: \"Those who travel to fulfill a Mitzvah are exempt from Suka, whether during the day or during the night\". It implies (that they are exempt from Suka) even if they don't travel except during the day. Because, if (the Gemora was talking about the case where) they went on traveling during the day and during the night, even (if they would have gone) for a permitted non-Mitzvah activity, they would be also exempt (from Suka), as was thought in a Brisa. And also (another example of being exempt from Suka even when not directly involved in doing a Mitzva), a story with Rav Chizda and Raba bar bar Huna that were resting on the shore of Sura river (outside of Suka), (when they came to hear a Torah exposition and to visit the Leader of the Exile - Rash'i). Toisfos continue: and it is a wonder, if they are able to fulfill both (i.e. the Mitzvah that they are currently involved in, and the Mitzvah of Suka), why are they exempt (from Suka)? Just because a person has Tzitzis on his garment and Tfilin on his head, who would exempt him with this from the rest of the Mitzvahs? (obviously nobody).  Toisfos continue: and in the chapter \"Ein Bein Hamoder\" [Nidorim chapter 4, page 33b], in regard to the one who swore against getting benefit (from the owner of the lost object), that he (the finder, nevertheless,) returns to him (to the owner of the lost object) his lost object, even though he (the finder) benefits a Pruta (a small amount of money, according to the opinion) of Rav Yosef. (Rav Yosef holds in Meseches Bava Kama, bottom of the page 56b that a finder of a lost objects benefits from the lost object by being exempt from giving a piece of bread to a poor man who knacks on his door while the finder is involved in the Mitzvah of lost object, thus, saving to the finder the value of that piece of bread).  (The finder, despite of getting the benefit, should return the object) because it is not a  frequent event (that a poor man would knock on the door while the finder  is involved in the Mitzvah of lost object). (However) if all the time that the lost object is in his (finder's) house, he (the finder) is exempt from giving bread to a poor man, if it is so, it is a frequent event (saving the value of a piece of bread, because poor people knocking on the door, while the object is in his house, are frequent). Rather, for sure, his is not exempt (from giving bread) except at the time that he is involved with it (with the lost object). For example, lost Talis and he (the finder) spreads it for its needs (to air it out), or an animal when he gives to it food. It is not frequent that at that moment would come a poor man to ask from him (bread). The Toisfos conclude: It is needed to be said that here to (in the case of travelers to do Mitzvah and in the case of Rav Chizda and Raba bar bar Huna traveling to visit the Leader of Exile)  they are talking about a case like this one (i.e. these two cases of travelers are similar to the case of a lost object at the moment of taking care of it, in a way) that if they (the travelers) would bother themselves to fulfill the Mitzvah of Suka, they would be detracted from (their original) Mitzvahs. (i.e. if they look for a Sukah it, for example, may take longer for them to arrive to their destinations to fulfill the original Mitzvah. To summarize, it seems from this Toisfos that the principle Osek Be Mitzvah Potur min Ha Mitzvah, the one who is involved in one Mitzvah is exempt from another Mitzvah, applies only when the involvement with the second Mitzvah is detrimental in some way to the original Mitzvah).
