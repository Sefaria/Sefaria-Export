            "...There is a question to be asked here. (Although there is disagreement over the calendar date of the giving of the Torah,) Everyone agrees that the Torah was given on the 51st day of the Counting of the Omer. The intention here was that since the Jewish People were not prepared to receive the wisdom of the Torah until they purified and sanctified themselves  from the impurity of Egypt, as is written in Pirkei Avos, “All whose fear of Heaven precedes his wisdom, his wisdom will be upheld.” Therefore, since the purity happened on the 50th day, Hashem established the 50th day as the Holiday of Shavuos because fear of Heaven comes before wisdom.
