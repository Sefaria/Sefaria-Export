                "Before the idols of idolaters three days it is forbidden to negotiate with them to lend them and ask them. And after the time Rabbi Ishmael says that three before them and three after them are forbidden, and the Ecclesiastes before their idols are forbidden after their idols are permitted. It is forbidden to negotiate with them. In the negotiations of bargaining and selling, this is proven from the interpretation that Kaman interpreted in Pirkin, because he is a dazil and a mummy for idolatry, and it is forbidden because he will not hear from you. But rather in the case of a middy dhazi, for the sacrifice of your words, it is written, Because he says that helping him with his idolatry according to his needs and the more difficult is that he does not have to deal with them because of the welfare or because before the skin it will not give an obstacle and interpret it because the welfare is drowsy and woeful and moody, and it is not difficult to say, A beast for its children, etc. And Amai did not command an antiaircraft in the hands of a man who is not worthy of sacrifice. And that he should be asked to accompany them, and to accompany them from them. He asked him, \"What is the thing of Israel?\" He needs him and Zil and Moody, but in the negotiations of bargaining and selling, he did not think that he was profitable. Like his smell and even when he buys, he still does not know if he will profit from it and when he is familiar, he is worried that he will take out the money before he finds another commodity and not Azil and Moody and the late Rambam writes that D'Isor took from them everything that the coins are held in his hand, To sell them something worthy of the \"star worship\" and to take money from them and give them their alternates and make them to them The island of Dasro to sell them from Hadzi to the starry work because of the welfare that he has a lot to sacrifice for idolatry he sacrifices in profit and from the best and praises his idolatrous work, which is invited to sacrifice with distinction and from the finest and that he has properly sacrificed it is forbidden to sell him or Dalma precisely because before and after skin A woman who is a member of the rabbinical court in the baritah of דרב זביד is required to do something that does not exist but does not take them from them לאו במקח אירי only with the receipt of דורון דומיא דימוא הטם משנא דינה קיסרינא to רב יהודה נשיאה and to פשישי \"שפי ' To sell him and Azil and Modi is difficult Negotiate because welfare is Dltama Dlfni skin Emei no Lokhin them and YL fraiche Dlsat and give Dmtni not only the sale and remnants of best means to carry them coins and let them bargain but not taking banned \"Give Dstm is familiar sadness. And in the case of the \"פרישי\" דכ\"ל when they said that it is forbidden to negotiate with them, they did not say anything but In the matter that takes place but something that does not exist is permissible, and in each one of them there is one side permit and one side prohibition of anything that exists is forbidden to know and it is permissible to take and something that is not fulfilled is forbidden to be taken and permitted to sell. According to the fact that there is also the taking of the other side and the prohibition aspect, the baraita does not invalidate the law for taking, and in the beritha of a raven zevi דיפור דין לקניה ושתיה לפרשת Rashi In the negotiations of bargaining and selling, there is in the sale a prohibition and a permit side, as well as a trick and a parakeet. There is no difference between these two דיכיון דמתאוו to the מוכר שמח and זעיל and מודי even though he explained that דמקמח and ממכר does not belong אזיל and מודי does not belong to אזיל ומודי It is actually without interest, but in the interest it is permitted to do so, and not to eat it, and to recite it, In this case it is not possible to say that it is necessary for the נעות ממעות to be ממעו קט a little \"Samuel said in the Diaspora is not forbidden, but only the day of idols.

On the day of their idols, it is permissible to allow them, and Aviel, because our most precious livelihood is from them, and we bear and enjoy with them all the year of the year, so that we will not be separated from them on the day of their idyll. Lachish Kammiah said, \"Let us make it into its hands, and we shall not consider it.\" Before him"
