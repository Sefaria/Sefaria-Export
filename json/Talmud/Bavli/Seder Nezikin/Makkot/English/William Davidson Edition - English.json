            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>How are witnesses rendered conspiring</b> witnesses? This applies in a case where two witnesses came before the court and said: <b>We testify with regard to so-and-so,</b> who is a priest, <b>that he is the son of a divorced woman or the son of a <i>ḥalutza</i>,</b> a <i>yevama</i> who performed the rite of <i>ḥalitza</i> to free herself from the levirate bond. Those testimonies render him a <i>ḥalal</i> (see Leviticus 21:6–7), one disqualified from the priesthood due to flawed lineage. If a second set of witnesses testifies in court and renders the first set conspiring witnesses, <b>one does not say</b> with regard to each of the conspiring witnesses: <b>This</b> witness <b>shall be rendered the son of a divorced woman or the son of a <i>ḥalutza</i> in his stead. Rather, he receives forty lashes</b> as punishment for his false testimony.",
            "Likewise, in a case where two witnesses came before the court and said: <b>We testify with regard to so-and-so that he is liable to be exiled</b> to a city of refuge for unwittingly killing another (see Numbers 35:11), and a second set of witnesses testifies in court and renders the first set conspiring witnesses, <b>one does not say</b> with regard to each of the conspiring witnesses: <b>This</b> witness <b>shall be exiled in his stead. Rather, he receives forty lashes.</b>",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara analyzes the opening question of the mishna: <b>But</b> based on the cases discussed in the mishna, the <i>tanna</i> <b>should have</b> asked: <b>How are witnesses not rendered conspiring</b> witnesses? The standard punishment for conspiring witnesses is the punishment that they conspired to have inflicted upon the subject of their testimony. The mishna cites anomalous cases where their punishment does not correspond to the punishment they sought to have inflicted. The Gemara asks: <b>And furthermore, from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> in a mishna cited <b>later</b> (5a): <b>But</b> if the second set of witnesses attempting to render the first set conspiring witnesses <b>said to them: How</b> can <b>you testify</b> to that incident when <b>on that day you were with us in such and such place, these</b> first witnesses <b>are conspiring</b> witnesses. One learns <b>by inference</b> from the final phrase in the cited passage: These are conspiring witnesses, that <b>those</b> enumerated in the mishna here <b>are not conspiring</b> witnesses.",
            "The Gemara answers both questions: <b>The <i>tanna</i> is standing there</b> in his studies, at the end of tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i>, which immediately precedes <i>Makkot</i>, and <i>Makkot</i> is often appended to the end of <i>Sanhedrin</i>. The mishna there teaches (89a): <b>All</b> those <b>who are</b> rendered <b>conspiring witnesses are led to</b> be executed with <b>the same</b> mode of <b>execution</b> with which they conspired to have their victim executed, <b>except for conspiring</b> witnesses who testified that <b>the daughter of a priest and her paramour</b> committed adultery, where the daughter of the priest would be executed by burning (see Leviticus 21:9) and her paramour would be executed by strangulation. In <b>that</b> case, they are <b>not taken directly to</b> be executed with <b>the same</b> mode of <b>execution</b> that they sought to have inflicted on the woman; <b>rather,</b> they are executed with <b>a different</b> mode of <b>execution,</b> the one they sought to have inflicted on the paramour.",
            "Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> continues in this first mishna in <i>Makkot</i>: <b>And there are other conspiring witnesses with regard to whom</b> the court <b>does not apply the <i>halakhot</i></b> governing the punishment in standard cases of <b>conspiring</b> testimony <b>at all,</b> and they do not receive the punishment they sought to have inflicted. <b>Rather,</b> they receive <b>forty lashes. How,</b> and in what cases, is this applied? This is applied in a case where two witnesses came before the court and said: <b>We testify with regard to so-and-so that he is the son of a divorced woman or the son of a <i>ḥalutza</i>, one does not say</b> with regard to each of the conspiring witnesses: <b>This</b> witness <b>shall be rendered the son of a divorced woman or the son of a <i>ḥalutza</i> in his stead. Rather, he receives forty lashes.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived that the court does not punish the witnesses with the punishment they sought to have inflicted and disqualify them from the priesthood? <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says:</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as the verse states: “And you shall do to him as he conspired”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:19), from which the Gemara infers: It is done <b>“to him,” but not to his offspring.</b> Rendering the witness a <i>ḥalal</i> would disqualify his offspring as well. The Gemara challenges: <b>Let</b> the court <b>invalidate</b> the witness <b>and not invalidate his offspring.</b> The Gemara explains: That too would not accord with the directive in the verse, as based on the verse <b>we require</b> that the punishment be <b>“as he conspired to do”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:19), <b>and</b> that is <b>not</b> the case here, as the witness conspired to disqualify the subject of his testimony and his offspring.",
            "<b>Bar Padda says</b> that this alternative form of punishment is derived through <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If one who</b> actually <b>disqualifies</b> another from the priesthood, i.e., a priest who fathers a son with a divorcée disqualifies their son from the priesthood, <b>is not</b> himself <b>disqualified</b> from the priesthood, so too with regard to this witness <b>who came to disqualify</b> another from the priesthood but was unsuccessful <b>and did not disqualify</b> him because he was rendered a conspiring witness, <b>isn’t it logical that he should not be disqualified? Ravina objects to this</b> reasoning: <b>If so,</b> that the failure of the conspiring witnesses to achieve their objective is the consideration at the basis of the <i>a fortiori</i> inference, <b>you have</b> thereby <b>rendered the <i>halakha</i> of conspiring witnesses obsolete,</b> as one could claim:"
        ],
        [
            "<b>If one who stones</b> another, i.e., who testified that another is liable to be executed via the death penalty of stoning and was rendered a conspiring witness after that person was executed, <b>is not stoned,</b> as the <i>halakha</i> is that conspiring witnesses receive the punishment that they conspired to have inflicted and not the punishment that they actually had inflicted, then with regard to a conspiring witness <b>who came to stone</b> another <b>and</b> was unsuccessful <b>and did not stone</b> him, as he was rendered a conspiring witness before that person was executed, <b>isn’t it logical that he should not be stoned?</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>Rather, it is clear as we answered initially:</b> “And you shall do to him as he conspired”; this should be done to him, but not to his offspring.",
            "§ The mishna teaches that in a case where two witnesses came before the court and said: <b>We testify with regard to so-and-so that he is liable to</b> be punished with <b>exile,</b> one does not say that these witnesses shall be exiled in his stead; rather, they receive forty lashes. The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as the verse states</b> with regard to an unwitting killer: <b>“And he shall flee to one of the cities”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:5), and the Gemara infers: <b>He</b> shall flee, <b>but conspiring</b> witnesses shall <b>not.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is derived through <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If</b> the killer, <b>who performed an action</b> that, had he done so <b>intentionally, he would not be exiled</b> for it even if he were not sentenced to death, e.g., because there was no forewarning, then in the case of the conspiring witnesses, <b>who did not perform an action,</b> as their conspiracy was exposed and their testimony rejected, even if they testified <b>intentionally, isn’t it logical that they should not be exiled?</b>",
            "The Gemara challenges: <b>But that</b> distinction <b>provides</b> support to the contrary. <b>Could this not</b> be derived through <b>logical inference?</b> With regard to <b>one who performed an action,</b> i.e., killed a person, if he did so <b>intentionally, let</b> him <b>not be exiled so that he will not have atonement</b> for his action, and he will instead receive harsh punishment at the hand of Heaven. With regard to the conspiring witnesses, <b>who did not perform an action,</b> even if they testified <b>intentionally, let them also be exiled so that they will have atonement</b> for their misdeed. The Gemara concludes: <b>Rather, it is clear in accordance with</b> the explanation <b>of Reish Lakish:</b> “And he shall flee to one of the cities”; he, but not conspiring witnesses.",
            "§ <b>Ulla says: From where</b> is <b>an allusion in the Torah to conspiring witnesses</b> derived? The Gemara asks: Is <b>an allusion to conspiring witnesses</b> required? <b>But isn’t it written</b> explicitly: <b>“And you shall do to him as he conspired”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:19)? <b>Rather,</b> Ulla’s question is: <b>From where</b> is <b>an allusion in the Torah to</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>that conspiring witnesses are flogged</b> in certain cases derived? It is derived from that <b>which is written:</b> “If there is a quarrel between people and they come to judgment, and the judges judge them, <b>and they vindicated the righteous and condemned the wicked, and it shall be if the wicked is deserving of lashes”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:1–2). Ostensibly, this verse is difficult: Is it <b>due to</b> the fact that <b>“they vindicated the righteous”</b> that they <b>“condemned the wicked, and it shall be if the wicked is deserving of lashes”?</b> In most disputes, the fact that one party is vindicated does not necessarily lead to lashes for the other party.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the verse is addressing the case of <b>witnesses who,</b> through their testimony, <b>condemned the righteous, and other witnesses came and vindicated the original righteous</b> person <b>and rendered these</b> first set of witnesses <b>wicked</b> conspiring witnesses. In that case, the verse states: <b>“And it shall be if the wicked is deserving of lashes,”</b> indicating that lashes are an appropriate punishment for conspiring witnesses.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why not <b>derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> that conspiring witnesses are liable to receive lashes <b>from</b> the prohibition: <b>“You shall not bear</b> false witness against your neighbor” (Exodus 20:13)? The Gemara answers: One is not flogged for violating that prohibition, <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that it is a prohibition that does not involve an action,</b> as one violates it through speech, not action, <b>and</b> the principle is: For <b>every prohibition that does not involve an action, one is not flogged for its</b> violation. Therefore, it was necessary to derive the <i>halakha</i> from the verse: “And they vindicated the righteous.”",
            "§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Four matters were stated with regard to conspiring witnesses,</b> i.e., there are four cases in which their punishment deviates from the norm. <b>They are not rendered the son of a divorced woman or the son of a <i>ḥalutza</i>; they are not exiled to a city of refuge; they do not pay the ransom</b> if they testified that the forewarned ox of someone killed another; <b>and they are not sold as a Hebrew slave</b> in a case where they testified that one stole property and he would be sold into slavery if he lacked the means to repay the owner. The Sages <b>said in the name of Rabbi Akiva: They also do not pay based on their own</b> admission. If they were rendered conspiring witnesses in one court, and before that court managed to collect the payment that they owed, they appeared in a different court and admitted that they had been rendered conspiring witnesses, they are exempt from payment.",
            "The Gemara elaborates: <b>They are not rendered the son of a divorced woman or the son of a <i>ḥalutza</i>, as we stated</b> and explained earlier. <b>And they are not exiled to a city of refuge, as we stated</b> and explained earlier. <b>And they do not pay the ransom,</b> as these Sages <b>hold</b> that <b>the ransom</b> paid by one whose ox killed another is <b>atonement</b> for him, as he is liable for the actions of his animal, and it is not payment of damages. <b>And these</b> conspiring witnesses <b>are not subject to</b> a need for <b>atonement,</b> as their ox did not kill anyone.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> that <b>the ransom</b> is <b>atonement? Rav Ḥisda says: It is Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse concerning a case where the ox of one person gored another: “If ransom is imposed upon him, <b>and he shall give the redemption of his soul”</b> (Exodus 21:30); the term “his soul” means <b>the value of the victim,</b> i.e., the owner of the ox must pay the heirs of the deceased his value as it would be assessed were he sold as a slave in the market. <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says:</b> The term “his soul” means <b>the value of the one liable for the damage. What, is it not</b> that <b>they disagree with regard to this</b> principle: <b>That</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that <b>the ransom</b> is <b>monetary restitution</b> for the damage that his ox caused the victim; <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yishmael, <b>holds</b> that <b>the ransom</b> is <b>atonement,</b> as he thereby redeems his own soul from death at the hand of Heaven?",
            "<b>Rav Pappa says: No,</b> perhaps <b>everyone agrees</b> that <b>the ransom</b> is <b>atonement, and here,</b> it is <b>with regard to this</b> matter that <b>they disagree:</b> One <b>Sage,</b> the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that <b>we assess</b> the payment <b>in</b> terms of the value <b>of</b> the <b>victim; and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yishmael, <b>holds</b> that <b>we assess</b> the payment <b>in</b> terms of the value <b>of</b> the <b>one liable for the damage.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of the Rabbis,</b> who abandon the straightforward meaning of the verse? The Rabbis derive it in the following manner: <b>Imposition is stated below</b> with regard to one whose ox killed another: “If ransom is imposed upon him” (Exodus 21:30), <b>and imposition is stated above,</b> in the case of one who struck a pregnant woman, causing her to miscarry: “He shall be punished, as the husband of the woman imposes upon him” (Exodus 21:22). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the miscarriage, it is <b>in</b> terms of the value <b>of</b> the <b>victim,</b> the fetus, that we assess the payment, <b>here too,</b> in the case of the ransom, it is <b>in</b> terms of the value <b>of</b> the <b>victim</b> that we assess the payment.",
            "<b>And Rabbi Yishmael,</b> son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says: <b>“And he shall give the redemption of his soul” is written,</b> indicating that the sum is based on the value of the one seeking atonement. <b>And the Rabbis</b> explain: <b>Yes,</b> the phrase <b>“redemption of his soul” is written,</b> and the payment functions to redeem his soul. <b>Nevertheless, when we assess</b> the sum of the redemption payment, it is <b>in</b> terms of the value <b>of</b> the <b>victim</b> that <b>we assess</b> the payment.",
            "§ The <i>baraita</i> teaches: Conspiring witnesses <b>are not sold as a Hebrew slave</b> in a case where they testified that one stole property. <b>Rav Hamnuna thought to say: This statement</b> applies only in a case where the falsely accused <b>has</b> means <b>of his own</b> to repay the sum of the alleged theft, <b>as since,</b> had the testimony been true, <b>he would not have been sold</b> for his transgression, the witnesses too are <b>not sold</b> when they are rendered conspiring witnesses. <b>But</b> in a case <b>where</b> the falsely accused <b>does not have</b> means <b>of his own,</b> and would have been sold into slavery had their testimony been accepted, <b>even if</b> the witnesses <b>have</b> means <b>of their own, they are sold,</b> as they sought to have slavery inflicted upon him.",
            "<b>Rava said to him: And let</b> the witnesses <b>say to</b> the person against whom they testified: <b>If you had</b> money, <b>would you have been sold? We too will not be sold.</b> Since they have the means, they can pay the sum that they owe and not be sold as slaves. <b>Rather,</b> the Gemara proposes an alternative formulation of the statement of Rav Hamnuna. <b>Rav Hamnuna thought to say: This statement</b> applies only in a case <b>where either he,</b> the falsely accused, <b>or they,</b> the witnesses, <b>have</b> the means to pay the sum; <b>but</b> in a case <b>where neither he nor they have</b> the means, the witnesses <b>are sold.</b> In that case, had their testimony stood, the alleged thief would have been sold into slavery, and they too lack the means to pay the sum that they are liable to pay as conspiring witnesses. Therefore, they are sold. <b>Rava said to him:</b> That is not so, as <b>the Merciful One states: “And he shall be sold for his theft”</b> (Exodus 21:30), from which it is inferred: <b>For his theft, but not for his conspiring</b> testimony.",
            "§ It is taught in the <i>baraita</i>: The Sages <b>said in the name of Rabbi Akiva:</b> They also do not pay based on their own admission. The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Akiva?</b> He <b>holds</b> that money paid by a convicted conspiring witnesses <b>is a fine [<i>kenasa</i>], and</b> the principle is: <b>One does not pay a fine based on his own</b> admission; one pays a fine only on the basis of testimony. <b>Rabba says: Know</b> that it is a fine, <b>as</b> these witnesses <b>did not perform an action</b> and caused no actual damage, <b>and</b> yet <b>they are executed or pay</b> depending on the nature of their testimony, indicating that it is a fine rather than a monetary restitution. <b>Rav Naḥman says: Know</b> that it is a fine rather than a monetary restitution for damages, <b>as the money</b> they sought to compel him to pay ultimately remains <b>in the possession of the owner</b> against whom they testified, <b>and</b> yet <b>they pay</b> him."
        ],
        [
            "The Gemara is puzzled by this: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the statement: The money remains in the possession of the owner? It means <b>that they did not perform an action. That is</b> identical to the reasoning <b>of Rabba,</b> and it is not an additional explanation. The Gemara emends the formulation of the presentation of the statement. <b>Say: And likewise Rav Naḥman says:</b> Know that it is so, as the money remains in the possession of the owner. Rav Naḥman is not disagreeing with Rabba; he merely formulates the statement differently.",
            "§ Apropos the statement of Rabbi Akiva in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: A conspiring witness pays according to his share.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>Pays according to his share? If we say</b> that it means <b>that this</b> witness <b>pays half</b> of the sum that the set conspired to render another liable to pay with their testimony, <b>and that</b> witness <b>pays</b> the other <b>half, we</b> already <b>learned</b> this in a mishna (5a): When punishing conspiring witnesses, <b>one divides</b> the punishment of <b>money</b> among them, <b>but one does not divide</b> the punishment of <b>lashes</b> among them; each receives the full thirty-nine lashes.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara explains that the expression: Pays according to his share, means that in a case <b>where</b> only <b>one of</b> the set <b>was rendered a conspiring</b> witness, the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that he pays his half</b> of the sum. The Gemara asks: <b>And does</b> he <b>pay</b> at all in that case? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A conspiring witness pays money only when both were rendered conspiring</b> witnesses? If only one was rendered a conspiring witness, he does not pay.",
            "<b>Rava says:</b> The statement is not referring to a case of conspiring witnesses; rather, Rav’s statement applies <b>to</b> the case of one who <b>says:</b> It was <b>false testimony</b> that <b>I testified.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is it in his</b> power to have this statement accepted by the court? That runs counter to the principle: <b>Once</b> a witness <b>stated</b> his testimony <b>he may not then state</b> a revision of that testimony.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> Rav’s statement applies <b>to</b> the case of one who <b>says: We testified and were rendered conspiring</b> witnesses <b>in such and such a court.</b> Since he was already convicted as a conspiring witness, it is as though he is admitting an obligation to give monetary restitution, and he is therefore liable to pay his share. The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this <i>halakha</i>? It is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, since if</b> it were <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, doesn’t he say:</b> A conspiring witness <b>also does not pay based on his own</b> admission?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> Rav’s statement applies <b>to</b> the case of one who <b>says: We testified and were rendered conspiring</b> witnesses <b>in such and such a court and we were rendered liable</b> to pay a specific sum of <b>money.</b> In that scenario, Rabbi Akiva would concede that one pays on the basis of his own admission. Once the court rendered him liable to pay a specific sum, his admission is not that he is liable to pay a fine, in which case he would be exempt. Once the court actually instructed them to pay, the debt has the status of any other monetary restitution, and one does pay monetary restitution based on his own admission.",
            "The Gemara explains the novel element in Rav’s statement: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since he is unable to render his fellow</b> witness <b>liable</b> to pay based on his admission, as only the testimony of two witnesses is capable of doing so, <b>he too is not liable</b> to pay based on that admission. To counter this, Rav <b>teaches us</b> that his admission that he owes money renders him liable him to pay.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of witnesses who said: <b>We testify</b> with regard to <b>a man</b> called <b>so-and-so that he divorced his wife and did not give her</b> payment of <b>her marriage contract,</b> and they were then rendered conspiring witnesses, the question arises with regard to the manner in which the sum of their payment is calculated. It is not possible to render the witnesses liable to pay the entire sum of the marriage contract, as they can claim: <b>But isn’t</b> it so that <b>either today or tomorrow,</b> i.e., at some point in the future, he may divorce his wife or die and <b>ultimately he</b> will be liable <b>to give her</b> payment of <b>her marriage contract?</b> That being the case, the witnesses did not conspire to render him liable to pay a sum that he would otherwise not be liable to pay.",
            "The sum of their payment is calculated as follows: The court <b>assesses how much</b> money another <b>person</b> would be <b>willing to give in</b> order to purchase the rights to <b>this</b> woman’s <b>marriage contract,</b> cognizant of the uncertainty <b>that if she was widowed or divorced</b> the purchaser will receive payment of the marriage contract <b>but if she dies, her husband will inherit</b> from <b>her,</b> and the one who purchased her marriage contract will receive nothing.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna establishes that the payment of the conspiring witnesses is calculated based on the sum that one would be willing to pay for rights to payment of the marriage contract, taking into consideration the uncertainty whether he will ultimately receive that payment. The Gemara asks: <b>How does</b> the court <b>assess</b> that sum? <b>Rav Ḥisda says:</b> One calculates the sum <b>in</b> terms of <b>the husband:</b> How much would one be willing to pay for the husband’s rights to the marriage contract based on the likelihood that his wife will die first and he will inherit from her?",
            "<b>Rav Natan bar Oshaya says:</b> One calculates the sum <b>in</b> terms of <b>the wife:</b> How much would one be willing to pay for the wife’s rights to the marriage contract based on the likelihood that the husband will die first or divorce her?",
            "<b>Rav Pappa says:</b> One calculates the sum <b>in</b> terms of <b>the wife,</b> as Rav Natan bar Oshaya said, <b>and</b> the assessment is done <b>in</b> terms of the sum of <b>her marriage contract.</b> One does not include in the calculation any usufruct property that the wife brought with her into the marriage, the profits of which belong to the husband, despite the fact that as a result of the testimony of the conspiring witnesses the husband would lose his rights to those profits. One calculates the sum only in terms of her marriage contract.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of witnesses who said: <b>We testify with regard to a man</b> called <b>so-and-so that he owes another</b> person <b>one thousand dinars</b> that he borrowed <b>on the condition</b> that he is <b>to give</b> the money back <b>to him from now until thirty days</b> have passed, <b>and</b> the borrower <b>says</b> that he borrowed that sum but it was on the condition that he is to give the money back to him <b>from now until ten years</b> have passed, and they were rendered conspiring witnesses, here too, it is not possible to render the witnesses liable to pay the entire sum.",
            "Rather, the court <b>estimates how much</b> money <b>a person</b> would be <b>willing to give</b> so that he <b>would</b> keep a loan of <b>one thousand dinars in his possession,</b> and one calculates the difference <b>between</b> that sum in a situation where he would be required to <b>give</b> the money back <b>from now until thirty days</b> have passed, <b>and</b> that same sum in a situation where he would be required to <b>give</b> the money back <b>from now until ten years</b> have passed. That difference is the sum that the testimony of the conspiring witnesses sought to have the borrower lose; therefore, it is the sum that they must pay.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> In the case of <b>one who lends</b> money to <b>another for</b> a period of <b>ten years, the Sabbatical</b> Year <b>abrogates</b> the debt (see Deuteronomy 15:1–11) and absolves the borrower of the obligation to repay it."

            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> When punishing conspiring witnesses based on the verse: “As he conspired to do to his brother” (Deuteronomy 19:19), <b>one divides</b> the punishment <b>of money</b> among them, <b>but one does not divide</b> the punishment <b>of lashes</b> among them; each receives thirty-nine lashes.

Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him:</b> In the scenario you described, <b>you already touched upon</b> the case in the <i>baraita</i> cited above, the case of unintentional murder that is performed with <b>a downward</b> motion <b>that is for the purpose of an upward</b> motion. The ruling in the <i>baraita</i> is that one is liable to be exiled in that case.",
            "Rabbi Abbahu <b>raised an objection to</b> the explanation of Rabbi Yoḥanan from the mishna, which states: <b>This is the principle: Any</b> murderer <b>who</b> kills unintentionally <b>through his downward</b> motion <b>is exiled, and</b> one <b>who</b> kills <b>not through his downward</b> motion <b>is not exiled.</b> Rabbi Abbahu clarifies: With regard to the phrase in the mishna: One <b>who</b> kills <b>not through his downward</b> motion, <b>what</b> case that was not already specified does this serve <b>to add? Is it not to add a case like this,</b> and to teach that even though the death was caused by the falling rung, since the assailant was ascending the ladder at the time, he is not exiled? Rabbi Yoḥanan replied: <b>And according to your reasoning</b> that this apparently extraneous phrase serves to include a case that is not addressed explicitly, with regard to the previous phrase in the mishna: <b>Any</b> murderer <b>who</b> kills unintentionally <b>through his downward</b> motion, what case that was not already specified does this serve <b>to add?</b>",
            "<b>Rather,</b> one may say that it serves <b>to add</b> the case of <b>a butcher. Here too,</b> in the latter clause, the phrase: One who kills not through his downward motion, serves <b>to add</b> the case of <b>a butcher, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a butcher who was chopping</b> animal limbs with a cleaver, <b>one</b> Sage <b>taught</b> that if he killed a person <b>in front of him,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to be exiled; if he killed a person <b>behind him,</b> he is <b>exempt. And it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: If he killed a person <b>behind him,</b> he is <b>liable;</b> if he killed a person <b>in front of him,</b> he is <b>exempt.

            "When a butcher is about to cut the meat of an animal, he raises the cleaver and lowers it behind him in order to create momentum that will generate power. Then he raises the cleaver from behind him and brings it down forcefully onto the meat. In that process, the butcher lowers the cleaver in front of him and behind him and raises the cleaver both in front of him and behind him. Each of the four <i>baraitot</i> addresses a different stage of the process. <b>Here,</b> the <i>baraita</i> that says he is liable if he unintentionally murders a person in front of him and exempt if he unintentionally murders a person behind him, is referring to a case where the butcher swings the cleaver <b>with a downward</b> motion <b>in front of him and an upward</b> motion <b>behind him. There,</b> the <i>baraita</i> that says he is exempt if he unintentionally murders a person in front of him and liable if he unintentionally murders a person behind him, is referring to a case where the butcher swings the cleaver <b>with an upward</b> motion <b>in front of him and a downward</b> motion <b>behind him.</b>",
            "In addition, <b>here,</b> the <i>baraita</i> where he is liable in both instances, is referring to a case where the butcher swings the cleaver <b>with a downward</b> motion both <b>in front of him and behind him. There,</b> the <i>baraita</i> where he is exempt in both instances, is referring to a case where the butcher swings the cleaver <b>with an upward</b> motion both <b>in front of him and behind him.</b> The two phrases that constitute the principle in the mishna teach that the determining factor is whether the motion is upward or downward, not whether it is in front of him or behind him. This is Rabbi Yoḥanan’s reply to the objection of Rabbi Abbahu.",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that Rabbi Abbahu’s dilemma with regard to unintentional murder committed by one climbing a ladder is <b>the subject of</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>:</b> If <b>one was ascending a ladder and its rung was displaced from beneath him, it is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i> that he is <b>liable, and it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that he is <b>exempt.

            "The Gemara rejects that parallel: <b>No,</b> that is not the point of contention, <b>as everyone agrees</b> that <b>it is an upward</b> motion, <b>and</b> there is no dispute between the Sages in the <i>baraitot</i>. Nevertheless, the apparent contradiction between them is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that rules him liable, the reference is <b>to</b> payment of <b>damages,</b> as with regard to one’s liability to pay damages, there is no difference between upward and downward motions, or between intentional and unwitting damage; and <b>there,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that rules him exempt, the reference is <b>to exile,</b> from which one who murders unintentionally in an upward motion is exempt by Torah edict.",

The Gemara rejects that contention: One is not flogged in that case because lashes are administered only for violation of prohibitions <b>similar to the prohibition of muzzling</b> an ox while it is threshing grain (see Deuteronomy 25:4). The Torah juxtaposed that prohibition to the <i>halakhot</i> of lashes in the same passage, from which it is derived that lashes are administered only for violations similar to muzzling, i.e., a prohibition that does not entail fulfillment of a positive mitzva.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>Now that you have arrived at this</b> understanding, <b>all</b> the previous objections can <b>also</b> be resolved in the same manner: No lashes are administered for failure to fulfill a positive mitzva or for violation of a prohibition that does not entail an action, because one is flogged for violation only of prohibitions <b>similar to the prohibition of muzzling,</b> which is a prohibition and involves an action.",

            "<b>And</b> according to <b>the other</b> opinion of the Rabbis, since nothing relevant to the topic of intercourse with one’s sister is derived from the term “sister,” <b>that</b> term <b>is necessary</b> in order to derive an unrelated matter, i.e., <b>to divide</b> the various prohibitions and establish liability <b>for</b> either <b>one who blends</b> anointing oil <b>or for one who applies</b> anointing oil to receive <b><i>karet</i>,</b> if he performed either intentionally, and to bring a sin-offering if he performed either unwittingly, even though only a single punishment of <i>karet</i> is written in the verse: “A man who blends a mixture like it and who places any of it upon a non-priest, and he shall be excised from his people” (Exodus 30:33).",

Intercourse with a menstruating woman is already included in the verse: “For anyone who performs any of these abominations, the souls who do so shall be excised from among their people” (Leviticus 18:29). Since this verse does not introduce any nuance concerning the punishment of <i>karet</i> for one who engages in intercourse with a menstruating woman, an unrelated matter is derived, which establishes liability for one who blends anointing oil and for one who applies anointing oil to receive <i>karet</i> if he performed either act intentionally, and to bring a sin-offering if he performed either act unwittingly.",

If he nullifies the mitzva, e.g., if he vows that deriving benefit from his ex-wife is forbidden to him, thereby ensuring that he cannot remarry her, he is flogged. Reish Lakish holds that if one’s liability to receive lashes was dependent upon the nullification of the mitzva, the rapist would never be flogged, as in that case the forewarning would of necessity be uncertain. Therefore, he explains that the criterion for determining whether one is flogged is whether he fulfilled the mitzva immediately. Violating the prohibition renders him liable to receive lashes; he may then choose to be flogged or to fulfill the mitzva.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t there</b> the case of <b><i>pe’a</i>,</b> where there is a prohibition, <b>as the Merciful One states: “You shall not wholly reap the corner of</b> your field” (Leviticus 23:22), followed by the mitzva: <b>“To the poor and the convert you shall leave them”</b> (Leviticus 23:22)?",
            "And <b>you find</b> one liable to receive lashes <b>in</b> those cases both if the criterion is whether <b>he fulfilled</b> the mitzva <b>or did not fulfill</b> the mitzva, <b>and</b> if the criterion is whether <b>he nullified</b> the mitzva <b>or he did not nullify it, as we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b>mitzva of <i>pe’a</i></b> is <b>to separate</b> it <b>from the standing grain</b> still growing from the ground.

            "Apparently, it is possible to nullify the possibility of fulfilling the mitzva of leaving <i>pe’a</i> by grinding the grain; why, then, did Rabbi Yoḥanan omit this case from his list of prohibitions rectified by a positive mitzva for which one is flogged?

And</b> ostensibly, <b>it</b> could be derived by means of <b>a logical inference</b> that one may not do so: <b>A firstborn</b> offering <b>requires bringing</b> it <b>to</b> the <b>place,</b> to Jerusalem, and eating it there, <b>and</b> second<b>-tithe</b> produce <b>requires bringing</b> it <b>to</b> the <b>place; just as</b> the <b>firstborn</b> offering may be eaten there <b>only in the presence of the Temple, so too,</b> second<b>-tithe</b> produce may be eaten there <b>only in the presence of the Temple.</b>",
            "Rabbi Yishmael continues and counters: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about a firstborn?</b> Bringing the firstborn to Jerusalem is required only in the presence of the Temple, because it is notable in <b>that it requires placement of</b> its <b>blood and</b> its <b>sacrificial portions upon the altar;</b> will you say the same with regard to second-tithe produce, which requires only that it be consumed in Jerusalem? He then suggests: <b>First fruits will prove</b> that placement of blood upon the altar is not a factor, as they do not require placement of blood upon the altar, and yet they are brought to Jerusalem only in the presence of the Temple. Rabbi Yishmael counters: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about first fruits?</b> They are notable <b>in that they require placement</b> alongside the altar. Perhaps, since second-tithe produce does not require placement at all, even in the present one must bring it to Jerusalem and eat it there.",
            "Rabbi Yishmael concludes: Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And you shall eat before the Lord your God…</b>the tithe of your grain…and the firstborn of your herd and your flock” (Deuteronomy 14:23); the Torah <b>juxtaposes</b> second-<b>tithe</b> produce <b>to</b> the <b>firstborn. Just as</b> the <b>firstborn</b> may be eaten there <b>only in the presence of the Temple, so too,</b> second<b>-tithe</b> produce may be eaten there <b>only in the presence of the Temple.</b> The Gemara explains: the proof of Rav Sheshet’s opinion from the <i>baraita</i> is: <b>And if it is so</b> that the lack of recitation of the Torah verses invalidates the ritual of first fruits, <b>let</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>refute</b> the derivation by saying: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about first fruits?</b> They are notable <b>in that they require recitation</b> of the Torah verses <b>and placement</b> alongside the altar.",
            "<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> There is no proof from the fact that recitation is not mentioned. <b>Although</b> the lack of recitation <b>does not invalidate</b> the first fruits, <b>is there no mitzva?</b> Everyone agrees that there is a mitzva to recite the Torah verses. <b>And</b> therefore <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>say</b> that there is <b>a mitzva</b> to recite the portion; <b>and refute</b> the proof from first fruits in that manner, as in the case of second tithe there is no mitzva to recite Torah verses. <b>Rather, Rav Ashi said</b> that there is a different reason that recitation was omitted from the refutation: It is <b>that there is</b> the case of <b>the first fruits of a convert, who needs to recite:</b> “I have come to the land <b>that the Lord swore unto our fathers”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:3), <b>and</b> since <b>he cannot say</b> it, as the Lord did not swear to give the land to the ancestors of the convert, he brings the first fruits but does not read the portion. Therefore, the obligation to recite the Torah verses <b>is not clear-cut for</b> the <i>tanna</i> and he did not mention it.",
            "The Gemara asks: Why was it necessary for the <i>tanna</i> to derive that second-tithe produce is not brought to Jerusalem at present from the juxtaposition in the verse? <b>And let the derivation revert</b> to its starting point, <b>and derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>through</b> an analogy derived from <b>the common factor</b> of first fruits and the firstborn. Each of the sources neutralizes the significance of the notable factor in the other, leaving the common factor: One must bring them to Jerusalem. From there it may be derived that second-tithe produce, which one must also bring to Jerusalem, need not be brought there when the Temple is not standing. The Gemara answers: The juxtaposition is necessary <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> this analogy <b>can be refuted: What</b> is notable <b>about the common factor</b> that is true <b>of</b> both first fruits and the firstborn? It is notable <b>in that they have an aspect</b> involving the <b>altar,</b> which is not so in the case of second tithe.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And what</b> opinion <b>does</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>hold</b> that led to his initial assumption that one is obligated to bring a firstborn animal to Jerusalem only when the Temple is standing? <b>If</b> he <b>maintains</b> in general that <b>the initial consecration</b> of the Temple <b>sanctified</b> Jerusalem <b>for its time and sanctified</b> Jerusalem <b>forever,</b> and the location of the Temple remains sacred even after the Temple was destroyed, then one should <b>also</b> be obligated to bring <b>a firstborn</b> animal to the place of the Temple and sacrifice it on an altar and eat it. <b>If he maintains</b> that <b>the initial consecration</b> of the Temple <b>sanctified</b> Jerusalem <b>for its time but did not sanctify</b> Jerusalem <b>forever,</b> then he should <b>raise a dilemma even</b> with regard to <b>a firstborn,</b> whether it may be eaten in Jerusalem.",
            "<b>Ravina said: Actually,</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>maintains</b> that the initial consecration of the Temple <b>sanctified</b> Jerusalem <b>for its time but did not sanctify</b> Jerusalem <b>forever; and</b> why is it obvious to him that the firstborn is not eaten?

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And does a matter derived via juxtaposition then teach</b> another matter <b>via juxtaposition?</b> The principle with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of consecrated matters is that a <i>halakha</i> derived via one of the hermeneutical principles cannot serve as the basis for derivation of another <i>halakha</i>; each <i>halakha</i> requires its own source. The Gemara answers: Second <b>tithe of grain is non-sacred</b> produce, and <i>halakhot</i> of non-sacred matters derived via hermeneutical principles may serve as the basis for deriving other <i>halakhot</i> using hermeneutical principles."

            "The Gemara answers: This is not a matter derived from a matter derived from a juxtaposition, as the status of the firstborn offering is not derived from the status of blood; <b>blood and flesh are one matter.</b> There is only one derivation in this case, which is that the status of second-tithe produce is derived from the status of the blood and the flesh of the firstborn.",

            "The Gemara answers: It is derived <b>as it is written</b> with regard to second-tithe produce: <b>“You may not eat within your gates</b> the tithe of your grain or of your wine or of your oil” (Deuteronomy 12:17), <b>and later,</b> with regard to a blemished firstborn animal, the verse <b>states: “Within your gates you may eat it, the impure and the pure</b> may eat it alike” (Deuteronomy 15:22).",

            "The Gemara stated that the case of second-tithe produce that was not redeemed, cited in the previous mishna, is referring to second-tithe produce that is impure.

Therefore, the phrase: You are unable <i>se’eto</i>, means: You cannot eat it, referring to a case where it is impure.

            "The Gemara infers from the statement in the <i>baraita</i>: And it is a year when second tithe is separated and he is in Jerusalem, that <b>the reason</b> he is flogged with two sets of lashes <b>is that he is</b> currently <b>in Jerusalem,</b> where it is permitted to partake of second-tithe produce. <b>But</b> if he ate the fig <b>in the outlying areas,</b> outside of Jerusalem, and he designated second tithe in the fig, <b>he is flogged</b> with <b>three</b> sets of lashes.

            "<b>Reading the Scroll</b> of Esther is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written: “The Jews confirmed, and they took upon themselves”</b> (Esther 9:27).

This indicates that the heavenly court agreed that the first tithe should be brought to the Temple treasury. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>“<i>ad beli dai</i>”? Rami bar Rav says:</b> It means that the abundance will be so great <b>that your lips will be worn out [<i>yivlu</i>], from saying enough [<i>dai</i>].</b>",
            "The Gemara cites a somewhat similar statement. <b>Rabbi Elazar says: In three places the Divine Spirit appeared</b> before all to affirm that the action taken was appropriate: <b>In the court of Shem, in the court of Samuel the Ramathite, and in the court of Solomon.</b> The Gemara elaborates: This occurred <b>in the court of Shem, as it is written</b> in the context of the episode of Judah and Tamar: <b>“And Judah acknowledged them and said: She is more righteous than I [<i>mimmenni</i>]”</b> (Genesis 38:26). <b>How did</b> Judah <b>know</b> that Tamar’s assertion that she was bearing his child was correct? <b>Perhaps, just as he went to her</b> and hired her as a prostitute, <b>another person went to her</b> and hired her <b>as well,</b> and he is not the father.

            "Likewise, this occurred <b>in the court of Samuel, as it is written: “Here I am; testify against me before the Lord and before His anointed: Whose ox have I taken…And they said: You have neither defrauded us nor oppressed us…And he said to them: The Lord is witness against you, and His anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand. And he said: He is witness”</b> (I Samuel 12:3–5). Based on the context, instead of the singular: <b>“And he said,”</b> the plural: <b>And they said, should have</b> been written, as the verse appears to be the reply of the Jewish people to Samuel’s challenge, attesting to the truth of his statement. Rather, <b>a Divine Voice emerged and said: I,</b> God, <b>am witness to this matter.</b>",
            "This occurred <b>in the court of Solomon,</b> when the Divine Spirit appeared in the dispute between two prostitutes over who was the mother of the surviving child, <b>as it is written: “And the king answered and said: Give her the living child, and do not slay him; she is his mother”</b> (I Kings 3:27). <b>How did</b> Solomon <b>know</b> that she was the mother? <b>Perhaps she was devious</b> and was not the mother of the surviving child at all. Rather, <b>a Divine Voice emerged and said: She is his mother.</b>",
            "<b>Rava said: From where</b> do you draw these conclusions? None of these proofs is absolute. <b>Perhaps</b> in the case of <b>Judah, once he calculated</b> the passage of the <b>months and the days</b> from when he engaged in intercourse with Tamar <b>and it happened</b> to correspond with the duration of her pregnancy, he realized that her assertion is correct. There is no room to suspect that another man was the father, as the principle is: Based on that <b>which we see, we establish presumptive status;</b> based on that <b>which we do not see, we do not establish presumptive status.</b>",

            "With regard to <b>Solomon too,</b> perhaps he reasoned that <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that this</b> woman <b>is merciful</b> and seeks to spare the baby <b>and this</b> woman <b>is not merciful,</b> it is evident that the former is its mother. <b>Rather,</b> Rava concludes: There is no proof from the verses that a Divine Spirit appeared in those circumstances; rather, there is <b>a tradition</b> that this is the case.",

            "Rabbi Akiva <b>said to them: That is why I am laughing, as it is written,</b> when God revealed the future to the prophet Isaiah: <b>“And I will take to Me faithful witnesses to attest: Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah”</b> (Isaiah 8:2). <b>Now what is the connection between Uriah and Zechariah?</b> He clarifies the difficulty: <b>Uriah</b> prophesied <b>during the First Temple</b> period, <b>and Zechariah</b> prophesied <b>during the Second Temple</b> period, as he was among those who returned to Zion from Babylonia. <b>Rather, the verse established that</b> fulfillment of <b>the prophecy of Zechariah</b> is <b>dependent on</b> fulfillment of <b>the prophecy of Uriah.</b>",
            "<b>In</b> the prophecy of <b>Uriah it is written: “Therefore, for your sake Zion shall be plowed as a field,</b> and Jerusalem shall become rubble, and the Temple Mount as the high places of a forest” (Micah 3:12), where foxes are found. There is a rabbinic tradition that this was prophesied by Uriah. <b>In</b> the prophecy of <b>Zechariah it is written: “There shall yet be elderly men and elderly women sitting in the streets of Jerusalem”</b> (Zechariah 8:4). <b>Until the prophecy of Uriah</b> with regard to the destruction of the city <b>was fulfilled I was afraid that the prophecy of Zechariah would not be fulfilled,</b> as the two prophecies are linked. <b>Now that the prophecy of Uriah was fulfilled, it</b> is <b>evident that the prophecy of Zechariah</b> remains <b>valid.</b> The Gemara adds: The Sages <b>said to him,</b> employing <b>this formulation: Akiva, you have comforted us; Akiva, you have comforted us.</b>"
