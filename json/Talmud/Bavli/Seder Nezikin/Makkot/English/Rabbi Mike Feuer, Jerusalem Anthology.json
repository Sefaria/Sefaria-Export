            "And R’ Yehoshua ben Levi said:  what does the verse “A song of ascents of David. I rejoiced when they said to me, \"Let us go to the house of the Lord\" (Psalms 122:1) mean?  David said before the Holy One:  Master of the World! I heard people saying –  when will this old man die so that his son Shlomo may come and build the Chosen House and we can ascend there on the festivals, and I rejoiced.  The Holy One replied to him:  “For a day in Your courts is better than a thousand…” (Psalms 84:11) As single day that you are occupied with Torah is preferable to Me than a thousand sacrifices which in the future Shlomo will offer on the altar before me."

            "Once R’ Gamliel, R’ Elazar ben Azaryah, R’ Yehoshua and R’ Akiva were walking on the way and they heard the noise of the multitudes of Rome from Pleita, a hundred and twenty miles away. They began to weep, and R’ Akiva laughed.  They said to him:  why are you laughing?  He said to them:  and you, why are you weeping?  They said to him:  these heathen who bow to idols and offer incense to the stars are sitting quiet and secure, while us - the House which is the footstool of our Gd is burnt "

            " with fire, shouldn’t we weep?!  He said to them:  this is exactly why I am laughing. If this is how He treats those that transgress His will, how much more He will do for those who do His will. ", 
            "Another time they were going up to Jerusalem, and once they reached Mount Scopus they tore their clothes.  When they reached the Temple Mount they saw a fox come out of the place of the Holy of Holies - they began to weep and R’ Akiva began to laugh.  They said to him:  why are you laughing?  He said to them:  and you, why are you weeping?  They said to him:  the place of which it is said “any outsider who approaches shall be put to death” (Bamidbar 1:51) has become the haunt of foxes, shouldn’t we weep?! ", 
            "He said to them:  this is exactly why I laugh. It is written “And I will call to testify for Myself trustworthy witnesses, Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.” (Isaiah 8:2)  What is Uriah doing together with Zechariah?  Uriah was during the First Temple and Zechariah during the Second Temple! Rather, the Scripture linked the prophecy of Zechariah to the prophecy of Uriah. ", 
            "In (the prophecy from the days of) Uriah it says “Therefore, because of you, Zion shall be plowed as a field…” (Micah 3:12) and in Zechariah it says “Old men and old women shall once again sit in the broad places of Jerusalem…” (Zechariah 8:4)  So long as Uriah’s prophecy was not fulfilled – I was afraid that Zechariah’s prophecy would not be fulfilled. Now that Uriah’s prophecy was fulfilled – it is certain that Zechariah’s will be fulfilled.  They said to him: Akiva you have comforted us! Akiva you have comforted us!"
