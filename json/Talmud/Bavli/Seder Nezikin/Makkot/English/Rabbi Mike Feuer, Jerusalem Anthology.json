David said before the Holy One:  Master of the World! I heard people saying –  when will this old man die so that his son Shlomo may come and build the Chosen House and we can ascend there on the festivals, and I rejoiced.  The Holy One replied to him:  “For a day in Your courts is better than a thousand…” (Psalms 84:11) As single day that you are occupied with Torah is preferable to Me than a thousand sacrifices which in the future Shlomo will offer on the altar before me."

They began to weep, and R’ Akiva laughed.  They said to him:  why are you laughing?  He said to them:  and you, why are you weeping?  They said to him:  these heathen who bow to idols and offer incense to the stars are sitting quiet and secure, while us - the House which is the footstool of our Gd is burnt "

            "Another time they were going up to Jerusalem, and once they reached Mount Scopus they tore their clothes.  When they reached the Temple Mount they saw a fox come out of the place of the Holy of Holies - they began to weep and R’ Akiva began to laugh.  They said to him:  why are you laughing?  He said to them:  and you, why are you weeping?  They said to him:  the place of which it is said “any outsider who approaches shall be put to death” (Bamidbar 1:51) has become the haunt of foxes, shouldn’t we weep?! ",
            "He said to them:  this is exactly why I laugh. It is written “And I will call to testify for Myself trustworthy witnesses, Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.” (Isaiah 8:2)  What is Uriah doing together with Zechariah?  Uriah was during the First Temple and Zechariah during the Second Temple! Rather, the Scripture linked the prophecy of Zechariah to the prophecy of Uriah. ",
            "In (the prophecy from the days of) Uriah it says “Therefore, because of you, Zion shall be plowed as a field…” (Micah 3:12) and in Zechariah it says “Old men and old women shall once again sit in the broad places of Jerusalem…” (Zechariah 8:4)  So long as Uriah’s prophecy was not fulfilled – I was afraid that Zechariah’s prophecy would not be fulfilled. Now that Uriah’s prophecy was fulfilled – it is certain that Zechariah’s will be fulfilled.  They said to him: Akiva you have comforted us! Akiva you have comforted us!"
