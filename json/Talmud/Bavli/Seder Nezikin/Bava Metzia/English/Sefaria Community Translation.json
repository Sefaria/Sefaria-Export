No, it's necessary. He accepted from both of them. One willingly and one forced. And we don't know which one is which. (Our text follows Rashi. According to Tos., the correct version is, \"he doesn't know.\" The circumstances ,i.e., he accepted money from both of them is just an explanation why he doesn't remember.

In any case where who would load and unload his own property, he must also load and unload that which belongs to someone else.” R. Ishmael, son of R. Yossi, was walking on the road when he came upon a man who was carrying bundles of sticks. The man put them down, and rested. Then he said to R. Ishmael, “Help me pick them up.” He asked him, “How much are they worth?” He said to him, “Half a zuz.”  So R. Ishamel gave him half a zuz, and declared the bundle of sticks ownerless.  But the man took them back for himself. So R. Ishmael again paid him half a zuz, and declared the sticks ownerless. Seeing that the man intended to acquire them for himself again, he said to him: “With respect to the rest of the world, these sticks are ownerless [and anyone can take them]. But with respect to you, they are not ownerless [and you cannot reacquire them].” But if that is the case, who would say it was really ownerless? As it has been taught according to the House of Shammai, items declared ownerless can only be acquired by the poor. According to the House of Hillel, an item only qualifies as ownerless if it can be acquired by rich and poor alike, as in [the case of the rules pertaining to] the sabbatical year. So R. Ishmael the son of R. Yossi did, in fact, declare it ownerless and available to anyone to take! It was by words alone that he stopped him.  But R. Ishmael was an elder, and it was not in accordance with his dignity [to help the man]. R. Ishmael, son of R. Yossi, acted within the line of the law. R. Yosef taught [expounding Ex. 18:20], “You shall make known to them” - this refers to their livelihood; “The path” - this refers to acts of loving-kindness; “They are to walk” - this refers to visiting the sick; “Upon” - this refers to burial; “The deeds” - this refers to the law; “They are to perform” - this refers to [actions] within the line of the law.",

The master reasoned that one who visits a sick person with whom shares a particular affinity takes one-sixtieth of his illness upon himself, but he must visit him nevertheless.  “Upon it” – this refers to burial. We still would not need to mention [a prooftext for] deeds of loving-kindness, except for the case of an elder, where the task is not in accordance with his dignity. “They are to perform” – this refers to [actions] within the line of the law. R. Yohanan taught, “Jerusalem was destroyed because its inhabitants judged according to the law of Torah.” Should they instead have made arbitrary judgments?! Rather, [the teaching means that] they based their judgments on a strict interpretation of Torah law, instead of acting within the line of the law."
