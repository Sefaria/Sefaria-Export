            "The early commentaries ask why this chapter, which discusses details of the <i>halakhot</i> of found items, precedes the second chapter, which discusses the fundamental <i>halakhot</i> of found items.<br><i>Tosafot</i> explain that as tractate <i>Bava Metzia</i> follows tractate <i>Bava Kamma</i>, the <i>halakhot</i> of found items are elucidated in this chapter as a continuation of the topics discussed in the last chapter of <i>Bava Kamma</i>, which discussed the division of items between litigants by means of an oath, which is also the ruling in the mishna here (see <i>Shita Mekubbetzet</i>). The Rosh explains that because there is a suspicion of theft in this case, these matters are juxtaposed with the <i>halakhot</i> of theft, which are described at length in <i>Bava Kamma</i>.<br><br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>two</b> people came to court <b>holding a garment,</b> and <b>this</b> one, the first litigant, <b>says: I found it, and that</b> one, the second litigant, <b>says: I found it; this</b> one <b>says: All of it is mine, and that</b> one <b>says: All of it is mine;</b> how does the court adjudicate this case? <b>This</b> one <b>takes an oath that he does not have</b> ownership of <b>less than half of it, and that</b> one <b>takes an oath that he does not have</b> ownership of <b>less than half of it, and they divide</b> it.",
            "If <b>this</b> one <b>says: All of it is mine, and that</b> one <b>says: Half of it is mine,</b> since they both agree that half of the cloak belongs to one of them, the conflict between them is only about the other half. Therefore, <b>the one who says: All of it is mine, takes an oath that he does not have</b> ownership of <b>less than three parts,</b> i.e., three-fourths, <b>of it, and the one who says: Half of it is mine, takes an oath that he does not have</b> ownership of <b>less than one-quarter of it. This</b> one <b>takes three parts, and that</b> one <b>takes one-quarter.</b>",
            "If <b>two</b> people <b>were sitting</b> in a riding position <b>on</b> the back of <b>an animal,</b> e.g., a donkey or camel, <b>or one was sitting</b> in a riding position on the animal <b>and one was leading</b> it by its halter, and <b>this</b> one <b>says: All of it is mine, and that</b> one <b>says: All of it is mine,</b> how does the court adjudicate this case? <b>This</b> one <b>takes an oath that he does not have</b> ownership of <b>less than half of it, and that</b> one <b>takes an oath that he does not have</b> ownership of <b>less than half of it, and they divide</b> it.",
            "<b>When they admit</b> to the validity of each other’s claims <b>or when they</b> each <b>have witnesses</b> attesting to their claims, <b>they divide</b> the disputed item <b>without</b> taking <b>an oath,</b> as an oath is administered only in a case where the parties have no other way to prove their claims.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the <i>tanna</i> <b>to teach</b> two separate claims made by each party? Why does the <i>tanna</i> say both: <b>This</b> one <b>says: I found it, and that</b> one <b>says: I found it;</b> and in addition: <b>This</b> one <b>says: All of it is mine, and that</b> one <b>says: All of it is mine? Let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach one</b> case. The Gemara answers: The correct understanding of the mishna is that <b>it teaches one</b> claim of each party, as their claims were as follows: <b>This</b> one <b>says: I found it and all of it is mine, and that</b> one <b>says: I found it and all of it is mine.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach</b> a case where each one merely claims: <b>I found it, and I would know that</b> the intention of each litigant is to claim: <b>All of it is mine.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>would teach</b> only that each one claimed: <b>I found it, I would say</b> that <b>what</b> is the meaning of the claim: I <b>found it?</b> It means: I <b>saw it.</b> In other words, he is claiming that he saw the item first, and he believes that <b>even though it did not reach his possession, he acquired</b> it <b>through mere sight.</b> Since it would have been possible to think that this is an effective claim, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> that the litigant states definitively: <b>All of it is mine,</b> to teach <b>that</b> one <b>does not acquire</b> a lost item <b>through sight</b> alone.",
            "The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>But how can you say</b> that <b>what</b> the term: I <b>found it,</b> means is actually: I <b>saw it? But didn’t Rabbenai say</b> in interpreting the verse: “And so shall you do with every lost item of your brother’s, which he has lost, and you have found it” (Deuteronomy 22:3), that <b>“and you have found it” indicates that it came into his possession?</b> The term find in the Torah refers exclusively to a situation where the item is in the possession of the finder.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Indeed,</b> the phrase <b>“and you have found it” in the verse</b> certainly <b>indicates that it came into his possession. But</b> one might say that the <b><i>tanna</i> employed colloquial language</b> in the mishna. And in colloquial language, <b>once</b> a person <b>sees</b> an item, <b>he says: I found it, even if it did not</b> yet <b>come into his possession,</b> because he believes that <b>he acquired</b> the item <b>through mere sight.</b> Since it would have been possible to understand the claim of: I found it, in this manner, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> that the litigant states definitively: <b>All of it is mine,</b> to teach <b>that</b> one <b>does not acquire</b> a lost item <b>through sight</b> alone.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if that was the objective of the <i>tanna</i>, <b>let him teach</b> that each party need only state: <b>All of it is mine, and</b> the litigant would <b>not need</b> to say: <b>I found it.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> the <i>tanna</i> had <b>taught</b> that it is sufficient for each party to claim only: <b>All of it is mine, I would say</b> that <b>in general, when</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> that one claims: I <b>found it,</b> he means that the finder <b>acquires</b> the item <b>through mere sight.</b> Therefore, he <b>taught</b> that the litigants claimed: I <b>found it, and</b> he <b>then taught</b> that the litigants claimed: <b>All of it is mine,</b> to teach that only when the litigants each make both of these claims does the court divide the item, <b>as</b> from <b>the superfluous</b> expression in the <b>mishna he teaches us that one does not acquire</b> the item through <b>sight</b> alone.",
            "After explaining the viability of this interpretation, the Gemara asks: <b>But how can you say</b> that the mishna <b>is teaching one</b> claim of each party? <b>But doesn’t</b> the mishna <b>teach: This</b> one says, <b>and</b> again: <b>This</b> one says? In other words, the mishna writes: <b>This</b> one <b>says: I found it, and that</b> one <b>says: I found it;</b> and it states additionally: <b>This</b> one <b>says: All of it is mine,</b> and that one says: All of it is mine. From the fact that the <i>tanna</i> introduced each of the claims with the phrase: This one says, it is apparent that they are two separate claims, not one compound claim.",
            "<b>Rav Pappa said, and some say</b> it was said by <b>Rav Shimi bar Ashi, and some say</b> it was <b>an unattributed [<i>kedi</i>]</b> statement: <b>The first clause,</b> where each party says: I found it, is referring <b>to</b> a case of <b>a found item,</b> where two people found one item. <b>And the latter clause,</b> where each party says: All of it is mine, is referring <b>to</b> a case of <b>buying and selling,</b> where each party claims that he is the one who bought the item from its seller.",
            "<b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for the mishna to teach its ruling both with regard to a found item and with regard to a purchase."
        ],
        [
            "<b>As had</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> the case of <b>a found item</b> alone, <b>I would say</b> that <b>it is</b> only in the case of <b>a found item that the Sages imposed an oath upon him, as</b> in that case <b>one can rationalize</b> his actions <b>and say: The other</b> party, the one who in fact found the item, <b>is not losing anything</b> by not keeping all of <b>it,</b> as it was not his to begin with. <b>I will go seize</b> it from him <b>and divide</b> it <b>with him. But</b> in the case of <b>buying and selling, where that cannot be said, say</b> that the Sages did <b>not</b> impose an oath upon him.",
            "<b>And had</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> the case of <b>buying and selling</b> alone, one might say that <b>it is</b> specifically in this case <b>that the Sages imposed an oath upon him, because he could rationalize</b> his actions, <b>saying</b> to himself: <b>The other</b> party <b>gave money</b> to the seller <b>and I gave money</b> to the seller; <b>now that I need</b> it <b>for myself, I will take it and let the other one go to the trouble to buy</b> another item like the first item. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>a found item, where that cannot be said, say</b> that the Sages did <b>not</b> suspect that he seized an item that did not belong to him, and therefore there is no need to impose an oath upon him. Therefore, both cases are <b>necessary.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: How can the mishna be referring to a case of <b>buying and selling? But let us see from whom</b> the seller <b>took the money.</b> Obviously, the one who gave him the money is the one who bought it. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where he took</b> money <b>from both of them.</b> He accepted the money <b>willingly from</b> the <b>one</b> to whom he wanted to sell the item, <b>and</b> he received the money <b>against his will from</b> the <b>one</b> to whom he did not want to sell the item, <b>and I do not know who is</b> the one from whom he took it <b>willingly, and who is</b> the one from whom he received it <b>against his will.</b> Consequently, the matter is clarified by means of an oath.",
            "§ The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>ben Nannas, as, if</b> it were in accordance with the opinion of <b>ben Nannas, doesn’t he say</b> that an oath is not administered to two parties in court when one of them is certainly lying?",
            "As it is stated in a mishna (<i>Shevuot</i> 45a): With regard to a case where a man said to his laborer: Go to the storekeeper and he will give you food in lieu of your salary, and sometime later the laborer claimed that the storekeeper did not give him anything while the storekeeper claimed that he did, the Rabbis say: The storekeeper and the laborer must each take an oath to support their claims, and the employer must pay them both. Ben Nannas says in response: <b>How</b> can you allow <b>these</b> people, i.e., the laborer, <b>and those</b> people, i.e., the storekeeper, to <b>come to</b> take <b>an oath in vain?</b> Since one of them is definitely lying, the Sages would not impose the taking of an oath that by definition must be false. Similarly, in the case of the mishna here, since the found item is divided between the parties in any case, according to the opinion of ben Nannas they should receive their portions without taking an oath.",
            "The Gemara rejects this suggestion: It is <b>even</b> possible for <b>you to say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>ben Nannas. There,</b> in the case of the laborer and the storekeeper, <b>an oath is certainly</b> taken in <b>vain,</b> as it is clear that one of them is lying. <b>Here, there is</b> room <b>to say that there is no oath</b> taken in <b>vain. Say that they</b> are <b>both</b> taking an oath truthfully, as they <b>lifted</b> the item <b>together,</b> and therefore each of them owns half of it. In this case, ben Nannas would agree that they both take an oath.",
            "The Gemara suggests further: <b>Let us say that the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Sumakhos, as, if</b> it were <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Sumakhos, doesn’t he say</b> the following principle: In a case of <b>property of uncertain ownership,</b> the parties <b>divide</b> it <b>without</b> taking <b>an oath.</b>",
            "The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>Rather, what</b> opinion does the mishna follow? Does the mishna follow the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Sumakhos? <b>Don’t they say</b> that in a case of property of uncertain ownership <b>the burden of proof rests upon the claimant?</b> In the case of the mishna neither side offers proof.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>What is this</b> comparison? <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> there is room to distinguish between two cases: <b>There,</b> in the case of property of uncertain ownership, <b>where both</b> parties <b>are not grasping</b> the property, <b>the Rabbis say</b> that <b>the burden of proof rests upon the claimant</b> since the one with possession of the property ostensibly has the right to that property. <b>Here,</b> in the case of the mishna, <b>where both are grasping</b> the property and neither has exclusive possession of the item, <b>they divide it with</b> the proviso that they take <b>an oath.</b>",
            "The Gemara continues to state its proof that the mishna is not in accordance with the opinion of Sumakhos: <b>But if you say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Sumakhos,</b> how do you resolve the following contradiction: <b>Now, if there,</b> in a case <b>where they are not both grasping</b> the property, <b>they</b> nevertheless <b>divide</b> it <b>without</b> taking <b>an oath, here, where they are both grasping</b> the property, is it <b>not all the more so</b> that they should divide it without taking an oath?",
            "The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Sumakhos. When Sumakhos states</b> that in a case of property of uncertain ownership, the parties divide it without taking an oath, that is in the case of <b>an uncertain</b> claim <b>and an uncertain</b> claim, i.e., when the circumstances are such that neither party can state definitively that he is entitled to the property. <b>But</b> in a case of <b>a certain</b> claim <b>and a certain</b> claim, where each party states definitively that he is entitled to the property, Sumakhos <b>does not say</b> that they divide the property without taking an oath.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna, who said</b> that <b>Sumakhos says</b> that <b>even</b> in a case of <b>a certain</b> claim <b>and a certain</b> claim the parties divide the property without an oath, <b>what is there to say</b> to establish the mishna in accordance with the opinion of Sumakhos?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>You may even say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Sumakhos. When Sumakhos says</b> that property of uncertain ownership is divided, he is referring to a case <b>where</b> the litigants <b>have a financial association</b> with the item independent of their claims to it. <b>But where</b> the litigants <b>do not have a financial association</b> with the item beyond their claims, they do not divide it without taking an oath.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But is it not an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference? <b>If there,</b> in a case <b>where</b> this <b>Master has a financial association</b> with the item, <b>and</b> that <b>Master has a financial association</b> with the item,"
        ],
        [
            "<b>and there is</b> room <b>to say</b> that <b>it</b> belongs <b>entirely to one</b> of them, <b>and there is</b> also room <b>to say</b> that <b>it</b> belongs <b>entirely to</b> the other <b>one,</b> and nevertheless <b>Sumakhos says</b> that since it is <b>property of uncertain ownership they divide</b> it <b>without</b> taking <b>an oath,</b> then <b>here, where</b> the litigants have <b>no financial association</b> with the item, <b>as there is</b> room <b>to say that it</b> belongs to <b>both of them, all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that they should divide it without taking an oath?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>You may even say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Sumakhos: This oath is</b> instituted <b>by rabbinic</b> law <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan. As Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This oath,</b> administered in the case of two people holding a garment, <b>is an ordinance</b> instituted <b>by the Sages so that everyone will not go and seize the garment of another and say: It is mine.</b>",
            "§ The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that the mishna</b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei. As, if</b> you say that the ruling is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, doesn’t he say</b> that a case cannot be decided in a manner in which there is no deterrent for one taking a false claim to court (37a)? He says this with regard to a case where two people deposited money with the same person. One deposited one hundred dinars and one deposited two hundred, and the bailee forgot which of them deposited the larger sum. Subsequently, each claimed ownership of the larger sum and was prepared to take an oath to that effect. The Rabbis say that each should receive the smaller sum and the remainder should be held until Elijah the prophet prophetically resolves the uncertainty. Rabbi Yosei says: <b>If so, what did</b> the <b>swindler lose? Rather, the entire</b> deposit <b>will be placed</b> in a safe place <b>until Elijah comes.</b>",
            "The Gemara counters: <b>Rather, what</b> is suggested? Is it suggested that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Yosei? <b>Since the Rabbis say</b> there: <b>The remainder is placed</b> in a safe place <b>until Elijah comes, this</b> case of the mishna concerning the garment <b>is also comparable to the remainder</b> in the case of the deposit, <b>as it is uncertain</b> to whom the entire garment belongs. It should therefore be placed in a safe place until the matter is resolved.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>What</b> is <b>this</b> comparison? <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis there,</b> in the case of the depositors, <b>where these one hundred dinars certainly belong to</b> only <b>one of them</b> and <b>the Rabbis say</b> that <b>it is placed</b> in a safe place <b>until Elijah comes, here,</b> in the case of this mishna, <b>where there is</b> room <b>to say that it belongs to both of them, the Rabbis say</b> that <b>they divide</b> it <b>with</b> the proviso that they take <b>an oath.</b>",
            "<b>But if you say</b> that the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> there is a difficulty. <b>Now</b> consider, <b>if there,</b> in a case <b>where it is certain that there are one hundred dinars</b> that belong <b>to one</b> of the litigants <b>and there are one hundred dinars</b> that belong <b>to</b> the other <b>one,</b> nevertheless, <b>Rabbi Yosei says</b> that the entire sum <b>is placed</b> in a safe place <b>until Elijah comes, here, where there is</b> room <b>to say that it</b> all <b>belongs to</b> only <b>one of them, all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that it should be placed in a safe place until Elijah comes, as one of the claims may be entirely fraudulent?",
            "The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>You may even say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei: There,</b> in the case of the deposit, <b>there is certainly a swindler</b> between the two depositors. By contrast, <b>here,</b> in the case of the mishna, <b>who is to say that there is a swindler? Say</b> that <b>both of them lifted</b> the garment <b>at the same time,</b> and therefore there is no reason to penalize them by placing the garment in a safe place.",
            "<b>Alternatively,</b> there is room to distinguish between the cases: <b>There, Rabbi Yosei penalizes</b> the <b>swindler</b> by confiscating his deposit <b>so that he will admit</b> that he lied in order to receive his original deposit of one hundred dinars from the bailee. <b>Here,</b> in the case of the garment, <b>what loss</b> would a swindler <b>incur that</b> would prompt him to <b>admit</b> that he is lying? If the item is placed in a safe place, he loses nothing.",
            "The Gemara rejects this alternative explanation: This distinction <b>works out well</b> in the case of <b>a found item</b> where he did not pay anything for it. Consequently, he has no incentive to admit that he lied. But in a case of <b>buying and selling, what is there to say?</b> Both parties paid for the item and prefer to receive the item. <b>Rather,</b> the distinction <b>is clearly as we explained initially.</b> The difference between the cases is that in the mishna, there is no certainty that one of them is lying.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Both according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis and according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, there, with regard to</b> the case of <b>a storekeeper</b> relying <b>on his ledger,</b> it is unclear why the money is not held until the matter is clarified. This is referring to a case where an employer tells a storekeeper to give food to his laborer in lieu of his salary, and later the storekeeper claims that he gave it to him but the laborer claims that he did not receive it. Both parties therefore claim payment from the employer. <b>As</b> the mishna (<i>Shevuot</i> 45a) <b>teaches</b> that <b>this</b> one, the storekeeper, <b>takes an oath</b> that he gave the food to the laborer <b>and receives</b> payment from the employer, <b>and that</b> one, the laborer, <b>takes an oath</b> that he was not given the food <b>and takes</b> his salary from the employer.",
            "<b>What is different</b> in that case, <b>that we do not say: Appropriate the money from the employer, and it is placed</b> in a safe place <b>until Elijah comes?</b> Apparently, we should say this <b>because there is certainly a swindler</b> among the litigants, since it is impossible that both the storekeeper and the laborer are telling the truth.",
            "The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>There, this is the reason</b> that the money is not set aside: <b>Because the storekeeper can say to the employer: I carried out your agency</b> to give the food to the laborer, and I have dealings only with you. <b>What</b> business <b>do I have with the hired laborer? Even if he takes an oath to me</b> that he did not receive the food, he is <b>not trustworthy to me by</b> virtue of his <b>oath. You</b> are the one who <b>trusted him, as you did not say to me: Give him</b> the food <b>in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses.</b> Therefore, you are obligated to pay me. If you have a grievance, settle it with your employee.",
            "<b>And</b> the <b>hired laborer can also say to the employer: I worked for you. What</b> relationship <b>do I have with the storekeeper? Even if he takes an oath to me</b> that he gave me the change, he is <b>not trustworthy to me</b> by virtue of his oath. <b>Therefore, both</b> parties <b>take an oath and take</b> payment <b>from the employer.</b>",
            "§ <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: If one says to another: <b>I</b> have <b>one hundred dinars [<i>maneh</i>] in your possession</b> that you borrowed from me and did not repay, <b>and the other</b> party <b>says: Nothing of yours</b> is <b>in my possession, and the witnesses testify that he has fifty dinars</b> that he owes the claimant, <b>he gives him fifty dinars and takes an oath about the remainder,</b> i.e., that he did not borrow the fifty remaining dinars from him.",
            "This ruling is derived <b>via an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference from the <i>halakha</i> that one who admits to part of a claim that is brought against him is obligated to take an oath that he owes no more than the amount that he admits to have borrowed. The inference is: <b>As the admission of one’s</b> own <b>mouth should not</b> carry <b>greater</b> weight <b>than the testimony of witnesses.</b> Since in this case witnesses testify that he owes an amount equal to part of the claim, he is all the more so obligated to take an oath with regard to the rest of the sum.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> the <b><i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna also <b>taught</b> a similar <i>halakha</i>: In a case of <b>two</b> people who came to court <b>holding a garment,</b> where <b>this</b> one <b>says: I found it,</b> and the other one says: I found it, each litigant takes an oath and they divide the garment. <b>And here,</b> in the case of a found item, <b>since</b> each litigant <b>is holding</b> part of the garment, <b>it is clear to us that what</b> is in <b>this one’s grasp is his, and what</b> is in <b>that one’s grasp is his.</b> This is tantamount to witnesses testifying that part of the claim of each litigant is legitimate. <b>And</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> that each of them <b>takes an oath.</b>",
            "The Gemara clarifies: For <b>what</b> reason is it necessary to have the <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>As the admission of one’s</b> own <b>mouth should not</b> carry <b>greater</b> weight <b>than the testimony of witnesses?</b> Isn’t the comparison to the case of an admission to part of a claim self-evident? The Gemara answers: It is necessary so <b>that you will not say</b> that <b>it is</b> only in a case of <b>the admission of one’s</b> own <b>mouth that the Merciful One imposes an oath upon him, in accordance with</b> the explanation <b>of Rabba.</b>",
            "<b>As Rabba says: For what</b> reason <b>did the Torah say</b> that one who <b>admits to part of the claim must take an oath?</b> It is because there is <b>a presumption</b> that <b>a person does not exhibit insolence</b> by lying <b>in the presence of his creditor,</b> who had done him a favor by lending money to him. <b>And this</b> person who denies part of the claim actually <b>wants to deny all of</b> the debt, so as to be exempt, <b>and this</b> fact <b>that he does not deny</b> all of <b>it</b> is <b>because a person does not exhibit insolence.</b>"
        ],

            "<b>And</b> in order not to exhibit insolence, <b>this</b> person <b>wants to admit to</b> the creditor <b>with regard to all of</b> the debt, <b>and this</b> fact <b>that he denies</b> owing him in part is because he reasons: If I admit to him with regard to all of the debt, he will lodge a claim against me with regard to all of it, and right now I do not have the money to pay. <b>He was evading</b> his creditor, and <b>thought:</b> I will continue doing so <b>until I have money, and</b> then <b>I will pay</b> him all of it.

Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that the defendant’s obligation to take an oath is derived by means of <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>And what</b> is the explanation of this <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference?

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But does</b> the admission of <b>his</b> own <b>mouth not render him liable</b> to pay <b>money? But isn’t</b> the legal status of <b>the admission of a litigant similar to</b> that of <b>one hundred witnesses?</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>What</b> is the <b>money</b> that one is not liable to pay based on his own admission? It is referring to the payment of <b>a fine [<i>kenas</i>].</b> In all cases where the Torah imposes a fine, if the defendant admits his liability voluntarily he is not required to pay it. Therefore, the <i>a fortiori</i> inference is as follows: <b>If</b> the admission of one’s own <b>mouth, which does not render him liable</b> to pay <b>a fine,</b> nevertheless <b>renders him liable</b> to take <b>an oath</b> with regard to the part of the claim to which he did not admit, with regard to the testimony of <b>witnesses, which does render him liable</b> to pay <b>a fine, is it not logical that it should render him liable</b> to take <b>an oath</b> with regard to the remaining sum?",
            "The Gemara attempts to refute the inference: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about</b> the admission of one’s <b>mouth?</b> It is notable <b>in that it renders him liable</b> to bring <b>an offering.</b> One who admits that he transgressed a prohibition unwittingly is obligated to bring an offering for atonement. <b>Would you say</b> that the <i>halakhot</i> of admission apply <b>with regard to</b> the testimony of <b>witnesses, which,</b> in a case where they testify that one transgressed a prohibition, <b>does not obligate him</b> to bring <b>an offering</b> if he denies it?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult. Rabbi Ḥiyya holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir, who says</b> that the testimony of <b>witnesses renders him liable</b> to bring <b>an offering,</b> based on <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference.",
            "<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Karetot</i> 11b): If <b>two</b> witnesses <b>say to</b> a person: <b>You ate</b> forbidden <b>fat, and he says: I did not eat</b> it, <b>Rabbi Meir deems</b> him <b>liable</b> to bring an offering <b>and the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>exempt</b> from bringing an offering.",

Therefore, even if he claims that he did not sin at all, the testimony does not obligate him to bring an offering.",
            "The Gemara suggests another refutation: <b>Rather, what</b> is notable <b>about</b> the admission of one’s <b>mouth?</b> It is notable <b>in that it renders</b> a robber <b>liable</b> to bring <b>a guilt-offering.</b> One who admits that he robbed another is required to bring a guilt-offering for atonement, whereas if witnesses testify that he robbed another he is not obligated to bring a guilt-offering. The Gemara answers: <b>A guilt-offering is</b> the same as any other <b>offering,</b> about which there is a dispute between Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis as to whether the testimony of witnesses renders one liable to bring an offering.",

By contrast, if witnesses testify that he unlawfully possessed the money of another, he is not obligated to add one-fifth to his payment. The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult; Rabbi Ḥiyya holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir.

            "The Gemara rejects this: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya does not refute</b> this inference based on the punishment accompanying <b>the <i>halakhot</i> of conspiring</b> witnesses. In other words, Rabbi Ḥiyya does not accept this refutation, as while this <i>halakha</i> does not apply at all to the admission of a defendant, it does apply to the testimony of a single witness in that if two witnesses testify that the single witness is a conspiring witness, his testimony is rendered void.",

            "Concerning this ruling of Rabbi Ḥiyya, the Gemara comments: <b>And the <i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna <b>taught</b> a similar <i>halakha</i>, citing the mishna beginning: If <b>two</b> people came to court <b>holding a garment.</b>",
            "The Gemara explains the comparison: <b>And here,</b> in the mishna, <b>since</b> each one <b>grasps</b> half the garment, <b>it is clear to us that what one grasps is</b> in his possession, just as if the other one had said to him: <b>Here you are,</b> I am giving it to you. <b>And</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> that <b>he takes an oath.</b> Evidently, in a case where one denies part of a claim that is brought against him, and with regard to the rest of the claim he says to the claimant: Here you are, he is obligated to take an oath.",
            "<b>And Rav Sheshet says:</b> One who says about part of the claim: <b>Here you are,</b> and denies the rest of the claim, is <b>exempt</b> from taking an oath about the rest. <b>What is the reason?

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Sheshet, the mishna is difficult,</b> as it seems to be a comparable case and yet an oath is required.

            "The reason cited for the lack of credibility of the oath of the shepherd is that he is guilty of robbery.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But let him say:</b> I hereby take <b>an oath that all of it is mine,</b> as that is his claim. Why does he take an oath that merely half of it belongs to him? The Gemara answers: <b>And would we give him all of it</b> if he took such an oath? Since he will not be awarded the entire garment, it would be inappropriate for the court to administer to him an oath that he owns all of it.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But let him say:</b> I hereby take <b>an oath that half of it is mine.</b> Why is the complicated formulation suggested by Rav Huna necessary?

            "The Gemara challenges: <b>Now too,</b> when he takes an oath according to Rav Huna’s formulation, <b>he compromises his</b> initial <b>statement,</b> as he takes an oath only with regard to his claim to half the garment.

By contrast, if one denies receiving <b>a deposit</b> and witnesses testify that he is lying, he is <b>disqualified from bearing witness</b> in other cases. The reason for this distinction is that since money is borrowed to be spent, the assumption is that the debtor did so, and his denial is merely an attempt to buy time until he can repay the debt. A deposited item, by contrast, may not be used by the bailee, so if he denies having received the deposit he presumably stole it. Therefore, he is disqualified from bearing witness.

            "<b>When</b> on his way to Kafrei, Rabba <b>came to</b> the city of <b>Sura</b> and related the incident to the Sages there. <b>Rav Hamnuna said to him:</b> The resolution to your dilemma <b>is</b> found in the following <b>mishna</b> (<i>Teharot</i> 4:12): If there is <b>uncertainty</b> with regard to <b>firstborns, whether a human firstborn or an animal firstborn, whether</b> with regard to <b>kosher</b> animals <b>or non-kosher</b> animals, i.e., the firstborn of a donkey, <b>the burden of proof rests upon the claimant.</b> The priest may not take the animal from its owner, or the redemption payment from the child’s father. <b>And it is taught in that regard</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One is nevertheless <b>prohibited from shearing and from working</b> such animals, as their status as firstborns is uncertain.",
            "Rav Hamnuna continued: <b>And here, where</b> the mishna effectively <b>says</b> that if <b>a priest</b> forcefully <b>seized</b> an animal whose status as firstborn is uncertain the court <b>does not remove it from his possession, as it teaches</b> that <b>the burden of proof rests upon the claimant,</b> the <i>baraita</i> states that even <b>when</b> the priest <b>did not seize it,</b> one is <b>prohibited from shearing and working</b> it. Evidently, the fact that the priest would remain in possession of the animal were he to seize it suffices to accord consecrated status to the animal even in a case where the priest did not seize it. The same is true in the case of the bathhouse, that even though the one who consecrated it had not taken possession of it, his consecration takes effect.",
            "<b>Rabba said to him:</b> This is no proof, as the cases are not comparable. <b>You say</b> a ruling concerning <b>the sanctity of a firstborn. Actually, I will say to you</b> with regard to an animal whose status as firstborn is uncertain, if <b>a priest seized it,</b> the court <b>removes it from his possession,</b> as there is no validity to ownership acquired by force. Accordingly, when the mishna states that the burden of proof rests upon the claimant, it means that the priest must bring proof that the animal is a firstborn. <b>And nevertheless,</b> one is <b>prohibited from shearing and from working</b> such an animal, <b>as sanctity that emerges by itself is different.</b> The sanctity of a firstborn does not result from an act of consecration; rather, the firstborn is consecrated by itself at birth. Therefore, the uncertainty with regard to its sanctity is intrinsic, and one is prohibited from using the animal as long as the uncertainty exists.",
            "<b>Rav Ḥananya said to Rabba:</b> A <i>halakha</i> <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>that supports your</b> opinion that if a priest seizes an animal whose status as firstborn is uncertain, the court removes it from his possession: <b>The</b> animals whose status as firstborn is <b>uncertain enter the pen to be tithed.</b> They are brought in together with the rest of the young animals from whom the animal tithe is separated. This is so despite the fact that the <i>halakhot</i> of animal tithe do not apply to a firstborn animal.",
            "<b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that in the case of an animal whose status as firstborn is uncertain that is <b>seized by a priest,</b> the court <b>does not remove it from his possession, why do</b> these animals <b>enter the pen?</b> Isn’t <b>this</b> a case of the owner <b>exempting his property</b> from the animal tithe <b>with the property of a priest?</b> If the animal belongs to the priests, it cannot be used as a tithe since one is obligated to separate the animal tithe from one’s own animals.",
            "<b>Abaye said to him: If</b> your support for Rabba’s opinion is <b>due to that</b> <i>baraita</i>, it <b>does not support the Master. Here, we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the owner <b>has only nine</b> animals <b>and it,</b> the animal whose status as firstborn is uncertain. <b>Since whichever way you</b> look at it, the owner of the animals is exempt: <b>If</b> that animal is not a firstborn, it belongs to the owner and is <b>subject to the obligation</b> to be tithed as part of a group of ten animals, and the owner <b>tithes properly. And if</b> the animal is a firstborn, it belongs to the priests and the animals are <b>not subject to the obligation</b> to be tithed, since the <b>nine</b> animals belonging to an owner are <b>not subject to tithing.</b>",
            "<b>Abaye then said: That which I said is not correct, as,</b> contrary to what I said, an animal whose status as firstborn is <b>uncertain is not subject to tithing, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bekhorot</i> 58b): If before one completed tithing his animals, <b>one of</b> those already <b>counted jumped</b> back <b>into</b> the pen <b>among</b> the animals that were not yet counted, <b>all those</b> in the pen <b>are exempt</b> from the obligation to be tithed, because each of them could be the animal that was already counted.",
            "<b>And if it enters your mind</b> that an animal whose status as firstborn is <b>uncertain requires tithing, let him tithe</b> the remaining animals, as <b>whichever way you</b> look at it, his tithing would be effective. <b>Because if</b> this group of ten emerging now renders the owner <b>obligated</b> in the animal tithe, <b>he is tithing properly. And if it</b> does <b>not</b> render the owner <b>obligated</b> in the animal tithe, as one of the ten is the animal that was previously counted, nevertheless, each of the other nine <b>is exempt</b> from animal tithe <b>due to</b> the principle of <b>a tally fit</b> to reach ten.",
            "This principle is <b>as Rava says: A tally fit</b> to reach ten <b>exempts</b> oneself from the obligation to tithe. If one began counting animals for the purpose of tithing and when he began the tally the group was fit to be tithed, but ultimately he was unable to separate the tithe, for example, because one of the animals died and there were only nine left, those that were counted while the tally was fit to reach ten are exempt from the requirement of animal tithe, and the owner is not required to include them in the tithe the following year. Similarly, in a case where one of the ten animals was already counted, the other nine are nevertheless exempted by this count, as while he was counting them, the tally was fit to reach ten."

            "<b>Rather, what have you to say</b> to explain why one is not required to tithe his flock in a case where a counted animal jumped back into the pen? <b>The Merciful One states:</b> “And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, anyone that passes under the rod, the tenth shall be sacred to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:32), from which it is derived that <b>a certain tenth</b> animal must be tithed, <b>but not an uncertain tenth,</b> i.e., an animal that is not certainly the tenth. <b>Here too,</b> the entire flock is exempt from tithe because <b>the Merciful One states</b> that <b>a certain tenth</b> animal must be designated as tithe <b>and not an uncertain tenth,</b> i.e., an animal that is not certainly subject to tithe. Therefore, there is proof from the <i>baraita</i> that if a priest seizes an animal whose status as firstborn is uncertain, the court removes it from his possession.",

            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an additional proof from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> If one <b>sits</b> on an animal <b>in the field or leads</b> an animal <b>in the city,</b> he <b>acquires</b> it. This proves that one can acquire an animal by sitting on it. The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Here too,</b> the reference is to one who <b>leads,</b> i.e., drives, the animal <b>with his feet.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If so, that is</b> the same as <b>leading</b> the animal. Why would the <i>baraita</i> mention the same case twice? The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> is discussing <b>two types of leading.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so, what is the reason</b> that one who <b>sits</b> on an animal <b>in the city does not acquire</b> it? <b>Rav Kahana said:</b> It is <b>because people do not normally ride in the city,</b> as it is crowded.",
            "<b>Rav Ashi said to Rav Kahana: If that is so,</b> that by means of an unusual action one cannot effect an acquisition, then if one <b>lifted a purse</b> that he found <b>on Shabbat, has he also not acquired</b> it, <b>since people do not normally lift a purse on Shabbat</b> due to the prohibition of set-aside [<i>muktze</i>]?

            "<b>And if you would say</b> that the animal can function as a courtyard <b>when</b> it is <b>standing</b> still, not walking, while being pulled, <b>isn’t</b> there a principle which states that <b>anything that does not effect acquisition when moving</b> also <b>does not effect acquisition</b> when it is <b>standing or sitting?</b>",
            "The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that the buyer can acquire vessels by having them placed on the animal’s back only <b>when</b> the animal is <b>bound.</b> In that circumstance, when the buyer acquires the animal it assumes the legal status of his courtyard, and he also acquires the items that are placed upon the animal.",

            "Rabbi Abba continued: <b>But were Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Akiva standing next to Rabban Gamliel’s field</b> then? All of them were on the ship. Apparently, one’s courtyard effects acquisition for him even when he is not standing next to it.",

The Gemara comments: <b>Rabbi Zeira accepted</b> this response to Rabbi Abba’s objection, but <b>Rabbi Abba did not accept it.</b>",
            "<b>Rava said:</b> Rabbi Abba <b>did well by not accepting</b> this response, because if Rabban Gamliel had intended to transfer his ownership of the tithes to Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Akiva, <b>did they not have a cloth</b> with which <b>to acquire</b> the tithes <b>from him by means of</b> a symbolic <b>exchange?</b> They could have acquired the tithes through symbolic exchange without renting the land. <b>Rather,</b> clearly the tithes were not considered the property of Rabban Gamliel, as he owned only <b>the benefit of discretion,</b> i.e., the benefit accrued from the option of giving the tithes to whichever Levite or poor person that he chose, and such benefit <b>is not</b> considered <b>property that can be acquired by means of</b> a symbolic <b>exchange. Here, too,</b> the transaction was clearly effected by means of a courtyard, as <b>benefit of discretion is not property that can be acquired by means of</b> acquiring <b>land.</b> Therefore, Rabbi Abba’s explanation must be correct, and one’s courtyard effects acquisition for him even when he is not standing next to it.",
            "The Gemara rejects Rava’s reasoning: <b>But</b> that <b>is not so. With regard to gifts</b> to which members <b>of the priesthood</b> are entitled, and similarly with regard to tithes that are given to Levites and to the poor, the concept of <b>giving is written</b> in the Torah: “And have given it to the Levite, to the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow” (Deuteronomy 26:12). These gifts must be given and not sold or bartered. Therefore, since <b>exchange is a form of buying and selling,</b> it is an inappropriate mode of acquisition with regard to tithes. By contrast, transferring ownership of <b>movable property by means of</b> transferring ownership of <b>land is a powerful</b> form of <b>giving.</b> Consequently, Rabban Gamliel could not give them the tithes by means of a symbolic exchange using a cloth, but instead had to give it to them along with land. Therefore, since the transaction was not effected by means of a courtyard, it poses no difficulty to Ulla’s opinion.",
            "<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> Even if Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Akiva acquired the tithes by means of a courtyard, this poses no difficulty to Ulla’s opinion. Since the tithes were not ownerless items, but rather <b>another mind,</b> i.e., Rabban Gamliel, <b>transferred their ownership</b> to Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Akiva, it <b>is different,</b> and the recipients did not need to stand next to the courtyard.",
            "<b>And from where do you state</b> this distinction? <b>As we learned</b> in the mishna: If one <b>saw</b> people <b>running after a found</b> ownerless animal, and said: My field has effected acquisition of this animal for me, it has effected acquisition of it for him. <b>And Rabbi Yirmeya says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that this <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> true only in a case <b>where he</b> would be able to <b>run after them and catch them.

            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>But</b> if the employer <b>said to</b> the laborer: <b>Work for me today,</b> without specifying the nature of the work, the <b>found item is the employer’s,</b> as finding ownerless items is included within the general category of work. Since a Hebrew slave is duty-bound to perform all types of labor for his master, why doesn’t his master acquire all items that he finds?",
            "<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Here we are dealing with a slave who pierces pearls [<i>margaliyyot</i>], which</b> is such a profitable activity that <b>his master would not want to transfer him to another</b> line of <b>work</b> even for a moment. Therefore his status is like that of a laborer who is hired to perform a specific task.",

One would hire laborers to gather those fish.",
            "§ The mishna teaches that an item found by a Hebrew maidservant belongs to her. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances of this maidservant?

A Hebrew maidservant who reaches adulthood is emancipated.",

            "<b>As Reish Lakish says: A Hebrew maidservant acquires herself</b> from the authority of her master <b>through the death of</b> her <b>father,</b> and this <i>halakha</i> is derived <b>from an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: Signs indicating puberty release her from her master’s authority but do not release her from her father’s authority, as although she shows signs indicating puberty she remains under her father’s authority with regard to certain matters. Therefore, is it not logical that her father’s death, which releases her entirely from the father’s authority, would release her from the authority of her master? Clearly, there is no situation where a Hebrew maidservant can acquire an item that she finds. The Gemara answers: <b>But wasn’t</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish conclusively refuted?</b> It is not accepted as <i>halakha</i>.",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that <b>there is a conclusive refutation</b> of his opinion <b>from this</b> mishna <b>as well.</b> If a Hebrew maidservant is emancipated once her father dies, there is no possible situation in which a Hebrew maidservant who finds an ownerless item acquires it for herself.",
            "The Gemara rejects this suggestion: This mishna is <b>not</b> a refutation of Reish Lakish’s opinion, as perhaps it is <b>actually</b> referring to a case <b>where the father is</b> alive. <b>And what</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>They are theirs?</b> It does not mean that the item belongs to the maidservant; rather it is stated in order <b>to exclude</b> the possibility that it belongs <b>to her master.</b> The maidservant acquires the found item, and through her, her father acquires it.",
            "§ The mishna teaches that <b>the found item of his</b> ex-<b>wife,</b> whom he divorced, belongs to her, even if he has not yet given her payment of the marriage contract that he owes her. The Gemara asks: If <b>he divorced her,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that the item is hers. Why does the mishna specify this?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> there is uncertainty whether <b>she is divorced or</b> whether <b>she is not divorced. As Rabbi Zeira says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Everywhere that the Sages said</b> that there is uncertainty whether a woman <b>is divorced or</b> whether <b>she is not divorced, her husband</b> remains <b>obligated to</b> provide for <b>her sustenance.</b> Furthermore, the Sages instituted an ordinance that an item found by a wife belongs to her husband, and that this right is reciprocal to his obligation to provide for her sustenance. Therefore, one might reason that here too, since the husband is still obligated to provide for his wife he retains the right to items that she finds.",
            "But this is not the <i>halakha</i>, as <b>what is the reason</b> that <b>the Sages said</b> that an item <b>found by a wife</b> belongs <b>to her husband?</b> It is <b>so that she should not be subject to</b> her husband’s <b>enmity</b> due to the fact that he is supporting her and yet she keeps any item that she finds. <b>Here,</b> however, <b>let her be subject to much enmity.</b> He should resolve the uncertainty and finalize the divorce as soon as possible, and perhaps this enmity will facilitate reaching that goal.",

            "The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the mishna is referring to a case <b>when</b> the <b>liable party admits</b> to the debts, <b>and here, this is the reason</b> that the finder may not return the promissory notes: It is <b>that we are concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the debtor <b>wrote</b> in the promissory note that he would <b>borrow</b> the money <b>in Nisan but he did not</b> actually <b>borrow</b> the money <b>until Tishrei,</b> and between Nisan and Tishrei he sold land.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> the following difficulty arises: How will one account for the ruling of <b>the mishna</b> here, <b>which teaches</b> that <b>if</b> the promissory notes <b>include a property guarantee,</b> the finder <b>should not return</b> them to the creditor; <b>and we established</b> that the reference is to a case <b>when</b> the <b>debtor admits</b> that he still owes the debt <b>and</b> that the promissory note should not be returned <b>due to</b> suspicion that <b>perhaps</b> the debtor <b>wrote</b> it with the intention <b>to borrow</b> the money <b>in Nisan but did not</b> actually <b>borrow</b> it <b>until Tishrei, and</b> therefore, if the promissory note is returned to the creditor <b>he will come to repossess</b> the land from the <b>purchasers unlawfully.</b> If Rav Asi’s explanation is correct, <b>why shouldn’t</b> the finder <b>return</b> the document?",

            "The Gemara explains: <b>It is not necessary</b> to say that one should not return the promissory note in a case <b>where a ratification is not written in it, as</b> in that case <b>there is</b> room <b>to say</b> that the debtor <b>wrote</b> it intending <b>to borrow</b> money, <b>but he did not</b> end up <b>borrowing</b> it, and therefore the creditor has no rights to the promissory note. <b>But even if a ratification is written in it,</b> one should not return it. <b>And what is</b> this authorization?

            "By contrast, if the court said: <b>You are liable to give him</b> what you owe him, <b>and</b> subsequently the debtor <b>said: I repaid</b> the debt, <b>and the witnesses testify</b> concerning <b>him that he did not repay</b> the debt when it was demanded in their presence, <b>and</b> later the debtor <b>said again: I repaid,</b> in this case, the debtor <b>does not assume the presumptive status of one who denies</b> his debts <b>with regard to that money.</b> His claim that he repaid the debt in the absence of witnesses is accepted after he takes an oath to that effect.",
            "<b>What is the reason</b> that he is not presumed to be lying? It is because before the court verdict was finalized, the debtor was merely trying to <b>evade</b> the creditor, <b>thinking</b> to himself: Since the court has not yet finalized the verdict, I can delay payment <b>until the Sages</b> in the court <b>investigate my case</b> further, as I am not actually liable to pay until the verdict is finalized.",
            "<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥanna says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one says to another: <b>I</b> have <b>one hundred dinars in your possession</b> that you borrowed from me, <b>and the other says</b> in response: <b>Nothing</b> of <b>yours</b> is <b>in my possession, and the witnesses testify</b> concerning <b>him that,</b> in fact, <b>he does have</b> such a debt, <b>and subsequently</b> the debtor <b>said: I repaid</b> the debt, in that case the debtor <b>assumes the presumptive status of one who denies</b> his debts <b>with regard to that money.</b>",
            "It is <b>like</b> the ruling in <b>this</b> case, <b>where Shabbtai, son of Rabbi Marinus, wrote</b> a pledge <b>to</b> give <b>his daughter-in-law a cloak [<i>itztela</i>] of fine wool [<i>demileta</i>] in her marriage contract, and</b> he <b>accepted upon himself</b> the status of a guarantor for the contract. <b>Her marriage contract was lost,</b> and there was a disagreement between the parties as to its content.

            "The Gemara explains why there is no concern that perhaps the debtor does not owe the money: <b>If</b> one were to be concerned <b>because</b> perhaps the debtor <b>wrote</b> the promissory note intending <b>to borrow</b> money, <b>but</b> he ultimately <b>did not borrow</b> it, this is not a concern, as <b>a ratification is written in</b> the promissory note.

And <b>if</b> one were to be concerned <b>because</b> perhaps there was <b>repayment,</b> this is not a concern, as <b>we are not concerned</b> that there was <b>repayment on the</b> same <b>day</b> that the loan was taken, since normally one would not take a loan for less than one day.",
            "<b>Rabbi Zeira said to Rabbi Asi: Does Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> actually <b>say this?

A promissory note is valid only for the debt for which it was written.",
            "Rabbi Zeira explains: <b>When</b> did the debtor take the second loan? <b>If we say</b> that it was <b>the day after</b> the first loan, when the promissory note was written, <b>or another</b> later <b>date,</b> then Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement is difficult. <b>Why</b> does he <b>specifically</b> give as the reason for the promissory note’s disqualification: <b>As its lien is already forgiven?</b> Instead, he should <b>derive</b> the disqualification of the promissory note from the fact <b>that it is antedated,</b> i.e., dated prior to the actual loan, <b>and we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shevi’it</i> 10:5): <b>Antedated promissory notes are invalid.</b> Therefore, Rabbi Yoḥanan could not have been referring to a case where the second loan took place after the date of the first loan.",
            "<b>Rather, is</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement <b>not</b> referring to a case where the second loan took place <b>on the</b> same <b>day</b> as the first loan? <b>Evidently, people do</b> occasionally <b>repay</b> their loans <b>on the</b> same <b>day</b> as they take the loan.",
            "Rabbi Asi <b>said to him: Did I say that</b> people <b>do not repay</b> their loans on the same day <b>at all?</b> Rather, <b>I said that</b> it is <b>uncommon</b> for <b>people to repay</b> their loans <b>on the same day.</b> Therefore, if a note is found on the same day it was written, it is reasonable to assume that it has not yet been repaid, even though there is a remote possibility that it has.",
            "<b>Rav Kahana says</b> an alternative explanation: Rabbi Yoḥanan is referring to a case <b>when</b> the <b>liable party,</b> i.e., the debtor, <b>admits</b> to the debt. The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so, what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> that the note may be returned? This is obvious.",

And</b> the reason he prefers to claim that he did not repay the first debt is that he is <b>concerned about</b> saving <b>the scribe’s fee</b> that he would have to pay for another promissory note. Therefore, Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>teaches us</b> that this possibility need not be taken into account, <b>as, if that were so,</b> the <b>creditor himself would not allow</b> such a scheme. He would be afraid to act in such a manner, <b>thinking: The Sages will hear about me</b> that I reused the note, <b>and will cause me to lose</b> the payment owed to me.",
            "The Gemara asks: In <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from that which we learned</b> in a mishna (12b): With regard to one who <b>found promissory notes, if they include a property guarantee</b> for a loan, <b>he may not return</b> them to the creditor.",
            "<b>And we interpreted</b> this mishna as referring to a case <b>when the liable party admits</b> to the debt. <b>And</b> the reason the promissory notes may not be returned is <b>due to</b> the concern that <b>perhaps</b> the debtor <b>wrote</b> the note in order <b>to borrow</b> the money <b>in Nisan, but</b> he ultimately <b>did not borrow</b> it <b>until Tishrei, and</b> the creditor will <b>come to unlawfully repossess</b> land from <b>purchasers</b> who bought the debtor’s land <b>between Nisan and Tishrei.</b> He is entitled to collect land only from those who bought land from the debtor after the loan took place, causing the lien on the debtor’s land to take effect.",
            "The Gemara points out the contradiction between this mishna and Rabbi Kahana’s explanation of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement: <b>And</b> this indicates that <b>we do not say that if that were so,</b> if the promissory note were antedated, the <b>creditor himself would not allow</b> the debtor to use it, <b>as he would say to him: Write another note</b> dated properly <b>in Tishrei, lest the Sages hear</b> about the fact that the date is incorrect <b>and</b> disqualify the promissory note, <b>causing me to lose</b> the money.",
            "The Gemara answers: The Sages <b>say</b> that <b>there,</b> in the case of the mishna, <b>since</b> the creditor <b>benefits</b> by using this promissory note, <b>as</b> he can <b>repossess</b> land from <b>purchasers</b> who bought from the debtor <b>between Nisan and Tishrei, it is satisfactory to him, and he does not say anything</b> to the debtor about using this promissory note. By contrast, <b>here,</b> in the case to which Rabbi Yoḥanan is referring, <b>since</b> the creditor <b>does not benefit</b> from reusing the promissory note, <b>as ultimately, the note is written</b> for the <b>current</b> date, <b>what is there</b> for him <b>to repossess</b> from <b>purchasers</b> by means of the note that he cannot repossess by means of a new promissory note?

            "<b>If we say</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is derived <b>from that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ketubot</i> 54b): If a woman <b>became widowed or divorced, whether from betrothal or from marriage, she collects all</b> that she is entitled to, both the main sum of her marriage contract instituted by the Sages and the additional sum that her husband added; that mishna cannot serve as a source for the <i>halakha</i> that a widow from her betrothal has the right to receive payment of her marriage contract.

            "<b>Rather, Abaye retracted</b> his objection to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s proof from the mishna, not because of the case of a widow from betrothal, but due to an indication <b>from</b> within <b>the mishna itself.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, Rabba does not state</b> his explanation <b>in accordance with</b> that of <b>Rabbi Zeira</b> and raise a contradiction from the <i>baraita</i>, as <b>he</b> holds that <b>a mishna</b> serves as <b>a stronger</b> basis <b>for raising a difficulty</b> than a <i>baraita</i>, as the Mishna, redacted by Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, employs more precise language; <b>but what is the reason</b> that <b>Rabbi Zeira does not state</b> his explanation <b>in accordance with</b> that of <b>Rabba</b> and raise a contradiction from the Mishna?",
            "The Gemara answers: Rabbi Zeira could have <b>said to you: Does</b> the mishna actually <b>teach that</b> if the one who wrote the document <b>says: Give</b> it to the intended recipient, the finder <b>must give</b> it to him, <b>and</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> if <b>a long time</b> passed since it was lost?

            "The Gemara asks: <b>According to the one who says</b> that <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Zeira</b> a document may not be returned <b>in a place where</b> passing <b>caravans are common, and</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even if</b> it was <b>not established</b> that there are <b>two</b> people named <b>Yosef ben Shimon</b> in town, <b>and he disagrees with Rabba, with regard to what do</b> Rabbi Zeira and Rabba <b>disagree?</b> What is the foundation of their dispute?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rabba maintains</b> his opinion based on the mishna (20a) <b>that teaches: One must return any court enactment.</b> He understands that <b>we are dealing with</b> a document <b>that was found in court, and a court is equivalent to a place where</b> passing <b>caravans are common.

            "<b>Rabbi Yirmeya states</b> an alternative resolution to the contradiction between the mishna here and the <i>baraita</i>, on the one hand, and the mishna in <i>Gittin</i> on the other: A found bill of divorce should be returned only in a case <b>where</b> the <b>witnesses</b> who signed the bill of divorce <b>say: We have never signed a bill of divorce of</b> a person named <b>Yosef ben Shimon other than</b> this <b>one,</b> in which case there is no concern that the bill of divorce belongs to someone else.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so, what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> that one returns the bill of divorce? Since it clearly belongs to him, there is no question that it must be returned to him.

            "The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> Rav Ashi permits one to return such a bill of divorce <b>specifically</b> when the one claiming to have lost it says that the hole is <b>next to such and such a letter,</b> as that is a clear-cut distinguishing mark. <b>But</b> if he said <b>only</b> that it had <b>a hole</b> without mentioning its precise location, one should <b>not</b> return the bill of divorce, as that is not considered a clear-cut distinguishing mark.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>Rav Ashi is uncertain whether</b> a lost item is returned to its owner on the basis of <b>distinguishing marks by Torah law</b> or <b>whether</b> it is <b>by rabbinic law.</b> Therefore, in the case of a bill of divorce, he holds that one may rely only on a clear-cut distinguishing mark, as everyone agrees that a lost item is returned to its owner on the basis of a clear-cut distinguishing mark by Torah law.",

            "According to the Gemara’s suggestion with regard to a bill of divorce, <b>there,</b> in the case of a promissory note, it <b>should also be returned, and when</b> the creditor <b>comes to repossess</b> the debtor’s property that was sold in the interim, <b>let</b> the court <b>say to him:</b> First <b>bring proof</b> as to <b>when</b> the <b>promissory note came into your possession.</b>",
            "The Sages <b>say</b> that it is not comparable. <b>Here, with regard to a woman’s bill of divorce,</b> the <b>purchaser</b> will <b>come and demand</b> that the wife prove when it was given to her, as he will <b>say</b> to himself: The fact <b>that the Sages returned the bill of divorce to her</b> was only <b>so that she would not dwell</b> alone as <b>a deserted wife</b> and not be able to remarry for lack of a bill of divorce. <b>Now that she is coming to repossess</b> the property her husband sold me, <b>she should go and bring proof</b> as to <b>when the bill of divorce came into her possession.</b>",
            "By contrast, <b>here, with regard to a promissory note, the purchaser will not come and demand</b> proof, because he will infer <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the Sages returned</b> the <b>promissory note to him</b> that it is <b>obviously</b> valid from the date written in it.

            "The Gemara digresses with a related incident: <b>Ameimar, Mar Zutra, and Rav Ashi happened to</b> come to <b>the orchard [<i>levustana</i>] of Mari bar Isak.

            "<b>Ameimar and Rav Ashi said to Mar Zutra: Now why is the Master not eating the fruit?

He did not really want to give them the fruit.",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another proof from a <i>baraita</i> with regard to despair that is not conscious. It is written: “And if any part of their carcass falls upon any sowing seed that is to be sown, it is ritually pure. But when water is placed upon the seed, and any part of their carcass falls thereon, it is ritually impure unto you” (Leviticus 11:37–38). Produce becomes susceptible to contracting ritual impurity only after coming into contact with one of seven liquids: Wine, honey, oil, milk, dew, blood, and water. It is taught in the <i>baraita</i>: If <b>the dew is still upon</b> the produce and has not yet dried, and if the owner <b>was glad</b> that the dew moistened the produce and kept it fresh, <b>that</b> produce falls into the category of: “But <b>when</b> water <b>is placed</b> upon the seed,” and the produce is susceptible to contracting ritual impurity. If the produce <b>had dried</b> when the owner found it, then <b>even though he was glad</b> that the dew had moistened the produce,"
        ],
        [
            "the produce <b>is not</b> in the category of: “But <b>when</b> water <b>is placed [<i>khi yuttan</i>]</b> upon the seed,” and the produce is not susceptible to contracting ritual impurity.",
            "<b>What is the reason</b> that if the produce dried, the fact that the owner is glad does not render it susceptible to ritual impurity? Is it <b>not due to</b> the fact <b>that we do not say: Since the matter was revealed that he is amenable</b> to the moisture <b>now, he was also amenable from the outset?</b> The same should be true with regard to despair that is not conscious. The fact that when he becomes aware of his loss he despairs of its recovery does not indicate that he despaired from the outset, contrary to the opinion of Rava. The Gemara rejects the proof: It <b>is different there, as</b> although the phrase is vocalized to mean: “When it is placed,” <b>it is written: When one places [<i>ki yitten</i>],</b> from which it is derived that the produce is rendered susceptible to ritual impurity <b>only</b> if the owner <b>places</b> the liquid on the produce.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> in <b>the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>too,</b> the produce should not be rendered susceptible to contracting impurity, because the dew fell on the produce and was not placed there by the owner. The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> the explanation is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Pappa, as Rav Pappa raised a contradiction:</b> The verse states: “But when water is placed [<i>vekhi yuttan</i>] upon the seed, and any part of a carcass falls thereon, it is ritually impure unto you” (Leviticus 11:38). The word “<i>yuttan</i>” <b>is written</b> in the defective form, as if it says <b>“<i>ki yitten</i>.”</b> Accordingly, this would mean that one must actively place the water on the produce. Yet, <b>we read</b> it, based on the tradition as to its correct pronunciation, as if it is written <b>“<i>ki yuttan</i>,”</b> which includes any situation where the produce becomes wet. <b>How so?</b> How can the way the verse is written and the way it is read be reconciled?",
            "Rav Pappa explains that <b>we require</b> that the situation described by the words <b>“when water is placed [<i>ki yuttan</i>]”</b> be <b>similar to</b> the situation described by the words: <b>When one places [<i>dekhi yitten</i>]: Just as</b> the term <b>places [<i>yitten</i>]</b> indicates <b>that</b> it is <b>with the knowledge of</b> the owner that the produce becomes wet, as he himself is placing the water, <b>so too,</b> the term <b>“is placed [<i>yuttan</i>]”</b> means <b>that</b> it is <b>with his knowledge</b> that the produce becomes wet, despite the fact that he did not place the water himself. Therefore, no proof may be cited with regard to the matter of despair, where there is no Torah derivation requiring awareness from the outset.",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from that <b>which Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Yishmael ben Yehotzadak: From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to a lost item that the river swept away that it is permitted</b> for its finder to keep it?

The verse states that one must return <b>that which is lost from him,</b> the owner, <b>but is</b> available to be <b>found by any person. Excluded</b> from that obligation is <b>that which is lost from him and is not</b> available to be <b>found by any person;</b> it is ownerless property and anyone who finds it may keep it.",
            "<b>And the prohibition</b> written in the verse against keeping an item that is lost only to its owner is <b>similar to the allowance</b> to keep an item lost to all people that is inferred from the verse; <b>just as</b> in the case of <b>the allowance, whether there is a distinguishing mark and whether there is no distinguishing mark,</b> it is permitted for the finder to keep it, <b>so too</b> in the case of <b>the prohibition, whether there is a distinguishing mark and whether there is no distinguishing mark,</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> for the finder to keep it, until there is proof that the owner despaired of its recovery.

            "<b>And Rav Shemaya bar Ze’eira says</b> in explanation of the mishna: <b>What is the reason</b> that during the rest of the year the money is considered non-sacred, even on the day after the Festival? <b>Since the markets of Jerusalem tend to be cleaned every day,</b> any money left there would already have been found by the street cleaners. Consequently, any money found there must have been left there recently. <b>Apparently, we say</b> that <b>each of the first</b> coins <b>is gone, and these</b> coins <b>are other</b> ones, i.e., they were left there after the conclusion of the Festival. <b>Here too,</b> with regard to lost items found in a rented house, why not say that the items belonging <b>to each of the first</b> renters <b>are gone and these</b> items belong <b>to the last</b> renter?",

The <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> a case of <b>grazing on the path, where</b> the animal is <b>not</b> considered <b>lost property, and the same is true</b> of a case where the animal is <b>grazing among the vineyards.</b> And the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> a case of <b>running through the vineyards, where</b> the animal <b>is</b> considered <b>lost property, and the same is true of</b> a case where the animal is <b>running on the path.</b>",
            "<b>Rava said to him: If</b> the <i>tanna</i> employs the style of: <b>Its counterpart tells about it, let him teach the lenient</b> case <b>and all the more so</b> it would apply to <b>the stringent</b> case. The Gemara elaborates: <b>Let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach</b> that when the animal is <b>running on the path it is lost property and all the more so</b> it is lost property when it is <b>running through the vineyards.

            "<b>Rather, Rava said:</b> The apparent contradiction <b>between</b> the inference from the first clause with regard to <b>running</b> on the path and the inference from the latter clause with regard to <b>running</b> on the path is <b>not difficult.

            "Rava continues: The apparent contradiction <b>between</b> the inference from the first clause with regard to <b>grazing</b> among the vineyards and the inference from the latter clause with regard to <b>grazing</b> among the vineyards is <b>also not difficult.

There,</b> the inference from the first clause that the <i>halakhot</i> of lost property apply in the case of an animal grazing among the vineyards is referring to <b>loss</b> in the sense of damage <b>to the land.</b>",
            "The Gemara elaborates: <b>When</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> that in the case of an animal <b>grazing on the path,</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>lost property do not</b> apply, from which it is inferred: <b>But</b> in the case of an animal <b>grazing among the vineyards</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>lost property do</b> apply, it is referring to preventing <b>loss</b> in the sense of damage <b>to the land</b> caused by the animal. <b>And when</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> that in the case of an animal <b>running among the vineyards</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>lost property do</b> apply, from which it is inferred: <b>But</b> in the case of an animal <b>grazing among the vineyards</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>lost property do not</b> apply, it is referring <b>to loss of</b> the animal <b>itself, as</b> an animal <b>running among the vineyards</b> is typically <b>wounded</b> with lacerations from the vines, <b>but</b> an animal <b>grazing among the vineyards</b> is <b>not</b> typically <b>wounded.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to the inference from the latter clause that in the case of an animal <b>grazing among the vineyards</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of lost property do not apply, <b>although it is not wounded,</b> why not <b>derive</b> that the <i>halakhot</i> of lost property do apply <b>due to loss</b> in the sense of damage <b>to the land</b> caused by the animal?

The Gemara explains: <b>If they</b> already <b>forewarned</b> the owner <b>with regard to</b> the animal <b>and</b> the owner <b>did not heed</b> the warning, <b>this is certainly</b> a case of <b>deliberate loss,</b> where there is no obligation to return it.",

The fact that <b>it does not secure</b> the animal is learned <b>from</b> the fact that it <b>was necessary</b> for the <i>tanna</i> <b>to teach: He is not obligated in its</b> return.",
            "The Gemara continues its explanation of Rava’s statement: <b>As, if it enters your mind</b> to say that it is a stable that <b>secures</b> the animal, that ruling would be extraneous. <b>Now</b> that in a case where one <b>found</b> the animal <b>outside</b> a stable <b>he brings it inside</b> a stable of that type and thereby returns the animal to its owner, in a case where he <b>found</b> the animal <b>inside</b> the stable is it <b>necessary</b> to teach that he is not obligated to return it to its owner? <b>Rather, learn from it</b> that the stable mentioned in the mishna does <b>not secure</b> the animal and therefore there is a possibility that one must return it. The Gemara affirms: Indeed, <b>learn from it</b> that it is a stable that neither encourages the animal to stray nor secures the animal.",
            "§ The mishna teaches: If <b>one found</b> an animal <b>in a stable</b> belonging to its owner, <b>he is not obligated</b> to return it. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: And that</b> is the <i>halakha</i> only in a case <b>where</b> the animal <b>is standing within the</b> city <b>limits.</b> The Gemara concludes <b>by inference that</b> if the animal was <b>found in a public area</b> he is obligated to return it, <b>and even</b> if it was <b>within the</b> city <b>limits,</b> he is <b>also obligated</b> to return it.",
            "<b>There are those who teach</b> this statement <b>with regard to the latter clause</b> of the mishna: If he found it <b>in a public area,</b> he is <b>obligated</b> to return <b>it. Rabbi Yitzḥak says: And that</b> is the <i>halakha</i> only in a case <b>where</b> the animal <b>is standing beyond the</b> city <b>limits.</b> The Gemara concludes <b>by inference that</b> in a case where the animal was <b>found in the stable, even</b> if the animal <b>is standing beyond the</b> city <b>limits, he is also not obligated in its</b> return.",
            "§ The mishna teaches: <b>And if</b> the animal <b>was</b> lost <b>in a graveyard</b> and was found by a priest, <b>he may not become impure to</b> return <b>it.</b> In a case where a priest’s father said to him: Become impure, or in a case where one was obligated to return the animal and his father said to him: Do not return it, he may not listen to his father. The Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> in which <b>the Sages taught: From where</b> is it derived <b>that if</b> a priest’s <b>father said to him: Become impure, or that</b> if one’s father <b>said to him: Do not return</b> a lost item that you found; <b>he should not listen to him?</b> It is derived from the verse, <b>as it is stated: “Every man shall fear his mother and his father, and you shall observe My <i>Shabbatot</i>; I am the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 19:3). From the fact that the verse concludes: “I am the Lord,” it is derived that: <b>You are all,</b> parent and child alike, <b>obligated in My honor.</b> Therefore, if a parent commands his child to refrain from observing a mitzva, he must not obey the command.",
            "The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> that a priest must not obey his father’s command to become impure is <b>because the Merciful One writes: “You shall observe My <i>Shabbatot</i>;</b> I am the Lord”; <b>but</b> if <b>it were not so, I would say</b> that the child <b>must obey him.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But why? This</b> obligation to obey a parent is <b>a positive mitzva,</b> as it is written: “Honor your father and your mother” (Exodus 20:12), <b>and that</b> obligation of a priest to refrain from becoming impure is both <b>a prohibition:</b> “To the dead among his people he shall not defile himself” (Leviticus 21:1), <b>and a positive mitzva:</b> “You shall be holy” (Leviticus 19:2); <b>and</b> the principle is that <b>a positive mitzva does not come and override a prohibition and a positive mitzva.</b>",
            "The Gemara answers that the derivation from “You shall observe My <i>Shabbatot</i>; I am the Lord” <b>was necessary,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say: Since honoring one’s father and mother is equated to the honor of the Omnipresent, as it is stated here: “Honor your father and your mother”</b> (Exodus 20:12), <b>and it is stated elsewhere: “Honor the Lord with your wealth”</b> (Proverbs 3:9), <b>therefore,</b> one might have thought that the priest must <b>obey his</b> father’s command to become impure. Therefore the Torah <b>teaches us that</b> the priest is commanded <b>not to listen to him.</b>",
            "§ The mishna teaches: There is <b>a mitzva by Torah law to unload</b> a burden, <b>but</b> there is <b>no</b> mitzva <b>to load</b> it. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>But</b> there is <b>no</b> mitzva <b>to load</b> it? <b>If we say</b> that it means: <b>But</b> there is <b>no</b> mitzva <b>to load</b> it <b>at all; what is different</b> about <b>unloading, with regard to which it is written: “You shall release it with him”</b> (Exodus 23:5)? With regard to <b>loading as well, isn’t it written: “You shall lift them with him”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:4)?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> there is <b>a mitzva by Torah law to unload</b> the burden <b>for free, but</b> there is <b>no</b> mitzva <b>to load</b> it <b>for free; rather,</b> the mitzva is performed <b>with remuneration. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> There is <b>also</b> a mitzva <b>to load</b> it <b>for free.</b> The Gemara states: <b>We learn</b> by inference from the mishna <b>that which the Sages taught</b> explicitly in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Unloading</b> is performed <b>for free,</b> and <b>loading</b> is performed <b>with remuneration. Rabbi Shimon said:</b> Both <b>this and that</b> are performed <b>for free.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of the Rabbis</b> that there is a distinction between unloading and loading with regard to remuneration? The reason is <b>that if it enters your mind</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, let the Merciful One write</b> only the mitzva of <b>loading, and</b> then He would <b>need not</b> write the mitzva of <b>unloading, and I would say: Just as</b> with regard to <b>loading, where there is no</b> potential <b>suffering of animals and there is no</b> potential <b>monetary loss</b> for the owner, one is <b>obligated</b> to load the burden, with regard to <b>unloading, where there is</b> potential <b>suffering of animals and there is</b> potential <b>monetary loss</b> for the owner, is it <b>not all the more so</b> clear that one is required to unload the burden? <b>Rather, with regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> did <b>the Merciful One write</b> the mitzva of unloading? It is <b>to tell you:</b> The mitzva of <b>unloading</b> the burden is performed <b>for free, but</b> the mitzva of <b>loading</b> is performed <b>with remuneration.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who holds that even loading is performed for free, <b>what is the reason</b> that the Torah writes the mitzva of unloading? The Gemara answers: It is <b>because the verses are not</b> clearly <b>defined,</b> and it is unclear which of the verses refers to loading and which refers to unloading. Had the Torah written one verse, it would have been interpreted with regard to unloading, and there would be no source that one needs to load an animal.",
            "<b>And the Rabbis</b> could ask: <b>Why</b> does Rabbi Shimon say that <b>the verses are not</b> clearly <b>defined? Here it is written: “Collapsed under its burden”</b> (Exodus 23:5), clearly referring to the case of a burden that needs unloading, and <b>there it is written: “Fallen down by the way”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:4), <b>indicating</b> that both the animals <b>and their burdens are</b> lying <b>on the way</b> and are in need of loading. <b>And Rabbi Shimon</b> explains that the verses are not defined because the phrase <b>“fallen down by the way”</b> could be understood as <b>indicating</b> that the animals are fallen <b>with their burdens upon them,</b> and referring to unloading.",

            "The Gemara rejects that proof. <b>Perhaps</b> the <i>a fortiori</i> inference is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that there is</b> the factor of <b>monetary loss</b> in unloading but not in loading, <b>and this is what</b> the Rabbis <b>are saying: If</b> in the case of <b>loading, where</b> if one fails to assist the owner <b>there is no</b> potential <b>monetary loss,</b> one is <b>obligated</b> to help load the animal, in the case of <b>unloading, where</b> if one fails to assist the owner <b>there is</b> potential <b>monetary loss,</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> clear that one is required to unload the burden?",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But is there no</b> potential <b>monetary loss in loading?

            "The Gemara cites an additional proof: <b>Know that</b> the requirement to prevent <b>suffering to animals</b> is <b>by Torah law, as it is taught</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: If there was</b> a burden <b>upon</b> the animal <b>greater than</b> its typical <b>burden, one need not attend to it, as it is stated: “Under its burden”</b> (Exodus 23:5).

            "The Gemara rejects that proof: <b>Perhaps</b> it is with regard to the meaning of the phrase <b>“under its burden”</b> that they <b>disagree, as Rabbi Yosei</b> HaGelili <b>holds that we interpret</b> the phrase <b>“under its burden”</b> to mean: <b>A burden that</b> the animal <b>can bear.

            "The Gemara cites an additional proof: <b>Know that</b> the requirement to prevent <b>suffering to animals</b> is <b>not by Torah law, as it is taught</b> in <b>the former clause</b> of the mishna: If the owner <b>went, and sat, and said</b> to a passerby: <b>Since</b> there is <b>a mitzva</b> incumbent <b>upon you to unload</b> the burden, <b>unload</b> it, the passerby is <b>exempt, as it is stated:</b> “You shall release it <b>with him”</b> (Exodus 23:5). <b>And if it enters your mind that</b> the requirement to prevent <b>suffering to animals</b> is <b>by Torah law, what</b> is it <b>to me</b> if <b>its owner is</b> working <b>with</b> the passerby <b>and what</b> is it <b>to me</b> if <b>its owner is not</b> working <b>with</b> the passerby?

            "The Gemara rejects that proof: <b>Actually,</b> one could say that the requirement to prevent <b>suffering to animals</b> is <b>by Torah law.</b> And when the <i>tanna</i> exempts the passerby when the owner does not participate in unloading the burden, <b>do you maintain</b> that <b>exempt</b> means <b>completely exempt?

            "<b>Let us say</b> that a <i>baraita</i> <b>supports</b> Rava’s opinion that the requirement to prevent suffering to animals is by Torah law: If one encounters <b>the animal of a gentile</b> collapsed under its burden, <b>he tends to it</b> and unloads its burden, <b>as</b> he would <b>the animal of a Jew.</b> The Gemara reasons: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the requirement to prevent <b>suffering to animals</b> is <b>by Torah law,</b> it is <b>due to that</b> reason that <b>he tends to it as</b> he would <b>the animal of a Jew. But if you say</b> that the requirement to prevent <b>suffering to animals</b> is <b>not by Torah law, why does he tend to it as</b> he would <b>the animal of a Jew?</b> The Gemara rejects the proof: <b>There</b> one tends to the animal <b>due to enmity</b> that would arise if gentiles see Jews assisting their own people and not gentiles. The obligation is not due to the requirement to prevent suffering of animals.",
            "<b>So too, it is reasonable</b> to explain the <i>baraita</i> in this manner, <b>as it is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>If</b> the animal of a gentile <b>was loaded</b> with <b>wine</b> used for <b>a libation</b> to idolatry, and the animal is collapsed under its burden, a Jew <b>does not attend to it.

The Gemara answers that <b>this</b> is what the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying: And to load</b> the animal with <b>wine</b> used for <b>a libation</b> to idolatry, <b>he does not attend to it.</b> Loading an animal does not alleviate its suffering. Furthermore, the refusal of the Jew to handle the libation wine will not cause enmity, because he can explain that his religion precludes him from handling these materials.",

By employing the phrase “you shall forgo,” the verse indicates that there are circumstances in which one may forgo unloading the animal.

            "the statement of <b>Rav Huna is so, once</b> the <b>creditor takes an oath that</b> the collateral <b>is not in his possession, how can he produce it</b> thereafter? <b>Rava said:</b> The mishna is referring to a case <b>where there are witnesses that</b> the collateral <b>was burned.</b> Therefore, the creditor need not take an oath that it is not in his possession.",

There is no concern that the creditor will produce the collateral. <b>From where will he bring it</b> if it was burned? <b>Rather, Rav Yosef said:</b> The mishna is referring to a case <b>where there are witnesses that</b> the collateral <b>was stolen.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Ultimately,</b> in that case too, <b>from where will</b> the creditor <b>bring</b> the collateral if it was stolen? The Gemara answers: Although the collateral had been stolen, it is possible the creditor will <b>exert</b> himself to locate the thief <b>and bring</b> the collateral, thereby proving that the debtor took a false oath.",

The Gemara answers: This is unlikely. <b>Granted,</b> there is concern that the <b>creditor</b> will recover the stolen collateral, as he <b>knows who enters and exits his house,</b> so he may have some inkling of the identity of the thief. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>he goes and exerts</b> himself <b>and brings</b> the collateral. <b>But</b> with regard to the <b>debtor, does he know who enters and exits the creditor’s house?</b> He has no inkling who the thief might be.",
            "<b>Abaye says:</b> Although the creditor takes an oath that the collateral is not in his possession, the obligation to take an oath for partial admission is transferred from the debtor to the creditor, as the Sages issued <b>a decree lest</b> the debtor take the oath for his partial admission and the creditor <b>claim and say to him: I found</b> the collateral <b>after</b> you took the <b>oath.

The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> if so, <b>let the debtor trust the creditor with regard to this</b> matter of <b>how much</b> the collateral <b>was worth.</b> The Gemara explains: The creditor is <b>not certain about</b> the value of the collateral, as the item did not belong to him, which is why the debtor does not rely upon him to take an oath concerning its value. The Gemara challenges: <b>But let the creditor trust the debtor, as</b> the debtor is <b>certain about</b> the value of the collateral, as it is his.

            "Rava continues: <b>What is the reason</b> he did not answer me? The reason is that the cases cannot be compared. <b>There,</b> in the case of the mishna, the bailee paid at his own initiative. <b>He did not inconvenience</b> the owner by compelling him <b>to go to court.</b> Therefore, the owner transfers ownership of the deposit to the bailee. <b>Here,</b> in the case involving the jewels, the bailee <b>inconvenienced</b> the owner and compelled him <b>to go to court.</b> Consequently, the owner does not transfer ownership of the deposit to the bailee.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that Rav Naḥman holds that</b> after property is repossessed in order to pay an unpaid debt based on the court’s <b>appraisal</b> of the article’s value, it is <b>returned</b> if the debtor pays the debt? The Gemara rejects that conclusion: In general, the item is not returned.

Therefore, the woman does not have the right to sell the property as long as they are married. If she sold the property and died, and her husband is her heir, the Sages instituted that his legal status is that of a buyer and not an heir. His rights to the land precede those of the subsequent buyers. He repossesses the land and reimburses them the sale price of the property."

By contrast, once the buyer paid for the item he cannot renege on his decision and demand return of his money, even if he did not yet take possession of the purchase item.",

The <i>halakha</i> is that one who desacralizes his own produce must add one-fifth to its value.

            "The Gemara relates: <b>And even Rav Pappa retracted his</b> previous statement that coins are acquired by means of a transaction of exchange, <b>as</b> in <b>this</b> incident in <b>which Rav Pappa had twelve thousand dinars</b> that he lent to another in <b>Bei Ḥozai.

This obviated the need for him to consult Rav Pappa in the case of every contingency, which would complicate matters. It is apparent from the fact that the transaction was effected by means of granting acquisition of the threshold that Rav Pappa concedes that coins are not acquired by means of a transaction of exchange. <b>When</b> Rav Shmuel bar Aḥa <b>came</b> after repayment of the loan, Rav Pappa was so pleased that he <b>went out as far as Tevakh to</b> meet <b>him.</b>",

And likewise, Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Money cannot be</b> the item used to effect a transaction by means of <b>exchange.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Abba raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Ulla</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one whose donkey drivers or laborers were demanding</b> payment of their wages <b>from him in the marketplace, and he said to the money changer: Give me coins</b> worth <b>a dinar and I will provide for them, and</b> later <b>I will give you</b> coins <b>worth a dinar and a <i>tereisit</i>,</b> a coin of lesser value, <b>from money that I have at home,</b> then <b>if he has money</b> at home at that time it is <b>permitted,</b> as it is not considered a loan and therefore the additional payment is not interest. <b>But if</b> he does <b>not</b> have money at home at that time, it is a loan and the additional payment is <b>forbidden</b> as interest. <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that <b>money cannot be</b> the item used to effect a transaction by means of <b>exchange,</b> then even in the case where the employer had money at home, since the money changer does not acquire the employer’s money at home by means of exchange, <b>it is a loan and</b> the additional payment is <b>forbidden</b> as interest. Ulla <b>was silent.</b>",
            "Rabbi Abba then <b>said</b> the following suggestion <b>to</b> Ulla: <b>Perhaps</b> the Sages <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>in</b> a case where both <b>these</b> coins that are in his house <b>and those</b> coins that he took from the money changer are <b><i>perotetot</i>,</b> small <i>perutot</i> <b>that are unminted, and</b> the legal status of both <b>these</b> coins <b>and those</b> coins <b>is</b> that of <b>a commodity; and due to that</b> status <b>they are acquired by means of</b> a transaction of <b>exchange.</b> Ulla <b>said to him: Yes,</b> that is the case in the <i>baraita</i>, and the language of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is also precise, as it teaches:</b> I will give you coins <b>worth a dinar and a <i>tereisit</i>, and it does not teach:</b> I will give you <b>an unflawed dinar and a <i>tereisit</i>.</b> Evidently, the <i>baraita</i> is not referring to his giving an actual dinar coin but to other coins of lesser value that equal that value. The Gemara affirms: <b>Learn from it</b> that this is the case.",
            "<b>Rav Ashi said: Actually,</b> it can be explained that there is no transaction by means of exchange in this case.

Therefore, one should not infer that the <i>halakha</i> is the same with regard to coins.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> to interpret the mishna in that manner, <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause</b> of that mishna <b>teaches: How so?</b> If <b>one exchanges an ox for a cow, or a donkey for an ox,</b> once this party acquires the animal that he is receiving, this party is obligated with regard to the item being exchanged for it. This clause apparently explains the previous clause, and employs the example of animals, not coins. The Gemara concludes: <b>Learn from it</b> that the reference in the mishna is to movable property, not to coins.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard <b>to what entered our minds initially,</b> that <b>a coin</b> effects symbolic <b>exchange, what</b> is the meaning of the clause: <b>How so;</b> if one exchanges an ox for a cow, once this party acquires the animal that he is receiving, this party is obligated with regard to the item being exchanged for it? This example does not involve a coin. The Gemara explains that it was assumed that <b>this is what</b> the mishna <b>is saying:</b> Not only can a coin be used in the act of acquisition of exchange, <b>but produce,</b> i.e., movable property, <b>can also effect exchange. How so?</b> If <b>one exchanged</b> the meat of <b>an ox for a cow, or</b> the meat of <b>a donkey for an ox,</b> once this party acquires the item that he is receiving, this party is obligated with regard to the item being exchanged for it.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>This works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Sheshet, who said: Produce effects</b> a transaction of <b>exchange.

            "The Gemara answers that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying: There is</b> a purchase with <b>money</b> where one acquires the purchase item without pulling it <b>that is like</b> a transaction of <b>exchange. How so?</b> It is in a case where <b>one exchanged</b> the <b>monetary</b> value of <b>an ox for a cow, or</b> the <b>monetary</b> value of <b>a donkey for an ox.</b> In this case, one sold his ox to another for an agreed sum of money, and after the buyer acquired the ox by pulling it, he then offered to give the seller his cow in exchange for the money that he owes him. In this case the cow is acquired without the seller having to pull it. Although this acquisition initially was to be an exchange, it is ultimately a purchase for money, as the second animal is acquired as a result of the forgiving of the monetary debt.",
            "The Gemara inquires: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rav Naḥman?</b> The Gemara explains: Rav Naḥman <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, who says: By Torah law money effects acquisition,</b> i.e., when one pays money he acquires the item, even if he has not yet performed another act of acquisition. <b>And for what reason did</b> the Sages <b>say</b> that <b>pulling acquires</b> an item and money does not? This is a rabbinic <b>decree lest</b> the seller <b>say to</b> the buyer after receiving the money: <b>Your wheat was burned in the upper story.</b> If a fire breaks out or some other mishap occurs after a seller receives the money, he will not bother to save the goods in his house because they no longer belong to him, and the buyer may incur a loss.",
            "The Sages therefore decreed that acquisition takes effect only when a buyer pulls the item. The mishna allows a transaction that indicates that one can effect acquisition using only money because that case of the mishna as explained by Rav Naḥman is an uncommon occurrence. It is rare for one who has sold his animal in exchange for money to change his mind and request an animal from the purchaser instead. <b>And</b> it is only <b>with regard to a common matter</b> that <b>the Sages issued a decree,</b> whereas <b>with regard to an uncommon matter, the Sages did not issue a decree.</b> Consequently, the Sages did not apply their decree to this situation.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how is the mishna explained <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish, who</b> disagrees with Rabbi Yoḥanan and <b>says</b> that <b>pulling</b> is <b>explicitly</b> stated <b>in the Torah?</b> Reish Lakish maintains that the acquisition of movable property cannot be performed with money by Torah law, and therefore there can be no distinction between common and uncommon cases. <b>This works out well if</b> Reish Lakish <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Sheshet,</b> who says that produce effects exchange.

            "§ <b>Rava says: A verse and a <i>baraita</i> support</b> the opinion <b>of Reish Lakish</b> that money does not effect acquisition of movable property by Torah law. <b>A verse, as it is written: “And deal falsely with his colleague in a matter of deposit, or of pledge, or of robbery, or oppressed his colleague”</b> (Leviticus 5:21). The verse is referring to cases similar to a deposit where there is denial of an item and not merely a debt.

But with regard to one who reneges on his commitment, the Sages are displeased with him. Apparently, one who reneges is considered to have acted in bad faith.",
            "The Gemara explains: This matter <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 83a): There was <b>an incident involving Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Matya, who said to his son: Go out and hire laborers for us.</b> His son <b>went and allocated sustenance for them,</b> as part of their employment terms, without specifying the type of sustenance. <b>And when he came to his father,</b> his father <b>said to him: My son, even if you prepare for them</b> a meal <b>like the feast of Solomon during his era, you will not fulfill your obligation to them, as they are the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,</b> and due to that status they are deserving of any meal that they want. <b>Rather,</b> this is what you should do: <b>Before they begin</b> engaging <b>in</b> their <b>labor, go out and say to them:</b> Your employment is <b>on the condition that you have</b> the right to claim <b>from me only</b> the customary meal of <b>bread and legumes.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that reneging on <b>a verbal</b> commitment unaccompanied by an act of acquisition <b>constitutes</b> an act of <b>bad faith, how did</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Matya <b>tell</b> his son to <b>renege?</b> The Gemara answers: This is not difficult; it <b>is different there</b> in that case, <b>as the laborers themselves do not rely on</b> the son. <b>What is the reason</b> they do not rely on the son? It is due to the fact that <b>they know that he relied on his father</b> giving his approval when committing to feed them.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> then <b>even</b> if the laborers <b>began</b> engaging <b>in</b> their <b>labor,</b> they still would not rely on the son. Why then did his father instruct him specifically to tell them of the change before they began their labor? The Gemara answers: Once <b>they began</b> engaging <b>in</b> their <b>labor they</b> would <b>certainly rely</b> on the son’s commitment, as <b>they</b> would <b>say: He</b> must have come <b>before his father</b> and <b>stated</b> the conditions of their employment, <b>and</b> his father <b>is amenable</b> to those terms. Therefore, it was necessary to inform them before they began working.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rabbi Yoḥanan say this,</b> i.e., that one who reneges on a verbal commitment acted in bad faith? <b>But didn’t Rabba bar bar Ḥana say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: One who says to another: I am giving you a gift, is able to renege on</b> his commitment? The Gemara asks: <b>He is able to</b> renege?

And if you say</b> that the transaction is nullified only <b>within the time that</b> it takes him <b>to show</b> the merchandise <b>to a merchant or to his relative, what</b> difference <b>is there between</b> a disparity of <b>one-sixth and</b> a disparity of <b>greater than one-sixth?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> a difference, <b>as</b> in the case of a disparity of <b>one-sixth,</b> only the one <b>who was exploited can renege</b> on the transaction, <b>while</b> in the case where the disparity is <b>greater than one-sixth, both can renege</b> on the transaction.",
            "The Gemara returns to discuss the dilemma: <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i>?

            "The Gemara answers: <b>Nullification of the transaction is un-common,</b> and therefore the merchants of Lod did not take that into consideration when calculating which ruling was most advantageous.",
            "The Gemara cites the halakhic resolutions of these dilemmas. <b>Rava said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that if the disparity is <b>less than one-sixth,</b> the <b>merchandise is acquired</b> immediately.

            "<b>Rava said: Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> that <b>taught</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of exploitation with regard to <b>a garment</b> in the <i>mishnayot</i> cited earlier in this chapter? <b>It is Rabbi Shimon,</b> who maintains that even in the case of a <i>sela</i>, the measure of exploitation is one-sixth. <b>Abaye said</b> that the two cases are different: With regard to <b>a garment, a person</b> is likely <b>to waive</b> the disparity <b>up to one-sixth, as people say: Overpay</b> and acquire an item <b>for your back,</b> i.e., a garment, <b>and</b> acquire <b>at cost</b> items <b>for your stomach,</b> i.e., food. Since it is worth purchasing fine garments, the disparity is not significant. By contrast, with regard to the <b><i>sela</i></b> in question, <b>since it does not circulate, he does not waive</b> even the sum of a smaller disparity.",

But if that is the case, Ravina should not cite a proof from the case of the <b>baker, as well;</b> as the baker discussed in the mishna typically <b>purchases</b> his stock of grain <b>from</b> only <b>one person.</b> Therefore, in that case there is no concern that perhaps the customer will tithe from the loaves that he is exempt from tithing for the loaves that he is obligated to tithe.",

Half-shekels were donated by the people during the month of Adar and placed in a special chamber in the Temple, from where, as needed, some of the shekels were taken for use in purchasing public offerings in the coming months. This was done in order to give all of the Jewish people a share in those public offerings.

            "§ The mishna teaches: <b>How so?</b> For example, <b>one acquired wheat from</b> another at the price <b>of</b> one <b><i>kor</i></b> of wheat <b>for</b> one <b>gold dinar,</b> worth twenty-five silver dinars, with the wheat to be supplied at a later date, <b>and such</b> was <b>the</b> market <b>price</b> of wheat at the time he acquired it. The price of a <i>kor</i> of wheat then increased and stood at thirty dinars. At that point, the buyer said to the seller: Give me all of my wheat now, as I wish to sell it and purchase wine with it. The seller said to him: Each <i>kor</i> of your wheat is considered by me to be worth thirty dinars, and you have the right to collect its value in wine from me. And in this case, the seller does not have wine in his possession. The seller is considered to be a borrower with regard to the lender, who is viewed as lending the wheat to the seller. The Gemara asks: <b>And if he does not have</b> any <b>wine, what of it?</b> Why is this factor relevant?",
            "<b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When purchasing produce to be collected by the buyer at a later stage, <b>one may not set</b> a price for <b>produce until the</b> market <b>rate is publicized.</b> If <b>the rate has been publicized, one may set</b> a price, despite the fact that the seller is not actually in possession of any such produce, as <b>even though this</b> seller <b>does not have</b> any of that produce, <b>that</b> one, i.e., another seller, <b>does have</b> some of that produce, which the first seller could purchase at the market rate. Evidently, once the market rate is publicized, the transaction is considered a purchase and not a loan with interest, even if the buyer does not receive the produce immediately.",
            "<b>Rabba said:</b> In <b>the mishna, we are dealing with one who comes to incur a debt for their value,</b> i.e., for the value of the wine. If the borrower, i.e., the seller, possessed wine at that time he would have transferred it to the lender, i.e., the buyer, in place of the wheat, and this could have constituted a proper sale. Since he did not possess any wine, he promised it to the seller at a later date for a higher price, and this constituted a loan with interest as opposed to a sale.",
            "<b>And</b> this is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If</b> a person <b>was owed one hundred dinars by another, and he went and stood by</b> the other’s <b>granary and said</b> to him: <b>Give me my money, as I wish to buy wheat with it.</b> And the debtor <b>said to him: I have wheat</b> in my granary <b>that I will give you; go and calculate for me</b> the amount of wheat to which you are entitled <b>by the current</b> market <b>rate, and I will give you</b> this amount of wheat over the span of <b>a full twelve months,</b> even if the price rises in the interim. Such a practice is <b>forbidden</b> because of interest, <b>as</b> this is <b>not similar to</b> a case where <b>his <i>issar</i> has come into his possession.</b> Since the lender did not give the borrower even a single <i>issar</i> as payment for the wheat, this is not a sale, but a loan with interest.",
            "<b>Abaye said to</b> Rabba: <b>If</b> this transaction is forbidden because <b>it is not similar to</b> a case where <b>his <i>issar</i> has come into his possession, why</b> does the mishna <b>specifically</b> teach the case where <b>he does not have</b> wine? <b>Even if he does have</b> wine, it would <b>also</b> be forbidden, as he gave no money at the time of the acquisition. <b>Rather, Abaye</b> rejected Rabba’s explanation and <b>said: The mishna</b> should be understood <b>like</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>taught by Rav Safra with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>interest,</b> which was taught originally in the <b>school of Rabbi Ḥiyya.</b>",
            "<b>As Rav Safra taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> from the <b>school of Rabbi Ḥiyya with regard to interest: There are matters that are</b> intrinsically <b>permitted</b> by Torah law, <b>but are prohibited because</b> they are <b>artifices</b> used to circumvent transgressing the prohibition of <b>interest. How so?</b> If <b>one said to</b> another: <b>Lend me one hundred dinars,</b> and the other <b>said to him: I do not have one hundred dinars</b> but <b>I have wheat</b> worth <b>one hundred dinars that I will give you,</b> and <b>he gave him wheat</b> worth <b>one hundred dinars, and</b> later he <b>went and acquired</b> the wheat <b>back from him for twenty-four <i>sela</i>,</b> the equivalent of ninety-six dinars, this is <b>permitted</b> by Torah law, as it is considered a double transaction since it included first a loan of the equivalent of one hundred dinars, and then the purchase of the wheat at a discounted rate. <b>But it is prohibited to do so</b> by rabbinic law <b>because</b> this is <b>an artifice</b> allowing the circumvention of transgressing the prohibition <b>of interest.</b>",
            "<b>Here too,</b> the mishna is referring to a case <b>where he said</b> to him: <b>Lend me thirty dinars,</b> and the other <b>said to him: I do not have thirty dinars,</b> but <b>I have wheat</b> worth <b>thirty dinars that I will give you. He</b> then <b>gave him wheat</b> worth <b>thirty dinars, and he</b> subsequently <b>went and acquired</b> the wheat <b>back from him for a gold dinar,</b> which is worth twenty-five dinars.

            "<b>Rava said to</b> Abaye: <b>If so,</b> your explanation does not accord with the wording of the mishna, as the mishna states: <b>Give me my wheat,</b> while according to your interpretation <b>it should have</b> said: Give me <b>the value of my wheat.</b> Abaye responds: Emend the text and <b>teach: The value of my wheat.</b> Rava further asked: The phrase: <b>As I wish to sell it,</b> is also imprecise, as <b>it should have</b> said: <b>Which I sold to you.</b> Abaye again suggests: Emend the text and <b>teach: Which I sold to you.</b> Rava raises yet another difficulty concerning the language of the mishna. The <i>tanna</i> states: <b>Your wheat is considered by me</b> to be worth <b>thirty dinars,</b> but while according to your interpretation <b>he had also established</b> the price <b>for him at this</b> amount <b>at the outset.</b> Abaye answers: <b>This is what he is saying to him:</b> The wine should be collected <b>according to the value of your wheat that you calculated for me at thirty dinars.</b>",
            "Rava continued to question the wording of the mishna.

Rava concludes his explanation: <b>And what is</b> the meaning in the mishna of: <b>Acquired?</b> It means that <b>he acquired</b> it <b>as</b> payment for <b>his loan.</b>",
            "<b>Rava said: Conclude from</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>of Rabbi Oshaya three</b> <i>halakhot</i>: <b>Conclude from it that one may establish</b> repayment of <b>a loan upon produce,</b> meaning that a borrower can promise to pay the lender in produce over the course of a year, based on the market rate at the beginning of the year, <b>and we do not say</b> that this is <b>like</b> a case where <b>his <i>issar</i> has not</b> already <b>come into his possession,</b> as Rabbi Ḥiyya said in the <i>baraita</i> on the previous <i>amud</i>.

If I had money in my hands I would buy</b> the produce myself <b>in</b> the towns of <b>Hini and Shili,</b> nearby market towns, <b>at an inexpensive</b> price. Consequently, the acquisition of produce at the current market rate is of no benefit to him.",
            "<b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: But if that is so,</b> according to this same logic it should be <b>permitted to lend a <i>se’a</i></b> of produce <b>for a <i>se’a</i></b> of the same produce, <b>as</b> the lender <b>can say to</b> the borrower: <b>Your favor is taken and thrown on the thorns, since he says to him:</b> I stand to gain nothing from the <i>se’a</i> you will later give me, as the price of my wheat would increase if it were to remain in my granary, and therefore the loan does not benefit me at all, for will the <b>wheat burn in my warehouse [<i>be’akalbai</i>]?</b> Rav Yosef <b>said to him:</b> The two cases are different, as <b>there</b> it is referring to <b>a loan,</b> and consequently there is a concern about interest, whereas <b>here</b> it is <b>a sale.</b>",
            "<b>Adda bar Abba said to Rava: But</b> with regard to establishing the repayment of the loan upon produce valued at the market rate, the buyer does stand to gain from the agreement, as, if he would have to go to acquire produce elsewhere, <b>he would have to give a dinar to a broker,</b> and therefore he gains a dinar from the early payment. Rava <b>said to him:</b> The case is one <b>where</b> the buyer <b>also gives</b> the seller the broker’s fee. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> There is generally no need to add this fee, as <b>a person’s dinars serve as a broker for him.</b> One who has ready cash has no need for the services of a broker.",
            "§ The Gemara addresses a related issue. <b>Rabba and Rav Yosef both say: One who gives money</b> in advance to purchase produce <b>at the advance price</b> that is in effect shortly after the harvest but before the market price is set <b>must present himself at the granary</b> when the seller is threshing his produce.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>For what</b> reason is he required to be there? <b>If</b> it is in order <b>to acquire</b> the produce, <b>he does not acquire</b> it by merely being present there, as the acquisition is not completed until he pulls the actual produce. And <b>if</b> it is in order for the seller <b>to accept upon himself,</b> in the event that he reneges on the transaction, the curse of: <b>He Who exacted payment</b> from the people of the generation of the flood, and from the people of the generation of the dispersion, will in the future exact payment from whoever does not stand by his statement (see 44a), even <b>if</b> the buyer <b>does not present himself</b> there the seller <b>also accepts upon himself</b> the curse of: <b>He Who exacted payment.</b> This curse is in effect for anyone who reneges on a transaction after the money has been paid.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>Actually,</b> the reason he must go to the granary is for the seller <b>to accept upon himself</b> the curse of: <b>He Who exacted payment,</b> for the following reason: <b>One who gives money</b> in advance to purchase produce <b>at the advance price gives</b> it <b>to two</b> or <b>three</b> different sellers, in order to ensure that he will collect a profit. Consequently, <b>if he presents himself</b> to the seller when he is threshing his produce, the seller <b>relies</b> upon him, as he knows the transaction will proceed. <b>But if</b> the buyer does <b>not</b> present himself to the seller when he is threshing his produce, the seller could <b>say to him: I said</b> to myself <b>that you</b> must have <b>found better produce than mine, and you took</b> that produce. Since the seller is unsure if the transaction will be completed, he may change his mind and sell to a different buyer.",
            "<b>Rav Ashi said: Now that you have said</b> that the reason is <b>due to</b> the seller’s <b>relying</b> upon him, it can be concluded that the buyer does not have to go to the seller’s granary in order to convince him that he intends to uphold the transaction. Rather, <b>even if</b> the buyer <b>finds</b> the seller <b>in the marketplace and says to him</b> that he will not retract his offer to buy the produce, the seller will likewise <b>rely</b> upon him.",
            "§ <b>Rav Naḥman said: The principle with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>interest</b> is: <b>Any payment</b> for <b>his waiting,</b> meaning any additional sum added in consideration of the fact that the lender delays claiming his money, is <b>forbidden.

            "The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <b>obvious?</b> It is clearly interest.

            "The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Naḥman performed an action in the court of the Exilarch in accordance with his statement</b> that even if the lender states his condition after the loan is granted, the lender acquires the entire field if the loan isn’t repaid within the specified time period. The case then came before <b>Rav Yehuda,</b> who <b>tore up</b> the lender’s <b>deed</b> of ownership of the field, claiming it was invalid. <b>The Exilarch said</b> to Rav Naḥman: <b>Rav Yehuda tore up your document,</b> i.e., he overruled your decision. Rav Naḥman <b>said to him:</b> Did <b>a child tear it up?

            "<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> a different version of this exchange, according to which Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: A child tore it up,</b> i.e., there is no need to take his opinion into consideration, <b>as everyone is</b> like <b>a child relative to me with regard to</b> monetary <b>laws.</b> Rav Naḥman was the greatest expert of his generation with regard to monetary matters, and therefore he could discount the opinions of others.",
            "After examining the matter again, <b>Rav Naḥman</b> retracted his words and <b>then said</b> the opposite of his initial ruling: <b>Even</b> if the lender stated his condition <b>at the time of the giving of the money, he has not acquired anything. Rava raised an objection to Rav Naḥman</b> from the mishna, which teaches: If one lent money to another on the basis of the borrower’s field serving as a guarantee, and said to him: <b>If you do not give me</b> the money now and instead delay your payment <b>from now until three years</b> have passed, the field <b>is mine,</b> then after three years, the field <b>is his.</b> Evidently, a condition of this kind is valid.",

By contrast, if the lender encountered the borrower when he <b>was searching for money</b> with which to repay the loan, his agreement does <b>not effect acquisition,</b> as it is clear the borrower made the statement under duress.",

            "<b>Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina:</b> Even in that case, <b>perhaps</b> the borrower <b>thinks</b> that he ought to present himself as particular about the price of his property <b>in order that the</b> price <b>of his</b> other <b>lands not be lowered.</b> If people know that he is in need of money they will pressure to him to lower the price, and therefore he acts as though he is particular about the price, but in reality he did not wish to sell the property at all. <b>Rather, Rav Pappa said</b> that there is a different distinction: <b>If he is particular about</b> any other <b>land</b> he owns and does not want to sell it even at its market rate, he is clearly not suffering from financial problems, and in that case the creditor <b>certainly acquires</b> the field.",
            "<b>And Rav Pappa said: Even though the Sages said</b> that <b>an <i>asmakhta</i> does not effect acquisition,</b> and therefore even if he stipulated that the lender can collect the debt by seizing land, the lender does not acquire that land, nevertheless, the land <b>is</b> considered to be set aside as <b>designated repayment [<i>apoteiki</i>] for</b> the lender <b>to collect</b> repayment <b>from it</b> up to the amount of money owed.",

Consequently, it can be demonstrated that Rav Naḥman holds that mistaken forgiveness is forgiveness. The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>There,</b> the discussion involves <b>a sale,</b> with regard to which it can be said that the seller waived his rights to the fruit. <b>Here,</b> it is referring to <b>a loan,</b> and not requiring the lender to reimburse the borrower for the produce consumed is considered a form of interest.",

            "§ The Gemara discusses other <i>halakhot</i> of mortgages. It is <b>obvious</b> that if the loan was given <b>in a place where they</b> generally <b>remove</b> the lender from the field upon the repayment of the debt, <b>but</b> upon lending the money, the lender <b>said: I will not be removed,</b> his stipulation is respected, <b>as he said that</b> he <b>will not be removed,</b> and he gave him the money only subject to this condition. <b>But</b> if the loan took place <b>in a place where they</b> generally <b>do not remove</b> him, <b>and he said: I will be removed</b> when the money is returned, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>?

            "The Gemara addresses another case. If the borrower <b>said</b> to the lender: <b>I will go to get</b> the <b>money</b> to repay you, the lender <b>may not consume</b> any more of the produce, as this statement is sufficient to remove him from the property. But if he said: <b>I am going to make an effort to get</b> the <b>money,</b> <i>amora’im</i> engaged in a dispute concerning the <i>halakha</i>. <b>Ravina said:</b> The lender <b>may</b> continue to <b>consume</b> the produce until the borrower actually brings the payment, as he cannot be certain the borrower will manage to get the money. <b>And Mar Zutra, son of Rav Mari, said:</b> He <b>may not consume</b> the produce.

            "<b>Mar Zutra said: The explanation</b> for the practice <b>of the one who does consume</b> the produce <b>with a deduction</b> in the amount of the loan is <b>just as it is in</b> the case <b>of an ancestral field,</b> i.e., a field that one inherits from his ancestors within his family holdings in Eretz Yisrael. The Torah states that one who consecrates his ancestral field can redeem it from the Temple treasury in return for one <i>sela</i>, which is four dinars, for each year remaining until the Jubilee (see Leviticus 27:16–19). The comparison is as follows: With regard to <b>an ancestral field,</b> is it <b>not</b> the case that <b>even though he consumes abundant produce</b> over the course of the years, nevertheless, <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah"

            "<b>Rav Ashi said: The elders of</b> the town of <b>Mata Meḥasya told me: An unspecified mortgage [<i>mashkanta</i>]</b> is for <b>a year.</b> The Gemara poses a question: <b>What is the</b> practical <b>difference</b> resulting from this ruling? The Gemara explains: It means <b>that if</b> the lender <b>consumed its</b> produce for <b>a year,</b> the borrower <b>can</b> then <b>remove him; but if not,</b> the borrower <b>cannot</b> yet <b>remove him,</b> as an unspecified mortgage does not last less than this period of time.",

The Gemara answers: It is relevant <b>for the <i>halakha</i> of one</b> whose field <b>borders</b> the field of his neighbor. Since the mortgaged field resides with him, it is considered his property to a certain extent, and therefore he is granted the right to purchase a neighboring field before an outside party does so.",

Rav Pappa would sell liquor and accept delayed payment at a higher price, and believed this to be permitted since he did not gain anything from the arrangement.",
            "What are <b>the documents of Meḥoza?</b> In Meḥoza <b>they would</b> lend money to someone for him to use in a joint business venture, and <b>add the profits to the principal,</b> as though the transaction were already completed, <b>and they would write</b> the full sum owed, including the lender’s share of the profits, <b>in the document.</b> The reason it is prohibited to do this is that <b>who says there will be</b> any <b>profit?</b> It is possible that the borrower will suffer a loss or earn less than expected, and he will eventually be paying interest if he pays the full amount recorded in the document.",
            "<b>Mar, son of Ameimar, said to Rav Ashi: Father would do so,</b> i.e., he would add the profits to the sum of the loan contract, <b>and when they came before him</b> and told him they had not earned enough profit <b>he would believe them</b> and reduce the debt to the amount they had actually earned.

            "The Gemara addresses the final ruling.

            "The Gemara explains: <b>The convert that is mentioned concerning the sale</b> of a Hebrew slave is referring to the following, <b>as it is written: “If your brother waxes poor with you and is sold unto you”</b> (Leviticus 25:39), and it was expounded in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And not</b> only will he be sold <b>to you,</b> a born Jew, <b>but</b> he will be sold even <b>to a convert, as it is stated:</b> “And sells himself <b>to a stranger [<i>leger</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 25:47).",

            "The Gemara explains the <i>baraita</i>. <b>A convert cannot be acquired as a Hebrew slave,</b> as <b>we require</b> the fulfillment of the verse: “Then he shall go out from you, he and his children with him, <b>and shall return to his own family”</b> (Leviticus 25:41), <b>and</b> a convert <b>is not</b> able to do this, since upon conversion the convert severs his relationship with his gentile family, and he therefore has no family.

With regard to <b>a convert as well,</b> it <b>is learned</b> as a tradition: Only one <b>who can be acquired</b> as a Hebrew slave <b>can acquire</b> a Hebrew slave, and one <b>who cannot be acquired</b> as a Hebrew slave <b>cannot acquire</b> a Hebrew slave.

            "The Gemara explains the difference: <b>A Hebrew slave</b> is regarded as <b>discreet in her</b> eyes, and since she trusts that a Hebrew slave will not reveal their actions to others if they engage in sexual intercourse, it is prohibited for her to acquire a male Hebrew slave. By contrast, <b>a Canaanite slave</b> is regarded as <b>indiscreet in her</b> eyes, so she will be deterred from transgressing with him.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> this seems to contradict the <i>baraita</i> <b>that Rav Yosef teaches: A widow may not raise a dog,</b> due to suspicion that she may engage in bestiality, <b>and she may not allow a student</b> of Torah to dwell <b>as a lodger</b> in her home. <b>Granted,</b> it makes sense that it is prohibited for her to have <b>a student</b> of Torah lodging in her home, as he is regarded as <b>discreet in her</b> eyes. <b>But</b> concerning <b>a dog, since it would follow her</b> around afterward if she would engage in bestiality with it, <b>she is afraid</b> to sin with it.

And they also violate the prohibition: “You may lend to a gentile with interest, but <b>to your brother you shall not lend with interest”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:21), as well as: <b>“And you shall not place a stumbling block before the blind”</b> (Leviticus 19:14).

            "<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Those who lend</b> with <b>interest lose more than they gain,</b> as they will eventually be punished by God. <b>Moreover,</b> a loan of this kind desecrates the name of Heaven, <b>as they cause</b> it to seem that <b>Moses our teacher</b> is <b>a scholar and his Torah</b> is <b>true.</b> This is a euphemism; Rabbi Shimon means that their actions make a mockery of Moses and his Torah. <b>And</b> this is because <b>they say: Had Moses our teacher known that there was a profit</b> involved <b>in the matter, he would not have written it</b> as a prohibition.

            "The Gemara explains: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state this <i>halakha</i> <b>where</b> the middleman <b>said to them:</b> The obligation to pay <b>your wages</b> is incumbent <b>upon the employer,</b> and it subsequently became apparent that the employer was not willing to pay that much. In this case the laborers have a grievance only against the laborer who hired them.",
            "The Gemara challenges: <b>But let us see how much laborers are hired for</b> in that place, and the employer should pay them in accordance with the accepted custom. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> in a place <b>where there are</b> those <b>who hire for four</b> dinars <b>and there are</b> others <b>who hire for three.</b> The reason for their grievance is <b>that</b> the laborers can <b>say to</b> the middleman: <b>Had you not told us</b> that you were hiring us <b>for four</b> dinars, we would have <b>made an effort and</b> found another employer, <b>and we</b> would have <b>hired ourselves</b> out <b>for four</b> dinars.

The Gemara responds: This is referring <b>to tilling</b> the land, where the quality of the work is not immediately apparent. The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>tilling as well,</b> doesn’t the employer <b>know</b> what they have done, as he can examine the earth they tilled?

            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution of this dilemma from a <i>halakha</i> concerning a bill of divorce: A woman said to her agent: <b>Bring my bill of divorce for me.</b> Knowing her husband was writing a bill of divorce, she asked the agent to collect the document and transmit it to her. According to the terms of his agency, the wife is divorced only when the document reaches her possession, as he was not appointed as an agent to receive the bill of divorce on her behalf.",
            "<b>But</b> the agent went and told the husband: <b>Your wife said</b> to me: <b>Receive my bill of divorce for me.</b> This statement indicates that the wife had appointed him to receive the bill of divorce in her stead, as an agent of receipt, which would mean that she is divorced as soon as the agent is given the document. <b>And</b> the husband <b>said: Take it in the manner</b> in which my wife <b>said.</b> With regard to this case, <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says</b> that <b>Rav says: Even</b> when <b>the bill of divorce reaches her possession, she is not divorced.</b>",
            "One can <b>learn from this</b> that the husband <b>relies on</b> the agent’s <b>statement.</b> Since the husband was under the mistaken impression that he was interacting with an agent of receipt, he did not instruct him to deliver the document to his wife, and therefore the bill of divorce was not transmitted in the proper manner, which is why she is not divorced at all. <b>As, if it enters your mind that</b> the husband <b>relies on her statement, she should at least be divorced when the bill of divorce reaches her possession,</b> in accordance with the terms of an agent for delivery.

Rather, it is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> by means of his statement <b>the agent negates his agency entirely, as he said to</b> the husband: <b>I am an agent for receipt,</b> meaning: <b>I am not to be</b> an agent <b>for delivery.</b> He is essentially saying that he is not prepared to go to the trouble of delivering the bill of divorce to her. Therefore, even if he does ultimately deliver the bill of divorce to her, he is an agent neither for the woman nor for her husband. No conclusion can be drawn with regard to the question of which statement the husband relies upon.",
            "§ The Gemara had assumed that the term deceived used in the mishna must be referring to an inaccuracy stated by the middleman in his discussion with the laborers.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who gives a down payment to another, and says to him: If I renege, my down payment is forfeited to you, and the other</b> person <b>says to him: If I renege, I will double your down payment for you, the conditions are in effect;</b> i.e., the court will enforce the conditions stipulated between them in this contract.

            "The Gemara comments: <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as he says: A transaction with inconclusive consent [<i>asmakhta</i>] effects acquisition.</b> Even though it is a commitment that he undertook based on his certainty that he would never be forced to fulfill the condition, it is considered a full-fledged commitment.",
            "The Gemara continues its discussion of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: It is sufficient that</b> the down payment <b>effects acquisition</b> of merchandise <b>commensurate with</b> the amount of <b>his down payment.

Evidently, Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel maintains that even if they do not have an explicit contract, the buyer’s first payment finalizes the sale, rendering the remaining payment a standard loan. If so, why does the previous <i>baraita</i> state that Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds that this contract must be in writing?",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult.

Therefore, unless the acquisition was stated in writing, the buyer acquires the entire field only when he pays the entire sum. <b>That</b> ruling, that the down payment effects full acquisition regardless of whether or not it is written in a contract, is stated with regard to a case <b>where he does not go in and go out for money.</b>",
            "This is <b>as Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>one who sells</b> an item <b>to another and</b> then <b>goes in and goes out for money,</b> the buyer <b>has not acquired</b> it, as it is clear that the seller sold it only because he needed the money immediately.

            "The Gemara challenges this proof. <b>From where</b> do you know that this mishna is the source of Rabbi Meir’s opinion with regard to reneging on an agreement made with an employer? <b>Perhaps it is different there, as</b> the dyer <b>acquired</b> the wool <b>by means of</b> the <b>physical change</b> in a substance, and it is for that reason, not due to his divergence from the agreement, that he is comparable to a robber.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the source of the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir</b> is the case <b>of Purim collection. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b>Purim collection,</b> i.e., money collected for the Purim feast for paupers, may be used only <b>for Purim; the city collection,</b> i.e., money collected for poor people of a certain city, is given only <b>for that city.

            "The Gemara refutes this proof: <b>Perhaps there too,</b> this is considered an explicit condition, as it was <b>with the intent</b> that the poor person use it <b>for Purim that he gave him</b> money, but <b>he did not give</b> it to <b>him with the intent</b> that it be used <b>for anything else.</b> Consequently, that is why Rabbi Meir rules stringently in a case of this kind, where the recipient diverged from the intention of the giver.",

            "The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> with regard to Abraham, he prepared <b>three oxen for three people,</b> whereas <b>here,</b> in the case of Solomon, his wives would prepare a feast <b>for the entire</b> realms of <b>Israel and Judah, as it is stated: “Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea</b> in multitude, eating and drinking and making merry” (I Kings 4:20). Abraham’s feast was proportionately greater than that of Solomon.",
            "With regard to the verse cited in relation to King Solomon, the Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the term <b>“fatted fowl [<i>avusim</i>]”? Rav says:</b> It means <b>that they are fed [<i>ovsim</i>] by force. Shmuel says:</b> It means <b>that they were fattened [<i>avusim</i>] and maintained on their own accord,</b> i.e., they were naturally fat. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> Solomon’s feasts were of fine quality because <b>they would bring from his herd an ox that had never been forced</b> to work, <b>and</b> they would also bring <b>a hen from its coop that had never been forced</b> to lay eggs, and use those for the cuisine.",
            "The Gemara cites a related statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The choicest of cattle</b> is the <b>ox. The choicest of fowl</b> is the <b>hen.</b> With regard to the type of hen to which this is referring, <b>Ameimar says:</b> It is <b>a fattened, black hen [<i>zagta</i>] that is found among</b> the wine <b>vats, which</b> consumes so many grape seeds that it <b>cannot take a step</b> the length of <b>a reed,</b> due to its corpulence.",
            "The Gemara returns to discuss the verse in Genesis: <b>“And Abraham ran to the herd,</b> and fetched a calf tender and good” (Genesis 18:7). <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: “A calf”</b> is <b>one; “tender”</b> indicates an additional one, i.e., <b>two; “and good”</b> indicates another one, for a total of <b>three</b> calves. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that the verse is referring to only <b>one</b> calf, <b>as people say</b> when describing a single item that it is <b>tender and good?</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>If so, let</b> the verse <b>write: Tender, good. What</b> is the significance of the term <b>“and good,”</b> which indicates an addition? <b>Conclude from this</b> that the verse is stated <b>for</b> the purpose of <b>an exposition</b> and is referring to more than one calf. The Gemara challenges: But one can still <b>say</b> there were only <b>two</b> calves. The Gemara answers: <b>From</b> the fact that the word <b>“good”</b> is written <b>for an exposition,</b> to include an additional calf, it may be inferred that the term <b>“tender”</b> is <b>also</b> written <b>for an exposition</b> and indicates yet another calf.",
            "<b>Rabba bar Ulla raises an objection, and some say</b> it is <b>Rav Hoshaya, and some say</b> it is <b>Rav Natan, son of Rabbi Hoshaya,</b> who raises the objection: The verse states: <b>“And he gave it to the servant; and he hastened to prepare it”</b> (Genesis 18:7). The singular term “it” indicates that there was only one calf. The Gemara answers: Abraham <b>gave each and every</b> calf <b>to one servant,</b> i.e., he gave the three calves to three different servants. The Gemara raises a question from the verse: <b>“And he took curd, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them”</b> (Genesis 18:8), which again indicates that there was only one calf. The Gemara responds: The verse means <b>that as each calf arrived</b> prepared, <b>he brought it before them,</b> and he did not serve all three calves at once.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And why do I</b> need <b>three</b> calves? <b>One</b> calf <b>should be sufficient</b> for three guests. <b>Rav Ḥanan bar Rava said:</b> Abraham prepared three calves <b>in order to feed</b> the guests <b>three tongues with mustard,</b> a particular delicacy. With regard to this incident, <b>Rabbi Tanḥum bar Ḥanilai says: A person should never deviate from the</b> local <b>custom, as Moses ascended to</b> heaven <b>on high and did not eat bread</b> while he was there, whereas <b>the ministering angels descended down</b> to this world, as guests visiting Abraham, <b>and they ate bread.</b> You say: <b>And they ate</b> bread? Can it <b>enter your mind</b> that they actually ate food? <b>Rather, say</b> that <b>they</b> merely <b>appeared as though they ate and drank.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Every action that Abraham performed himself for the ministering angels, the Holy One, Blessed be He, performed Himself for</b> Abraham’s <b>descendants.

            "The Gemara elaborates: With regard to Abraham, the verse states: <b>“And Abraham ran to the herd”</b> (Genesis 18:7), bringing the meat himself, and in reference to God’s actions for Abraham’s descendants the verse states: <b>“And there went forth a wind from the Lord,</b> and brought across quails from the sea” (Numbers 11:31), that God brought meat to them. In reference to Abraham, the verse states: <b>“And he took curd and milk”</b> (Genesis 18:8), and God says to the Jewish people: <b>“Behold, I will cause to rain bread from heaven for you”</b> (Exodus 16:4), which shows that God gave food to the Jewish people.",
            "With regard to Abraham, the verse states: <b>“And he stood by them under the tree,</b> and they ate” (Genesis 18:8), and in reference to God, the verse states: <b>“Behold, I will stand before you there upon the rock</b> in Horeb; and you shall strike the rock, and there shall come water out of it” (Exodus 17:6). In the case of Abraham it is written: <b>“And Abraham went with them to bring them on the way”</b> (Genesis 18:16), and the verse states: <b>“And the Lord went before them by day”</b> (Exodus 13:21).",
            "By contrast, Abraham performed certain actions through an agent. He said: <b>“Let now a little water be fetched”</b> (Genesis 18:4), and correspondingly the verse states in reference to Moses, God’s messenger: <b>“And you shall strike the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink”</b> (Exodus 17:6).",
            "The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> in stating this, Rav <b>disagrees</b> with <b>that</b> statement <b>of Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina. As Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says, and likewise the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: In reward for three</b> acts of hospitality that Abraham performed for the angels, his descendants <b>merited three</b> rewards. The Gemara elaborates: <b>In reward for</b> providing them with <b>curd and milk,</b> the Jewish people <b>merited the manna; in reward for: “And he stood [<i>omed</i>] by them,”</b> the Jews <b>merited the pillar [<i>amud</i>] of cloud; in reward for</b> Abraham saying: <b>“Let now a little water be fetched,”</b> they <b>merited the well of Miriam.</b> This statement does not distinguish between actions performed by Abraham himself and those performed by means of a messenger.",
            "The Gemara continues its analysis of the verse: <b>“Let now a little water be fetched and wash your feet”</b> (Genesis 18:4). <b>Rabbi Yannai, son of Rabbi Yishmael, said</b> that the guests <b>said to</b> Abraham: <b>Are you suspicious that we are Arabs who bow to the dust of their feet?

            "§ The Gemara expounds another verse involving Abraham: <b>“And the Lord appeared to him by the terebinths of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day”</b> (Genesis 18:1). The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>“the heat of the day”? Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: That day was the third day after Abraham’s circumcision, and the Holy One, Blessed be He, came to inquire</b> about the well-being <b>of Abraham. The Holy One, Blessed be He, removed the sun from its sheath in order not to bother that righteous one with guests,</b> i.e., God made it extremely hot that day to allow Abraham to recover from his circumcision, as he would not be troubled by passing travelers whom he would invite into his tent.",
            "Despite the intense heat, Abraham wanted to invite guests. <b>He sent Eliezer</b> his slave <b>to go outside</b> to see if there were any passersby. Eliezer <b>went out but did not find</b> anyone. Abraham <b>said to him: I do not believe you.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>This</b> demonstrates the popular adage <b>that</b> people <b>there,</b> i.e., in Eretz Yisrael, <b>say: Slaves do not have any credibility.</b> The Gemara continues: Abraham <b>himself went out and saw the Holy One, Blessed be He, standing at the entrance</b> to his tent. <b>This is as it is written:</b> “My Lord, if now I have found favor in your eyes, <b>do not leave Your servant”</b> (Genesis 18:3), i.e., God’s presence was there, and Abraham asked Him for permission to attend to the travelers.",
            "<b>Once</b> God <b>saw</b> Abraham <b>tying and untying</b> the bandage on his circumcision, God <b>said:</b> It is <b>not proper conduct to stand here,</b> i.e., it is not respectful to Abraham even for God to stand there. <b>This is as it is written: “And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, three men stood over him; and when he saw them, he ran to meet them”</b> (Genesis 18:2). The verse first states that they stood over him, and then it says that he ran to meet them. The Gemara reconciles this apparent contradiction: <b>Initially, they came and stood over him. Upon seeing that he was in pain, they said:</b> It is <b>not proper conduct to stand here.</b>",
            "The Gemara continues: <b>Who are these three men?</b> They are the angels <b>Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael: Michael, who came to announce</b> to <b>Sarah</b> that she was to give birth to a son; <b>Raphael, who came to heal Abraham</b> after his circumcision; and <b>Gabriel,</b> who <b>went to overturn Sodom.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But it is written: “And the two angels came to Sodom in the evening”</b> (Genesis 19:1). The Gemara answers <b>that Michael went along with</b> Gabriel to Sodom <b>to save Lot.</b> The Gemara notes: The language <b>is also precise, as it is written: “And he overturned those cities”</b> (Genesis 19:25), <b>and it is not written: They overturned</b> those cities. <b>Conclude from it</b> that only one angel overturned Sodom.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is different with regard to</b> the incident involving <b>Abraham,</b> where the angels acquiesced immediately to his request to remain with him, <b>as it is written: “So do, as you have said”</b> (Genesis 18:5), <b>and what is different with regard to Lot,</b> where they first displayed reluctance, <b>as it is written:</b>"

            "The Gemara continues analyzing the same passage. <b>It is written: “And I will fetch a morsel of bread,</b> and satisfy your heart” (Genesis 18:5), <b>and it is written: “And Abraham ran to the herd,</b> and fetched a calf tender and good” (Genesis 18:7). <b>Rabbi Elazar said: From here</b> we learn <b>that</b> the <b>righteous say little and do much,</b> whereas the <b>wicked say much and do not do even a little.</b>",
            "<b>From where do we</b> derive this principle that the wicked say much and do not do even a little? We derive it <b>from Ephron.

And <b>ultimately it is written: “And Abraham listened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the hearing of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant”</b> (Genesis 23:16), i.e., shekels that could be used in any location. This teaches <b>that</b> not only did Ephron take shekels from Abraham, <b>he took from him only centenaria [<i>kantarei</i>],</b> i.e., superior coins, <b>as there is a place where they call a shekel a centenarius.</b>",
            "The verse states: “Make ready quickly three measures of flour, fine flour” (Genesis 18:6). The Gemara questions the apparent redundancy. <b>It is written: “Flour,” and it is</b> also <b>written: “Fine flour.” Rabbi Yitzḥak says: From here</b> we learn <b>that a woman is more stingy with guests than a man.</b> Sarah wanted to use merely flour, and Abraham persuaded her to use fine flour.",
            "The Gemara continues its analysis of the verses. <b>It is written: “Knead it, and make cakes”</b> (Genesis 18:6), and two verses later <b>it is written: “And he took curd, and milk, and the calf</b> which he prepared” (Genesis 18:8). Abraham served these items to the guests, <b>and yet he did not bring bread before them</b> despite having instructed Sarah to prepare baked goods.",
            "<b>Efrayim Miksha’a, disciple of Rabbi Meir, says in the name of Rabbi Meir: Abraham, our forefather, would eat non-sacred food</b> only when he was <b>in</b> a state of <b>ritual purity,</b> i.e., he treated his food as though it were consecrated to God. <b>And Sarah, our foremother, menstruated that day,</b> which rendered the baked goods ritually impure, preventing Abraham from handling them. Therefore, they could not serve bread to their guests.",
            "The next verse states: <b>“And they said to him: Where is Sarah your wife? And he said: Behold, in the tent”</b> (Genesis 18:9). The Gemara explains that this verse serves <b>to inform</b> us <b>that Sarah, our foremother, was a modest woman,</b> as she remained inside while the guests were present. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says, and some say</b> it is <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak</b> who says: <b>The ministering angels,</b> who visited Abraham in the guise of travelers, <b>knew that Sarah, our foremother, was inside the tent. Rather, what</b> was the purpose of their eliciting Abraham’s response: <b>In the tent?</b> It was <b>in order to endear her to her husband,</b> by accentuating Sarah’s modesty.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says:</b> They inquired about her <b>in order to send her</b> the <b>cup of blessing.</b> It is customary to recite Grace after Meals over a cup of wine, which is then distributed to those present. <b>It is taught in the name of Rabbi Yosei: Why are there dots</b> in the Torah scroll <b>upon the letters <i>alef</i>, <i>yod</i>,</b> and <b><i>vav</i> in</b> the word <b>“to him [<i>eilav</i>]”?</b> These letters spell <i>ayo</i>, which means: Where is he? <b>The Torah is teaching the proper etiquette,</b> which is <b>that a person should inquire of his hostess</b> about his host, just as he should inquire about the welfare of his hostess from the host. The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t Shmuel say: One may not inquire about the welfare of a woman at all,</b> as this is immodest? The Gemara answers: A greeting <b>by means of her husband is different.</b> Asking a husband about his wife is not considered immodest.",
            "The Gemara analyzes the verses that describe Sarah at the time: “And Sarah laughed within herself, saying: <b>After I am waxed old [<i>veloti</i>] shall I have pleasure [<i>edna</i>]”</b> (Genesis 18:12). <b>Rav Ḥisda says: After the skin had worn out [<i>nitballa</i>] and become full of wrinkles, the skin once again became soft [<i>nitadden</i>] and her wrinkles smoothed out, and</b> Sarah’s <b>beauty returned to its place.</b>",
            "<b>It is written</b> that Sarah said: <b>“And my lord is old”</b> (Genesis 18:12), <b>and it is written:</b> “And the Lord said to Abraham: Why did Sarah laugh, saying: Shall I certainly bear a child, <b>and I am old?”</b> (Genesis 18:13). This verse indicates that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, did not repeat</b> to Abraham <b>that</b> which Sarah actually <b>said,</b> that her husband is old.

            "<b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Peace is</b> of such <b>great</b> importance <b>that even the Holy One, Blessed be He, altered</b> the truth for the sake of preserving peace, <b>as it is stated: “And Sarah laughed within herself,</b> saying: After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, <b>and my lord is old,” and it is written: “And the Lord said to Abraham:</b> Why did Sarah laugh, saying: Shall I certainly bear a child, <b>and I am old?”</b>",
            "In reference to Sarah having given birth to Isaac, the verse states: <b>“And she said: Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah should nurse children?”</b> (Genesis 21:7). The Gemara asks: <b>How many children did Sarah nurse?</b> Why does the verse use the plural form when she had only one child? <b>Rabbi Levi says: That day when Abraham weaned his son Isaac, he prepared a great</b> celebratory <b>feast. All of the nations of the world were gossiping and saying</b> to each other: <b>See</b> this <b>old man and old woman who brought a foundling from the market and are saying: He is our son, and moreover they are making a great feast to bolster their claim.</b>",
            "<b>What did Abraham, our forefather, do? He went and invited all of the great</b> men <b>of</b> that <b>generation, and Sarah, our foremother, invited their wives.

            "§ The Gemara continues discussing Abraham: <b>Until Abraham, there was no aging,</b> i.e., old age was not physically recognizable. Consequently, <b>one who wanted to speak to Abraham</b> would mistakenly <b>speak to Isaac,</b> and vice versa: An individual who wanted to speak <b>to Isaac</b> would <b>speak to Abraham,</b> as they were indistinguishable. <b>Abraham came and prayed for mercy, and aging was</b> at last noticeable, <b>as it is stated: “And Abraham was old, well stricken in age”</b> (Genesis 24:1), which is the first time that aging is mentioned in the Bible.",
            "<b>Until Jacob, there was no illness</b> leading up to death; rather, one would die suddenly. <b>Jacob came and prayed for mercy, and illness was</b> brought to the world, allowing one to prepare for his death, <b>as it is stated: “And one said to Joseph: Behold, your father is sick”</b> (Genesis 48:1), which is the first time that sickness preceding death is mentioned in the Bible. <b>Until Elisha, one did not fall ill and</b> then <b>heal,</b> as everyone who fell ill would die. <b>Elisha came and prayed for mercy and he was healed, as it is written: “Now Elisha fell ill with his illness from which he was to die”</b> (II Kings 13:14). <b>By inference,</b> one can derive that <b>he</b> had previously <b>fallen ill</b> with <b>other illnesses</b> from which he did not die.",
            "<b>The Sages taught: Elisha fell ill with three illnesses: One</b> was due to the fact <b>that he pushed Gehazi away with both hands,</b> i.e., he banished Gehazi without granting him a chance to repent (see II Kings, chapter 5). <b>One</b> was due to the fact <b>that he incited bears against young children</b> (see II Kings 2:23–25). <b>And one</b> was the illness <b>from which he died, as it is stated: “Now Elisha fell ill of his illness from which he was to die”</b> (II Kings 13:14).",
            "§ The mishna (83a) teaches that Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Matya said to his son: <b>Rather, before they begin</b> engaging <b>in</b> their <b>labor, go out and say to them:</b> The stipulation that food will be provided is <b>on the condition that you have</b> the right to claim <b>from me only</b> a meal of <b>bread and legumes,</b> which is the typical meal given to laborers. <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Yosef, said to Rav Ḥisda:</b> Did <b>we learn: Bread of legumes [<i>pat kitnit</i>],</b> i.e., inferior-quality bread made of legumes, <b>or</b> did <b>we learn: Bread and legumes [<i>pat vekitnit</i>]?</b> Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: By God!</b> That word <i>vekitnit</i> <b>requires</b> at its beginning the letter <b><i>vav</i></b> as large <b>as an oar [<i>mordeya</i>]</b> made <b>of cypress</b> wood [<i>deliberot</i>], i.e., <i>pat vekitnit</i> is undoubtedly the correct version.",

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters,</b> that a laborer may eat from produce attached to the ground, derived? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “When you come into your neighbor’s vineyard, then you may eat</b> grapes until you have enough at your own pleasure; but you shall not put any in your vessel” (Deuteronomy 23:25). The Gemara asks: <b>We find</b> a source for <b>a vineyard; from where do we</b> derive that a laborer may likewise eat from <b>any</b> other <b>type</b> of produce?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>We derive</b> it <b>from</b> a comparison to the case of <b>a vineyard: Just as a vineyard is unique</b> in that it is <b>an entity whose growth is from the ground, and the laborer eats</b> from <b>it at the time of the completion of</b> its <b>work,</b> i.e., when he is harvesting the grapes, <b>so too</b> with regard to <b>any entity whose growth is from the ground</b> and it is <b>at the time of the completion of</b> its <b>work, a laborer may eat</b> from <b>it.</b>",
            "The Gemara challenges this derivation: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about a vineyard?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> the owner of a vineyard is <b>obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b><i>olelot</i>,</b> the obligation to leave incomplete clusters of grapes for the poor (see Leviticus 19:10). Accordingly, one should not be able to derive the <i>halakha</i> of other types of produce from the <i>halakha</i> of a vineyard. The Gemara explains: <b>We derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> that a laborer may eat from other crops <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> that he may eat <b>standing</b> grain. The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive that he may eat <b>standing</b> grain <b>itself?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “When you come into your neighbor’s standing grain, then you may pluck ears with your hand;</b> but you shall not move a sickle on to your neighbor’s standing grain” (Deuteronomy 23:26).",

Perhaps the Merciful One is discussing any standing</b> produce, not only the five grains from which <i>ḥalla</i> must be separated.",
            "The Gemara answers: The matter <b>is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the term <b>“standing”</b> written here and the term <b>“standing”</b> written elsewhere. <b>It is written here: “When you come into your neighbor’s standing grain”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:26), <b>and it is written there,</b> with regard to harvesting the barley for the <i>omer</i> offering: “Seven weeks you shall count for yourself; <b>from the time the sickle is first put to the standing grain”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:9). <b>Just as there,</b> in the verse referring to the harvesting of the <i>omer</i>, it is the owner of <b>standing</b> grain <b>who is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b><i>ḥalla</i>,</b> as barley is one of the five grains, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to a laborer, it is discussing <b>standing</b> grain <b>whose</b> owner <b>is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b><i>ḥalla</i>.</b>",
            "The Gemara resumes its discussion by reiterating its earlier question.

It is notable <b>in that</b> the owner of dough prepared from grain is <b>obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b><i>ḥalla</i>.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Let</b> the case of <b>a vineyard prove</b> that this comparison is valid, as the mitzva of <i>ḥalla</i> does not apply to the produce of a vineyard, and yet a laborer may eat from it.

            "Since no exact comparison can be drawn to either a vineyard or standing grain alone, the Gemara suggests a combined solution: <b>The inference has reverted</b> to its starting point. <b>The aspect of this</b> case, a vineyard, <b>is not like the aspect of that</b> case, standing grain. <b>Their common denominator is that</b> each one <b>grows from the earth and at the time of the completion of</b> its <b>work</b> the <b>laborer may eat</b> from <b>it.

The <i>baraita</i> continues: The term <b>“then you may eat”</b> indicates that a laborer must eat the entire grape <b>and may not suck</b> its juice and cast the rest away.

            "This interpretation is not tenable, as with regard to the same matter <b>the Merciful One states: “That you may make a difference between the sacred and the non-sacred”</b> (Leviticus 10:10), which indicates that the priest must be capable of making these distinctions when he enters the Temple. <b>Rather, just as there,</b> with regard to the prohibition against drinking wine in the Sanctuary, the Torah means that <b>at the time of entry there must be no drunkenness,</b> whether the wine was drunk inside or outside the Sanctuary, <b>here too</b> it means that <b>at the time of threshing there must be no muzzling.</b>",
            "§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to <b>one who muzzles a cow</b> that someone else is using for threshing, <b>and</b> similarly, <b>one who plows with</b> animals of <b>diverse kinds together,</b> e.g., with an ox and a donkey on the same plow, he is <b>exempt, as only</b> one who <b>threshes</b> a muzzled animal <b>and</b> one <b>who leads</b> diverse kinds of animals together <b>are flogged.</b>",
            "§ <b>It was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disagreed about the following case: If <b>one muzzled</b> an animal <b>with</b> his <b>voice,</b> by berating it whenever it tried to eat, <b>and</b> similarly, if <b>he led</b> diverse kinds of animals together <b>by</b> means of his <b>voice,</b> without performing any action, what is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> he is <b>liable; Reish Lakish says</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> The Gemara explains the reasoning behind their opinions: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> he is <b>liable,</b> as he maintains that <b>the twisting of one’s mouth</b> to speak <b>is</b> considered <b>an action,</b> albeit a slight one, whereas <b>Reish Lakish says</b> he is <b>exempt,</b> because a mere <b>voice is not</b> considered <b>an action.</b>",

        [
            "It is taught at the beginning of tractate <i>Temura</i> that the Torah prohibits the substitution of a non-consecrated animal for a consecrated one. The mishna teaches (<i>Temura</i> 2a): That is <b>not</b> to say <b>that it is permitted for a person to effect substitution; rather</b> it means <b>that if one substituted</b> a non-sacred animal for a consecrated animal, <b>the substitution takes effect.</b> The non-sacred animal becomes consecrated, the consecrated animal remains sacred, <b>and</b> the one who substituted the non-sacred animal <b>incurs the forty</b> lashes. This indicates that one is held liable for mere speech, even without any accompanying action. Reish Lakish <b>said to him:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> that <b>one is flogged for</b> violating <b>a prohibition that does not involve an action.</b> By contrast, the dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis, who maintain that one is punished only for a transgression that includes a full-fledged action.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But can you establish</b> and explain that mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda?</b> After all, <b>it teaches</b> in <b>the first clause: Everyone substitutes</b> a non-sacred animal for a consecrated animal, <b>both men and women.

            "The Gemara elaborates: <b>As, if</b> it were <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, doesn’t he say</b> that <b>an heir cannot effect substitution,</b> and <b>an heir cannot place</b> his hands on the head of an offering? The Gemara refutes this difficulty: This is not a conclusive proof, as it is possible say that <b>this <i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna in <i>Temura</i> <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda <b>with regard to one</b> matter <b>and disagrees with him with regard to one</b> other matter.",
            "§ <b>The Sages taught: One who muzzles a cow and threshes with it is flogged, and</b> in addition <b>he must pay</b> the owner of the cow <b>four <i>kav</i> for a cow,</b> the usual amount it consumes while threshing, <b>and three <i>kav</i> for a donkey.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t</b> there a principle that an offender <b>is not flogged and</b> also punished by <b>death, and</b> likewise <b>he is not flogged and</b> rendered liable to <b>pay?</b> One who transgresses a prohibition is liable to receive only one punishment for a single offense. <b>Abaye said:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> ruling? <b>It is</b> that of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says</b> in general that one can be <b>flogged and</b> be liable to <b>pay.</b>",
            "<b>Rava said</b> that there is a difference between the transgression itself, which is between the offender and God, for which he is liable to be flogged, and the loss he caused the owner of the cow, for which he must pay restitution. The <b>Torah prohibits</b> one from bringing as an offering an animal given as the <b>payment</b> to a prostitute for services rendered (Deuteronomy 23:19); <b>and</b> this prohibition applies <b>even</b> if the man in question <b>engaged in intercourse with his own mother,</b> which is a capital offence. Although this man would certainly not be rendered liable to pay compensation by a court, as he is liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment, nevertheless, since he is technically liable to pay compensation, the money is subject to the prohibition as well. In this case too, despite the fact that the court cannot compel one to pay for the produce his cow ate, he does owe this sum. Furthermore, if the owner of the produce were to seize this sum from him, the court would not force him to return the money.",
            "<b>Rav Pappa stated</b> a different answer: <b>From the time of</b> his <b>pulling</b> of the cow to rent it for threshing <b>he was rendered obligated to</b> provide <b>its sustenance</b> when it threshes, <b>but</b> as <b>for flogging, he is not</b> liable to be <b>flogged until the</b> actual <b>time of muzzling.</b> In other words, he was liable to pay the monetary payment before he incurred liability to receive lashes, which means that they are two separate liabilities.",
            "In relation to the above discussion, <b>Rav Pappa said: These matters,</b> stated below, <b>were raised as a dilemma to me</b> by the members of <b>the house</b> of <b>Rav Pappa bar Abba, and I resolved</b> these matters <b>for them</b> by saying <b>that</b> there is <b>a prohibition</b> in both cases. <b>One</b> of my decisions was <b>in accordance with the <i>halakha</i>, and</b> the other <b>one</b> was <b>not in accordance with the <i>halakha</i>.</b>",

            "<b>And the other question they asked of me</b> was as follows: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>bringing in</b> a male animal and a female animal <b>of different species</b> together <b>into</b> a single <b>pen?</b> Is there a concern that they might mate, which would violate the prohibition against crossbreeding animals? <b>And I resolved</b> it <b>for them</b> by saying <b>that</b> there is <b>a prohibition,</b> but this was <b>not in accordance with the <i>halakha</i>.</b>",
            "<b>As Shmuel says: With regard to adulterers,</b> the witnesses must observe <b>from when they appear as</b> behaving <b>in the manner of adulterers,</b> and they do not need to directly observe the actual moment of the act of intercourse. <b>But</b> with regard to one who crossbreeds two animals <b>of diverse kinds,</b> he is liable only if witnesses attest <b>that he inserted</b> the male organ into the female <b>like a brush into a tube.</b> This clearly shows that crossbreeding is punishable only if performed manually, not if the animals were merely enclosed together.",
            "<b>Rav Aḥadvoi bar Ami raises an objection</b> against this opinion, from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Had</b> the Torah <b>stated</b> merely: <b>“You shall not let your cattle copulate,” I would have said</b> that it is prohibited to assist animals in their mating at all, and consequently <b>a person may not hold the</b> female <b>animal when a male mounts it.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “You shall not let your cattle copulate <b>with a diverse kind”</b> (Leviticus 19:19), which indicates that it is prohibited to mate only different species, but not animals of the same type.",
            "Can one <b>not</b> derive from here <b>by inference that with regard to diverse kinds, holding</b> the animal <b>is also not</b> allowed? This indicates that not only is the act of crossbreeding itself prohibited, but any type of assistance is also prohibited, e.g., restraining the female animal. But if this is the case, placing two animals in the same pen should also be considered a violation. The Gemara refutes this argument: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the term: <b>Holding?</b> It means <b>the insertion</b> of the sexual organ, <b>and why does</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>call it holding?</b> This is <b>a euphemism.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> If one desires to mate an animal of one <b>species with</b> an animal <b>of its</b> own <b>species,</b> it is <b>permitted to insert</b> the male organ into the female <b>like a brush into a tube, and there is not even</b> a concern <b>due to licentiousness</b> and immoral thoughts here. <b>What is the reason</b> for this lenient ruling?

            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the mishna: <b>A laborer may eat cucumbers, and</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> if the amount he eats is equal in value <b>to a dinar;</b> or he may eat <b>dates, and</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> if the amount he eats is equal in value <b>to a dinar.

One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Elazar, <b>holds that “at your own pleasure [<i>kenafshekha</i>],”</b> which literally means: In accordance with your soul, is referring <b>to a matter for which he hands over his soul,</b> i.e., the laborer acquires the fruit by virtue of the risks he accepts upon himself as part of his work.",

To keep a nazirite away from temptation, the Sages attempt to deter him from accepting work in a vineyard by not allowing him to give the fruit to his family.

            "The Gemara suggests another proof: But now <b>state the latter clause</b> of that same mishna: If <b>his cakes,</b> in which he had earlier preserved his figs, <b>broke apart</b> and crumbled, so that they must be preserved once again, or if <b>his barrels</b> of wine <b>opened</b> and he hired laborers to reseal them, <b>these</b> laborers <b>may not eat.</b> The reason is that the figs and wine were already subject to tithes, from which point a laborer may not eat them. <b>And if</b> the owner <b>did not inform them</b> that it is prohibited for them to consume the food, <b>he must tithe</b> the food <b>and feed them.

            "The mishna there continues: If the item was stolen, lost, or broken, or if the animal died in any manner, the <i>halakhot</i> with regard to them are as follows: <b>An unpaid bailee takes an oath over every</b> outcome; whether the item was lost, stolen, or broken, or if the animal died, the unpaid bailee must take an oath that it happened as he described, and he is then exempt from payment. <b>And the borrower</b> does not take an oath, but <b>pays</b> for <b>every</b> outcome, whether it was stolen or lost, even in a circumstance beyond his control. The <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a paid bailee and a renter</b> are the same: They <b>take an oath over an injured</b> animal, <b>over a captured</b> animal, <b>and over a dead</b> animal, attesting that the mishaps were caused by circumstances beyond their control, and they are exempt; <b>but they must pay</b> for <b>loss or theft.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verses in the Torah about bailees can be divided into three passages. The <b>first passage</b> (Exodus 22:6–8) <b>is stated about an unpaid bailee;</b> the <b>second</b> (Exodus 22:9–12) is <b>about a paid bailee;</b> and the <b>third</b> (Exodus 22:13–14) is <b>about a borrower.</b>",

            "The Gemara justifies the claim of the <i>baraita</i>: Clearly a paid bailee carries a more severe level of liability that an unpaid bailee. Accordingly, <b>it stands to reason</b> that the <b>second</b> passage is <b>about a paid bailee, as</b> it states a stringency, that the bailee is <b>liable</b> even <b>in</b> cases of <b>theft or loss</b> (see Exodus 22:11). The Gemara challenges this claim: <b>On the contrary,</b> it stands to reason that the <b>first</b> passage is <b>about a paid bailee, as</b> it states a stringency, that the bailee <b>pays</b> the <b>double payment in</b> a case where he takes a false oath <b>stating the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the item he was safeguarding (see Exodus 22:6).",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>Even so,</b> being liable to pay <b>the principal</b> whenever one claims the deposit was stolen, <b>without</b> the ability to exempt oneself by taking <b>an oath, is a greater</b> stringency <b>than</b> being liable for <b>the double payment,</b> as that liability is only <b>when</b> one takes a false <b>oath</b> to that effect. Otherwise, he is exempt.",
            "The Gemara adds: <b>Know</b> that this is so, <b>as a borrower</b> bears the most severe level of liability, because he is privileged. <b>All benefit</b> from the transaction <b>is his,</b> without incurring any cost to himself. <b>And</b> in cases of theft <b>he pays only</b> the <b>principal</b> but is never required to pay the double payment.",
            "The Gemara questions the proof just cited: <b>But</b> is it true that with regard to <b>the borrower all benefit</b> from the transaction <b>is his?

            "<b>Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> that a borrower who also borrowed the services of the owner is exempt if the animal is injured or dies is derived as follows: <b>From where did we</b> originally derive <b>the liability of a borrower in</b> a case of <b>theft or loss?

Rather, the liability of the borrower depends on whether or not the owner was working for the borrower when he entrusted the borrower with his animal.",
            "<b>But if you say</b> that <b>the first clause and the latter clause</b> both pertain to a case where the owner is engaged <b>in</b> the <b>same work</b> as his animal, <b>what is the novelty</b> of mentioning what type of work he did? Both <b>this</b> clause <b>and that</b> clause concern similar cases, in which the owner is engaged <b>in</b> the <b>same work</b> as his animal. It is therefore apparent that the clauses concern different cases. The first clause teaches that the borrower is exempt even in a case where the owner was engaged in different work than his animal. The first part of Rav Hamnuna’s ruling, that the owner needs to be engaged in the same work as his animal, is thereby refuted.",
            "<b>And furthermore,</b> even the second part of Rav Hamnuna’s ruling, that the exemption applies only when the owner was working for the borrower from the time of the borrowing of the animal until the time of the mishap, can be refuted, as <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From the implication of that which is stated: “If its owner is with him, he does not pay”</b> (Exodus 22:14), <b>do I not</b> already <b>know</b> what is stated in the next verse, <b>that “if its owner is not with him, he shall pay”</b> (Exodus 22:13)? <b>Rather, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Its owner is not with him”?</b> It serves <b>to tell you:</b> If <b>he was with him,</b> i.e., working for him, <b>at</b> the <b>time of borrowing, he does not need to be with him at</b> the <b>time when</b> the animal is <b>injured or dies</b> for the exemption from liability to apply; but if he <b>was with him at</b> the <b>time when</b> the animal is <b>injured or dies, he</b> does <b>need to have been with him at</b> the <b>time of borrowing</b> for the exemption from liability to apply.",
            "<b>And it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>From the implication of that which is stated: “If its owner is not with him, he shall pay,” do I not</b> already <b>know</b> what is stated in the preceding verse, <b>that “if its owner is with him, he does not pay”?

            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that the following <i>baraita</i> <b>supports</b> this opinion of Rav: One said to another: <b>Lend me your cow.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> if that is the case addressed in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> this <i>halakha</i>? It is obvious.

This results in a smaller payment, as the damage appears less significant in the context of a larger area. In this case as well, the value of the entire cake is evaluated, not what it would be worth were one to divide it into smaller units.",

It is apparent from this statement of Shmuel that the <i>halakhot</i> of compensating a common person are similar to and can be derived from those of the Temple treasury.

As Rava says:</b> Using <b>consecrated</b> property <b>without</b> the Temple treasurer’s <b>knowledge is like</b> using property belonging to <b>a common person with</b> his <b>knowledge.</b> Since, ultimately, the true owner of consecrated property is God, benefit from it is always considered to be have been derived with the owner’s knowledge. Consequently, one cannot derive an inference from the <i>halakha</i> of deriving benefit from consecrated property to a case of deriving benefit from a common person’s property without his knowledge. Accordingly, it is more reasonable that Shmuel retracted his ruling about residing in another’s courtyard.",
            "The Gemara cites another ruling concerning differing rates of compensation: <b>Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>these porters who broke a shopkeeper’s barrel of wine,</b> which <b>on market day sells for five</b> dinars <b>and on other days sells for four</b> dinars, if they <b>restore</b> its value <b>to him on market day,</b> then it is sufficient if <b>they compensate him</b> with <b>a barrel of wine,</b> which he could then sell for five dinars.

Consequently, there should be no requirement to take an oath. To resolve this difficulty, <b>Rava said:</b> In the case of <b>the slave,</b> the mishna is referring to a case <b>where,</b> after the sale, the seller <b>severed</b> the slave’s <b>hand, and</b> in the case of the <b>field,</b> it is a case <b>where,</b> after the sale, the seller <b>dug pits, ditches and caves in it,</b> and therefore he cannot say: Here you are.",
            "The Gemara offers another challenge to Rav Sheshet’s interpretation: <b>But didn’t Rabbi Meir teach us the opposite? As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Kamma</i> 96b): If one <b>robbed</b> another of <b>an animal and it aged</b> and declined in value while in his possession, or if one robbed another of Canaanite <b>slaves and they aged,</b> since they are no longer in the condition that they were in when he robbed them, he cannot return them in their current state to his victim; rather, <b>he pays according to</b> their value at <b>the time of the robbery. Rabbi Meir says: With regard to slaves, he says to</b> the victim: <b>That which is yours is before you</b> and no compensation is required. Apparently, Rabbi Meir holds that the legal status of a slave is like that of land, and not, as Rav Sheshet said, like that of movable property.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> is <b>not difficult.</b> Rav Sheshet apparently holds <b>like Rabba bar Avuh, who reverses</b> the attribution of the opinions in that mishna <b>and teaches: Rabbi Meir says: He pays according to</b> their value <b>at the time of the robbery. And the Rabbis say: With regard to slaves, he says to</b> the victim: <b>That which is yours is before you</b> and no compensation is required.",
            "Since Rav Sheshet interprets the mishna as referring to a case where the dispute is over the slave alone and interprets it to be in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir, he apparently also assumes that Rabbi Meir holds that an oath is taken even with regard to a claim of land, as his explanation would need to account for the case in the mishna concerning a dispute over the small or large field. The Gemara questions this assumption: <b>But</b> given that Rabbi Meir said only that the legal status of a slave is like that of movable property, <b>from where</b> does Rav Sheshet learn <b>that Rabbi Meir holds that we compare land to a slave,</b> so that <b>just as</b> for a claim about <b>a slave, an oath is taken, so too,</b> for a claim about <b>land, an oath is taken? Perhaps</b> Rabbi Meir holds that <b>an oath is taken</b> only <b>on</b> a claim about <b>a slave but not on</b> a claim about <b>land.</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: It should <b>not enter your mind</b> that Rabbi Meir makes a distinction between slaves and land in this regard, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who exchanges a cow for a donkey,</b> such that by virtue of the cow owner’s act of acquisition on the donkey, the donkey’s erstwhile owner simultaneously acquires the cow, wherever it happens to be located, <b>and</b> afterward the cow is found to have <b>calved; and similarly,</b> with regard to <b>one who sells his</b> Canaanite <b>maidservant,</b> with the acquisition effected by the buyer giving him money, <b>and</b> afterward <b>she</b> is found to have <b>given birth</b> to a child, who will be a slave belonging to his mother’s master, at times it is uncertain whether the offspring was born before or after the transaction.",
            "If <b>this</b> seller <b>says:</b> The birth occurred while the cow or maidservant was still <b>in my possession, and that</b> buyer <b>remains silent,</b> the seller is <b>entitled</b> to take the offspring.",
            "If <b>this</b> one <b>says: I do not know</b> what happened, <b>and that</b> one <b>says: I do not know</b> what happened, <b>they divide</b> the value of the offspring between them.",
            "If <b>this</b> seller <b>says:</b> The birth occurred while the cow or maidservant was still <b>in my possession, and that</b> buyer <b>says:</b> The birth occurred after the cow or maidservant was already <b>in my possession,</b> then <b>the seller takes an oath</b> stating <b>that</b> the cow or maidservant <b>gave birth in his possession</b> and he is then entitled to take the offspring. This is <b>because</b> for <b>anyone who takes an oath</b> required <b>by Torah law,</b> he <b>takes</b> the <b>oath and does not</b> have to <b>pay.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: One does not take an oath, not on</b> a claim concerning <b>slaves and not on</b> a claim concerning <b>land.</b>",
            "The Gemara explains its proof from this <i>baraita</i>: Since the Rabbis replied to Rabbi Meir that an oath is not taken on a claim concerning slaves or land, <b>is it not</b> correct that <b>by inference, Rabbi Meir holds</b> that one can <b>take an oath</b> on a claim concerning either slaves or land?",
            "The Gemara rejects this inference: But <b>from where</b> is this inferred? <b>Perhaps</b> the Rabbis <b>are speaking to him</b> utilizing the style of: <b>Just as,</b> and they are saying as follows: <b>Just as you concede to us with regard to land, concede to us also with regard to slaves.</b>",
            "The Gemara adds: <b>Know</b> that Rabbi Meir holds that one does not take an oath for a claim concerning land, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shevuot</i> 42b): <b>Rabbi Meir says: There are</b> some <b>matters that</b> have a legal status <b>like</b> that of <b>land, but</b> nevertheless, with regard to oaths <b>they are not</b> treated <b>like land</b> and so one takes an oath with regard to them. <b>But the Rabbis do not concede</b> to Rabbi Meir that this is the <i>halakha</i>. <b>How so?</b> If one claims: <b>I delivered ten vines laden</b> with grapes <b>to you, and the other says: There were only five; Rabbi Meir deems him liable</b> to take an oath of one who admits to part of a claim. <b>But the Rabbis say: Anything that is attached to the ground has</b> a legal status <b>like</b> that of <b>land,</b> so no oath is taken with regard to them.",
            "The Gemara clarifies the scope of the dispute: <b>And Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina says:</b> The difference <b>between them</b> is only in a case of <b>grapes that are ready to be picked, as</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>holds: They are considered as</b> though they were already <b>harvested,</b> meaning that they are regarded as movable property, with regard to which an oath is taken. <b>And</b> the other <b>Sage,</b> the Rabbis, <b>holds: They are not considered as</b> though they were about to be <b>picked,</b> meaning that they are regarded as land, with regard to which an oath is not taken. Evidently, Rabbi Meir agrees that an oath is not taken concerning land.",
            "<b>Rather, actually</b> the mishna can be explained only <b>in accordance with</b> the interpretation <b>of Rabbi Hoshaya,</b> cited above. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>that which posed a difficulty to you,</b> namely that according to his explanation, the novelty of the mishna is only that movable property <b>binds</b> land so that one can be required to take an oath with regard to it, and that <i>halakha</i> is already taught in the mishna in tractate <i>Kiddushin</i>, one can explain that it <b>was necessary</b> to also teach this in the mishna here, because it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that the <b>garment of a slave is like</b> the <b>slave</b> himself, or that <b>sheaves of a field are like</b> the <b>field</b> itself. If so, there would be no basis to require an oath, even one based on the claims about the garment and sheaves themselves. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that they are considered distinct items and the claims concerning them require the seller to take an oath which can then be extended to require an oath for the claim concerning the slave or land.",
            "§ The Gemara analyzes one of the clauses of the <i>baraita</i> cited above: In a case in which it is unclear when the cow or maidservant gave birth, if <b>this</b> one <b>says: I do not know</b> what happened, <b>and that</b> one <b>says: I do not know</b> what happened, <b>they divide</b> the value of the offspring between them.

            "The Gemara questions this attribution: If so, <b>say</b> and try to explain accordingly <b>the latter clause</b> of that <i>baraita</i>: If <b>this</b> seller <b>says:</b> The birth occurred while the cow or maidservant was still <b>in my possession, and that</b> buyer <b>says:</b> The birth occurred after the cow or maidservant was already <b>in my possession,</b> then <b>the seller takes an oath</b> stating <b>that it gave birth in his possession,</b> and he is then entitled to take the offspring.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>Sumakhos concedes</b> that <b>where there is</b> a requirement for one of the parties to take <b>an oath</b> required <b>by Torah law,</b> that the disputed amount is not divided.

            "Initially, when the Sages studied this mishna, <b>they assumed</b> the following interpretation: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>A field of his ancestors?</b> It is a reference to any field in <b>Eretz Yisrael. And why did they call it: A field of his ancestors?</b> Because it is <b>a field of</b> his forefathers, <b>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</b>",
            "According to this interpretation, the mishna is referring to a field which was legitimately acquired by the gentile and to which the Jew has no claim. The Gemara explains why the Jewish sharecropper is required to tithe the produce he will give the landowner: <b>And</b> the reason the sharecropper tithes that produce is that the <i>tanna</i> <b>holds</b> that <b>a gentile’s acquisition</b> of land <b>in Eretz Yisrael does not abrogate</b> its sanctity <b>with regard to</b> separating <b>tithes</b> from its produce.",
            "<b>And</b> Rabbi Yehuda also holds that the obligation of one who <b>receives</b> a field of his ancestors, i.e., a sharecropper, to pay the landowner <b>is like</b> that of <b>a tenant farmer,</b> i.e., <b>just as a tenant farmer, whether</b> the field <b>produces</b> a crop <b>or whether it does not produce</b> a crop, <b>is required to</b> procure produce from somewhere, <b>tithe</b> it, <b>and</b> then <b>give</b> it <b>to</b> the landowner, <b>as he is like one paying his debt, so too,</b> one who <b>receives,</b> i.e., a sharecropper, is <b>also</b> is <b>like one paying his debt,</b> and he must consequently first <b>tithe</b> the produce <b>and</b> then <b>give</b> it <b>to</b> the landowner. Since his obligation to the landowner is regarded as a debt, apparently before the produce is given to the landowner, it belongs to the tenant farmer or sharecropper, who is therefore required to tithe it.",
            "<b>Rav Kahana said to Rav Pappi, and some say</b> that he said it <b>to Rav Zevid: But</b> this explanation is challenged by <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that <b>one who receives a field of his ancestors</b> under a sharecropping agreement, <b>from a gentile oppressor</b> who seized it, first <b>tithes</b> produce <b>and</b> then <b>gives</b> the gentile his portion. According to the Sages’ initial understanding, <b>why</b> does the <i>baraita</i> <b>specifically</b> refer to <b>an oppressor</b> who stole the land? <b>Even</b> if the gentile was <b>not an oppressor,</b> the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> would <b>also</b> apply.",

Therefore, fundamentally the sharecropper should not have to tithe the produce before giving it to the landowner. The requirement to do so is a fine the Sages imposed upon him, as the Gemara will explain.",
            "<b>And,</b> according to this explanation, <b>what</b> is the meaning of: <b>A field of his ancestors?</b> It is referring to <b>a field</b> that belonged to <b>his actual ancestors,</b> of whom he is their heir, and it was then seized by a gentile. <b>And it is</b> only <b>him whom the Sages penalized</b> and required to take tithes from produce before giving it to the gentile oppressor, <b>as, since</b> the land <b>is dear to him, he will more readily go and receive it</b> in a sharecropping arrangement from the gentile, despite the Sages’ requirement. <b>But</b> with regard to another <b>person of the world</b> at large, the Sages did <b>not</b> penalize him, as no one else would be willing to receive the land under such disadvantageous terms.",

Since alternative housing is not available, even if he is renting the house month by month, one cannot evict him.",
            "The Gemara asks: If that is the reason for the first clause of the mishna, <b>say</b> and try to explain accordingly <b>the latter clause</b> that states: <b>And</b> for a house located <b>in the cities, both in the summer and in the rainy season,</b> one must give <b>twelve months’</b> notice. It arises from this ruling that <b>if</b> the twelve month <b>rental period would be completed during the rainy season, he could evict him</b> then. <b>But why</b> is this acceptable, given that <b>houses for renting are not found</b> on the market at that time?",
            "Given this difficulty, the Gemara offers a different interpretation of the mishna: <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> The mishna <b>teaches</b> about the requirement <b>to give notice</b> before eviction, <b>and this</b> is what it <b>is saying:</b> Although in general in a case of <b>one who rents out a house to another without specification</b> of when the rental period will end, both the landlord and the renter can end the rental whenever they so decide, the landlord cannot <b>evict</b> the renter <b>during the rainy season,</b> i.e., <b>from the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i> <b>until Passover, unless he gives him notice</b> of <b>thirty days from the outset,</b> i.e., before the rainy season begins. Since it would still be summer, it would be possible for the renter to find alternate housing. But if a fixed rental period was agreed upon, the renter may be evicted upon its completion without prior notice.",
            "<b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>When they said,</b> in the mishna: <b>Thirty days, and when they said: Twelve months, they said it only</b> with regard to the requirement <b>to give notice</b> before eviction. <b>And just as a landlord needs to give notice</b> to his renter before he evicts him, <b>so too a renter needs to give notice</b> to his landlord before he can terminate the rental. The Gemara explains why the renter must give notice: <b>As</b> the landlord <b>can say to him: Had you given me notice, I would have exerted myself</b> to find <b>and settle a respectable person in</b> my house.",
            "<b>Rav Asi says: If one day</b> of the rental <b>enters into the rainy season</b> without notice being given, then the landlord <b>cannot evict</b> the renter <b>from the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i> <b>until Passover.</b> The Gemara challenges this: <b>But didn’t we say</b> that he must be given <b>thirty days’</b> notice? Rav Asi’s ruling indicates that if notice was given even a day before <i>Sukkot</i>, that would be sufficient. The Gemara explains: <b>This</b> is what Rav Asi <b>is saying: If one day of these thirty days</b> of notice <b>enters into the rainy season</b> without notice being given, i.e., if notice was given fewer than thirty days before <i>Sukkot</i>, then the landlord <b>cannot evict</b> the renter <b>from the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i> <b>until Passover.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Huna said: And if</b> the landlord <b>comes to increase</b> the rental <b>fee, he may increase</b> it without prior notice. <b>Rav Naḥman said to him:</b> One who does so is like <b>this</b> person <b>who grabbed</b> another <b>by his testicles so that he would relinquish his cloak,</b> i.e., he has not provided the person with a true choice. By increasing the rent, one is effectively evicting him and so he should have to give thirty days’ notice. The Gemara defends Rav Huna’s opinion: <b>No,</b> the ruling is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where</b> the rental of <b>houses became more expensive.</b> Since the landlord would lose out by preserving the rent, it is acceptable for him to increase the rent without prior notice.",
            "§ It is <b>obvious</b> that if <b>the house</b> in which the landlord lives <b>fell down,</b> then he can evict his renter from the house that he is renting to him, without giving notice, as <b>he can say to him: You are no better than me.</b> Since the landlord needs to find a new house to live in, he can demand that he should move into his rental property and it should be his renter who must look for new housing. He cannot be expected to have given notice, as he could not have foreseen that his house would fall down.",
            "If a landlord <b>sold</b> the rental property to another, <b>or bequeathed it</b> to his heirs, <b>or gave it</b> to another person <b>as a gift,</b> the renter <b>can say to</b> the new owner: <b>You are no better than the person from whom your</b> ownership of the property <b>came.</b> Since he was required to give me notice before evicting me, so must you.",
            "If a landlord <b>marries off his son,</b> and wishes to evict his current renter to provide a home for the newly married couple, then <b>we see: If it was possible for him to have given notice,</b> as the couple had already been engaged for some time, <b>then he is required to give notice</b> and cannot evict his renter otherwise, <b>but if</b> it was <b>not</b> possible to give timely notice, then <b>he can say</b> to his renter: <b>You are no better than me</b> and my needs.

            "The Gemara explains: <b>There,</b> in the case of the grain, Shmuel’s ruling was not due to the fact that we attend to the final expression, since it is uncertain whether or not we do. Rather, <b>what is the reason</b> for his ruling? It is <b>due to</b> the fact that the buyer <b>has</b> already <b>taken hold</b> of the grain and consequently has presumptive ownership of it. <b>Here too,</b> in the case of the bathhouse, each party <b>is holding</b> onto the basis of his claim, i.e., the landlord has possession of his property and the renter has possession of his money, and it is only due to this reason that Shmuel rules as he does.",

The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Rav Naḥman <b>teaching us?</b> Could his ruling be based on saying that one should <b>attend</b> only to <b>the last statement?</b> But then <b>this is</b> identical to the ruling <b>of Rav.</b> The Gemara clarifies: Rav Naḥman’s ruling is unlike Rav’s, as Rav Naḥman would award the extra month to the landlord <b>even where</b> the order of the two expressions <b>is reversed.</b> Rather, as he explained, his ruling is based on the fact the landlord has possession of the property.",
            "§ The Sages <b>raised a dilemma before Rabbi Yannai:</b> If <b>a renter says</b> to his landlord: <b>I</b> already <b>gave</b> the rental fee to you, <b>and</b> the <b>landlord says: I did not take</b> any payment from you, <b>upon whom is the burden of proof?</b>",
            "The Gemara clarifies the dilemma: <b>When</b> did the renter make his claim? <b>If</b> it was <b>during his</b> rental <b>period, we</b> already <b>learned</b> the <i>halakha</i> in this case and the Sages would not have asked about it. Similarly, <b>if</b> it was <b>after his</b> rental <b>period, we</b> already <b>learned</b> the <i>halakha</i> in that case as well. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bekhorot</i> 49a): A father is obligated to redeem his firstborn son after the son is thirty days old by paying five shekels to a priest. If <b>the father died within thirty days</b> of the birth, the son <b>has the presumptive status of being unredeemed, until he brings a proof that he was redeemed.</b> If he died <b>after thirty days,</b> the son <b>has the presumptive status of having been redeemed, until</b> people <b>tell him that he was not redeemed.</b> It is apparent from this mishna that a person is presumed not to pay money before he must, and he is presumed to have paid money once he is required to do so. This logic can be applied to the paying of a rental fee.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to raise the dilemma in a case where the renter makes his claim <b>on the day on which his</b> rental <b>period is completed.</b> The dilemma is <b>whether a person is apt to pay</b> his debts <b>on the</b> very <b>day on which</b> the <b>period</b> in which to pay them <b>is completed, or</b> he is <b>not.</b>",

So too, in the case of rent, if the landlord demands payment, and the renter claims to have paid, the landlord should be able to take an oath and then take the payment.",
            "The Gemara explains: Generally, one takes an oath to exempt oneself from paying, not to collect. And it is specifically in the case of <b>a hired laborer that the Sages imposed an oath upon him, due to the fact that the employer is busy with his workers</b> and might mistakenly think he paid a particular worker when in fact he had paid a different one. <b>But here,</b> in the case of rent, where there is no such concern, the <b>renter is deemed credible that he already paid the rent,</b> provided <b>that</b> he takes <b>an oath.</b>",

            "<b>Hillel the Elder said to</b> the children who came before him for a ruling on their status: <b>Bring me your mother’s marriage contract</b> for examination. <b>They brought him their mother’s marriage contract, and he found that</b> the following formulation <b>was written in it: When you will enter the wedding canopy, be for me a wife.</b> This shows that the marriage would not take effect at the time of her betrothal, but only after she would enter the wedding canopy. Consequently, the marriage did not occur at all, as she never entered the wedding canopy, <b>and</b> therefore these women <b>did not cause their children</b> to be <b><i>mamzerim</i></b> by engaging in intercourse with the other man.",
            "The Gemara adds: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa would</b> also <b>expound common language. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa says:</b> One <b>who lends</b> money to <b>another may not take more collateral from him than</b> the value of <b>his debt, as this</b> is what the debtor <b>writes to</b> the creditor if the creditor temporarily returns a deposit for the debtor’s use: <b>The payment</b> to <b>which you have</b> a right, which it is <b>upon me</b> to pay, <b>corresponds to the entire</b> value of <b>this</b> item, indicating that the item cannot be greater in value than the debt itself.",

            "The Gemara relates: The Sages of <b>Neharbela collected,</b> i.e., allowed the wife to collect, <b>one-third</b> of the stated sum, as the custom in their location was to write three times the actual amount of the dowry in the marriage contract. <b>Mareimar</b> would allow the wife to <b>collect even the added value</b> of those sums that the father of the bride had written in the marriage contract in honor of his daughter.",
            "<b>Ravina said to Mareimar: But isn’t it taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that in a location where the custom is <b>to</b> record <b>double</b> the amount, she <b>collects</b> only <b>half?</b> The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult;</b> in <b>this</b> case, where Mareimar allowed the wife to collect the full sum, the husband <b>performed</b> an act of <b>acquisition</b> for the entire written amount <b>with</b> the father of the bride; whereas in <b>that</b> case, where the <i>baraita</i> rules that she collects only a portion of the sum written for the dowry, the husband <b>did not perform</b> an act of <b>acquisition</b> for the entire written amount <b>with</b> the father of the bride. Therefore, the wife would collect the sum of her dowry only in accordance with the regular custom.",

            "The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> that <b>is not so.</b> There <b>is no difference whether he said: For her marriage contract, and</b> there <b>is no difference whether he said: In her marriage contract.</b> In either case her dowry is written as <b>four hundred dinars, which are two hundred</b> in practice, <b>unless he</b> simply <b>said: Give her, without specification,</b> i.e., without mentioning the marriage contract.

            "§ A common type of business venture was one where the capital or merchandise was supplied by one person and managed by another, who would receive a share, commonly half of the profits, for his efforts. This arrangement can also be viewed as one where the investor is lending half of the invested capital or merchandise to the manager, with the manager agreeing to supervise the venture in exchange for receiving the loan. In order to avoid violating the prohibition of interest, the investor agrees to accept a greater share of the possible loss, e.g., two-thirds, than of the profits, e.g., one-half. The Sages <b>of Neharde’a said:</b> With regard to its halakhic status, <b>this joint venture</b> is considered <b>a half-loan and half-deposit,</b> as the <b>Sages formulated</b> an <b>enactment that</b> would be <b>satisfactory for the borrower,</b> i.e., the manager, <b>and</b> equally <b>satisfactory for the lender,</b> i.e., the investor.",
            "<b>Now that we have said</b> that <b>half</b> of the capital is viewed as <b>a loan,</b> it would appear that the manager may use the money in any way he chooses: <b>If</b> he <b>wants to drink alcohol with it,</b> he may <b>well</b> do so, regardless of any objection on the part of the investor. <b>Rava</b> disagreed and <b>said:</b> It is <b>for this</b> reason that <b>it is called a joint venture, as</b> the investor can <b>say to</b> the manager: <b>When I gave</b> the money <b>to you</b> it was <b>to use it</b> for business <b>and not to drink alcohol with it.</b>",

            "In any case, it is evident that Rav approves of one whose property is located near a city. How does this accord with his statement that there is concern for the evil eye when one’s field is viewed by people? The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult.

            "<b>Abaye said: We learn</b> a similar <i>halakha</i> in the mishna (<i>Bava Batra</i> 24b) <b>as well,</b> with regard to a tree planted adjacent to a city. Such a tree must be chopped down in any event, regardless of what preceded what. If the city preceded the tree, the owner is not entitled to compensation, but if the tree was there first, he receives payment for the tree. If it is <b>uncertain</b> whether <b>this</b> one was <b>first</b> or <b>that</b> one was <b>first,</b> the owner of the tree <b>cuts it down and</b> the people of the city <b>do not give money</b> to the owner.",
            "<b>Apparently, since</b> this tree is <b>standing to be chopped down,</b> as it is chopped down regardless of whether it or the town was there first, <b>we say to</b> the owner of the tree: You must <b>bring proof</b> to support your claim that the tree was there before the town <b>and</b> only then you may <b>take</b> its value, although the tree is currently in his possession and has not yet been cut down. <b>So too,</b> with regard to <b>this document</b> recording the lien on the land, <b>since it</b> is <b>ready for collection,</b> it is <b>considered as though it has been collected and</b> the responsibility falls <b>upon the orphans to bring proof.</b>",
            "In the case where <b>the orphans brought proof that they</b> indeed <b>enhanced</b> the land, <b>Rabbi Ḥanina thought to say: When we remove them, we remove them by</b> giving them part of <b>the land</b> equivalent to the value of their enhancement.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>But</b> that <b>is not</b> so, as <b>we remove them</b> by paying them <b>with money,</b> as derived <b>from</b> a statement <b>of Rav Naḥman. As Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> In <b>three</b> cases the court <b>appraises the enhanced</b> value <b>for</b> the parties involved in enhancing a field, <b>and they are paid in money</b> rather than by being given a portion of the property. <b>And these are they:</b> The first is a <b>firstborn</b> son who makes payment <b>to an ordinary,</b> i.e., non-firstborn, son. This is a case where two sons, one firstborn and the other not, inherit a field from their father. Before it is divided, they both work and enhance the field. When the time comes to divide the field, the firstborn son, who receives a double portion, must pay his brother for the enhancement that the latter contributed to the former’s portion. This payment is given in money rather than land.",
            "<b>And</b> the second case is that of payment taken by <b>a creditor or</b> the payment of <b>a marriage contract</b> by someone who is obligated <b>to</b> reimburse <b>orphans,</b> i.e., a creditor or widow who collects land from the orphans of the deceased debtor or husband, respectively. He or she must pay the orphans for any enhancements they made after their father’s death. This payment is also given in money rather than land. <b>And</b> the third case is that of <b>a creditor</b> who is obligated <b>to purchasers,</b> i.e., a creditor who collects the debt from lands that were sold by the debtor. He pays money to the purchaser for the enhancements generated by the purchaser but does not pay him in land.",
            "<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi:</b> Is this <b>to say that Shmuel maintains</b> that <b>a creditor</b> must pay the value of the enhancement <b>to the buyers? And what</b> type of <b>enhancement is there</b> that is given <b>to a buyer</b> according to Shmuel? <b>But doesn’t Shmuel say: A creditor collects</b> even <b>the enhancement,</b> not only the land itself? <b>And if you would say</b> that this is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>here</b> it is referring <b>to enhancement</b> that is so great <b>that</b> it <b>reaches the shoulders,</b> meaning it is large enough to be carried away on porters’ shoulders, whereas <b>there</b> it is referring <b>to enhancement that does not reach the shoulders,</b> that is still difficult. <b>But aren’t there incidents every day</b> where <b>Shmuel would collect</b> everything on behalf of a creditor, <b>even enhancement that reaches the shoulders?</b>",
            "The Gemara responds: It is <b>not difficult; this</b> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the debtor <b>owed him the amount</b> of the value of <b>the land and the enhancement</b> combined, and therefore the creditor does not leave the buyers with anything, whereas <b>that</b> involves a case <b>where he did not owe him the amount</b> of the value of <b>the land and the enhancement.</b> Since he has taken more than the sum to which he is entitled, he pays the buyers for the improvement.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And if</b> he <b>did not owe</b> him <b>the amount</b> of the value <b>of the land and the enhancement,</b> it was stated <b>that</b> the creditor <b>gives the buyer money and removes him. This works out well according to the one who says</b> that even <b>if the buyer has money he cannot remove the creditor</b> by paying him his debt in cash, as the creditor has the right to claim land. According to this opinion, it works <b>well.

            "The Gemara responds: <b>Here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the debtor <b>set aside</b> this land as <b>designated repayment [<i>apoteiki</i>] for</b> the creditor, <b>as he said to him: You shall be able to collect from only this</b> land, but no other.

The explanation of the dispute would then be as follows: <b>According to the one who says</b> that <b>the upper</b> resident <b>repairs</b> it, <b>he holds</b> that the responsibility is <b>on the one</b> potentially <b>responsible for the damage to distance himself from the</b> one whose property is potentially <b>damaged.</b> This accounts for the opinion of Rabbi Yosei in the mishna, who holds that the resident of the upper story must provide the plaster, because his water is clearly causing damage below. <b>And the one who says</b> that <b>the lower</b> resident <b>repairs</b> it, <b>he holds</b> like the Rabbis, who say that the responsibility is <b>on the</b> one whose property is potentially <b>damaged to distance himself from the one</b> potentially <b>responsible for the damage.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how can <b>you understand</b> it that way? Do <b>Rabbi Yosei and the Rabbis disagree</b> in the mishna <b>with regard to</b> distancing oneself from <b>damages? But haven’t we heard them</b> say <b>the opposite? As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Batra</i> 25b): <b>One must distance a tree twenty-five cubits from a pit,</b> because its roots damage the pit, <b>and</b> in the case <b>of a carob or sycamore</b> tree, whose roots spread far, one must distance it by <b>fifty cubits.</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>whether</b> the pit or tree <b>is</b> located <b>above or to the side</b> of the other. <b>If the pit preceded</b> the tree, the owner of the pit <b>may cut down</b> the tree <b>and pay</b> its <b>monetary</b> value. <b>If the tree preceded</b> the pit, then <b>he may not cut</b> it <b>down.</b> If it is <b>uncertain</b> whether <b>this</b> tree <b>preceded</b> that pit, and it is <b>uncertain</b> whether <b>that</b> pit <b>preceded</b> this tree, <b>he may not cut down</b> the tree.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yosei says: Even if the pit preceded the tree, he may not cut</b> it <b>down.</b> Why is that? <b>As this one digs in his own</b> property, <b>and that one plants in his own</b> property. Consequently, the owner of the pit cannot complain about the damage, and if he wants to avoid it, he can dig his pit elsewhere. <b>Apparently,</b> this mishna indicates that <b>Rabbi Yosei holds</b> that the responsibility is <b>on the</b> one whose property is potentially <b>damaged to distance himself</b> from the one potentially responsible for the damage, <b>and the Rabbis hold</b> that the responsibility is <b>on the one</b> potentially <b>responsible for the damage to distance himself</b> from the one whose property is potentially damaged.",
            "<b>Rather, if it can be said</b> that these <i>amora’im</i> <b>disagree</b> with regard to the issue that is the subject of the dispute between these <i>tanna’im</i>, then <b>they disagree in the dispute between Rabbi Yosei and the Rabbis there,</b> concerning the question of who is obligated to distance himself from the damage, but it has nothing to do with the dispute in the mishna here.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And with regard to what</b> principle <b>do Rabbi Yosei and the Rabbis of</b> the mishna <b>here disagree?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>They disagree with regard to the strength of a ceiling. The Rabbis hold</b> that the function of the <b>plaster is</b> to <b>strengthen the ceiling, and strengthening the ceiling</b> is the obligation <b>of the lower</b> resident, as he is <b>required to strengthen</b> it. <b>And Rabbi Yosei holds</b> that the function of the <b>plaster is</b> to <b>level out</b> any <b>holes,</b> so that the surface of the ceiling will be flat, <b>and leveling out holes</b> it is the obligation <b>of the upper</b> resident, as he is required <b>to level</b> them <b>out.</b>",
            "The Gemara challenges the above conclusion: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rav Ashi say: When I was in the school of Rav Kahana we would say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei concedes</b> in a case <b>of his arrows.</b> Although Rabbi Yosei holds that the responsibility is on the one whose property is potentially damaged to distance himself from the one potentially responsible for the damage, that is only if the one causing the damage is not performing a direct action that is causing the damage, as in the case of the tree and the pit. But if he is performing an action that causes damage from a distance, as in this case, where the water he pours damages the resident of the lower story, he is like someone shooting arrows, who is certainly obligated to ensure that he does not cause any damage.",
            "The Gemara answers: This is a case in <b>which the water</b> flow <b>stops</b> in one place, as the hole in the floor is not directly in the place where the water was poured, <b>and subsequently</b> it <b>falls</b> into the lower story once it flows to the opening in the floor.

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: In three places Rabbi Yehuda taught us</b> the principle that it is <b>forbidden for a person to derive benefit from the property of another</b> without his full awareness and consent, even if the other does not suffer a loss. <b>One</b> of the places where we are taught this principle is <b>that which we learn</b> in the mishna, that Rabbi Yehuda does not allow one to reside in another’s property without paying him rent.",
            "<b>What is another</b> place where we are taught this principle from Rabbi Yehuda’s statements? <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Kamma</i> 100b): If <b>one gives wool to a dyer to dye</b> it <b>red for him and</b> instead <b>he dyed it black,</b> or to dye it <b>black and he dyed it red, Rabbi Meir says:</b> The dyer <b>gives</b> the owner of the wool <b>the value of his wool.

And if the expenses exceed the enhancement, he gives him</b> the value of <b>the enhancement.</b> But the dyer may not keep the dyed wool for himself, as it is forbidden for one to benefit from another’s property.",
            "<b>And what is the other,</b> third place where we are taught this principle from Rabbi Yehuda’s statements? <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Batra</i> 168a): In a case of a debtor <b>who repaid part of his debt, and he deposited</b> the promissory <b>note with a third party</b> serving as a trustee, to ensure that the creditor not collect the full amount, <b>and</b> the debtor <b>said to</b> the trustee: <b>If I do not give you</b> the balance <b>from now until such and such a time, give</b> the creditor <b>his</b> promissory <b>note,</b> thereby enabling him to collect the full amount stated in the note; if the stipulated <b>time arrived and</b> the debtor <b>has not given</b> the balance to the trustee, <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The trustee <b>shall give</b> the promissory note to the creditor, in accordance with the debtor’s stipulation. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The trustee <b>shall not give</b> it, as the stipulation is void.

            "The Gemara refutes these proofs as to the general applicability of Rabbi Yehuda’s rulings. <b>Why</b> is it necessary to explain in this manner? <b>Perhaps Rabbi Yehuda</b> is <b>saying</b> this <b>only here,</b> with regard to the case of the mishna concerning a house and an upper story, <b>only because there is</b> the <b>blackening</b> of the walls. By using the house, the owner of the upper story causes its walls to blacken, thereby lowering its value, and yet he will ultimately claim the value of a new house that he built. Therefore, he is prohibited from using the house without paying.",
            "<b>Alternatively,</b> if one attempts to prove a general principle from the case where one instructed a dyer <b>to dye</b> the wool <b>for him red and he dyed it black,</b> it can be explained that the reason for the ruling of Rabbi Yehuda is <b>due to</b> the fact that the dyer <b>is changing</b> and deviating from the owner’s instructions, <b>and didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (76a) that <b>whoever changes</b> the terms accepted by both parties <b>is at a disadvantage?</b>",
