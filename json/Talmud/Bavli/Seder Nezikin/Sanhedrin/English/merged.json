            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Cases concerning <b>monetary law</b> are adjudicated <b>by three</b> judges. Cases concerning <b>robbery and</b> personal <b>injury</b> are adjudicated <b>by three</b> judges. Cases concerning <b>damage</b> that one is responsible for because he or his property caused the damage are adjudicated by three judges as well. Likewise, cases concerning payment for <b>half the damage,</b> which is paid in the event that an ox whose owner has not been warned that it gored more than two times gores another animal (see Exodus 21:35); cases concerning <b>payment of double</b> the principal by a thief who was caught stealing (see Exodus 22:3); <b>and</b> cases concerning <b>payment of four or five</b> times the principal by a thief who slaughtered or sold a stolen ox or a lamb (see Exodus 21:37) are all adjudicated <b>by three</b> judges.",
            "Cases concerning <b>one who rapes or one who seduces</b> a virgin girl, and must therefore pay the girl’s father fifty silver shekels (see Deuteronomy 22:29, Exodus 22:15); <b>and</b> cases concerning <b>a defamer</b> who falsely asserts that his wife was not a virgin when she married him, and brings false witnesses who testify that she committed adultery while betrothed to him and who must therefore pay the girl’s father one hundred silver shekels as well as receive lashes (see Deuteronomy 22:13–19): All of these are adjudicated <b>by three</b> judges; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>",
            "<b>And the Rabbis say:</b> Cases concerning <b>a defamer</b> are adjudicated <b>by</b> a court of <b>twenty-three</b> judges, which is the type of court authorized to judge cases of capital law, <b>because</b> this case <b>includes</b> the possibility of becoming a case of <b>capital law.</b> The husband brings witnesses that his wife committed adultery. If she is found guilty, she is liable to receive the death penalty. This punishment applies to the witnesses if they are exposed as conspiring witnesses.",
            "Cases concerning the violation of prohibitions that render one liable to receive <b>lashes</b> are adjudicated <b>by three</b> judges. The Sages <b>stated in the name of Rabbi Yishmael:</b> Cases concerning lashes are adjudicated <b>by twenty-three</b> judges.",
            "The <b>intercalation of the month</b> is performed <b>by</b> a panel of <b>three</b> judges. The <b>intercalation of the year,</b> meaning the decision to add an extra month to the year when necessary, is also decided <b>by</b> a panel of <b>three</b> judges; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> The deliberations <b>begin with three</b> judges, <b>and they debate</b> the matter <b>with five</b> judges, <b>and they conclude</b> the matter <b>with seven</b> judges, due to the significance of the decision. <b>And</b> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel concedes that <b>if they concluded</b> the matter <b>with</b> only <b>three</b> judges, the intercalation is valid and it is <b>a leap</b> year.",
            "Both the <b>laying of hands by the Sages and the breaking of the heifer’s neck</b> in a case where a person was found murdered and it is not known who killed him (see Deuteronomy 21:1–9) are performed in front of a panel <b>of three</b> judges; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Shimon. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> These rituals are performed in front <b>of five</b> judges. Both <b><i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> the ritual through which the <i>yavam</i>, a surviving brother of a married man who died without sons, frees the <i>yevama</i>, the widow, of her levirate bond in a case where the <i>yavam</i> does not wish to marry the <i>yevama</i> (see Deuteronomy 25:5–10), <b>and the refusal</b> of a girl before reaching majority to remain married to the man to whom her mother or brother married her off, are performed before a court <b>of three</b> judges.",
            "The <i>halakha</i> concerning fruit of a fourth-year sapling and second-tithe produce is that they are to be brought to Jerusalem and eaten there. If this is impractical, the produce can be redeemed and the redemption money brought to Jerusalem, where it is used to purchase food and drink. Valuation of fruit of <b>a fourth-year sapling or second-tithe</b> produce in cases <b>where their value is not known</b> is performed <b>by three</b> judges. The valuation of <b>consecrated</b> property for purposes of redemption is performed <b>by three</b> judges, and <b>the valuations that are movable property</b> (see Leviticus 27:1–8) are performed <b>by three</b> judges. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One of</b> the three judges must be <b>a priest.</b>",
            "<b>And the</b> valuation of consecrated <b>land</b> is performed by <b>nine</b> judges <b>and,</b> in addition, one <b>priest. And</b> the valuation of <b>a person</b> for the purpose of a vow is performed in <b>a similar manner to</b> that of land.",
            "§ Cases of <b>capital law</b> are judged <b>by twenty-three</b> judges. <b>An animal that copulated with a person and an animal that was the object of bestiality</b> are judged <b>by twenty-three</b> judges, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And if a woman approaches any animal to lie with it, <b>you shall kill the woman and the animal”</b> (Leviticus 20:16), <b>and it states:</b> “And if a man lies with an animal, he shall be put to death <b>and you shall kill the animal”</b> (Leviticus 20:15). In cases of bestiality, the verse juxtaposes the execution of the animal to the execution of the person, and therefore the case of the animal is adjudicated in the same way as cases of capital law.",
            "Similarly, <b>an ox that is</b> to be <b>stoned</b> because it killed a person is judged <b>by twenty-three</b> judges, <b>as it is stated:</b> “But if the ox was wont to gore in time past, and warning has been given to its owner, but he did not guard it and it kills a man or a woman <b>the ox shall be stoned and also its owner shall be put to death”</b> (Exodus 21:29). From this verse it is derived that <b>just as</b> the manner of <b>the death of the owner, so is</b> the manner of <b>the death of the ox.</b> The same <i>halakha</i> applies in the case of <b>a wolf or a lion, a bear or a leopard, or a cheetah, or a snake</b> that killed a person: <b>Their death</b> is decreed <b>by twenty-three</b> judges. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says</b> these dangerous animals do not need to be brought to court; rather, <b>anyone who kills them first merits</b> the performance of a mitzva. <b>Rabbi Akiva says: Their death</b> is decreed <b>by twenty-three</b> judges.",
            "§ The court <b>judges</b> cases involving an entire <b>tribe</b> that sinned, <b>or a false prophet</b> (see Deuteronomy 18:20–22), <b>or a High Priest</b> who transgressed a prohibition that carries a possible death sentence, <b>only on the basis of a court of seventy-one</b> judges, i.e., the Great Sanhedrin. <b>And</b> the king may <b>bring</b> the nation <b>out to an optional war,</b> i.e., a war that was not mandated by the Torah and is not a war of defense, <b>only on the basis of a court of seventy-one</b> judges. <b>They may extend the city</b> of Jerusalem <b>or the courtyards</b> of the Temple <b>only on the basis of a court of seventy-one</b> judges. <b>And</b> they may <b>appoint</b> a lesser <b>Sanhedrin</b> of twenty-three judges <b>for the tribes only on the basis of a court of seventy-one</b> judges.",
            "A city <b>may be designated</b> as <b>an idolatrous city,</b> i.e., a city whose residents all practice idolatry, and therefore according to Torah law all the residents must be killed and the city must be destroyed (see Deuteronomy 13:13–19), <b>only in accordance with</b> the ruling of <b>a court of seventy-one</b> judges. Additionally, the court <b>may not designate</b> a city as <b>an idolatrous city</b> if it is <b>on the frontier,</b> close to the borders of Eretz Yisrael, <b>and three</b> adjoining cities may <b>not</b> be designated as idolatrous cities. <b>But</b> the court <b>may designate one</b> city, <b>or two</b> adjoining cities, as idolatrous cities.",
            "§ With regard to the number of judges in the different courts the mishna presents a halakhic midrash: The <b>Great Sanhedrin was</b> composed <b>of seventy-one</b> judges, <b>and a lesser</b> Sanhedrin was composed <b>of twenty-three. From where</b> is it derived <b>that the Great</b> Sanhedrin <b>was</b> composed <b>of seventy-one</b> judges? <b>As it is stated: “Gather Me seventy men of the Elders of Israel,</b> whom you know to be the Elders of the people and officers over them, and bring them into the Tent of Meeting, and they shall stand there with you” (Numbers 11:16), <b>and</b> together with <b>Moses at the head of</b> this body, there are a total of seventy-one. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> Moses was indeed at the head of the body, but he is not counted as part of the group. Consequently, a future Great Sanhedrin modeled after these Elders is to be composed of <b>seventy</b> judges.",
            "<b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that a lesser</b> Sanhedrin <b>is</b> composed <b>of twenty-three</b> judges? <b>As it is stated: “And the congregation shall judge</b> between the assailant and the avenger…<b>and the congregation shall save</b> the manslayer from the hands of the avenger” (Numbers 35:24–25). Therefore, there must be <b>a congregation,</b> which consists of at least ten judges, that <b>judges</b> the accused and attempts to convict him, <b>and</b> there must be <b>a congregation,</b> also consisting of at least ten judges, which attempts to <b>save</b> the accused by finding him innocent. Together, <b>there are twenty</b> judges <b>here.</b>",
            "Before proceeding to derive the requirement for the final three judges, the mishna clarifies: <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that a congregation</b> consists <b>of</b> at least <b>ten</b> men? <b>As it is stated</b> concerning the spies: <b>“How long shall I bear with this evil congregation</b> that keep complaining about me?” (Numbers 14:27) There were twelve spies; <b>excluding Joshua and Caleb,</b> who did not complain, there would be ten men who are called: A congregation. Accordingly, the verses describing a congregation that attempts to convict the accused and a congregation that attempts to acquit him together add up to twenty judges.",
            "<b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>to bring three more</b> judges to the court? <b>From the implication of that</b> which <b>is stated: “You shall not follow a multitude to convict”</b> (Exodus 23:2), <b>I</b> would <b>derive that</b> I may not convict a person on the basis of a majority but <b>I should follow</b> the majority <b>to exonerate. If so, why is it stated</b> in the same verse: <b>“To incline after a multitude,”</b> from which it can be understood that the majority is followed in all cases? In order to resolve the apparent contradiction it must be explained: <b>Your inclination</b> after the majority <b>to exonerate is not like your inclination</b> after the majority <b>to convict. Your inclination</b> after the majority <b>to exonerate</b> can result in a verdict <b>by</b> a majority of <b>one</b> judge. But <b>your inclination</b> after the majority <b>to convict</b> a transgressor must be <b>by</b> a more decisive majority of at least <b>two.</b> Therefore, the court must have at least twenty-two judges."
        ],
        [
            "<b>And</b> since there is a principle that <b>a court may not</b> be composed of <b>an even</b> number of judges, as such a court may be unable to reach a decision, therefore <b>they add another one to them,</b> and <b>there are twenty-three</b> judges <b>here.</b>",
            "<b>And how many</b> men must <b>be in the city for</b> it <b>to be eligible for</b> a lesser <b>Sanhedrin? One hundred and twenty. Rabbi Neḥemya says: Two hundred and thirty, corresponding to the ministers of tens,</b> as outlined by Moses and Yitro in the wilderness (Exodus, chapter 18). That is to say, each member of the Sanhedrin can be viewed as a judge with responsibility for ten residents. If there are not enough men in the city to enable this calculation, it would not be honorable to appoint a Sanhedrin, as their members will each preside over less than the minimum of ten residents.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that cases of monetary law are adjudicated by three judges, and that cases of robbery and personal injury must also be adjudicated by three judges. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say</b> that cases of <b>robbery and</b> personal <b>injury are not</b> cases of <b>monetary law?</b> Obviously they are; why did the mishna delineate them separately? <b>Rabbi Abbahu says:</b> The mishna <b>teaches</b> this clause employing the style: <b>What are these,</b> meaning that the expression: Cases of monetary law, is a description of a category, followed by the specification. Accordingly, the mishna should be read as follows: <b>What are these</b> cases of <b>monetary law</b> that are adjudicated by three judges? Cases of <b>robbery and</b> personal <b>injury. But</b> cases of <b>admissions,</b> where one party admits that he owes another money, <b>and</b> cases of <b>loans</b> that were not repaid are <b>not</b> included in this <i>halakha</i>.",
            "<b>And</b> this specification <b>is necessary, as had</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> only that cases of <b>monetary law</b> are adjudicated by three judges, <b>I would say that</b> this applies <b>even</b> to cases of <b>admissions and loans.</b> Therefore, to avoid this misunderstanding, <b>he taught:</b> Cases of <b>robbery and</b> personal <b>injury,</b> in order to clarify that only they are included in the <i>halakha</i>. <b>And had he taught</b> only cases of <b>robbery and</b> personal <b>injury and had not taught</b> cases of <b>monetary law, I would say</b> that <b>the same is true even</b> with regard to <b>admissions and loans,</b> that they are adjudicated in the same manner. <b>And</b> I would understand <b>this</b> fact, <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> specifically cases of <b>robbery and</b> personal <b>injury,</b> by saying that these are mere examples and that the mishna mentions them <b>because</b> in the <b>primary</b> cases in which the requirement for <b>three</b> judges <b>is written</b> in the Torah, <b>it is written with regard to</b> cases of <b>robbery and</b> personal <b>injury.</b>",
            "The Gemara explains this assertion. With regard to cases of <b>robbery, as it is written</b> with regard to a bailee who accepted a deposit from another and then claims that it was stolen: <b>“The owner of the house shall come near the court [<i>ha’elohim</i>],</b> to see whether he has not put his hand upon his neighbor’s property” (Exodus 22:7). And with regard to cases of personal <b>injury,</b> they are adjudicated in the same manner as cases of robbery, because <b>what</b> difference <b>is</b> there <b>to me</b> if another <b>injured one’s body</b> and <b>what</b> difference <b>is</b> there <b>to me</b> if another <b>injured one’s property?</b> Therefore, in order to clarify that the <i>halakha</i> applies only to cases of robbery and injury, the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught: What are these</b> cases of <b>monetary law?</b> Cases of <b>robbery and</b> personal <b>injury. But</b> this <i>halakha</i> does <b>not</b> apply with regard to cases of <b>admissions and loans.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And with regard to which</b> <i>halakha</i> are cases of admissions and loans unlike cases of robbery and injury? <b>If we say that we do not need</b> a court of <b>three</b> judges to adjudicate such cases, <b>but doesn’t Rabbi Abbahu say:</b> With regard to a court of <b>two</b> judges <b>that adjudicated</b> cases of <b>monetary law</b> of any type, which would include cases of admissions and loans, <b>everyone agrees</b> that <b>their judgment is not</b> a valid <b>judgment,</b> as a court with fewer than three judges is invalid?",
            "The Gemara answers: This is not the difference between the categories; <b>rather,</b> the difference is <b>that</b> for cases of admissions and loans <b>we do not require expert,</b> ordained judges who have studied extensively and received permission to judge; any three laymen can serve as a court for these types of cases. The mishna singled out cases of robbery and personal injury in order to indicate that for those cases expert judges are necessary.",
            "The Gemara clarifies: <b>What does</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>hold? If he holds</b> that <b>a merging of</b> Torah <b>portions is written here,</b> then <b>he should also require expert</b> judges for cases of admissions and loans. The passage from which the <i>halakha</i> requiring three judges is derived (Exodus 22:6–8) discusses several different <i>halakhot</i>. According to the understanding that these portions should be considered as merged, they are interpreted to indicate equivalence between those <i>halakhot</i>. <b>And if he holds</b> that <b>there is no merging of</b> Torah <b>portions written here,</b> meaning that the <i>halakhot</i> are to be derived only from verses that discuss them directly, then <b>why do I</b> need <b>three</b> judges for admissions and loans? The requirement for three judges is derived from the repetition of the word <i>elohim</i> three times in the context of cases of robbery and personal injury.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>holds</b> that <b>a merging of</b> Torah <b>portions is written here, and by right</b> he <b>should have required expert</b> judges to judge cases of admissions and loans <b>as well. And this</b> fact, i.e., <b>that we do not require expert</b> judges for these cases, is <b>due to</b> the reasoning <b>of Rabbi Ḥanina, as Rabbi Ḥanina says: By Torah law, both</b> cases of <b>monetary law and</b> cases of <b>capital law</b> require <b>inquiry and interrogation</b> of witnesses in order to conclusively determine the time, place, and circumstance of the incident, with the purpose of finding any possible contradiction in the witnesses’ testimony."
        ],
        [
            "The source for this is <b>as it is stated: “You shall have one manner of law”</b> (Leviticus 24:22), from which it is derived that all judges must judge in the same manner. And since with regard to cases of capital law it is stated: “And you shall inquire and investigate, and ask diligently” (Deuteronomy 13:15), the same should apply to cases of monetary law. <b>And what is the reason</b> that the Sages <b>said</b> that in cases of <b>monetary law we do not require inquiry and interrogation</b> of witnesses? The Gemara answers: The Sages established this exemption <b>so as not to lock the door in the face of</b> potential <b>borrowers.</b> If inquiry and interrogation of the witnesses would be required in order to have the court rule that the lender can collect payment of a loan, lenders would be deterred by the difficulty of proving the matter and might cease to lend money to the poor. For the same reason, the Sages also waived the need for expert judges in these cases.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> then if these laymen <b>err they should not</b> be liable to <b>pay</b> compensation to the party unfairly wronged by their judgment, just as expert judges are not liable. The Gemara responds: If this is the <i>halakha</i>, <b>you are all the more so locking the door in the face of</b> potential <b>borrowers;</b> wealthy people will not want to lend money, as they will fear that a court of laymen will judge the case incorrectly.",
            "With regard to Rabbi Abbahu’s method of explaining the mishna, the Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> then instead of explaining the mishna employing the style: What are these, Rabbi Abbahu could more easily say that <b>two</b> matters <b>are taught</b> in the mishna, and explain it as follows: Cases of <b>monetary law,</b> meaning cases of admissions and loans, are adjudicated <b>by three</b> judges who could be non-ordained <b>laymen [<i>hedyotot</i>],</b> and cases of <b>robbery and</b> personal <b>injury</b> are adjudicated <b>by three</b> ordained, <b>expert</b> judges.",
            "<b>And furthermore,</b> according to Rabbi Abbahu’s explanation that the term: Cases of robbery and personal injury, simply clarifies the meaning of the term: Cases of monetary law, <b>why do I</b> need the repetitive statement that cases of monetary law are adjudicated by <b>three</b> judges and cases of robbery and injury are adjudicated by <b>three</b> judges? The repetition seems to indicate that these are two separate matters.",
            "<b>Rather, Rava said: Two</b> matters <b>are</b> in fact <b>taught</b> in the mishna, <b>because</b> of the statement <b>of Rabbi Ḥanina</b> that the Sages instituted leniencies with regard to cases of monetary law so as not to lock the door in the face of potential borrowers. <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said: By Torah law,</b> the adjudication of <b>one</b> judge is <b>also valid</b> in cases of admissions and loans, <b>as it is stated: “In righteousness shall you judge your neighbor”</b> (Leviticus 19:15), in the singular. <b>But</b> by rabbinic law, three judges are required, <b>due to</b> the concern that a single judge may be one of <b>those who sit</b> idly on street <b>corners,</b> i.e., unlearned people who are not involved in business and are unlikely to judge the case correctly.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>with three</b> judges <b>they</b> will <b>not be</b> among <b>those who sit</b> idly on street <b>corners?</b> How is this concern addressed by increasing the number of judges? The Gemara answers: When there are three judges <b>it is impossible,</b> i.e., highly unlikely, <b>that there is not among them one who is learned.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> then if <b>they err they should not</b> be liable to <b>pay</b> compensation, since rabbinic law authorizes laymen to judge cases of this nature. The Gemara answers: If the judges will be exempt from paying compensation in the event that they err in their judgment, this lack of accountability will lead <b>all the more so</b> to having <b>many</b> of <b>those who sit</b> idly on street <b>corners</b> assume the role of judges.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What are</b> the implications of the difference <b>between</b> the opinion of <b>Rava,</b> who says that cases of monetary law may be adjudicated by three laymen due to the statement of Rabbi Ḥanina, <b>and</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika,</b> who holds that according to the Torah one judge is sufficient? The Gemara answers: The difference <b>between</b> them is with regard to <b>that</b> which <b>Shmuel says:</b> If <b>two</b> people <b>adjudicated</b> a case, <b>their judgment</b> is a valid <b>judgment, but they are called an impudent court. Rava is of</b> the opinion that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>not</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of Shmuel,</b> as he holds that three judges are required by Torah law. <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, is of</b> the opinion that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Shmuel,</b> as he holds that fundamentally, even one judge may judge a case of monetary law.",
            "§ The mishna teaches that cases involving payment for <b>damage and</b> payment for <b>half the damage</b> are adjudicated by three judges. The Gemara challenges: <b>Damage is</b> the same as <b>injury,</b> since the term: Injury, includes various damages one causes another directly or by his property. The Gemara explains: <b>Since he needed to teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to payment of <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage, he also taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to payment of the <b>full</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b>",
            "The Gemara challenges: Payment of <b>half the damage is also</b> the same as personal <b>injury,</b> so it did not need to be stated separately. The Gemara explains: There is a difference. The <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a case of <b>monetary matters, and</b> he also <b>taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a case of <b>a fine,</b> such as payment of half the damage in a case where an innocuous ox gored another animal. Consequently, payment of half the cost of the damage needed to be stated separately from payment for injury, and once he needed to teach the <i>halakha</i> with regard to payment for half the cost of the damage, he first mentioned general payments for damages.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that <b>the</b> payment for <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage</b> is considered <b>a fine,</b> meaning that according to the standard <i>halakhot</i> of damages the owner of the goring ox should be exempt, and the Torah instituted a payment of half the cost of the damage as a penalty for not being exceedingly careful. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that <b>the</b> payment for <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage</b> is an actual <b>monetary</b> payment, meaning that according to the standard <i>halakhot</i> of damages the owner of the goring ox should be fully liable but the Torah exempted him from part of his liability due to the unusual nature of the damage, <b>what can be said?</b> Therefore, this explanation must be rejected.",
            "<b>Rather, since</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>needed to teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to cases involving <b>payment of double</b> the principal <b>and payment of four or five</b> times the principal, <b>which</b> are cases of <b>money</b>"

        [
            "<b>that is not paid according to its value,</b> meaning that the payment is not equal to the cost of the damage but is actually more than that amount, <b>he also taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to payment of <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage, which is</b> also <b>money that is not paid according to its value,</b> as he pays less than the full cost of the damage. <b>And since he needs to teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to payment of <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage, he also taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to payment of the full cost of the <b>damage.</b>",
            "§ The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive the fundamental requirement for <b>three</b> judges? The Gemara answers: This is <b>as the Sages taught:</b> The verse states: <b>“The owner of the house shall come near the court,</b> to see whether he has not put his hand upon his neighbor’s property” (Exodus 22:7), so <b>there is one</b> judge <b>here.</b> The following verse states: <b>“The cause of both parties shall come before the court,”</b> so <b>there are two</b> judges <b>here.</b> And that verse concludes: <b>“He whom the court shall condemn</b> shall pay double to his neighbor,” so <b>there are three</b> judges <b>here,</b> corresponding to the three mentions of the term “the court.” This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yoshiya.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Yonatan says: The first</b> instance of the term “the court” <b>is stated first</b> as part of the primary text of the passage, and it is necessary for conveying the straightforward meaning of the verse. <b>And one does not derive</b> tallies for halakhic matters by counting the <b>first</b> mention of a term. Rabbi Yonatan holds that when a tally is derived from the number of instances a certain word appears in the Torah, the first instance is not included in the tally, as it is necessary to teach the mitzva itself; the tally may be counted only from subsequent mentions. <b>Rather,</b> this is how it is derived: <b>“The cause of both parties shall come before the court,” there is one</b> judge <b>here,</b> and the continuation of the verse: <b>“He whom the court shall condemn”</b> teaches that <b>there are two</b> judges <b>here. And</b> since <b>a court may not</b> be composed of <b>an even</b> number of judges, <b>they</b> must <b>add an additional one to them,</b> so <b>there are three</b> judges <b>here.</b>",
            "<b>Let us say</b> that Rabbi Yoshiya and Rabbi Yonatan <b>disagree with regard to</b> whether <b>one derives</b> tallies for halakhic matters from the <b>first</b> mention of a term in the Torah. <b>As</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoshiya, <b>holds</b> that <b>one derives</b> tallies from the <b>first</b> mention of the term in the Torah, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yonatan, <b>holds</b> that <b>one does not derive</b> tallies from the <b>first</b> mention of the term. The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No,</b> actually <b>everyone</b> holds that <b>one does not derive</b> tallies from the <b>first</b> mention of the term, but in this case there is a separate source for the derivation, as <b>Rabbi Yoshiya</b> could have <b>said to you: If it is true</b> that no <i>halakha</i> is derived from the first mention, <b>let the verse say: The owner of the house shall come near to the judge [<i>hashofet</i>]. What,</b> then, is the significance of the unique expression: <b>“To the court [<i>haelohim</i>]”? Conclude from it</b> that the term <i>elohim</i> was chosen <b>to</b> count toward <b>the tally.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how would <b>Rabbi Yonatan</b> respond to this analysis? The Gemara answers: He would say that the verse <b>employed the</b> common <b>language of the world, as people say: One who has a case,</b> a claim against another, <b>should approach the</b> regular <b>judge,</b> the one who generally judges cases and can be referred to by the term <i>elohim</i>. Consequently, no unique <i>halakha</i> can be derived from this first usage.",
            "<b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yoshiya accept</b> the principle that <b>a court</b> must be composed of <b>an odd</b> number of judges? <b>And isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, says: What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “To incline after a multitude to pervert justice”</b> (Exodus 23:2)? The meaning is that <b>the Torah is saying</b> to you: <b>Make for yourself a court</b> that is composed of an odd number of judges, that will perforce <b>incline</b> in one direction, so that there will always be a majority that can be followed.",
            "The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yoshiya does not accept this <i>halakha</i> but instead <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who says:</b> A Great Sanhedrin is composed of <b>seventy</b> judges. <b>As we learned</b> in the mishna: The <b>Great Sanhedrin was</b> composed <b>of seventy-one</b> judges, and <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> It is composed of <b>seventy</b> judges. Clearly, Rabbi Yehuda does not accept the principle that a court must be composed of an odd number of judges.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Say that you heard</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> said this <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to the Great Sanhedrin,</b> about <b>which</b> specific <b>verses are written,</b> and he derives from these verses that the Great Sanhedrin must be composed of exactly seventy judges. <b>Have you heard him</b> say <b>with regard to the rest of the courts,</b> those whose composition is not explicitly addressed in the Torah, that these courts can also be composed of an even number of judges?",
            "<b>And if you would say: There is no difference;</b> Rabbi Yehuda does not differentiate between the Great Sanhedrin and lower courts, <b>but didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: The <b>laying of hands by the Sages and the breaking of the heifer’s neck</b> are performed in front of a panel <b>of three</b> judges; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Shimon.

The term: <b>“Shall lay their hands,”</b> which is in the plural, indicates that there are <b>two,</b> and the word <b>“Elders,”</b> which is also plural, indicates another <b>two,</b> meaning a total of four. <b>And</b> since <b>a court may not</b> be composed of <b>an even</b> number of judges, <b>we add another one to them,</b> and <b>there are five</b> judges <b>here.</b> Consequently, Rabbi Yehuda does accept the <i>halakha</i> that a court may not be composed of an even number of judges.",
            "The Gemara answers: It can be explained <b>that Rabbi Yoshiya</b> holds in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> but <b>goes further than</b> he does.

The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yoshiya <b>interprets it in</b> relation to cases of <b>capital law.</b> In such cases he agrees that the court must be composed of an odd number of judges, in order that it will be possible to exonerate the accused on the basis of a majority of one judge.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But does</b> Rabbi Yoshiya <b>not</b> accept the requirement for an odd number of judges <b>with regard to</b> cases of <b>monetary law?

Let us say that</b> this mishna is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoshiya,</b> as Rabbi Yoshiya does not accept the requirement for an odd number of judges concerning cases of monetary law, and therefore perhaps he holds that the verdict must be agreed upon unanimously by all the judges.",
            "The Gemara rejects this possibility: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoshiya.</b> Although he does not accept the requirement for an odd number of judges in cases of monetary law, he does allow for a decision on the basis of a majority. <b>He derives this</b> principle based <b>on an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> cases of <b>capital law: If</b> concerning cases of <b>capital law, which are strict, the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>Follow the majority,</b> and does not require a unanimous ruling, concerning cases of <b>monetary law,</b> which are more lenient, is it <b>not all the more so</b> clear that a majority ruling is sufficient?",
            "§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> Cases concerning <b>monetary law</b> are adjudicated <b>by three</b> judges. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> They are adjudicated <b>by five</b> judges, <b>so that a verdict can be issued with three</b> judges. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say</b> that with a court <b>of three</b> judges <b>a verdict cannot be issued by two</b> judges? The Gemara answers: <b>This is</b> what Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>is saying:</b> Cases of monetary law are adjudicated by five judges, <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that a verdict</b> must be issued <b>by three.</b> In other words, according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi the judges who form the majority that decides the verdict must themselves be eligible to constitute a court. <b>Evidently,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds</b> that <b>when</b> the requirement for <b>three</b> judges <b>is written</b> in the Torah, it <b>is written with regard to</b> the number of judges necessary to issue <b>the verdict.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Abbahu</b> would <b>ridicule [<i>megaddef</i> ] this</b> suggestion. <b>If that is so,</b> then <b>the Great Sanhedrin would need</b> to consist of <b>141</b> judges, <b>so that the verdict can be issued by seventy-one, and a lesser Sanhedrin would need</b> to consist of <b>forty-five</b> judges, <b>so that the verdict can be issued by twenty-three.</b> But these assertions contradict the <i>halakha</i> as derived from the verses.",
            "<b>Rather, the Merciful One states: “Gather Me seventy men</b> of the Elders of Israel” (Numbers 11:16), and this means that <b>from the time of gathering,</b> there must be <b>seventy.</b> Likewise, the verse states: <b>“And the congregation shall judge…and the congregation shall save”</b> (Numbers 35:24–25), from which it is derived that cases of capital law are adjudicated by twenty-three judges, and this <b>also</b> means that <b>from the time that the congregation judges</b> there must be twenty-three. <b>Similarly,</b> with regard to a case of monetary law, the verse states: <b>“The owner of the house shall come near to the court”</b> (Exodus 22:7), and this means <b>from the time of coming near</b> to judge the cases there must be <b>three</b> judges. Consequently, there is no requirement that the verdict be decided by a majority who could themselves form a court.",
            "Therefore, the previous explanation must be rejected. <b>Rather, this is the reasoning of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: It is stated in the next verse: <b>“He whom the court shall condemn”</b> (Exodus 22:8) in the plural, which means there must be <b>two</b> judges. Consequently, <b>it is stated: “The court,”</b> in the verse <b>below and it is stated: “The court,”</b> in the verse <b>above.

        ],
        [
            "<b>And</b> how would <b>the Rabbis</b> respond to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s proof? They would say that although the term: <b>“Shall condemn”</b> is pronounced as a plural verb, it is <b>written</b> in a way that could also be read in the singular. Consequently, one cannot derive a requirement for more than one judge from there.",
            "§ The dispute between Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and the Sages is explained as an example of the more general question of whether the written consonantal text or the vocalization of the Torah is authoritative. As <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Yosei says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Roetz, Beit Shammai, Rabbi Shimon, and Rabbi Akiva, they all hold</b> that the <b>vocalization</b> of the Torah <b>is authoritative,</b> and that the <i>halakha</i> is therefore decided based on the meaning of the word as pronounced, and not on possible alternative readings of the written text.",
            "The Gemara explains the basis for Rabbi Yoḥanan’s assertion with regard to each of the <i>tanna’im</i> that he mentioned: With regard to <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, the proof is <b>that which we have</b> just <b>said,</b> with regard to the interpretation of the verse: “He whom the court shall condemn” (Exodus 22:8) deriving a requirement for five judges in cases of monetary law based on the vocalized plural pronunciation of the term: “Shall condemn.”",
            "<b>And</b> with regard to <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Roetz,</b> it is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: His <b>students asked Rabbi Yehuda ben Roetz:</b> The verse states: “But if she gives birth to a female, then she shall be unclean for two weeks, as in her menstrual impurity; and she shall then continue in the blood of purification for sixty-six days” (Leviticus 12:5). Based on the written consonantal text, <b>I can read</b> the amount of time she is impure as: <b>“Seventy [<i>shivim</i>]</b> days,” and not as: “Two weeks [<i>shevuayim</i>].” One <b>might</b> have thought, therefore, that a woman who <b>gives birth to a female should be impure</b> for <b>seventy</b> days.",
            "Rabbi Yehuda ben Roetz <b>said to them:</b> It can be proven that this is not the <i>halakha</i>, as the Torah <b>deemed</b> her <b>impure and deemed</b> her <b>pure</b> when she gave birth <b>to a male, and deemed</b> her <b>impure and deemed</b> her <b>pure</b> when she gave birth <b>to a female. Just as when it deemed</b> her <b>pure</b> for thirty-three days after the initial period of impurity when she gave birth <b>to a male,</b> when she gives birth <b>to a female</b> she is pure for sixty-six days, which is <b>double</b> the amount of time; <b>so too, when it deemed</b> her <b>impure</b> for seven days when she gave birth <b>to a male,</b> when she gives birth <b>to a female</b> she is also impure for <b>double</b> the amount of time. Consequently, the verse must be read according to the vocalized reading: “Two weeks,” and not according to the consonantal text, which could be read: “Seventy.”",
            "<b>After they left,</b> Rabbi Yehuda ben Roetz <b>went out and followed them.</b> He then <b>said to them: You do not need this</b> proof that I gave based on the comparison of the periods of impurity with the periods of purity. Rather, <b>we read</b> the verse as: <b>“Two weeks,” and</b> the <b>vocalization</b> of the Torah <b>is authoritative.</b>",
            "With regard to <b>Beit Shammai,</b> the proof that they also hold that the vocalization of the Torah is authoritative is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 36b): <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> With regard to <b>all</b> offerings <b>whose</b> blood must be <b>presented on the external altar,</b> once the blood has been <b>presented with one presentation</b> the offering <b>has effected atonement,</b> even if more presentations are ideally required, <b>as it is stated: “And the blood of your offerings shall be poured out</b> against the altar of the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 12:27). This verse teaches that even with regard to a burnt-offering, which requires multiple presentations of the blood, a single presentation is sufficient to render the offering valid after the fact. <b>But with regard to a sin-offering,</b> it is valid only if there were at least <b>two presentations. And Beit Hillel say: Even with regard to a sin-offering that one presented with one presentation, it has effected atonement</b> after the fact.",
            "<b>And Rav Huna says: What is the reasoning</b> for the opinion <b>of Beit Shammai?</b> The verse states: “And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it on the <b>horns</b> of the altar” (Leviticus 4:25); and “The priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put it on the <b>horns</b> of the altar” (Leviticus 4:30); and again: “The priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it on the <b>horns</b> of the altar” (Leviticus 4:34). As the minimum amount justifying the use of plural, i.e., “horns,” is two, one may conclude that <b>there are six</b> references to the horns of the altar <b>here. Four</b> of them are mentioned <b>for the mitzva,</b> meaning that he should present the blood on all four horns of the altar <i>ab initio</i>, <b>and</b> the other <b>two</b> were mentioned <b>to invalidate</b> the offering if he did not present it on at least two horns.",
            "<b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> The matter should be understood according to the written consonantal text. The word <b>“horns”</b> is written once plene, with a <i>vav</i>, which means that it must be read in the plural; and the other two times the words <b>“horns”</b> and <b>“horns”</b> are written deficient, without a <i>vav</i>, in a way that can be vocalized in the singular. Therefore, <b>there are four</b> references to horns <b>here. Three</b> of these presentations are written <b>to</b> indicate that they are performed only as <b>a mitzva,</b> i.e., they are performed <i>ab initio</i>, but the offering is valid even absent their presentation. <b>And</b> the remaining <b>one,</b> i.e., the fourth presentation, is written <b>to</b> indicate that its absence <b>invalidates</b> the offering, i.e., the offering is not valid if the blood was not presented against at least one horn of the altar. Evidently, Beit Shammai hold the vocalization is authoritative, whereas Beit Hillel hold the consonantal text is authoritative.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to this explanation of Beit Hillel, why not <b>say</b> that <b>all of them are</b> written <b>for the mitzva</b> and none to invalidate, meaning the blood must be presented on all four horns <i>ab initio</i>, but the offering atones after the fact even if it has not been presented at all? The Gemara rejects this possibility: <b>We have not found</b> anywhere in the Torah an example of an offering in which <b>atonement</b> can be achieved <b>with no</b> presentation of the blood of the offering at all.",
            "With regard to <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> it is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that records a dispute among the Sages with regard to the number of walls required in a <i>sukka</i>: There must be <b>two</b> walls <b>in their standard sense,</b> completely closing each of those two sides, <b>and a third</b> wall, which, based on a <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai, may measure <b>even</b> as little as one <b>handbreadth.

            "The Gemara explains: <b>The Rabbis hold that</b> the <b>tradition</b> of the manner in which the verses in are written <b>is authoritative.</b> The Torah states: “You shall reside <b>in <i>sukkot</i>”</b> (Leviticus 23:42) spelled deficient, without the letter <i>vav</i>, in a way that can be read in the singular. And later in that verse it also states: “All that are homeborn in Israel shall reside <b>in <i>sukkot</i>”</b> spelled the same way. And in the next verse it states: “So that your future generations will know that I caused the children of Israel to reside <b>in <i>sukkot</i>,”</b> this time spelled plene, with a <i>vav</i>, which means it must be plural. Therefore, <b>there are four</b> walls <b>here. Remove one verse,</b> which is needed <b>to</b> teach the mitzva to sit in a <i>sukka</i> <b>itself,</b> and <b>three</b> walls <b>remain. The <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai, which says that one of the walls may be incomplete, <b>comes</b> and <b>reduces the third and establishes it as</b> a minimum of one <b>handbreadth.</b>",
            "<b>And Rabbi Shimon holds</b> that the vocalization is authoritative. Since the verses state: “You shall reside <b>in <i>sukkot</i>,”</b> and: “All that are homeborn in Israel shall reside <b>in <i>sukkot</i>,”</b> and: “So that your future generations will know that I caused the children of Israel to reside <b>in <i>sukkot</i>,”</b> all of which are pronounced as plural nouns, <b>there are six</b> walls <b>here. Remove one verse to</b> teach the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> <b>itself,</b> and <b>four</b> walls <b>remain. The <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai then <b>comes</b> and <b>reduces the fourth</b> wall, <b>and establishes it at</b> a minimum of one <b>handbreadth.</b> Consequently, it is clear that Rabbi Shimon also holds that the vocalization is authoritative.",
            "With regard to <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> it is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is known that a quarter<i>-log</i> of blood that came from a corpse imparts ritual impurity in a tent.

As it is stated</b> with regard to a priest: <b>“He shall not come upon any dead bodies”</b> (Leviticus 21:11). The word “bodies” is pronounced as a plural word, and since the Torah teaches elsewhere that: “The blood is the life” (Deuteronomy 12:23), this indicates that impurity can be imparted by <b>one measure</b> of blood that came from <b>two bodies. And the Rabbis</b> say: The word <b>“bodies” is written</b> deficient, without a <i>vav</i>, so that it can also be read as a singular word, indicating that a quarter<i>-log</i> of blood imparts impurity in a tent only if it came from a single corpse.",
            "<b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov objects to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan’s assertion that all of the above disputes are based on the question of whether the traditional consonantal text or the vocalized text of the Torah is authoritative: <b>Is there</b> a Sage <b>who does not accept</b> the principle that the <b>vocalization</b> of the Torah <b>is authoritative?

            "With regard to <b>Beit Hillel,</b> who hold that a single presentation of blood is sufficient to atone even when bringing a sin-offering, this is not because they hold the traditional consonantal text is authoritative.

            "<b>Or</b> perhaps <b>go this way,</b> offering a different explanation: There <b>is stated</b> a term of <b>blood</b> in the verse written <b>with regard to the external</b> altar, i.e., in the verse written with regard to a sin-offering of an ordinary person that is brought on the external altar in the courtyard (see Leviticus 4:25), <b>and</b> there <b>is stated</b> a term of <b>blood</b> in the verse written <b>with regard to</b> the <b>inner</b> altar, i.e., with regard to a sin-offering of the community or the High Priest, the blood of which is sprinkled on the incense altar inside the Sanctuary (see Leviticus 4:7, 18). <b>Just as</b> with regard to the <b>blood that was stated concerning</b> the <b>inner</b> altar, i.e., if <b>one of the presentations is lacking it has not accomplished anything</b> and the offering is not valid, <b>so too,</b> with regard to the <b>blood that was stated concerning the external</b> altar, if one <b>of the presentations is lacking it has accomplished nothing.</b>",
            "The Gemara analyzes the two possibilities: <b>Let us see to which</b> of the two comparisons <b>this is</b> more <b>similar.</b> It can be claimed: <b>We derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> stated with regard to the <b>external</b> altar <b>from</b> a <i>halakha</i> stated with regard to the <b>external</b> altar, <b>but we do not derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> stated with regard to the <b>external</b> altar <b>from</b> a <i>halakha</i> stated with regard to the <b>inner</b> altar.",
            "<b>Or go this way: We derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> stated with regard to a <b>sin-offering</b> whose blood is to be sprinkled on the <b>four corners</b> of the altar <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> stated with regard to <b>a sin-offering</b> whose blood is to be sprinkled on the <b>four corners</b> of the altar, <b>and this</b> sin-offering consisting of a bird, <b>which is not a sin-offering</b> of the type whose blood is to be sprinkled on the <b>four corners</b> of the altar, <b>cannot prove</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is similar with regard to a sin-offering whose blood is to be sprinkled on the four corners of the altar.",
            "Since there are two legitimate inferences, the <i>halakha</i> cannot be decided through a logical inference.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> the words: <b>“Shall see”</b> and <b>“shall appear” are</b> written in <b>an identical</b> matter, <b>and</b> nevertheless the Sages <b>disagree</b> about which reading is authoritative. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Yoḥanan ben Dahavai says in the name of Rabbi Yehuda ben Teima: One who is blind in one of his eyes is exempt from the</b> mitzva of <b>appearance,</b> i.e., the obligation to appear in the Temple and to sacrifice an offering on the three pilgrimage Festivals, <b>as it is stated:</b> “Three times in the year all your males shall appear [<i>yera’eh</i>] before the Lord God” (Exodus 23:17). According to the way in which the verse is written, without vocalization, it can be read as <b><i>yireh</i>,</b> meaning: <b>Shall see,</b> instead of <b><i>yera’eh</i>,</b> meaning: <b>Shall appear.</b> This teaches that <b>in the</b> same <b>manner that one comes to see, so he comes to appear,</b> i.e., to be seen: <b>Just as</b> the usual way <b>to see</b> is <b>with both of one’s eyes, so too,</b> the obligation <b>to appear</b> applies only to one who comes <b>with</b> the sight of <b>both his eyes.</b>",
            "It is therefore apparent that even when there is no difference in the way the words are written, some say that the tradition, not the vocalization, is authoritative. <b>Rather, Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said:</b> The reason all agree that there is a prohibition to cook a young goat in its mother’s milk and not in its mother’s fat is that <b>the verse states: “You shall not cook a young goat”</b> (Exodus 23:19). The verse teaches that the action <b>the Torah prohibited</b> is in <b>the manner of cooking,</b> which is generally done in a liquid such as milk and not in a solid substance such as fat.",

            "Since the Gemara mentioned the importance of a judge receiving authorization from the Exilarch, it now discusses the scope of this authority.

And</b> it is also obvious that <b>from here to there,</b> relying on permission granted by the Exilarch to adjudicate cases within Eretz Yisrael, it <b>is also effective,</b> as the authority of the Exilarch is greater than that of the <i>Nasi</i>. This is so <b>since</b> the Exilarch <b>here</b> in Babylonia may be termed <b>a scepter,</b> i.e., a ruler with actual power of governance, <b>and</b> the <i>Nasi</i> <b>there</b> in Eretz Yisrael is only <b>a staff,</b> i.e., a legislator with limited power.",

Therefore, it seems that permission received in Eretz Yisrael is in fact effective in Babylonia. The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>He was</b> merely <b>standing up to them with words alone,</b> but there was no halakhic validity to his statement.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But since</b> permission to judge received in Eretz Yisrael <b>is not effective</b> in Babylonia, <b>why did Rabba bar Ḥana</b> need to <b>receive permission</b> when he left for Babylonia?

The Gemara answers: The permission is effective <b>for the cities that stand on the borders</b> of Babylonia, which are not entirely in the jurisdiction of Babylonia, so permission from Eretz Yisrael is effective there.",
            "§ <b>What</b> is the specific nature of this <b>permission?</b> The Gemara relates: <b>When Rabba bar Ḥana descended to Babylonia,</b> his uncle <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya said to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: <b>My brother’s son is descending to Babylonia.

But if it acquires a permanent blemish it is unfit for an offering, and it may be eaten. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi said to him: <b>He may declare</b> such an animal <b>permitted.</b>",

            "The Gemara rejects this answer. <b>But didn’t Rav say: I apprenticed with a shepherd</b> for <b>eighteen months</b> in order to be able <b>to know which</b> blemish is <b>a permanent blemish, and which</b> is <b>a temporary blemish?</b> Evidently, he had a high level of practical expertise in this matter. The Gemara explains: <b>Rather,</b> it was in order <b>to bestow honor upon Rabba bar Ḥana.</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi wanted to ensure that Rabba bar Ḥana would be treated with respect, so he made sure that there was an area of <i>halakha</i> with regard to which the people would not be able to consult with Rav and would need to consult with Rabba bar Ḥana instead.",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>It is due to this</b> fact <b>itself: Since Rav was a great expert with regard to blemishes, he</b> would <b>permit blemishes</b> that average <b>people do not know about.

Due to this concern, Rav was denied the authority to declare firstborn animals permitted on the basis of a blemish.",
            "With regard to the permission granted to Rabba bar Ḥana and Rav, the Gemara had related that Rabbi Ḥiyya asked Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: <b>May he teach</b> people and issue rulings concerning what is prohibited and what is permitted? And Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi responded: <b>He may teach.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If he had studied</b> and mastered the relevant <i>halakhot</i>, <b>why do I</b> need him <b>to receive permission?</b> The need for formal authority is understandable when it comes to serving on a court to judge cases of monetary law, but any knowledgeable person should be qualified to answer questions about ritual law. The Gemara explains: The need for such permission is <b>due to an incident that took place.</b>",
            "<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>once went to a certain place, and he saw people</b> there <b>kneading dough</b> while they were <b>in</b> a state of ritual <b>impurity,</b> and they believed that nevertheless, the dough remained ritually pure.

            "<b>Rather,</b> the judge must assure that <b>the</b> true <b>judgment will</b> prevail at all costs and metaphorically <b>pierce the mountain, as it is stated: “For the judgment is God’s”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:17). <b>And similarly, Moses would say: Let the judgment pierce the mountain. But</b> by contrast, <b>Aaron,</b> whose role was not that of a judge, was <b>a lover of peace and a pursuer of peace, and</b> he <b>would apply peace between</b> one <b>person and the other, as it is stated: “The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips; he walked with Me in peace and uprightness, and turned many away from iniquity”</b> (Malachi 2:6).",
            "The <i>Tosefta</i> cites several other interpretations of the above-mentioned verse from Psalms. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> If <b>one stole a <i>se’a</i> of wheat and ground it and baked it and separated <i>ḥalla</i> from it,</b> i.e., separated the portion of the dough that must be given to the priests, <b>how can he</b> possibly <b>recite the blessing</b> on the mitzva of <i>ḥalla</i>? <b>He is not blessing; rather,</b> he is <b>cursing</b> God. <b>And of this</b> offense <b>it is stated: “And the covetous [<i>uvotze’a</i>] blesses himself, though he despises the Lord,”</b> interpreted homiletically as: And whoever blesses upon breaking [<i>botze’a</i>] the bread despises the Lord.",
            "<b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> The term <b><i>botze’a</i></b> employed in that verse <b>was stated only with regard to Judah, as it is stated: “And Judah said to his brothers: What profit [<i>betza</i>] is it if we slay our brother</b> and conceal his blood? Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites” (Genesis 37:26–27). <b>And</b> consequently, <b>anyone who blesses Judah</b> for this act <b>is cursing</b> God, <b>and of this it is stated: “And the covetous [<i>uvotze’a</i>] blesses himself, though he despises the Lord,”</b> interpreted homiletically as: “And whoever blesses the profiteer [<i>botze’a</i>] despises the Lord.”",
            "<b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa says:</b> It is <b>a mitzva to mediate</b> a dispute, <b>as it is stated: “Execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates”</b> (Zechariah 8:16). <b>Is it not that in the place where there is</b> strict <b>judgment there is no</b> true <b>peace, and in a place where there is</b> true <b>peace, there is no</b> strict <b>judgment?

            "The Gemara cites an alternative interpretation of David’s method of judgment, in which <b>we come to</b> the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> i.e., Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who says that it is prohibited to mediate a dispute: If a judge <b>adjudicated</b> a case of monetary <b>law,</b> and he correctly <b>exonerated the</b> party who was <b>exempt</b> from payment <b>and deemed liable the</b> party who was <b>liable</b> to pay, if he then <b>saw that</b> due to his ruling <b>a poor person became liable</b> to pay an amount of <b>money</b> that is beyond his means <b>and</b> therefore the judge himself <b>paid for him from his</b> own <b>house, this is justice and</b> also <b>charity.</b>",
            "The Gemara continues: It is <b>justice for this</b> one <b>and charity for that</b> one: It is <b>justice for this</b> one, <b>because</b> the judge <b>restored</b> his <b>money to him; and</b> it is <b>charity for that</b> poor person, <b>because</b> the judge <b>paid for him from his</b> own <b>house. And similarly, with regard to David, it says: “And David executed justice and charity to all his people”</b> (II Samuel 8:15). He executed <b>justice for this</b> one, <b>because</b> he <b>restored his money to him, and charity for that</b> one, <b>because</b> he <b>paid for him from his</b> own <b>house.</b>",
            "This interpretation of the verse is <b>difficult for Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. If the word “charity” is meant to demonstrate that David supported the poor defendants, <b>this</b> term: <b>“To all his people,”</b> is incorrect. If the interpretation is correct, <b>it should have</b> stated: Charity <b>to the poor people. Rather, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: Although</b> he <b>did not pay from his</b> own <b>house, it is</b> still <b>justice and charity.</b> It is <b>justice for this</b> one <b>and charity for that</b> one. It is <b>justice for this</b> one, <b>because</b> the judge <b>restored his money to him, and charity for that</b> one, <b>because</b> the judge <b>removed</b> the <b>stolen item from his possession.</b> By adjudicating the case correctly and compelling the liable party to pay his debt, the judge thereby ensures that the liable party does not illegitimately maintain property to which he is not entitled.",

The verse is therefore interpreted not as: Aaron built an altar before the calf, but rather: He understood [<i>vayyaven</i>] from the slaughter [<i>mizavuaḥ</i>] before his own eyes; and he then called for a feast.",

According to Rabbi Yosei the case may be tried by three judges, because with regard to capital law, the two brothers invalidate the testimony merely by seeing the event together.",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: The mishna discusses a case <b>where others warned her, and</b> the <b>witnesses</b> themselves <b>did not warn her. And</b> Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis <b>disagree with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute between Rabbi Yosei and the Rabbis. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Makkot</i> 6b), <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> A defendant is <b>never executed unless the mouths of his two witnesses</b> are those who <b>warn him, as it is stated: “At the mouth of two witnesses,</b> or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall he that is to die be put to death” (Deuteronomy 17:6). The verse’s emphasis on the phrase “at the mouth of” teaches that the witnesses must issue the warning themselves. Rabbi Meir may agree with Rabbi Yosei that the woman cannot be executed if others gave the warning. Therefore the trial of the defamer needs only three judges, whereas the Rabbis in the mishna agree with the Rabbis in <i>Makkot</i> who disagree with Rabbi Yosei. Since she may be tried for adultery, the case requires twenty-three judges.",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead a different explanation: The mishna discusses a case <b>where</b> the testimony about the adultery <b>was found to be contradictory with regard to</b> the <b>examinations</b> concerning minor details of the incident, <b>but</b> the testimony <b>was not found to be contradictory with regard to</b> the <b>interrogations</b> concerning the time and place of the incident, which is the primary substance of the testimony.",
            "<b>And</b> Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis <b>disagree with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute between</b> Rabban Yoḥanan <b>ben Zakkai and the Rabbis. As we learned</b> in a mishna (40a): <b>An incident</b> occurred, <b>and</b> Rabban Yoḥanan <b>ben Zakkai examined</b> the witnesses <b>with regard to the stems of figs,</b> as to their color and shape, in order to expose a contradiction between the witnesses. When he found a discrepancy in their reports about the figs, he dismissed the testimony. Rabbi Meir adopts this opinion, and therefore a woman cannot be tried for adultery if the witnesses disagree about details like these. The Rabbis accept such testimony, and consequently, they require a court of twenty-three judges.",
            "§ The Gemara discusses scenarios concerning the testimony about a woman’s committing adultery and allegations that the husband is guilty of defamation. <b>Rav Yosef says:</b> If the <b>husband brought witnesses</b> who testified <b>that</b> his wife <b>committed adultery, and the</b> wife’s <b>father brought witnesses, and</b> they <b>testified that the husband’s witnesses were conspiring witnesses,</b> then <b>the husband’s witnesses are executed, but</b> they or their estates <b>do not pay money.</b> Although their testimony, if accepted, would also have lowered the value of her marriage contract, they do not incur liability, based on the principle that if someone commits a transgression that renders him liable to receive more than one punishment, he receives the greater punishment.",
            "If <b>the husband came back</b> before his witnesses were executed <b>and brought</b> new <b>witnesses, and</b> they <b>testified that the father’s witnesses were conspiring witnesses, the father’s witnesses are executed, and they</b> must also <b>pay money</b> to the husband, as they attempted to make him liable to pay the fine for defamation. They are not exempt from the payment because the <b>money</b> is <b>for this</b> victim, i.e., the husband, <b>and</b> their <b>lives</b> are <b>for that</b> set of witnesses, who would have been killed. Since their liability to receive the death penalty and their financial liability were caused by their offenses against different people, these are deemed separate transgressions, and consequently they receive both punishments.",
            "<b>And Rav Yosef</b> also <b>says,</b> with regard to distinguishing between the different aspects of a single testimony: If a man testifies that <b>so-and-so sodomized him against his will, he and another</b> witness may <b>combine</b> as a valid pair of witnesses <b>to kill</b> the defendant for the sin of homosexual sodomy (see Leviticus 18:22).",
            "But if the one who was sodomized testified that the accused sodomized him <b>with his consent,</b> he is testifying that <b>he</b> himself is <b>wicked,</b> having been complicit in the forbidden act, <b>and the Torah said: “Do not put</b> your hand with <b>a wicked</b> person to be an unrighteous <b>witness”</b> (Exodus 23:1). Therefore, the testimony is rejected. <b>Rava says: A person is his own relative and</b> therefore may not testify about himself. Therefore, <b>a person cannot render himself wicked</b> by his own testimony. As a result, he is deemed credible with regard to the sodomizer, but not with regard to himself. He remains a valid witness to convict the sodomizer in combination with another.",
            "And similarly, <b>Rava says:</b>"
        ],
        [
            "If someone testifies: <b>So-and-so engaged in intercourse with my wife, he and another</b> may <b>combine to execute him,</b> the accused man, with his testimony, <b>but</b> the woman’s husband is <b>not</b> accepted as a witness <b>to execute her.</b> A person cannot testify concerning his wife or any other close relative.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is this last scenario <b>teaching us?</b> Is it <b>that we divide the statement</b> of the witness in order to accept part of the testimony while rejecting the inadmissible part? This cannot be, as the principle in <b>this</b> case is identical to <b>that</b> case, in which the witness is not accepted to incriminate himself. The Gemara answers: The second case is necessary, <b>lest you say:</b> With regard to his own self, since <b>a person is his own relative, we say</b> that we divide the testimony. But <b>with regard to his wife,</b> one might think <b>we do not say</b> so, and the entire testimony must be either accepted or rejected. Therefore, the second case <b>teaches us</b> that even with regard to one’s wife, the statement is divided, and the testimony concerning his wife is disregarded.",
            "<b>And Rava</b> also <b>says:</b> If witnesses testify: <b>So-and-so engaged in intercourse with a betrothed young woman</b> (see Deuteronomy 22:25), without specifying the young woman in question, <b>and they were rendered conspiring witnesses, they are executed, and they are not</b> liable to <b>pay money.</b> Since they never specified the identity of the young woman, they were never in a position to cause anyone to lose part or all of her marriage contract. But if they specified: The young woman was <b>the daughter of so-and-so, and they are rendered conspiring witnesses, they are executed, and they</b> also <b>pay money.</b> Since in this case, the <b>money</b> is <b>for this</b> victim, i.e., the father of the young woman who stood to lose part or all of her marriage contract, <b>and</b> their <b>lives</b> are <b>for that</b> victim, i.e., the man and woman accused of adultery, they are liable to receive both punishments.",
            "<b>And Rava</b> also <b>says:</b> If they testify: <b>So-and-so engaged in bestiality with an ox</b> (see Leviticus 18:23), which would theoretically result in the execution of both the person and the animal, without specifying which ox, <b>and they were rendered conspiring witnesses, they are executed,</b> as their testimony would have put the accused to death, <b>and</b> yet <b>they are not</b> liable to <b>pay money</b> for the ox, because their testimony did not pertain to any ox in particular. But if they specify: He engaged in bestiality with <b>so-and-so’s ox, and they were rendered conspiring witnesses, they are executed, and they</b> also <b>pay money</b> to the owner of the ox they sought to have killed. Since the <b>money</b> is <b>for this</b> victim, the owner whose ox would have been killed by the court, <b>and</b> their <b>lives</b> are <b>for that</b> victim, the man accused of engaging in bestiality with an animal, they are liable to receive both punishments.",
            "The Gemara asks: It seems that the case of the ox exemplifies the same principle as the case of the betrothed young woman. <b>Why do I also</b> need <b>this</b> case? <b>This</b> is essentially identical to <b>that.</b> The Gemara answers: The second case was necessary to clarify a point, <b>because</b> Rava <b>raised a dilemma about it, as Rava raised a dilemma:</b> If someone testifies: <b>So-and-so engaged in bestiality with my ox, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say: A person is his own relative</b> concerning testimony, <b>but a person does not have the status of a relative with regard to his property,</b> and consequently the ox would also be executed because his testimony about his own animal is admissible? <b>Or perhaps we say: A person has the status of a relative with regard to his property,</b> and therefore his testimony about his ox is inadmissible? The Gemara says: <b>After</b> he <b>raised</b> the dilemma, <b>he then resolved it: A person is his own relative, but a person does not have the status of a relative with regard to his property,</b> so the ox is executed.",
            "§ The mishna teaches: Cases concerning one who is accused of violating a prohibition that would render him liable to receive <b>lashes</b> must be judged <b>by three</b> judges. The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Rav Huna says: The verse states:</b> “If there will be a controversy between men, and they come to judgment, and the judges judge them, and they shall justify the just, and they shall condemn the wicked. Then it shall be, if the wicked man deserves to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face” (Deuteronomy 25:1–2). When it states: <b>“And</b> the judges <b>judge them,”</b> in the plural, this indicates a minimum of <b>two</b> judges. <b>And</b> since <b>a court may not</b> be composed of <b>an even</b> number of judges, the court <b>adds to them one more,</b> and <b>there are</b> a total of <b>three</b> judges <b>here.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> that the plural verbs in the verse each indicate two judges, the term: <b>“And they shall justify,”</b> indicates another <b>two,</b> and the term: <b>“And they shall condemn,”</b> indicates another <b>two,</b> so that <b>there</b> are a total of <b>seven here.</b> The Gemara answers: Rav Huna <b>requires that</b> pair of terms <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Ulla, as Ulla says: From where in the Torah</b> is there <b>an allusion to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>conspiring witnesses?</b>",
            "The Gemara interrupts with a question: <b>An allusion to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>conspiring witnesses? But it is written</b> explicitly: “Then you shall do to him <b>as he had planned</b> to do to his brother” (Deuteronomy 19:19). Why would there be a need for an allusion? <b>Rather,</b> Ulla meant: <b>From where</b> in the Torah is there <b>an allusion to</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>conspiring witnesses are flogged?</b> Ulla answers: <b>As it is written: “And they shall justify the just, and they shall condemn the wicked.</b> Then it shall be, if the wicked man deserves to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face.”",
            "The Gemara explains the derivation: <b>Due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the terms in the verse: <b>“They shall justify the just, and they shall condemn the wicked”</b> indicate a financial dispute in which one party is vindicated and the other is required to pay, does it follow that, as the verse continues: <b>“Then it shall be, if the wicked man deserves to be beaten”?</b> Why would the verdict’s being rendered in the other party’s favor mean that the losing party is flogged? <b>Rather,</b> the verse must be discussing the witnesses and not the litigants. If conspiring <b>witnesses condemned the just</b> one, <b>and other witnesses came and justified the</b> one who was really <b>the just</b> one <b>from the beginning and rendered these</b> conspiring witnesses <b>wicked,</b> then, as the verse continues: <b>“Then it shall be, if the wicked man deserves to be beaten,</b> that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face.” This indicates that the witnesses are subject to lashes.",
            "The Gemara asks: Why does this <i>halakha</i> require a specific derivation? <b>But</b> since there is a principle that one is subject to lashes for violating any prohibition, why not <b>derive</b> this punishment <b>from</b> the prohibition: <b>“You shall not testify</b> as a false witness against your neighbor” (Exodus 20:13)? The Gemara answers: That verse is insufficient, <b>because it is a prohibition that does not involve an action,</b> but only speech, <b>and</b> with regard to <b>any prohibition that does not involve an action,</b> one <b>is not flogged for it.</b>",
            "§ The mishna teaches: It <b>was stated in the name of Rabbi Yishmael:</b> Cases concerning lashes must be adjudicated <b>by twenty-three</b> judges. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yishmael?

            "<b>Rava says:</b> A verbal analogy is unnecessary. Conceptually, <b>lashes stand in place of execution.</b> As corporal punishment is a kind of replacement for capital punishment, it must be judged in the manner of capital punishments, by a court of twenty-three. <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: If so,</b> that lashes stand in place of execution, <b>why do I</b> need <b>an assessment?</b> Before administering lashes, the court consults with a physician to assess how many lashes the transgressor can withstand and adjusts the number of lashes so that the transgressor’s life will not be threatened.

            "§ Since Shmuel HaKatan and his great piety were mentioned, the Gemara now relates several incidents that shed additional light on his personality. <b>The Sages taught: After the last of the prophets, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi, died, the Divine Spirit</b> of prophetic revelation <b>departed from the Jewish people. But nevertheless, they were</b> still <b>utilizing a Divine Voice,</b> which they heard as a kind of echo of prophecy. <b>One time,</b> a group of Sages <b>were reclining in the loft of the house of Gurya in Jericho, and a Divine Voice was bestowed upon them from Heaven,</b> saying: <b>There is one here who is fit for the Divine Presence to rest upon him as</b> it rested upon <b>Moses our teacher, but his generation is not deserving of this</b> distinction. <b>The Sages set their eyes upon Hillel the Elder,</b> trusting that he was the one indicated by the Divine Voice. <b>And when he died,</b> the Sages <b>said about him: Alas,</b> the <b>pious</b> man, <b>alas,</b> the <b>humble</b> man, <b>a disciple of Ezra.</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Another time,</b> a group of Sages <b>were reclining in the loft in Yavne, and a Divine Voice was bestowed upon them from Heaven,</b> saying: <b>There is one here who is fit for the Divine Presence to rest upon him</b> in prophecy, <b>but his generation is not deserving of this</b> distinction. <b>The Sages set their eyes upon Shmuel HaKatan.

            "§ The Gemara returns to the discussion about intercalation of the year. <b>The Sages taught: The year</b> may be <b>intercalated only if the <i>Nasi</i></b> of the Sanhedrin <b>wants</b> to intercalate it. <b>And</b> there was once <b>an incident involving Rabban Gamliel, who went to ask permission</b> for some communal matter <b>from an officer [<i>hegmon</i>] in Syria, and</b> he <b>tarried in returning</b> until after it was too late to intercalate the year. <b>And</b> because they did not know what his opinion on the matter was, they <b>intercalated the year on the condition that Rabban Gamliel would want</b> to do so. <b>And when Rabban Gamliel came</b> back <b>and said: I want</b> to intercalate the year, <b>the year was found</b> to be retroactively <b>intercalated.</b>",
            "<b>The Sages taught: The year</b> may be <b>intercalated only if it is necessary due to</b> damage to <b>the roads,</b> if the rain has damaged them in such a way that they are inaccessible for those ascending to Jerusalem for Passover; <b>or due to the bridges</b> that are likewise in disrepair; <b>or due to the ovens</b> for the <b>Paschal offerings</b> that are damaged and unfit for roasting the offerings; <b>or due to the Diaspora Jews who have left their homes and still have not arrived</b> due to delays in travel. <b>But</b> the year may <b>not</b> be intercalated <b>due to the snow, and not due to the cold, and not due to the Diaspora Jews who have not</b> yet <b>left from their homes,</b> even if they no longer have enough time to reach Jerusalem for the Festival.",
            "<b>The Sages taught: The year may not</b> be <b>intercalated due to the young goats and not due to the lambs,</b> to allow them to grow larger before they are to be sacrificed as Paschal offerings; <b>and not due to the fledgling</b> doves <b>who have not</b> yet developed sufficiently to <b>fly,</b> so that there won’t be enough of them to supply all those who wish to bring bird offerings at the Festival. <b>But</b> all <b>these</b> considerations may be <b>made supporting</b> factors in the decision <b>to</b> intercalate <b>the year.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>How</b> so? <b>Rabbi Yannai says in the name of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel,</b> i.e., this is the language Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel used in his declaration of the intercalation: <b>We are notifying you that the fledglings are tender, and that the lambs are thin [<i>de’arkin</i>], and time for the spring has not</b> yet <b>arrived. And</b> consequently, <b>the matter is good in my eyes, and I have</b> therefore <b>added thirty days onto this year.</b>",
            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the report that Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds the intercalated month is thirty days long. It is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How long is</b> the additional month in <b>an intercalated</b> leap <b>year?</b> The Rabbis say: <b>Thirty days. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> A standard <b>month,</b> which is twenty-nine days long.

            "<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says</b> that this principle can be demonstrated based on an incident related in the Bible. The verse states with regard to the prophet Elisha: <b>“And there came a man from Ba’al Shalisha, and he brought to the man of God bread of the first fruits, twenty loaves of barley,</b> and fresh ears of corn in his sack. And he said: Give to the people, that they may eat” (II Kings 4:42).",
            "The incident is analyzed: <b>You do not have in all of Eretz Yisrael</b> an environment in which <b>fruit ripens more swiftly than</b> in <b>Ba’al Shalisha, and even so, only one</b> of the seven <b>species</b> had <b>ripened</b> at that time, as the verse testifies that he brought him “bread of the first fruits.” <b>Lest you say</b> the verse speaks of <b>wheat,</b> which ripens close to the time of the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>the verse states “barley.” Lest you say</b> that the incident took place <b>before the <i>omer</i></b> offering was sacrificed, <b>the verse states: “Give to the people, that they may eat.”</b> As they were permitted to eat, it must be that the incident <b>was after the <i>omer</i></b> offering was brought.",
            "<b>Based on this, say</b> that even in the place in which fruit ripened the fastest in all of Eretz Yisrael, after the <i>omer</i> had been brought, only the barley had ripened. Evidently, <b>the year was fit to be intercalated,</b> because the spring produce was not sufficiently mature in time. <b>And for what</b> reason <b>did</b> the prophet <b>Elisha not intercalate it?

            "The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so,</b> that intercalation may be determined only after Rosh HaShana? <b>But</b> the Sages of Eretz Yisrael <b>sent</b> the following encoded message <b>to Rava</b> during the time of Roman persecution: <b>A pair</b> of Torah scholars <b>came from Rakkath,</b> the biblical name for Tiberias (see Joshua 19:35), which was the seat of the Sanhedrin in Rava’s time.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> meaning if this is the correct way to understand the <i>Tosefta</i>, then the next statement in the <i>Tosefta</i> cannot be reconciled: <b>Rabbi Shimon says: If</b> they <b>intercalated</b> the year <b>due to ritual impurity,</b> it is indeed <b>intercalated.</b> According to this explanation, <b>this is</b> identical to the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> who also says that the intercalation is effective. <b>Rava said:</b> The difference <b>between</b> these two opinions is whether the year may be intercalated due to impurity <b><i>ab initio</i>.</b> According to the first <i>tanna</i>, although the intercalation is valid after the fact, impurity is not an appropriate reason to intercalate the year.

If an ox did ascend the mountain, how many judges would be necessary to sentence it to execution by stoning? The Gemara explains the question: <b>Do</b> we <b>derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> that applies only to a specific <b>time from</b> a <i>halakha</i> that applies for all <b>generations,</b> and accordingly any animal that is to be stoned is judged by twenty-three judges; <b>or not?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution from <b>that</b> which <b>Rami bar Yeḥezkel taught:</b> The verse states: <b>“Whether animal or man it shall not live.”</b> The comparison serves to teach that <b>just as a person</b> is judged <b>by twenty-three</b> judges, <b>so too an animal</b> is judged <b>by twenty-three</b> judges.",

            "§ The mishna states that <b>a city may be designated</b> as <b>an idolatrous city</b> only in accordance with the ruling of the Great Sanhedrin, consisting of seventy-one judges. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef says</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya says: As the verse states</b> with regard to one who engages in idol worship: <b>“And you shall take out that man or that woman</b> who did that evil thing to your gates” (Deuteronomy 17:5), and it is inferred: <b>You take out a man or a woman to your gates</b> for the lesser Sanhedrin to judge them, <b>but you do not take out the entire city to your gates;</b> rather, they are to be judged by the Great Sanhedrin.",
            "§ The mishna teaches that the court <b>may not designate</b> a city as <b>an idolatrous city</b> if it is <b>on the frontier.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The Gemara answers: The verse states: “Certain worthless people have gone out from your midst and have led astray the inhabitants of their city” (Deuteronomy 13:14). <b>The Merciful One states</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies when they come <b>from your midst,</b> meaning from within your country, <b>but not from the frontier.</b>",
            "§ The mishna teaches: <b>And three</b> adjoining cities may <b>not</b> be designated as <b>idolatrous cities.</b> The source for this ruling is <b>as it is written:</b> “If you shall hear concerning <b>one</b> of your cities that the Lord your God has given you” (Deuteronomy 13:13), and not three cities. The mishna continues: <b>But</b> the court <b>may designate one</b> city, <b>or two</b> adjoining cities as idolatrous cities.

            "<b>At times Rav said: It is in one court that they may not designate</b> more than two adjoining cities as idolatrous cities, <b>but in two or three courts they may designate</b> them. <b>And at times Rav said: Even in two or three courts they may never designate</b> them. <b>What is the reasoning of Rav?</b> It is <b>due to desolation,</b> to ensure there will not be large swaths of uninhabited land in Eretz Yisrael. <b>Reish Lakish says: They taught only</b> that the court may not designate three adjoining cities as idolatrous cities <b>in one region, but in two or three regions they may designate</b> them. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: They may not designate</b> them, <b>due to desolation.</b>",
            "The Gemara comments: It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 14:1) <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> The court <b>may not designate three</b> adjoining <b>cities</b> as <b>idolatrous</b> cities <b>in Eretz Yisrael, but they may designate two, such as one in Judea and one in the Galilee.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> let <b>him derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> from the fact <b>that the Merciful One states: “From your midst,”</b> from which it is inferred: <b>But not from the frontier.</b> The Gemara answers: This <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, as he interprets the reason</b> for the mitzva <b>in the verse</b> and draws halakhic conclusions based on that interpretation.",
            "§ The mishna teaches that <b>the Great Sanhedrin was</b> composed of seventy-one judges, and that Rabbi Yehuda holds that it was composed of only seventy, as Moses gathered seventy men of the Elders of the Jewish people, and according to Rabbi Yehuda, Moses himself was not counted as part of the group. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of the Rabbis, who say</b> that when <b>Moses</b> gathered seventy men, he was <b>at the head of</b> the court and is therefore counted among them? <b>The verse states:</b> “And the Lord said to Moses: Gather Me seventy men from the Elders of Israel, whom you know to be the Elders of the people and officers over them, and bring them to the Tent of Meeting <b>and they shall stand there</b>"

According to Rabbi Yehuda, Moses was instructed to remain with the seventy Elders in order for the Divine Presence to rest upon them as well.

And</b> how would <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> respond to that? He would explain that the term <b>“with you”</b> means <b>similar to you,</b> meaning, that the Elders appointed to the court had to be of fit lineage and free of blemish, like Moses.",

            "§ Apropos the appointment of the Elders by Moses, the Gemara discusses additional aspects of that event. There were seventy-two candidates for Elder but only seventy were needed.

Where did they remain? <b>Some say</b> this means <b>they,</b> i.e., their names, <b>remained</b> excluded from those selected from the lots <b>in the box.</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>At the time that the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Moses: “Gather for Me seventy men of the Elders of Israel”</b> (Numbers 11:16), <b>Moses said: How shall I do</b> it?

            "The Gemara comments: <b>You</b> can <b>say</b> something <b>similar to this</b> to explain the verse about the redemption of the firstborn by the Levites: “Take the Levites in place of all of the firstborn of the children of Israel…and as for the redemption of the 273 of the firstborn of the children of Israel who are in excess over the number of the Levites…<b>you shall take five shekels per head”</b> (Numbers 3:45–47).

            "<b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> Eldad and Medad <b>remained in the camp,</b> as they did not want to come to the lottery for the Elders. <b>At the time that the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Moses: Gather for me seventy Elders, Eldad and Medad said: We are not fitting for that</b> level of <b>greatness;</b> we are not worthy of being appointed among the Elders. <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said: Since you have made yourselves humble, I will add greatness to your greatness.

            "Apropos Eldad and Medad being prophets, the Gemara asks: <b>And what prophecy did they prophesy?

            "<b>Rav Naḥman says: They were prophesying about the matter of Gog and Magog, as it is stated</b> with regard to Gog and Magog: <b>“So says the Lord God: Are you the one of whom I spoke in ancient days, through my servants, the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in those days for many years [<i>shanim</i>] that I would bring you against them?”</b> (Ezekiel 38:17). <b>Do not read</b> it as: <b>“Years [<i>shanim</i>]”; rather,</b> read it as: <b>Two [<i>shenayim</i>].

            "<b>The Master says:</b> The <i>baraita</i> said: <b>All of the prophets prophesied and</b> then <b>stopped, but</b> Eldad and Medad <b>prophesied and did not stop.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> the other prophets <b>stopped</b> prophesying? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>from that which is written</b> about them: <b>“And they prophesied but they did so no more [<i>velo yasafu</i>]”</b> (Numbers 11:25), that is difficult: <b>But if that is so,</b> then concerning that which is stated in relation to the giving of the Torah: “These words the Lord spoke to all your assembly…with <b>a great voice, and it went on no more [<i>velo yasaf</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:19), <b>so too</b> shall it be understood <b>that</b> the great voice <b>did not continue? Rather,</b> the intention there is <b>that it did not stop,</b> interpreting the word <i>yasafu</i> as related to <i>sof</i>, meaning: End. Consequently, with regard to the seventy Elders as well, the word can be interpreted to mean that they did not stop prophesying.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the proof is as follows: <b>It is written here</b> with regard to the seventy Elders: <b>“They prophesied”</b> (Numbers 11:25), and <b>it is written there:</b> “Eldad and Medad <b>are prophesying</b> in the camp” (Numbers 11:27), from which it can be derived that <b>they were continuously prophesying.</b>",
            "With regard to the content of Eldad and Medad’s prophecy, the Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> their prophecy was that <b>Moses will die, this is</b> the reason for that <b>which is written</b> there: “And Joshua, son of Nun, the servant of Moses from his youth, answered and said: <b>My master Moses, imprison them”</b> (Numbers 11:28), as their prophecy appeared to be a rebellion against Moses. <b>But according to the one who says those</b> other <b>two</b> opinions with regard to the content of the prophecy, according to which their prophecy had no connection to Moses, <b>what</b> is the reason that Joshua said: <b>“My master Moses, imprison them”?</b> The Gemara answers: He said this <b>because</b> it is <b>not proper conduct</b> for them to prophesy publicly in close proximity to Moses, <b>as</b> by doing so <b>they are like a student who teaches a <i>halakha</i> in his teacher’s presence,</b> which is inappropriate.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the one who says those</b> other <b>two</b> opinions, <b>this is</b> the reason for that <b>which is written:</b> “And Moses said to him: Are you jealous for my sake? <b>Would</b> that all of the Lord’s people were prophets” (Numbers 11:29). <b>But according to the one who says</b> that Eldad and Medad prophesied that <b>Moses will die</b> and Joshua will bring Israel into the land, <b>would it have been satisfactory to Moses</b> that all of the people of God would utter similar prophecies?

            "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>“Imprison them [<i>kela’em</i>]”?</b> The Gemara answers: Joshua <b>said to him: Place</b> responsibility for the <b>needs of the public upon them,</b> so that they will be occupied like the other Elders of Israel <b>and they will cease [<i>kalin</i>]</b> prophesying, <b>on their own.</b> Due to the burden of public responsibility they would not be able to be prophets.",
            "§ The mishna derives the <i>halakha</i> that there are twenty-three judges on a lesser Sanhedrin from the verses: “And the congregation shall judge,” and: “And the congregation shall save” (Numbers 35:24–25). The mishna understands that the term “congregation” is referring to ten judges, so that the two congregations, one in each verse, total twenty judges. The mishna then asks: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>to bring three more</b> judges to the court? The mishna answers: The implication of the verse: “You shall not follow a multitude to convict” (Exodus 23:2), is that your inclination after a majority to exonerate is not like your inclination after a majority to convict, and a conviction must be by a majority of two.",
            "The Gemara objects: <b>Ultimately, you do not find</b> an occurrence of the inclination <b>for evil according to</b> a majority of <b>two</b> judges. <b>If eleven</b> judges vote to <b>acquit</b> the defendant <b>and twelve</b> vote to <b>convict, this is still</b> only a majority of <b>one,</b> and <b>if ten</b> vote to <b>acquit and thirteen</b> vote to <b>convict, they are</b> a majority of <b>three.</b> With a court of twenty-three judges, there is no possible way to convict with a majority of two. <b>Rabbi Abbahu says: You do not find</b> such a scenario <b>except</b> in a case <b>where they add</b> two additional judges because one of the judges abstained from the deliberation, the other judges are split in their decisions, and the two added judges both vote to convict. <b>And</b> this is a possibility <b>according to</b> all <i>tanna’im</i>, <b>and in</b> a case tried by <b>the Great Sanhedrin according to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> there are <b>seventy</b> judges on the Great Sanhedrin.

            "<b>And Rabbi Abbahu says: When they add</b> additional judges, they <b>create a court</b> consisting of <b>an even</b> number of judges <b><i>ab initio</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious?</b> What is the novelty in Rabbi Abbahu’s statement? The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say: This</b> judge <b>who says: I do not know, is</b> viewed <b>as one who is</b> still <b>there, and if he says something</b> afterward, <b>we listen to him</b> and include him in the count, so there are actually an odd number of judges on the court; therefore, Rabbi Abbahu <b>teaches us that this</b> judge <b>who says: I do not know, is</b> viewed <b>as one who is not</b> still <b>there, and if he says a reason</b> to rule in a certain manner afterward, <b>we do not listen to him.</b> Consequently, the court consists of an even number of judges.",

It is <b>since</b> it <b>is learned</b> as a tradition that <b>suspension of the trial</b> overnight is necessary in order <b>to create</b> a possibility of <b>acquittal.</b> The <i>halakha</i> is that they may not issue the guilty verdict on the same day the evidence was heard, as perhaps over the course of the night one of the judges will think of a reason to acquit the defendant. <b>And</b> as <b>those</b> judges all saw fit to convict him they <b>will not see</b> any <b>further</b> possibility to acquit <b>him,</b> because there will not be anyone arguing for such a verdict.

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that Rabbi Yehuda interprets the rationale</b> behind the mitzva <b>in the verse</b> and draws halakhic conclusions based on that interpretation, <b>and Rabbi Shimon does not interpret the rationale in the verse?

            "<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 10:3): In the case of <b>a widow, whether she is poor or whether she is wealthy, one may not take collateral from her</b> for a loan, <b>as it is stated: “You may not take the garment of a widow for a pledge”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:17); this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.

            "<b>And we say</b> about this dispute: <b>What is</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>saying?

            "The Gemara explains: <b>Generally, Rabbi Yehuda does not interpret the rationale in the verse, but it is different here, as</b> the verse itself <b>explains the rationale in the verse: What is the reason</b> that <b>“he shall not add many wives for himself”?</b> He should not add many wives <b>because of</b> what is articulated in the continuation of the verse: <b>“His heart should not turn.”</b>",
            "<b>And Rabbi Shimon</b> could have <b>said to you: Since generally we interpret the rationale in the verse,</b> then <b>if</b> it is <b>so</b> that the prohibition against marrying many wives applies only to wives that are likely to lead his heart astray, <b>the verse should write</b> only: <b>“He shall not add many wives for himself” and</b> then <b>be silent.</b> In that case, <b>I would say,</b> on my own, <b>what is the reason</b> that <b>he shall not add many</b> wives?

            "The Gemara questions this ruling: The specific <b>reason</b> for limiting the prohibition to personal wealth accumulation is <b>that the Merciful One writes:</b> “Neither shall he greatly accumulate silver and gold <b>for himself,”</b> which indicates, <b>consequently,</b> that if the Torah had <b>not</b> written <b>this, I would say</b> that it <b>is not</b> permitted for the king to accumulate <b>even enough</b> silver and gold <b>to provide</b> his <b>soldiers’ sustenance;</b> this is unreasonable, since the king needs an army. The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> the term “for himself” is <b>necessary</b> to teach that the king is permitted <b>to</b> allow for <b>a liberal appropriation</b> to the military budget, so that the army has a comfortable financial cushion.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Now that you have said</b> that the term <b>“for himself”</b> in the verse is stated <b>for</b> the purpose of <b>a derivation</b> for practical <i>halakha</i>, which limits and narrows the verse’s scope, <b>what do you derive from</b> the next phrase in the verse: <b>“He shall not add many wives for himself”?</b> The Gemara answers: That usage of “for himself” serves <b>to exclude ordinary</b> people, to specify that only the king is restricted from having many wives, but a civilian may marry as many women as he wants, provided he can support them financially.",

            "<b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak says: For what</b> reason <b>were the rationales of Torah</b> commandments <b>not revealed?</b> It was <b>because the rationales of two verses were revealed,</b> and <b>the greatest in the world,</b> King Solomon, <b>failed in</b> those matters. <b>It is written</b> with regard to a king: <b>“He shall not add many wives for himself,</b> that his heart should not turn away” (Deuteronomy 17:17). <b>Solomon said: I will add many, but I will not turn away,</b> as he thought that it is permitted to have many wives if one is otherwise meticulous not to stray. <b>And</b> later, <b>it is written: “For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart</b> after other gods” (I Kings 11:4).",

The Gemara concludes <b>by inference that</b> if Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi is singled out as a lone opinion, then <b>the Rabbis prohibit</b> it.",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>There,</b> with regard to drinking wine, <b>this is the reason</b> for the prohibition: <b>The Temple will speedily be built, and we need a priest who is fit for the</b> Temple <b>service; and</b> if the priests drink wine <b>there are none.</b> Therefore, none of them may drink wine.

            "§ The mishna teaches that <b>one who lends</b> money <b>with interest</b> is disqualified from bearing witness. <b>Rava says: One who borrows</b> money <b>with interest is disqualified from bearing witness.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that specifically <b>one who lends</b> money <b>with interest</b> is disqualified?

            "The Gemara recounts: <b>Two witnesses testified about bar Binittos.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t Rava the one who said</b> that <b>one who borrows</b> money <b>with interest is disqualified from bearing witness?

            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rava</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as Rava says: A person is his own relative and a person cannot make himself wicked.</b> Consequently, the part of the testimony that relates to the witness’s own status is not accepted, while the part that relates to bar Binittos is accepted.",
            "There was <b>a certain slaughterer about whom it was discovered that</b> a <i>tereifa,</i> <b>an animal with a wound that would have caused it to die within twelve months, emerged from his possession.</b> In other words, he sold <i>tereifa</i> meat without informing the customers of its status. <b>Rav Naḥman disqualified him</b> from bearing witness <b>and removed him</b> from his position as a slaughterer. The slaughterer subsequently <b>went</b> and <b>grew his fingernails and his hair</b> out of remorse over his actions. <b>Rav Naḥman thought to deem him fit</b> again for bearing witness, as he clearly repented, and once someone repents for his sin, his status as a valid witness is restored.",

            "§ Among the list of those who are disqualified from bearing witness the mishna teaches: <b>And those who fly pigeons.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is meant by: <b>Those who fly pigeons?

            "The Gemara answers: He could <b>say to you</b> that <b>an <i>ara</i></b> is not considered a robber, as the pigeons that he has his pigeons bring do not actually belong to those from whom he takes them.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> the <i>baraita</i> states this <b>with regard to the wild ox,</b> which can be lured away from its owner’s property because it is not a completely domesticated animal. <b>And</b> the <i>baraita</i> states this <b>according to the one who says</b> that <b>the wild ox is a species of domesticated animal, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 8:6): <b>The wild ox is a species of domesticated animal.</b> But <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> It is <b>a species of undomesticated animal.</b>",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>A robber is</b> disqualified <b>by Torah law;</b> why is it necessary for the Sages to add such an individual to the list? The Gemara answers: It <b>is necessary only to</b> add one who steals <b>an item found by a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor,</b> who acquire those items by rabbinic law only (see <i>Gittin</i> 59b). Since these people are not considered halakhically competent, by Torah law they do not acquire an item that they find, and consequently one who steals such an item from them is not in violation of a prohibition by Torah law.",
            "One possibility is that taking such an item is prohibited by rabbinic law because it constitutes robbery. Nevertheless, <b>initially</b> the Sages did not disqualify such an individual from bearing witness, as they <b>assumed</b> that the case of <b>an item found by a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor is uncommon.</b> Therefore, it was not deemed necessary to disqualify one who robs them of such an item. <b>Alternatively,</b> the Sages may have reasoned that taking such an item is prohibited <b>merely on account of the ways of peace,</b> i.e., to foster peace and prevent strife and controversy, and is not considered actual robbery. <b>When they realized that ultimately</b> these people <b>were taking property</b> from others and were likely to perform actual robbery, <b>the Sages disqualified them.</b>",
            "Similarly, with regard to <b>those who force transactions, initially</b> the Sages did not disqualify them, as <b>they assumed</b> that their behavior could be excused for two reasons: <b>They would pay money</b> for the items they took, and their forcing transactions <b>was merely occasional;</b> it was not a common practice. <b>When they realized that</b> these people <b>were snatching</b> items regularly, <b>the Sages issued a decree that they</b> are disqualified from bearing witness.",
            "§ It is <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Sages <b>further added</b> the following <b>to</b> the list of those disqualified from bearing witness: <b>The shepherds,</b> who shepherd their animals in the fields of others and are therefore considered like robbers; <b>the collectors</b> of government taxes, who collect more than the amount that people are legally liable to pay; <b>and the customs officials,</b> who collect customs in an illegal manner.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>Shepherds</b> were not disqualified at first, as the Sages <b>initially assumed it was merely incidental</b> that they would let their animals graze in the fields of others. <b>When they realized that they would intentionally send</b> the animals to the fields of others <b>from the outset, the Sages issued a decree that they</b> are disqualified from bearing witness. <b>The collectors</b> of taxes <b>and the customs officials</b> were not disqualified at first, as the Sages <b>initially assumed they would take the set amount they</b> were instructed to take. <b>When they realized that</b> these officials <b>were taking more</b> than that, <b>they disqualified them.</b>",

By contrast, <b>herders of large livestock, even in Eretz Yisrael, are fit</b> to bear witness. The Gemara answers: <b>That was stated with regard to</b> those <b>who raise</b> their animals on their own land, without herding them on land in the public domain.",
            "The Gemara suggests a proof for Rava’s opinion that a herder of large livestock is also disqualified: <b>This too stands to reason, from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the mishna (24a) <b>teaches</b> that a litigant may state: <b>Three cattle herders are trusted for me</b> in court; by inference, cattle herders are generally disqualified. <b>What, is it not with regard to bearing witness</b> that cattle herders are disqualified, in accordance with Rava’s statement?",
            "The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>No,</b> it is <b>with regard to</b> sitting in <b>judgment.</b> The Gemara comments: The language of the mishna <b>is also precise</b> according to this interpretation, <b>as it teaches: Three cattle herders</b> are trusted for me. <b>And if</b> it is <b>with regard to bearing witness, why do I</b> need <b>three</b> witnesses? Two are enough.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But rather,</b> with regard to <b>what</b> are cattle herders disqualified?

            "The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying:</b> The litigants can accept as judges <b>even those</b> cattle herders <b>who</b> dwell in the fields and <b>do not frequent the settled area,</b> and are therefore not proficient in the ways of business.",
            "<b>Rav Yehuda says: An ordinary shepherd</b> is <b>disqualified</b> from bearing witness unless the court recognizes him as one who does not let his animals graze in the fields of others. <b>An ordinary</b> tax <b>collector</b> is <b>fit</b> unless the court determines he is one who collects more than people are obligated to pay.",
            "The Gemara relates a story about a tax collector: <b>The father of Rabbi Zeira collected</b> taxes for <b>thirteen years.

He said this so that the head tax collector would not see the rabbis, and it would be possible to lower the taxes of the city. <b>When he would see</b> the ordinary <b>people of the city, he would say</b> to them: Beware, as <b>the head</b> tax collector of the <b>river</b> region <b>is coming to the city, and will now slaughter the father,</b> i.e., take one’s money, <b>before the son, and the son before the father.</b>"

            "<b>When he was dying, he said to</b> those standing around his deathbed: <b>Take thirteen <i>ma’a</i> that are tied up in my sheet and return them to so-and-so, as I took them from him but I did not need them</b> to pay the tax. Evidently, some tax collectors are God-fearing, and should not be disqualified.",
            "§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Shimon said: Initially</b> people <b>would call them: Gatherers</b> of the produce <b>of the Sabbatical</b> Year. Once the tax collectors grew abundant they would then call them: Merchants who trade in the produce of the Sabbatical Year.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is he saying?</b> What is Rabbi Shimon teaching in this statement? <b>Rav Yehuda says this</b> is what <b>he is saying: Initially</b> the Sages <b>would say</b> that <b>gatherers</b> of the produce <b>of</b> the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year, i.e., those who gather a large quantity of produce of the Sabbatical Year for themselves, <b>are fit</b> to bear witness, but <b>merchants</b> who trade in the produce of the Sabbatical Year are <b>disqualified.</b>",
            "<b>Once those who would offer money to the poor</b> to gather produce for them <b>grew abundant, and the poor would go and gather</b> the produce <b>for</b> those who hired them <b>and bring</b> it to them, then gathering a large amount of produce of the Sabbatical Year was considered a business.

            "Reish Lakish <b>saw a certain man plowing</b> a field. <b>He said to</b> the other Sages: Look at this <b>priest</b> who is <b>plowing</b> during the Sabbatical Year. <b>They said to him</b> that he <b>could say</b> in his own defense: <b>I am a hired worker [<i>agiston</i>] in</b> the field, which belongs to a gentile. Therefore, it is permitted.",
            "Reish Lakish <b>further saw a certain man pruning</b> vines <b>in</b> the <b>vineyards.

Since he is not pruning the vines for agricultural purposes but to use the branches, it is permitted for him to do so in the Sabbatical Year.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>Which did he say to them first?</b> Which incident occurred first? <b>If we say</b> that <b>first he said to them that first</b> exclamation, that a priest was plowing the field, <b>let them say</b> to him in <b>this</b> latter incident <b>too,</b> in which someone was pruning vines, that he could claim in his defense: <b>I am a hired worker in</b> the field. This would have been a better justification than claiming he needed the branches. <b>Rather,</b> apparently <b>first he said to them this</b> exclamation, that a priest was pruning vines, <b>and</b> only <b>then he said to them that</b> a priest was plowing the field.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>a priest?</b> Why did Reish Lakish assume the man was a priest? The Gemara answers: It is <b>because</b> priests <b>are suspected of</b> desecrating the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year.",
            "<b>As we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A <i>se’a</i> of <i>teruma</i>,</b> the portion of the produce designated for the priest, <b>that fell into a hundred <i>se’a</i> of Sabbatical</b> Year produce and was indistinguishable, <b>is nullified,</b> i.e., it no longer has the status of <i>teruma</i>, and can be eaten until the time that Sabbatical Year produce must be removed from one’s possession. If it fell into <b>a lesser</b> quantity of Sabbatical Year produce, the entire mixture <b>must</b> be left to <b>rot,</b> as it is prohibited for non-priests to partake of <i>teruma</i>.",
            "<b>And we discussed it: Why must</b> the produce <b>rot? Let</b> its owner <b>sell it to a priest in accordance with</b> its <b>value as <i>teruma</i>,</b> which is less expensive than regular produce because it can be eaten only by priests, and <b>except for the value of that <i>se’a</i></b> of <i>teruma</i> that fell in, which the owner is required to give to a priest for free. The priest may then partake of the produce, treating the entire mixture as though it has the sanctity of <i>teruma</i>, and both the priest and the owner will benefit.",
            "<b>And Rav Ḥiyya said in the name of Ulla: That is to say,</b> i.e., one can infer from the fact that one is not permitted to sell the mixture to a priest, that <b>priests are suspected of</b> desecrating <b>the Sabbatical</b> Year by partaking of its produce after the time it must be removed from one’s possession. They did so because they considered it theirs, the same as <i>teruma</i>, as both mitzvot pertain to the produce of Eretz Yisrael. Therefore, produce of the Sabbatical Year should not be given or sold to priests. Similarly, Reish Lakish assumed that those who desecrated the Sabbatical Year were priests.",
            "After Reish Lakish continually bothered them with his comments, Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Zarnokei and Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak <b>said: This one is a nuisance.</b> In order to rid themselves of him, <b>when they reached</b> the location where they intended to intercalate the year, <b>they went up to the roof</b> and <b>took the ladder out from under them</b> so that he would stay below and would not be able to join them.",
            "Sometime later, Reish Lakish <b>came before Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b> Reish Lakish <b>said to him:</b> Are <b>people who are suspected of</b> desecrating <b>the Sabbatical</b> Year <b>fit to intercalate the year?</b> He believed that the two Sages who were sent to intercalate the year treated the sanctity of the Sabbatical Year with disrespect.",
            "Reish Lakish <b>then said</b> in response to his own question: This is <b>not difficult for me; just as</b> the Sages once intercalated the year in accordance with the assessment of <b>three cattle herders</b> (see 18b), which was permitted, as <b>the Sages depended</b> not on the assessment of the cattle herders but <b>on their</b> own <b>calculation,</b> perhaps here too the Sages depended on their own calculations and not on the decision of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Zarnokei and Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak.",
            "Reish Lakish changed his mind <b>and then said: It is not similar.

            "<b>When</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Zarnokei and Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak subsequently <b>came before Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> after hearing about his discussion with Reish Lakish, <b>they said to him</b> bitterly: Reish Lakish <b>referred to us as cattle herders, and the Master said nothing to him</b> in response?

            "concerning <b>a conspiring witness: Abaye says: He is disqualified retroactively,</b> from when he provided his testimony.

            "The Gemara explains the reasons for the two opinions: <b>Abaye says he is disqualified retroactively</b> because it is <b>from that time when he testified</b> that <b>he is</b> considered <b>a wicked man. And the Torah stated: “Do not put your hand with the wicked</b> to be an unrighteous witness” (Exodus 23:1), which is interpreted to mean: <b>Do not</b> allow <b>a wicked man</b> to serve as <b>a witness.</b>",
            "<b>Rava says that he is disqualified</b> only <b>from that point forward</b> because the disqualification of <b>a conspiring witness is a novelty,</b> i.e., it is not based on logic. The reason is that this is a case of two witnesses against two other witnesses, in which case the testimony of neither should be accepted. <b>What did you see that</b> causes <b>you</b> to <b>rely on</b> the second set of witnesses, who testify that the first set were not at the scene of the purported event? You could instead <b>rely upon</b> the first set of witnesses, who testify to the event, and consequently disbelieve the second set. Yet the Torah teaches that the second set of witnesses is always deemed credible and the first set is subjected to punishment as conspiring witnesses. Therefore, as the disqualification of a conspiring witness is an anomaly, <b>you have</b> the right to disqualify <b>him only from the time of its novelty and onward;</b> this counterintuitive disqualification is not applied retroactively.",

If the disqualification of the witnesses were applied retroactively, as by right it should, all these transactions would be nullified, which would cause a loss to these purchasers.",

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>From where is this matter,</b> that relatives are disqualified from bearing witness, derived? The Gemara answers: It is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“The fathers shall not be put to death for the children,</b> neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers; every man shall be put to death for his own sin” (Deuteronomy 24:16). <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> this first clause? <b>If</b> it is <b>to teach that the fathers shall not be put to death for the sin of the children, nor</b> shall <b>the children</b> be put to death <b>for the sin of the fathers,</b> this is unnecessary, as <b>it is in any event stated: “Every man shall be put to death for his own sin.”</b>",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the statement <b>“The fathers shall not be put to death for the children”</b> should be interpreted to mean that they shall not be put to death <b>by the testimony of the children,</b> and the statement <b>“Neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers”</b> should be interpreted to mean that they shall not be put to death <b>by the testimony of the fathers.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And are children not</b> put to death <b>for the sin of the fathers? But isn’t it written: “Visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children,</b> and upon the children’s children, unto the third and unto the fourth generation” (Exodus 34:7)?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> the verse is referring to a situation <b>where</b> the children <b>adopt the actions of their ancestors as their own.</b> If they do not behave like their ancestors they are not punished for their ancestors’ sins.",
            "This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse: <b>“And also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them”</b> (Leviticus 26:39), is referring to a case <b>where they adopt the actions of their ancestors as their own.</b> Do <b>you say</b> that it is referring specifically to a case <b>where they adopt</b> the actions of their ancestors, <b>or</b> perhaps it applies even <b>where they do not adopt</b> their ancestors’ actions? <b>When</b> the verse <b>states: “Every man shall be put to death for his own sin,”</b> the Torah explicates that one is not put to death if he did not sin.

            "§ The Gemara resumes its discussion of the source for the disqualification of relatives from bearing witness. From the fact that the verse: “The fathers shall not be put to death for the children” (Deuteronomy 24:16), is not phrased in the singular, i.e., A father shall not be put to death for his child, it is derived that not only are a father and child disqualified from bearing witness about one another, but closely related relatives, i.e., brothers, are also disqualified from bearing witness about each other’s children. Consequently, <b>we found</b> a source for the disqualification of <b>fathers</b> from bearing witness <b>about</b> their <b>children</b> or the children of their brothers, <b>and</b> for the disqualification of <b>children</b> from bearing witness <b>about</b> their <b>fathers</b> or their fathers’ brothers.",
            "<b>And all the more so,</b> the related <b>fathers,</b> e.g., brothers, are disqualified from bearing witness <b>about each other,</b> as they are certainly more closely related to each other than are a nephew and an uncle.",
            "But <b>from where do we</b> derive that one brother’s <b>children</b> cannot bear witness <b>about</b> the <b>children</b> of the other brother?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> if the children of one brother can bear witness about the children of the other brother, <b>let the verse write: The fathers shall not be put to death for the child.</b> For <b>what</b> reason is <b>“children”</b> written, in the plural? It is derived from here <b>that even children</b> of brothers are disqualified from bearing witness <b>about each other.</b>",
            "<b>We found</b> a source for the <i>halakha</i> that the <b>children</b> of brothers cannot bear witness <b>about each other. From where do we</b> derive that the <b>children</b> of brothers cannot bear witness together <b>about others?</b>",
            "<b>Rami bar Ḥama says:</b> This <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> based on <b>logical reasoning,</b> and is not derived from a verse.

Since a conspiring witness is executed for his testimony only if his co-witness is also rendered a conspiring witness, the testimony of his co-witness, who is a relative, is what causes him to be executed. This is tantamount to relatives bearing witness about each other. Therefore, relatives cannot serve as witnesses together.",
            "<b>Rava said to him: But according to your reasoning,</b> there is a difficulty arising from <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Batra</i> 56b): If one occupied land for three years, this serves in court as proof that he is the legal owner. If <b>three brothers</b> testify to his three-year possession of the land, with each one testifying separately about one year, <b>and one</b> unrelated individual <b>joins with</b> each of the brothers as the second witness, <b>these are</b> considered <b>three</b> distinct <b>testimonies</b> and are therefore accepted by the court.

In other words, they are punished only if all six of the witnesses are rendered conspiring witnesses, and the liability is divided among them.",
            "Rava states his objection: If so, <b>a conspiring witness</b> can be <b>found</b> to be <b>paying money due to the testimony of his brother,</b> and nevertheless, the brothers’ testimony is not disqualified.",

            "<b>Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> that relatives are disqualified from bearing witness together is derived from a different source: <b>If</b> it is <b>so</b> that relatives can bear witness together, <b>let the verse write: And a child</b> shall not be put to death <b>for the fathers, or: They</b> shall not be put to death <b>for the fathers.</b> For <b>what</b> reason is <b>“and the children”</b> written in the plural?

            "The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states: “You shall have one manner of law”</b> (Leviticus 24:22), which is interpreted to mean: <b>A law that is equal for you.</b> In other words, monetary law and capital law essentially follow the same guidelines.",

            "If <b>he made an admission with regard to movable property</b> that he owes, <b>and</b> the witnesses <b>performed</b> a formal <b>act of acquisition with him, they can write</b> a record of the admission in a document; <b>but if</b> they did <b>not</b> perform a formal act of acquisition <b>they may not write</b> a record of the admission.

            "§ With regard to <b>a certain</b> document of <b>admission in which</b> the following statement <b>was not written: He,</b> the one making the admission, <b>said to us: Write</b> a deed, <b>and sign</b> it, <b>and give</b> it <b>to</b> the creditor, <b>Abaye and Rava both say</b> that <b>this is</b> a case in which the principle <b>of Reish Lakish</b> is applicable.",

This reflects the principle that a document is not written by a scribe and signed by witnesses unless they know that the action to which it attests was performed appropriately. In light of this, the fact that a certain detail is missing from the wording of the document does not prove that the detail did not take place, as the action was presumably performed properly. Consequently, a document of admission lacking the sentence: He said to us: Write a deed, and sign it, and give it to the creditor, is valid.",
            "<b>Rav Pappi objects to this, and some say</b> it is <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua,</b> who raises this objection: <b>Is there anything that we,</b> the Sages, <b>do not know, and the scribes of the court</b> do <b>know?</b> Since not all of the Sages are aware that the witnesses of an admission cannot write a deed of admission unless the one making the admission asks them to, the scribes certainly cannot be expected to ensure that this condition is fulfilled.",

            "§ The Gemara continues its discussion of when an admission is deemed credible. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In a case where <b>one said to</b> the children of another: <b>I saw that your father hid money in a chest, box, or cabinet, saying:</b> This money <b>belongs to so-and-so,</b> or: This money <b>is second tithe,</b> and the money was found where he said, the <i>halakha</i> depends on the circumstances.

            "<b>The principle of the matter</b> is as follows: In <b>any</b> case <b>where it is in</b> the <b>power of</b> the witness <b>to take</b> the money, <b>his statement stands;</b> if <b>it is not in his power to take</b> the money, <b>he has said nothing.</b>",

            "The Gemara explains the contradiction: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that <b>we require inquiry and interrogation</b> in cases of monetary law, <b>how are we concerned</b> that <b>perhaps they delayed and wrote it?</b> The signatory witnesses would be asked on which day they signed the promissory note, and when that does not accord with what is written in the promissory note, their testimony would be disregarded.",

            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Akiva says</b> that when the verse states: “Whatever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, that offers a burnt-offering <b>or sacrifice”</b> (Leviticus 17:8), it serves <b>to include one who sprinkles</b> blood of consecrated offerings outside the Tent of Meeting. Rav Ashi explains: <b>What do the two</b> <i>tanna’im</i> <b>include</b> by means of these explanations? One who performs <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood outside the Tent of Meeting.

            "The Gemara questions this example: <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Abbahu say</b> that the difference <b>between them</b> is with regard to one who <b>slaughtered</b> the offering <b>and sprinkled</b> the blood, as <b>according to the statement of Rabbi Yishmael he is liable</b> for <b>only one</b> transgression, and <b>according to the statement of Rabbi Akiva</b> he is <b>liable</b> for <b>two</b> transgressions?",

            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rather,</b> the verse <b>juxtaposes disputes to leprous sores,</b> teaching that <b>just as leprous sores</b> are viewed by a priest only <b>in the daytime, as it is written: “And on the day when</b> raw flesh <b>appears in him</b> he shall be impure” (Leviticus 13:14), <b>so too disputes</b> are judged only <b>in the daytime.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan found another unattributed mishna,</b> i.e., the mishna here, which indicates that a blind man can serve as a judge: In cases of <b>monetary law,</b> the court <b>judges during the daytime and may conclude</b> the deliberations and issue the ruling even <b>at night.</b> Accordingly, judging cases of monetary law is not compared to viewing leprous sores, which is the source for disqualifying a blind judge.",

            "<b>And what</b> does <b>Rabbi Meir interpret</b> from <b>this</b> verse: <b>“On the day that he causes his sons to inherit”?</b> He already derived from the juxtaposition to leprous sores that the court cannot issue a verdict at night.

            "Rav Naḥman suggests: <b>Perhaps you are stating</b> a distinction between day and night with regard to the <b>adjudication of inheritances.</b> A proof for this distinction is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A verse in the passage concerning inheritance states: <b>“And it shall be for the children of Israel a statute of judgment”</b> (Numbers 27:11), teaching that <b>the entire portion is placed [<i>ure’a</i>]</b> together <b>to be</b> considered a matter of <b>judgment,</b> subject to the procedural rules that apply to a matter of the court.",

But what can I do, since your blood is not given over to me, as the Torah states: “At the mouth of two witnesses,</b> or three witnesses, <b>shall he that is to die be put to death”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:6), and I did not witness you killing him. <b>The One Who knows</b> one’s <b>thoughts shall punish this man who killed another.</b> The Sages <b>said: They did not move from there before a snake came and bit the</b> murderer, <b>and he died.</b>",
            "The Gemara questions this account: <b>But was this</b> murderer <b>fit</b> to die by being bitten <b>by a snake? But doesn’t Rav Yosef say, and so the school of Ḥizkiyya</b> also <b>taught: From the day that the Temple was destroyed, although the Sanhedrin ceased</b> to be extant, the <b>four</b> types of court-imposed <b>capital punishment have not ceased.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Have they</b> really <b>not ceased? But they have ceased,</b> as court-imposed capital punishment is no longer given. <b>Rather,</b> the intention is that <b>the <i>halakha</i> of</b> the <b>four</b> types of court-imposed <b>capital punishment has not ceased</b> to be applicable.",
            "The Gemara explains: How so? For <b>one who</b> would <b>be liable</b> to be executed by <b>stoning, either</b> he <b>falls from a roof or an animal mauls him</b> and breaks his bones. This death is similar to death by stoning, in which the one liable to be executed is pushed from a platform and his bones break from the impact of the fall. For <b>one who</b> would <b>be liable</b> to be executed by <b>burning, either</b> he <b>falls into a fire</b> and is burned <b>or a snake bites him,</b> as a snakebite causes a burning sensation. For <b>one who</b> would <b>be liable to</b> be executed by <b>slaying</b> through decapitation by the sword, <b>either</b> he <b>is turned over to the authorities</b> and they execute him with a sword, <b>or robbers come upon him</b> and murder him. <b>One who</b> would <b>be liable</b> to be executed by <b>strangling either drowns in a river</b> and is choked by the water <b>or dies of diphtheria [<i>bisronekhi</i>],</b> which causes his breathing to become constricted. According to this, a murderer, whose verdict in court would be death by slaying, should not be bitten by a snake.",
            "The Sages <b>say</b> in explanation: <b>That</b> murderer <b>had another sin</b> for which he deserved execution by burning, and <b>as the Master says: One who is found liable</b> by the court <b>to</b> receive <b>two</b> types of <b>court-imposed capital punishment is sentenced to the harsher</b> of the two, and burning is considered a harsher death than slaying (see 50a).",
            "§ The mishna teaches that in cases of capital law the court warns the witnesses not to testify <b>based on conjecture.</b> The Gemara comments: One can infer that it is only <b>in</b> cases of <b>capital law that we do not</b> rule based on <b>conjecture, but in</b> cases of <b>monetary law, we do</b> rule based on <b>conjecture.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But according to your reasoning,</b> with regard to <b>that</b> which the mishna <b>teaches,</b> that the court warns the witnesses not to provide <b>testimony</b> based on <b>hearsay,</b> should one infer that it is <b>in</b> cases of <b>capital law that we do not say</b> that testimony based on hearsay is allowed, <b>but in</b> cases of <b>monetary law, we do say</b> that testimony based on hearsay is allowed? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (29a): <b>If</b> the witness <b>said:</b> The defendant <b>said to me:</b> It is true <b>that I owe</b> the plaintiff, or if he says: <b>So-and-so said to me that</b> the defendant <b>owes</b> the plaintiff, the witness <b>has said nothing,</b> i.e., his testimony is disregarded. These two statements by witnesses are examples of testimony based on hearsay, yet they are not valid in cases of monetary law. A witness’s testimony is not valid testimony <b>unless he says,</b> for example: The defendant <b>admitted in our presence to</b> the plaintiff <b>that he owes him two hundred dinars,</b> as by admitting the debt in the presence of witnesses he rendered himself liable to pay the amount that he mentioned.",
            "<b>Evidently, although</b> testimony based on hearsay <b>is invalid in</b> cases of <b>monetary law, we tell</b> the witnesses to be aware of this <b>in capital law.

            "§ The mishna teaches that the court would say: <b>You should know</b> that cases of capital law are not like cases of monetary law, and would reference the murder of Abel by Cain. <b>Rav Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, says:</b> By employing the plural term for blood, “The voice of your brother’s blood [<i>demei</i>] cries out to Me from the ground” (Genesis 4:10), the verse <b>teaches that Cain caused multiple wounds</b> and <b>multiple injuries to his brother Abel.

The numerical value of the letters of the word “<i>venoshantem</i>” is 852, and the Jewish people were exiled in the 850th year after entering Eretz Yisrael.

            "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Any place</b> in the Bible from <b>where the heretics</b> attempt to <b>prove their heresy,</b> i.e., that there is more than one god, <b>the response to their</b> claim is <b>alongside them,</b> i.e., in the immediate vicinity of the verses they cite. The verse states that God said: <b>“Let us make man in our image”</b> (Genesis 1:26), employing the plural, <b>but it</b> then <b>states: “And God created man in His image”</b> (Genesis 1:27), employing the singular. The verse states that God said: <b>“Come, let us go down and there confound their language”</b> (Genesis 11:7), but it also states: <b>“And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower”</b> (Genesis 11:5). The verse states in the plural: <b>“There God was revealed [<i>niglu</i>] to him</b> when he fled from the face of his brother” (Genesis 35:7), but it also states in the singular: <b>“To God Who answers [<i>haoneh</i>] me in the day of my distress”</b> (Genesis 35:3).",
            "Rabbi Yoḥanan cites several examples where the counterclaim is in the same verse as the claim of the heretics. The verse states: <b>“For what nation is there so great that has God so near to them as the Lord our God is whenever we call upon Him?”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:7), where the term “near” is written in plural, <i>kerovim</i>, but the term “upon Him” is written in singular. Another verse states: <b>“And who is like Your people, like Israel, a nation one in the earth, whom God went to redeem unto Himself for a people?”</b> (II Samuel 7:23), where the term “went” is written in plural, <i>halekhu</i>, but the term “Himself” is written in singular. Another verse states: “I beheld <b>till thrones were placed, and one that was ancient of days did sit”</b> (Daniel 7:9); where the term “thrones” is written in plural, <i>kharsavan</i>, but the term “sit” is written in singular.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>these</b> instances of plural words? Why does the verse employ the plural at all when referring to God? The Gemara explains: This is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan, as Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The Holy One, Blessed be He, does not act unless He consults with the entourage of Above,</b> i.e., the angels, <b>as it is stated: “The matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the sentence by the word of the holy ones”</b> (Daniel 4:14).",
            "The Gemara clarifies: This <b>works out well for</b> almost <b>all</b> the verses, as they describe an action taken by God, but <b>what is there to say</b> concerning the verse: “I beheld <b>till thrones were placed”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>One</b> throne is <b>for Him and one</b> throne is <b>for David,</b> i.e., the messiah, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One</b> throne is <b>for Him and one</b> throne is <b>for David;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that he sacrificed him <b>for the sake of Heaven, this is as it is written: “And there was great indignation against Israel,”</b> as the gentile attempted to honor God according to his understanding, while the Jewish people were straying from worshipping God, leading to God’s anger against them. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that he sacrificed him <b>for the sake of idol worship, why</b> would the verse state: <b>“And there was…indignation”?</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: This can be understood <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> those three instances of idol worship, an idolatrous city, and conspiring witnesses <b>are not similar to each other,</b> so how can one derive the <i>halakhot</i> of one from the other?

The case of <b>conspiring witnesses</b> is <b>not similar to those two, as</b> those who transgress the two other transgressions <b>require forewarning</b> in order to be liable for the transgression, while conspiring witnesses are not forewarned before they testify.",
            "The Gemara explains: This is not an association based on conceptual similarity alone; rather, <b>we learn one from the other based on</b> a verbal analogy employing the words <b>“diligently”</b> and <b>“diligently.”</b> “Diligently” is used in all three verses. The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> this <b>verbal analogy</b> must be <b>free,</b> i.e., these terms must be superfluous in their context. The Torah included them for the express purpose of establishing the verbal analogy. A verbal analogy that is based on otherwise extraneous terms cannot be logically refuted.

By way of this verbal analogy, the Gemara has derived the requirement for seven interrogations in cases of capital law where the punishment is either death by stoning or death by the sword.",
            "The Gemara continues: <b>And</b> one can <b>learn</b> that this applies to <b>those</b> transgressors <b>who are strangled</b> as well, <b>by</b> means of <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from those</b> transgressors who are <b>stoned and from those</b> who are <b>killed</b> by the sword.

            "The Gemara questions this last inference: <b>This works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say</b> that <b>stoning</b> is more <b>severe</b> than burning (see 49b). Consequently, it is possible to derive by means of an <i>a fortiori</i> inference the <i>halakha</i> of a transgression whose punishment is burning from the <i>halakha</i> of a transgression whose punishment is stoning. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who says</b> that <b>burning</b> is more <b>severe</b> than stoning, <b>what is there to say?</b>",

But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:3): <b>If</b> the <b>statement of</b> that student <b>has substance he would never descend from there,</b> as his statement demonstrates that he is capable of deliberating with the other judges. <b>But if</b> the <b>statement of</b> that student <b>does not have substance, he would not descend from there the entire day, in order that his ascent should not be a descent for him,</b> i.e., to avoid humiliating him. <b>Abaye said: Interpret</b> the mishna to be <b>with regard to</b> a case when the <b>statement of</b> that student <b>does not have substance.</b>",
            "The mishna teaches that if the court <b>found</b> it fit to <b>acquit</b> the defendant during the deliberations, as all or a majority of them agree to acquit him, they excuse him. The mishna further teaches that the judges would not drink wine all day. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> they did <b>not</b> drink <b>wine? Rabbi Aḥa bar Ḥanina says</b> that it is because <b>the verse states:</b> “It is not for kings to drink wine, <b>nor for princes [<i>rozenim</i>] to say: Where is strong drink”</b> (Proverbs 31:4). Rabbi Aḥa bar Ḥanina explains: This is a directive to <b>those who deal with the secret of the world [<i>berazo shel olam</i>],</b> i.e., such stringent matters: <b>Do not become drunk.</b>",
            "§ The mishna teaches: If the court <b>found</b> it fit to <b>acquit him</b> during the deliberations, as all or a majority of them agree to acquit him, they release him. It was further taught in the mishna that when the court cannot arrive at a verdict they add judges in pairs of two and deliberate until there is a clear verdict. If they added the maximum number of judges and still cannot reach a clear verdict, they discuss the matter until one of those who deems him liable sees the validity of the statements of those who acquit, and changes his position. The Gemara asks: If the judges do not change their position, as they <b>do not see</b> the validity of the position of those who acquit him, <b>what</b> is done?",
            "<b>Rabbi Aḥa says: They release him,</b> as he was not found liable. <b>And likewise Rabbi Yoḥanan says: They release him. Rav Pappa said to Abaye: But</b> if they ultimately release him if the court is deadlocked, why do they attempt to convince each other at all when <b>they should release him from the outset?</b> Abaye <b>said to him: This</b> is what <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The reason is <b>so that they not leave the court confounded,</b> without reaching some definite conclusion, as this would tarnish the reputation of the court.",
            "<b>Some say</b> that this is what <b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: But why do I</b> need <b>them to add</b> judges at all when <b>they should release him from the first court?</b> Once the first court did not find him liable, they should release him. Why add judges? Abaye <b>said to him: Rabbi Yosei holds in accordance with your</b> opinion, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Just as</b> the court <b>does not add</b> judges <b>to a court of seventy-one, so too,</b> the court <b>does not add</b> judges <b>to a court of twenty-three.</b> If the court of twenty-three cannot arrive at a verdict, they release him.",
            "<b>The Sages taught: In</b> cases of <b>monetary law</b> one <b>says: The judgment has grown aged,</b> i.e., this matter is very difficult and requires scrutiny, <b>but in</b> cases of <b>capital law</b> one <b>does not say: The judgment has grown aged.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>The judgment has grown aged?

In other words, the deliberations have been exhausted, and it is time to vote on a verdict.",
            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the first explanation from a <i>baraita</i>: In a situation where they did not reach a decision, <b>the greatest among the judges says: The judgment has grown aged.</b> The Gemara explains the objection: <b>Granted, if you say</b> this means: <b>The judgment</b> has grown <b>wise, this</b> would be why the <i>baraita</i> states <b>that the greatest</b> judge <b>says</b> this statement, as arriving at a verdict is an honor for the court, and consequently the greatest of the court should be the one to announce it. <b>But if you say</b> this means: <b>The judgment</b> has <b>aged, is it not enough that the greatest</b> among the judges in particular <b>not say</b> so? <b>Must he humiliate himself</b> by stating that they cannot reach a verdict?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> the greatest of the judges must also announce that the court cannot reach a verdict. <b>Being shamed by oneself is not comparable to being shamed by others.</b> Therefore, it is preferable that the greatest of the judges state this conclusion, rather than having one of the more junior judges state it.",
            "<b>Some say</b> they raised an objection to the second explanation: <b>Granted, if you say</b> this means: <b>The judgment</b> has <b>aged, this</b> would be the reason that the greatest one states it, <b>because being shamed by oneself is not comparable to being shamed by others.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>A matter of the court is different, as</b> its administration is <b>incumbent upon the greatest</b> judge. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (29a): <b>When they finished</b> deliberating <b>the matter, they would bring in</b> the litigants. <b>The greatest of the judges</b> would <b>say: So-and-so, you are exempt</b> from paying; or: <b>So-and-so, you are liable</b> to pay."

            "The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived that the stoning is carried out outside the three camps? <b>As the Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“Take out him who has cursed to outside the camp”</b> (Leviticus 24:14).

            "The Gemara rejects this reasoning: <b>On the contrary,</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing one who is sentenced to be stoned <b>should be derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing <b>offerings slaughtered outside</b> the Temple courtyard, for four reasons.",
            "The Gemara explains the four reasons: <b>As</b> in both cases it is <b>a person</b> who is outside, either the one who is taken outside for stoning, or the one who slaughters the offerings outside the Temple courtyard, whereas in the case of the bulls brought as sin-offerings, it is the bulls that are carried outside the camp.

Additionally, both the blasphemer and the one who slaughters offerings outside the Temple courtyard pay <b>with</b> their <b>souls,</b> as slaughtering an offering outside the Temple is punishable with <i>karet</i>.

The Gemara rejects this argument: The cases are not similar. <b>There, no one said</b> that he had a reason to acquit the condemned man. <b>Here,</b> the student already <b>said</b> that he had a reason to acquit the condemned man.

            "<b>And Rava derives</b> a verbal analogy between the word <b>“there”</b> written in the context of a grave <b>from</b> the word <b>“there”</b> written in the context of objects of <b>idol worship.</b> The verse states concerning objects of idol worship: “The places in which the nations…served their gods there” (Deuteronomy 12:2). <b>Just as</b> it <b>does not become prohibited</b> to derive benefit from objects of <b>idol worship through</b> mere <b>designation,</b> but only through actual ritual worship, <b>so too, here</b> it <b>does not become prohibited</b> to derive benefit from items relating to a deceased person <b>through</b> mere <b>designation.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And Rava, what is the reason</b> that <b>he does not derive</b> a verbal analogy <b>from a heifer whose neck is broken?</b> The Gemara answers: Rava could have <b>said to you:</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>We derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing <b>the accessories</b> relating to a dead person, e.g., a shroud, <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing the <b>accessories</b> used in idol worship, e.g., the animal sacrificed to the idol.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And Abaye, what is the reason</b> that <b>he did not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> by way of a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing accessories used in <b>idol worship?</b> The Gemara answers: Abaye could have <b>said to you</b> that <b>we learn</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing <b>something that</b> involves a proper <b>way</b> of conduct, i.e., burying the dead, <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing <b>something that</b> involves a proper <b>way</b> of conduct, i.e., the rite relating to the heifer whose neck is broken, as these are both mitzvot by Torah law. This is <b>to the exclusion of</b> objects of <b>idol worship, which do not</b> involve a proper <b>way</b> of conduct.",
            "§ The Gemara presents <b>a mnemonic</b> for the forthcoming series of attempted proofs concerning the dispute between Rava and Abaye: <b>Scarf; monument; that was hewed; pouch; craftsman.</b>",
            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> against Rava from a <i>baraita</i> discussing ritual impurity that is contracted by treading: If <b>a scarf is ritually impure</b> with impurity imparted by <b>treading,</b> e.g., after a <i>zav</i> sat or lay down upon it, <b>and</b> its owner then <b>designated it</b> as a cover <b>for</b> a Torah <b>scroll,</b> it is <b>pure of</b> the more severe level of ritual impurity, that which is imparted by <b>treading,</b> even without immersion, because it is no longer an object intended to be lied on or sat upon. <b>But</b> it is still <b>impure</b> with the less severe ritual impurity, that which is contracted <b>by touching that which is treaded upon.</b> This indicates that mere designation has halakhic significance and validity. The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>Say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> should read as follows: The owner of the scarf <b>designated it</b> as a cover for a Torah scroll <b>and wrapped it</b> around the scroll, so that there was not only designation, but an action as well.",
            "The Gemara asks: If there was an action, <b>why do I</b> need for the <i>baraita</i> to say that the owner <b>designated it and wrapped it?</b> Wouldn’t wrapping alone have sufficed? The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Ḥisda, as Rav Ḥisda says:</b> With regard to <b>this cloth that one designated for</b> the purpose of <b>bundling phylacteries in it,</b> if he already <b>bundled phylacteries in it,</b> then <b>it is forbidden to bundle coins in it,</b> as it was designated and used as an accessory of a sacred object. But if <b>he</b> merely <b>designated it</b> for that purpose <b>but did not</b> yet <b>bundle</b> phylacteries <b>in it,</b> or if <b>he bundled</b> phylacteries <b>in it but did not</b> previously <b>designate it</b> for bundling phylacteries, then <b>it is permitted to bundle coins in it.</b> Consequently, in the case of the scarf, it was necessary both to designate it as a cover for the Torah scroll and to actually wrap it around the scroll.",
            "<b>And according to Abaye, who said</b> that <b>designation is</b> a significant <b>matter,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is as follows: If <b>he designated</b> the cloth for the purpose of bundling phylacteries in it, <b>even if he did not bundle</b> phylacteries <b>in it,</b> it is prohibited to bundle money in it. In a case where <b>he</b> already <b>bundled</b> phylacteries <b>in it, if he designated</b> the cloth for bundling phylacteries, <b>yes,</b> it is prohibited to bundle money in it; but <b>if he did not designate it</b> for bundling phylacteries, bundling money in the cloth is <b>not</b> prohibited.",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another proof against Rava: With regard to <b>a monument</b> that was built as a memorial <b>for the sake of</b> an individual while he was still <b>alive,</b> one is <b>permitted to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from it, as it is like any other construction; but if even a single <b>row</b> of stones <b>was added to it for the sake of a corpse,</b> one is <b>prohibited from</b> deriving <b>benefit</b> from it, apparently even before the deceased is buried there. This seems to indicate that mere designation is a significant matter. The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where the corpse was placed</b> under the monument, so that it became forbidden not through mere designation, but by way of an action.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so, why</b> does the <i>baraita</i> <b>specifically</b> mention that a row of stones <b>was added?</b> If the deceased was buried under the monument, one should be prohibited from deriving benefit from it <b>even when</b> a row of stones <b>was not added,</b> as the entire monument has been used for the dead. The Gemara explains: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for the <i>baraita</i> to state that a row of stones was added in order to teach us that <b>even if</b> the corpse <b>was</b> later <b>removed</b> from the grave, the monument remains forbidden since it had been designated for a corpse.",
            "<b>Rafram bar Pappa says</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda says: If</b> the corpse was later removed from the grave and <b>one recognizes</b> the row of stones that had been added to the monument in the dead man’s honor, he may <b>remove</b> that row of stones, <b>and</b> it is <b>permitted</b> to derive benefit from the rest of the construction.",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> yet another proof against Rava from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one hewed a grave for his</b> deceased <b>father</b> in one place, <b>and</b> then <b>went and buried him in a different place,</b> the son <b>may never be buried in</b> the grave that he had dug. This indicates that mere designation is a significant matter. The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> the son may not be buried in the grave that he had dug <b>because</b> that would detract from <b>the honor</b> that he must show <b>his father,</b> not because the designation is significant with regard to the status of a grave in general.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>So, too, it is reasonable</b> that the son may not be buried in the grave that he had dug only because of the honor due to his father, <b>as the latter clause</b> of the same <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches: Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Even</b> if <b>one hewed stones for his father’s</b> grave <b>and</b> then <b>went and buried him in a different place,</b> the son himself <b>may never be buried</b> in a tomb constructed <b>from those</b> stones.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the son may not be buried in the grave that he dug for his father <b>because of the honor</b> that must be shown <b>his father,</b> it is <b>well</b> understood why he can also not be buried in tomb constructed from stones that he hewed for his father’s grave. <b>But if you say</b> that it is <b>because of designation,</b> the son should be permitted to be buried in such a tomb, as <b>is there anyone who says</b> that <b>spinning</b> yarn in order <b>to weave</b> it into cloth for shrouds is regarded as designating an item for a dead person, resulting in a prohibition against deriving benefit from the yarn? In such a case there is certainly no prohibition, and the case of hewing stones for a tomb is analogous to a case of spinning yarn in order to weave it into cloth.",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof in support of Rava from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a fresh grave</b> that was not designated for a particular individual, one is <b>permitted to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from it.

It may be inferred from here that if a non-viable newborn <b>was cast</b> into the grave, <b>yes,</b> one is prohibited from deriving benefit from the grave, but if it <b>was not cast</b> into the grave, one is <b>not</b> prohibited from deriving benefit from the grave, indicating that mere designation is insignificant.",
            "The Gemara rejects this inference: <b>The same is true even if</b> a non-viable newborn <b>was not cast</b> into the grave; one is still prohibited from deriving benefit from the grave, merely by virtue of the designation. Why, then, does the <i>baraita</i> say that a non-viable newborn was cast into the grave? This serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, who says: A non-viable newborn does not take possession of its grave</b> to render it forbidden even once it is buried there. To counter this opinion, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this opinion is not accepted, and a non-viable newborn is treated like any other corpse.",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another proof in support of Rava’s opinion from a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 2:5): The money <b>left over</b> from the money that was collected for burying <b>the dead</b> must be allocated <b>to</b> the burial of other <b>dead</b> people. The money <b>left over</b> from the money that was collected for burying a particular <b>dead person</b> is given <b>to his heirs.</b> Evidently, money that had been designated for the sake of a dead person but was not actually used for burying him does not become forbidden, and his heirs may use it. The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with money <b>that had been collected</b> for the deceased <b>during his lifetime.</b> It was thought that a certain individual was soon to die, and money was collected to cover the costs of his burial. Since at the time the money was collected the person was alive, the money had not been designated for the sake of a dead person. Therefore, one is permitted to derive benefit from it, and it is given to the heirs of the deceased.",
            "The Gemara raises an objection: <b>But we were not taught this, as we learned</b> in the mishna: The money <b>left over</b> from the money that was collected for burying <b>the dead</b> must be allocated <b>to</b> the burial of other <b>dead</b> people.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>And according to your reasoning, say the latter clause</b> of that same mishna, which appears to support the opinion of Abaye: <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> If money was left over from the sum collected for the burial of a particular dead person, the money <b>may not be touched until Elijah comes</b> and resolves the uncertainty as to whether or not the money is forbidden. <b>Rabbi Natan says:</b> The leftover money shall be <b>used</b> for the laying of another <b>row</b> of stones <b>over the grave of</b> the deceased <b>or</b> for the <b>sprinkling</b> of fragrant wine <b>before his bier</b> as he is brought for burial.

Therefore, whatever money is not required for his burial is given to his heirs, as it was never included in the prohibition.",
            "<b>And Rabbi Meir is uncertain</b> as to <b>whether</b> the sum that it is not fitting to spend for his burial <b>is encompassed</b> by the prohibition <b>or is not encompassed</b> by the prohibition. <b>Therefore,</b> the leftover money <b>may not be touched until Elijah comes</b> and clarifies the matter. <b>And</b> it is <b>obvious to Rabbi Natan that</b> all of the money collected <b>is certainly encompassed</b> by the prohibition, including the money that it is not fitting to spend for the deceased’s burial. <b>Therefore,</b> whatever money is left over should be <b>used</b> for the laying of another <b>row</b> of stones <b>over the grave of</b> the deceased or for the sprinkling of fragrant wine before his bier.",

Solomon said to him: But <b>Asahel was</b> pursuing Abner with the intention of killing him, and therefore he had the status of <b>a pursuer.</b> Since Abner killed Asahel in an act of self-defense, you had no right to kill him as a redeemer of Asahel’s blood. Joab <b>said to</b> Solomon: Abner <b>could have saved himself by</b> wounding Asahel in <b>one of his limbs.</b> Having failed to do so, he was guilty of murder, and I was therefore entitled to kill him.",
            "Solomon <b>said to him:</b> Abner was <b>not able to</b> injure Asahel, because he was running and could not aim with precision.

            "Solomon <b>said to</b> Joab: <b>Set aside Abner,</b> as you have presented a convincing argument that you are not liable for his death. But <b>what is the reason you killed Amasa?</b> Joab <b>said to him:</b> I killed <b>Amasa</b> in punishment for his having <b>rebelled against the king, as it is written: “And the king said to Amasa: Muster to me the men of Judah within three days,</b> and be you here present. <b>And Amasa went to call the men of Judah, but he was later</b> than the set time that he had assigned to him” (II Samuel 20:4–5).",

Consequently, Amasa was justified when he did not muster the men of Judah at the appointed time, and you had no right to kill him.",

Rather than tell Saul that David could have killed him and refrained from doing so, Abner suggested to Saul that his robe may have been torn by a thornbush and that his jug of water may have been taken by one of his own men.

They [<i>henna</i>] are near kinswomen; it is lewdness” (Leviticus 18:17).

            "The Gemara clarifies: If she is married to a man of flawed lineage, she is already profaned. <b>As the Master said,</b> it is derived from the verse: <b>“And if a priest’s daughter be married to a non-priest,</b> she shall not eat of that which is set apart from the sacred” (Leviticus 22:12), that <b>once she engaged in intercourse with one who is unfit for her, he has disqualified her</b> from ever partaking of <i>teruma</i>.",

Rabbi Yehuda derives from this verse that <b>you shall render him liable due to</b> the fact that she is <b>his mother, but you shall not render him liable</b> to bring another sin-offering <b>due to</b> the fact that she is his <b>father’s wife.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> it should be derived from the verse: <b>“The nakedness of your father’s wife you shall not uncover; it is your father’s nakedness”</b> (Leviticus 18:8), that <b>you shall render him liable due to</b> the fact that she is his <b>father’s wife, but you shall not render him liable due to</b> the fact that she is <b>his mother.</b>",
            "<b>But</b> if so, with regard to one’s <b>mother who is his father’s wife,</b> it is found that the verse <b>stands,</b> i.e., is written, <b>here,</b> with regard to intercourse with one’s mother, <b>and excludes</b> liability due to the fact that she is his father’s wife, and <b>stands there,</b> with regard to intercourse with one’s father’s wife, <b>and excludes</b> liability due to the fact that she is his mother. The result <b>now</b> is that for <b>his mother who is not his father’s wife he is rendered liable,</b> and for <b>his father’s wife who is not his mother he is rendered liable,</b> but for <b>his mother who is his father’s wife he is not rendered liable at all,</b> which seems absurd.",
            "<b>And furthermore, according to the Rabbis too,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Yehuda and hold that one who engages in intercourse with his mother who is married to his father is liable to bring two sin-offerings, <b>isn’t</b> the verse: <b>“She is your mother,” written;</b> i.e., how do they explain this verse? <b>Rather, that</b> phrase is <b>necessary for</b> the <i>halakha</i> derived from it by <b>Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi,</b> as the Gemara will soon explain (54a). Therefore, <b>according to Rabbi Yehuda as well, that</b> phrase is <b>necessary for</b> the <i>halakha</i> derived by <b>Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi,</b> and Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion in the mishna cannot be derived from it.",
            "<b>Rather, Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, says</b> that there is a different source for Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion: <b>The verse states:</b> “You shall not uncover <b>her nakedness [<i>ervatah</i>],”</b> in the singular form, from which it is derived that <b>you shall render him liable for one forbidden sexual relationship [<i>erva</i>], but you shall not render him liable for two</b> types of <b>forbidden sexual relationships.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> then from the verse: <b>“You shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter-in-law; she is your son’s wife, you shall not uncover her nakedness”</b> (Leviticus 18:15), should it <b>also</b> be derived that <b>you shall render him liable for one forbidden sexual relationship, but you shall not render him liable for two</b> types of <b>forbidden sexual relationships?</b>",
            "<b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>One who engages in intercourse with his daughter-in-law</b> is <b>liable</b> to bring two sin-offerings <b>for</b> his intercourse with <b>her:</b> One <b>due to</b> the prohibition against engaging in intercourse with one’s <b>daughter-in-law, and</b> one <b>due to</b> the prohibition against engaging in intercourse with <b>a married woman;</b> the former liability applies <b>both during his son’s lifetime and after his son’s death.

            "<b>Rather,</b> it must be explained that <b>since</b> the daughter-in-law has <b>one body, although</b> engaging in intercourse with her involves <b>two prohibitions,</b> the term <b>“her nakedness [<i>ervatah</i>],”</b> in the singular, <b>is written. Here too,</b> with regard to one’s father’s wife, <b>since</b> she has <b>one body, although</b> there <b>are two prohibitions,</b> the term <b>“her nakedness [<i>ervatah</i>]” is written.</b>",
            "<b>Rather, Rava says</b> that there is an alternative source for Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion: <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that concerning the meaning of the phrase <b>“the nakedness of your father,” this is</b> referring to <b>your father’s wife. And he derives</b> this interpretation <b>by means of a verbal analogy</b> from the verse: “And the man who lies with his father’s wife, he has uncovered his father’s nakedness” (Leviticus 20:11).",
            "<b>And</b> the Torah <b>indicates</b> that she is forbidden <b>whether</b> she is <b>his father’s wife who is his mother</b> or <b>whether</b> she is <b>his father’s wife who is not his mother.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>Say</b> that <i>nokev</i> means the <b>utterance of the</b> ineffable <b>name of</b> God. <b>As it is written: “And Moses and Aaron took these men that are pointed out [<i>nikkevu</i>] by name”</b> (Numbers 1:17). <b>And</b> the <b>prohibition</b> to do so is derived <b>from here: “You shall fear the Lord, your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:13).",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>One</b> answer is <b>that</b> for one to be liable, it is <b>necessary</b> that his transgression involve the <b>name</b> of God <b>with</b> the <b>name</b> of God, <b>and</b> such a transgression is <b>not</b> possible if the reference is to uttering the ineffable name of God. <b>Furthermore,</b> the prohibition derived from the verse “You shall fear the Lord, your God” <b>is a prohibition</b> stated as <b>a positive mitzva, and a prohibition</b> stated as <b>a positive mitzva is not considered a prohibition.</b>",
            "The Gemara presents an alternative proof that <i>nokev</i> is referring to cursing: <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>the verse states: “And</b> the son of the Israelite woman <b>blasphemed [<i>vayyikkov</i>]</b> the name <b>and cursed”</b> (Leviticus 24:11). <b>That is to say that</b> the meaning of <b><i>nokev</i> is</b> to <b>curse.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps</b> this verse does not prove that the meaning of <i>nokev</i> is to curse; rather, it indicates that one is not liable to be executed <b>unless he does both,</b> i.e., both <i>nokev</i> and cursing God? The Gemara answers: This shall <b>not enter your mind, as it is written: “Bring forth the one who cursed…</b>and stone him” (Leviticus 24:14), <b>and it is not written: Bring forth the <i>nokev</i> and one who cursed.

            "<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “Anyone who curses his God shall bear his sin”?

But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>With regard to</b> the following types of <b>robbery:</b> One who <b>steals or robs, and likewise</b> one who engages in intercourse with a married <b>beautiful woman</b> who was taken as a prisoner of war, <b>and likewise</b> all actions <b>similar to these,</b> if they are done by <b>a gentile to</b> another <b>gentile, or</b> by <b>a gentile to a Jew,</b> the action is <b>prohibited; but</b> if <b>a Jew</b> does so <b>to a gentile, it is permitted?</b> The Gemara explains the question: <b>And if it is so</b> that a gentile is liable to be executed for robbery, and it is not merely prohibited to him, <b>let</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach</b> that he is <b>liable</b> to be executed.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Because</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>wanted to teach</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> that if <b>a Jew</b> does so <b>to a gentile, it is permitted, he taught</b> in <b>the former clause</b> that if a gentile does one of these, <b>it is prohibited.</b> If the <i>baraita</i> were to state that if a gentile does so, he is liable, it would have to state that if a Jew does so to a gentile, he is exempt, because this is the opposite of liable. That would indicate that it is actually prohibited for a Jew to do so to a gentile, and that he is merely exempt from liability, which is not the case. Therefore, the word prohibited is used with regard to a gentile. Therefore, this does not prove that a gentile is exempt from capital punishment.",
            "The Gemara challenges: <b>But wherever there is liability</b> for capital punishment, this <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> it; <b>as it is taught</b> in <b>the first clause: With regard to bloodshed,</b> if <b>a gentile</b> murders another <b>gentile, or a gentile</b> murders <b>a Jew,</b> he is <b>liable.</b> If <b>a Jew</b> murders <b>a gentile,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> Evidently, the term liable is used in the <i>baraita</i>.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in that case, <b>how should</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach</b> it? <b>Should he teach</b> it using the terms <b>prohibited and permitted,</b> indicating that a Jew may kill a gentile <i>ab initio</i>? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that with regard to <b>a gentile, and</b> likewise with regard to Jewish <b>shepherds of small livestock,</b> who were typically robbers, <b>one may not raise</b> them out of a pit into which they fell, <b>and one may not lower</b> them into a pit? In other words, one may not rescue them from danger, but neither may one kill them <i>ab initio</i>.

            "The Gemara returns to discuss the details of the prohibition of robbery mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>, which included actions similar to it. The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to robbery,</b> to <b>what</b> actions <b>similar to it is</b> the <i>baraita</i> referring? <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov says: It is necessary only to</b> teach the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a laborer</b> working <b>in a vineyard</b> who eats from the fruit of the vineyard; his action is similar to robbery, and it is prohibited for a gentile to do so.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>When</b> does this <b>laborer in a vineyard</b> eat from the fruit? <b>If</b> he does so <b>at the time of the completion of</b> the <b>work,</b> i.e., while he is harvesting the fruit, <b>it is permitted</b> for him to do so, just as a Jew working for another Jew is allowed to do so. <b>If it is not at the time of the completion of</b> its <b>work,</b> eating the fruit <b>is full-fledged robbery,</b> and there is no novel element to this case.",
            "<b>Rather, Rav Pappa says</b> that the mention in the <i>baraita</i> of actions similar to robbery <b>is necessary only to</b> teach the <i>halakha</i> of one who robs another of <b>less than the value of one <i>peruta</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> why does the <i>baraita</i> state that it is <b>prohibited</b> for <b>a gentile</b> to do so <b>to a Jew? Isn’t</b> a Jew <b>apt to forgive</b> such a tiny debt? Why is this considered robbery? The Gemara answers: <b>Although afterward</b> the owner <b>forgives him, does he not incur distress at the time of</b> the robbery? Consequently, at the time of the robbery the robber commits a transgression and is liable to be punished for it.",
            "The Gemara challenges: If the mention of actions <b>similar to</b> robbery is referring to the robbery of less than the value of one <i>peruta</i>, what is the novel element in the case of <b>a gentile</b> who robs <b>a gentile?

            "<b>Rather, Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, says</b> that there is a different explanation: <b>It is necessary only to</b> teach the <i>halakha</i> of one who <b>withholds the wages of a hired laborer;</b> for <b>a gentile</b> to do so <b>to</b> another <b>gentile and</b> for <b>a gentile</b> to do so <b>to a Jew is prohibited,</b> but for <b>a Jew</b> to do so <b>to a gentile is permitted.</b> This case is less obvious than other types of robbery, as instead of taking an item from the victim, the robber withholds money that is due to the victim.",
            "The Gemara clarifies further: <b>What is</b> the action that is <b>similar to</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>a beautiful woman</b> who is a prisoner of war, to which the <i>baraita</i> is referring? <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> In the case of <b>a descendant of Noah who designated a maidservant</b> as a mate <b>for his slave, and</b> then he himself <b>engaged in intercourse with her, he is executed on her account.</b> Although the maidservant is his property and is not the slave’s full-fledged wife, nevertheless, he is guilty of adultery.",

With regard to the verse: “Take heed to yourself that you not be ensnared to follow them…saying, <b>how do</b> these nations <b>serve</b> their gods, so I will do likewise” (Deuteronomy 12:30), which indicates that one is liable for worshipping an idol in the manner that the gentiles worship it, this is stated <b>to exclude what?</b>",
            "<b>And if you would say</b> that this verse is stated <b>to exclude one who defecates before</b> an idol that is worshipped by <b>sacrificing</b> offerings, it is not necessary to derive this <i>halakha</i> from this verse, as <b>it is derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>bowing</b> to an idol, as follows: <b>Just as bowing is an honorable</b> form of worship and is punishable by death, <b>so too, any honorable</b> form of worship is punishable by death when performed as idol worship, which excludes an offensive act such as defecating. Therefore, the <i>halakha</i> that one is not liable for defecating before an idol can be derived from bowing.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> this verse is stated <b>to exclude one who defecates before</b> the idol called <b>Mercury,</b> which is not its typical manner of worship. It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since</b> the standard manner of <b>worship</b> of Mercury, namely, throwing stones at it, <b>is</b> in any event an act of <b>degradation, so too,</b> one who performs <b>any</b> act of <b>degradation</b> as worship of Mercury should be liable. Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that one is liable only for worshiping Mercury in its standard manner of worship.",
            "The Gemara raises an objection: <b>But</b> Rava bar Rav Ḥanan’s interpretation of the verses appears to contradict <b>that which Rabbi Eliezer says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> one who <b>sacrifices an animal to Mercury is liable? As it is stated: “And they shall no longer sacrifice their sacrifices to the satyrs”</b> (Leviticus 17:7).",
            "Rabbi Eliezer explains: <b>If</b> the verse <b>is not</b> needed for the <b>matter of</b> one who worships an idol <b>in its</b> typical <b>manner,</b> i.e., one who sacrifices an animal as an offering to an idol that is worshipped by sacrificing offerings, <b>as</b> the <i>halakha</i> in this case <b>is</b> already <b>written</b> in the aforementioned verse: <b>“How do</b> these nations <b>serve</b> their gods, so I will do likewise,” <b>apply it to</b> the <b>matter</b> of one who worships an idol <b>not in its</b> typical <b>manner,</b> by sacrificing an offering to an idol that is not typically worshipped by sacrificing offerings. Therefore, one who sacrifices an offering to Mercury is liable, even though that is not its typical form of worship.",
            "According to Rava bar Rav Ḥanan, by contrast, <b>it is derived</b> that one is liable for worshipping an idol in any honorable manner, even <b>not in its</b> typical <b>manner</b> of worship, <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>bowing.</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the verse mentioned by Rabbi Eliezer, the reference is <b>to one who sacrifices</b> an offering to Mercury not as a form of worship, but rather <b>in order to express insolence</b> toward the Torah prohibition against sacrificing an offering to an idol. It is derived from the verse that this too is a transgression of the prohibition and renders one liable for the death penalty.",
            "§ The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Hamnuna lost his oxen</b> and went to search for them. <b>Rabba met him</b> and <b>raised</b> a contradiction <b>between</b> two <b><i>mishnayot</i>.

By inference, one who <b>worships</b> idols, <b>yes,</b> he is liable, but one who merely <b>says</b> that he will worship idols is <b>not</b> liable. <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in another mishna (67a): <b>One who says: I will worship</b> an idol, or: <b>I will go and worship</b> an idol, or: <b>Let us go and worship</b> an idol, is liable, just as one who actually worships an idol is liable. Evidently, one is liable for merely stating his intention to engage in idol worship.",
            "Rav Hamnuna <b>said to him:</b> The mishna here is referring <b>to one who states: I</b> intend to <b>accept</b> this idol <b>upon myself</b> as a god <b>only through worship.</b> Consequently, he is liable only when he actually worships it. One who intends to accept the idol as a god immediately is liable even before he actually worships it.",
            "<b>Rav Yosef said:</b> This answer is unnecessary; <b>have you removed the <i>tanna’im</i> from the world?

            "The Gemara explains: In a case <b>where</b> those to whom the inciter spoke subsequently <b>worshiped</b> him, <b>everyone agrees</b> that the inciter is liable, <b>as it is written: “You shall not make yourself a graven image”</b> (Exodus 20:4), which is interpreted to include a case where one establishes himself as a god. <b>When they disagree</b> is in a case where the incident ended <b>in mere speech.

            "<b>Rav Yosef then said</b> after reconsidering the matter: <b>What I said is not correct, as even according to Rabbi Yehuda, one is deemed liable for speech as well.

This was done <b>to</b> teach that that the prohibition against kindling a fire on Shabbat is unlike other prohibited labors, as it is an ordinary <b>prohibition,</b> for which one is not liable to be killed by stoning.

            "<b>And Rabbi Natan says:</b> Kindling a fire is like any other labor prohibited on Shabbat, and <b>it was singled out to divide</b> the prohibited labors of Shabbat.

Consequently, one who unwittingly violates several categories of labor is obligated to bring a sin-offering for each and every act of prohibited labor.",

            "Whereas, <b>according to the one who says</b> that <b>kindling</b> a fire <b>was singled out to divide</b> the prohibited labors of Shabbat, <b>bowing was also singled out to divide</b> the rites of idol worship, i.e., to teach that one who unwittingly performs several forms of idol worship is obligated to bring a sin-offering for each and every act of idol worship. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> taught by Rabbi Zakkai, which states that such a person is obligated to bring only one sin-offering, is in accordance with the former opinion, i.e., the opinion of Rabbi Yosei.",
            "<b>Rav Yosef objects to this: Perhaps Rabbi Yosei says there,</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat, that <b>kindling</b> a fire <b>was singled out to</b> teach that it is an ordinary <b>prohibition only because he derives the division of labors</b> on Shabbat, i.e., that one is obligated to bring an offering for each category of labor that he violated, <b>from</b> a different verse, namely: <b>“From one of them”</b> (Leviticus 4:2).",

            "Rabbi Yonatan delineates the implementation of this principle with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat: <b>“One”</b> complete violation is, e.g., a case where one wrote a whole word as he intended, such as the name <b>Shimon.</b> The term <b>“from one”</b> is referring to a case where one performed only part of a complete act of labor, e.g., he wrote only some of the letters of a word, such as <b><i>shin mem</i>, from</b> the name <b>Shimon.</b> These two letters spell the word <i>shem</i>. In such a case, one is obligated to bring an offering for his transgression of writing two letters, <i>shin</i> and <i>mem</i>, even though he did not complete his intended act of writing the entire name of Shimon.",
            "Rabbi Yonatan continues: <b>“Them”</b> is referring to the <b>primary categories</b> of labor. The term <b>“of them”</b> includes the <b>subcategories</b> of labor. The cases of <b>one</b> transgression <b>that</b> with regard to punishment <b>is them,</b> i.e., it is counted as many transgressions, are those involving <b>intention,</b> i.e., awareness, on the part of the transgressor that it was <b>Shabbat and unawareness</b> on the part of the transgressor that the <b>acts of labor</b> that he was performing are prohibited on Shabbat. One who transgresses in this way is obligated to bring a sin-offering for each and every category of labor that he engages in. The cases of <b>them,</b> several transgressions, <b>that</b> with regard to punishment <b>are one</b> are those involving <b>unawareness</b> on the part of the transgressor that it was <b>Shabbat and intention,</b> i.e., awareness, that the <b>acts of labor</b> that he was performing are prohibited on Shabbat.

            "Rav Yosef concludes his objection to Rabbi Abba’s comparison between the status of the prohibition against kindling a fire on Shabbat and the status of the prohibition against bowing to an idol: The fact that Rabbi Yosei derives that kindling a fire on Shabbat is not punishable by death can be attributed to the fact that he derives from a different verse that one who violates several categories of labor is obligated to bring a sin-offering for each and every category of labor that he engages in. <b>But here,</b> with regard to idol worship, <b>where he does not derive the division of labors,</b> i.e., the division of categories of idol worship, <b>from another place,</b> perhaps <b>everyone</b> agrees <b>that bowing was singled out to divide</b> the prohibition of idol worship into different categories and bowing to an idol is punishable by death just like other forms of worship.",
            "The Gemara asks according to both opinions, that of Rav Abba and that of Rav Yosef: Why not <b>derive the division of labors with regard to idol worship, too, from</b> the same verse from which Rabbi Yosei derives the division of labors with regard to Shabbat, namely: “From <b>one of them”?</b> Since this verse is not referring to the <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat in particular, it can be interpreted with regard to idol worship in the same manner that it is interpreted with regard to Shabbat: The word <b>“one”</b> is referring to one complete, prohibited act of worship, such as <b>sacrificing</b> an animal as an idolatrous offering. The term <b>“from one”</b> is referring to one who performs part of an act of worship, e.g., one who did not finish slaughtering the offering, as he severed only <b>one of the organs,</b> i.e., the windpipe and gullet, that must be severed in ritual slaughter.",
            "The word <b>“them”</b> is referring to the <b>primary categories</b> of idol worship that are derived from the manner in which God is worshipped in the Temple, namely, <b>sacrificing</b> an animal as an offering, <b>burning</b> incense, <b>pouring</b> a libation, <b>and bowing.</b> The term <b>“of them”</b> is referring to the <b>subcategories</b> of idol worship, e.g., one who <b>broke a stick before</b> an idol that is worshipped in such a manner. Breaking a stick is a subcategory of sacrificing, as an animal’s neck is broken when it is slaughtered.",
            "The principle of <b>one</b> transgression <b>that</b> with regard to punishment <b>is them,</b> i.e., many, can be applied to a case of <b>intention,</b> i.e., awareness, on the part of the transgressor that <b>idol worship</b> is prohibited, <b>and unawareness</b> that the particular <b>rites</b> of worship that he was performing are prohibited. The principle of <b>them,</b> several transgressions, <b>that</b> with regard to punishment <b>are one</b> can be applied to a case of <b>unawareness</b> with regard to the prohibition of <b>idol worship,</b> i.e., the transgressor was unaware that idol worship is prohibited or that he was worshipping an idol, <b>and intention,</b> i.e., awareness, that the <b>rites</b> that he was performing are prohibited.",
            "The Gemara responds to the suggestion that the division of categories of idol worship can be derived from this verse: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>unawareness</b> with regard to <b>idol worship? If</b> the transgressor <b>thought</b> that a certain building was <b>a synagogue and bowed to it,</b> and he then realized that it is a house of idol worship, he is certainly exempt, as <b>his heart</b> was directed <b>toward Heaven.</b>",
            "<b>Rather,</b> it must be a case <b>where</b> the transgressor <b>saw a statue [<i>andarta</i>]</b> of a person <b>and bowed to it.</b> This case must also be clarified: <b>If he accepted</b> that person <b>upon himself</b> as a god, <b>he is an intentional</b> transgressor and is liable to receive the death penalty, not to bring an offering. <b>If he did not accept him upon himself</b> as a god, but rather bowed to the statue in order to honor the person, what he did <b>is nothing.</b>",
            "<b>Rather,</b> it is clearly a case where one worshipped an idol <b>due to love or due to fear</b> of someone, and he was unaware that this is prohibited. <b>This works out well according to Abaye, who says</b> that one who engages in idol worship due to love or fear is <b>liable;</b> accordingly, one who does so unwittingly must bring an offering. <b>But according to Rava, who says</b> that one who does so is <b>exempt, what can be said?</b>",
            "<b>Rather,</b> according to Rava, unawareness with regard to idol worship can be explained as referring to a case <b>where</b> the transgressor <b>says</b> to himself that idol worship is <b>permitted</b> in general. If so, one can <b>resolve the dilemma that Rava raised before Rav Naḥman: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if one who violated Shabbat <b>has a lapse of awareness of</b> both <b>this,</b> i.e., that it was Shabbat, <b>and that,</b> i.e., that the particular labor that he performed is prohibited on Shabbat?",
            "Rava’s dilemma had been left unresolved.

The fact that Rava’s dilemma had been left unresolved therefore serves as a challenge to this interpretation. The Gemara refutes this challenge: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult;</b> indeed, <b>resolve</b> the dilemma from here.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But can you interpret these verses,</b> namely, “and performs from one of them,” <b>with regard to idol worship</b> at all? <b>As here,</b> in Leviticus, chapter 4, where this verse is written, <b>it is written with regard to an anointed priest,</b> i.e., the High Priest, stating that if he sinned unwittingly he brings <b>a bull</b> as a sin-offering, <b>and with regard to a king</b> who sinned unwittingly it is stated that he brings <b>a goat</b> as a sin-offering, <b>and with regard to</b> an ordinary <b>individual</b> it is stated that he brings <b>a female lamb or a female goat.</b>",

            "The Gemara concludes: <b>And</b> there is <b>nothing more</b> to be discussed.

            "The Gemara explains: <b>The one who says</b> that Ham <b>castrated</b> Noah adduces the following proof: <b>Since he injured</b> Noah <b>with</b> respect to the possibility of conceiving <b>a fourth</b> son, which Noah wanted but could no longer have, therefore Noah <b>cursed him by means of</b> Ham’s <b>fourth son.</b> Ham’s sons were Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan (see Genesis 10:6), and of all of these, it was Canaan whom Noah cursed (see Genesis 9:25–28). <b>And the one who says</b> that Ham <b>sodomized</b> Noah <b>learned</b> this from a verbal analogy between the words <b>“and he saw”</b> and <b>“and he saw.” Here it is written: “And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father”; and there it is written: “And Shechem, son of Hamor</b> the Hivite, prince of the country, <b>saw her,</b> and he took her, and lay with her, and afflicted her” (Genesis 34:2).

Ordinarily, one who is liable to receive two punishments for the same offense is administered only the more severe punishment and exempt from the other one.

            "Rav Ḥisda said to those Sages: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that the definition of <b>the initial stage of intercourse is a kiss,</b> i.e., external contact of the sexual organs, as it is inevitable that there will be some slight penetration. <b>But according to the one who said</b> that the definition of <b>the initial stage of intercourse is the insertion of the corona, what is there to say?</b> This stage takes away the woman’s virginity.

The meaning of the word “congregation” written with regard to Korah is derived by means of a verbal analogy to the word “congregation” written with regard to the spies sent out by Moses to scout the land: “How long shall I bear with this evil congregation” (Numbers 14:27). <b>Just as there,</b> the congregation of spies numbered <b>ten, and all</b> were <b>Jews, so too here,</b> concerning the sanctification of God, there must be <b>ten, all of them</b> being <b>Jews.</b>",

Why then did Esther not surrender her life rather than engage in intercourse? The Gemara answers: <b>Abaye says: Esther was</b> merely like <b>natural ground,</b> i.e., she was a passive participant. The obligation to surrender one’s life rather than engage in forbidden sexual intercourse applies only to a man who transgresses the prohibition in an active manner.

            "<b>Rabbi Yirmeya</b> rejects that proof and <b>says: With what are we dealing here?</b> It is a case <b>where</b> the witnesses <b>forewarned</b> the individual that if he violates the prohibition he is liable to be executed, <b>without specification</b> of the mode of execution. <b>And</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>all the others,</b> those who are <b>liable for</b> the various <b>death penalties</b> stated <b>in the Torah</b> other than the inciter to idol worship, the court <b>executes them only when</b> the following elements are present: <b>The congregation,</b> represented by the court, <b>and witnesses, and forewarning</b> just before the defendant commits the transgression. <b>And</b> the court does not execute him <b>unless</b> the witnesses <b>informed</b> the defendant <b>that he is liable</b> to receive <b>the death penalty from</b> the <b>court.

            "Based on the statement of Rabbi Yehuda, it may be inferred that according to the first <i>tanna</i>, although they must inform him that he is liable to be executed, they are not required to inform him of the specific mode of execution. The Gemara explains the basis for the dispute between the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Yehuda: <b>The first <i>tanna</i> derived</b> forewarning <b>from</b> the incident of the <b>wood gatherer</b> (see Numbers 15:32–36), who was executed even though even Moses did not know with which death penalty he was to be executed.

And likewise it says:</b> But as a wife who treacherously departs her husband, <b>you have dealt treacherously with Me, house of Israel, says the Lord</b> (Jeremiah 3:20). <b>“And an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem,” this</b> is a reference to <b>male homosexual intercourse, and likewise it says: “You shall not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; it is an abomination”</b> (Leviticus 18:22). <b>“As Judah has profaned the sacred [<i>kodesh</i>] of the Lord,” this</b> is a reference to <b>a prostitute, and likewise it says: “There shall be no harlot [<i>kedesha</i>] of the daughters of Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:18). <b>“And has engaged in intercourse with the daughter of a strange god,” this</b> is a reference to <b>one who engages in intercourse with a gentile woman.</b>",
            "<b>And it is written thereafter</b> with regard to those enumerated in the verse: <b>“May the Lord excise the man who does this, who calls and who answers from the tents of Jacob, and he who sacrifices a meal-offering to the Lord of hosts”</b> (Malachi 2:12). The Gemara interprets the verse: <b>If he is a Torah scholar, he will have neither one</b> among his descendants <b>who calls</b> and initiates discourse <b>among the Sages, nor one who answers among the students,</b> i.e., one who is capable of answering questions posed by the Sages. <b>If he is a priest, he will not have</b> among his descendants <b>a son who sacrifices a meal-offering to the Lord of hosts.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avuya says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who engages in intercourse with a gentile woman it is as though he married</b> the object of <b>idol worship</b> itself, <b>as it is written: “And has engaged in intercourse with the daughter of a strange god.” Does a strange god have a daughter? Rather, this</b> is a reference to <b>one who engages in intercourse with a gentile woman</b> who is an adherent of a strange god.",

The Gemara relates: <b>The grandfather of Rabbi Perida,</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avuya, <b>found a skull that was cast at the gates of Jerusalem, and upon it was written: This and yet another. He buried it, and it then emerged [<i>navug</i>]</b> from beneath the soil. <b>He buried it and it then emerged</b> from beneath the soil again. <b>He said: This is the skull of Jehoiakim, as it is written in his regard: “With the burial of a donkey he shall be buried, drawn and cast beyond the gates of Jerusalem”</b> (Jeremiah 22:19).

            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> prove that one is executed by strangulation for striking his father or mother even if he does not kill them <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it is written: “One who strikes a man and he dies shall be put to death”</b> (Exodus 21:12), <b>and it is written: “Or if in enmity he struck him with his hand and he died</b> he shall be put to death” (Numbers 35:21). <b>Learn from</b> these verses in which it states: Strikes and he dies, that <b>anywhere that there is</b> mention of <b>striking without specifying</b> a resultant death, <b>it is not</b> referring to a case where the blow caused one’s <b>death.</b>",
            "The Gemara notes: <b>And it was necessary</b> for the Torah <b>to write: “One who strikes a man,” and it was necessary</b> for the Torah <b>to write: “Anyone who kills a soul,</b> the murderer shall be slain on the basis of witnesses” (Numbers 35:30), <b>since if the Merciful One wrote</b> only: <b>“One who strikes a man and he dies,” I would say</b> that one who strikes <b>a man,</b> i.e., an adult, <b>who is obligated in</b> the fulfillment of <b>mitzvot, yes,</b> he is executed, but one who kills <b>a minor, no,</b> he is not executed. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes: “Anyone who kills a soul.” And if the Merciful One wrote</b> only: <b>“Anyone who kills a soul,” I would say</b> that one is executed <b>even</b> if he killed <b>a non-viable newborn, or even</b> if he killed a child <b>born after</b> a gestation period of <b>eight</b> months, who, in talmudic times, was also considered non-viable. Consequently, both verses <b>are necessary.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if that is the source for the <i>halakha</i> that one is liable for striking his father or mother, why not <b>say</b> that he is liable <b>even though he did not wound him</b> or her and draw blood? <b>Why,</b> then, <b>did we learn</b> in a mishna (85b): <b>One who strikes his father and his mother is not liable unless he wounds them?</b>",
            "The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states: “And one who strikes an animal</b> shall pay for it; <b>and one who strikes a person</b> shall be put to death” (Leviticus 24:21), juxtaposing one who strikes an individual with one who strikes an animal. An earlier verse states: “One who strikes the soul of an animal shall pay for it” (Leviticus 24:18). Based on this it is derived: <b>Just as one who strikes an animal</b> is not liable <b>unless he wounds it</b> and draws blood, <b>as “soul” is written concerning it,</b> and it can be derived from the verse: “For the blood is the soul” (Deuteronomy 12:23), that the term “soul” is a reference to blood, <b>so too, one who strikes a person</b> is not liable <b>unless he causes a wound</b> and draws blood.",
            "<b>Rav Yirmeya objects to this</b> proof: <b>If that is so,</b> then in a case where <b>one weakened</b> the animal <b>by</b> placing a burden of <b>stones</b> upon it and thereby injured or killed it, would one say <b>that so too</b> in that case <b>he is not liable</b> because he did not draw blood? Clearly he is liable to pay for the damage that he caused. <b>Rather,</b> with regard to the term soul in the verse: “One who strikes the soul of an animal,” <b>if it is not a matter</b> that is relevant <b>to the soul of an animal, as even</b> in a case where <b>one weakens</b> the animal <b>by</b> placing a burden of <b>stones</b> upon it, he is <b>liable, apply it to the matter of the soul of a person,</b> and thereby derive that one who strikes his parent is liable to be executed only if he wounds his parent and draws blood.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if the fact that one who strikes his parent is liable only if he draws blood is derived based on the principle: If it is not a matter, <b>why do I</b> need the <b>juxtaposition</b> between the striking of a man and the striking of an animal? The Gemara answers: The juxtaposition is necessary in order to derive the <i>halakha</i> <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in the school of Ḥizkiyya:</b> Just as in the case of one who strikes an animal there is no distinction between one who does so unwittingly and one who does so intentionally, and in both cases he is liable to pay damages, so too, in the case of one who strikes a person there is no distinction between one who does so intentionally and is executed, and one who does so unwittingly and is not executed. In both cases he is exempt from paying damages based on the principle that one receives only the greater punishment.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who holds</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the <i>tanna</i> of the school of Ḥizkiyya, but according to the one who does not hold</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the <i>tanna</i> of the school of Ḥizkiyya, why do I</b> need the <b>juxtaposition</b> between the striking of a man and the striking of an animal?",
            "The Gemara answers: He derives that <b>just as one who strikes an animal for medical</b> purposes is <b>exempt</b> from payment of restitution, <b>so too, one who strikes a person for medical</b> purposes is <b>exempt,</b> even if it results in the death of the one that he treated.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>As a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>whether a son may let blood for his father?</b> Is he liable for wounding his father? <b>Rav Mattana says</b> that it is written: <b>“And you shall love your neighbor as yourself”</b> (Leviticus 19:18); just as one would want others to heal him when the need arises, one must heal others when the need arises. It is prohibited for one to do to others only those actions that he would not want done to him. Therefore, it is permitted for one to heal his father even if the procedure entails wounding him. <b>Rav Dimi bar Ḥinnana says:</b> This is derived from the juxtaposition between <b>one who strikes a person and one who strikes an animal.

            "The Gemara relates: <b>Rav did not allow his son to extract a thorn from him,</b> due to the concern that his son would unwittingly wound him. <b>Mar, son of Ravina, did not allow his son to pierce his blister, lest he wound</b> him, which <b>would be an unwitting</b> violation of <b>a prohibition.</b>",
            "The Gemara challenges this: <b>If so,</b> this should be a concern when <b>another</b> who is not his son treats him <b>as well,</b> as it is prohibited for one Jew to injure another. The Gemara explains: There is a distinction, as when <b>another</b> treats him, the concern is that the individual would be in <b>unwitting</b> violation of <b>a prohibition.</b> By contrast, when <b>his son</b> treats him, the concern is that he would be in <b>unwitting</b> violation of a prohibition punishable by <b>strangulation.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> with regard to that <b>which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 122b): It is permitted on Shabbat to move an ordinary <b>hand needle</b> used for sewing garments <b>to extract a thorn with it,</b> why is it permitted to extract a thorn on Shabbat? <b>Let us be concerned lest he wound</b> the individual in the process, which <b>would be an unwitting</b> violation of a prohibition punishable by <b>stoning.</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> even if one wounds the individual, <b>he is</b> unwittingly performing a labor for <b>a destructive</b> purpose, i.e., he is causing an injury, and one is liable to be executed only for the performance of a labor for a constructive purpose on Shabbat.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who said</b> that one who performs a labor on Shabbat for <b>a destructive</b> purpose is <b>exempt.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>Whom did you hear that said</b> that <b>one who is destructive in</b> causing <b>a wound</b> is <b>liable</b> to be executed if there is a constructive element to his action? <b>It is Rabbi Shimon,</b>"

            "§ The Sages <b>raised a dilemma before Rav Sheshet: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to whether <b>a son may be designated an agent</b> of the court in order <b>to flog his father or to curse him</b> if the court sentenced him to ostracism?",
            "Rav Sheshet <b>said to them: And did</b> the Torah render it <b>permitted</b> to flog or curse <b>another</b> who is not his father? The Torah prohibited such actions. <b>Rather,</b> the reason that an agent of the court may flog or curse the one found liable is that <b>the honor of Heaven takes precedence</b> over the honor due to another. <b>Here too,</b> a son may serve as an agent of the court because <b>the honor of Heaven takes precedence</b> over the honor due to his father.",
            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And just as</b> with regard to one <b>who is commanded to strike him</b> there is <b>a mitzva not to strike him</b> under other circumstances, with regard to one <b>who is not commanded to strike him is it not right that there is a mitzva not to strike him?</b>",

The distinction between them is that <b>this</b> latter clause, which is referring to one who is not commanded to strike him, is concerning a case <b>where</b> the agent is <b>his son</b> and is therefore prohibited from striking his father even in that capacity, while <b>that</b> first clause, which is referring to one who is commanded to strike him, is concerning a case <b>where</b> the agent is <b>another</b> individual and not his son. This indicates that it is prohibited for a son to flog his father as an agent of the court.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> in both <b>this</b> clause <b>and that</b> clause <b>it is no different</b> if the agent is <b>his son and it is no different</b> if the agent is <b>another.

            "The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Rav Sheshet interprets</b> this <i>baraita</i> as referring to a case <b>where they are not imploring him to emerge</b> from the court for his execution. It is referring to a case where the condemned man is proceeding willingly, and it is not an agent of the court but someone else who strikes and curses him at his own initiative.",
            "The Gemara challenges: <b>If so, even another</b> who strikes one who is condemned to death should be liable, as it is prohibited to strike or curse another. The Gemara responds: If <b>another</b> does so he is exempt, since the legal status of the one condemned to death <b>is</b> that of <b>a dead man.</b> Therefore, one is not liable for striking or humiliating him.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t Rav Sheshet</b> himself <b>say:</b> If <b>one humiliates</b> another who is <b>sleeping</b> and the individual never awakens <b>and dies,</b> the one who humiliated him is <b>liable</b> to compensate his heirs for that humiliation? Apparently, even if the status of the condemned is that of a dead person, the one who cursed him should be liable to compensate his heirs.

Why does the <i>baraita</i> exempt another entirely? The Gemara explains: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the term <b>exempt that is stated</b> in this <i>baraita</i>? It means that he is <b>exempt from monetary restitution,</b> but he is liable to receive lashes.",
            "The Gemara asks: If the clause of the <i>baraita</i> that discusses a case where another individual strikes or curses him and states that he is exempt only from payment of restitution, one may conclude <b>by inference that</b> the clause of the <i>baraita</i> that discusses <b>his son</b> states that he is <b>liable</b> to pay <b>monetary restitution.</b> That is certainly not the case. <b>Rather,</b> the clause of the <i>baraita</i> that discusses his son states that he is liable to be punished <b>in accordance with his</b> appropriate <b>sentence; here too,</b> the clause of the <i>baraita</i> that discusses another individual states that he is exempt from punishment <b>in accordance with his</b> appropriate <b>sentence.</b> The question remains: Why is another exempt from receiving lashes in a case where he struck him with a blow that does not have sufficient force to cause damage worth one <i>peruta</i>?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, this is the reason that</b> another <b>is exempt: As the verse states: “Nor curse a ruler of your people”</b> (Exodus 22:27), from which it is inferred that this prohibition applies only <b>with regard to one who performs an action of “your people,”</b> i.e., an action befitting a Jew. There is no prohibition against cursing one whose actions are inconsistent with the conduct appropriate for a Jew.",

            "The Gemara challenges: <b>If so,</b> and the prohibition does not apply to one whose actions are inconsistent with the conduct appropriate for a Jew, <b>his son too</b> should be exempt if he strikes or curses his father whose conduct is inappropriate.

            "The Gemara challenges: <b>If so,</b> and the <i>baraita</i> is referring to one who repented, <b>another</b> should be rendered liable <b>as well.

        [
            "The Gemara answers: The <i>halakha</i> here is <b>just as it is after</b> the <b>death</b> of his father, and the son is liable for cursing his father even after his death. Therefore, he is also liable when his father’s death is imminent.",
            "Despite several attempts to cite proof contradicting his opinion, there is no conclusive refutation of the statement of Rav Sheshet that a son may serve as an agent of the court to punish his father. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> halakhic conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about</b> this matter? <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna says, and likewise the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: With regard to all</b> cases <b>a son is not designated</b> as <b>an agent to strike his father or to curse him, except</b> in a case where his father <b>incites</b> others to worship idols, <b>as the Torah states: “Neither shall you spare, nor shall you conceal him”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:9).",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who strikes his father or his mother is not liable</b> to be executed <b>unless he wounds</b> one of <b>them.

The Gemara asks: Is that a shortcoming? King <b>David also said: “Remember me, Lord, when You show favor to Your people; visit me with Your salvation”</b> (Psalms 106:4).

            "The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> Daniel was <b>greater than he</b> was?

            "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>“This very day shall he halt at Nov”</b> (Isaiah 10:32)? <b>Rav Huna says: That</b> was the final <b>day</b> that <b>remained from</b> the punishment that the Jewish people received from <b>the sin of Nov</b> (see I Samuel, chapter 22). <b>The astrologers said to</b> Sennacherib: <b>If you go</b> and conquer them <b>now, you will overcome</b> the Jewish people; <b>and if not, you will not overcome</b> the Jewish people.

            "God said to David: Your arrival in Nov and your misleading Ahimelech the priest generated the chain of events, and therefore you must be punished.

            "Apropos David’s prayer that his descendants cease, the Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that David’s descendants ceased</b> to exist? It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “And Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, and she arose and destroyed all the royal descendants”</b> (II Kings 11:1).

The Gemara asks: <b>Due to</b> the fact that <b>Hezekiah had been ill and was recovered, he sent him a letter and a gift?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> and he did so in order <b>“to inquire of the wonder that was in the land”</b> (II Chronicles 32:31). <b>As Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> On <b>that day that</b> Hezekiah’s father, <b>Ahaz, died,</b> daylight lasted <b>two hours,</b> ten hours shorter than the standard day, so that the wicked Ahaz would be buried hurriedly, without the pomp typically accorded kings.",

            "<b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> An <i>epikoros</i> <b>is one who calls his teacher by his name</b> and does not call him Rabbi, <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: For what</b> reason <b>was Gehazi punished?</b> It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that he called his teacher by his name, as it is stated: “And Gehazi said: My lord the king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha revived”</b> (II Kings 8:5).",

            "§ The Gemara returns to its interpretation of verses in Lamentations: <b>“She cries [<i>bakho tivke</i>] at night”</b> (Lamentations 1:2). <b>These two cries,</b> indicated by the use of a compound verb, <b>why</b> are they written? <b>Rabba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: One</b> is a cry <b>over</b> the destruction of <b>the First Temple, and one</b> is a cry <b>over</b> the destruction of <b>the Second Temple,</b> which was destined to be destroyed.
