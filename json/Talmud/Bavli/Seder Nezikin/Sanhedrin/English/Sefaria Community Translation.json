However, what does [Rabbi Yoshayah] do [with the word] \"to incline\"?  He assigns it to capital cases ",

If a matter of inquiry arose, the local Beit Din was consulted.  If they had a tradition they stated it; if not, they went to the nearest Beth Din.  If they had a tradition, they stated it; if not, they went to the one situated at the entrance of the Court, and he declared, “Thus I have expounded, and thus have my colleagues expounded; thus have I taught and thus have they taught.”  If they had a tradition, they stated it, and if not, they all proceeded to the Hall of Hewn Stones, where they (Sanhedrin) sat from the morning tamid, until the evening tamid.  On Shabbat and festivals they sat within the hel.  The question was then put before them; if they had a tradition they stated it; if not, they took a vote: if the majority voted “unclean” they declared it so; if “clean” they ruled so.

Whilst as for the party which said, ‘Let us ascend and serve idols’ — ‘for there the Lord did confound the language of all the earth.’ It has been taught: Rabbi Natan said: They were all bent on idolatry. Here it is written, ‘let us make us a name,’ while elsewhere it is written, ‘…and make no mention of the name of other gods’ (Shemot 23:13). Just as there (in Shemot) [it means] idolatry, 20 so too here [it means] idolatry.  Rabbi Yochanan said: A third of the tower was burnt, a third sunk [into the earth], and a third is still standing.  Rav said: The atmosphere of the tower causes forgetfulness. Rav Yosef said: Bavel and Borsif are bad omens for Torah. What [is the meaning of the name] Borsif? Rabbi Assi said: An empty well. ",

            "\"I appeared unto Abraham\": Said the Holy One blessed be He to Moses: Alas for those who are gone, never to be replaced (in reference to the Patriarchs)!  Many times I revealed myself to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob as God Almighty (El Shadai), but I did not make known to them that My name is the lord as I have told thee and they did not question my ways.  I said to Abraham: (Gen 13) \"Arise and go forth in the land the length and breadth...for to thee shall I give it\" - He sought to bury Sarah and did not find where, until he purchased a place with money - yet he did not question my ways.\"  I said to Isaac (Gen 26): \"Dwell in this land...for to thee and thy seed shall I give all these lands\" - He sought to drink water and did not find, \"And the shepherds of Gerar strove with the shepherds of Isaac\" - yet he did not question my ways.  I said unto Jacob (Gen 29): \"The land which thouh liest on, to thee will I give it and unto thy seed\" - He sought a place to pitch his tent and did not find until he acquired it for a hundred kesitah - yet he did not question my ways, and did not ask Me what was My name as you have asked.  Yet you at the beginning of My mission did say to Me, \"What is His name?\"  And at the end you  did say (Exodus 5:23): \"Since I came to speak in Your name, he has done evil to this people.\" (Genesis Rabbah 6:4)"
