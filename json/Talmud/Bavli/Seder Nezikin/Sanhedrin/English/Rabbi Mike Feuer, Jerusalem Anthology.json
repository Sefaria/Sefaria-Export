When it is said “The hand upon the throne of the Lord, the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation,” (Shemot 17:16) we learn that ",
            "the appointing of a king comes first, because ‘throne’ indicates a king, as it is written “Then Shlomo sat on the throne of the Lord to rule.” (Divre HaYamim I 24:23) ",
            "But I still do not know which of the other two comes first, building the Chosen House or destroying the seed of Amalek. When it is written “and He will give you rest from all your enemies surrounding you, and you will dwell securely. Then it shall come to pass that the place which the Lord your God shall choose…” (Devarim 12:10-11) it means that  the extermination of Amalek is first. ",
            "And so it says about David  “And it came to pass, when the king dwelt in his house, and the Lord had given him rest round about from all his enemies,” and it is further written “That the king said unto Nathan the prophet; ‘See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within the curtains.’” (Shmuel II 7:1-2)"
