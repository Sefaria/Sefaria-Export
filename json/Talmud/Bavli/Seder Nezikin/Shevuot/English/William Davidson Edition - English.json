            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>oaths</b> on an utterance of the lips, there are <b>two</b> types <b>that are</b> actually <b>four</b> types. The Torah specifies only two types of oaths whose violation renders one liable to bring a sliding-scale offering to atone for his transgression (see Leviticus 5:4): Where a person takes an oath to perform some action, and where he takes an oath to refrain from performing some action. With regard to both types, the Torah explicitly mentions liability only for an oath pertaining to one’s future behavior. Nevertheless, the Sages derive that one is also liable for a violation of both types of oaths when they pertain to one’s past behavior. Accordingly, although only two types are explicitly mentioned in the Torah, the Sages derive that there are actually four types.",
            "The mishna lists similar groups of <i>halakhot</i>. With regard to cases of <b>awareness of the defiling</b> of the Temple by entering it while one is ritually impure, or defiling its sacrificial foods by partaking of them while one is ritually impure, there are <b>two</b> types <b>that are</b> actually <b>four.</b> It is prohibited for an impure person to enter the Temple (see Numbers 19:20) or to partake of its sacrificial foods (see Leviticus 7:19–20). If one transgressed either prohibition during a lapse of awareness, then upon becoming aware of his transgression, he is liable to bring a sliding-scale offering (see Leviticus 5:2). The Torah specifies that one is liable to bring the offering only in the case in which he had a lapse of awareness of the fact that he was impure. The Sages derive that one is liable not only in these two cases, but also where he was aware of his personal status but had a lapse of awareness concerning the identity of the place he was entering or the status of the foods he ate.",
            "With regard to acts of <b>carrying out</b> that are prohibited <b>on Shabbat,</b> there are <b>two</b> types <b>that are</b> actually <b>four.</b> On Shabbat, it is prohibited to transfer an item from domain to domain. The Torah explicitly refers to only two cases, both of which involve an item being transferred from a private domain to a public domain: Where the transfer is made by a person who remains in the public domain, and where the transfer is made by a person who remains in the private domain. The Sages derive that liability is incurred in these cases also if the item is transferred from the public domain to the private domain. Although only two types are mentioned by the Torah, the Sages derive that there are actually four types.",
            "With regard to <b>shades of</b> leprous <b>marks</b> on a person’s skin, there are <b>two</b> types <b>that are</b> actually <b>four.</b> The Torah specifies that if a leprous mark appears on a person’s skin, the afflicted person must undergo a process of purification and then bring various offerings. Part of the classification of these types of leprosy is based on their shade of white. Two types of marks are explicitly mentioned in the Torah, and the Sages derive that each of these two types has a secondary mark.",
            "The mishna returns to the subject of defiling the Temple or its sacrificial foods. It elaborates on which offerings atone for different cases of defiling the Temple or its sacrificial foods: In cases <b>in which</b> one <b>had awareness,</b> i.e., he knew he was ritually impure and was aware of the sanctity of the Temple or foods involved <b>at the beginning,</b> i.e., before he transgressed, <b>and</b> had <b>awareness at the end,</b> i.e., after the transgression, <b>but</b> had <b>a lapse of awareness</b> of one of those two components <b>in between,</b> while he actually transgressed, <b>this</b> person is liable <b>to</b> bring <b>a sliding-scale</b> offering.",
            "For cases <b>in which</b> one <b>had awareness at the beginning,</b> transgressed during a lapse of awareness, <b>and</b> still <b>had no awareness at the end,</b> the <b>goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary on Yom Kippur, <b>and Yom Kippur</b> itself, <b>suspend</b> any punishment that he deserves <b>until he becomes aware</b> of his transgression; <b>and</b> then to achieve atonement <b>he brings a sliding-scale</b> offering.",
            "For cases in which one <b>did not have awareness at the beginning but had awareness at the end,</b> the <b>goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed outside</b> the Sanctuary, i.e., the goat of the additional offerings of Yom Kippur, <b>and Yom Kippur</b> itself, <b>atone, as it is stated</b> with regard to the offerings brought on Yom Kippur: “One goat for a sin-offering <b>aside from the sin-offering of the atonements”</b> (Numbers 29:11). The verse juxtaposes the internal and external goats together to teach that <b>for that which this</b> one <b>atones, that</b> one <b>atones. Just as the internal</b> goat, i.e., the one whose blood presentation is performed inside the Sanctuary, <b>atones only for a case in which there was awareness</b> of the components of the transgression at some point, i.e., at the beginning, <b>so too, the external</b> goat, i.e., the goat of the additional offerings of Yom Kippur, <b>atones only for a case in which there was awareness</b> at some point, i.e., at the end.",
            "<b>And for</b> cases in <b>which</b> one <b>did not have awareness, neither at the beginning nor at the end,</b> the <b>goats</b> brought as sin-offerings for the additional offerings <b>of the Festivals and</b> the <b>goats</b> brought as sin-offerings for the additional offerings <b>of</b> the <b>New Moons atone.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The <b>goats of the Festivals atone</b> for cases in which one never had awareness of the transgression, <b>but</b> the <b>goats of</b> the <b>New Moons</b> do <b>not.

For example, if a goat was initially consecrated to be sacrificed as part of the Yom Kippur additional offerings, may it be sacrificed as part of the Festival additional offerings instead?

            "<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of</b> Rabbi Shimon a tradition of his opinion that differs from the way the mishna expresses it above: The <b>goats of</b> the <b>New Moons atone for a ritually pure</b> person <b>who</b> unwittingly <b>partook of ritually impure</b> sacrificial food. The goats <b>of</b> the <b>Festivals exceed them, as they atone</b> both <b>for a pure</b> person <b>who partook of impure</b> sacrificial food <b>and</b> also <b>for</b> cases of defiling the Temple or its sacrificial foods <b>in which</b> one <b>did not have awareness, neither at the beginning nor at the end.</b>",
            "The goats <b>of Yom Kippur</b> further <b>exceed them, as they atone</b> both <b>for a ritually pure</b> person <b>who partook of ritually impure</b> sacrificial food <b>and for</b> cases of defiling the Temple or its sacrificial foods <b>in which</b> one <b>did not have awareness, neither at the beginning nor at the end; and</b> they also atone <b>for</b> cases <b>in which</b> one <b>did not have awareness at the beginning but did have awareness at the end.</b>",

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara inquires: <b>Now, the <i>tanna</i> is leaving</b> tractate <b><i>Makkot</i>,</b> the tractate that precedes tractate <i>Shevuot</i> in the mishnaic order. <b>What is distinctive</b> about tractate <i>Shevuot</i> <b>that he teaches</b> tractate <b><i>Shevuot</i></b> after tractate <i>Makkot</i>? The Gemara answers: It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that he teaches</b> in a mishna at the end of tractate <i>Makkot</i> (20a): <b>For</b> rounding the edges of his <b>head</b> one is <b>liable</b> to receive <b>two</b> sets of lashes: <b>One from here,</b> the hair adjacent to one ear, <b>and one from there,</b> the hair adjacent to the other ear."

            "The Gemara explains: As apparent from the mishna in <i>Makkot</i>, this is a case where there is <b>one</b> prohibition <b>for which one is liable</b> to receive <b>two</b> punishments. Continuing on this theme, the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> in the beginning of tractate <i>Shevuot</i> examples of other sets of <i>halakhot</i> that can be formulated similarly, beginning with: With regard to <b>oaths</b> on an utterance, there are <b>two</b> types <b>that are</b> actually <b>four</b> types.",
            "The Gemara inquires: <b>What is different here,</b> in tractate <i>Shevuot</i>, <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches all</b> the sets of <i>halakhot</i> that can be formulated as: Two that are four, <b>and what is different with regard to</b> the chapter beginning: The acts of <b>carrying out</b> that are prohibited <b>on Shabbat,</b> i.e., the first chapter of tractate <i>Shabbat</i>, <b>and</b> the chapter beginning: <b>And</b> the <b>shades of</b> leprous <b>marks,</b> i.e., the first chapter of tractate <i>Nega’im</i>, <b>where</b> the mishna <b>does not teach all of them,</b> rather only the specific set of <i>halakhot</i> relevant to that tractate?",
            "The Sages <b>say</b> in explanation: Since the passages of <b>oaths and</b> of liability based on one’s <b>awareness of the defiling</b> of the Temple or its sacrificial foods <b>are written together</b> in the Torah (see Leviticus 5:2–4), <b>and they are</b> also <b>similar to each other</b> in that they can both incur liability <b>to</b> bring <b>a sliding-scale offering,</b> the mishna therefore <b>taught</b> both of <b>them together</b> here. <b>And once it</b> already <b>taught two</b> sets, it continued and <b>taught all of them.</b>",
            "The Gemara inquires further: Tractate <i>Shevuot</i> <b>opens with</b> a reference to <b>oaths, but</b> then proceeds to <b>explain</b> the cases of one’s <b>awareness of the defiling</b> of the Temple or its sacrificial foods, returning to discuss oaths only in the third chapter. Why? The Gemara explains: <b>Since</b> the <b>cases</b> of one’s awareness of the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods <b>are</b> relatively <b>few,</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>addressed</b> them <b>directly</b> and <b>dispensed with them, and then</b> afterward returned to <b>teach</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>oaths, which have numerous details.</b>",
            "§ The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>oaths</b> on an utterance, there are <b>two</b> types <b>that are</b> actually <b>four</b> types. The Gemara explains: The <b>two</b> types are where one states: On my oath <b>I will eat, and</b> where he states: On my oath <b>I will not eat.</b> If he violates either oath he is liable to bring a sliding-scale offering. These two types <b>are</b> actually <b>four</b> types because they also include the cases where a person falsely states: On my oath <b>I ate, and</b> where he falsely states: On my oath <b>I did not eat.</b>",
            "The mishna continues: With regard to cases of one’s <b>awareness of the defiling</b> of the Temple or its sacrificial foods, for which one is liable to bring a sliding-scale offering, there are <b>two</b> cases <b>that are</b> actually <b>four.</b> The Gemara explains: The <b>two</b> cases are where one’s lack of <b>awareness of</b> the fact that he was <b>ritually impure</b> led him to eat <b>sacrificial</b> food, <b>and</b> where one’s lack of <b>awareness</b> of the fact that he was <b>ritually impure</b> led him to enter the <b>Temple.</b> These two types <b>are</b> actually <b>four</b> types, because one is also liable where he was aware that he was impure, but had a lapse of awareness about the status of the <b>sacrificial</b> food <b>or</b> the identity of the <b>Temple.</b>",
            "The mishna continues: With regard to acts of <b>carrying out</b> that are prohibited <b>on Shabbat,</b> there are <b>two</b> types <b>that are four.</b> The Gemara explains the cases by using the analogy of a poor person who remains in the public domain and a homeowner who remains in the private domain and one passes an item to the other: The <b>two</b> types are the <b>carrying out by a poor person</b> of an item from the private domain to the public domain <b>and</b> the <b>carrying out by a homeowner</b> of an item from the private domain to the public domain. These two types <b>are</b> actually <b>four</b> types because they also include the <b>bringing in by a poor person</b> of an item from the public domain to the private domain <b>and</b> the <b>bringing in by a homeowner</b> of an item from the public domain to the private domain.",
            "The mishna’s final example: With regard to <b>shades of</b> leprous <b>marks,</b> there are <b>two</b> shades <b>that are</b> actually <b>four.</b> The Gemara explains: The <b>two</b> shades are of <b>a wool-white</b> leprous <b>mark [<i>se’et</i>] and</b> of <b>a snow-white</b> leprous <b>mark [<i>baheret</i>].</b> These two <b>are</b> actually <b>four</b> because they also include <b>a <i>se’et</i> and its secondary</b> mark, i.e., one similar to it, and <b>a <i>baheret</i> and its secondary</b> mark, i.e., one similar to it.",
            "§ The Gemara asks: <b>Whose</b> opinion is expressed in <b>the mishna?</b> It is <b>neither</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael nor</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>If</b> one suggests that it is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> that suggestion can be refuted, as <b>doesn’t he say</b> with regard to oaths: <b>One is liable only for</b> oaths pertaining to <b>the future,</b> but not for those pertaining to the past?

And <b>if</b> one suggests it is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> that suggestion can be refuted, as <b>doesn’t he say: For</b> having defiled the Temple or its sacrificial foods during <b>a lapse of awareness of</b> the fact that one is <b>ritually impure</b> one <b>is liable</b> to bring a sliding-scale offering, <b>but</b> one <b>is not liable for</b> having done so during <b>a lapse of awareness of</b> the fact that the place he entered was actually the <b>Temple?</b> The mishna states that one is liable also in such a case.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that the mishna expresses the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> and <b>if you wish, say</b> that the mishna expresses the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>If you wish, say</b> that the mishna expresses the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> and the intent of the mishna is that while there are four types of oaths, <b>among them</b> are types <b>for</b> which there is <b>liability</b> to bring an offering for one who violates them <b>and among them</b> are types <b>for</b> which there is <b>exemption</b> from liability for one who violates them. <b>And if you wish, say</b> that the mishna expresses the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> and the intent of the mishna is that while there are four cases defined by one’s awareness of the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods, <b>among them</b> are cases <b>for</b> which there is <b>liability</b> to bring an offering <b>and among them</b> are cases <b>for</b> which there is <b>exemption</b> from liability.",
            "The Gemara asks: How can one say that the mishna teaches types <b>for</b> which there is <b>exemption</b> from liability?"

        [
            "<b>But</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> these cases <b>similar to</b> the different <b>shades of</b> leprous <b>marks,</b> which indicates that <b>just as there, all</b> four <b>of them</b> are shades <b>for</b> which there is <b>liability</b> to bring an offering, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to oaths and the cases of one’s awareness of the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods, <b>all</b> four <b>of them</b> are cases <b>for</b> which there is <b>liability</b> to bring an offering.",
            "The Gemara suggests a different resolution: <b>Actually,</b> the mishna expresses the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael.

It follows that <b>just as</b> an oath taken in <b>vain pertains to the past</b> and renders one liable to receive lashes, <b>so too,</b> taking <b>a false</b> oath that <b>pertains to the past</b> renders one liable to receive lashes.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Granted</b> that one who stated: On my oath <b>I ate,</b> but in fact he did not eat, <b>or</b> one who stated: On my oath <b>I did not eat,</b> but in fact he ate, is liable to receive lashes, as this is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rava.</b> And <b>also</b> if one stated: On my oath <b>I will not eat, and he ate</b> in violation of his oath, he is liable to receive lashes, as it <b>is a prohibition that involves an action,</b> and, in general, such prohibitions are punishable by flogging. <b>But</b> if one stated: On my oath <b>I will eat, and</b> in violation of his oath <b>he did not eat, why</b> should he be liable to receive lashes? It <b>is a prohibition that does not involve an action.</b> The generally accepted principle is that one is not liable to receive lashes for violating a prohibition without performing an action.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> disagrees with the generally accepted principle and <b>holds</b> that <b>one is flogged for</b> the violation of <b>a prohibition that does not involve an action.</b>",
            "The Gemara challenges: <b>If so,</b> then <b>a difficulty</b> arises between one statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan and</b> another statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b>",
            "<b>As Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is always <b>in accordance with</b> the ruling of <b>an unattributed mishna.</b> Since the mishna here is unattributed and assumes that one is flogged for taking a false oath, Rabbi Yoḥanan should rule that this is the <i>halakha</i>.",
            "<b>And</b> an amoraic dispute <b>was stated</b> with regard to one who said: On my <b>oath I will eat this loaf today, and the day passed and he did not eat it. Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish both say: He is not flogged</b> for taking a false oath. They disagree with regard to the reason that he is not flogged. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: He is not flogged due to</b> the fact <b>that it is a prohibition that does not involve an action,</b> as he violates the oath by failing to perform an action rather than by performing an action, <b>and</b> the principle is: With regard to <b>any prohibition that does not involve an action, one is not flogged for its</b> violation. <b>And Reish Lakish says: He is not flogged</b> because <b>it is an uncertain forewarning,</b> as one cannot forewarn him before he fails to fulfill the oath because as long as time remains in the day he can still later eat the loaf and fulfill the oath; <b>and an uncertain forewarning is not characterized as forewarning.</b> Evidently, Rabbi Yoḥanan does not rule in accordance with the mishna here.",
            "The Gemara resolves the difficulty: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan found another unattributed</b> mishna which holds that one is not flogged for a prohibition that does not involve an action, and he rules in accordance with that mishna.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Which</b> other <b>unattributed</b> mishna did he find? <b>If we say</b> he found <b>this unattributed</b> mishna, <b>as we learned</b> (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 84a): <b>But one who leaves over</b> some of the meat <b>of a ritually pure</b> Paschal offering until the morning of the fifteenth of Nisan <b>and one who breaks</b> a bone <b>of a ritually impure</b> Paschal offering <b>are not flogged</b> with <b>the forty</b> lashes, that is difficult.",
            "First, the Gemara explains how this mishna demonstrates Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion: <b>Granted</b> that <b>breaking</b> a bone <b>of a impure</b> Paschal offering does not incur lashes, <b>as it is written: “Nor shall you break a bone in it”</b> (Exodus 12:46). The term “in it” indicates that the verse refers only <b>to a valid</b> Paschal offering, <b>but not to a disqualified</b> one, such as one that is impure. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>one who leaves over</b> some of the meat <b>of a pure</b> Paschal offering, <b>what is the reason</b> he is not flogged? <b>Is it not because it is</b> a violation of <b>a prohibition that does not involve an action, and for</b> a violation of <b>any prohibition that does not involve an action one is not flogged?</b>",
            "The Gemara now questions this explanation of the mishna: <b>But from where</b> is it apparent that this mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ya’akov, who says</b> that for a violation of <b>a prohibition that does not involve an action, one is not flogged? Perhaps</b> the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and</b> he holds that the reason the mishna rules that one is not flogged is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that the verse comes to position</b> the <b>positive mitzva</b> of burning the leftover meat <b>after</b> the <b>prohibition</b> of leaving over the meat, and one is not flogged for a prohibition whose violation obligates one in a positive mitzva. <b>But were it not for this, one would be flogged,</b> despite the fact it is a prohibition that does not involve an action. Since the unattributed mishna is not necessarily in accordance with Rabbi Yaakov’s opinion, it cannot be the basis of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s ruling.",
            "The Gemara cites the source of Rabbi Yaakov’s and Rabbi Yehuda’s opinions: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “And <b>you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning, and that which remains of it until the morning you shall burn in fire”</b> (Exodus 12:10). <b>The verse comes to position</b> the <b>positive mitzva</b> of burning the leftover meat <b>after</b> the <b>prohibition</b> against leaving over the meat, <b>to say that one is not flogged for its</b> violation; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Ya’akov says: This is not for</b> that <b>reason; rather,</b> it is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that it is a prohibition that does not involve an action, and for</b> a violation of <b>a prohibition that does not involve an action one is not flogged.</b>",
            "<b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>found this unattributed</b> mishna, which teaches (27b): If one states: On my <b>oath I will not eat this loaf,</b> and immediately states: On my <b>oath I will not eat it, and</b> then <b>he ate it,</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>he is liable</b> for <b>only one</b> violation. Since the second oath did not prohibit any act in addition to the first oath, he is not liable for violating it.

            "The Gemara infers from the formulation of the mishna: It <b>is</b> specifically <b>this</b> case of an oath on an utterance for <b>which one is liable</b> to receive <b>lashes for its intentional</b> violation. <b>But</b> if a person stated: On my oath <b>I will eat, and</b> then <b>he did not eat, he is not flogged.</b> Presumably this is because the violation does not involve any action. This mishna, then, can provide a basis for Rabbi Yoḥanan’s ruling.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Now, this</b> mishna (27b) <b>is unattributed and that</b> mishna (2a) <b>is unattributed. What did</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>see that he practiced in accordance with this unattributed</b> mishna? <b>Let him</b> instead <b>practice in accordance with that unattributed</b> mishna.",
            "The Gemara adds another question: <b>And according to your reasoning</b> that both <i>mishnayot</i> carry equal weight, then with regard to <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>himself,</b> when he redacted the Mishna, <b>how could he teach us as unattributed</b> both <b>this</b> opinion in the mishna <b>here and that</b> opinion in the mishna <b>there?</b> This would result in a contradiction.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> it is apparent that <b>initially</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>held</b> that <b>for</b> a violation of <b>a prohibition that does not involve an action one is flogged, and</b> so <b>he taught it</b> as <b>an unattributed</b> mishna, <b>and</b> later <b>he retracted</b> his opinion and <b>held</b> that <b>one is not flogged for</b> a violation of such a prohibition, <b>and</b> so <b>he taught</b> that opinion as <b>an unattributed</b> mishna. <b>And</b> he left the first mishna (2a) as it was because <b>a mishna does not move from its place,</b> i.e., since the students had already learned that mishna it was deemed inappropriate to remove it. Based on this logic, Rabbi Yoḥanan ruled in accordance with the later mishna (27b).",
            "The Gemara clarifies: <b>In accordance with which</b> opinion <b>did you interpret</b> the mishna? <b>In accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, and</b> it is referring to liability <b>to</b> receive <b>lashes.</b> The Gemara questions this: But in the parallel case of <b>shades of</b> leprous <b>marks, what</b> punishment of <b>lashes is there?</b> The Gemara answers: There is a punishment of lashes in a case <b>where one cuts off his snow-white</b> leprous <b>mark [<i>baheret</i>], and in accordance with</b> the principle that <b>Rabbi Avin says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ile’a</b> says, <b>as Rabbi Avin says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ile’a says: Wherever it is stated: Observe,</b> or: <b>Lest, or: Do not, it is nothing other than a prohibition.</b> So too, with regard to leprosy, the verse states: “Observe the leprous mark” (Deuteronomy 24:8), which according to Rabbi Ile’a’s principle teaches a prohibition, namely that it is prohibited to remove the mark. Accordingly, one who violates this prohibition is liable to receive lashes.",
            "The Gemara asks further: But in the parallel clause of acts of <b>carrying out</b> that are prohibited <b>on Shabbat, what</b> punishment of <b>lashes is there?</b> The prohibition against doing so <b>is a prohibition</b> in the Torah <b>that</b> potentially <b>serves as a mandate</b> for court-imposed <b>capital punishment, and</b> the generally accepted principle is that with regard to a violation of <b>any prohibition</b> in the Torah <b>that</b> potentially <b>serves as a mandate</b> for court-imposed <b>capital punishment, one is not flogged for its</b> violation even if no death penalty is imposed, as that prohibition is punishable only by death. The Gemara answers: <b>It is due to that</b> reason that <b>we interpreted</b> the mishna to be <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, as he says</b> that with regard to <b>a prohibition</b> in the Torah <b>that</b> potentially <b>serves as a mandate</b> for court-imposed <b>capital punishment, one is flogged for its</b> violation in a case where there is no actual death penalty.",
            "The Gemara asks: Is that to say that <b>were it not for this</b> reason, the mishna could be <b>interpreted in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> who holds that one is not flogged for violating such prohibitions? But then the question raised above with regard to the mishna’s detailing of the cases of one’s <b>awareness</b> of the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods poses <b>a difficulty,</b> as Rabbi Akiva holds that one is not liable if he entered the Temple during a lapse of awareness of the fact that the place he entered was actually the Temple, whereas the mishna indicates one is liable in such a case. The Gemara answers: <b>Didn’t you say</b> above that it is possible to conclude that the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael and</b> the liability referred to in the mishna is for liability <b>to</b> receive <b>lashes?</b> Similarly, it is <b>also</b> possible to say that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva and</b> the liability referred to in the mishna is for liability <b>to</b> receive <b>lashes.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> why did the <i>tanna</i> use the term: Cases of <b>awareness,</b> which is generally used for cases in which the transgression was performed during a lack of awareness and then subsequent awareness is necessary in order for the person to be liable to bring an offering? The <i>tanna</i> <b>should have</b> instead said: <b>Forewarnings,</b> as the forewarning is a necessary condition to be able to give lashes for an intentional transgression. The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult;</b> emend and <b>teach</b> the mishna as saying: Cases of <b>awareness of forewarnings.</b>",
            "The Gemara rejects the suggestion that the mishna is referring to liability to receive lashes: <b>If so,</b> if the mishna is referring to liability to receive lashes, why does it state that there are <b>two</b> types <b>that are four? There are</b> only <b>two</b> types. Since the person was forewarned he is certainly fully aware of all aspects of his transgression. Accordingly, there are only two cases of liability: For a ritually impure person who enters the Temple and for a ritually impure person who partakes of sacrificial foods. <b>And furthermore,</b> the continuation of the mishna states the case: <b>In which</b> one <b>had awareness at the beginning and awareness at the end, but</b> had <b>a lapse of awareness in between,</b> when he actually transgressed. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is <b>the relevance of lapses of awareness to</b> one’s liability to receive <b>lashes?

Clearly then, the mishna is not referring to liability to receive lashes.",
            "Having rejected the suggestion that the mishna is referring to liability to be punished with lashes, it addresses the difficulty raised above that the mishna’s ruling with regard to oaths does not accord with Rabbi Yishmael’s opinion and its ruling with regard to cases of one’s awareness of the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods does not accord with Rabbi Akiva’s opinion. If so, whose opinion is expressed in the mishna? <b>Rather, Rav Yosef said:</b> The mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and he formulates</b> the mishna <b>according to</b> different <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as follows: <b>With regard to</b> cases of one’s <b>awareness</b> of the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods, <b>he formulates it in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> and <b>with regard to oaths, he formulates it in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b>",

            "The Gemara explains the logical reasoning: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>Rabbi Akiva deems</b> one <b>liable</b> for oaths <b>pertaining to the past?</b> The reason is <b>that he expounds</b> verses using the method of <b>amplifications and restrictions</b> (see 26a). <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>also expounds</b> verses using the method of <b>amplifications and restrictions,</b> and consequently he arrives at the same opinion as Rabbi Akiva.",
            "The Gemara demonstrates its point: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says</b> that <b>one can redeem</b> a woman’s <b>firstborn son with any</b> item worth five shekels, <b>except for</b> promissory <b>notes.

            "The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? <b>He expounds</b> verses using the method of <b>amplifications and restrictions.</b> Accordingly, he expounds the verse: “And its redemption from one month shall you redeem, according to the valuation of five silver shekels by the sacred shekel” (Numbers 18:16), as follows: Concerning the phrase: <b>“And its redemption from one month,”</b> since it does not specify that only certain items can be used for the redemption, the verse <b>amplified</b> the category of items that can be used to redeem the firstborn, intimating that many different items can be used. Then, with the phrase: <b>“According to the valuation of five silver shekels,”</b> the verse <b>restricted</b> the category to items that are similar to silver shekels.

            "According to the hermeneutical principle that when a verse <b>amplified and</b> then <b>restricted and</b> then <b>amplified, it amplified</b> the relevant category to include <b>everything</b> except for the specific matter excluded in the restriction. The Gemara elaborates: <b>What</b> is included by the fact <b>it amplified?</b> Almost <b>everything. And what</b> is excluded by the fact <b>it restricted?

            "The Gemara explains the reasoning of the Rabbis: <b>And the Rabbis expound</b> verses through the method of <b>generalizations and details.</b> Accordingly, they expound the verse as follows: The phrase: <b>“And its redemption from one month,”</b> is <b>a generalization</b> which suggests that many different items can be used to redeem the firstborn. Then, the phrase: <b>“According to the valuation of five silver shekels,”</b> is <b>a detail,</b> which suggests that only items that are similar to silver shekels can be used. Then, with the term: <b>“Shall you redeem,”</b> the verse <b>again makes a generalization.</b>",
            "Based on this exegetical method, whenever a verse has <b>a generalization and</b> then <b>a detail and</b> then <b>a generalization,</b> the principle is that <b>you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail;</b> in this case, <b>just as the detail,</b> i.e., silver shekels, <b>is explicitly something that is movable and has intrinsic monetary</b> value, <b>so too, anything that is movable and has intrinsic monetary</b> value can be used.

            "This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah provides the process by which a Hebrew slave who has already completed his six years of servitude may continue on as a slave of his master: “And you shall take the <b>awl</b> and put it through his ear and in the door” (Deuteronomy 15:17).

            "It is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 73a): <b>One who carries out</b> an item <b>from</b> one <b>domain to</b> another <b>domain</b> is <b>liable.</b> The Gemara claims: <b>Are we not</b> also <b>dealing</b> with a case <b>where he is bringing</b> it <b>in</b> from a public domain to a private domain, <b>and</b> nevertheless the mishna <b>refers to it</b> as <b>carrying out?</b>",
            "The Gemara questions this assertion: <b>But perhaps</b> the mishna is dealing with a case of <b>carrying out</b> an item <b>from a private domain to a public domain.</b> The Gemara defends its claim: <b>If so, let it</b> instead <b>teach: One who carries out</b> an item <b>from a private domain to a public domain</b> is liable. <b>What</b> is the reason it used the more generalized formulation: <b>From</b> one <b>domain to</b> another <b>domain?</b> To teach <b>that</b> one is liable <b>even</b> if one transfers an item <b>from a public domain to a private domain.</b>",
            "The Gemara explains further: Even though the mishna addresses carrying an item in from a public domain to a private domain, <b>it refers to it as carrying out.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>The <i>tanna</i> refers to any</b> act that involves <b>removal of an item from its place as carrying out.</b> Accordingly, the term can appropriately be used even when an item is brought in to a private domain from a public domain.",

            "<b>Rava said:</b> One cannot make any inference from the language of the mishna, as it is not referring to acts of carrying out. Rather, <b>it teaches domains.</b> In other words, it means: With regard to the <b>domains of Shabbat</b> there are <b>two</b> types, the existence of which leads to four types of prohibited transfers, two with regard to carrying out and two with regard to bringing in.",
            "§ The mishna teaches: With regard to different <b>shades of</b> leprous <b>marks,</b> there are <b>two</b> types <b>that are</b> actually <b>four. We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Nega’im</i> 1:1): With regard to different <b>shades of</b> leprous <b>marks,</b> there are <b>two</b> types <b>that are</b> actually <b>four:</b> The <b><i>baheret</i>,</b> mentioned in the Torah (see Leviticus 13:2), is considered a primary mark; it is <b>an intense</b> white, <b>like snow.

Secondary to it</b> is a mark that is white <b>like the membrane of an egg.</b> The ordering of different shades is relevant in determining which shades can be combined together. In order for a leprous mark to be halakhically significant, it must at least be the size of a split Cilician bean [<i>geris</i>]. If a mark is that size, but it is composed of different shades of white, none of which is alone the size of a <i>geris</i>, then if the different shades are compatible they can combine together and will thereby render the person ritually impure.",
            "<b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> this mishna, which delineates the different <b>shades of leprous marks</b> into two groups?

But <b>if so, you have rendered pure</b> a mark that is white like the <b>lime</b> plaster <b>of the Sanctuary</b> walls and is smaller than a <i>geris</i>, as <b>it cannot be combined</b> with any other shade of white.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>With which</b> other shade <b>could we combine</b> the lime-colored mark? We cannot say: <b>Let us combine it together with</b> a snow-white <b><i>baheret</i>,</b> which is the primary mark relative to a lime-colored mark, as <b>there is</b> a wool-white <b><i>se’et</i>, which is a more</b> bright white <b>than</b> a lime-colored mark but less bright than snow white.

We cannot say: <b>Let us combine it together with a <i>se’et</i>,</b> as a lime-colored mark <b>is not its secondary</b> mark and a primary mark can combine only with its secondary mark. This is difficult because the mishna’s categorization of a lime-colored mark as a secondary mark indicates that it can be combined with another shade of white. Perforce, the mishna is not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> that Rabbi Akiva holds that only adjacent shades of white can combine together, why didn’t Rabbi Ḥanina <b>also</b> bring proof from a mark that is white like the <b>membrane of an egg,</b> as <b>with which</b> other shade <b>could we combine it?</b> We cannot say: <b>Let us combine it together with</b> a wool-white <b><i>se’et</i>,</b> which is the primary mark relative to an egg membrane–colored mark, as <b>there is a lime</b>-colored mark, <b>which is a more</b> bright white <b>than</b> an egg membrane–colored mark but less bright that wool white.

            "§ The Gemara elaborates on Rabbi Akiva’s opinion: <b>And where have we learned</b> that <b>according to Rabbi Akiva</b> the different shades should be ordered <b>this</b> one <b>above that</b> one, i.e., according to their degrees of brightness, and only two adjacent shades can combine together?",

            "The Gemara explains the difficulty: Rabbi Yehoshua suggested that according to Rabbi Akiva’s opinion it should be sufficient to say that any mark of a degree of brightness from that of an egg membrane and upward is impure, <b>but he did not say</b> that it would also be necessary to add: And any mark of a degree of brightness <b>from</b> that of the <b>lime</b> plaster <b>of the Sanctuary</b> walls <b>and above</b> is impure. If Rabbi Akiva agrees to the categorization of the mishna, then it would be necessary to state separately each category of marks, in a dual formulation, in order to indicate that only shades that are categorized together can combine.",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Conclude from</b> the fact <b>that he did not say</b> this <b>to</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>that</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>heard of Rabbi Akiva that he says: All</b> the different shades <b>combine with a <i>se’et</i>.</b> Accordingly, both a snow-white <i>baheret</i> and a lime-colored mark will each combine with a <i>se’et</i>, as they are adjacent to it when listed in order of their degrees of brightness. An egg membrane–colored mark will also combine with a <i>se’et</i>, as it is derived from the word: <i>Sappaḥat</i>, and the Torah indicates that a <i>sappaḥat</i> is secondary to a <i>se’et</i>.",
            "The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>But perhaps</b> Rabbi Akiva does hold that the only combinations possible are <b><i>a se’et</i> and its secondary</b> mark, i.e., an egg membrane–colored mark; and <b>a <i>baheret</i> and its secondary</b> mark, i.e., a lime-colored mark. And perhaps Rabbi Yehoshua in fact proposed that the Sages should use a dual formulation, but the <i>baraita</i> cites only the first half of his suggestion.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Akiva’s opinion can be inferred <b>from that</b> which <b>Rabbi Ḥanina</b> says, <b>as Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> The following is <b>an analogy</b> to illustrate the opinion <b>of Rabbi Akiva: To what is this matter comparable?</b> It is comparable <b>to four cups of milk,</b> and <b>two drops of blood fell into one</b> of them, <b>and four drops of blood fell into</b> another <b>one</b> of them, <b>and eight</b> drops of blood <b>fell into</b> another <b>one, and twelve drops</b> of blood <b>fell into</b> the last <b>one.

Rabbi Ḥanina’s analogy would appear to portray Rabbi Akiva’s opinion in the same way it was cited earlier.",
            "The Gemara rejects this. The Torah states that a “reddish-white affliction” (Leviticus 13:42), not just a flawless white one, renders a person ritually impure. Therefore, the Gemara suggests: <b>Say that you heard Rabbi Akiva</b> express this opinion <b>with regard to</b> combining different shades of a mark that is <b>mixed [<i>befatukh</i>]</b> with red, which is the case most similar to the analogy offered by Rabbi Ḥanina, but <b>with regard to</b> different shades of <b>flawless</b> white, <b>have you heard</b> Rabbi Akiva express this opinion?",

        ],
        [
            "<b>And if it is so</b> that Rabbi Akiva lists the different shades in decreasing order of their degree of brightness, then after mentioning the reddish variation of <i>baheret</i> <b>he should have</b> next said: The reddish variation <b>of a wool-</b>white mark <b>is darker than it,</b> not that the reddish variation of lime is darker than it.",
            "<b>They said</b> in response to this: <b>Yes, it is indeed so</b> that Rabbi Akiva continues by referring to the reddish variations of a wool-white mark, <b>and it is taught</b> likewise in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Natan says,</b> referring to that mishna: It is <b>not</b> correct <b>that Rabbi Akiva said:</b> The reddish variation <b>of lime is darker than it; rather,</b> he said that the reddish variation <b>of a</b> wool-white mark <b>is darker than it.</b>",
            "§ The Gemara considers the source from which the different shades of marks are derived: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that <i>baheret</i> is an intense</b> white color? <b>Abaye said: The verse states:</b> “And <b>if it is a white <i>baheret</i>”</b> (Leviticus 13:4), which indicates that <b>it</b> alone <b>is</b> a bright <b>white and there is no other</b> as <b>white</b> as it.",
            "<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The bright shade of <b>a <i>baheret</i></b> makes it appear <b>deeper</b> than the surrounding skin, <b>and so</b> the verse <b>states: “And its appearance is deeper than the skin”</b> (Leviticus 13:25). This is <b>like the appearance of</b> an area illuminated by the <b>sun, which</b> appears <b>deeper than</b> the area in <b>the shade.</b> The darker shade of <b>a <i>se’et</i></b> makes it appear as though it is raised above the surrounding skin; this is indicated by the fact that the word <b><i>se’et</i></b> means <b>nothing other than raised, and so</b> the verse <b>states: “Upon all the high mountains and upon all the raised up [<i>hanissaot</i>] hills”</b> (Isaiah 2:14). The words <i>hanissaot</i> and <i>se’et</i> share the same Hebrew root and both refer to something raised up. In the verse: “For a <i>se’et</i> and for a <i>sappaḥat</i>” (Leviticus 14:56), the word <b><i>sappaḥat</i></b> means <b>nothing other than secondary, and so</b> the verse <b>states: “And he will say: Append me [<i>sefaḥeni</i>] please</b> to one of the priestly classes to eat a piece of bread” (I Samuel 2:36).

            "<b>Rather,</b> a suitable analogy is where <b>the king of this</b> governor is <b>above his own governor, and the king of that</b> governor is <b>above his own governor.</b> So too, each secondary mark is subordinate only to its primary mark.",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>why do I</b> need the term <b>“through which”</b> (Leviticus 5:3)?

            "The Gemara answers: The term “through which” serves <b>to include</b> one who was rendered impure by eating the unslaughtered <b>carcass of a kosher bird.</b> Unlike other impure items, which render impure any person who touches them, the carcass of a kosher bird renders a person impure only if he eats it. Therefore, one might have thought he would not be liable for entering the Temple if he was rendered impure by having eating the carcass of a kosher bird.

            "The Gemara challenges: But <b>didn’t you say</b> above that the term <b>“through which” is a restriction?</b> How can you now use it to include additional cases? The Gemara explains: It is precisely <b>because it is a restriction</b> that <b>it includes</b> additional cases. As <b>it is written</b> at the beginning of that verse: <b>“Or if he will touch</b> an impurity of a man” (Leviticus 5:3), which indicates that one who is impure with a form of impurity <b>that can</b> impart impurity through <b>touching, yes,</b> he is liable for defiling the Temple by entering it in his impure state. But if one is impure with a form of impurity <b>that cannot</b> impart impurity through <b>touching,</b> then one would <b>not</b> be liable. Therefore, the verse opens with a restriction, and when the verse continues, <b>and it is written “through which,”</b> which is also <b>a restriction,</b> this <b>constitutes a restriction after a restriction, and a restriction after a restriction</b> serves <b>only to amplify</b> the <i>halakha</i>, applying it to additional cases.",
            "§ The mishna continues: For cases <b>in which</b> one <b>had awareness at the beginning,</b> but then transgressed during a lapse of awareness <b>and</b> still <b>had no awareness at the end,</b> the <b>goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary on Yom Kippur, and Yom Kippur itself, suspend any punishment that he deserves until he becomes aware of his transgression, at which point he must bring a sliding-scale offering. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the internal goat offering: <b>“And he shall effect atonement upon the Sanctuary from the impurities of the children of Israel</b> and from their acts of rebellion, for all their sins” (Leviticus 16:16).",

            "The Gemara clarifies the last part of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And what</b> possible refutation is the <i>baraita</i> referring to when it says: <b>If it is your wish to say</b> that this reasoning can be refuted? The Gemara explains: <b>And if you would say</b> of the preceding proof that it is incorrect to suggest that all priests achieve atonement from the bull of Aaron, as with regard to it the term: <b>“His household”</b> (Leviticus 16:6), <b>is written,</b> which suggests that it atones only for his immediate family, then this can be refuted, as <b>all of</b> the priests <b>are</b> collectively <b>referred to as his household,</b> as is evident from <b>that</b> which <b>is stated: “House of Aaron, bless the Lord;</b> house of Levi, bless the Lord, <b>those who fear the Lord, bless the Lord.”</b>",
            "The Gemara questions some of the expositions of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>this</b> phrase: “Goat <b>of the people”</b> (Leviticus 16:15), <b>does it come to</b> teach <b>that</b> which the <i>baraita</i> teaches, i.e., that the priests do not achieve atonement through it? But <b>that</b> phrase <b>is necessary</b> to teach <b>that the Merciful One states</b> that the goat <b>must be</b> purchased with funds collected <b>from</b> the <b>people.</b> The Gemara refutes this: <b>That</b> requirement <b>is derived from</b> the verse: <b>“And from the assembly of the children of Israel</b> he shall take two goats” (Leviticus 16:5).",
            "The Gemara asks further: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>this</b> phrase: <b>“His own</b> bull sin-offering” (Leviticus 16:6), <b>does it come to</b> teach <b>that</b> which the <i>baraita</i> teaches, i.e., that it atones only for Aaron’s transgressions, not for the transgressions of others? But <b>that</b> phrase <b>is necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The High Priest <b>brings,</b> i.e., purchases, the bull <b>from his own</b> funds, <b>but he does not bring it from</b> funds collected <b>from the public.</b>",
            "One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he does not bring it from</b> funds collected <b>from the public because the public does not achieve atonement through it, but he may bring</b> it <b>from</b> funds belonging to <b>his brethren the priests because his brethren the priests achieve atonement through it.</b> To counter this, <b>the verse states: “His own</b> bull sin-offering,” to indicate that he must purchase it using only his own funds.

            "If both mentions of the phrase “his own” are necessary to teach about the ownership of the bull, how can the above <i>baraita</i> suggest that the phrase indicates that the bull atones only for the High Priest’s transgressions? The Gemara explains: <b>This is what</b> is <b>difficult for the <i>tanna</i></b> of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is different about</b> the goat <b>of the people that</b> explains why <b>it does not atone</b> for the priests? The difference is <b>that</b> the priests <b>did not forfeit</b> any <b>money over</b> the purchase of <b>it.</b> Therefore, it does not atone for the priests, but only for the Israelites, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the internal goat: <b>“Of the people.” With regard to</b> the bull <b>of Aaron as well,</b> the priests <b>do not forfeit</b> any <b>money over</b> the purchase of <b>it,</b> so it follows that they should not achieve atonement through it. <b>And</b> therefore, to explain why they do achieve atonement, the <i>baraita</i> <b>states</b> that <b>all of</b> the priests <b>are</b> collectively <b>referred to as: His household.</b>",
            "§ The Gemara returns to its discussion of the dispute between Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to Rabbi Shimon,</b> who holds that the priests do not achieve atonement through the scapegoat, <b>that is</b> why <b>it is written</b> in the Torah that <b>two confessions</b> are to be recited over the bull <b>and</b> that the <b>blood of the bull</b> is to be presented inside the Sanctuary: Of these three forms of atonement, <b>one corresponds to</b> the atonement provided by the <b>goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary, <b>one corresponds to</b> the atonement provided by the <b>goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed outside</b> the Sanctuary, <b>and one corresponds to</b> the atonement provided by <b>the scapegoat.</b>",

            "The Gemara answers: Two confessions are necessary, <b>one for</b> the High Priest <b>himself, and one for his household,</b> i.e., the priests, <b>as the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> The High Priest must first confess his own transgressions and only afterward those of the priests, because <b>that is</b> how <b>the attribute of justice functions:</b> It is <b>better that the innocent come and atone for the guilty, than</b> that <b>the guilty come and atone for the guilty.</b> When the High Priest confesses the transgressions of those in his house, it is better that he already be considered innocent, having confessed and been absolved of his own transgressions.",

A communal bull sin-offering is brought because of the unwitting transgression of a prohibition involving an action by the Jewish people resulting from an erroneous halakhic decision handed down by the Sanhedrin.

The redundancy in the phrase “vows a vow” teaches that when one associates a vow with another prohibition, it does not take effect <b>unless he vows by</b> associating it with <b>an item</b> forbidden <b>by</b> means of <b>a vow.</b> Association is derived from this verse and is limited to vows.",

Why does the <i>baraita</i> need to mention the specific example of a vow concerning the day his father died? The Gemara answers: It <b>was necessary</b> that the <i>baraita</i> state that the vow takes effect for the sake of the other example: <b>Like</b> on <b>the day that Gedaliah ben Ahikam was killed.</b> Otherwise, it <b>may enter your mind to say: Since,</b> even <b>if he did not vow</b> to refrain from eating meat or drinking wine on that day <b>they would be prohibited to him anyway,</b> as it is a public fast day, <b>when he did vow</b> to refrain from eating and drinking on that day, the <b>prohibition</b> of the vow <b>would not take effect on him, and that</b> subsequent vow would then <b>not be associated with a vow,</b> but with an ordinary prohibition.

Therefore, the added sentence: This is an oath on an utterance, in the first clause, serves to exclude one who took an oath saying: I will eat, and who subsequently did not eat, from the liability to receive lashes; and the whole mishna can be understood as being in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva that one is liable to bring an offering even for oaths relating to the past.",
            "§ The mishna teaches that if one says: On my <b>oath I will not eat, and he</b> then <b>ate any amount,</b> even less than an olive-bulk, he is <b>liable</b> according to Rabbi Akiva. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>Does Rabbi Akiva in the entire Torah,</b> i.e., in general, <b>hold</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who deems</b> one <b>liable</b> for eating <b>any amount</b> of forbidden food? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> One who eats <b>any amount</b> of forbidden food is liable <b>to</b> receive <b>lashes, and</b> the Sages <b>stated</b> the measure of <b>an olive-bulk only in the matter of</b> determining liability to bring <b>an offering.</b>",
            "<b>And</b> if in fact Rabbi Akiva agrees with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, then <b>by right,</b> the mishna <b>should have</b> taught that Rabbi Akiva and the Rabbis <b>disagree in general. And</b> the reason <b>that</b> it states only <b>here</b> that <b>they disagree</b> is <b>to convey to you the far-reaching nature</b> of the opinion <b>of the Rabbis.</b> The Rabbis hold <b>that even though it is</b> possible <b>to say</b> that <b>since</b> one who eats less than an olive-bulk after taking an oath in which he <b>specifically</b> forbids himself any amount is <b>liable,</b> one who eats less than an olive-bulk <b>without</b> so <b>specifying</b> in his oath will <b>also</b> be <b>liable,</b> as that is included in his oath not to eat, that reasoning is not accepted. The mishna therefore states the dispute in the context of an oath that he will not eat in order to <b>teach us that,</b> according to the Rabbis, as long as he did not specify that his oath includes any amount, he is <b>exempt</b> from receiving lashes.",
            "The Gemara presents the other side of the dilemma: <b>Or perhaps, in general,</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>holds like the Rabbis</b> that one must consume at least an olive-bulk in order to be liable for a prohibition that involves eating. <b>And here,</b> with regard to an oath that one will not eat, <b>this is the reason</b> he disagrees: <b>Since</b> one who <b>specifically</b> forbids himself any amount is <b>liable,</b> one who eats less than an olive-bulk <b>without</b> so <b>specifying</b> in his oath will <b>also</b> be <b>liable.</b>",
            "<b>Come</b> and <b>hear that</b> which the Rabbis <b>said to Rabbi Akiva: Where do we find that</b> one who <b>eats any amount is liable,</b> leading you to say <b>that this</b> person is <b>liable?</b> The Gemara explains why this is relevant: <b>If it is so</b> that according to Rabbi Akiva one is always liable for eating any amount, <b>let him say to them: In the entire Torah I hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: The fact that Rabbi Akiva did not answer the Rabbis in that way does not necessarily indicate that he does not agree with Rabbi Shimon in general. Perhaps he <b>is speaking to the Rabbis in accordance with their</b> own <b>statement,</b> and this is how he would respond to their question: <b>As far as my opinion</b> is concerned, <b>in the entire Torah I hold</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> that one is liable for all prohibitions involving eating when one eats any amount. <b>According to you, admit to me at least</b> that <b>since</b> one who <b>specifically</b> forbids himself any amount is <b>liable,</b> one who eats less than an olive-bulk <b>without</b> so <b>specifying</b> in his oath will <b>also</b> be <b>liable. And the Rabbis said to him: No,</b> we will not admit that.",
            "The Gemara presents another attempt to resolve the dilemma. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a mishna (<i>Nazir</i> 34b): <b>Rabbi Akiva says: A nazirite who soaked his bread in wine</b> and ate it, <b>and</b> the two together <b>contain enough to combine to an olive-bulk,</b> is <b>liable,</b> even though there is less than the minimal measure of wine. <b>And if it should enter your mind that he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon in general,</b> then <b>why do I</b> need the wine and bread <b>to combine</b> to the measure of an olive-bulk? Consumption of any amount of wine should be sufficient for him to be liable.",
            "<b>And additionally, we learned</b> in a mishna (22b): If one says: On my <b>oath I will not eat, and</b> then <b>ate</b> the meat of unslaughtered <b>carcasses, or animals with a wound that will cause them to die within twelve months [<i>tereifot</i>],</b> or <b>repugnant creatures, or creeping animals,</b> he is <b>liable; and Rabbi Shimon deems</b> him <b>exempt. And we discussed it: Why</b> is he <b>liable</b> for breaking his oath when he eats non-kosher food? <b>He is</b> already <b>under oath from Mount Sinai</b> not to eat forbidden food, and an oath cannot take effect to render a matter forbidden that is already forbidden. <b>Rav and Shmuel and Rabbi Yoḥanan both,</b> i.e., all, <b>say</b> that this is a case <b>where he incorporates</b> into the oath that he will not eat some <b>permitted items, along with</b> the statement concerning the <b>forbidden items.</b> Since the oath takes effect with regard to the permitted items, it extends also to the forbidden ones.",
            "<b>And Reish Lakish says: You find</b> that one is liable for eating forbidden food as the result of an oath <b>only if</b> it is both an oath <b>where</b> he <b>specifies</b> that it includes <b>a half-measure,</b> in this case, less than an olive-bulk, <b>and in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis</b> that one is not liable for eating a half-measure unless it is specified in the oath. Since eating a half-measure is not prohibited by the Torah, the oath takes effect. Alternatively, you find that one is liable <b>if</b> he took the oath <b>without specifying</b> that the oath prohibits less than the usual measure <b>and in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Akiva, who says</b> that <b>a person renders himself prohibited from</b> eating <b>any amount</b> by taking an oath not to eat.",
            "<b>And if it enters your mind</b> that Rabbi Akiva <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon in general,</b> this is difficult, as one who consumes <b>any amount is also already under oath from Mount Sinai.</b> Why should the oath take effect according to Reish Lakish? <b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from it: In general, Rabbi Akiva holds like the Rabbis,</b> and it is only with regard to unspecified oaths that he deems one liable for eating any amount? The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from it</b> that Rabbi Akiva holds like the Rabbis.",
            "§ The mishna teaches: The Rabbis <b>said to Rabbi Akiva: Where do we find</b> that one who eats any amount is liable, leading you to say that this person is liable?

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t</b> one who eats less than an olive-bulk of <b>consecrated</b> food liable?

            "<b>What</b> is the specific instance in this context where one finds <b>that Rabbi Akiva interprets</b> with <b>amplifications and restrictions?</b> It is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that when the verse states: <b>“Or if anyone take an oath</b> clearly with his lips” (Leviticus 5:4), it <b>amplifies</b> the range of possible oaths for which one could be liable to bring an offering for an oath on an utterance. When the verse continues: <b>“To do evil, or to do good,”</b> it <b>restricts</b> that range. When it further continues: <b>“Whatsoever it be that a man shall utter clearly</b> with an oath,” it <b>then amplifies</b> again. According to the hermeneutical principle that when a verse <b>amplified, and</b> then <b>restricted, and</b> then <b>amplified, it amplified</b> the relevant category to include <b>everything</b> except for the specific matter that was excluded by the restriction.",
            "<b>What</b> was included when the verse <b>amplified</b> the range of liability? <b>It amplified</b> it to include <b>all matters</b> about which one might take an oath. <b>And</b> in <b>what</b> way did it <b>restrict</b> it when it continued: “To do evil, or to do good”? It <b>restricted</b> the range of liability for an oath on an utterance to exclude an oath that is <b>a matter</b> involving <b>a mitzva,</b> i.e., an oath to refrain from performing a mitzva.",
            "<b>And Rabbi Yishmael interprets</b> the verse following the hermeneutical principle of <b>a generalization and a detail: “Or if anyone take an oath clearly with his lips”</b> (Leviticus 5:4), is <b>a generalization; “to do evil, or to do good,”</b> is <b>a detail; “whatsoever it be that a man shall utter clearly</b> with an oath,” the verse <b>then</b> further <b>generalized.</b> There is a hermeneutical principle that when a verse contains <b>a generalization, and a detail, and</b> another <b>generalization, you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail. Just as the detail</b> in the verse is <b>explicitly</b> an oath referring <b>to the future, so too, all</b> the oaths for which one is liable must be referring <b>to the future.</b>",
            "<b>The generalization serves to include even</b> those <b>matters that do not concern doing evil or doing good</b> when they refer <b>to the future; the detail serves to exclude even matters that concern doing evil or doing good</b> when they refer <b>to the past.</b>",
            "The Gemara challenges: <b>I will reverse</b> it and say that the generalization serves to include oaths concerning the past, and the detail serves to exclude matters that do not involve doing evil or doing good. Why is that not an equally legitimate interpretation of the verse?",
            "<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said</b> that Rabbi Yishmael understands that liability is extended to one whose oath <b>is similar to an oath “to do evil, or to do good”</b> (Leviticus 5:4). <b>He whose prohibition is due to</b> the verse<b>: “He shall not break his word”</b> (Numbers 30:3), is liable, as liability for an oath about the future entails breaking one’s word. <b>Excluded is that</b> oath <b>whose prohibition is not due to</b> the verse<b>: “He shall not break his word”; rather,</b> it is <b>due to</b> the verse<b>: “You shall not lie”</b> (Leviticus 19:11), since liability for an oath about the past applies when the oath itself was a lie.",
            "<b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Avin says</b> that there is a different explanation of Rabbi Yishmael’s opinion: <b>The verse states: “Or if anyone take an oath clearly with his lips</b> to do evil, or to do good,” referring to <b>one whose oath precedes</b> its <b>clarification,</b> i.e., the action that breaks it, <b>and not</b> to one who takes an oath <b>where the clarification,</b> i.e., the action prohibited in the oath, <b>precedes the oath. Excluded is that</b> oath where one said, for example: <b>I ate, or: I did not eat, where the action precedes the oath.</b>",
            "§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “Or if anyone take an oath clearly with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatsoever it be that a man shall utter clearly with an oath, and it is hidden from him; and, when he knows of it, be guilty in one of these things” (Leviticus 5:4). The phrase <b>“a man…with an oath”</b> serves <b>to exclude a victim of circumstances beyond his control</b> from liability to bring an offering. The term <b>“and it is hidden”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> from liability one who broke his oath <b>intentionally,</b> as he does not deserve to be able to achieve atonement through bringing an offering.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: The term <b>“from him”</b> teaches that <b>one who was unaware of</b> his <b>oath,</b> i.e., forgot it, and subsequently broke it, is liable to bring an offering. One <b>might</b> have thought that an oath taker is also liable when he broke an oath <b>because he was unaware</b> that a particular item is forbidden as the <b>object</b> of his oath; therefore, <b>the verse states: “With an oath, and it is hidden from him.” He is liable for lack of awareness of the oath but he is not liable for lack of awareness of the object</b> of the oath.",

            "Rav Naḥman <b>said to him</b> in answer to his question: It is a case <b>where</b> the one taking the oath <b>says: I know that</b> taking <b>this oath is prohibited, but I do not know if one is liable</b> to bring <b>an offering for it or not.</b> Since he does not know the full implications of his action, it is regarded as unwitting, and he may still bring an offering to atone for it.",

Is it <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Munbaz, who says: Lack of intention with regard to the offering,</b> i.e., ignorance as to whether one’s action renders one liable to bring an offering, <b>is regarded as lack of intention?</b> There is a dispute between Munbaz and the Rabbis in tractate <i>Shabbat</i> (69a–b) with regard to one who knows that a particular action desecrates Shabbat but does not know that it renders one liable to bring a sin-offering. Munbaz holds that even one who is merely ignorant of the liability to bring an offering is deemed an unwitting sinner who brings a sin-offering to atone. The Rabbis disagree and deem him unwitting only if he is unaware that the action is prohibited.",
            "Rav Naḥman explains: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that this explanation accords with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.

            "Rav Naḥman continues: The reason for this principle is <b>that we derive</b> for which prohibitions one brings a sin-offering <b>from</b> the prohibition of <b>idol worship,</b> where one is liable to receive <i>karet</i> for an intentional violation and one is liable to bring a sin-offering for an unwitting violation. <b>And</b> yet <b>here,</b> in the case of the oath, <b>one brings</b> a sin-offering even though intentional violation of the prohibition is not punishable by <i>karet</i>. Given the novelty of the offering for an oath on an utterance, <b>even the Rabbis would agree</b> that ignorance of the fact that one is performing an action for which the Torah legislates an offering is sufficient for one to be regarded as unwitting and liable to bring a sliding-scale offering.",

            "Rava responded: If his life is <b>in danger, let the Master permit him</b> to eat, as saving his life overrides the prohibition; he is considered a victim of circumstances beyond his control and does not need to atone at all.

            "The Gemara explains how one derives that the oaths referred to in the verse are oaths about optional matters in accordance with Rabbi Yoshiya, who interprets the verse in accordance with the principle of amplifications and restrictions: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the verse about an oath on an utterance <b>is written with regard to optional matters,</b> the words “to do evil, or to do good” serve to <b>restrict</b> the meaning of the verse and exclude the application of an oath on an utterance to <b>a matter</b> involving <b>a mitzva.</b> The Gemara asks rhetorically: <b>But if you say</b> that the verse <b>is written</b> referring <b>to a matter</b> involving <b>a mitzva, what</b> do the words “to do evil, or to do good” serve to <b>restrict?</b>",

The Rabbis then asked him why he thinks one should be liable for an oath about a mitzva, since one would be exempt if it were inverted from positive to negative, rendering it an oath to refrain from performing a mitzva, which does not take effect. The Gemara comments: <b>The Rabbis’</b> objection <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira is well stated.</b>",

            "§ <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: One who denies a monetary</b> claim <b>to which there are witnesses</b> is <b>liable</b> to bring a guilt-offering for a false oath on a deposit.

Rav Pappa said: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yoḥanan?</b> It <b>occurs that witnesses die,</b> and it is therefore possible that he would not be found liable through their testimony; he is therefore considered to have denied a monetary claim.

            "<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said to Rav Pappa:</b> This cannot be the reasoning of Rabbi Yoḥanan, as it <b>also occurs that a promissory note becomes lost.

And the Rabbis say:</b> He is exempt from doing so, as <b>he</b> can <b>say to</b> the owner: <b>That which is yours is before you.</b> The robber may return the flooded field to its owner without reimbursing him for the loss in its value, since according to the Rabbis, land cannot be stolen. Consequently, the field is considered to be in the possession of its owner, and the thief is not obligated in the mitzva of returning a stolen item.",
            "Rabbi Yirmeya continues: <b>And we say: With regard to what do they disagree? Rabbi Eliezer interprets</b> the verses that discuss an oath on a deposit and the mitzva to return stolen items according to the hermeneutical principle of <b>amplifications and restrictions, and the Rabbis interpret</b> them according to the hermeneutical principle of <b>generalizations and details.</b>",
            "He explains: <b>Rabbi Eliezer interprets</b> the verses: “If anyone sin, and commit a trespass against the Lord, and deal falsely with his neighbor in a matter of deposit or of pledge, or of robbery, or have oppressed his neighbor…or of anything about which he has sworn falsely, he shall restore it in full” (Leviticus 5:21–24), according to the hermeneutical principle of <b>amplifications and restrictions.</b> The phrase “if anyone sin, and commit a trespass against the Lord, <b>and deal falsely with his neighbor” amplified</b> the <i>halakha</i>. When the verse states: <b>“In a matter of deposit or of pledge,”</b> it has <b>restricted</b> the <i>halakha</i> to the case of a deposit. When the verse then states: <b>“Or of anything about which he has sworn falsely,</b> he shall restore it in full,” <b>it</b> has <b>then amplified</b> the <i>halakha</i> again.",
            "Accordingly, as the Torah <b>amplified and</b> then <b>restricted and</b> then <b>amplified</b> again, it has <b>amplified</b> the <i>halakha</i> to include <b>everything</b> except for the specific matter excluded by the restriction. <b>What</b> is included due to the fact that the verse <b>has amplified</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The verse <b>has amplified</b> the <i>halakha</i> to include <b>everything</b> that one steals. <b>And what</b> is excluded due to the fact that the verse <b>restricted</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>It restricted</b> the <i>halakha</i> to exclude financial <b>documents,</b> which are dissimilar to a deposit in that their value is not intrinsic but rather due to their function. Consequently, according to Rabbi Eliezer, land that was stolen is included in the <i>halakhot</i> stated in these verses, and one who steals land must reimburse the field’s owner.",
            "<b>And the Rabbis interpreted</b> these verses according to the hermeneutical principle of <b>generalizations and details.</b> The phrase <b>“and deal falsely with his neighbor”</b> is <b>a generalization,</b> while the subsequent phrase, <b>“in a matter of deposit or of pledge, or of robbery,”</b> is <b>a detail.</b> When the verse then states: <b>“Or of anything about which he has sworn</b> falsely, he shall restore it in full,” <b>it</b> has <b>then generalized</b> again.

            "Accordingly, <b>just as the detail,</b> i.e., a deposit, <b>is explicitly</b> a case of <b>movable property and</b> has <b>intrinsic monetary</b> value, <b>so too,</b> the verse includes <b>anything that is movable property and</b> has <b>intrinsic monetary</b> value.

The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Shmuel</b> derive both <i>halakhot</i> from the verse, namely, that admission to part of a claim is necessary for an oath to be administered, and that the denial can be less than the value of two <i>ma’a</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>It is written: “This is,” and it is written: “It.”</b> The repetition of these similar terms is homiletically interpreted to indicate <b>that if</b> the defendant <b>denied part</b> of the two-<i>ma’a</i> claim <b>and admitted to</b> the other <b>part,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to take an oath.",
            "<b>And Rav</b> would respond that the repetition should be interpreted differently: <b>One</b> of the two terms is stated <b>to</b> indicate <b>admission of a part of the claim, and</b> the other <b>one</b> is stated <b>to</b> indicate <b>admission of the</b> same <b>type of</b> item as <b>the claim. And Shmuel</b> would respond: Even if you do not accept the derivation from the repetitious words, <b>don’t you derive from this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>by itself that</b> the denial may be less than two <i>ma’a</i>, since the admission <b>reduces</b> the value of <b>the claim?</b> If the claim was for two <i>ma’a</i>, as derived from the verse, and the defendant admitted to a part of the claim, then the value of denial was clearly less than two <i>ma’a</i>.",
            "<b>Rather, Rav</b> could have <b>said to you</b> that <b>when</b> the word <b>“silver” came initially, it came</b> as a source <b>for</b> the value of the <b>denial,</b> not the claim; <b>as if</b> this were not <b>so,</b> if it were meant to refer to the value of the claim, <b>let the Merciful One write</b> in the verse: <b>If a man delivers to his neighbor vessels to safeguard,</b> without mentioning silver, <b>and I</b> would <b>say</b> that <b>just as vessels are</b> at least <b>two, so too,</b> the claim must be for at least <b>two</b> of <b>any</b> item, including coins of silver.

By contrast, one who denies a claim <b>with regard to a deposit</b> and is proven to be lying <b>is disqualified from bearing witness.</b> The distinction is clearly based on the aforementioned reasoning: A debtor who denies the debt may be avoiding payment until he has enough money, whereas a bailee who denies having been given a deposit clearly intends to steal the item.",

In a case where the defendant suggests that instead of taking an oath himself, the claimant should take an oath and collect that which he claims, if the oath is administered <b>by Torah law, we do not transfer</b> the <b>oath</b> to the claimant; the defendant must either take an oath himself or pay.

            "<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 59b): <b>A lost item found</b> by <b>a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor</b> is not acquired by him, since he lacks the legal competence to effect acquisition. Nevertheless, taking such an item from him <b>is considered robbery on account of the ways of peace.</b> Although these individuals lack halakhic competence and are unable to acquire lost items by Torah law, taking such items from them is considered robbery. <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> This is <b>full-fledged robbery.

Accordingly, <b>what is the</b> practical <b>difference</b> between the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Yosei’s opinion there? The difference is that according to Rabbi Yosei, if one refuses to return the stolen item, <b>it is appropriated by the judges</b> and returned to the one who found it. The Gemara completes its question: Since according to the opinion of Rabbi Yosei the court enters one’s property to appropriate even an item that is owed by rabbinic law, <b>what</b> difference <b>is there between</b> an oath administered <b>by Torah</b> law <b>and</b> an oath administered <b>by rabbinic</b> law?",

The lender’s children cannot take the oath that their father would have taken, that the promissory note has not been paid. The only oath they can take is that their father never told them that it had been paid, and that is insufficient once the father became liable to take an oath.

One of the conditions necessary in order for one to incur liability for an oath on an utterance is that the oath can be formulated as both a negative and a positive statement.

This <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rav.<br/>This chapter explained that a bailee who makes a false claim and takes an oath to that effect is not always liable for falsely taking an oath of the bailees. The principle with regard to this matter was stated at the end of the mishna: Any bailee who makes a false claim that would in any case not render him exempt from liability to pay, and takes an oath to that effect, is not liable for falsely taking an oath of the bailees."
