            "If the court issued a ruling to violate one of the commandments mentioned in the Torah, and an individual went and accidentally did it on their instructions, whether they did it and he did it with them, whether they did it and he did it after them, whether they did not do it and he did it, he is exempt because he relied on the court.", 
            "If the court issued [such] a ruling and one of them knew that they erred, or a student who is capable of ruling [knew that they erred], and he went and did it because of their instructions, whether they did it and he did it with them, whether they did it and he did it after them, whether they did not do it and he did it, he is liable because he was not relying on the court. This is the rule: If one relies on himself, he is liable. If one relies on the court, he is exempt.",

            " Like what happened with R. Gamaliel and R. Joshua. They were traveling on a ship. R. Gamaliel had some bread and R. Joshua had with him bread and flour. When R. Gamaliel's bread was finished he depended on R. Joshua's flour. He said to him: Did you know, that we would be so delayed that you brought flour ? He said to him: Every 70 years a star appears that confuses the (ships) [sailors], so I said to myself: perhaps this star will appear and confuse us. He said to him: So much is in your control, yet you board a ship.  Instead of marveling at me, marvel about the two disciples you have on land, R. Eleazar Hisma and R. Yohanan b. Gudgada,  who are able to calculate how many drops are in the sea, and yet don't have bread to eat or clothes to put on. He decided to appoint them to leadership positions.  When he got back to land he sent for them, but they didn't come. He sent for them again and they came. He said to them: \"Do you imagine that I was offering you rulership? "
