            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>a court</b> erroneously <b>issued a ruling</b> permitting the Jewish people <b>to violate one of all the mitzvot that are stated in the Torah, and an individual proceeded and performed</b> that transgression <b>unwittingly on the basis of</b> the court’s ruling, then <b>whether</b> the judges <b>performed</b> the transgression <b>and he performed</b> it <b>with them,</b> or <b>whether</b> the judges <b>performed</b> the transgression <b>and he performed</b> it <b>after them,</b> or <b>whether</b> the judges <b>did not perform</b> the transgression <b>and he performed</b> it alone, in all these cases the individual is <b>exempt</b> from bringing an offering. This is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that he associated</b> his action <b>with</b> the ruling of the <b>court.</b>",
            "If the <b>court issued a ruling and one of</b> the judges <b>knew that they erred,</b> despite the fact that the majority ruled against his opinion, <b>or</b> if he was <b>a student and he</b> was <b>qualified to issue</b> halakhic <b>rulings, and</b> that judge or student <b>proceeded and performed</b> that transgression <b>on the basis of its</b> ruling, then <b>whether</b> the judges <b>performed</b> the transgression <b>and he performed</b> it <b>with them,</b> or <b>whether</b> the judges <b>performed</b> the transgression <b>and he performed</b> it <b>after them,</b> or <b>whether</b> the judges <b>did not perform</b> the transgression <b>and he performed</b> it alone, in all these cases, the judge or the student <b>is liable</b> to bring an offering.

This is the principle: One who associates</b> his action <b>with himself</b> is <b>liable, and one who associates</b> his action <b>with</b> the ruling of the <b>court</b> is <b>exempt.</b>",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Shmuel says:</b> The judges of the <b>court are never liable</b> to bring an offering for an erroneous ruling <b>until they say to</b> those seeking a ruling: <b>It is permitted for you. Rav Dimi from Neharde’a says:</b> The judges are not liable <b>unless they say to</b> those seeking a ruling: <b>It is permitted for you to perform</b> this action. <b>What is the reason</b> that Rav Dimi says that there is liability only if the judges say: To perform this action? It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that the ruling is not completed</b> if they say only: It is permitted, as perhaps the judges were expressing a theoretical opinion and not issuing a ruling.",
            "<b>Abaye said: We learn</b> proof for Rav Dimi’s opinion in a mishna <b>as well.</b> The mishna teaches with regard to a rebellious elder (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 86b): If the Sanhedrin ruled contrary to the ruling of the elder and the elder then <b>returned to his city,</b> and nevertheless <b>he taught in the manner that he was teaching</b> previously, he is <b>exempt</b> from punishment. But if he <b>instructed</b> others <b>to act</b> on the basis of his ruling that stands contrary to the ruling of the Sanhedrin, he is <b>liable</b> to be executed.",
            "<b>Rabbi Abba said: We learn</b> proof for Rav Dimi’s opinion in a mishna <b>as well.</b> The mishna teaches (<i>Yevamot</i> 87b): If the <b>court instructed</b> a woman <b>to marry</b> on the basis of inaccurate testimony, <b>but she proceeded and disgraced</b> herself and engaged in promiscuous intercourse, she is <b>liable to</b> bring <b>an offering, as they permitted her only to marry,</b> and her conduct lacked the approval of the court. This indicates that it is not sufficient for the court to issue a general ruling to the woman; rather, the court issues a ruling that includes instruction to perform a specific action.",
            "<b>Ravina said: We learn</b> proof for Rav Dimi’s opinion in the mishna here, <b>as well:</b> If <b>a court</b> unwittingly <b>issued a ruling</b> permitting the Jewish people <b>to violate one of all the mitzvot that are stated in the Torah,</b> etc.; and <b>nothing more</b> need be said, as it is clear from the phrase: Issued a ruling to violate, that the ruling must include instruction to perform a specific action.",
            "<b>Some say</b> there is a version of this amoraic dispute with the opposite opinions. <b>Shmuel says:</b> The judges of the <b>court are not liable</b> to bring an offering for an erroneous ruling <b>until they say to</b> those seeking a ruling: <b>It is permitted for you to perform</b> this action. <b>Rav Dimi from Neharde’a says: Even</b> if the judges say to those seeking a ruling: <b>It is permitted for you,</b> the <b>ruling is completed</b> and they are liable. <b>Abaye said: But isn’t</b> it so that <b>we did not learn</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rav Dimi in a mishna with regard to a rebellious elder: If the Sanhedrin ruled contrary to the ruling of the elder and the elder then <b>returned to his city, and</b> nevertheless <b>he taught in the manner that he was teaching</b> previously, he is <b>exempt</b> from punishment. But if he <b>instructed</b> others <b>to act</b> on the basis of his ruling that stands contrary to the ruling of the Sanhedrin, he is <b>liable</b> to be executed.",
            "<b>Rabbi Abba said: But isn’t</b> it so that <b>we did not learn</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rav Dimi in a mishna: If the <b>court instructed</b> a woman <b>to marry</b> on the basis of inaccurate testimony, <b>but she proceeded and disgraced</b> herself and engaged in promiscuous intercourse, she is <b>liable to</b> bring <b>an offering, as they permitted her only to marry,</b> and her conduct lacked the approval of the court.",

            "§ The mishna teaches: <b>And the individual proceeded and performed</b> that transgression <b>unwittingly on the basis of</b> the court’s ruling. The Gemara asks: <b>And let us teach</b> only: <b>And performed</b> that transgression <b>on the basis of</b> the court’s ruling; <b>why do I</b> need to add: <b>Unwittingly?</b> Obviously, it was unwitting, as he thought his action was permitted. <b>Rava said:</b> The term <b>unwittingly</b> serves <b>to include</b> a case where <b>the court issued a ruling that</b> it is <b>permitted</b> to eat forbidden <b>fat, and</b> the forbidden <b>fat became confused for him with</b> permitted <b>fat, and he ate it</b> under the impression that he was eating permitted fat. In this case he is <b>exempt.</b> Then, when the mishna says: <b>On the basis of</b> the court’s ruling, it means that he ate forbidden fat <b>actually on the basis of</b> the court’s ruling.",
            "<b>And some say</b> that <b>Rava said</b> a different interpretation of the mishna: <b>It is</b> specifically in a case where the individual proceeded and performed that transgression <b>unwittingly on the basis of</b> the court’s ruling <b>that</b> he is <b>exempt. But</b> if the forbidden <b>fat became confused for him with</b> permitted <b>fat and he ate it</b> under the impression that he was eating permitted fat, he is <b>liable</b> to bring an offering, because his unwitting transgression of eating forbidden fat was not associated solely with the ruling of the court.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>The matter that</b> is <b>obvious to Rava,</b> that one who confuses between forbidden fat and permitted fat is either exempt, according to the first version, or liable, according to the second version, <b>was raised as a dilemma for Rami bar Ḥama, as Rami bar Ḥama raised a dilemma:</b> If <b>a court ruled that</b> forbidden <b>fat is permitted, and</b> the forbidden fat <b>became confused for him with</b> permitted <b>fat and he ate</b> the forbidden fat, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?",
            "<b>Rava said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from the mishna: The <b>individual proceeded and performed</b> that transgression <b>unwittingly on the basis of</b> the court’s ruling, <b>etc. Why do I</b> need the redundancy: <b>Unwittingly on the basis of</b> the court’s ruling? Is the redundancy <b>not</b> stated <b>to include</b> a case where the <b>court issued a ruling that</b> it is <b>permitted</b> to eat forbidden <b>fat, and</b> the forbidden <b>fat became confused for him with</b> permitted <b>fat, and he ate it</b> under the impression that he was eating permitted fat, and the mishna is teaching that he is <b>exempt?</b> The Gemara rejects this: <b>Perhaps</b> the intent of the mishna is: <b>It is</b> in a case where one performed that transgression <b>unwittingly on the basis of its</b> ruling <b>that</b> he is <b>exempt; but</b> if the forbidden <b>fat became confused for him with</b> permitted <b>fat, and he ate</b> it under the impression that he was eating permitted fat, he is <b>liable.</b>",
            "<b>Some say</b> that <b>Rava said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the mishna: The <b>individual proceeded and performed</b> that transgression <b>unwittingly on the basis of</b> the court’s ruling. <b>What, is it not</b> in a case where one performed that transgression <b>unwittingly on the basis of its</b> ruling <b>that</b> he is <b>exempt; but</b> if the forbidden <b>fat became confused for him with</b> permitted <b>fat, and he ate</b> the forbidden fat, he is <b>liable?</b> The Gemara rejects this: <b>Perhaps</b> the mishna is saying that he is liable if he <b>either</b> confused forbidden fat with permitted fat and ate the forbidden fat <b>unwittingly, or</b> ate the forbidden fat <b>on the basis of</b> the court’s ruling.",
            "The Gemara notes: This matter was already taught <b>in the dispute</b> between <i>amora’im</i> of earlier generations: If <b>a court ruled that</b> forbidden <b>fat is permitted, and</b> the forbidden <b>fat became confused for him with</b> permitted <b>fat and he ate</b> the forbidden fat, <b>Rav says:</b> He is <b>exempt,</b> as the court ruled that it is permitted, <b>and Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> He is <b>liable,</b> as he did not base his conduct on its ruling. The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan from a <i>baraita</i> that teaches: The verse states: “And if one soul <b>from among the common people</b> shall sin unwittingly <b>in performing</b> one of the mitzvot of the Lord that are not to be done, and he is guilty” (Leviticus 4:27). This serves <b>to exclude an apostate.</b> When an apostate sins unwittingly, he is exempt from liability to bring a sin-offering even if he repents, as even his unwitting action is considered intentional.",
            "<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yosei says in the name of Rabbi Shimon: It is unnecessary</b> to derive this <i>halakha</i> from that phrase, <b>as it says</b> in the same verse: “Shall sin <b>unwittingly</b> in performing one of the mitzvot of the Lord <b>that are not to be done, and he is guilty; or</b> if his sin, which he has sinned, <b>be known</b> to him” (Leviticus 4:27–28). From the words “be known to him” it is inferred that only <b>one who repents due to his awareness,</b> i.e., he would not have sinned if he had known the act was prohibited, <b>brings a sacrifice for his unwitting</b> transgression in order to achieve atonement. But one who does <b>not repent due to his awareness</b> that he sinned, e.g., an apostate, who would have sinned even had he been aware that the act is prohibited, <b>does not bring an offering for his unwitting</b> action.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And if it is so</b> that one who would not repent due to his awareness is exempt, <b>isn’t</b> this person who confused forbidden fat with permitted fat considered one who will <b>not repent due to his awareness?</b> Even if he discovers that he ate forbidden fat he will not regret his action, as he relies on the ruling of the court that forbidden fat is permitted. This contradicts the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan, who says that one is liable in that case.",
            "<b>Rav Pappa said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan holds: Since once it becomes known to the court</b> that it erred, the judges will <b>retract their</b> erroneous ruling, <b>and</b> this individual will <b>also repent</b> when he discovers that he ate forbidden fat which the court erroneously permitted, <b>we characterize him</b> as <b>one who repents due to his awareness, and he is liable</b> to bring an offering.",
            "<b>Rava says:</b> Even though Rav says the individual is exempt, and his sin is dependent on the court, <b>Rav concedes that</b> in a case where one confused forbidden fats with permitted fats, <b>he does not complete a majority of the congregation.</b> The court is liable to bring an offering only when the majority of the congregation performs a transgression based on its ruling. This individual who thought the fat was permitted is not included in the majority of the congregation. <b>What is the reason?</b> It is as <b>the verse states:</b> “For all the people it was performed <b>unwittingly”</b> (Numbers 15:26), from which it is derived: There is no liability <b>unless they are all unwitting</b> in <b>one</b> and the same manner; and the action of this individual is unwitting in a different manner than the rest of the transgressors.",
            "§ The mishna teaches: <b>Whether</b> the judges <b>performed</b> the transgression <b>and he performed</b> it <b>with them,</b> or whether the judges performed the transgression and he performed it after them, or whether the judges did not perform the transgression and he performed it alone, in all these cases the individual is exempt. The Gemara asks: <b>Why did</b> the <i>tanna</i> in the mishna need to <b>teach all</b> of <b>these</b> cases? <b>Granted,</b> in <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> the mishna employing the style: <b>Not</b> only <b>this</b> but <b>also that,</b> i.e., not only is he exempt if the judges performed the transgression with him, but he is exempt even if he performed the act after the judges, and even if he alone performed the transgression. <b>But</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna, <b>where</b> the <i>tanna</i> is teaching <b>liability,</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>should have</b> taught <b>the opposite.</b> He should have started with the case where he is most likely to be liable, the case where the judges performed no transgression and he sinned alone."
        ],
        [
            "The Gemara answers: In the latter clause, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> the mishna employing the style: <b>This, and it is unnecessary to say that,</b> i.e., the cases are arranged with each case more obvious than the one that preceded it.",
            "§ The mishna teaches: <b>And one of</b> the judges <b>knew that they erred, or</b> if he was <b>a student and</b> he is <b>qualified to issue</b> halakhic <b>rulings.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>two</b> cases? As a student qualified to issue halakhic rulings is the equivalent of one of the judges, why did the <i>tanna</i> mention both? <b>Rava said: It was necessary</b> to state both, as it may <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>this statement</b> that he is liable applies specifically to one who is <b>learned and analytical, but</b> that one who is <b>learned but not analytical, no,</b> he should not be liable to bring an offering. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> cites both the case of a judge and the case of a student qualified to issue halakhic rulings, to teach that even one who is learned but not analytical is liable in this case.",
            "<b>Abaye</b> challenged this and <b>said to</b> Rava that the term: A student qualified <b>to issue</b> halakhic <b>rulings, indicates</b> that he is both <b>learned and analytical.</b> Rava <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>This</b> is what <b>I am saying: If</b> the <i>tanna</i> had taught the <i>halakha</i> <b>from that</b> first <i>halakha</i> with regard to one of the judges, <b>I would say</b> that <b>this statement</b> applies only to one who is both <b>learned and analytical, but</b> if he was <b>learned and not analytical, no,</b> he would not be liable. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> the additional case of a student <b>qualified to issue</b> halakhic <b>rulings,</b> and <b>from</b> the <b>extraneous</b> case in the <b>mishna</b> one can infer that the <i>halakha</i> applies <b>even</b> to one who is <b>learned but not analytical</b> or one who is <b>analytical but not</b> yet <b>learned.</b> Since he associates his action with himself, he is liable.",
            "§ The mishna teaches: <b>Qualified to issue</b> halakhic <b>rulings.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Like whom?</b> Who is an example of one qualified to issue halakhic rulings? <b>Rava said:</b> It is one <b>like Shimon ben Azzai or Shimon ben Zoma,</b> who, although they were among the most outstanding Torah scholars of their generation, were not ordained. <b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: In <b>a case like this, he is an intentional</b> sinner, as a scholar of that caliber would certainly not err. If he ruled that a prohibited action is permitted, it is assumed that he acted with intent, and he is exempt from bringing an offering.",
            "Rava said to Abaye: <b>But according to your reasoning, that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that cites the verse: <b>“In performing one”</b> (Leviticus 4:27), from which it is derived that <b>an individual who performs</b> a transgression <b>on his own is liable,</b> while one who performs a transgression based <b>on the ruling of</b> the <b>court is exempt; how</b> so? When does this apply? If the <b>court ruled that</b> forbidden <b>fat is permitted, and it became known to one of</b> the judges <b>that they erred, or</b> if he was <b>a student</b> who was <b>sitting before them and he is qualified to issue</b> halakhic <b>rulings, e.g., Shimon ben Azzai, might</b> one have thought that <b>he would be exempt?</b> To counter this, <b>the verse states: “In performing one,”</b> from which it is derived that <b>an individual who performs</b> a transgression <b>on his own is liable,</b> while one who performs a transgression <b>on</b> the basis of <b>the ruling of</b> the <b>court is exempt.</b>",
            "Rava continues: <b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is difficult; <b>how can you find these</b> circumstances where a judge or a prominent Torah scholar would be considered an unwitting sinner? The Gemara answers: It is in a case <b>where</b> the judge or the scholar <b>knew that</b> the action with regard to which the court issued a ruling that it is permitted is in fact <b>prohibited, but he erred with regard to the mitzva of heeding the statements of the Sages.</b> He believed that there is a mitzva to heed the directives of the Sages even when he is certain that they are mistaken. If so, <b>according to my</b> understanding <b>too,</b> the reference is to one like Shimon ben Azzai or Shimon ben Zoma; it is also a case <b>where they erred with regard to the mitzva of heeding the statements of the Sages.</b> Due to that error, they are liable to bring an offering.",
            "§ The mishna teaches: <b>This is the principle: One who associates</b> his action <b>with himself is liable.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> case that was not already mentioned in the mishna does this principle serve <b>to include?</b> The Gemara answers: It serves <b>to include</b> one who <b>disdains</b> halakhic <b>rulings</b> in general, treating them with contempt and relying only on his own understanding.",
            "The mishna teaches the second part of that principle: And <b>one who associates</b> his action <b>with</b> the ruling of the <b>court</b> is exempt. The Gemara explains: This principle serves <b>to include</b> an additional case that was not yet mentioned in the mishna, namely, where the <b>court issued a ruling and</b> the judges <b>discovered that they erred and reversed their</b> decision. If one was unaware that the court reversed their decision, and acted based on their initial ruling, he is deemed one who associates his action with the ruling of the court and is exempt. The Gemara challenges: The <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>explicitly</b> in the next mishna (3a), and consequently there is no need for an allusion in this mishna. The Gemara explains: The <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches it</b> ambiguously, <b>and then teaches it explicitly.</b>",
            "§ <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: This</b> <i>halakha</i> in the mishna, which states that an individual who performs a transgression on the basis of a ruling issued by the court is exempt from liability to bring an offering, is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. But the Rabbis say: An individual who performs</b> a transgression <b>on</b> the basis of <b>the ruling of</b> the <b>court</b> is <b>liable.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> to which Shmuel refers? It is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And <b>if one soul</b> from among the common people <b>shall sin unwittingly in performing</b> one of the mitzvot of the Lord” (Leviticus 4:27). <b>These are three exclusionary</b> terms: “One,” “unwittingly,” and “in performing,” and one of these exclusions serves to teach that <b>one who performs</b> a transgression <b>on his own</b> is <b>liable,</b> while one who performs a transgression <b>on</b> the basis of <b>the ruling of</b> the <b>court</b> is <b>exempt.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the opinion of <b>the Rabbis?</b> It is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Still I say:</b> Each member of <b>a minority of the congregation that sinned</b> based on the ruling of a court is <b>liable</b> to bring an offering for his unwitting transgression, <b>as</b> the <b>court does not bring a bull</b> for an unwitting communal sin <b>on the basis of</b> the minority’s transgression. One might have thought that each member of <b>a majority of</b> the <b>congregation that sinned</b> based on the ruling of a court <b>would be exempt</b> from liability to bring an offering for his unwitting transgression, <b>as</b> the <b>court brings a bull</b> for an unwitting communal sin <b>on the basis of</b> the majority’s transgression. To counter this, <b>the verse states</b> with regard to a sin-offering brought for an unwitting transgression: <b>“From among the common people,”</b> from which it is derived that <b>even</b> members of <b>the majority of</b> the congregation, <b>and even</b> members of <b>the entire</b> congregation, are not exempt because of the ruling of the court.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>In what</b> circumstances did the majority of the congregation sin? <b>If we say</b> that the reference is to a transgression <b>with unwitting</b> performance of <b>an action</b> unrelated to a ruling of the court, why does the <i>tanna</i> say: As the court brings a bull for an unwitting communal sin on the basis of the majority’s transgression? Given that this is a case where <b>a court</b> did <b>not</b> issue <b>a ruling, what action did</b> the <b>court</b> perform? Since it was <b>not on</b> the basis of <b>the ruling of</b> the <b>court, does</b> the <b>court bring</b> a bull for an unwitting communal sin that was performed <b>not on</b> the basis of its <b>ruling? Rather,</b> the reference in the <i>baraita</i> must be to a case where the majority of the congregation performed a transgression <b>on</b> the basis of the <b>ruling</b> of the court. If so, the question arises: <b>But when it is written</b> with regard to a sin-offering brought for an unwitting transgression: <b>“From among the common people,”</b> it is <b>with regard to</b> a transgression <b>with unwitting</b> performance <b>of an action that it is written.</b>",
            "<b>Rather, is it not</b> that <b>this</b> is what the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is incomplete and must be taught in this manner: Each member of <b>a minority of the congregation that sinned with unwitting</b> performance <b>of an action</b> is <b>liable</b> to bring an offering for his unwitting transgression, <b>as</b> the <b>court does not bring a bull</b> for an unwitting communal sin <b>on the basis of</b> the minority’s transgression <b>in</b> a case where the court issued an erroneous <b>ruling. But</b> a minority of the congregation that sinned unwittingly on the basis of the ruling of the court is also <b>liable.</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>a majority of the congregation that</b> sinned <b>with unwitting</b> performance <b>of an action would be exempt, as</b> the <b>court brings a bull</b> for an unwitting communal sin <b>on the basis of</b> the majority’s transgression <b>in</b> a case where the court issued an erroneous <b>ruling.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “From among the common people,”</b> from which it is derived that <b>even</b> members of <b>the majority of</b> the congregation are liable. If the unwitting transgression was performed not on the basis of the ruling of the court, there is no difference between a minority and a majority of the people. This is proof that according to the Rabbis both an individual and a minority of the congregation who performed a transgression on the basis of the ruling of the court are liable.",
            "<b>Rav Pappa said: From where</b> do you draw this conclusion? <b>Perhaps</b> in the case where a minority of the congregation performs a transgression on the basis of the ruling of the court, <b>neither do those</b> individuals bring an offering, because they associated their action with the court, <b>nor does</b> the <b>court</b> bring an offering, because it was only a minority of the congregation that performed a transgression on the basis of the ruling of the court.",
            "The Gemara rejects this: <b>If so, why</b> does the <i>tanna</i> <b>specifically seek</b> a source with regard to <b>the majority for liability?</b> Why did the <i>tanna</i> seek to introduce the <i>halakha</i> that even if a majority of the congregation sinned they would be liable to bring an offering? Can one <b>not, by inference,</b> conclude with regard to <b>a minority</b> that acts <b>on</b> the basis of the <b>ruling</b> of the court, that <b>he holds that they are liable</b> even though they acted <b>on</b> the basis of the <b>ruling</b> of the court? According to Rav Pappa’s opinion, <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>first seek</b> to cite proof <b>about a minority that</b> each of its members is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin-offering <b>for unwitting</b> performance <b>of an action, and ultimately seek</b> to cite proof <b>about a majority to</b> establish <b>liability</b> for each of its members to bring a sin-offering <b>for unwitting</b> performance <b>of an action,</b> as it has not yet been established with regard to a minority that each of its members is liable to bring a sin-offering for unwitting performance of an action.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> can one <b>not</b> make an inference <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>did not</b> first <b>seek</b> to cite proof <b>about a minority that</b> each of its members is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin-offering <b>for unwitting</b> performance <b>of an action and then</b> seek to cite proof <b>about a majority to</b> establish <b>liability</b> for each of its members to bring a sin-offering <b>for unwitting</b> performance of <b>an action?</b> Accordingly, one can <b>conclude from it</b> that it was clear to the <i>tanna</i> that in a case of <b>a minority</b> that acts <b>on</b> the basis of the <b>ruling</b> of the court, each member of the minority is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>a female lamb or a female goat</b> as a sin-offering, <b>and for unwitting</b> performance <b>of an action not on</b> the basis of the <b>ruling</b> of the court, each member of the minority is similarly <b>liable.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Now, we learned both of</b> the <i>baraitot</i> <b>unattributed.

            "The mishna continues: If the judges of the <b>court issued a ruling, and</b> at least <b>seven tribes, or a majority of</b> each of those tribes, <b>performed</b> a transgression <b>on the basis of their</b> ruling, the judges <b>bring a bull; and for idol worship they bring a bull and a goat.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The <b>seven tribes that sinned bring seven bulls,</b> i.e., each tribe brings one bull, <b>and</b> each of <b>the rest of the tribes,</b> i.e., those <b>that did not sin, brings</b> one <b>bull on the basis of</b> the sin of the other tribes, <b>as even those who did not sin bring</b> an offering <b>on the basis of</b> the actions of the <b>sinners. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> When seven tribes sin <b>eight bulls</b> are brought as offerings, one bull for each and every tribe and one bull for the court. <b>And for idol worship, eight bulls and eight goats</b> are brought, one <b>bull and</b> one <b>goat for each and every tribe</b> and one <b>bull and</b> one <b>goat for</b> the <b>court.</b>",
            "If the <b>court of one of the tribes issued a ruling and</b> the majority of <b>that tribe performed</b> a transgression <b>on the basis of its</b> ruling, <b>that tribe is liable</b> to bring an offering <b>and the rest of all the tribes</b> are <b>exempt;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. And the Rabbis say: One is liable</b> to bring an offering for an unwitting communal sin <b>only for rulings of the High Court alone, as it is stated: “And if the entire assembly of Israel shall act unwittingly”</b> (Leviticus 4:13), from which it is derived that there is liability only for a ruling of the assembly, i.e., the court, of the entire people, <b>but not</b> for a ruling of <b>the assembly of that</b> particular <b>tribe.</b>",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara elaborates on the dispute cited in the mishna. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In a case where the judges <b>knew that they issued</b> an erroneous <b>ruling, and erred</b> in remembering which erroneous <b>ruling they issued,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they would be liable</b> to bring an offering for this. <b>The verse states: “And the sin</b> that they sinned <b>became known,</b> the congregation shall sacrifice” (Leviticus 4:14), indicating that liability is only in a case where the sin became known to the court that issued the erroneous ruling, <b>and not</b> in a case <b>where it became known</b> only <b>to the sinners.</b> In this case, the sinners are certain that they sinned, but the court does not know the sin with regard to which it issued the ruling.",
            "From the phrase <b>“that they sinned”</b> it is derived: If <b>two tribes sinned they bring two bulls,</b> one from each tribe; if <b>three</b> tribes <b>sinned they bring three</b> bulls, one from each tribe. <b>Or</b> perhaps that phrase <b>says only</b> that if <b>two individuals sinned they bring two bulls,</b> one from each individual; if <b>three</b> individuals <b>sinned they bring three</b> bulls, one from each individual. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “The congregation,”</b> from which it is derived: <b>The congregation</b> is <b>liable, and each and every congregation</b> is <b>liable. How</b> so? If <b>two tribes sinned they bring two bulls.</b> If <b>seven</b> tribes <b>sinned they bring seven</b> bulls. <b>And each</b> of <b>the rest of the tribes that did not sin brings</b> one <b>bull on the basis of</b> the sin of the other tribes, <b>as even those</b> tribes <b>that did not sin bring</b> an offering <b>on the basis of</b> the actions of <b>the sinners. For that</b> reason <b>“congregation” is stated</b> in the verse, <b>to render each and every congregation liable.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Seven tribes that sinned bring seven bulls, and</b> the <b>court brings</b> one <b>bull on the basis of their</b> actions, <b>as</b> the term <b>“congregation” is stated below:</b> “The congregation shall sacrifice” (Leviticus 4:14), <b>and</b> the term <b>“congregation” is stated above:</b> “And the matter is hidden from the eyes of the congregation” (Leviticus 4:13). <b>Just as</b> with regard to the term <b>“congregation” that is stated above</b> the reference is to the <b>court,</b> i.e., “the eyes of the congregation,” together <b>with “the congregation,” so too,</b> with regard to the term <b>“congregation” that is stated below,</b> with regard to liability to bring an offering the reference is to the <b>court</b> together <b>with the congregation.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> In the case of <b>seven tribes that sinned,</b> the <b>court brings a bull on the basis of their</b> sin <b>and</b> the members of the tribe <b>are exempt,</b> as the term <b>“congregation” is stated below:</b> “The congregation shall sacrifice” (Leviticus 4:14), <b>and</b> the term <b>“congregation” is stated above:</b> “And the matter is hidden from the eyes of the congregation” (Leviticus 4:13). <b>Just as</b> with regard to the term <b>“congregation” that is stated above</b> the reference is to the <b>court and not</b> to the <b>public, so too,</b> with regard to the term <b>“congregation” that is stated below</b> the reference is to the <b>court and not</b> to the <b>public.</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says in the name of</b> Rabbi Meir: If <b>six tribes sinned and</b> in terms of population <b>they</b> constitute <b>a majority of</b> the <b>congregation, or</b> if <b>seven</b> tribes, which constitute a majority of the tribes, sinned, <b>even though</b> in terms of population <b>they do not</b> constitute <b>a majority of</b> the <b>congregation,</b> the court <b>brings a bull.</b>",
            "The Gemara proceeds to analyze the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said: “And the sin</b> that they sinned <b>became known,”</b> indicating that liability is only in a case where the sin became known to the court that issued the erroneous ruling <b>and not</b> in a case <b>where it became known</b> only <b>to the sinners. Who is the <i>tanna</i></b> whose opinion is expressed here? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rava</b> who said, <b>that</b> this is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, as we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that there is a dispute with regard to one who had two pieces before him, one of them prohibited because it is forbidden fat and one of them prohibited because it is left over from an offering after the time allotted for its consumption [<i>notar</i>], and he ate one, but does not know whether he ate the forbidden fat or the <i>notar</i>.",
            "<b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Whichever</b> way <b>you</b> look at it, he is liable to bring a sin-offering. <b>If</b> it was forbidden <b>fat</b> that <b>he ate</b> he is <b>liable,</b> and if it was <b><i>notar</i></b> that <b>he ate</b> he is <b>liable.</b> Therefore, he must bring an offering. Likewise, in the case in the <i>baraita</i>, since the court issued an erroneous ruling and it is known that the erroneous ruling was with regard to a matter for which it is liable to bring an offering, according to Rabbi Eliezer it should make no difference that they do not know the precise nature of their error, and they should be liable to bring an offering. Nevertheless, the ruling in the <i>baraita</i> is that they are exempt, counter to what one would expect to be the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer.",
            "<b>Rav Ashi said: Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> one can explain the ruling of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>Here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, it <b>is different, as it is written:</b> “And the sin <b>that they sinned</b> became known” (Leviticus 4:14). The verse underscores that the judges must be aware of the specific sin for which they are liable to bring an offering. The Gemara asks: <b>There too,</b> with regard to an individual sin-offering, <b>isn’t it written:</b> “Or if his sin <b>that he sinned</b> became known to him” (Leviticus 4:23), leading to the same conclusion? The Gemara answers: In the case of the individual sin-offering, <b>that</b> expression <b>is necessary for</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>to exclude</b> one who <b>acts unawares.</b> One is liable to bring a sin-offering for an unwitting transgression only if he performs the action with intent.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds that even one tribe that sinned is liable to bring an offering? The Gemara answers that <b>he holds:</b> There are <b>four</b> mentions of the term <b>congregation written: Congregation, the congregation, congregation, the congregation.</b> The term “the congregation” appears in both verses. Since the Torah could have written the term: Congregation, in both instances, Rabbi Yehuda derives two matters from each of the two terms, one from the term “congregation” itself, and another from the fact that it is written with the definitive article “the.”",
            "<b>One</b> serves <b>to render each and every congregation liable,</b> as a tribe is also called a congregation; <b>and one</b> serves <b>to</b> establish that the <b>ruling is dependent on</b> the <b>court and</b> the <b>action is dependent on the congregation; and one</b> serves <b>to</b> teach the concept of <b>drawing,</b> i.e., a tribe that did not sin is drawn after a tribe that sinned and is liable to bring an offering; <b>and one</b> serves <b>to</b> teach that <b>a tribe that performed</b> a transgression <b>on</b> the basis of <b>the ruling of</b> its tribal <b>court</b> is liable to bring a bull as an unwitting communal sin-offering.",
            "<b>And</b> what is the reasoning of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who holds that seven tribes that sinned bring seven bulls and the court brings one bull? He holds that there are <b>three</b> mentions of the term <b>congregation written.</b> The first two are: <b>The congregation, congregation,</b> which he interprets in the manner that Rabbi Yehuda interpreted. He counts the third and last mention of the term: <b>The congregation,</b> as in the verse: <b>“From the eyes of the congregation.” This is</b> written in <b>the</b> typical <b>manner of the verse, as people say: From the eyes of so-and-so,</b> and the definitive article “the” does not serve to teach another <i>halakha</i>.",
            "Of those three, <b>one</b> serves <b>to render each and every congregation liable,</b> as a tribe is also called congregation, <b>and</b> the <b>other two</b> come so that a verbal analogy can be derived: The term <b>“congregation” is stated below, and</b> the term <b>“congregation” is stated above. Just as</b> with regard to the term “congregation” that is stated <b>there,</b> above, the reference is to the <b>court,</b> i.e., “the eyes of the congregation,” together <b>with the congregation, so too,</b> with regard to the term “congregation” that is stated <b>here</b> concerning liability to bring an offering, the reference is to the <b>court</b> together <b>with the congregation.</b>",
            "<b>And</b> what is the reasoning of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who holds that the court brings a bull on the basis of its sin and the members of the tribe are exempt? <b>He does not derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> from the difference between the terms <b>“congregation”</b> and <b>“the congregation.”</b> He does not consider the addition of the definite article to be significant. <b>Therefore,</b> he holds that there are <b>two</b> mentions of the term <b>congregation written.</b> They are <b>necessary for him to</b> derive: The term <b>“congregation” is stated below, and</b> the term <b>“congregation” is stated above. Just as</b> with regard to the term “congregation” that is stated <b>there,</b> above, the reference is to the <b>court and not</b> to the <b>public, so too</b> with regard to the term “congregation” that is stated <b>here,</b> below, the reference is to the <b>court and not</b> to the <b>public.</b>",
            "<b>And what is the reasoning of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar,</b> who holds that if six tribes sinned and in terms of population they constitute a majority of the congregation, or if seven tribes sinned even though in terms of population they do not constitute a majority of the congregation, the court brings a bull? <b>It is written: “Then it shall be, if</b> it was performed unwittingly, hidden <b>from the eyes of the congregation”</b> (Numbers 15:24). <b>Apparently,</b> the reference is even to <b>a minority</b> of the people, <b>as “from the eyes” is written,</b> indicating: Not all of them, but some of them. <b>And it is written: “As for all the people</b> it was performed <b>unwittingly”</b> (Numbers 15:26), <b>to say that</b> based on the principle: The halakhic status of a majority is like that of the entirety, if <b>the majority</b> of the congregation sinned, then <b>yes,</b> the court is liable to bring an offering.

            "<b>How so?</b> How can this apparent contradiction be resolved?

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Meir, from where do they</b> derive the fact <b>that</b> the <b>ruling is dependent on</b> the <b>court and</b> the <b>action is dependent on the congregation? Abaye said</b> that they derive it from a verse, <b>as the verse states</b> in the passive form: <b>“Then it shall be, if it was performed unwittingly, hidden from the eyes of the congregation”</b> (Number 15:24), indicating that the action of the congregation was generated by the ruling of the court. <b>Rava said:</b> It is derived <b>from</b> that which is stated: <b>“For all the people</b> it was performed <b>unwittingly”</b> (Numbers 15:26). The term “all the people” indicates that the unwitting action is common to all, the court through its ruling and the people through their action.",
            "The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> both of the verses are <b>necessary.

            "The Gemara challenges: <b>But when these verses are written, they are written with regard to</b> an erroneous ruling involving <b>idol worship,</b> not concerning erroneous rulings involving other transgressions.

            "The Gemara asks with regard to the fact that Jehoahaz was anointed: <b>And was there anointing oil</b> during the days of Jehoahaz? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>When the Ark of the Covenant was sequestered, the anointing oil, and the jar of <i>manna</i></b> (see Exodus 16:33), <b>and Aaron’s staff</b> with <b>its almonds and blossoms</b> (see Numbers 17:23), <b>and the chest that the Philistines sent</b> as <b>a gift to Israel,</b> were all <b>sequestered</b> with it, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And you shall take the Ark of the Lord, and lay it upon the cart, <b>and put the vessels of gold that you return Him as a guilt-offering in a chest by its side and send it away that it may go”</b> (I Samuel 6:8).",
            "<b>And who sequestered</b> the Ark? <b>Josiah, king of Judea, sequestered it, as he saw that it is written in the Torah</b> in the portion of rebuke: <b>“The Lord will lead you, and your king</b> whom you shall establish over you, unto a nation that you have not known” (Deuteronomy 28:36). <b>He commanded and</b> the people <b>sequestered them, as it is stated: “And he said to the Levites who taught all Israel, and who were sacred unto the Lord: Place the sacred Ark in the room that Solomon, son of David, king of Israel built; there shall be no more burden upon your shoulders. Now serve the Lord your God and His people Israel”</b> (II Chronicles 35:3).",
            "<b>And Rabbi Elazar says: One derives</b> a verbal analogy between the term: <b>There,</b> written with regard to the Ark (see Exodus 29:43), and the term: <b>There,</b> written with regard to the jar of <i>manna</i> (see Exodus 16:33); and between the term: <b>Keepsake,</b> written with regard to the jar of <i>manna</i> (see Exodus 16:33), and the term: <b>Keepsake,</b> written with regard to Aaron’s staff (see Numbers 17:25–26); and between the term: <b>Generations,</b> written with regard to the jar of <i>manna</i> (see Exodus 16:33), and the term: <b>Generations,</b> written with regard to the anointing oil (see Exodus 30:31). By means of these verbal analogies it is derived that all of these items were sequestered. <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> They anointed Jehoahaz <b>with pure balsam</b> oil, not with anointing oil.",
            "§ <b>The Sages taught: How does one anoint the kings?</b> One smears the oil in a manner that is <b>similar to</b> the form of <b>a crown</b> around his head. <b>And</b> how does one anoint <b>the priests?</b> One smears the oil in a shape <b>like</b> the Greek letter <b>chi.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>Like</b> the Greek letter <b>chi? Rav Menashya bar Gadda said: Like</b> the <b>Greek</b> equivalent of the Hebrew letter <b><i>kaf</i>.</b>",
            "<b>It is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>Initially, they pour oil on</b> the priest’s <b>head, and thereafter, they place oil for him between the lashes of his eyes. And it is taught</b> in <b>a different</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>Initially, they place oil for him between the lashes of his eyes, and thereafter, they pour oil on his head.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>It is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>. Some say: Anointing</b> with oil between his eyes <b>is preferable</b> and takes precedence, <b>and some say: Pouring</b> oil on his head <b>is preferable</b> and takes precedence.",
            "<b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of the one who said</b> that <b>pouring</b> oil on his head <b>is preferable?</b> It is <b>as it is written: “And he poured from the anointing oil upon Aaron’s head and anointed him to sanctify him”</b> (Leviticus 8:12), indicating that pouring precedes anointing. <b>And the one who said</b> that <b>anointing is preferable</b> and takes precedence, <b>what is the reason</b> for his opinion? <b>He holds:</b> Anointing takes precedence <b>as</b> that is what <b>you find with regard to service vessels</b> (see Numbers 7:1). They were anointed, but the anointing oil was not poured on them. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written</b> with regard to the priests: <b>“And he poured,” and ultimately: “And anointed”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is what the verse <b>is saying: What is the reason</b> that <b>he poured</b> the oil? It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that he</b> had already <b>anointed</b> them. Anointing is the primary component of the process.",
            "<b>The Sages taught: “It is like the precious oil upon the head coming down upon the beard, Aaron’s beard,</b> that comes down upon the collar of his garments” (Psalms 133:2). <b>Two drops</b> of anointing oil, <b>shaped like pearls, were suspended for Aaron from his beard. Rav Pappa said</b> that it is <b>taught: When</b> Aaron would <b>speak</b> and his beard would move, those drops would miraculously <b>rise and settle on the roots of his beard</b> so that they would not fall. <b>Moses was concerned about this matter. He said: Perhaps, Heaven forfend, I misused</b> the consecrated <b>anointing oil</b> and poured more than necessary, as two additional drops remain? <b>A Divine Voice emerged and said: “It is like the precious oil</b> upon the head coming down upon the beard, Aaron’s beard, that comes down upon the collar of his garments. <b>Like the dew of Hermon”</b> (Psalms 133:2–3). This analogy teaches: <b>Just as there is no misuse of the dew of Hermon,</b> which is not consecrated, <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>the anointing oil that is on Aaron’s beard, there is no misuse</b> of consecrated property.",
            "<b>And still Aaron was concerned. He said: Perhaps Moses did not misuse</b> consecrated property; <b>but</b> perhaps <b>I misused</b> consecrated property, as the additional oil is on my beard and I enjoy it. <b>A Divine Voice emerged and said: “Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity”</b> (Psalms 133:1). <b>Just as</b> your brother <b>Moses did not misuse</b> consecrated property, <b>so too, you did not misuse</b> consecrated property.",
            "<b>The Sages taught: One anoints the kings only upon a spring,</b> as an omen, <b>so that their kingdom will continue</b> like a spring, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the coronation of Solomon before the death of David: <b>“And the king said unto them: Take with you the servants of your lord,</b> and let Solomon my son ride upon my own mule, <b>and bring him down to Gihon.</b> And let Tzadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel and sound the shofar and say: Long live King Solomon” (I Kings 1:33–34).",
            "§ Apropos good omens, the Gemara cites a statement that <b>Rabbi Ami said: This</b> person <b>who seeks to know if he will complete his year or if</b> he will <b>not,</b> i.e., whether or not he will remain alive in the coming year, <b>let him light a lamp, during the ten days that are between Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur, in a house in which wind does not blow.

            "Apropos good omens, <b>Rav Mesharshiyya said to his son: When you seek to enter and study before your teacher, study the <i>baraita</i></b> first, <b>and</b> only then <b>enter before your teacher.

He added: <b>And</b> it is preferable for you to <b>sit on the rubbish heaps [<i>akilkelei</i>] of Mata Meḥasya, and do not sit in the palaces [<i>appadnei</i>] of Pumbedita.

            "Apropos good omens for anointing, it is stated in the prayer of Hannah, Samuel’s mother: <b>“My horn is exalted in my God”</b> (I Samuel 2:1). The Gemara infers: <b>My horn is exalted, and my jug is not exalted. David and Solomon were anointed with</b> oil from <b>a horn.</b> This was a good omen for them and <b>their reign endured. Saul and Jehu were anointed with</b> oil from <b>a jug and their reign did not endure.</b>",
            "§ The mishna teaches: And who is the anointed priest? It is the High Priest <b>who is anointed with the anointing oil,</b> not the High Priest consecrated by donning multiple garments. <b>The Sages taught: “Anointed”</b> is written in the verse (Leviticus 6:15).

            "The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is this <b>inferred?</b> The Gemara answers: It is <b>as Rava said</b> with regard to the term <b>“the thigh”</b> in the verse: “The sciatic nerve that is on the hollow of the thigh” (Genesis 32:33); the reference is to <b>the stronger of the thighs. Here too,</b> where the verse states: <b>“The anointed,”</b> the reference is to <b>the</b> most <b>distinguished of</b> those <b>anointed,</b> i.e., the High Priest.",
            "The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master said: “Anointed”</b> is written in the verse. One <b>might</b> have thought that the reference is to <b>a king.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is it a bull that a king brings</b> for a sin-offering? <b>It is a male goat that he brings,</b> as the Torah states explicitly, later in that passage. The Gemara answers: It <b>was necessary</b> for the <i>tanna</i> to say this, as it may <b>enter your mind to say:</b> It is <b>for the unwitting</b> performance <b>of an action</b> for which all people are liable to bring a sin-offering that a king <b>shall bring</b> a male goat as his offering; but <b>for absence</b> of awareness <b>of the matter</b> with the unwitting performance of an action, a king <b>shall bring a bull.</b> Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that it is only the High Priest who brings a bull.",
            "§ The mishna teaches: <b>The difference between</b> a High <b>Priest anointed with the anointing oil</b> and one consecrated by donning multiple garments is only that the latter does not bring the bull that comes for the transgression of any of the mitzvot. The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, as, if it was</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A priest who is consecrated by donning <b>multiple garments brings a bull that comes for</b> the transgression of <b>any of the mitzvot;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir, but the Rabbis did not concede</b> that point <b>to him.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir?</b> It is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Anointed”</b> is written in the verse. <b>I have</b> derived <b>only a priest anointed with the anointing oil.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>Shmuel holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who says: Any tear that does not rend his neckline asunder is only a gratuitous tear</b> that serves no purpose.

They sent</b> in response: <b>Sinai is preferable, as the Master said: Everyone requires the owner of the wheat,</b> i.e., one who is expert in the sources. <b>And even so, Rav Yosef did not accept upon himself</b> the appointment of head of the yeshiva. <b>Rabba reigned for twenty-two years, and then Rav Yosef reigned.</b> The Gemara relates that in <b>all those years that Rabba presided,</b> Rav Yosef <b>did not even call a bloodletter to his home.</b> Rav Yosef did not assume even the slightest air of authority, in deference to Rabba, and would go to seek out the bloodletter rather than expecting that the bloodletter would accommodate him.",
            "The Gemara relates: <b>Abaye, Rava, Rabbi Zeira, and Rabba bar Mattana were sitting</b> and studying in a group <b>and were in need</b> of <b>a head</b> for their group. <b>They said: Let anyone who will say a matter</b> that <b>is not refuted be</b> the <b>head. Everyone’s</b> statements <b>were refuted,</b> and the statement <b>of Abaye was not refuted. Rabba saw that Abaye raised his head,</b> i.e., he noticed that his statement was not refuted. Rabba <b>said to him: Naḥmani,</b> calling Abaye by his name rather than by his nickname, <b>begin and say</b> your lecture.",
            "<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Between <b>Rabbi Zeira and Rabba bar Rav Mattana, which of them is preferable? Rabbi Zeira is incisive and raises</b> pertinent <b>difficulties, and Rabba bar Rav Mattana is moderate</b> and not so incisive, <b>but</b> ultimately <b>he draws</b> the appropriate <b>conclusions. What</b> is the conclusion? Which is preferable? The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved."
