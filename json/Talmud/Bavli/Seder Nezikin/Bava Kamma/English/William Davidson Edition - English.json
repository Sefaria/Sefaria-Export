            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There are <b>four primary categories of damage: The</b> category of <b>Ox; and the</b> category of <b>Pit; and the</b> category of <b><i>Maveh</i>,</b> which, based on a discussion in the Gemara refers either to the tooth of an animal that causes damage or to a person who causes damage; <b>and the</b> category of <b>Fire.</b>",
            "Each of these categories is unique; therefore, the <i>halakhot</i> of one cannot be derived from another. The defining characteristic of <b>the</b> primary category of <b>Ox is not similar to</b> the defining characteristic of <b>the</b> primary category of <b><i>Maveh</i>, and</b> the defining characteristic of <b>the</b> primary category of <b><i>Maveh</i> is not similar to</b> the defining characteristic of <b>the</b> primary category of <b>Ox. And</b> the defining characteristics of <b>this</b> category of Ox <b>and that</b> category of <i>Maveh</i>, <b>in which there is a living spirit</b> that causes damage, <b>are not similar to</b> the defining characteristic of <b>the</b> category of <b>Fire, in which there is no living spirit.</b>",
            "The mishna continues: <b>And</b> the defining characteristics of <b>this</b> primary category of Ox and <i>Maveh</i> <b>and that</b> primary category of Fire, <b>in which</b> the <b>typical manner</b> of their components is <b>to proceed</b> from one place to another <b>and</b> cause <b>damage, are not similar to</b> the defining characteristic of <b>the</b> primary category of <b>Pit, in which</b> the <b>typical manner</b> of its components is <b>not to proceed</b> from one place to another <b>and</b> cause <b>damage;</b> rather, it remains in place and the damage is caused by the injured party proceeding and encountering the obstacle.",
            "<b>The common denominator of</b> the components in all of <b>these</b> primary categories is <b>that</b> it is <b>their typical manner to cause damage, and</b> the responsibility for <b>their safeguarding</b> to prevent them from causing damage is incumbent <b>upon you,</b> the owner of the animal or generator of the fire or the pit. <b>And when</b> a component of any of these categories <b>causes damage, the</b> owner or generator of the component that <b>caused</b> the <b>damage is obligated to pay</b> restitution <b>for damage with best</b>-quality <b>land.</b>",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> its ruling employing the term: <b>Primary categories, by inference, there are subcategories</b> of those primary categories. The Gemara asks: Are <b>their subcategories similar to them,</b> i.e., to their respective primary categories, so that the same <i>halakhot</i> apply to them, <b>or</b> are they <b>dissimilar to them?</b>",
            "The Gemara cites additional areas of <i>halakha</i> where there are primary categories and subcategories and considers the relationship between them: <b>With regard to Shabbat we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 73a): <b>The primary categories of labor</b> prohibited on Shabbat number <b>forty-less-one.</b> There too, from the fact that the mishna teaches its ruling employing the term: <b>Primary categories, by inference, there are</b> also <b>subcategories.</b>",
            "With regard to the primary categories of labor prohibited on Shabbat, <b>their subcategories are similar to them,</b> as <b>it is no different</b> if one unwittingly performed labor that is <b>a primary category,</b> for which he is liable to bring <b>a sin-offering, and it is no different</b> if one unwittingly performed labor that is <b>a subcategory,</b> for which he is liable to bring <b>a sin-offering.</b> Likewise, <b>it is no different</b> if one intentionally performed labor that is <b>a primary category,</b> for which he is liable to be executed by <b>stoning, and it is no different</b> if one intentionally performed labor that is <b>a subcategory,</b> for which he is liable to be executed by <b>stoning.</b>",
            "<b>And what</b> difference <b>is there between a primary category and a subcategory?</b> The Gemara explains: The practical <b>difference</b> is <b>that if one</b> unwittingly <b>performs two</b> labors classified as different <b>primary categories together,</b> during a single lapse of awareness, or, <b>alternatively,</b> if one unwittingly performs <b>two</b> labors classified as <b>subcategories</b> of two different primary categories <b>together,</b> during a single lapse of awareness, <b>one is liable</b> to bring a sin-offering <b>for each and every</b> labor that he performed. Each primary category of labor is an independent transgression. <b>While if one</b> unwittingly <b>performs</b> a labor that is <b>a primary category and</b> another labor classified as <b>its subcategory</b> during a single lapse of awareness, <b>he is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> sin-offering.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Rabbi Eliezer, who deems one liable</b> to bring two sin-offerings even if one performs a labor classified as <b>a subcategory together with</b> a labor that is <b>its primary category, why is</b> one labor <b>characterized</b> as <b>a primary category and why is</b> the other labor <b>characterized</b> as <b>a subcategory?</b> The Gemara explains: Of the labors prohibited on Shabbat, <b>that which was a significant</b> labor <b>in the Tabernacle,</b> the Sages <b>characterized</b> it as <b>a primary category,</b> and <b>that which was not a significant labor in the Tabernacle,</b> the Sages <b>characterized</b> it as <b>a subcategory.</b> The labors prohibited on Shabbat are derived from the labors employed in the construction of the Tabernacle; therefore, their classification is also based on their significance in its construction.",
            "<b>With regard to ritual impurities, we learned</b> in the mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 1:1): <b>The primary categories of ritual impurity</b> are as follows: Any of the eight species of <b>the creeping animal</b> enumerated in the Torah (Leviticus 11:29–30), <b>and semen,</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>and one who is impure</b> with impurity imparted by a human <b>corpse.</b> A person, a vessel, or food that is rendered impure through contact with an item classified as a primary category of ritual impurity is characterized as a subcategory. In that domain, <b>their subcategories are dissimilar to them, as</b> any person or item classified as <b>a primary category</b> of ritual impurity <b>impurifies a person and</b> impurifies any <b>vessels</b> with which it comes into contact, <b>while</b> a person or item classified as <b>a subcategory of ritual impurity impurifies food or drink, but does not impurify a person or vessels.</b>",
            "After determining that there are instances where the legal status of subcategories is like that of primary categories, e.g., Shabbat, and there are instances where the legal status of subcategories is dissimilar to that of primary categories, e.g., ritual impurity, the Gemara asks: <b>Here,</b> with regard to the laws of damages, <b>what</b> is the relationship between the primary categories and their subcategories? <b>Rav Pappa said: There are, among</b> the primary categories of damage, some whose subcategories <b>are similar to them, and there are, among them,</b> some whose subcategories <b>are dissimilar to them.</b>",
            "§ Seeking to clarify Rav Pappa’s statement, the Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> that delineates the primary categories of damage. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Three primary categories</b> of damage <b>were stated</b> in the Torah <b>with regard to an ox.</b> An ox causes damage in three ways, and each is classified as a distinct primary category of damage represented by a part of the body of the ox: There is <b>the</b> category of <b>Goring [<i>keren</i>],</b> literally, horn. This is referring to an ox goring a person or an animal and causing damage. <b>And</b> there is <b>the</b> category of <b>Eating [<i>shen</i>],</b> literally, tooth. This is referring to one’s ox causing damage by consuming another person’s produce. <b>And</b> there is <b>the</b> category of <b>Trampling [<i>regel</i>],</b> literally, foot. This is referring to an ox trampling another person’s belongings and causing damage. These are classified as primary categories because they are mentioned explicitly in the Torah.",
            "The Gemara elaborates: <b>From where do we</b> derive the primary category of <b>Goring?</b> The source is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And <b>if</b> an ox <b>gores</b> a man or a woman” (Exodus 21:28); and <b>goring is</b> performed <b>only</b> with <b>a horn, as it is stated: “And Zedekiah, son of Chenaanah, made himself horns of iron, and said: So says the Lord: With these shall you gore the Arameans,</b> until they are consumed” (I Kings 22:11). <b>And</b> the verse also <b>states: “His firstborn bull, majesty is his, and his horns are the horns of the wild ox; with them he shall gore the nations”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:17).",
            "The Gemara interrupts its citation of the <i>baraita</i> and asks: <b>What</b> is the purpose of citing the additional verse introduced with the term: <b>And</b> the verse also <b>states?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>And if you would say</b> that the first verse cited is not a legitimate source as it is a verse from the Prophets, and <b>we do not derive Torah matters from the texts of the tradition,</b> i.e., Prophets and Writings, <b>come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from the Torah: <b>“His firstborn bull, majesty is his.”</b>",
            "The Gemara rejects the possibility that the reason a second verse was cited is that the primary category of Goring cannot be derived from a verse in the Prophets: <b>But is this</b> a halakhic <b>derivation? It is a mere disclosure of the matter, that goring is</b> performed <b>with a horn.</b> A verse in the Prophets can certainly serve as a source for that disclosure.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the reason the <i>baraita</i> cites a second verse is <b>lest you say,</b> based on the first verse, that <b>when the Merciful One distinguishes between</b> liability for damage caused by <b>an innocuous</b> ox, for which the owner is liable to pay half of the damages for the first three times that it gores, <b>and</b> liability for damage caused by <b>a forewarned</b> ox, which already gored three times and whose owner was cautioned to prevent the ox from goring, for which he is liable to pay the full damages, <b>that statement</b> applies only to damage caused <b>with a detached</b> horn, like the horn of Zedekiah described in the verse, e.g., if an animal held a detached horn in its mouth and caused damage with it; <b>but</b> for damage that an ox caused <b>with</b> a horn <b>attached</b> to its head, <b>say</b> that in <b>all</b> cases the legal status of the ox <b>is</b> that of <b>a forewarned</b> ox and its owner is liable to pay for all of the damage.",
            "Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> says: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from another verse: <b>“His firstborn bull, majesty is his,</b> and his horns are the horns of the wild ox; with them he shall gore the nations,” where the reference is to a horn attached to the ox’s head. Evidently, when an ox gores with its own horns there is a distinction between an innocuous ox and a forewarned ox.",
            "The Gemara resumes its citation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is a subcategory of Goring?</b> It includes any action that an ox performs with its body with the objective of inflicting damage: <b>Pushing [<i>negifa</i>], biting, crouching</b> upon items with the objective of inflicting damage, <b>and kicking.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>goring that it is characterized</b> as <b>a primary category</b> of damage, <b>as it is written</b> explicitly in the verse: “And <b>if</b> an ox <b>gores</b> a man or a woman” (Exodus 21:28); accordingly, <b><i>negifa</i></b> should <b>also</b> be characterized as a primary category, <b>as it is written: “If</b> one man’s ox <b>hurts [<i>yiggof</i> ]</b> the ox of another” (Exodus 21:35)? The Gemara answers: <b>This <i>negifa</i></b> mentioned in the verse, <b>is</b> actually a reference to <b>goring, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verses states: “And if one man’s ox hurts [<i>yiggof</i> ] the ox of another…or if it is known that the ox was a goring ox in time past” (Exodus 21:35–36). The verse <b>began</b> its description of the case <b>with</b> the term <b><i>negifa</i> and</b> it <b>concluded with</b> the term <b>goring to say to you</b> that in this context the two terms describe the same action: <b>This</b> action <b>is <i>negifa</i></b> and <b>this</b> same action <b>is goring.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: If the two terms are interchangeable, <b>what is different with regard to</b> an ox goring <b>a person that it is written:</b> “And <b>if</b> an ox <b>gores</b> a man or a woman” (Exodus 21:28), <b>and what is different with regard to</b> an ox goring <b>an animal that it is written: “If</b> one man’s ox <b>hurts [<i>yiggof</i> ]</b> the ox of another” (Exodus 21:35)?",
            "The Gemara explains: With regard to <b>a person, who has</b> the <b>ingenuity</b> to defend himself and is not easily injured, <b>it is written: “If</b> an ox <b>gores,”</b> a term indicating an attack of greater force. With regard to <b>an animal, which does not have</b> the <b>ingenuity</b> to defend itself and is more easily injured, <b>it is written: “If</b> an ox <b>hurts [<i>yiggof</i> ],”</b> a term indicating an attack of lesser force. The term <i>yiggof</i> is related to the term <i>magefa</i>, meaning plague. The Torah employs that term with regard to the goring of an animal to indicate that when an animal is gored, regardless of the force of the blow, it will likely result in its death.",
            "<b>And</b> the Torah’s use of these terms <b>teaches us a matter in passing:</b> Because the effort required for the ox to gore a person to death is greater than the effort required for the ox to gore an animal to death, the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that</b> an ox that is <b>forewarned with regard to</b> goring <b>a person is</b> also <b>forewarned with regard to an animal. But</b> an ox that is <b>forewarned with regard to an animal is not forewarned with regard to a person.</b>",
            "The Gemara questions the classification in the <i>baraita</i> of biting, crouching, and kicking as subcategories of Goring: Isn’t <b>biting a subcategory of Eating,</b> as the animal both eats and bites with its teeth? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> in cases included in the primary category of <b>Eating, there is pleasure</b> for the animal <b>in</b> the course of <b>its</b> causing <b>damage.</b> In <b>this</b> case of damage caused by biting, <b>there is no</b> intrinsic <b>pleasure</b> for the animal <b>in</b> the course of the <b>damage</b> that <b>it</b> causes, as when the ox bites forcefully, the exclusive objective of the action is to cause damage.",
            "The Gemara asks: Aren’t <b>crouching</b> upon items <b>and kicking</b> items in order to damage them each <b>a subcategory of Trampling,</b> as the animal crouches by bending its legs and kicks with its feet? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> in cases included in the primary category of Trampling, the <b>damage is commonplace,</b> as it is caused in the course of the animal’s walking; in <b>these</b> cases of crouching and kicking, the <b>damage is not commonplace,</b> as animals do not typically kick or crouch upon utensils.",
            "After citing the subcategories listed in the <i>baraita</i>, the Gemara resumes its analysis of the statement of Rav Pappa: <b>But</b> with regard to the statement <b>that Rav Pappa said: There are among them</b> some whose subcategories <b>are dissimilar to them, to which</b> primary category was Rav Pappa referring?",
            "<b>If we say</b> that his reference was <b>to these</b> subcategories of Goring, <b>what is different</b> about <b>Goring</b> that defines it as a unique primary category? What is different is <b>that</b> the <b>objective</b> of the ox’s action <b>is to cause damage, and</b> the ox is <b>your property, and</b> responsibility for <b>its safeguarding,</b> to prevent it from causing damage, is incumbent <b>upon you,</b> its owner. In <b>these</b> subcategories of Goring, i.e., pushing [<i>negifa</i>], biting, crouching, and kicking, <b>as well,</b> the <b>objective</b> of the oxen’s actions <b>is to cause damage, and</b> the oxen are <b>your property, and</b> responsibility for <b>their safeguarding,</b> to prevent your oxen from causing damage, is incumbent <b>upon you.</b>",
            "<b>Rather,</b> it is apparent that the status of <b>a subcategory of Goring is like</b> that of the primary category of <b>Goring, and when Rav Pappa says:</b> There are among them some whose subcategories are dissimilar to them, he was referring <b>to Eating and Trampling.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Where are Eating and Trampling written</b> in the Torah that led them to be classified as primary categories? The Gemara answers: The source is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “If a man causes a field or vineyard to be eaten, and he sends forth his animal, and it consumed in the field of another” (Exodus 22:4). The two parts of the verse are referring to different categories: <b>“And he sends forth,” this is</b> a reference to <b>the</b> primary category of <b>Trampling,</b> as sending forth results in the animal trampling another’s produce and damaging it, <b>and likewise it states:</b> “Happy are you that sow beside all waters <b>that send forth the feet of the ox and the donkey”</b> (Isaiah 32:20). Clearly the term “send forth” is a reference to trampling by the feet of the animal.",
            "<b>“And it consumed,” this is</b> a reference to <b>the</b> primary category of <b>Eating, and likewise it states:</b> “And I will utterly sweep away the house of Jeroboam, <b>as one consumes with</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>the tooth until it be all gone”</b> (I Kings 14:10).",
            "<b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i> just cited: <b>“And he sends forth,” this</b> is a reference to <b>the</b> category of <b>Trampling, and likewise it says:</b> “Happy are you that sow beside all waters <b>that send forth the feet of the ox and the donkey”</b> (Isaiah 32:20). The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> that the phrase: “And he sends forth,” is interpreted as a reference to the category of Trampling is <b>that the Merciful One writes: “That send forth the feet of the ox and the donkey.”</b> The Gemara asks: Were <b>it not for this</b> verse, <b>with regard to what would you have interpreted</b> that phrase?",
            "<b>If</b> you say that it could have been interpreted as referring to <b>Goring,</b> that cannot be, as Goring <b>is written</b> in a different verse. <b>If</b> you say that it could have been interpreted as referring to <b>Eating,</b> that too cannot be, as Eating <b>is written</b> in a different verse. Perforce the reference is to Trampling, and the <i>baraita</i> had no need to prove this from the phrase: “That send forth the feet.”",
            "The Gemara answers that it <b>is necessary</b> for the <i>baraita</i> to cite the verse: “That send forth the feet of the ox and the donkey,” as it <b>could enter your mind to say</b> that both <b>this</b> phrase: “And he sends forth,” <b>and that</b> phrase: “And it consumed,” are referring <b>to</b> the primary category of <b>Eating, and that</b> phrase: “And it consumed,” is referring to a case <b>where the object</b> damaged <b>is completely destroyed,</b> and <b>this</b> phrase: “And he sends forth,” is referring to a case <b>where the object</b> damaged <b>is not completely destroyed.</b> Therefore, the verse “that send forth the feet of the ox and the donkey” <b>teaches us</b> that the phrase “and he sends forth,” is referring to Trampling.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And now that we have interpreted</b> that the phrase “and he sends forth” is referring <b>to Trampling, from where do we</b> derive that one is liable with regard to acts categorized as <b>Eating</b> in a case <b>where the object</b> damaged <b>is not completely destroyed?</b> The primary category of Eating is derived from the phrase “and it consumed.” The connotation of that phrase is damage in which the object is completely destroyed.",
            "The Gemara answers: It is derived because the category of Eating is juxtaposed to and therefore <b>similar to</b> the category <b>of Trampling: Just as</b> with regard to liability for the category of <b>Trampling, it is no different</b> if <b>the object</b> damaged <b>is completely destroyed and it is no different</b> if <b>the object</b> damaged <b>is not completely destroyed; so too,</b> with regard to liability for the category of <b>Eating, it is no different</b> whether <b>the object</b> damaged <b>is completely destroyed and it is no different</b> whether <b>the object</b> damaged <b>is not completely destroyed.</b>",

            "Having clarified the sources for the primary categories of Eating and Trampling, the Gemara proceeds to identify their subcategories and to determine whether it was with regard to these primary categories of damage that Rav Pappa said: There are among them some whose subcategories are dissimilar to them. <b>What is a subcategory of Eating?</b> It is a case where, for example, an animal <b>rubbed against a wall for its pleasure</b> and damaged the wall, <b>or</b> where <b>it sullied produce</b> by rolling on it <b>for its pleasure.</b>",

            "§ One of the primary categories of damage enumerated in the mishna is <b>the</b> category of <b><i>Maveh</i> and</b> another is <b>the</b> category of <b>Fire.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b><i>Maveh</i>?

The <i>halakha</i> that one must pay from his best-quality property is stated explicitly in each of those four verses.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so, from where</b> do you know to say that Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Yishmael <b>disagree about</b> a case where <b>the superior-quality</b> land belonging to <b>the injured</b> party <b>and the inferior-quality</b> land belonging to <b>the one liable for the damage</b> are equal in quality, and the one liable for the damage also has land of superior quality, as the dispute was previously interpreted by Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov? <b>Perhaps everyone,</b> including Rabbi Akiva, <b>agrees</b> that <b>we appraise</b> the value of the land <b>of the injured</b> party, <b>and here they disagree with regard to</b> the <b>dispute between Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya and the Rabbis.</b>",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>Rabbi Akiva holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya,</b> that in the case of damage caused by the ox of a common person to the property of the Temple treasury, compensation is collected from superior-quality land belonging to the one liable for the damage. <b>And Rabbi Yishmael holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> that the owner of the ox bears no liability. In other words, perhaps in the <i>baraita</i> recording the dispute between Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva (see 6b), Rabbi Yishmael first taught that land is appraised based on the quality of the injured party’s land, and then, although it is not explicit in the <i>baraita</i>, he continued to state his opinion that the Temple treasury is unable to collect damages. Accordingly, Rabbi Akiva can be understood as having first expressed his agreement concerning the valuation of land and then proceeding to dispute Rabbi Yishmael’s opinion with regard to the Temple treasury.",
            "The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>If it is so</b> that this is the disagreement, then <b>what</b> is the meaning of Rabbi Akiva’s statement: <b>The verse comes only</b> to allow injured parties to collect compensation from superior-quality land? This indicates that Rabbi Akiva disagrees about how to understand this verse.",
            "<b>And furthermore,</b> if the subject is the Temple treasury, <b>what</b> is the meaning of: <b>And</b> by means of <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference one can derive that the Temple treasury of <b>consecrated</b> property collects from superior-quality land. If, as suggested, Rabbi Akiva holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya, then he maintains that damage to consecrated property is dealt with more stringently than damage to another person’s property, in that if one’s ox damages consecrated property one is liable for the full cost of the damage even if the ox was considered innocuous. If damage to consecrated property is dealt with more stringently, there is no basis to derive an <i>a fortiori</i> inference.",
            "<b>And furthermore, didn’t Rav Ashi say:</b> It is <b>taught explicitly</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse: <b>“The best of his field and the best of his vineyard he shall pay”</b> (Exodus 22:4), teaches that the appraisal is of <b>the best of the field of the injured</b> party, <b>and</b> of <b>the best of the vineyard of the injured</b> party. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The appraisal is of <b>the best of the field of the one liable for the damage, and</b> of <b>the best of the vineyard of the one liable for the damage.</b> This clearly indicates that according to Rabbi Akiva compensation is collected from the superior-quality land belonging to the one liable for the damage.",
            "§ The Gemara considers others issues concerning the form in which restitution should be paid: <b>Abaye raises a contradiction</b> and addresses it <b>to Rava: It is written: “The best of his field and of the best of his vineyard he shall pay”</b> (Exodus 22:4), which indicates that from his <b>best</b>-quality land, <b>yes,</b> he shall pay, but from <b>something else, no,</b> he shall not pay.",
            "<b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit and not cover it, and an ox or a donkey fall therein, the owner of the pit shall pay; <b>he shall recompense</b> money to its owners” (Exodus 21:33–34)? Since the verse states: “The owner of the pit shall pay,” the additional term “he shall recompense” is superfluous. It therefore serves <b>to include</b> any item <b>worth money, and even bran,</b> a relatively inferior commodity, as valid forms of restitution.",
            "Rava resolves the contradiction: This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> the term “he shall recompense” is referring to a case where he pays <b>of his own volition,</b> without being taken to court, and he may therefore use any form of payment. <b>There,</b> the phrase “of the best of his field” is referring to a case where he pays <b>against his will,</b> after the injured party has sued him in court. Since he caused the injured party additional trouble, he must pay using his best-quality land.",
            "<b>Ulla, son of Rav Ilai, said:</b> According to this explanation, the language of the verse <b>is also precise, as it is written: “He shall pay,”</b> a term that, as opposed to: “He shall recompense,” connotes that he is forced to pay <b>against his will.</b>",
            "<b>Abaye said to him</b> that the precise meaning of the verse does not indicate that he is paying against his will: <b>Is it written: He shall be paid,</b> in the passive form, which would clearly indicate that he did not voluntarily initiate the payment himself but rather is paying against his will? No; <b>“he shall pay” is written,</b> which can also <b>indicate</b> that he pays <b>of his own volition.</b>",
            "<b>Rather, Abaye said</b> an alternative resolution, <b>similar to that</b> with which the <b>Master,</b> i.e., Abaye’s teacher, Rabba, employed in order to resolve a different difficulty. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A wealthy person is not entitled to take a poor man’s tithe. He is instead expected to sell his assets and purchase food with the proceeds. But in the case of an individual <b>who owns houses, fields, and vineyards, but</b> at the present time <b>cannot find</b> buyers <b>to</b> whom he can <b>sell them,</b> one <b>may feed him</b> with food from the <b>poor man’s tithe up until half</b> the value of his assets.",
            "<b>And</b> the Master <b>discussed it</b> and asked: <b>What are the circumstances</b> that led to him being unable to sell his land? <b>If everyone’s land depreciated</b> in value, <b>and his</b> land <b>also depreciated along with theirs, let us provide him</b> with <b>even more</b> than half the value of his assets, <b>as,</b> since <b>everyone’s land also depreciated,</b> the market value of his property is low and he is genuinely classified as a poor person, who may take as much poor man’s tithe as is given to him.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> it must be <b>that everyone</b> else’s <b>land appreciated</b> in value, <b>and</b> with regard to <b>his land, since</b> people see <b>that he goes in and goes out for money,</b> i.e., he is in need of money, they reason that he will be forced to accept a lower offer for his property. Consequently, <b>his land depreciated</b> in value."
        ],
        [
            "The Gemara asks: But if that is the case, <b>we should not provide him with even a slight</b> amount of poor man’s tithe. Since his assets, based on their market value, have a high value, he is not to be classified as a poor person.",
            "<b>And the Master,</b> Rabba, <b>said concerning this: No,</b> the <i>halakha</i> that he is provided with only up to half the value of his assets is <b>necessary</b> in a case where he cannot sell due to seasonal fluctuations in price. This is <b>because in the days</b> of the month <b>of Nisan,</b> which is the beginning of the harvest season, the market value of <b>land appreciates, and in the days</b> of the month <b>of Tishrei,</b> a time when the harvest had already been reaped and it is too late to prepare the land for the coming year, the market value of <b>land depreciates.</b>",
            "Consequently, <b>everyone</b> generally <b>waits until Nisan and sells</b> only at that point. <b>But this</b> person, <b>since he is in need of money, sells</b> his land in Tishrei <b>according to the current,</b> lower, market price. Accordingly, based on the current market prices, his assets have a low value and there is justification in regarding him as a poor person. Yet, since if he waited until Nisan, as everyone else does, his land would have a high value, he cannot truly be classified as a poor person. Therefore, he is permitted to take only as much poor man’s tithe as will cover his losses. The Gemara explains why he is permitted to take only up to half the value of his land: Since <b>it is the nature of</b> land <b>to depreciate up to half</b> its value, and it is <b>not its nature to depreciate more</b> than that, he is entitled to take poor man’s tithe that is worth up to half the value of his land and the rest he can supplement by selling his land at its current, lower price.",
            "Abaye uses a similar distinction to resolve the contradiction he raises: <b>And here also, with regard to damages,</b> if one considers a case where the injured party comes to collect his damages during Tishrei, <b>his legal right</b> is to collect payment <b>from superior-quality</b> land. This will be a relatively large amount of land, owing to the current seasonal depreciation in its value.",
            "<b>But if</b> the injured party <b>says to</b> the one liable for the damage: <b>Give me slightly more land of intermediate quality</b> instead, then the one liable for the damage <b>can say to him: If you</b> choose to <b>take</b> superior-quality land, <b>as is your legal right, take</b> a large amount <b>in accordance with the current</b> market value; <b>but if not,</b> and you wish to take intermediate-quality land, <b>take according to the future</b> value in Nisan, after it will have <b>appreciated,</b> which will mean you will be entitled to a smaller amount of land. This can be used to resolve the contradiction: The phrase “of the best of his field,” which indicates that payment is made only from superior-quality land, defines the injured party’s basic rights. The term “he shall recompense,” which indicates that payment may be made in any form, is referring to a case where the injured party forgoes his rights. In such a case the value of the land or item he agrees to receive is appraised based on its appreciated value at the season when it is generally sold.",
            "<b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov objects to this</b> suggestion: <b>If so, you have weakened the power of injured</b> parties <b>with regard to intermediate-quality and inferior-quality</b> land, as, by agreeing to receive land of a lower quality than that to which their rights entitle them, they will actually receive less land, since the land is then appraised based on the appreciated market values in Nisan. Such an opinion is untenable, <b>as the Merciful One states</b> that injured parties collect <b>from the best</b>-quality land, clearly intending to enhance their rights, <b>and</b> yet <b>you said</b> he <b>cannot also</b> collect <b>from intermediate-quality and inferior-quality</b> land unless he agrees that the land should be appraised based on the appreciated Nisan values, thereby lowering the value of his payment.",
            "<b>Rather, Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: If there is</b> a case <b>to compare to</b> Rabba’s distinction, it is not compared to a case of payment of damages, but <b>we can compare it to</b> a case of <b>a creditor</b> who comes to collect the loan during Tishrei. <b>His legal right is</b> to collect <b>from</b> the borrower’s <b>intermediate-quality</b> land, which will be a relatively large amount owing to the current seasonal depreciation in the value of land. <b>But if</b> the creditor <b>says to</b> the borrower: <b>Give me slightly more land of inferior quality</b> instead, the borrower <b>can say to him: If you</b> choose to <b>take</b> the intermediate-quality land, <b>as is your legal right, take</b> a large amount <b>in accordance with the current</b> market value, <b>but if not,</b> and you wish to take land of inferior quality, <b>take</b> it <b>in accordance with the future, appreciated,</b> market value in the month of Nisan. This would mean that the creditor would be entitled to a smaller amount of land.",
            "<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, objects to this</b> suggestion: <b>If so, you have locked the door in the face of</b> potential <b>borrowers, as,</b> according to your suggestion, the creditor is in a disadvantageous position. <b>He can say to</b> the borrower: <b>Were I</b> still <b>to have</b> the <b>money</b> I lent you, <b>I would</b> be able to <b>purchase</b> a large parcel of land <b>in accordance with the current</b> depreciated market value, so why, <b>now that the money is with you, should I</b> be forced to <b>purchase</b> land <b>in accordance with the future, appreciated</b> market value of the month of Nisan? If people are penalized as a result of granting loans, they will cease to do so.",
            "<b>Rather, Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said: If there is</b> a case <b>to compare to</b> Rabba’s distinction, <b>we can compare it to</b> the collection of <b>a woman’s marriage contract</b> where she comes to collect it during Tishrei. <b>As a woman’s legal right</b> in <b>a marriage contract</b> is to collect payment <b>from</b> her husband’s <b>inferior-quality</b> land, which will be a relatively large amount owing to the current seasonal depreciation in the value of land. <b>But if she says to</b> her former husband: <b>Give me slightly less land of intermediate quality</b> instead, her former husband <b>can say to her: If you</b> choose to <b>take</b> the lowest-quality land, <b>as is your legal right, take</b> a large amount <b>in accordance with the current</b> market value, <b>but if not,</b> and you wish to take land of a higher quality, <b>take in accordance with the future appreciated</b> market value of the month of Nisan, which will mean you will be entitled only to a smaller amount of land.",
            "The Gemara returns to examine the contradiction raised by Abaye: <b>In any case,</b> the original <b>difficulty</b> still remains.",
            "<b>Rava said: Whatever he gives</b> the injured party as payment <b>he must give him of the best</b> of that type. For example, even if he pays in bran he must pay with his best-quality bran, and this is the meaning of the phrase “of the best of his field.” Accordingly, the contradiction is resolved. The term “he shall recompense” indicates that payment can be given in any form, but the phrase “of the best of his field” indicates only that whichever form of payment is used, it must be of a superior quality, and not, as Abaye initially understood it, as limiting the form of payment specifically to land of superior quality.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t “the best of his field” written,</b> which suggests that the requirement to pay with one’s best land applies only when one pays with land?",
            "<b>Rather, when Rav Pappa and Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, came from Rav’s academy, they explained it</b> as follows: With regard to payment, <b>all items are</b> classified as property of the <b>best</b> quality, <b>as, if</b> an item <b>cannot be sold here, it can be sold in another city.</b> Since movable items are easily liquidated, they are always considered an acceptable form of payment. This is <b>with the exception of land,</b> which is not always easily sold. Therefore, the <i>halakha</i> is that the one liable for the damage <b>must give</b> the injured party payment <b>from his best</b>-quality land, which is easier to sell. This is <b>in order</b> to ensure the possibility <b>that a buyer will jump at</b> the opportunity to purchase <b>it,</b> thereby providing the injured party with the possibility of liquidating it. This resolves the contradiction. The phrase “of the best of his field” indicates that if payment is made with land it must be with superior-quality land, and the term “he shall recompense” indicates that if payment is made from movable property, anything worth money may be used.",
            "§ <b>Rav Shmuel bar Abba from Akronya asked Rabbi Abba: When</b> the court <b>appraises</b> land to determine if it is to be classified as being of superior-quality, does <b>it appraise</b> land <b>based on</b> the quality of a property owner’s other land <b>or</b> does <b>it appraise</b> it <b>based on</b> the quality of the land in <b>the world</b> at large?",
            "The Gemara notes: <b>Do not raise the dilemma in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, as he says</b> that <b>we appraise</b> land <b>based on</b> the quality of land owned by the <b>injured</b> party, and therefore payment is made with land that is of a similar quality to the best-quality land of the injured party. Accordingly, it is obvious that the classification is based only on the land of the injured party.",
            "<b>When you raise this dilemma,</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who says</b> that <b>we appraise</b> land <b>based on</b> the quality of land owned by <b>the one liable for the damage,</b> and he pays with his superior-quality land even if its quality exceeds that of any of the injured party’s land. Consequently, according to Rabbi Akiva it is appropriate to ask whether the appraisal is based only on his other land or based on the land in the world at large.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the answer to the dilemma? When <b>the Merciful One states: “The best of his field”</b> (Exodus 22:4), does the stress in the verse on “his field” serve <b>to exclude</b> only the possibility of appraising land based solely on the value of the land <b>of the injured</b> party, but land is appraised based on the quality of land in the world at large? <b>Or perhaps,</b> does it serve <b>to exclude</b> the possibility of appraising land based on the quality of land <b>of the world</b> at large <b>as well,</b> and it is sufficient if the land he pays with is his best-quality land?",
            "Rabbi Abba <b>said to him: The Merciful One states: “The best of his field,” and you say</b> the court <b>appraises</b> land <b>based on</b> the quality of land in <b>the world</b> at large?

            "Rav Shmuel bar Abba <b>raised an objection to</b> this opinion from a <i>baraita</i> that delineates the forms of payment used for paying damages, repaying a debt to a creditor, and paying a marriage contract: If the debtor <b>has only superior-quality</b> land, <b>all of them collect from the superior-quality</b> land.

This clause demonstrates that the quality of land is appraised objectively based on the standard of the world at large. The reason for this is that <b>if you say</b> that the court <b>appraises</b> land <b>based on</b> the quality of the land of the one liable for the damage, <b>let his intermediate-quality</b> land <b>be classified as superior-quality</b> land, as that is the best land he owns, <b>and</b> consequently, the <b>creditor should be directed to</b> collect the debt from the <b>inferior-quality</b> land.",
            "The Gemara rejects this: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> This is a case <b>where</b> at the time the borrower took the loan <b>he</b> also <b>had superior-quality</b> land <b>and he</b> subsequently <b>sold it.</b> Accordingly, no matter how land is appraised, at the time that the loan was given his intermediate-quality land would be classified as being of intermediate quality. Consequently, the creditor’s lien on the borrower’s land, which took effect from the moment the loan was given, takes effect with regard to the intermediate-quality land. Therefore, the creditor retains his right to collect from that land, regardless of the fact that by the time of collection it was the borrower’s best land and at that point could be reclassified as land of superior quality.",

            "§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Ketubot</i> 12:3): If one owes money to pay damages, repay a loan, and pay a woman’s marriage contract, and he owns inferior-quality, intermediate-quality, and superior-quality land, and he sells all of his land, then if he <b>sold</b> all of the land <b>to one</b> person <b>or to three people simultaneously, all</b> the buyers <b>replace the</b> land’s prior <b>owner</b> with regard to repayment of his debts. At the time when each debt was created, each creditor gained a lien on the plots of the debtor’s land, from which they have a right to collect. As a lien remains in effect even if the land is sold, then even after the sale, each creditor can collect from the plots of land upon which they have a lien. Accordingly, damages are collected from the superior-quality land, the loan is repaid from the intermediate-quality land, and the marriage contract is paid from the inferior-quality land.",
            "If he sold his plots of land <b>one after the other, all</b> the creditors <b>collect from the last</b> buyer, regardless of the quality of the land he purchased.

The Sages instituted that creditors may not collect from land that a debtor sold, even though it is technically still liened to them, as long as the debtor still has sufficient means with which to repay the debt (see <i>Gittin</i> 48b). Accordingly, after the sale of the first plot of land, the creditors’ rights to collect are restricted to the land that remains in the possession of the debtor, and consequently they gain a lien on it, irrespective of its quality. Therefore, even if that land is subsequently sold, their rights to collect are restricted to that land, and only if the value of that land is insufficient to cover the cost of the debt may they utilize the original liens they had on the plots of land that were sold first.",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But what is different</b> about the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i>, where the plots of land were sold to <b>three</b> buyers, one after the other, and the creditors collect only from the last buyer? It is different in <b>that each one</b> of the first two buyers <b>can say to</b> any creditor who tries to seize the land they purchased: Do not collect my land, as <b>I left a place for you,</b> a plot of land in the debtor’s possession, <b>from which to collect.</b> In other words, when the first two buyers purchased their land a plot of land remained with the debtor, and therefore the creditor’s rights of collection are restricted to that land.",
            "The Gemara continues its question: In <b>this</b> case <b>as well,</b> where all the plots of land were sold to a single buyer, <b>with regard to each one</b> of the first two plots of land that were sold, <b>let</b> the buyer <b>say to</b> any creditor who tries to collect: With my purchase of the first two plots of land, <b>I left a place for you,</b> a plot of land in the debtor’s possession, <b>from which to collect.</b> Therefore, even though the debtor subsequently sold the buyer all of the land, the creditor’s rights of collection are restricted to the last plot of land the debtor sold the buyer, irrespective of its quality. Why then does the <i>baraita</i> rule that in this case each creditor collects from the land that was originally liened to him?",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> This is a case <b>where</b> the individual buyer <b>purchased</b> the <b>superior-quality</b> land <b>last.</b> Accordingly, the buyer is satisfied with allowing each creditor to collect from the land that was previously liened to him, rather than having them each collect from the superior-quality land. <b>And so says Rav Sheshet:</b> It is a case <b>where</b> the individual buyer <b>purchased</b> the <b>superior-quality</b> land <b>last.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so, let them all come and collect from</b> the <b>superior-quality</b> land, as their rights to collect should be restricted to it, since it was purchased last.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Because he can say</b> the following threat <b>to them: If you are silent</b> and do not insist on collecting from the superior-quality land, <b>and take</b> the land of a quality that is due to you <b>according to your</b> standard <b>legal rights,</b> as in a case where you collect directly from the debtor, i.e., the injured party will collect from the superior-quality land, the creditor from the intermediate-quality land, and the woman will collect her marriage contract from the inferior-quality land, then <b>take</b> that land and I will allow you to do so. <b>But if not,</b> and you insist on taking the superior-quality land that I purchased last, then <b>I will return the bill</b> of sale <b>of the inferior-quality</b> land <b>to its</b> prior <b>owner,</b> i.e., the debtor, <b>and you will all</b> be forced to collect <b>from</b> the <b>inferior-quality</b> land, because whenever the debtor has land in his possession you are able to collect the debts only from him.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> that this is the reason for the ruling in the <i>baraita</i>,"
        ],
        [
            "then <b>also with regard to damages, let</b> the buyer <b>say this</b> to the injured party. He could threaten to return the bill of sale of the inferior-quality land to the debtor, which would force the injured party to collect directly from the debtor’s inferior-quality land. Since the buyer can do so, he can effectively force the injured party to collect from the purchased intermediate-quality land instead of fulfilling his right to collect from superior-quality land. Yet, the <i>baraita</i> teaches that in this case each party collects from the land that was originally liened to him, which means that damages are collected from the superior-quality land, indicating that this threat would not be effective.",
            "<b>Rather, with what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing <b>with</b> a case in which the debtor died and his inheritors are his <b>orphans, who are not subject to</b> an obligation to <b>repay</b> the debts of their father. When one dies, his monetary debts are not inherited by his children. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>the lien of</b> the creditor <b>rests</b> solely <b>upon the buyer</b> of the land. Any lien that was in effect with regard to the land he owned at the time he incurred the obligation remains, and his creditors can therefore collect what they are owed from that land, even if it is in the possession of a buyer.",
            "<b>Therefore, one cannot say</b> that the ruling in the <i>baraita</i> is based on the fact that the buyer can threaten to return the bill of sale to the debtor, or in this case, to his orphans. In this case, even if he were to return the bill of sale, the creditors would not be able to collect from the land now in the orphans’ possession, as they received it anew, not as an inheritance from their father. Therefore, the creditors can still collect from the plots of land that remain with the buyer.",
            "The Gemara suggests another explanation of the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>Rather,</b> not all the creditors collect from the superior-quality land, which was the last plot of land purchased from the debtor, <b>because</b> the buyer <b>can say to them: What is the reason</b> that <b>the Sages said one is not paid from liened</b> property, i.e., property liened to a creditor that has been sold by the debtor, <b>whenever there is unsold</b> property still in the debtor’s possession? It is <b>due to an ordinance</b> created solely <b>for my</b> benefit, as I should not be expected to pay from the land I purchased when the debtor is still able to pay. If that ordinance were to be in effect in this case, all of their liens would be in effect with regard to the superior-quality land, as that was purchased last. In this case <b>I do not</b> find <b>this ordinance satisfactory to me,</b> and I would prefer for the lien of each creditor to remain in effect with regard to the land it had been on initially, and I will give each of you that land.",
            "The Gemara notes: This fact that one is not required to avail himself of the financial benefit provided by a rabbinic ordinance <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava. As Rava says: Anyone who says: I do not want</b> to avail myself <b>of</b> the financial benefit provided by <b>an ordinance of the Sages, such as this</b> one, <b>one listens to him.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does Rava mean by saying: An ordinance of the Sages, <b>such as this</b> one?",
            "The Gemara answers: His statement is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Huna. As Rav Huna says:</b> The Sages enacted that a husband must sustain his wife. They also enacted that he receives her earnings in exchange. Yet, <b>a wife is</b> legally <b>entitled to say to her husband: I will not be sustained</b> by you, <b>and</b> in turn <b>I will not work</b> i.e., you will not keep my earnings. Since his obligation to sustain her is only for her benefit, she may forgo her sustenance and retain her earnings for herself.",
            "The Gemara discusses a limitation on the buyer’s ability to refuse the benefit of the rabbinic ordinance: <b>It is obvious</b> that if the <b>buyer sold,</b> of the land he purchased from the debtor, the <b>intermediate- and inferior-quality</b> land to another buyer <b>and retained in his possession</b> only the <b>superior-quality</b> land, which he had purchased last, <b>then all</b> the creditors <b>may come and collect from</b> the <b>superior-quality</b> land.",
            "<b>For</b> if the intermediate-quality and inferior quality land were in his possession, <b>he would be able to say to</b> the creditors: <b>Collect from</b> the <b>intermediate-quality</b> land and from the <b>inferior-quality</b> land, as <b>it is not satisfactory to me</b> to avail myself of the <b>ordinance of the Sages</b>. Now that he has sold the land of intermediate and inferior quality, however, he cannot unilaterally waive the ordinance without the consent of the second buyer. The second buyer benefits from the ordinance, since it compels the creditors to collect from the first buyer, and he will therefore certainly not agree to waive it.",
            "<b>But if</b> the first buyer <b>sold</b> only the <b>superior-quality</b> land that he had purchased last, <b>and</b> he <b>retained</b> in his possession the <b>intermediate-quality and inferior-quality</b> land, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>?",
            "<b>Abaye thought to say: All</b> the creditors <b>should come</b> and <b>collect from</b> the <b>superior-quality</b> land. Since that land was the last plot of land in the debtor’s possession, the creditors’ right of collection was restricted to that land, irrespective of the fact that it was then subsequently sold twice.",
            "<b>Rava said to him: What has the first</b> person <b>sold to the second</b> in any sale? <b>Any rights that will come into his possession. And since, if</b> the creditors <b>were to come to</b> the <b>first buyer</b> while he was still in possession of all three plots of land, <b>he could have had them collect from</b> the <b>intermediate-quality and inferior-quality</b> land; <b>and</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even though when he</b> initially <b>purchased</b> the <b>intermediate-quality and inferior-quality</b> land the <b>superior-quality</b> land <b>was</b> still <b>unsold</b> property in the debtor’s possession. As although there is the rabbinic ordinance that <b>one does not exact payment from liened property when there is unsold</b> property still in the debtor’s possession, the buyer <b>could have said to them: I do not</b> find <b>this ordinance satisfactory to me.</b>",
            "Rava continues: Therefore, since the first buyer had the right to say this, the <b>second buyer can also say to them: Collect</b> from the <b>intermediate-quality and inferior-quality</b> land in the first buyer’s possession. <b>As, when the second buyer purchased</b> the superior-quality land, <b>he purchased</b> it <b>with the understanding that he</b> also acquired <b>all the rights that the first</b> buyer <b>had with regard to</b> that land. Accordingly, he also acquires the right to insist that the creditors collect from the intermediate-quality and inferior-quality land.",
            "In a related ruling, <b>Rava says:</b> In the case of <b>Reuven, who sold all of his fields to Shimon</b> simultaneously <b>and Shimon proceeded to sell one field</b> of those purchased <b>to Levi, and Reuven’s creditor came</b> to collect the debt, if the creditor so <b>desires, he collects from this</b> one, i.e., Shimon, and if <b>he</b> so <b>desires, he collects from that</b> one, i.e., Levi. <b>And we said this only</b> in a case <b>where</b> Levi <b>purchased intermediate-quality</b> land from Shimon. A creditor’s right is to collect the debt from intermediate-quality land. Accordingly, in this case, Reuven’s creditor can collect his loan from the intermediate-quality land even after it has been transferred into Levi’s possession. Nevertheless, if he so desires, he may insist on collecting his loan from any inferior-quality land left in Shimon’s possession. This is because a creditor also has the right to demand payment from a borrower’s inferior-quality land instead of his intermediate-quality land, and therefore that land is also liened to the loan.",
            "<b>But</b> if Levi <b>purchased superior-quality and inferior-quality</b> land from Shimon, <b>no,</b> the creditor can collect only from Shimon’s intermediate-quality land, <b>as</b> Levi could <b>say to him: For this</b> reason <b>I was particular to purchase superior-quality and inferior-quality</b> land, which is <b>land that is not fit for you</b> to collect from as a creditor.",
            "<b>And if</b> Levi <b>purchased</b> the <b>intermediate-quality</b> land from Shimon <b>as well, we said</b> that Reuven’s creditor can collect from him <b>only</b> in a case <b>where he did not leave</b> some <b>similar intermediate-quality</b> land in Shimon’s possession, <b>as</b> in that case, Levi <b>is unable to say to</b> the creditor: <b>I left a place for you,</b> i.e., a plot of land, <b>in Shimon’s possession,</b> from which to collect. <b>But</b> where Levi <b>did leave</b> some <b>similar intermediate-quality</b> land <b>in Shimon’s possession,</b> the creditor <b>does not collect from</b> Levi, <b>as</b> Levi <b>is able to say to him: I left a place for you from which to collect.</b>",
            "In another related ruling, <b>Abaye says:</b> In the case of <b>Reuven, who sold a field</b> liened to his creditor <b>to Shimon with a guarantee,</b> meaning that Reuven agreed to reimburse Shimon should Reuven’s creditor collect the debt from that field, <b>and Reuven’s creditor came and seized</b> the field <b>from Shimon, the <i>halakha</i> is that Reuven</b> can <b>go and litigate with</b> his creditor and claim that he had already repaid the debt, and insist that the field be returned to Shimon. <b>And</b> the creditor <b>is unable to say to</b> Reuven: <b>I am not legally answerable to you,</b> as I am not taking away your land, since you sold it to Shimon.

            "<b>What is the reason</b> that he cannot retract his agreement to the transaction once he has taken possession? <b>As</b> Reuven <b>says to him:</b> The purchase of the land was like purchasing <b>a tied bag [<i>ḥayta</i>]</b> whose contents are unknown and might not have any value.

The reason is that if the claimants succeed with their claims and seize the land, Reuven will then have to return the sum Shimon paid for it. In order to minimize judicial proceedings, the court allows Shimon to claim that there is no point in paying Reuven now only to have his money returned to him later. Therefore, he can retract his agreement to the transaction.",

            "§ The Gemara returns to its earlier discussion concerning the form of the payment of damages: <b>Rav Huna says:</b> Damages are paid <b>either</b> with <b>money or</b> with one’s best-quality land.",
            "<b>Rav Naḥman raised an objection to Rav Huna</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“He shall recompense</b> money to its owner” (Exodus 21:34), which serves <b>to include</b> items <b>worth money, even bran,</b> a relatively inferior commodity, as valid forms of payment.",
            "Rav Huna replied: <b>With what are we dealing here</b> in the <i>baraita</i>? We are dealing with a case <b>where he does not have</b> any money or land. The Gemara asks: <b>If he does not have</b> any other means with which to pay, isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that he can pay using what he has? The Gemara explains: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>we</b> would <b>say to him: Go</b> to the <b>trouble</b> of <b>selling</b> whatever commodity you own, <b>and</b> thereby <b>bring him money</b> as payment for the damage, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that it is unnecessary to sell one’s possessions and pay with money.",
            "<b>Rav Asi says: Money is equivalent to land.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> are they equivalent? <b>If we say</b> that it is <b>with regard to</b> fulfilling the requirement of paying with one’s best-quality land, meaning that he can choose to pay with money instead, <b>this is</b> precisely the ruling <b>of Rav Huna;</b> and yet the ruling of Rav Asi is presented as an independent ruling.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> Rav Asi is referring <b>to</b> a case of <b>two brothers who divided</b> their inheritance, <b>and one took land and</b> the other <b>one</b> took <b>money, and</b> subsequently their father’s <b>creditor came and took</b> the <b>land,</b> as it was liened to his loan. Rav Asi’s ruling teaches <b>that this</b> brother whose land was taken can <b>go and take a half</b> share <b>of the money together with</b> his brother.",
            "The Gemara rejects this explanation: Isn’t that <b>obvious?</b> Is <b>this</b> one <b>a son and that</b> one <b>not a son?</b> Since they are both sons and equally inherited the estate of their father, they share responsibility for their father’s debts. If the creditor takes repayment of the debt from one brother, the other one must reimburse him.",
            "<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that the Gemara rejects this explanation not because it is obvious, but <b>on the contrary,</b> because it is incorrect.

Rav Asi’s ruling teaches that this may be done either by redistributing the remaining portion of land or by reimbursing him with money.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Rav Asi</b> already explicitly <b>say that</b> ruling <b>once before?</b> Therefore, this cannot be the explanation of this ruling. <b>As it was stated:</b> In a case of <b>brothers who divided</b> the land they inherited from their father, <b>and</b> their father’s <b>creditor came and took</b> the <b>portion of one of them, Rav says</b> that the initial <b>division</b> of the land is <b>voided</b> and any remaining land is divided equally between the brothers. <b>Shmuel says</b> that each brother, upon taking his portion, <b>relinquished [<i>viter</i>]</b> any rights to be reimbursed if his portion were lost. <b>And Rav Asi says</b> that the brother whose portion was seized has a right to receive half of the remaining inheritance: <b>He takes a quarter in land, and</b> he takes the other <b>quarter in money.</b>",
            "The Gemara explains the rationale behind each opinion: <b>Rav says</b> that the initial <b>division</b> of the land is <b>voided.</b> This is because <b>he holds</b> that <b>brothers who divided</b> their inheritance <b>are</b> considered to still be <b>similar to heirs</b> with respect to the inheritance, and therefore they continue to share joint responsibility for their father’s debts. Consequently, any remaining land is divided equally between the brothers.",
            "<b>And Shmuel says</b> that each brother, upon taking his portion, <b>relinquished</b> any rights to be reimbursed if his portion were lost, as <b>he holds</b> that <b>brothers who divided</b> their inheritance are considered to be like <b>buyers</b> of their respective portions, <b>and</b> each one is considered to be <b>similar to a buyer</b> who bought his portion <b>without a guarantee</b> that would have provided him with a right to be reimbursed if his portion were seized by a creditor.",
            "<b>And Rav Asi says</b> that the brother whose portion was seized has the right to receive half the remaining inheritance. <b>He takes a quarter in land and</b> he takes the other <b>quarter in money.</b> This is because <b>he is uncertain</b> as to <b>whether they are similar to heirs,</b> in which case the remaining land should be redistributed between them, or <b>whether they are similar to buyers</b> who bought their portions with a guarantee, in which case the brother whose portion was taken should be reimbursed by his brother with a sum of money equal to the value of the land that was seized from him. <b>Therefore, he takes a quarter in land and</b> he takes the other <b>quarter in money.</b>",
            "As Rav Asi had already stated the <i>halakha</i> of brothers who divided their inheritance, the Gemara suggests another explanation of his statement. <b>Rather,</b> with regard to <b>what</b> did Rav Asi state that money <b>is equivalent to land?</b> He stated it <b>with regard to</b> the requirement of paying with one’s best-quality land, and is teaching that one may choose to pay with money instead of land.",

            "The Gemara returns to its initial suggestion: <b>Actually,</b> the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> is stated <b>with regard to a tethered ox or a covered pit, and</b> the case <b>in the corresponding</b> situation <b>of fire,</b> where he is not liable, is where one transferred <b>an ember</b> to one of limited halakhic competence. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>that</b> which <b>you said</b> in order to reject this: <b>What is different here</b> in the case of an ox and a pit that causes him to be liable <b>and what is different there</b> in the case of the fire, that exempts him from liability? Seemingly, in all these cases the item was not able to cause damage in its current form, so he is exempt from liability.",
            "The Gemara explains: You could answer as follows: The typical <b>manner of an ox is to free</b> itself from being tethered and the typical <b>manner of a pit is</b> for its cover <b>to become dislodged.</b> Therefore, as it is negligent to transfer an ox or pit to someone who is incapable of sufficiently safeguarding them, the one who transferred the ox or flame to them is liable. By contrast, with regard to <b>an ember, as long as he leaves it</b> alone <b>it progressively dims,</b> and the only way in which it will cause damage is if someone else actively fans it into a flame; therefore, he is not liable.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Rabbi Yoḥanan, who says: Even</b> if the <i>halakha</i> is that if <b>one transferred a flame to</b> one of limited halakhic competence he <b>is exempt,</b> it is possible to say that the case <b>in the corresponding</b> situation <b>here</b> in the first clause of the <i>baraita</i> is stated <b>with regard to an untethered ox or an exposed pit.</b> The Gemara asks: But if so, <b>what is different here</b> in the case of an ox and a pit that causes him to be liable <b>and what is different there</b> in the case of the fire that exempts him from liability? Seemingly, in all these cases the item that was transferred is capable of causing damage in its current form, so he would be expected to be liable.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>There,</b> in the case of fire, ultimately <b>the deaf-mute’s handling [<i>tzevata</i>]</b> of the flame <b>causes</b> the damage, as if it were not for him moving the flame no damage would have been caused. <b>Here,</b> in the case of the ox and the pit, <b>the deaf-mute’s handling</b> of them <b>does not cause</b> the damage. Rather, the damage was caused even though they remained in exactly the same dangerous state in which the one who had transferred them to the deaf-mute did so.

In this case, since he broke the bench by merely leaning upon the others sitting there, it is his force that led to the damage, not his body, and one might have thought that since the weight of the others certainly contributed to the breakage they should share liability.

            "Rav Kahana questions the need for the Torah to teach this: <b>Now, if</b> the one liable for the damage <b>had</b> in his possession the carcasses of <b>several torn animals, he could give</b> the injured party a carcass as payment, <b>as the Master said</b> above (7a): The verse states: <b>“He shall recompense”</b> (Exodus 21:34), <b>to include</b> items <b>worth money, and even bran,</b> a relatively inferior commodity, as valid items with which to pay restitution. <b>Is it necessary</b> for the Torah to teach that he can pay restitution with <b>his,</b> i.e., the injured party’s, animal carcass?

            "The Gemara rejects this: <b>No, everyone</b> agrees that the loss due to <b>the diminishing</b> value <b>of the carcass is</b> sustained <b>by the injured</b> party, since he owns it, <b>and here they disagree concerning</b> who must go to <b>the effort</b> of retrieving the <b>carcass</b> and transporting it to the court to be appraised.",

They read the term “and the carcass” as a second subject of the term “he shall restore.” It therefore indicates that the one liable for the damage must restore the carcass to the injured party by retrieving it.

            "§ The Gemara cites additional <i>halakhot</i> taught by Ulla, citing Rabbi Elazar: When a woman gives birth or miscarries a fetus she is thereby rendered ritually impure (see Leviticus 12:1–5). Even if she delivers only the afterbirth, with no discernible fetus, she is rendered ritually impure due to the possibility that the fetus was dissolved in the afterbirth, and it is therefore considered as though she delivered it (<i>Nidda</i> 24b). The length of the period of impurity depends on the sex of the child. In the case where it is unclear what the sex is, she must observe the longer period of fourteen days (<i>Nidda</i> 29a). At the end of that period she may purify herself by immersing in a ritual bath. <b>And Ulla says</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> If <b>part of</b> the <b>afterbirth [<i>shilya</i>] emerged on the first day</b> of a woman’s miscarriage <b>and part of it</b> emerged <b>on the second day, one counts</b> the period of ritual impurity <b>from the first</b> day.",
            "<b>Rava said to him,</b> to Ulla: <b>What</b> is the rationale for <b>your opinion</b> to begin counting from the first day? It would appear to be based on the following: Ritual impurity is engendered only once the woman has delivered the fetus. This is defined as the emergence of the majority of the fetus or its head. Since in this case the fetus is not discernible, one must consider the possibility that it had already emerged on the first day, and therefore one is required <b>to act stringently</b> and regard her as impure from the first day.",
            "Rava questions the propriety of acting stringently in this case, as it is <b>a stringency that results in a leniency, because</b> if she begins counting from the first day, <b>you will</b> also <b>render her</b> fit to immerse and become <b>pure from</b> fourteen days <b>after the first</b> day. This is a leniency because it is possible that the majority of the fetus emerged only on the second day and therefore her period of impurity began only then. She will therefore remain impure until the fifteenth day.",
            "<b>Rather, Rava said:</b> With regard <b>to being concerned</b> for the possibility that she is impure from the first day, <b>she should be concerned.</b> But with regard to <b>counting</b> the period of impurity, <b>one counts only from the second</b> day.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Ulla <b>teaching us</b> through this <i>halakha</i>? Does he mean to teach us <b>that part of the afterbirth</b> does not emerge <b>without</b> part of the <b>fetus</b> inside? But <b>we</b> already <b>learned</b> that in a mishna (<i>Ḥullin</i> 77a): When an animal is ritually slaughtered, the animal and everything inside it becomes permitted for consumption. This applies to an unborn fetus as well. If prior to the slaughter the majority of the fetus emerged, it is considered to have been born, and therefore the entire fetus, even the part that is still within its mother, is not rendered permitted for consumption by the slaughter. Accordingly, if <b>part of the afterbirth emerged</b> prior to the slaughter, <b>it is prohibited to eat</b> it, because an afterbirth is <b>a sign of a fetus in a woman</b> and <b>a sign of a fetus in an animal.</b>",

Therefore, Ulla <b>teaches us</b> that, in fact, part of the afterbirth does not emerge without part of the fetus inside.",
            "The Gemara cites another <i>halakha</i> taught by Ulla, citing Rabbi Elazar: <b>And Ulla says</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> With regard to a male <b>firstborn</b> child <b>who was mauled</b> by an animal <b>within thirty days</b> of his birth and died, one is <b>not required to redeem him,</b> as the requirement to do so, by paying five <i>sela</i> to a priest, applies only once the child is thirty days old (see Numbers 18:15–16).",

            "The Gemara cites another <i>halakha</i> taught by Ulla, citing Rabbi Elazar: <b>And Ulla says</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> In the case of <b>a bailee who conveyed</b> a deposit that was entrusted to him <b>to</b> another <b>bailee,</b> the first bailee is <b>exempt</b> for any occurrence for which he would have been exempt had he kept the deposit with him. The Gemara adds: <b>And it is not necessary</b> to state this in the case of <b>an unpaid bailee who conveyed</b> a deposit <b>to a paid bailee, thereby increasing</b> the level of <b>its safeguarding,</b> since the paid bailee has a greater level of accountability than an unpaid bailee. <b>Rather,</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> in a case of <b>a paid bailee who conveyed</b> a deposit <b>to an unpaid bailee, thereby decreasing</b> the level of <b>its safeguarding.</b> In this case, the first bailee is <b>exempt</b> for any occurrence for which he would have been exempt had he kept the deposit with him, <b>because he conveyed</b> it <b>to a mentally competent person</b> and thereby fulfilled his responsibility to ensure the deposit is safeguarded.",
            "<b>Rava said:</b> With regard to <b>a bailee who conveyed</b> a deposit <b>to</b> another <b>bailee,</b> the first bailee becomes <b>liable</b> to pay for any loss to the item, even for mishaps for which he would not have been liable had he kept the deposit with him.

Rava rules that the owner is required to accept an oath only from the bailee with whom he entrusted his item, but not from anyone else. Accordingly, since the first bailee was not present when the event occurred, he is unable to attest to what happened, and even if the second bailee takes an oath to that effect, the owner is not expected to accept his oath. Consequently, the first bailee bears full liability for any loss.",
            "The Gemara cites another <i>halakha</i> taught by Ulla, citing Rabbi Elazar: <b>And Ulla says</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says: The <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>one can collect from</b> the debtor <b>the slaves</b> that he owns as payment for a debt.",

Rav Naḥman asked whether this also extends to collecting any slaves the children inherited. Ulla replied: <b>No,</b> a creditor collects a debt by taking slaves only when he collects directly <b>from</b> the debtor himself. Rav Naḥman challenges this: But when the creditor collects <b>from him,</b> he can collect the debt <b>even from the cloak that is upon his shoulders,</b> and therefore he can certainly also collect the debt by taking his slaves, so what is the novelty of this ruling?",

Even though generally only land can be seized from a buyer as payment for the seller’s debt, a slave is considered to have similar status to land in this regard.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this difference?

            "<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that Rav Ika stated a different answer: <b>Rav Ika, son of Rav Ami, said: According to everyone,</b> the legal status of <b>slaves is</b> generally <b>like</b> that of <b>movable property, and</b> therefore, <b>that which is taught</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, that by taking possession of the slaves <b>he does not</b> also <b>acquire</b> the movable property, is <b>properly</b> understood. <b>And that which is taught</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, that in such a case he <b>acquires</b> the movable property, applies to a case in which at the moment the slave was acquired, the movable property was <b>still upon him,</b> e.g., the slave was holding it, and it could therefore be acquired together with the slave. This is because one’s slave is considered like one’s courtyard, and any item that is placed within it is acquired for its owner.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But even if</b> the movable property was <b>still upon him, what of it?</b> Even if one claims a slave is like a courtyard, he <b>is a mobile courtyard, and a mobile courtyard does not acquire</b> items placed upon it. <b>And if you would say</b> that the case is one <b>where the slave is standing</b> at the time of the transaction, that is still insufficient, as <b>didn’t Rava say: Anything that does not acquire when moving</b> also <b>does not acquire</b> when it is <b>standing or sitting.</b> The fact that the slave can move gives him the status of a mobile courtyard, regardless if he is currently moving or not.",
            "The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i> is</b> that <b>where</b> a slave is <b>bound up</b> and is unable to walk, his status is like that of an immobile courtyard, and his master will acquire anything that is placed upon him at that time.",
            "The Gemara presents another contradiction to the first <i>baraita</i> cited above, which explicitly states that one cannot acquire slaves by taking possession of land: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: If <b>he took possession of the land</b> alone, he thereby also <b>acquires</b> the <b>slaves?</b>",
            "The Gemara resolves the contradiction: <b>There,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> just cited, the case is one <b>where</b> the slaves <b>are standing within</b> the borders of the land that was acquired.",
            "The Gemara notes: <b>By inference,</b> the ruling of <b>this</b> first <i>baraita</i>, which states that <b>he does not acquire</b> the slaves, is stated with regard to a case <b>where they are not standing within</b> the borders of the land that was acquired.",
            "<b>This works out well according to that</b> second <b>formulation of</b> that which <b>Rav Ika, son of Rav Ami, said,</b> that the legal status of <b>slaves is like</b> that of <b>movable property. This is</b> the reason <b>that if</b> the slaves <b>are standing within</b> the borders of the land, <b>yes,</b> they are acquired together with the land, but <b>if not, no,</b> they are not acquired. The Gemara assumes that movable property is acquired together with land only if at the time of the acquisition it is placed upon the land.",
            "<b>But according to that</b> first <b>formulation</b> of that which Rav Ika, son of Rav Ami, <b>said, that</b> the legal status of <b>slaves is like</b> that of <b>land, why do I</b> need the slaves to be <b>standing within</b> the borders of the land? As <b>doesn’t Shmuel say:</b> If someone <b>sold him ten fields,</b> located <b>in ten</b> different <b>countries, once he takes possession of one of them, he has acquired all of them?</b> If the legal status of slaves is like that of land, then the same principle should apply to them, and it should be unnecessary for them to be standing within the land’s borders.",
            "The Gemara reconsiders: <b>But</b> even <b>according to your reasoning,</b> one can ask: <b>According to</b> the second <b>formulation of</b> that which Rav Ika, son of Rav Ami, <b>said, that</b> the legal status of <b>slaves is like</b> that of <b>movable property, why do I</b> need the slaves to be <b>standing within</b> the borders of the land?"

            "Don’t <b>we maintain</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that we do not need</b> movable property <b>to be piled up</b> upon the land one acquires in order to acquire the movable property together with it?",
            "<b>Rather, what have you to say?</b> Perforce, <b>movable property that moves around</b> by itself, such as slaves, <b>is different from movable property that does not move around</b> by itself, i.e., inanimate objects. The <i>halakha</i> that movable property does not need to be piled up upon the land applies only to the latter. Accordingly, in order to acquire slaves together with land, they must be standing within its borders.",
            "Given this distinction, one can say that <b>here, also,</b> an entity legally classified as <b>land that moves around,</b> such as a slave, <b>is different from land that does not move around.</b> Accordingly, <b>a slave,</b> which is classified as <b>land that moves around,</b> is not included in Shmuel’s ruling, as in his ruling <b>there,</b> he refers only to acquiring multiple plots of land, which is possible only because the <b>crust [<i>sadna</i>] of the earth is one</b> block, and therefore each field is really only one part of a bigger whole. This rationale does not permit acquiring land and slaves together, as a slave is not attached to the earth and is separate from the land.",

The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances</b> in which the mishna teaches that one is exempt? <b>If we say</b> it is referring to a case <b>where an ox belonging to us,</b> i.e., to a Jew, <b>gored an ownerless ox,</b> it is obvious that the owner bears no liability, as <b>who is claiming</b> damages <b>from him? Rather,</b> it must be referring to a case <b>where an ownerless ox gored an ox belonging to us,</b> and it teaches that the injured party does not have a right to damages.",
            "The Gemara asks: What is the point of this <i>halakha</i>? If the injured party wishes to recover his losses, <b>let him go and take</b> the belligerent ox for himself, since it is currently ownerless. The Gemara explains: The mishna teaches that the injured party does not have any right to the ox, in order to teach that in a case <b>where another</b> person <b>preceded him and acquired it,</b> the injured party has no claim to it.",
            "<b>Ravina said</b> an alternative interpretation of the mishna: The term assigned property serves <b>to exclude</b> a case in which an ox <b>gored and subsequently</b> its owner <b>consecrated</b> it, or where <b>it gored and subsequently</b> its owner <b>declared</b> it <b>ownerless.</b> Since the owners did not own the ox at the time the case was brought before the court, they are exempt from paying. Ravina explains that this is the intention of the mishna: That one is liable only when the property that caused the damage was owned by a responsible party both when it caused the damage and when it was tried. In this case, at the time of the court hearing it was not owned by a responsible party, as it was either consecrated or ownerless.",
            "<b>It is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <i>halakha</i> is that an ox that kills a person is stoned to death. The mishna states (44b) that this does not apply to an ox consecrated to the Temple or an ownerless ox. <b>Moreover, Rabbi Yehuda said: Even</b> if an ox <b>gored and</b> its owner <b>subsequently consecrated</b> it to the Temple, or if an ox <b>gored and</b> its owner <b>subsequently declared</b> it <b>ownerless,</b> the owner <b>is exempt</b> from liability, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And if the ox was wont to gore in time past, <b>and had been forewarned with its owner,</b> and he had not guarded it in, <b>and it killed a man</b> or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and also its owner shall be put to death” (Exodus 21:29). The repetition of the reference to the owner at the beginning and end of the verse indicates that the ox is not stoned <b>unless</b> the ox’s status as the owner’s property at the time of the <b>death</b> of the victim <b>and</b> at the time of the owner’s <b>standing trial is the same,</b> i.e., the ox is owned by a responsible party for both events.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But do we not</b> also <b>require</b> that the ox’s status be the same at the time of the <b>verdict</b>? <b>Isn’t</b> the phrase: <b>“The ox shall be stoned” written with regard to</b> the time of the <b>verdict?</b>",
            "<b>Rather, say</b> that the owner of the ox is exempt <b>unless</b> the ox’s status as the owner’s property at the time of the <b>death</b> of the victim and at the time of the owner’s <b>standing trial and at the verdict is the same,</b> i.e., the ox is owned by a responsible party for all three events.",
            "§ The mishna teaches: One is liable for damage caused in any place <b>except for a domain designated</b> exclusively <b>for</b> the use of <b>the one responsible for the damage.</b> The Gemara explains the reason for this: This is <b>because</b> the one liable for the damage <b>can say to</b> the injured party: <b>What did your ox want in my domain?</b> One does not have to guard his ox from causing damage within his own property, since another person’s animal has no right to be there.",
            "The mishna continues: <b>And</b> one is liable for damage caused in <b>a domain</b> designated for the joint use <b>of the injured</b> party <b>and the one liable for the damage.</b>",
            "The Gemara cites a dispute concerning this case that results in two different ways of interpreting the mishna: <b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Avimi says:</b> With regard to <b>a courtyard</b> designated for <b>the</b> joint use of two <b>partners,</b> either one of them is <b>liable</b> for damage caused by the ox of one partner to the property of the other partner while <b>in it,</b> both <b>for the</b> category of <b>Eating and for the</b> category of <b>Trampling. And</b> accordingly, <b>this is</b> what the mishna <b>is saying:</b> One is liable for damage caused in any place <b>except for a domain designated</b> exclusively <b>for</b> the use of <b>the one responsible for the damage, as</b> he is <b>exempt</b> there; <b>but</b> in <b>a domain</b> designated for the joint use <b>of the injured</b> party <b>and the one responsible for the damage, when he causes damage, the one who is responsible for the damage is obligated</b> to pay damages. The statement in the mishna concerning a domain designated for joint use is the beginning of the following clause and introduces a case in which one is liable for damage.",
            "<b>And Rabbi Elazar says:</b> In a courtyard designated for joint use, one is <b>exempt for</b> one’s ox causing damage to the property of his partner in <b>the</b> category of <b>Eating, and for</b> one’s ox causing damage to the property of his partner in <b>the</b> category of <b>Trampling. And</b> accordingly, <b>this is</b> what the mishna <b>is saying:</b> One is liable for damage caused in any place <b>except for a domain designated</b> exclusively <b>for</b> the use of <b>the one responsible for the damage, and</b> one is <b>also exempt</b> for damage done in <b>a domain</b> designated for the joint use <b>of the injured</b> party <b>and the one liable for the damage.</b> The statement in the mishna about a domain designated for joint use is a continuation of the previous clause and adds an additional case in which one is exempt. <b>And</b> the following clause: <b>When one causes damage, the one liable for the damage is obligated</b> to pay damages, serves <b>to add</b> the fact that one is liable for damage in the framework of the category of <b>Goring,</b> which was not previously mentioned in the mishna.",
            "This interpretation of the concluding clause of the mishna, as a reference to Goring, <b>works out well according to Shmuel,</b> in his dispute with Rav (3b) concerning the meaning of Ox and <i>Maveh</i> in the first mishna of this chapter. According to Shmuel they mean Trampling and Eating, respectively, and Goring has yet to be addressed. <b>But according to Rav, who says:</b> The term ox in the mishna includes damage caused by the ox <b>and all matters</b> involving damaging actions <b>that</b> are completed by <b>an ox,</b> including Goring, Eating, and Trampling, Goring is already addressed in the mishna. <b>What is added</b> by the clause: The <b>one liable for the damage is obligated</b> to pay damages?",
            "The Gemara answers: It serves <b>to add that which the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that elucidates the mishna’s statement. The mishna states: <b>When</b> an animal or item one is responsible to safeguard <b>causes damage, the one liable for the damage</b> caused by insufficiently safeguarding it <b>is obligated</b> to pay payments of restitution for damage. This serves <b>to include</b> the cases of <b>an unpaid bailee, a borrower, a paid bailee, and a renter,</b> in <b>which an animal,</b> e.g., an ox, <b>caused damage</b> while <b>in their possession.</b> If the ox was <b>innocuous,</b> he <b>pays half</b> of <b>the damages, and</b> if it was <b>forewarned,</b> he <b>pays</b> the <b>full damages.</b> If the ox was safely enclosed and a wall <b>broke open at night, or</b> if <b>bandits [<i>listin</i>] broke it open and</b> the ox <b>went out and caused damage,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from liability.",
            "The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master said</b> that the mishna states: <b>When</b> an animal or item one is responsible to safeguard <b>causes damage, the one liable for the damage</b> caused by insufficiently safeguarding it <b>is obligated</b> to pay payments of restitution for damage. This serves <b>to include</b> the cases of <b>an unpaid bailee, a borrower, a paid bailee, and a renter.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances?</b>",
            "<b>If we say</b> that <b>the lender’s ox,</b> which was under the watch of the borrower, <b>injured the borrower’s ox,</b> and the <i>baraita</i> is teaching that the lender is liable to pay the borrower, why is this so? <b>Let</b> the lender <b>say to</b> the borrower: <b>If</b> my ox <b>had injured</b> an ox <b>in the world</b> at large, i.e., someone else’s ox, <b>you,</b> the borrower, <b>would be required to pay,</b> as you were entrusted with safeguarding it. <b>Now that</b> my ox <b>has injured your ox, should I be required to pay?</b>",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the case must be <b>that the borrower’s ox injured the lender’s ox,</b> and the <i>baraita</i> is teaching that the borrower is liable to pay. The Gemara asks: According to this interpretation, the <i>baraita</i> teaches that if the belligerent ox was innocuous, the borrower is liable to pay only half of the damages. But why? <b>Let</b> the lender <b>say to</b> the borrower: By borrowing my ox, you undertook full responsibility for it such that <b>if</b> my ox <b>had been injured</b> by an ox <b>from the world</b> at large, <b>you would be required to pay</b> me <b>for</b> the <b>entire</b> value of my <b>ox,</b> irrespective of whether the belligerent ox was considered innocuous or forewarned. <b>Now that</b> it is <b>your ox that injured</b> my ox, <b>should you</b> have to <b>pay</b> only <b>half</b> of <b>the damages?</b> This interpretation of the <i>baraita</i> is also difficult.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>Actually,</b> the case is <b>where the lender’s ox injured the borrower’s ox, and with what are we dealing here?</b> This is a case <b>where</b> the borrower <b>undertook</b> the responsibility of <b>safeguarding the body of</b> the lender’s ox from being injured,"

            "The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so, say,</b> and try to explain accordingly, <b>the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: If the ox was safely enclosed and a wall <b>broke open at night, or</b> if <b>bandits broke it open and</b> the ox <b>went out and caused damage,</b> the bailee is <b>exempt</b> from liability. The Gemara infers: If it broke open <b>during the day</b> and then caused damage, he is <b>liable.</b> The Gemara asks: According to the interpretation offered in explanation of the previous clause, the <i>baraita</i> concerns a case in which one borrowed an ox but did not undertake the responsibility to prevent it from causing damage. If so, how can the latter clause imply that there are cases in which he is liable? If <b>he did not undertake</b> the responsibility of <b>safeguarding</b> the lender’s ox to prevent it <b>from causing damage,</b> he should never be liable for the damage that it caused.",
            "The Gemara answers that the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i> concerns a different case than that of the previous clause. <b>This</b> is what the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: If,</b> by contrast, the borrower <b>did undertake</b> the responsibility of <b>safeguarding</b> the lender’s ox to prevent it <b>from causing damage,</b> if it causes damage, the borrower is <b>liable.</b> But if the ox was safely enclosed and the wall enclosing it <b>broke open at night, or</b> if <b>bandits broke it open and</b> the ox <b>went out and caused damage,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b>",
            "The Gemara returns to its prior discussion of the mishna’s statement concerning property designated for the joint use of the injured party and the one liable for the damage. The Gemara cited Rabbi Elazar’s opinion that each partner is exempt from liability for any damage that falls within the categories of Trampling or Eating that their ox caused to the other partner’s property. The Gemara challenges his opinion: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rav Yosef teach</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In a courtyard</b> designated for the joint use <b>of partners, or</b> in <b>an inn [<i>pundak</i>],</b> one is <b>liable for Eating and for Trampling</b> caused by an ox of one partner to the property of the other. It would appear that this <i>baraita</i> is <b>a conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar.</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Elazar</b> could have <b>said to you: But</b> how can <b>you understand</b> that this <i>baraita</i> provides a refutation of my opinion? <b>Are there not <i>baraitot</i> that disagree</b> with regard to this issue? <b>And it is taught</b> in accordance with my opinion in a <i>baraita</i> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (1:9): <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar would state four principles with regard to</b> the liability incurred based on where the <b>damage</b> occurs.

If a place is the property <b>of the one liable for the damage and</b> is <b>not</b> the property <b>of the injured</b> party, the owner of an animal that causes damage is <b>exempt for all</b> the damage caused there.",
            "If a place is the property <b>of</b> both <b>this</b> one <b>and that</b> one, <b>e.g., a courtyard</b> designated for the joint use <b>of partners or</b> a field in <b>the valley</b> that is used by the public, the owner of an animal that causes damage is <b>exempt for Eating and for Trampling</b> performed by his animal <b>in</b> that place.

            "If a place where the damage occurs is the property <b>of neither this</b> one <b>nor that</b> one, <b>e.g., a courtyard that is not</b> owned by either <b>of the two of them,</b> the owner of an animal that causes damage is <b>liable for Eating and for Trampling</b> performed by his animal <b>in</b> that place.

            "The Gemara comments: These <i>baraitot</i> <b>are difficult,</b> as they seem to contradict <b>one another.</b>",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>When that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught,</b> it is <b>with regard to</b> a jointly owned <b>courtyard,</b> which under the terms of their partnership is <b>designated for</b> the use of both <b>this</b> one <b>and that</b> one, i.e., as partners, <b>for</b> bringing <b>both produce and oxen</b> there.

Accordingly, <b>with regard to</b> damage of the category of <b>Eating</b> caused by one partner’s ox to the other’s produce, <b>it is</b> equivalent to <b>a courtyard</b> owned exclusively by <b>the injured</b> party, and therefore he is liable.",
            "The Gemara notes: In accordance with this explanation, the language of each of these <i>baraitot</i> is <b>also precise, as it teaches here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> of Rav Yosef, the case of a courtyard that is <b>similar to an inn,</b> where oxen are usually not allowed to be brought, <b>and it teaches there,</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, the case of a courtyard that is <b>similar to</b> a field in the <b>valley,</b> where oxen are usually allowed to enter. <b>Conclude from it</b> that the Gemara’s distinction between the two <i>baraitot</i> is correct.",
            "<b>Rabbi Zeira objects to this</b> interpretation of Rav Yosef’s <i>baraita</i>: <b>Since</b> the courtyard is <b>designated for</b> both of them to keep their <b>produce</b> there, they should not be liable for damage caused by their oxen there, as in order for one to be liable <b>don’t we need</b> a case that fits the depiction of the verse: <b>“And it consumed in a field of another”</b> (Exodus 22:4), <b>and</b> since they both have the right to use the courtyard it <b>does not</b> fulfill this condition.",
            "<b>Abaye said to him: Since it is not designated for</b> them to keep <b>oxen</b> there, that is sufficient <b>for it to be termed “a field of another.”</b>",
            "Given the distinction between the cases discussed in the <i>baraitot</i>, the Gemara reconsiders the dispute between Rav Ḥisda and Rabbi Elazar concerning the mishna’s statement about property whose use is designated for both the injured party and the one liable for the damage. <b>Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina: Let us say</b> that <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the <i>baraitot</i> do not disagree,</b> as they are referring to different cases, so too, the <b><i>amora’im</i>,</b> i.e., Rav Ḥisda and Rabbi Elazar, <b>also do not disagree,</b> as they are similarly referring to these different cases.",
            "Ravina <b>said to him: Yes,</b> that is correct. <b>And</b> even <b>if you say</b> that <b>they disagree,</b> their dispute does not concern every case of a jointly owned courtyard, as the Gemara had assumed; rather, their dispute concerns specifically a courtyard designated for the use of their produce, but not the use of their oxen. And <b>they disagree whether</b> to accept <b>the difficulty</b> raised <b>by Rabbi Zeira,</b> that such a courtyard cannot be considered “a field of another,” <b>or</b> whether <b>to</b> accept <b>the resolution of Abaye,</b> that it can be considered “a field of another.”",
            "§ The Gemara returns to <b>the</b> matter <b>itself</b> and analyzes the <i>baraita</i> in the <i>Tosefta</i> cited above. It states: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar would state four principles with regard to</b> the liability incurred based on where the <b>damage</b> was caused.

            "The Gemara infers: The <i>baraita</i> <b>does not teach:</b> One is liable <b>for any [<i>al hakkol</i>]</b> damage caused there, which would suggest that one is liable for all types of damage. <b>Rather,</b> it teaches: <b>One is liable for all [<i>bakkol</i>]</b> the damage caused, which can be translated as: <b>For</b> the <b>full</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b> This indicates that even were one’s ox considered to be innocuous and caused damage of the category of Goring, which would generally incur liability for half the value of the damage, in this case the owner is liable for the full cost of the damage.",
            "<b>Whose</b> opinion is this? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Tarfon, who says:</b> The <i>halakha</i> of cases of <b>Goring</b> performed by an innocuous animal, which is <b>atypical,</b> done <b>in the courtyard of the injured</b> party, is that the owner of the ox <b>pays</b> the <b>full</b> cost of the <b>damage</b> even if the ox is innocuous.",
            "If this is so, <b>say,</b> and try to explain accordingly, <b>the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: If a place where the damage occurs is the property <b>of neither this</b> one <b>nor that</b> one, <b>e.g., a courtyard that is not</b> owned by either <b>of the two of them,</b> the owner of an animal that causes damage is <b>liable for Eating and for Trampling</b> performed by his animal <b>in</b> that place.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does the <i>baraita</i> mean by saying the property is <b>of neither this</b> one <b>nor that</b> one? <b>If we say</b> the intention of the <i>baraita</i> is that the property is <b>of neither this</b> one <b>nor that</b> one <b>at all,</b> but <b>rather</b> it belongs <b>to another</b> person, why should either partner be liable? <b>But don’t I need</b> a case that fits the depiction of the verse: <b>“And it consumed in a field of another”</b> (Exodus 22:4), which is understood to mean that the consumed produce belongs to the owner of the field in which the act of consumption occurred; <b>and</b> since the injured party does not have any rights to this place it <b>does not</b> fulfill this condition?",
            "<b>Rather, it is obvious</b> that the intention of the <i>baraita</i> is that the property is <b>of neither this</b> one <b>nor that</b> one together; <b>rather,</b> it belongs <b>to</b> only <b>one</b> of them, i.e., the injured party, <b>and the latter clause teaches:</b> If the ox is <b>innocuous,</b> the owner <b>pays half</b> the value of <b>the damage, and</b> if it is <b>forewarned, he pays</b> the <b>full</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b>",
            "If so, in the latter clause <b>we arrive at</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say:</b> The <i>halakha</i> of cases of <b>Goring</b> performed by an innocuous animal, which is <b>atypical,</b> occurring <b>in the courtyard of the injured</b> party, is that the owner of the ox <b>pays half</b> the value of <b>the damage.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: Could it be that <b>the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Tarfon and the last clause is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis?</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> that is <b>as Shmuel said to Rav Yehuda</b> with regard to another mishna (15b): <b><i>Shinnana</i>, leave the mishna and follow after me</b> and my interpretation that <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Tarfon and the last clause is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> In this <i>baraita</i> as well, the different clauses are taught in accordance with different Sages’ opinions.",
            "The Gemara presents a different interpretation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Ravina said in the name of Rava: The entire</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Tarfon, and what</b> does it mean by saying that the property is <b>of neither this</b> one <b>nor that</b> one? The property does <b>not</b> belong both <b>to this</b> one <b>and that</b> one; <b>rather,</b> it is designated <b>for</b> the use of only <b>one</b> of them, <b>for</b> him to keep his <b>produce</b> there.

            "Accordingly, <b>with regard to</b> damage of the category of <b>Eating,</b> the property <b>is</b> considered to be the <b>courtyard of the injured</b> party; therefore, the one responsible for the damage is liable to pay for the damage. By contrast, <b>with regard to</b> damage of the category of <b>Goring,</b> since they both have the right to keep their oxen there, the property <b>is</b> considered to be like <b>a public domain,</b> and therefore even Rabbi Tarfon agrees that if one’s innocuous ox causes damage there one is liable for only half the value of the damage.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> does the <i>baraita</i> list <b>four</b> principles? <b>There are</b> only <b>three.</b> In other words, according to the way Ravina explains the latter clause, i.e., the fourth principle, it does not teach anything that is not already known from the first three principles, as the fact that one is liable for Eating and Trampling in property designated for the use of the injured party is explicitly stated in the first principle, and the fact that one is liable for only half the cost of the damage in a case of Goring in a jointly owned courtyard is expressed in the third principle.",

            "The Gemara explains why the mishna needs to teach this principle twice: <b>One</b> mention is made <b>with regard to an innocuous</b> ox <b>and</b> the other <b>one</b> is made <b>with regard to a forewarned</b> ox.",

Therefore, in cases where these animals had not performed this act of damaging before, and were therefore considered innocuous, the owner is liable for only half the cost of the damage, which is a fine. Since the collection of fines may be imposed only by judges who have been ordained, and ordination is given only in Eretz Yisrael, these payments are not collected in Babylonia.",
            "The Gemara adds: <b>And this matter</b> applies only <b>where</b> they attacked <b>large</b> animals, as it is atypical behavior for them; <b>but where</b> they attacked <b>small</b> animals, since that <b>is their</b> typical <b>manner</b> of behavior, it is classified as Eating, for which the owner pays the full cost of the damage, which is certainly considered monetary restitution.

Rather, say that the discussion concerns a case of <b>a courtyard that stands to be rented out, and the man</b> squatting there would <b>have rented</b> other living quarters. If so, then this is a case where <b>this</b> one <b>derives benefit and that</b> one <b>suffers a loss,</b> and in that case he certainly must make payment. The dilemma was not with regard to either of these circumstances.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to raise the dilemma in the case of <b>a courtyard that does not stand to be rented out, but the man</b> squatting there <b>would have rented</b> other living quarters had he not squatted in this property. <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in this case? Is the squatter legally <b>able to say to</b> the owner of the courtyard: <b>What loss have I caused you,</b> as you would not have rented it out anyway? <b>Or perhaps</b> the owner of the courtyard is legally <b>able to say</b> to the squatter:"
        ],
        [
            "<b>You have derived benefit</b> from my property, as by living there you saved the money you otherwise would have had to pay in order to rent out a different courtyard, and therefore you must pay me for the benefit you derived.",
            "Rami bar Ḥama <b>said to him:</b> This dilemma is not new; rather, <b>it is</b> discussed in <b>the mishna,</b> and the mishna already provided a solution. Rav Ḥisda asked him: To <b>which mishna</b> are you referring? Rami bar Ḥama <b>said to him: After you serve me,</b> I will tell you. Rav Ḥisda <b>took</b> hold of Rami bar Ḥama’s <b>scarf [<i>suderei</i>] and folded it</b>, as an act of service. Rami bar Ḥama then <b>said to him:</b> This is the mishna: <b>If</b> the animal <b>derives benefit,</b> the owner of the animal <b>pays</b> for <b>the benefit that</b> the animal <b>derived.</b> This demonstrates that one who derives benefit must pay for the benefit he derives, even if the injured party is not entitled to payment for his loss.",
            "<b>Rava said: How</b> little does <b>a man who has the assistance of his Lord have to worry or be concerned</b> about the possibility that his opinion may not be accepted, <b>as even though</b> the dilemma that was raised is in fact <b>not similar to</b> the case in <b>the mishna</b> quoted by Rami bar Ḥama, Rav Ḥisda nevertheless <b>accepted it from him. This</b> case in the mishna, about the animal eating produce in the public domain, is where <b>this one derives benefit and that one suffers a loss, and that</b> case of the squatter living in the courtyard, is where <b>this one derives benefit and that one does not suffer a loss.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what does <b>Rami bar Ḥama</b> think? Why does he equate the two cases? The Gemara explains: He holds that if <b>produce</b> is left <b>in the public domain without specification</b> with regard to its ownership, it is assumed that the owner <b>has rendered it ownerless.</b> The owner does not expect to derive benefit from the produce, and therefore when the animal ate it he suffered no loss. Consequently, it is a case where this one derives benefit and that one does not suffer a loss, and it is comparable to the case of the squatter in the courtyard.",
            "The Gemara attempts to cite conclusive evidence from another case: <b>We learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Batra</i> 4b): If <b>one’s</b> fields <b>surround</b> the fields of <b>another on three sides, and he fenced in the first, the second, and the third</b> field, thereby providing protection also to the other man’s field, the court <b>does not obligate</b> the owner of the inner field to share in the costs of the fence, as he can claim that he does not derive benefit from it, since his field remains exposed on the fourth side. The Gemara infers: <b>But</b> this indicates that if his fields surrounded the inner field on all four sides, and the owner of the outer fields fenced the field on the <b>fourth</b> side as well, the court <b>does obligate</b> the owner of the inner field to share in the expenses.",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Conclude from</b> the mishna that where <b>this one derives benefit and that one does not suffer a loss,</b> the one who derives benefit is <b>obligated</b> to pay for that benefit. In this case, the owner of the inner field benefits from the fence while the owner of the outer field does not suffer a loss, because in any event he would have needed to build those fences, and the owner of the inner field is obligated to share in the expense. The Gemara rejects this: It <b>is different there</b> because the owner of the outer field <b>can say to</b> the owner of the inner field: <b>Your</b> field <b>caused me to have to</b> build the fence with <b>a larger circumference</b> than I would have otherwise needed to had your field not been there, and therefore your field caused me an additional expense. This case is therefore similar to those where this one derives benefit and that one suffers a loss.",
            "The Gemara attempts another resolution: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the continuation of that mishna. <b>Rabbi Yosei said: If</b> the owner of <b>the surrounded,</b> i.e., inner, field <b>arose and enclosed the fourth</b> side on his own, the court <b>imposes upon him</b> the obligation to pay his share of <b>all</b> of it, as through his actions he demonstrated that he was interested in having the fence installed. The Gemara infers from this: The <b>reason</b> the court imposes upon him the obligation to pay his share of all of it is because the owner of <b>the surrounded</b> field arose and <b>enclosed</b> the fourth side himself. By inference, had the owner of <b>the surrounding</b> field built the fourth fence, the owner of the inner field would be <b>exempt.</b>",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Conclude from</b> the mishna that where <b>this one derives benefit and that one does not suffer a loss,</b> the one who derives benefit is <b>exempt.</b> The Gemara rejects this: It <b>is different there</b> because the owner of the inner field <b>can say to</b> the owner of the surrounding fields: <b>For me, the protection</b> of a fence <b>worth a dinar would have been sufficient;</b> I did not wish to pay for such an expensive fence.",
            "The Gemara attempts another resolution: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a mishna (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 117a): If <b>a house and its upper story,</b> which belonged <b>to two</b> separate people, <b>collapsed,</b> necessitating that the entire structure be rebuilt, and <b>the owner of the upper story told the owner of the</b> lower story of the <b>house to build</b> the lower story again so that he could rebuild the upper story, but the owner of the lower story <b>does not want to</b> do so, <b>the owner of the upper story may build</b> the lower story of the <b>house and live in it until</b> the owner of the lower story <b>will pay him for his expenses,</b> and only then will he be required to vacate the lower story of the house and build the upper story.",
            "The Gemara infers: It <b>is</b> all of <b>his expenses that the owner of the</b> lower story of the <b>house is obligated to</b> pay <b>him, and</b> he <b>does not</b> subtract from the amount compensation <b>for rent</b> for the time that the owner of the upper story lived in the lower story of the house. <b>Conclude from</b> the mishna that where <b>this one derives benefit and that one does not suffer a loss,</b> the one who derives benefit is <b>exempt,</b> as the owner of the upper story derived benefit from living in the lower story, while the owner of the lower story did not suffer a loss, since he said he did not need it. The Gemara rejects this proof: It <b>is different there because the</b> lower story of the <b>house is subjugated to the upper story,</b> because it also serves as the foundation of the upper story, and therefore the owner of the lower story of the house is obligated to provide lodging to the owner of the upper story in the interim.",
            "The Gemara attempts another resolution. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the continuation of the mishna, in which Rabbi Yehuda disagrees with the first <i>tanna</i> and holds that the owner of the upper story may not reside in the lower story of the house without payment. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> A proof that the owner of the upper story must pay rent is from the <i>halakha</i> that <b>even this</b> one <b>who resides in another’s courtyard without his knowledge must pay him rent.

            "<b>It was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> discussed this matter: <b>Rav Kahana</b> says that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: He need not pay him rent,</b> and <b>Rabbi Abbahu</b> says that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: He must pay him rent.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Pappa said: This</b> statement <b>of Rabbi Abbahu,</b> citing Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>was not stated explicitly; rather,</b> it <b>was stated from an inference</b> that Rabbi Abbahu drew from something that Rabbi Yoḥanan said in a different context. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Me’ila</i> 5:4): If the treasurer of consecrated property <b>took</b> for himself <b>a stone or</b> a cross <b>beam</b> that had been <b>consecrated, he has not</b> violated the prohibition of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property. This is because his act of taking the stone or the beam has not effectively removed it from within the jurisdiction of Temple property, as any item under his control is in the possession of the Temple treasury.",
            "If the treasurer <b>gave it to another</b> as a gift, <b>he</b> has then <b>misused</b> consecrated property, as he removed it from the possession of the Temple and conveyed it into the possession of another.

            "<b>And Shmuel said: And this</b> is the <i>halakha</i> provided <b>that he placed it over the skylight,</b> as were he to have built it into the actual structure of the house, he would have violated the prohibition of misuse with the very act of construction, as by doing so he effects a change in the stone itself. By contrast, when he places the stone in a place from which it is easy to remove it and give it back, then as long as he has not lived beneath it, he has not, as yet, misused consecrated property.",
            "<b>And Rabbi Abbahu sat before Rabbi Yoḥanan and</b> was <b>saying in the name of Shmuel: That is to say, one who resides in another’s courtyard without his knowledge must pay him rent,</b> similar to the treasurer who resides beneath the consecrated beam without detracting from the value of the beam in any way but has nevertheless violated the prohibition of misuse since he has derived personal benefit from it. <b>And</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>remained silent</b> and offered <b>him</b> no reply.",
            "Rabbi Abbahu <b>thought</b> that <b>since he was silent,</b> this must mean <b>he concedes to his</b> conclusion, and therefore, from then on he would cite this opinion in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan. <b>But</b> that is <b>not so.</b> The reason Rabbi Yoḥanan was silent was because <b>he did not pay attention</b> to Rabbi Abbahu and did not bother to contradict his opinion on the issue. In truth Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion is as was reported in his name by Rav Kahana, that a squatter living on someone else’s premises without his permission and without causing him any loss does not need to pay the owner any rent.",
            "The Gemara explains the distinction between that case and the case of the consecrated stone or beam.

Consequently, anyone who derives benefit from consecrated property is in violation of the prohibition of misuse, but it cannot be inferred from this that one who resides in another’s courtyard without his knowledge must pay him rent.",
            "<b>Rabbi Abba bar Zavda sent</b> a message <b>to Mari bar Mar</b> saying: <b>Raise</b> the following <b>dilemma before Rav Huna:</b> Does <b>one who resides in another’s courtyard without his knowledge need to pay him rent or not?

            "<b>Rabba, son of Rav Huna, said to him</b> in response to the question that was asked of his father: <b>So did my father, my Master, say in the name of Rav: He does not need to pay him rent. And</b> he also stated another <i>halakha</i>: <b>One who rents a house from Reuven must pay rent to Shimon.</b> The Gemara is puzzled: <b>Shimon? What does he</b> have to <b>do</b> with this? The Gemara explains: <b>This</b> is what he is <b>saying,</b> i.e., what he means: If it <b>is discovered that the house</b> he rented did not actually belong to Reuven but rather it was <b>Shimon’s,</b> he <b>must pay rent to</b> Shimon.",
            "The Gemara questions this statement: Did Rav Huna state <b>two</b> contradictory <i>halakhot</i>? On the one hand he says that one who resides in a courtyard without the owner’s knowledge does not need to pay rent, but on the other hand he says that if it is discovered that the true owner of a rented house was someone else, and therefore the tenant was living in another’s courtyard without the owner’s knowledge, he is obligated to pay him rent. The Gemara resolves the difficulty: <b>This</b> second <i>halakha</i>, which stated that he is obligated to pay rent, is referring to a courtyard that <b>stands to be rented out,</b> while <b>that</b> <i>halakha</i>, which stated that he is not obligated to pay rent, is referring to a courtyard that <b>does not stand to be rented out.</b>",

What do they</b> have to <b>do</b> with this? The case concerns one who rents a property from the residents of the city, i.e., the house is public property.

            "The Gemara wonders about this: Did he state <b>two</b> contradictory <i>halakhot</i>?

The Gemara answers: The difference <b>between them</b> is with regard to a house that the homeowner <b>uses</b> to store <b>wood and straw.</b> The house is not empty and desolate but there is nobody living in it. According to Rav Yosef’s reasoning, a squatter there would not have to pay rent to the homeowner.",

The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman holds</b> that <b>one who resides in another’s courtyard without his knowledge must pay him rent?</b> The Gemara rejects this: No, there is no proof taken from this case, because it was a unique situation. <b>In that</b> case <b>Carmanians,</b> nomadic tribes, <b>were initially living on</b> the property, <b>and they would pay the orphans a small amount</b> for the use of the land, and when this man built his mansion he removed the Carmanians from there.

            "§ The mishna teaches: Under <b>what</b> circumstances does the owner of the animal <b>pay</b> for <b>the benefit that</b> his animal <b>derived?</b> If the animal ate produce in the public square in the area before the storefronts, the owner of the animal pays for the food from which it benefits. If the animal ate from food placed at the side of the public square, which is not a public thoroughfare, the owner of the animal pays for what it damaged, as the legal status of that area is like that of the property of the injured party. <b>Rav said:</b> When the mishna says that the owner of the animal pays for what it damaged, it is referring to a case <b>where</b> the animal <b>turns</b> its head to reach the food but the animal itself is standing completely inside the public domain and it eats while standing there. <b>And Shmuel said: Even if</b> it is standing in the public domain and it <b>turns</b> its head to eat from food placed at the side of the public square, its owner is <b>also exempt,</b> as the animal itself is in the public domain.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel, how can you find</b> a case in which the owner is <b>liable</b> to pay for all of the damage caused when his animal ate from food placed at the side of the public square, as indicated by the mishna? The Gemara answers: <b>For example,</b> when an animal <b>leaves the</b> public <b>square and goes and stands at the side of the</b> public <b>square,</b> and eats the food stored there. In that case its owner certainly pays for what it damaged, as this area is comparable to the property of the injured party.",

            "Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak <b>raised the objection, and he resolved it</b> by explaining that the case in the mishna is one where a store <b>is located on a corner</b> and it is situated in a way that some of the produce there would be in an animal’s path as it turns the corner, and therefore the animal would not need to turn its head away from the public domain in order to eat the produce.",
            "<b>There are</b> those <b>who state</b> a different explanation of the dispute between Rav and Shmuel. In a case <b>where it turns</b> its head to eat from the sides of the public square, <b>everyone agrees that</b> its owner is <b>liable</b> to pay the full cost of the damage. <b>When they disagree</b> it is with regard to a case <b>where one allocates space from his property,</b> as he does not have a use for it, and he adds this space <b>to the public domain</b> by leaving it accessible for the public to use, and the damage took place in that area. The dispute is about whether the area is categorized as private property or the public domain.",

            "Initially, the Gemara understands Rabbi Yosei’s opinion as also referring to a situation in which the animal eats from the sides of the public square, and since this is so, it seems that the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei is</b> the same as that of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> Rabbi Meir, and the mishna presents their opinions as differing. <b>Rather,</b> it is clear that <b>there is</b> a difference <b>between them</b> with regard to a case in which the animal <b>turns</b> its head to eat. <b>The first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that with regard to an animal that <b>turns</b> its head, the owner of the animal <b>also pays</b> for <b>the benefit that</b> the animal <b>derived, while Rabbi Yosei holds</b> that he <b>pays</b> for that <b>which it damaged.</b>",
            "The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> it is possible to say <b>that everyone</b> agrees about the <i>halakha</i> in the case of an animal that <b>turns</b> its head, <b>either in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav or in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel.

The fire that spread to the neighboring courtyard is not similar to his arrows, and therefore he is exempt.",
            "The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>If that is so,</b> he should be exempt not only with regard to concealed items but also <b>with regard to exposed</b> items that were damaged by the fire, as <b>his arrows are also depleted</b> when the fire spreads and causes damage. If his exemption is due to fact that the damage was caused because the wall that had separated the two courtyards had collapsed, there should be no distinction between exposed and concealed items.",

In such an instance Rabbi Yoḥanan would require, in addition to the costs of the damage itself, payments for pain, medical costs, loss of livelihood, and humiliation, as in any case of personal injury, given that Rabbi Yoḥanan considers Fire to be no different than an arrow he had shot at the injured party.",

To answer Mar Zutra’s question, <b>Ravina said:</b> It is possible for a cow to cause complete destruction by rubbing against a wall, e.g., a cow <b>that</b> completely <b>erases</b> any decorative <b>images</b> that were adorning the wall. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> It is possible for cow to cause complete destruction by soiling produce, e.g., a cow <b>that trods on</b> the produce and crushes it, thereby totally eradicating it. Consequently, the initial question about the status of the cow’s mouth remains.",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>he incited a dog against</b> another person, or if <b>he incited a snake against</b> another person, he is <b>exempt</b> (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 66b). The Gemara clarifies: <b>Who</b> is <b>exempt? The one who incited</b> the dog is <b>exempt, but</b> the <b>owner of</b> the <b>dog</b> is <b>liable.

            "The Gemara answers: The mishna could be understood a different way. <b>Say</b> that <b>even the one who incited</b> the dog is <b>exempt,</b> as the dog is not his property, but the dog owner is also exempt because his dog’s mouth has a legal status similar to that of the dog owner’s courtyard. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the case under discussion is one where the dog <b>extended his canine teeth and scratched the</b> victim, but the victim’s hand was not inside his mouth, and therefore this incident cannot be treated as if it took place in the domain of the owner of the dog.",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution based on the continuation of the above mishna: If <b>one caused the snake to bite</b> a person by bringing the fangs of the snake to the victim’s body, and the snake killed him, <b>Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> the one who instigated the attack <b>liable</b> to receive the death penalty <b>and the Rabbis exempt</b> him.",
            "<b>And Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov says</b> in explanation of the dispute: When you analyze the matter <b>you will find that according to the statement of Rabbi Yehuda, the venom of a snake is</b> deemed to be constantly <b>present between its fangs,</b> and therefore when the snake is made to strike the victim it is not actively engaged in any action. <b>Consequently,</b> the person handling the snake is liable, similar to one who <b>strikes</b> a victim <b>with a sword,</b> while the <b>snake</b> itself is <b>exempt</b> as it has not done anything. And <b>according to the statement of the Rabbis, the venom of a snake</b> is not present between its fangs but rather the snake must <b>secrete</b> it <b>of its own volition.

            "The Gemara asks about this interpretation: <b>From where</b> is it determined <b>that this</b> additional phrase: <b>“And this,”</b> serves <b>to exclude a <i>zava</i> from</b> having her status determined by individual <b>sightings</b> of blood, associating it instead with the number of days on which she experienced bleeding? <b>Say</b> instead that it serves <b>to exclude</b> the <b><i>zav</i> from</b> having his status determined by sightings on separate <b>days,</b> indicating that he will be rendered a <i>zav</i> only if he experienced three discharges on a single day and not on separate days. The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states</b> elsewhere: <b>“And one who has a discharge, whether it be a man or a woman”</b> (Leviticus 15:33). The verse <b>juxtaposes</b> the ritual impurity of <b>a male to</b> that of <b>a female</b> to teach that <b>just as</b> the <b>female’s</b> ritual impurity is caused by sightings on multiple <b>days, so too</b> the ritual impurity of <b>a male</b> can be caused by sightings on multiple <b>days.</b>",

This verse therefore <b>teaches us</b> that this is not so.",
            "<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye:</b> Is the fundamental principle: It is sufficient for the conclusion that emerges from an <i>a fortiori</i> inference to be like its source, actually accepted by all authorities? <b>But</b> there is <b>this <i>tanna</i>, who does not interpret</b> the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with the principle: <b>It is sufficient, even though</b> it is a case where the principle <b>does not refute</b> the <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference completely. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived that the <b>semen of a man who experiences a gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>zav</i>]</b> imparts ritual impurity by someone carrying it as well as by coming into contact with it, just as the actual gonorrhea-like discharge does? <b>It is a logical derivation</b> from an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: <b>Just as</b> spittle, which is <b>ritually pure</b> when coming <b>from</b> a person who is <b>ritually pure,</b> is <b>impure</b> when coming <b>from</b> someone like a <i>zav</i> who is <b>impure, is it not logical that</b> semen, which is <b>impure</b> when coming <b>from</b> someone who is <b>pure, should be impure</b> when coming <b>from</b> someone who is <b>impure?</b>",
            "<b>And</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>brings</b> this derivation and applies it <b>whether</b> discussing ritual impurity imparted <b>by contact</b> or <b>whether</b> discussing impurity imparted <b>by carrying. And why</b> is this the case? <b>Let us say: The <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>is effective in</b> teaching that the semen of a <i>zav</i> imparts ritual impurity <b>by contact</b> alone, as is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the semen of a pure man, and the principle: <b>It is sufficient, is effective</b> by limiting the scope of the <i>a fortiori</i> inference <b>to exclude</b> the semen of a <i>zav</i> from imparting ritual impurity <b>by carrying.</b> Since the <i>tanna</i> does not formulate his derivation in this manner, it appears that he rejects the principle: It is sufficient, in all situations.",
            "<b>And if you would say</b> that the <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>was not necessary</b> to teach that the seminal emission of the <i>zav</i> imparts ritual impurity <b>by contact, as it is</b> certainly <b>no less</b> impure <b>than</b> if it had come from <b>a man</b> who was <b>pure,</b> so the inference was necessary only to teach that the semen of a <i>zav</i> imparts impurity by carrying, this is not correct. In fact, it <b>was necessary</b> to teach this point, as it may <b>enter your mind to say</b> that since <b>it is written</b> in the verse: “If there be among you any man that is not clean because of something that <b>happens to him by night”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:11), this means that a seminal emission is ritually impure if it came from <b>someone who</b> had something <b>happen to him,</b> and this <b>causes him</b> to experience the emission, but the verse is <b>excluding this</b> <i>zav</i>, who did <b>not</b> have something <b>happen to him</b> to <b>cause him</b> to experience the emission, but <b>rather another matter,</b> i.e., his gonorrhea-like condition, <b>caused him</b> to experience the emission. Consequently, it <b>teaches us</b> that this is incorrect.",
            "Abaye responded: In the verse “something that happens to him by night,” <b>is it</b> also <b>written: But not another matter?</b> This limiting clause is not written in the verse, and therefore the <i>halakha</i> that the semen of a <i>zav</i> imparts ritual impurity by contact can be understood from the explicit verse in the Torah, and there is no need to derive it from an <i>a fortiori</i> inference. Therefore, the only function of the <i>a fortiori</i> inference is to teach the halakha that the semen of a <i>zav</i> imparts impurity by carrying. Applying the principle: It is sufficient, would refute the <i>a fortiori</i> inference completely, so there is no proof that the <i>tanna</i> would apply the principle in all circumstances.",
            "Once the Gemara raised the issue, it clarifies: <b>And who is the <i>tanna</i></b> about whom <b>you heard that he said: Semen of a <i>zav</i> imparts ritual impurity by carrying?</b> It was <b>not Rabbi Eliezer and not Rabbi Yehoshua. As we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Semen of a <i>zav</i> imparts ritual impurity by contact but</b> it <b>does not impart ritual impurity by carrying;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer.

            "<b>Rabbi Yehoshua says there</b> that the semen of a <i>zav</i> imparts ritual impurity by carrying <b>only because it is impossible</b> for semen to emerge <b>without small drops of <i>ziva</i></b> accompanying it. This indicates that <b>if not for this</b> reason, the semen would <b>not</b> impart ritual impurity by carrying, according to the opinions of both Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Eliezer. The Gemara explains: <b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>this <i>tanna</i> is</b> the one who holds the opinion that the semen of a <i>zav</i> imparts ritual impurity by carrying, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna listing the sources of ritual impurity (<i>Kelim</i> 1:3): <b>Of a greater degree than</b> the ritual impurities listed previously in the mishna, i.e., the impurity of a creeping animal, semen, and one who contracted ritual impurity from a corpse,"

            "The Gemara questions this assertion: <b>But perhaps</b> here too the reason for the severity of ritual impurity of the semen is <b>indeed because it is impossible</b> for it to emerge <b>without small drops of <i>ziva</i></b> accompanying it, but it is not due to the impurity of the semen itself. The Gemara rejects this opinion: <b>If</b> that would be <b>so, let</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>teach it</b> in the list of bodily fluids <b>along with,</b> meaning list it immediately following, <b>his <i>ziva</i>.

            "The Gemara returns to the primary discussion concerning the principle: It is sufficient for the conclusion that emerges from an <i>a fortiori</i> inference to be like its source. <b>Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina: But</b> there is <b>this <i>tanna</i></b> who <b>does not apply</b> the principle: <b>It is sufficient,</b> at all, <b>even though</b> such application would <b>not refute</b> the entire <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived that a thick <b>mat</b> can contract ritual impurity <b>from a corpse?

            "<b>And</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>cites this</b> <i>a fortiori</i> inference <b>both</b> to derive the <i>halakha</i> that the mat becomes ritually impure <b>with impurity</b> that lasts until <b>nightfall,</b> as it would if it were to come into contact with a <i>zav</i>, <b>and</b> to derive that the mat becomes ritually impure <b>with impurity</b> that lasts for <b>seven</b> days, as would any vessel that contracted ritual impurity from a corpse. <b>And why</b> does he do so? <b>Say</b> instead that the <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>is effective</b> in deriving the <i>halakha</i> that the mat can contract ritual impurity from a corpse, but only <b>with regard to</b> rendering it <b>impure until nightfall,</b> and also say that the principle: <b>It is sufficient, is effective</b> by limiting the scope of the <i>a fortiori</i> inference <b>to exclude</b> the possibility that the mat would be rendered <b>impure for seven</b> days.",
            "Ravina <b>said to</b> Rav Aḥa: This question <b>was already raised</b> by <b>Rav Naḥman bar Zekharya to Abaye, and Abaye said to him</b> in response: This <b><i>tanna</i></b> does not derive the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the mat through an <i>a fortiori</i> inference from the case of a <i>zav</i>. Rather, he <b>derives it from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a mat</b> that came into contact <b>with</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal, and this is</b> what <b>he is saying:</b> The first derivation is as follows: <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>a mat</b> is susceptible to impurity imparted <b>by</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal? And it is a logical derivation</b> based on an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: <b>And just as small vessels, which</b> remain <b>pure</b> despite contact <b>with a <i>zav</i>,</b> nevertheless become <b>impure from</b> contact with the carcass of <b>a creeping animal, is it not right that a mat, which</b> becomes <b>impure from the impurity of a <i>zav</i>, will</b> likewise become <b>impure from</b> contact with the carcass of <b>a creeping animal?</b>",
            "The second derivation is as follows: <b>But from where</b> is it derived that <b>a mat</b> contracts impurity <b>from a corpse?</b> It is derived through a verbal analogy. <b>With regard to</b> impurity imparted by the carcass of <b>a creeping animal, it is stated:</b> “Or <b>a garment or leather”</b> (Leviticus 11:32), <b>and with regard to</b> impurity imparted by <b>a corpse it is stated: “A garment, or</b> anything made of <b>leather”</b> (Numbers 31:20). <b>Just as</b> with regard to the terms <b>“garment” and “leather” stated with regard to a creeping animal, a mat</b> becomes <b>impure from it, so too</b> with regard to the terms <b>“garment” and “leather” stated with regard to a corpse, a mat</b> becomes <b>impure from it.</b>",
            "The Gemara notes: It must be that the words “garment” and “leather” are <b>free,</b> i.e., those terms must be extraneous in their contexts, and the Torah included them for the express purpose of establishing the verbal analogy, as a verbal analogy that is based on otherwise extraneous terms cannot be logically refuted. <b>Because if</b> these terms are <b>not free,</b> the verbal analogy <b>can be refuted: What</b> is unique <b>about a creeping animal?</b> It is unique in <b>that</b> it <b>renders</b> items <b>impure</b> even <b>by means of</b> contact with <b>a lentil-bulk</b> of a creeping animal. <b>Shall you</b> also <b>say</b> that this is the case <b>with regard to a corpse,</b> whose <i>halakhot</i> are less strict <b>in that</b> it <b>does not render</b> items <b>impure by means of</b> contact with <b>a lentil-bulk</b> of a corpse but <b>rather by means of</b> contact with <b>an olive-bulk?</b> Unless the terms are free, the analogy can be refuted.",
            "The Gemara affirms: <b>Indeed,</b> the terms <b>are free.</b> The Gemara proves that the terms “garment” and “leather” are extraneous in their context. <b>Now, since</b> ritual impurity imparted by contact with <b>a creeping animal is juxtaposed to</b> ritual impurity imparted by contact with <b>semen, as it is written:</b> “And one who comes into contact with anyone impure with impurity imparted by a corpse, <b>or a man from whom</b> semen <b>is emitted”</b> (Leviticus 22:4), <b>and juxtaposed to that</b> verse is the verse: <b>“Or a man who touches any creeping animal</b> which makes him impure, or a person who may make him impure with any impurity that he has” (Leviticus 22:5); <b>and it is written with regard to</b> the impurity of <b>semen: “And every garment and all leather that has semen on it</b> shall be washed with water and will be impure until evening” (Leviticus 15:17), since the verses appear next to each other, the <i>halakhot</i> of each can be derived from the other.",
            "Consequently, <b>why do I</b> need the words <b>“garment” and “leather” that the Merciful One wrote with regard to a creeping animal?</b> The relevant <i>halakha</i> could be derived from the <i>halakhot</i> of seminal impurity. Consequently, <b>learn from it</b> that “garment” and “leather” were mentioned <b>to render them free,</b> i.e., extraneous, but the Torah included them for the express purpose of establishing the verbal analogy.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>And still,</b> the terms “garment” and “leather” <b>are free</b> only <b>from one side</b> of the verbal analogy, because although the terms “garment” and “leather,” stated with regard to ritual impurity imparted by a creeping animal, are extraneous in their context, as the relevant <i>halakha</i> could have been derived in another manner, those terms stated with regard to impurity imparted by a corpse are not extraneous in their context. <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that with regard to a verbal analogy that is <b>free from</b> only <b>one side, one can derive from it and</b> one <b>cannot refute</b> it logically; <b>it is well. But according to the one who says</b> that <b>one can derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> a verbal analogy of this kind <b>and</b> one <b>can</b> also <b>refute</b> it logically, <b>what can be said?</b> It has already been established that the carcass of a creeping animal is stricter in some senses than a corpse.",
            "The Gemara answers: The terms “garment” and “leather,” as stated <b>with regard to</b> impurity imparted by <b>a corpse, are also free. Since</b> the impurity of <b>a corpse is juxtaposed with</b> that of <b>semen, as it is written: “And one who comes into contact with anyone impure with impurity imparted by a corpse, or a man from whom</b> semen <b>is emitted”</b> (Leviticus 22:4), <b>and it is written with regard to semen: “And every garment and all leather that has semen on it”</b> (Leviticus 15:17), <b>why do I</b> need the terms <b>“garment” and “leather” that the Merciful One wrote with regard to</b> impurity imparted by <b>a corpse? Learn from it</b> that they are mentioned in order <b>to render them free, and</b> therefore <b>it is free from both sides.</b>",
            "The Gemara questions this from a different angle: <b>This works out well according to the one who says: Infer</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>from it and interpret it according to its</b> new <b>place.</b> This would mean that the <i>halakha</i> that a mat becomes impure from a corpse is derived from the <i>halakha</i> that a mat becomes impure from semen, but the details of that impurity, i.e., the length of the time it is impure, are interpreted according to the <i>halakhot</i> of impurity imparted by a corpse, for seven days. <b>But according to the one who says: Infer</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>from it and</b> infer the details of the <i>halakha</i> <b>from it</b> as well, which would mean that the details of the impurity would also be interpreted according to the <i>halakhot</i> of impurity imparted by semen, <b>what can be said?</b> According to the latter opinion, it should be concluded that just as the impurity imparted to a mat by the carcass of a creeping animal lasts only until nightfall, so too, a mat rendered impure by a corpse remains impure only until nightfall.",
            "In response to this, <b>Rava said:</b> This opinion does not lead to that conclusion, as there is a Torah edict indicating otherwise. <b>The verse states</b> (Numbers 31:24): <b>“And you shall wash your garments on the seventh day.”</b> This teaches that <b>any ritually impure</b> items <b>that you render impure</b> due to contact <b>with a corpse must</b> remain impure for a period of <b>no less than seven</b> days. Therefore, since it has been inferred that the mat is susceptible to the impurity imparted by a corpse, it automatically falls into the same category of other items similarly rendered impure by a corpse and must remain impure for a period of at least seven days.",
            "§ Up to this point, the Gemara discussed how to properly apply the principle: It is sufficient for the conclusion that emerges from an <i>a fortiori</i> inference to be like its source.

            "The Gemara rejects this: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to Eating or Trampling (Exodus 22:4): <b>“And it consumed in the field of another,”</b> meaning that one’s liability for this form of damage is limited to damage caused on the property of the injured party, but <b>not</b> for damage caused <b>in the public domain.</b>"

            "The Gemara rejects this as well: This is also incorrect, as <b>the verse states</b> with regard to the payment of half the damages: <b>“And divide its monetary value”</b> (Exodus 21:35). The use of the expression “its monetary value,” and not “the monetary value,” emphasizes that it is specifically <b>the price of this</b> ox that caused damage classified as Goring whose money will be divided, i.e., the owner of the ox will be obligated to pay half the cost of the damage, <b>but not the price of another,</b> i.e., not in other cases of damage caused by one’s ox.",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so, say the latter clause</b> of that <i>baraita</i>: If, instead of removing his own ox, the owner of the ox on the bottom <b>pushed the one on top and it died,</b> he is <b>liable.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>One</b> <i>halakha</i> was stated with regard to a case where this occurred <b>in the summer,</b> the dry season, <b>and one</b> with regard to a case where it occurred <b>in the rainy season.</b>",

            "<b>Rather,</b> Rava’s explanation, that Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda disagree with regard to a case where the carcass depreciated in value, should be rejected.

            "<b>Ravina</b> himself <b>said</b> a different explanation of the <i>baraita</i>: The practical difference <b>between</b> Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Ya’akov <b>is</b> with regard to whether a change of <b>custody changes</b> the status of the ox. <b>For example,</b> in a case where the ox <b>was forewarned</b> while in the custody of the steward <b>and</b> subsequently <b>the deaf-mute regained his hearing, or the imbecile became</b> halakhically <b>competent, or the minor reached majority,</b> and the ox returned to its owner’s custody. <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that <b>it is</b> still <b>in its</b> previous <b>status,</b> the change of custody notwithstanding, and that therefore the owner is liable for the full cost of the damage. By contrast, <b>Rabbi Ya’akov holds</b> that the change of <b>custody changes</b> the status of the ox, which reverts to innocuousness, and so the owner pays only half the cost of the damage.",
            "§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Stewards</b> are liable to <b>pay from</b> their <b>superior-quality</b> property for damage caused by forewarned oxen under their custody, <b>but they do not pay a ransom</b> if the oxen killed a person.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> that the purpose of <b>ransom</b> is <b>atonement</b> for the owner of the ox, <b>and</b> that therefore a minor orphan’s steward is exempt from liability to pay it, as <b>orphans are not subject to</b> the obligation of <b>atonement</b> since they are not morally responsible?",
            "<b>Rav Ḥisda said: It is Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse: “If a ransom is imposed upon him, <b>then he shall give for the redemption of his life”</b> (Exodus 21:30), is referring to the monetary <b>value of the injured</b> party. <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says:</b> The ransom corresponds to the monetary <b>value of the one liable for the damage.</b>",
            "<b>What, do they not disagree with regard to this</b> very issue? In other words, <b>the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>ransom is monetary restitution</b> for the damage caused, and therefore the heirs of the victim must be paid the monetary value of the victim. <b>And Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, holds</b> that <b>ransom</b> is <b>atonement</b> for causing the death of a person. Accordingly, the amount of the ransom is the monetary value of the one liable, since, from the perspective of his moral responsibility for the incident, he deserves to pay with his life. Although the court does not impose capital punishment, his atonement is through payment of his own value.",
            "<b>Rav Pappa said: No,</b> it is possible <b>that</b> according to <b>everyone ransom is atonement, and here they disagree with regard to this</b> issue: <b>The Rabbis hold</b> that <b>we evaluate</b> the amount that is appropriate for atonement <b>according to</b> the monetary value <b>of the injured</b> party, <b>and Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, holds</b> that <b>we evaluate</b> it <b>according to</b> the value <b>of the one liable for the damage.</b> All agree that the purpose of the ransom is atonement.",
            "The Gemara elaborates: <b>What is the reasoning of the Rabbis? Imposing is stated</b> in the <b>later</b> verse: “If ransom is imposed upon him” (Exodus 21:30), <b>and imposing is stated</b> in the <b>earlier</b> verse, concerning a person who injures a pregnant woman, causing her to miscarry: “He shall be punished as the husband of the woman shall impose upon him” (Exodus 21:22). This verbal analogy indicates comparison of the two <i>halakhot</i>: <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to compensation for causing miscarriage, the evaluation is <b>according to</b> the monetary value <b>of the injured</b> party<b>,</b> i.e., the fetus, <b>so too here,</b> the ransom is <b>according to</b> the value <b>of the injured</b> party.",
            "<b>And Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, holds</b> that the fact that <b>it is written: “And he shall give for the redemption of his life,”</b> indicates that the ransom is redemption of the life of the ox’s owner, and its amount should accordingly be the owner’s monetary value.",
            "<b>And the Rabbis</b> would respond to this reasoning that <b>indeed,</b> the phrase: <b>“For the redemption of his life,” is written,</b> indicating that the purpose of the ransom is redemption of his life. <b>Nevertheless, when we evaluate</b> the amount he is liable to pay, <b>we evaluate</b> it <b>according to</b> the value <b>of the injured</b> party.",
            "§ <b>Rava was praising Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov before Rav Naḥman,</b> saying <b>that he is a great man.</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: When he</b> happens to <b>come to you, bring him to</b> visit <b>me.</b>",
            "<b>When</b> Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov eventually <b>came to him,</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: Ask me something.</b> Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov <b>asked him:</b> If <b>an ox belonging to two partners</b> kills a person, <b>how do they pay</b> the <b>ransom?</b>",
            "If <b>this</b> partner <b>pays</b> the <b>ransom</b> in full <b>and that</b> partner also pays the <b>ransom</b> in full, it would seem incorrect, as <b>the Merciful One states</b> that <b>one ransom</b> shall be paid, <b>but not two ransoms.</b> If <b>this</b> partner pays <b>half</b> the <b>ransom and that</b> partner pays <b>half</b> the <b>ransom,</b> it would also seem incorrect, as <b>the Merciful One states</b> that <b>a full ransom</b> shall be paid, <b>but not half a ransom.</b>",
            "<b>While</b> Rav Naḥman <b>was sitting and pondering this</b> question, Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov asked him another question. <b>He said to him: We learned</b> in a mishna: The court <b>repossesses</b> property <b>from those liable</b> to pay their <b>valuations</b> who are delaying their payments. But the court <b>does not repossess</b> property <b>from those liable</b> to bring <b>sin-offerings and guilt-offerings;</b> they are relied upon to bring their offerings of their own initiative, as it is assumed they want to atone for their transgressions (<i>Arakhin</i> 21a). In light of this mishna, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>those liable</b> to pay <b>ransom?</b>",
            "Should it be reasoned that <b>since it is atonement, it is similar to</b> the cases of <b>a sin-offering and a guilt-offering,</b> which a person <b>treats seriously,</b> as it is in his interest to achieve atonement, <b>and</b> therefore the court <b>does not need to repossess</b> property <b>from him? Or perhaps</b> it should be reasoned that <b>since he is required to give</b> the ransom <b>to another</b> person, he considers <b>it a financial</b> liability <b>and</b> does <b>not</b> consider <b>it</b> an obligation <b>toward the Most High, and</b> consequently he <b>does not treat it seriously</b> enough; <b>and</b> therefore the court <b>needs to repossess</b> property <b>from him,</b> as he might not pay it.",
            "<b>Alternatively,</b> it could be reasoned that <b>since he</b> himself <b>did not sin but</b> rather <b>it is his property,</b> i.e., his ox, <b>that caused the damage, he does not treat the matter seriously</b> enough, <b>and</b> therefore the court <b>needs to repossess</b> property <b>from him</b> to ensure payment.",
            "Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: Leave me alone. I am</b> still <b>stuck on the first</b> question and have no solution, so you must not raise further difficult questions.",
            "<b>The Sages taught:</b> Even though one who borrows an ox from another is generally responsible for damage that it causes, <b>if he borrowed it on the presumption</b> that it was <b>innocuous</b> and it gored and caused damage, <b>and it was</b> then <b>found</b> to be <b>forewarned, the owner pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage and the borrower pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage.</b>",
            "If the ox <b>was rendered forewarned in the house of the borrower,</b> i.e., it gored three times while in his possession, and he was warned in court, <b>and he</b> then <b>returned it to the owner</b> and it subsequently gored, <b>the owner pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage,</b> as with regard to him it is still considered innocuous, having become forewarned while not in his custody, <b>and the borrower is exempt from</b> paying <b>any</b> compensation, since the ox is no longer in his custody.",

            "The Gemara answers that the borrower is liable <b>because</b> the owner <b>can say to him: Ultimately,</b> even <b>if it was innocuous, you would be required to pay half the damages.</b> Therefore, <b>now too, go pay half the damages.</b>",

            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where the court seized</b> the ox <b>first,</b> before the borrower had the chance to admit his liability or to smuggle the ox to the marsh. Therefore, the borrower cannot claim that he would have been able to render himself exempt from liability.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so, why does the owner pay half</b> the cost of <b>the damage?

            "The Gemara rejects this claim: <b>No,</b> this cannot be derived by logic alone. <b>If you say</b> that <b>a person</b> who kills <b>a person</b> is liable even when the victim is a minor, this may be due to the extra severity in the case of a human assailant, <b>as he is liable to</b> pay <b>four types of indemnity</b> for causing injury; pain, humiliation, medical costs, and loss of livelihood, in addition to payment for the actual damage. <b>Shall you</b> also <b>say</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to an ox, whose</b> owner <b>is not liable to</b> pay these <b>four types of indemnity?</b> Clearly, this <i>halakha</i> cannot be derived merely through logical comparison between the two cases. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Whether it has gored a son or has gored a daughter,” to render</b> it <b>liable for minors</b> as well <b>as adults.</b>",
            "<b>And I have</b> derived this <i>halakha</i> <b>only with regard to forewarned</b> oxen; <b>from where</b> do I derive that <b>in</b> the case of <b>an innocuous</b> ox, it is killed if it kills a boy or a girl?",
            "The <i>baraita</i> asks: Could this not be derived through <b>logical inference? Since</b> the Torah <b>renders</b> an ox <b>liable</b> to be killed <b>for</b> killing <b>a man or a woman, and</b> likewise <b>renders</b> it <b>liable</b> to be killed <b>for</b> killing <b>a boy or a girl;</b> then <b>just as when it renders</b> it <b>liable</b> to be killed <b>for</b> killing <b>a man or a woman you do not differentiate between an innocuous</b> ox <b>and a forewarned</b> ox, as both are stoned, <b>so too, when it renders</b> an ox <b>liable</b> to be killed <b>for</b> killing <b>a boy or a girl do not differentiate between an innocuous</b> ox <b>and a forewarned</b> ox.",
            "<b>And furthermore,</b> it can be inferred <b><i>a fortiori</i>: If</b> with regard to <b>a man or a woman, whose power is diminished with regard to damages</b> because adults who cause damage are liable to pay, but nevertheless <b>you do not differentiate between an innocuous</b> ox <b>and a forewarned</b> ox that kills them; then with regard to <b>a boy or girl, whose power is enhanced with regard to damages</b> because they are not liable to pay for damage they cause, <b>is it not logical that you should not differentiate between an innocuous</b> ox <b>and a forewarned</b> ox that kills them?",
            "The <i>baraita</i> answers that <b>you could say</b> in response: <b>But does one derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a lenient</b> matter <b>from a stringent</b> matter <b>in order to</b> be more <b>stringent with regard to it? If</b> the Torah <b>is stringent with regard to</b> the case of <b>a forewarned</b> ox, <b>which is a stringent</b> matter, rendering it liable to be killed for killing a minor, does that mean that <b>you should be stringent with regard to an innocuous</b> ox, <b>which is</b> a relatively <b>lenient</b> matter?",
            "<b>And furthermore,</b> there is another reason to reject the earlier opinion: <b>If you say</b> that an innocuous ox is liable to be killed <b>for</b> killing <b>a man or a woman, as they are obligated to</b> observe the <b>mitzvot,</b> which gives them importance, does that mean that <b>you should say</b> the same <b>with regard to a boy or a girl, who are exempt from the mitzvot?</b>",
            "Since this <i>halakha</i> could not have been derived through logic alone, <b>the verse states: “Whether it has gored a son or has gored a daughter,”</b> stating the phrase “has gored” twice, to teach that it is referring both to the <b>goring of an innocuous</b> ox and to the <b>goring of a forewarned</b> ox, and both to <b>goring</b> that causes <b>death</b> and to <b>goring</b> that causes <b>injury.</b> In all these cases the owner of the ox is liable even if the ox gores a minor.",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> if it was forewarned with regard to this behavior, it clearly intended to kill the person and <b>is</b> therefore <b>subject to</b> being put to <b>death,</b> contrary to the ruling in the mishna.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>Here also</b> the case is <b>where it rubbed against the wall for its pleasure</b> and not in order to kill.

Ransom is not imposed for such indirect killing. <b>Rav Mari, son of Rav Kahana, said:</b> It is a case <b>where</b> the wall <b>gradually gave way</b> under the pressure applied by the ox, and so while the ox was still pushing the wall it collapsed and killed the person.",
            "<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel, and</b> this <i>baraita</i> is <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rav: There are</b> cases where the ox is <b>liable to</b> be put to <b>death and</b> the owner is liable <b>to</b> pay <b>ransom, and there are</b> cases where the owner is <b>liable to</b> pay <b>ransom but</b> the ox is <b>exempt from</b> being put to <b>death, and there are</b> cases where the ox is <b>liable to</b> be put to <b>death but</b> the owner is <b>exempt from</b> paying <b>ransom, and there are</b> cases where they are <b>exempt from this</b> punishment <b>and from that</b> one.",

The <i>baraita</i> states explicitly that although a forewarned ox that kills a person unintentionally is exempt from being put to death, its owner is liable to pay ransom, in accordance with Shmuel’s opinion, and in contrast with Rav’s opinion.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>And</b> for <b>injuries</b> caused by an ox <b>unintentionally,</b> from which the victim is not killed, <b>Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> the owner <b>liable</b> to pay for the injury <b>and Rabbi Shimon exempts</b> him.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to injury caused by the ox <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>its</b> owner’s <b>ransom</b> payment. <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>its</b> owner’s <b>ransom</b> payment he is <b>liable</b> even if the ox gores <b>unintentionally, so too,</b> with regard to <b>injuries</b> he is <b>also liable</b> even if it gores <b>unintentionally.</b>",

            "The Gemara questions the above explanation: <b>And let Rabbi Yehuda also derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning an ox unintentionally causing injury <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>its</b> being put to <b>death.</b> The Gemara answers: In his opinion, <b>we can derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>payment</b> for injury <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of ransom, which is another <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>payment.

            "Conversely, the Gemara asks: <b>And let Rabbi Shimon also derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> here <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>its</b> owner’s <b>ransom</b> payment.

Therefore, the <i>halakha</i> concerning injury cannot be derived from the <i>halakha</i> of ransom, as they are dissimilar.",
            "§ The mishna teaches that if an ox <b>intended to kill</b> another <b>animal but killed a person,</b> or if it intended to kill a person for whom it would not be liable to be put to death but killed a person for whom it would be liable, it is <b>exempt.</b> The Gemara infers: If the ox <b>intended to kill this</b> person, for whom it would be liable, <b>but killed that</b> person instead, it is still <b>liable.</b> Accordingly, <b>the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Even</b> if the ox <b>intended to kill this</b> person <b>but killed that</b> person, it is <b>exempt.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon?</b> The Gemara answers that it is <b>because the verse states: “The ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death”</b> (Exodus 21:29); the juxtaposition of the ox and its owner indicates that <b>as the death of the owner,</b> i.e., a person, for killing another person, <b>so</b> is <b>the death of the ox</b> for killing a person. In other words, the two <i>halakhot</i> are applied in the same circumstances. Specifically, <b>just as the owner,</b> i.e., a person, is not liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment <b>unless he intends</b> to kill the person whom he ultimately kills, <b>so too, an ox</b> is not put to death <b>either, unless it intends</b> to kill the one whom it ultimately kills.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the owner himself, from where do we</b> derive that he is not liable unless he killed the one whom he intended to kill? It is <b>as the verse states: “And he lay in wait for him, and rose against him,</b> and struck him mortally and he died” (Deuteronomy 19:11). From the term “for him,” Rabbi Shimon derives that the killer is not liable <b>unless he intends</b> to kill <b>him,</b> i.e., the one whom he ultimately killed.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And what do the Rabbis,</b> who deem the killer liable in that case and who therefore disagree with Rabbi Shimon’s opinion, <b>do with this</b> phrase: <b>“And he lay in wait for him”?</b> How do they interpret it? The Gemara answers that the Sages <b>of the school of Rabbi Yannai say</b> that this phrase <b>excludes</b> from liability <b>one who throws a stone into</b> an area where there are several people, some of whom are people for whom he would not be liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment, e.g., gentiles, and a stone killed a person for whom he would receive court-imposed capital punishment.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>If we say that there are nine gentiles</b> in the crowd <b>and one Jew among them,</b> even without the verse <b>derive</b> the exemption from the fact <b>that a majority of them are gentiles. Alternatively,</b> even if <b>half</b> the people are gentiles <b>and half</b> are Jews, derive the exemption from the principle that when there is <b>uncertainty</b> concerning <b>capital law,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>to</b> be <b>lenient.</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the verse <b>is necessary</b> in a case <b>where there are nine Jews and one gentile. Although a majority of them are Jews,</b> the thrower is exempt from liability <b>because there is one gentile among them</b> who <b>is considered fixed</b> in his place, <b>and</b> the legal status of <b>any</b> item <b>fixed</b> in its place <b>is like</b> that of an uncertainty that is <b>equally balanced; and</b> when there is <b>uncertainty</b> concerning <b>capital law</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>to</b> be <b>lenient.</b> This is what the Rabbis derive from the phrase: “And he lay in wait for him.”",

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> In the passage discussing an ox that kills a person (Exodus 21:28–32), the Torah states: <b>“An ox,” “an ox,”</b> repeating this word <b>seven</b> times, <b>to include</b> an additional six cases, in addition to the classic case of an ox goring and killing a person.

            "The Gemara infers: <b>The reason that the owner of the courtyard</b> is <b>liable and the owner of the ox</b> is <b>exempt</b> is specifically <b>that</b> the homeowner <b>said to</b> the owner of the ox: <b>And I will safeguard it.</b> One can infer that if the owner of the courtyard granted permission for the ox to enter <b>without specifying</b> that the owner of the animal safeguard it, <b>the owner of the ox</b> is <b>liable</b> if it damages the property of the owner of the courtyard, <b>and the owner of the courtyard</b> is <b>exempt</b> if the ox is damaged.

            "The Gemara concludes its analysis: <b>We come to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who says</b> that <b>unless the homeowner</b> explicitly <b>accepts upon himself</b> responsibility for <b>safeguarding,</b> he is not liable.

The same <i>halakha</i> applies even when granting permission to enter without specification, since, according to the Rabbis, granting permission to enter includes an implicit acceptance of responsibility for safeguarding.",
            "<b>Rav Pappa said: The entire</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who holds that if no specification was made, the owner of the courtyard does not accept responsibility, as inferred from the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>And</b> as for the inference drawn from the first clause, <b>he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Tarfon, who says:</b> For damage categorized as <b>Goring</b> that is carried out by an innocuous ox <b>in the courtyard of the injured</b> party, the ox’s owner <b>pays</b> the <b>full</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b>",
            "<b>Therefore,</b> if the owner of the courtyard <b>said to</b> the owner of the ox: <b>Safeguard it,</b> he is clearly <b>not transferring</b> the rights to any <b>portion of the courtyard to him,</b> as evident from the fact that the owner of the ox must safeguard it and may not treat the courtyard as if it were his own. Consequently, if the ox gored, <b>it is</b> a case of damage categorized as <b>Goring in the courtyard of the injured</b> party, <b>and</b> one responsible for damage categorized as <b>Goring in the courtyard of the injured</b> party <b>pays</b> the <b>full</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b>",
            "By contrast, if the owner of the courtyard <b>did not say to</b> the owner of the ox: <b>Safeguard it,</b> then by granting him permission to bring the ox onto his courtyard, he effectively <b>transfers</b> rights to <b>an area within the courtyard.</b> Therefore, with regard to damages, it becomes <b>a courtyard of partners, and</b> the one responsible for damage categorized as <b>Goring in the courtyard of partners pays only half</b> the cost of <b>the damage.</b>",

            "<b>And Rabbi Akiva,</b> by contrast, holds that one is liable only in the case of a pit located on private property, where he renounced ownership of the property aside from the pit, and one cannot derive otherwise from any extraneous phrases.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>the mishna, which teaches: Just as a pit that has sufficient</b> depth <b>to cause death</b> when falling into it is at least <b>ten handbreadths</b> deep, <b>so too, any</b> other excavations <b>that have sufficient</b> depth <b>to cause death</b> may be no less than <b>ten handbreadths</b> deep, why not say that a pit <b>with six</b> handbreadths would <b>also be sufficient?</b>",
            "The Sages <b>said</b> in reply: <b>The mishna</b> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the animal <b>rolled into the pit,</b> in which case the pit would be required to have a depth of ten handbreadths. By contrast, if it fell while walking, the extra height from the ground to its stomach is included in calculating the ten handbreadths.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>a pit belonging to two partners</b> was uncovered and <b>the first</b> partner <b>passed by it and did not cover it, and</b> then <b>the second</b> passed by it <b>and did not cover it, the second</b> is <b>liable</b> for any damage caused by means of the pit.",

According to him, <b>you find</b> such a case <b>where the courtyard belongs to both of them and the pit belongs to both of them, and they renounced ownership of their property but did not renounce ownership of their pit.</b> In that case, both are responsible for any damage caused.",
            "<b>But if we hold</b> that one who digs <b>a pit on his</b> own <b>property</b> and then declares the property, but not the pit, ownerless, is <b>exempt</b> from liability for damage caused, <b>how can you find</b> a case of a pit <b>for which</b> a person is <b>liable?</b> It can only be a case where it is located <b>in the public domain, and how can you find</b> a case of a <b>pit belonging to two partners in the public domain?</b>",

Therefore, this is also not treated as a jointly owned pit.",
            "The Gemara notes: <b>This works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and you find in</b> a case of <b>damage</b> that both would be liable, as the Gemara will soon explain.

The latter is solely liable, since only a pit of ten handbreadths renders a person liable for an animal’s death. <b>And</b> one <b>follows both of them</b> for restitution <b>for damage</b> caused by the pit.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of the Rabbis? As the verse states: “If</b> a man <b>shall open</b> a pit, <b>or if</b> a man <b>shall dig</b> a pit” (Exodus 21:33), it raises the question: <b>If</b> he is <b>liable for opening</b> a covered pit that has already been dug, then is it <b>not all the more so</b> that he should be liable <b>for digging</b> a new pit? What, then, does that latter phrase add? <b>Rather,</b> the verse serves <b>to include</b> the case of one person who begins to <b>dig</b> a pit and <b>after</b> he does so, a second person continues to <b>dig.</b> By subsequently stating: “If a man shall dig a pit,” the Torah teaches <b>that</b> a new pit is effectively created by the second digger, whose digging <b>removed,</b> i.e., rendered irrelevant, <b>the action of the first</b> digger and who bears full responsibility for the pit.",
            "<b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi could have <b>said to you: These</b> two clauses in the verse <b>are</b> both <b>necessary,</b> and the second clause cannot serve to teach the <i>halakha</i> of the sole liability of the second digger.

The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> don’t <b>the Rabbis also</b> agree that they <b>are necessary</b> for those interpretations? If so, what is the source of their opinion that responsibility for the pit rests solely with the second partner?",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the previous explanation must be rejected, and <b>this is the reason of the Rabbis:</b> The <b>verse states: “If a man shall dig a pit,”</b> indicating that <b>one</b> person is liable, <b>but not two.</b> Therefore, if two people jointly created the pit, the second bears responsibility and not the first.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi understand the phrase “if a man shall dig a pit”? The Gemara answers: <b>He requires that</b> phrase to teach another <i>halakha</i>.

            "The Gemara answers: It should <b>not enter your mind</b> to suggest this, <b>since the verse states: “And the carcass shall be for him”</b> (Exodus 21:34). This indicates that it is <b>the one who causes the death,</b> i.e., the second one, who is liable, and not the first. This is because it is the second one who completed digging the necessary depth for causing death, and not the first.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> isn’t <b>this</b> clause: <b>“And the carcass shall be for him,” necessary for that which Rava</b> states? <b>As Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>a disqualified consecrated ox that fell into a pit,</b> the pit’s owner is <b>exempt, as it is stated: “And the carcass shall be for him.”</b> Evidently, the verse is stated <b>with regard to</b> a case <b>where the carcass belongs</b> to him. This ox, which was consecrated and subsequently disqualified, does not fully belong to anybody, since its use is restricted. Since this verse serves to teach Rava’s ruling, it cannot serve to teach about the liability of the second digger.",

Is it not a dilemma</b> that was already raised <b>by Rava, as Rava asked: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a disqualified consecrated ox that fell into a pit?</b> Is <b>this</b> verse: <b>“And the carcass shall be for him,”</b> referring <b>to the one</b> to whom <b>the carcass belongs,</b> i.e., the owner of the pit, <b>excluding this</b> case <b>where the carcass does not belong to him,</b> and therefore the owner is exempt from paying for it? <b>Or perhaps</b> the verse <b>“And the carcass shall be for him” comes to teach that</b> the <b>owner</b> of the animal <b>attends to,</b> i.e., retains ownership of, <b>the carcass,</b> and the perpetrator of the damage pays him the difference?",
            "The Gemara answers: Initially, Rava was in doubt about the matter, but <b>after</b> he <b>raised the dilemma,</b> he <b>then resolved it</b> and concluded that the verse imposes liability for the cost of damage only on a person to whom the carcass belongs, excluding the case of a disqualified consecrated ox.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, from where does he</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> that the <b>owner attends to the animal carcass?</b> The Gemara answers: He <b>derives it from</b> the verse: <b>“And the carcass shall be for him”</b> (Exodus 21:36), stated <b>with regard to Ox.</b> The Gemara asks further: <b>What did you see</b> to determine <b>that from</b> the verse <b>“And the carcass shall be for him,”</b> stated <b>with regard to Ox, you derive</b> from it the <i>halakha</i> that <b>the owner</b> of the dead ox <b>attends to the carcass,</b> and from the verse <b>“And the carcass belongs to him,”</b> stated <b>with regard to Pit, you derive from it</b> the <i>halakha</i> that only <b>the one to whom the carcass belongs</b> pays damages? Why can’t <b>I reverse</b> the derivations from each verse and say the opposite?",
            "The Gemara answers: It <b>is reasonable</b> that the <b>exemption</b> applies to the verse stated <b>with regard to Pit, since</b> the Torah also <b>exempts</b> one from paying for damage classified as Pit caused to <b>vessels</b> that fall into it and break. The Gemara challenges this answer: <b>On the contrary,</b> one could claim that the <b>exemption</b> applies to the verse stated <b>with regard to Ox, since</b> the Torah also <b>exempted</b> the owner from <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage</b> in the case of an innocuous ox. The Gemara responds: <b>In any event, we do not find</b> that the owner of the ox is exempt from compensation for <b>the full</b> cost of <b>damage.</b> By contrast, with regard to Pit, there are certain items for which a person is not liable at all. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that the Torah is more lenient in cases of Pit than of Ox.",
            "§ The mishna teaches: If <b>an ox and its accoutrements,</b> i.e., the vessels it was carrying, <b>fell into</b> the pit <b>and</b> the vessels <b>were broken,</b> or if a donkey and its accoutrements fell in and the accoutrements were torn, the owner of the pit is liable for damage to the animal caused by the pit, but he is exempt from liability for damage caused to the vessels, by Torah edict. The Gemara notes: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda obligates</b> a person to pay <b>for damage</b> caused <b>to vessels in</b> cases of <b>Pit.</b>",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reasoning of the Rabbis? Since the verse states: “And an ox or a donkey fall therein”</b> (Exodus 21:33), it is inferred that it is specifically <b>an ox, but not a person,</b> for whose death the owner of the pit is liable. Moreover, one is liable for <b>a donkey, but not vessels.</b> By contrast, <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> expounds the word <b>“or”</b> in the expression “an ox or a donkey” <b>to include vessels.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis</b> explain the word “or”?"
        ],
        [
            "The word <b>“or”</b> is <b>necessary to separate</b> the cases of the ox and donkey. This indicates that if either falls in individually, the owner of the pit is liable. <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> <b>to separate</b> the cases in the verse? He derives it <b>from</b> the use of the singular form of the verb: <b>“And</b> an ox or donkey <b>fall [<i>venafal</i>],”</b> indicating that he is liable if even one animal falls. <b>And the Rabbis</b> maintain that the term <b>and fall</b> can also <b>indicate many</b> animals, as the use of the singular form of a verb does not prove that the subject is necessarily singular.",
            "The Gemara now challenges both opinions: <b>Say</b> that the term <b>“and fall”</b> is <b>a generalization,</b> whereas the phrase <b>“an ox or a donkey”</b> is <b>a detail.</b> According to the principles of halakhic exegesis, when the Torah presents <b>a generalization and a detail, the generalization</b> includes <b>only what</b> is contained <b>in the detail.</b> Therefore, <b>an ox and a donkey</b> are <b>indeed</b> included, but <b>anything else</b> is <b>not</b> included.",
            "The Sages <b>said</b> in response: The following verse: <b>“The owner of the pit shall pay”</b> (Exodus 21:34), means that <b>it then generalized</b> again. The verses are structured according to the principle of halakhic exegesis of: <b>A generalization, and a detail, and a generalization.</b> According to this principle, <b>you may deduce</b> that the verses are referring <b>only</b> to items that are <b>similar to the detail.</b> In this case, <b>just as the explicit detail</b> is referring to <b>animals, so too, all</b> items included in the generalization must be <b>animals.</b>",
            "The Gemara now challenges this answer: <b>If</b> so, <b>just as the explicit detail,</b> i.e., the ox and donkey, is referring to <b>items whose carcass renders</b> a person ritually <b>impure by contact or by carrying, so too, all items,</b> i.e., all animals, <b>whose carcass renders</b> a person ritually <b>impure through contact or by carrying,</b> should be included in the <i>halakhot</i> of damage classified as Pit. <b>But birds,</b> whose carcasses do not render a person impure through contact or by carrying, would <b>not</b> be included.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>If so, let the Merciful One write</b> only <b>one detail,</b> from which the exclusion of birds could be derived.

Therefore, the Torah states both an ox and a donkey.",
            "The original difficulty therefore resurfaces: Why is the verse not expounded as a generalization, a detail, and a generalization, thereby excluding birds? <b>Rather,</b> the previous method of deriving liability for a pit must be rejected, and instead it should be derived as follows: The <b>verse states: “And the carcass shall be for him”</b> (Exodus 21:34), from which it may be inferred that <b>anything subject to death</b> is included.",
            "The Gemara asks: If this is the basis for liability for a pit, then <b>both according to the Rabbis, who exclude vessels</b> from liability based on another verse, <b>and according to Rabbi Yehuda, who has amplified</b> the <i>halakha</i> to include <b>vessels,</b> one could ask: <b>Are vessels subject to death?</b> Clearly, vessels cannot be subject to death. Why, then, is a separate source necessary to derive their halakhic status? The Sages <b>said</b> in reply: Vessels may also be considered subject to death in the sense that <b>their shattering is</b> tantamount to <b>their death.</b>",
            "The Gemara continues to challenge this explanation: <b>But according to Rav, who says:</b> With regard to <b>Pit, for which the Torah deems</b> a person <b>liable,</b> it is only <b>for</b> damage caused by <b>its</b> lethal <b>fumes, but not for</b> damage caused by <b>the impact</b> of the fall, the following question may be raised <b>both according to the Rabbis and according to Rabbi Yehuda: Are vessels capable</b> of being broken by the lethal <b>fumes,</b> such that a verse is necessary to exclude them?

            "The Gemara asks further: But isn’t <b>this</b> verse: <b>“And the carcass shall be for him,” necessary for that which Rava</b> ruled, <b>as Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>a disqualified consecrated ox that fell into a pit,</b> the owner of the pit is <b>exempt, as it is stated: “And the carcass shall be for him.”</b> It is referring <b>to</b> a person to <b>whom</b> the <b>carcass belongs,</b> thereby <b>excluding this</b> person, to <b>whom</b> the <b>carcass</b> does <b>not belong.</b> Once a <i>halakha</i> has already been derived from this verse, it cannot be used as the basis for deriving a second <i>halakha</i>.",

Rav <b>is speaking</b> utilizing the style of: <b>It is not necessary,</b> and this is how to understand his statement: <b>It is not necessary</b> to state that if the animal fell into the garden and <b>ate</b> from its produce, <b>that</b> the owner <b>pays</b> for <b>the benefit that</b> it <b>derives. But</b> if the produce softened the blow of <b>striking</b> the ground and thereby the animal avoided injury, one might <b>say</b> that the owner of the animal should not pay, on the grounds that the owner of the garden may be viewed, analogously, to one who <b>repels a lion from another’s property.</b> In such a case, although the latter benefited from his action, he is not obligated to pay for it. Similarly in this case, one might think that the owner of the animal does <b>not pay even</b> for <b>the benefit that</b> the animal <b>derived.</b> For this reason Rav <b>teaches us</b> that the owner of the animal must pay for this benefit as well.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that <b>this is indeed</b> the <i>halakha</i>, and the owner of the animal should be exempt for paying for the benefit of his animal not being injured?",
            "The Gemara answers: One who <b>repels a lion from another’s property</b> does so <b>with intent,</b> knowing that he would be ineligible for payment. By contrast, <b>this</b> owner of the garden did <b>not</b> act <b>with intent</b> and would have preferred for the incident not to have happened. <b>Alternatively,</b> one could say that one who <b>repels a lion from another’s property does not</b> thereby <b>have any loss</b> himself. By contrast, <b>this</b> owner of the garden <b>has a loss,</b> in that his produce is damaged.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>How did</b> the animal <b>fall?</b> In which case does this <i>halakha</i> apply? <b>Rav Kahana says: It slipped on its</b> own <b>urine. Rava says: Another</b> animal belonging to the same owner <b>pushed it,</b> causing it to fall there.",
            "The Gemara explains: Rava, <b>the one who says that</b> the mishna is referring to a case where <b>another</b> animal <b>pushed it,</b> in which case the owner pays only for the benefit that the animal derived and is exempt from paying for the damage caused, holds that <b>all the more so</b> this <i>halakha</i> would apply in a case <b>where it slipped on its urine,</b> which is beyond the owner’s control. <b>But</b> Rav Kahana, <b>the one who says</b> that the mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> the animal <b>slipped on its urine,</b> holds that if, <b>however, another</b> animal <b>pushed it,</b> this indicates that the owner <b>was negligent</b> and should have prevented this happening. Therefore, in such a case, the owner <b>pays</b> for <b>what</b> his animal <b>damaged, since</b> the owner of the garden <b>can say to</b> the owner of the animal: <b>You should have led</b> your animals <b>across one by one,</b> so that they would not be able to push each other.",
            "<b>Rav Kahana says: They taught only</b> that the owner pays for the benefit that it derives <b>in the same garden bed</b> into which it fell, <b>but</b> if it went <b>from</b> one <b>garden bed to</b> another <b>garden bed</b> and ate from that one, the owner <b>pays</b> for <b>what it damaged. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Even</b> if the animal goes <b>from</b> one <b>garden bed to</b> another <b>garden bed</b> and eats, <b>and even</b> if the animal continues going from one bed to another and eating for <b>the entire day,</b> the owner pays only for the benefit that the animal derived and not for what it damaged, <b>unless it leaves</b> the garden entirely <b>and returns with</b> the owner’s <b>knowledge.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Pappa said,</b> explaining Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement: <b>Do not say</b> this means: <b>Unless</b> the animal <b>leaves with</b> the owner’s <b>knowledge and returns with</b> his <b>knowledge; rather, once it leaves</b> the garden <b>with</b> the owner’s <b>knowledge, even if it returned without</b> his <b>knowledge,</b> the owner is liable to pay for what it damaged. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is <b>that</b> the owner of the garden can <b>say to</b> the owner of the animal: <b>Since</b> the animal <b>has</b> now <b>learned</b> that the garden is there with food to eat, <b>every time it strays it will run to there.</b>",
            "§ The mishna teaches: If the animal <b>descended</b> into the garden <b>in its usual manner and caused damage</b> there, the owner <b>pays</b> for <b>what it damaged. Rabbi Yirmeya asks:</b> If the animal <b>descended in its usual manner and</b> gave birth to a calf there and <b>damaged</b> the produce <b>with amniotic fluid, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does the owner of the animal have to pay for this damage?",
            "The Gemara clarifies Rabbi Yirmeya’s question: <b>Do not raise the dilemma in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the one who says</b> that one is <b>liable</b> in a case of damage that is <b>initially through negligence and ultimately by accident,</b> since in this case the owner was negligent in allowing the animal to enter another person’s courtyard, although the actual causing of the damage was ultimately by accident. <b>When should you raise this dilemma?</b> Raise it <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of the one who says</b> that one is <b>exempt</b> in a case that is <b>initially through negligence and ultimately by accident.

            "§ The mishna teaches: <b>How does</b> the court appraise the value of the damage when the owner <b>pays</b> for <b>what it damaged?</b> The court appraises a large piece of land with an area required for sowing one se’a of seed [<i>beit se’a</i>] in that field, including the garden bed in which the damage took place, it appraises how much it was worth before the animal damaged it and how much is it worth now, and the owner must pay the difference. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived?",
            "<b>Rav Mattana says: As the verse states: “And it feed in another field [<i>uvi’er bisde aḥer</i>]”</b> (Exodus 22:4). This <b>teaches that</b> the court <b>appraises</b> the damage <b>relative to another field,</b> i.e., relative to the damaged field as a whole and not an appraisal of only the specific garden bed that was damaged.",
            "The Gemara asks: But <b>this</b> phrase: <b>“<i>Uvi’er bisde aḥer</i>,”</b> can be understood as meaning: “And it feed in another’s field,” and accordingly, <b>is necessary</b> to teach that the owner is not liable unless it was a field with an owner, <b>to exclude</b> damage caused by an animal in <b>the public domain,</b> for which the owner is not liable.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> if this was the sole intention of the verse, <b>let the Merciful One write</b> in the Torah: <b>And it feed in a field belonging to another [<i>uvi’er bisde ḥaveiro</i>], or alternatively,</b> let it write: And it consume <b>another field [<i>sedeh aḥer</i>].” What</b> is conveyed by the particular expression: <b>“In another field [<i>bisde aḥer</i>]”?</b> It is to teach that the court <b>appraises</b> the damage <b>relative to another field.</b>",
            "<b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that this verse <b>comes entirely for this</b> purpose, i.e., to teach that the court appraises the damage relative to another field?

            "The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> it is <b>so</b> that the verse was referring solely to the method of appraising the damage, <b>the Merciful One should have written this</b> in the Torah <b>in the context of payment,</b> as follows: <b>His best-quality field and the best quality of his vineyard he shall pay in another field</b> (see Exodus 22:4), thereby adding the term: In another field, and, by extension, the directive concerning how the damage is appraised, to the verse discussing payment. <b>Why do I</b> need <b>the Merciful One to write it in</b> the context of the act of damaging, in the verse: <b>“And it feed</b> in another field”? <b>Conclude two</b> conclusions <b>from it:</b> The verse is referring to both the place where the damage occurred and the method by which the damage is appraised.",
            "§ The Gemara asks: <b>How do we,</b> the court, <b>appraise</b> the value of the damage? <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina says:</b> The court appraises the value of an area required for sowing one <b><i>se’a</i></b> of seed [<i>beit se’a</i>] <b>relative to</b> an area required for sowing <b>sixty <i>se’a</i></b> of seed, and according to this calculation determines the value of the damage. <b>Rabbi Yannai says:</b> The court appraises each <b><i>tarkav</i>,</b> equivalent to half a <i>beit se’a</i>, <b>relative to</b> an area of <b>sixty <i>tarkav</i>.

            "<b>What is the reason</b> that Rabbi Yishmael does not hold in accordance with the opinion of Rav Idi bar Avin? It is because he accepts the principle that <b>the burden of proof rests upon the claimant;</b> without such proof, the owner of the animal pays only the value of a lesser-quality garden bed. <b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Yishmael interprets the Torah’s expression “the best of his field” as requiring payment <b>with the best</b>-quality land <b>before him, and what is this?</b> It is <b>that which</b> remained in the field and subsequently <b>sprouted,</b> and the compensation is based on the value of this.",

Consequently, when he ultimately kills the animal, he pays the fourfold or fivefold payment according to its value when he first began to weaken it, i.e., at the time of the theft. <b>When Rav says</b> his ruling, <b>he is saying</b> it only <b>with regard to</b> cases of <b>appreciation</b> in value <b>and depreciation</b> in value, not to changes in the animal’s physical state.",

            "This statement is inaccurate in this case, as <b>the double payment,</b> i.e., the penalty included in the double payment, is <b>four</b> dinars, <b>and the</b> additional <b>one-fifth is one dinar.</b> When the Torah states “fifth” it means one-fifth of the total payment of the one-fifth and the principal together, i.e., one-quarter of the principal.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai,</b> who maintains that this bailee is exempt from a guilt-offering as well, how would he respond to the Sages’ argument concerning “<i>et</i>”?

            "The Gemara clarifies the source of these two opinions. <b>What is the reason of Beit Shammai</b> for prohibiting these products? <b>As it is written:</b> “You shall not bring the hire of a harlot, or the price of a dog, into the house of the Lord your God for any vow; for even both of these are an abomination to the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 23:19).

If there was a change in the animal’s value due to fluctuation of the monetary <b>value</b> of animals, he pays <b>according to</b> the animal’s worth <b>now,</b> at the time of standing trial.",
            "§ <b>Rabba said:</b> The principle that <b>a change</b> in a stolen item causes the thief to <b>acquire</b> it <b>is written</b> in the Torah, <b>and we learned</b> it in a mishna as well. <b>It is written</b> in the Torah: “Then it shall be, if he has sinned, and is guilty, <b>that he shall restore the item that he robbed”</b> (Leviticus 5:23). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> the seemingly superfluous phrase <b>“that he robbed”?</b> This serves to teach that <b>if</b> the item is the same <b>as</b> it was <b>when he stole</b> it, <b>he must return</b> the stolen item itself. <b>But if</b> it is <b>not</b> the same as it was then, <b>he is required</b> to <b>pay only money,</b> while the stolen item remains his to keep.",
            "<b>We learned</b> this <i>halakha</i> in a mishna as well, as it is taught (93b): In the case of <b>one who robs</b> another of <b>wood and fashions it</b> into <b>vessels,</b> or one who robs another of <b>wool and fashions it</b> into <b>garments, he pays</b> the robbery victim <b>according to</b> the value of the goods at the <b>time of the robbery,</b> and keeps the altered materials for himself.",
            "<b>Alternatively,</b> another mishna can serve as the source for this principle (<i>Ḥullin</i> 135a): <b>If one did not manage to give</b> the first of the sheared wool of his sheep to a priest <b>until</b> after <b>he dyed it</b> (see Deuteronomy 18:4), he is <b>exempt</b> from giving it to the priest. This mishna indicates that an item that has undergone a change is no longer considered the same item as it had been. <b>Apparently,</b> a physical <b>change</b> in a stolen item causes the thief to <b>acquire</b> it.",
            "§ Rabba continues to discuss the ways in which a thief acquires ownership of a stolen item: With regard to the owner’s <b>despair</b> over ever recovering the stolen item, <b>the Sages say that</b> this too causes the thief to <b>acquire</b> the stolen item. <b>However, we do not know if</b> this <i>halakha</i> applies <b>by Torah law or by rabbinic law.</b>",
            "Rabba elaborates on the two possibilities he has just mentioned: <b>If</b> it applies <b>by Torah law,</b> this is <b>just as it is with regard to one who finds a lost item.</b> Is it <b>not</b> the case with regard to <b>one who finds a lost item</b> that <b>once</b> the <b>owner</b> of the item <b>despairs</b> of recovering it, <b>before</b> the item <b>came into</b> the finder’s <b>possession,</b> the finder <b>acquires it</b> and may keep it for himself? The same principle applies to <b>this</b> thief <b>as well: Once the owner</b> of the item <b>despairs</b> of recovering it, the thief <b>acquires it</b> for himself and need no longer return it. <b>Apparently,</b> then, the despair of the owner causes the thief to <b>acquire</b> the stolen item.",
            "<b>Or perhaps</b> the case of a stolen item is <b>not comparable to</b> the case <b>of a lost item,</b> as <b>it is</b> only with regard to <b>a lost item</b> that the owner’s despair enables the finder to acquire the item, because the item <b>came into his possession in a permitted</b> manner. <b>But</b> in <b>this</b> case of the thief, <b>since</b> the item <b>came into his possession in a prohibited</b> manner, this case cannot be derived from the <i>halakha</i> of a lost item. If so, the ruling that despair effects acquisition in a case of theft applies not by Torah law but <b>by rabbinic law.</b>",
            "Why would this <i>halakha</i> have been instituted by rabbinic law? <b>As, the Sages said that</b> a thief <b>should acquire</b> the stolen item in this manner, <b>due to an ordinance</b> instituted <b>for the penitent.</b> To encourage thieves to repent and repay their victims, the Sages instituted that they need not return the stolen item after the owner despairs of recovering it.

            "<b>And Rav Yosef says: Despair</b> on the part of the owner over the possibility of recovering his item <b>does not</b> cause the thief to <b>acquire</b> that item at all, <b>and</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even by rabbinic law.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Yosef raised an objection to Rabba</b> from a mishna (96b): If <b>one robbed</b> another of <b>leavened bread and Passover elapsed</b> in the meantime, so that deriving benefit from it is prohibited,"

            "<b>And</b> although the two <i>tanna’im</i> of the mishna disagree as to which situation involves an owner’s despair of recovery, whether robbery or theft, in any event one can <b>conclude from</b> this mishna that the <b>despair</b> of the owner causes the thief or robber to <b>acquire</b> the item, as otherwise the perpetrator’s thoughts about the hide would have no effect on its status with regard to ritual impurity. Rav Yosef <b>said to</b> Abaye in response: <b>With what are we dealing here</b> in this mishna? It is a case <b>where</b> the thief or robber <b>trimmed</b> the leather by cutting it. Although trimming a piece of leather is not a sufficient change to constitute an act of acquisition by itself, it is effective in conjunction with the owner’s despair.",
            "<b>Rabba bar Rav Ḥanan objects to this</b> answer: <b>But</b> is it <b>not</b> the case that <b>they taught</b> this mishna <b>here</b> with regard to a leather table <b>top [<i>itzba</i>]? And</b> a leather table <b>top does not require trimming,</b> either due to the fact that its edges are not seen or because it is merely ornamental. Since it does not require trimming, this action should not be considered an act of acquisition at all.",
            "<b>As we learned</b> in the previous mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 26:7): <b>Wherever there is no work lacking</b> for an item to be considered finished, one’s <b>thought renders it susceptible to ritual impurity; when there is</b> still some <b>work lacking</b> for the item to be considered finished, <b>thought does not render it susceptible to ritual impurity, except for</b> the case of a leather table <b>top.</b> Although further work is required to smooth out the edges, one’s thought can render it susceptible to impurity because people do not care if this leather table top has uneven edges. It is with regard to this case of a table top that the mishna distinguishes between a homeowner and a leatherworker. Therefore, Rav Yosef’s explanation is rejected.",
            "The Gemara suggests a different answer. <b>Rather, Rava said</b> that <b>this matter was a difficulty</b> posed by <b>Rabba to Rav Yosef for twenty-two years, and it was not resolved until Rav Yosef sat as the head</b> of the yeshiva <b>and resolved it</b> in the following manner: <b>A change in name</b> of an item, representing a change in status, <b>is similar to</b> a physical <b>change</b> brought about by <b>an action.</b>",
            "<b>What is the reason</b> that a physical <b>change</b> through <b>an action</b> causes the thief to acquire the item? It is because <b>there</b> the stolen items were <b>initially</b> just <b>wood,</b> and <b>now</b> they are <b>vessels.</b> The same can be said for <b>a change in name as well: Initially they called it a hide, and now</b> they call it a table <b>top [<i>abrazin</i>].</b>",
            "The Gemara asks a question with regard to changes in name: <b>But</b> what about the case of <b>a beam, where there is a change in name, as initially,</b> when it was stolen, it was called <b>a beam, and now,</b> after it has been placed in a building, it is called <b>a joist [<i>telala</i>], and</b> yet <b>we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 55a): <b>With regard to a stolen beam that</b> a robber <b>had built into</b> a large <b>building,</b> the court ruled <b>that</b> the owner <b>should</b> receive <b>its</b> value in <b>money</b> rather than demand that the robber demolish the house to return the beam itself, <b>because of an ordinance</b> instituted <b>for the penitent,</b> i.e., to encourage robbers to admit their crime and reimburse the owner of the stolen item.",
            "This mishna indicates that <b>the</b> only <b>reason</b> the robber does not have to return the beam itself is <b>because of</b> this <b>ordinance</b> instituted <b>for the penitent.</b>"

        [
            "One can infer: <b>But</b> if were <b>not</b> for <b>this</b> decree, the beam would have to be <b>returned</b> to the owner <b>as is,</b> notwithstanding its change in name. <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> This is not a genuine change in name, as <b>a beam retains its name</b> even after it is inserted into a building. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to two obscure terms: The verse states: “And there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch; there were also the <i>tzalot</i> of the house, and the <i>ubbim</i>” (Ezekiel 41:26). <b>“<i>Tzalot</i> of the house”; these are the casings [<i>hamaltetin</i>]. “And the <i>ubbim</i>”; these are the beams [<i>hamerishot</i>].</b> This shows that a beam can retain its name even after it has been built into a house.",
            "<b>Rabbi Zeira said</b> a different answer: With regard to <b>a change in name, a change</b> in which the item <b>can revert to its original state is not</b> considered enough of <b>a change</b> for the thief to acquire the stolen item. Since the joist can be removed and revert to being called a beam, it is not considered a true change of name.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And is a change in name</b> in <b>which</b> the item <b>does not revert to its original state</b> really considered <b>a change?

The water in a ritual bath must be gathered directly from rain or a stream, not drawn with vessels. If one hollowed out a log and used it to channel water into the bath, this is considered drawn water, as he used a vessel.",
            "By contrast, if <b>one attached it</b> first <b>and afterward hollowed it out, it does not invalidate the ritual bath.</b> Before the log was hollowed out, it was already attached to and considered part of the ground, and therefore the act of hollowing it out does not turn it into a vessel.",
            "The Gemara states its question: <b>And if you say that a change in name is</b> considered <b>a matter</b> of significance, i.e., it is considered a real change in the item, then <b>even if one attached</b> the log first <b>and afterward hollowed it out,</b> the ritual bath <b>should also be invalid.</b> Since hollowing out the log leads to a change in name, it should be considered a new vessel at that point.",
            "The Gemara answers: The <i>halakha</i> that <b>drawn</b> water may not be used for a ritual bath <b>is different, as it</b> applies <b>by rabbinic law,</b> and consequently the Sages were lenient in this case.

This individual is obligated to add one-fifth to the amount he stole (see Leviticus 5:21–24). The apparently redundant phrase “that he took by robbery,” teaches that the requirement to add one-fifth applies only to the sinner himself, not to his heirs (see 104b).",

The Gemara asks: <b>Why do you reverse the <i>baraita</i></b> to avoid a contradiction between the statements of Rabbi Yoḥanan?

            "<b>Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Yosei, and Rabbi Shimon prohibit</b> one from doing so. The objection of these three Sages is presumably that this arrangement relies on the principle of retroactive designation, as at the time of the declaration the identity of the particular portions of wine that will be <i>teruma</i> and tithes is unknown, and these Sages do not accept this principle. It is apparent from this mishna that Rabbi Yehuda does not accept retroactive designation, and therefore he cannot be the one who said that the owner of the field may issue his declaration of relinquishment in the morning.",

This demonstrates that Rabbi Yoḥanan does not hold that it is retroactively clarified that each brother’s portion was designated for him directly upon their father’s death, but rather all the land was considered joint property until the brothers traded or bought their respective portions from each other at the time of the distribution of the estate.",
            "In light of this objection, the Gemara retracts its previous assertion that Rabbi Yoḥanan reformulated the declaration of the pious ones. <b>Rather,</b> the pious ones <b>actually</b> declared in the past tense: <b>Anything that was picked</b> from this vine by passersby shall be desacralized onto these coins, i.e., the desacralizing took place after the grapes were stolen. If so, the question remains: Why did Rabbi Yoḥanan not accept the opinion of the pious ones, but instead ruled that the owner of an item cannot consecrate it after it has been stolen?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan found a different unattributed</b> mishna, which contradicts the opinion of the pious ones. <b>As we learned</b> in the mishna here (62b): <b>One who steals</b> an item <b>after a thief</b> has already stolen it, i.e., one who steals a stolen item, <b>does not pay</b> the <b>double payment</b> to the thief or to the prior owner. <b>Why</b> not? <b>Granted</b> that <b>he does not pay to the first thief, as</b> the verse states: <b>“And it was stolen from the house of the man;</b> if the thief shall be found he shall pay double” (Exodus 22:6), which indicates that the double payment applies in the case of an item “stolen from the house of the man,” i.e., from the owner’s jurisdiction, but <b>not</b> to an item stolen from <b>the thief’s house. But let him pay</b> the double payment <b>to the owner,</b> as it presumably still belonged to the owner when the second thief stole it.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> this that a stolen item is not under the full jurisdiction of either the owner or the thief? It is not under the jurisdiction of <b>this</b> one, the first thief, <b>because it does not belong to him, and</b> it is not under the jurisdiction of <b>that</b> one, the owner, <b>because it is not in his possession.</b> Therefore, neither of them can consecrate the stolen item.",
            "The Gemara asks: Granted that this unattributed mishna disagrees with the mishna that cites the pious ones, <b>but what did you see</b> that led you to <b>follow that unattributed</b> mishna, the one that discusses the double payment? <b>Let</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>act,</b> i.e., rule, <b>in accordance with this unattributed</b> mishna, which states the practice <b>of the pious ones.</b> On what basis did he choose one mishna over the other?",
            "The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yoḥanan followed the mishna that discusses the double payment <b>because</b> there is <b>a verse</b> that <b>supports it: “And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 27:14), from which it is derived: <b>Just as one’s house is in his possession, so too anything</b> that one consecrates must <b>be in his possession,</b> excluding items that have been stolen from him.",
            "§ <b>Abaye said: If Rabbi Yoḥanan had not said</b> that <b>the pious ones and Rabbi Dosa said the same thing,</b> i.e., their rulings are identical, <b>I would say</b> that <b>the pious ones accept</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Dosa, but Rabbi Dosa does not accept</b> the opinion <b>of the pious ones.</b>",
            "Abaye elaborates: <b>The pious ones accept</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Dosa,</b> for the following reason: <b>And if the Sages instituted an ordinance for</b> the sake of <b>a thief,</b> to prevent him from eating unredeemed fourth-year grapes, by allowing the owner to desacralize produce that is no longer in his possession, does it <b>need to be said</b> that they did so for the sake of innocent <b>poor people,</b> as Rabbi Dosa claimed? Conversely, <b>Rabbi Dosa does not accept</b> the opinion <b>of the pious ones,</b> as he says: It <b>is</b> for the sake of <b>poor people that the Sages instituted an ordinance; but the Sages did not institute an ordinance for</b> the sake of <b>a thief,</b> in line with the aforementioned principle: Feed it to the wicked man and let him die.",
            "In a similar vein, <b>Rava said: If Rabbi Yoḥanan had not said</b> that <b>the pious ones and Rabbi Dosa said the same thing, I would say</b> that there is a fundamental difference between the cases of fourth-year produce and gleanings taken by the poor, as one could claim: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> the ruling of the <b>pious ones?

            "<b>Doesn’t Rabbi Meir say</b> that second <b>tithe is property</b> belonging to the <b>Most High,</b> rather than the possession of the one who separated it from his produce, <b>and even so, with regard to redemption</b> of the second tithe <b>the Merciful One establishes it in his possession? As it is written</b> concerning the second tithe: <b>“And if a man will redeem any of his tithe, he shall add to it its fifth part”</b> (Leviticus 27:31).",
            "Although according to the opinion of Rabbi Meir, second tithe does not belong to the owner of the produce from which it was separated, nevertheless, with regard to redemption <b>the Merciful One</b> does distinguish between a stranger and one who separated it from his produce, as the Torah <b>refers to</b> the second tithe as <b>“his tithe” and</b> thereby decrees that <b>he,</b> the owner of the crop from which it is separated, can redeem it by <b>adding one-fifth</b> to its value, but no one else can do so. This indicates that although second-tithe produce is not in fact owned by the person, the Torah treats him as the owner of the produce.",
            "With regard to <b>a fourth-year vineyard as well,</b> the Sages <b>derive</b> many of its <i>halakhot</i> <b>from</b> a verbal analogy between <b>second tithe</b> and fourth-year fruit, based on the use of the word <b>“holy”</b> in the context of fourth-year fruit and <b>“holy”</b> in the context of second tithe. <b>It is written here,</b> concerning fourth-year fruit trees: “And in the fourth year all its fruit shall be <b>holy, for giving praise</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 19:24), <b>and it is written with regard to second tithe: “And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord’s; it is holy”</b> (Leviticus 27:30).",
            "From this analogy it is derived: <b>Just as</b> in the case of the term <b>“holy” that is written in connection to</b> second <b>tithe, even though it is property</b> belonging to the <b>Most High, with regard to redemption the Merciful One establishes it in</b> the <b>jurisdiction</b> of the one who separated it, <b>so too</b> in the context of the word <b>“holy” that is written in connection to</b> the <b>fourth-year vineyard, even though it is not his property,</b> as it belongs to the Most High, <b>with regard to desacralizing the Merciful One establishes it in</b> the vineyard owner’s <b>jurisdiction.</b>",
            "The effect of this determination is <b>that</b> even <b>when</b> the fruit <b>is in his jurisdiction it is not his</b> property, <b>and</b> yet <b>he is able to desacralize it.</b> And <b>due to that</b> reason the owner of the vineyard <b>is able to desacralize</b> the fruit even after a thief has taken it. Even in normal circumstances when one desacralizes his fourth-year fruit he is desacralizing fruit that does not belong to him. Consequently, there is no novelty in the ruling that one can desacralize fruit even after it has been taken by a thief.",
            "<b>But with regard to gleanings</b> of the poor, <b>since</b> the extra sheaves that the poor people inadvertently take <b>are the property of</b> the owner of the field, it may be claimed that only <b>when</b> those sheaves <b>are in his possession,</b> i.e., they have not been taken by anyone else, <b>can he relinquish</b> his <b>ownership of</b> them, whereas <b>when</b> they are <b>no</b> longer <b>in his possession he cannot relinquish</b> his <b>ownership of</b> them. Consequently, the pious ones, who permitted redemption of fourth-year produce after it had been stolen, would not necessarily agree with Rabbi Dosa, who allowed the relinquishment of stolen sheaves.",
            "In a similar vein, <b>Ravina said: If Rabbi Yoḥanan had not said</b> that <b>the pious ones and Rabbi Dosa said the same thing, I would say: Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> the opinion of the <b>pious ones?

It is <b>because the other</b> party, the bailee or debtor, <b>can say</b> to the collector who presents a document without this clause: <b>I am not legally answerable to you;</b> I am willing to deal only with the person to whom the item is owed. To avoid this situation, the authorization document must transfer actual ownership of the item to the collector, who is now claiming it for himself.",

            "The Gemara answers: It is possible that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis as well, as one can explain that it is speaking of a case <b>in</b> which the purchaser <b>says</b> to the thief: <b>Your stolen</b> animal <b>shall not be acquired by me until it rests</b> on the ground. In that case, the acquisition of the animal and the Shabbat desecration are simultaneous.",
            "<b>Rava said: Actually,</b> it is possible to explain the <b><i>baraita</i> as Rami bar Ḥama</b> did, that the animal was acquired through the picking of a fig on Shabbat. And the objection raised earlier, that this act should not be considered a sale at all, is incorrect. This can be demonstrated by the fact that the <b>Torah prohibits</b> one to bring as an offering an animal given as the <b>payment</b> to a prostitute for services rendered (Deuteronomy 23:19). <b>And</b> this prohibition applies <b>even</b> if the man in question <b>engaged in intercourse with his own mother,</b> which is a capital offense. <b>But if she</b> would bring <b>a legal claim before us, demanding</b> the payment of the animal that was agreed upon as her fee, <b>would we say to him: Arise and pay her</b> the animal?

            "The Gemara provides several reasons why in the case of fourfold or fivefold payment it is possible for the thief to be liable for another’s actions. <b>Rava said:</b> It <b>is different here, as the verse states: “And slaughter it or sell it”</b> (Exodus 21:37), thereby juxtaposing the two acts of slaughtering and selling. It is derived that <b>just as</b> there is liability for the fourfold or fivefold payment through <b>selling,</b> which by definition is performed <b>by means of another</b> party, <b>so too,</b> there is liability for <b>slaughtering</b> when it is performed <b>by means of another</b> party.",

Can it be that if the thief himself slaughtered the animal on Shabbat he would be exempt, whereas if he has it slaughtered by another he is liable?",
            "<b>Rav Ashi said to him: There,</b> in the case of the thief who slaughters a stolen animal on Shabbat, <b>it is not because he is not liable</b> that he does not pay the fourfold or fivefold payment; <b>rather,</b> he is liable but he is excused from payment <b>because he receives the greater of</b> the two punishments, i.e., execution, for desecrating Shabbat.

            "The Sages <b>say</b> in explanation: <b>Who</b> are these <b>Rabbis</b> of the <i>baraita</i>? It is <b>Rabbi Shimon, who said:</b> The legal status of an act of <b>slaughter that is not fit</b> for accomplishing its full ritual purpose <b>is not considered</b> an act of <b>slaughter.</b> Since slaughtering on Shabbat or slaughtering for idolatrous purposes does not render the meat fit for consumption, Rabbi Shimon rules that there is no liability for the fourfold or fivefold payment.",
            "The Sages <b>say,</b> questioning this explanation: <b>Granted,</b> slaughtering for <b>idol worship and</b> slaughtering <b>an ox that is</b> sentenced to be <b>stoned are</b> cases of <b>slaughter that is not fit,</b> as in both of these cases it is prohibited to derive any benefit from the animal’s flesh. <b>But</b> slaughtering on <b>Shabbat is a fit slaughter.

            "The Sages <b>say</b> in response: Rabbi Shimon <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan HaSandlar,</b> who disagrees with that mishna and prohibits eating the meat of an animal slaughtered on Shabbat.",
            "<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 2:3): In the case of <b>one who cooks</b> food <b>on Shabbat,</b> if he acted <b>unwittingly he may eat</b> the food, but if he acted <b>intentionally he may not eat</b> it; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If he acted <b>unwittingly he may eat</b> the food only <b>upon the conclusion of Shabbat,</b> and if he acted <b>intentionally he may not eat</b> it <b>ever,</b> although others may partake of it.",

It follows that Rabbi Yoḥanan HaSandlar maintains that the meat of an animal intentionally slaughtered on Shabbat may never be eaten. If so, this is a slaughter that does not render the meat fit for consumption, and therefore according to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon there is no fourfold or fivefold payment.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason for</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan HaSandlar?</b> The Gemara explains: This is <b>as Rabbi Ḥiyya taught at the entrance to the house of the <i>Nasi</i>.</b> It is written: <b>“And you shall observe Shabbat, for it is holy [<i>kodesh</i>] to you;</b> one who profanes it shall be put to death” (Exodus 31:14). <b>Just as it is prohibited to eat a sacred</b> item consecrated to the Temple [<i>kodesh</i>], <b>so too is it prohibited to eat</b> food produced though <b>action</b> that desecrates <b>Shabbat.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> so, perhaps the analogy should be extended: <b>Just as it is prohibited to derive benefit</b> from <b>a sacred</b> item, <b>so too</b> should it be <b>prohibited to derive benefit</b> from a product of <b>an action</b> that desecrates <b>Shabbat.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states:</b> “It is holy <b>to you”</b> (Exodus 31:14), indicating that <b>it shall be yours</b> for deriving benefit. Although food cooked on Shabbat may not be eaten, it is permitted to benefit from it in other ways.",

To counter this, <b>the verse states: “One who profanes it shall be put to death”</b> (Exodus 31:14), indicating that it is <b>with regard to</b> one who desecrates Shabbat <b>intentionally</b> that <b>I said</b> this analogy <b>to you,</b> as the verse clearly is referring to one who is liable to receive the death penalty, <b>but not</b> one who desecrates Shabbat <b>unwittingly,</b> who is not executed.",

            "The Gemara elaborates: <b>The one who says</b> it is forbidden <b>by Torah law</b> explains <b>as we said,</b> that the prohibition is based on the verse as interpreted by Rabbi Ḥiyya. <b>And the one who says</b> it is forbidden <b>by rabbinic law</b> would say that <b>the verse states: “It is holy,”</b> from which he infers: <b>It,</b> the day itself, <b>is holy but</b> the products of <b>its</b> prohibited <b>actions are not holy,</b> and therefore they are not compared to sacred items and may be eaten by Torah law.",

            "The Gemara answers: When the Rabbis exempt him from the fourfold or fivefold payment, they are not referring to the case where the thief’s agent slaughters the animal on Shabbat.

            "The Gemara asks another question with regard to the interpretation of the <i>baraita</i> presented above: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> granted he maintains that the legal status of an act of slaughter not fit for accomplishing its full ritual purpose is nevertheless considered an act of slaughter.

            "The Gemara raises a question with regard to another of the cases of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>An ox that is</b> sentenced to be <b>stoned is an item from which</b> deriving <b>benefit is prohibited.</b> Consequently, when a thief or his agent slaughters this animal, it is <b>not</b> an animal that belongs <b>to its owner</b> that he <b>slaughters, and</b> it is <b>not</b> an animal that belongs <b>to him</b> that he <b>slaughters.</b> Why does Rabbi Meir obligate him to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment?",
            "<b>Rava said: With what are we dealing here?</b> This is a case <b>where</b> the owners <b>entrusted</b> the ox <b>to a bailee and</b> the ox fatally <b>injured</b> someone while <b>in the bailee’s house, and it was forewarned</b> while <b>in the bailee’s house, and it was sentenced</b> to be stoned while <b>in the bailee’s house,</b> and the thief then stole it from the bailee’s house and slaughtered it.

            "<b>He holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ya’akov, who says: Even after</b> the ox <b>was sentenced</b> to be stoned, if the <b>bailee returned it to its owners</b> before it was killed, <b>it is</b> considered <b>returned.</b> Although the ox is now worthless, as no benefit may be derived from it, since the bailee returned a physically intact ox, the owner has no claim against him.",
            "<b>And</b> Rabbi Meir also <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who says: An item whose</b> elimination <b>causes financial</b> loss <b>is considered</b> to have <b>monetary</b> value. With regard to an item that is otherwise worthless, if its elimination causes monetary loss due to the fact that it must be replaced, it is considered to be of value. In this case, although the ox is worthless in and of itself, when the thief slaughters it he prevents the bailee from returning it intact to the owner and causes him to be obligated to pay the owner the value of the ox before it was sentenced to be stoned. Consequently, the thief must reimburse the bailee, as the ox effectively has value for that bailee.",
            "<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (74b): <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> In the case of <b>sacrificial</b> animals <b>for which</b> the owner <b>bears</b> financial <b>responsibility</b> to replace any of them with another animal if it is lost or it dies, the thief is <b>obligated</b> to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment if he slaughters the animal. Although one is generally not liable to pay the double payment for stealing consecrated items, Rabbi Shimon maintains that this case is different, since as a result of the animal’s theft the owner sustains a loss by being required to substitute another animal for it. Since the animal’s loss has financial ramifications for the owner apart from any inherent value it has, it has value for him. <b>Apparently,</b> Rabbi Shimon holds that <b>an item whose</b> elimination <b>causes financial</b> loss <b>is considered</b> to have <b>monetary</b> value.",

            "<b>As, if it enters your mind</b> that it is prohibited <b>by Torah law</b> the mishna here would be difficult, for <b>as soon as he slaughtered</b> the animal <b>a bit,</b> at the very start of the act of slaughter, <b>he has prohibited</b> the animal, with regard to deriving benefit, as a non-sacred animal slaughtered in the Temple courtyard. When he slaughters <b>the other</b> part it is already prohibited with regard to deriving benefit, which means that it is <b>not</b> an animal that belongs <b>to its owner</b> that he <b>slaughters.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to</b> Rav Ḥavivi: It is possible to explain the mishna even according to the opinion that the halakhic ramifications of slaughtering are in effect throughout the slaughter, and even if one maintains that it is prohibited by Torah law to benefit from a non-sacred animal slaughtered in the Temple. As, <b>when does</b> the thief <b>become obligated</b> to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment <b>as well?</b> It is <b>when</b> he performs <b>that</b> first <b>bit</b> of slaughter in the beginning, before the animal becomes forbidden. <b>Rav Ashi said to</b> Rav Huna: <b>Do not dismiss</b> Rav Ḥavivi’s suggestion with this explanation. The verse: “If a man steal an ox or a sheep, <b>and slaughter it”</b> (Exodus 21:37), indicates that in order to impose liability to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment <b>we require</b> that the thief slaughtered it <b>completely, and</b> after having slaughtered it just a bit <b>there is no</b> complete slaughter yet.",

It is in a case <b>where</b> the thief <b>slaughtered part</b> of the <b><i>simanim</i> outside</b> the Temple, <b>and finished</b> slaughtering <b>them inside</b> the Temple.

Any testimony he may have provided after that point in time is retroactively nullified. <b>Rava says: He is disqualified</b> only <b>from that point forward,</b> i.e., from when he was established to be a conspiring witness, but not retroactively from when he provided his testimony.",
            "The Gemara explains the reasons for the two opinions: <b>Abaye says he is disqualified retroactively</b> because it is <b>from that time when he testified</b> that <b>he is</b> considered <b>a wicked man, and the Torah said: “Do not put</b> your hand with <b>the wicked</b> to be an unrighteous <b>witness”</b> (Exodus 23:1), which is interpreted to mean: Do not allow a wicked man to serve as a witness.",

Therefore, even if the disqualification of these witnesses is established retroactively, they were not disqualified when they provided their single testimony concerning the theft and the slaughter.",
            "The Gemara proposes: <b>Let us say</b> that the dispute between Abaye and Rava is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b> As it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: In a case where <b>there were two</b> witnesses <b>testifying against</b> someone, claiming <b>that</b> he <b>stole</b> an animal, <b>and they</b> subsequently <b>testify against him that</b> he <b>slaughtered</b> the animal, <b>and they were rendered conspiring witnesses</b> only with regard to their testimony <b>concerning the theft,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the principle that <b>testimony that was partially invalidated is entirely invalidated.</b> In other words, the testimony concerning the slaughter of the animal is null and void, as there is no longer any testimony that the animal was ever stolen. Therefore, the witnesses pay the double payment for having attempted to cause the alleged thief to pay that amount, while the accused is entirely exempt.",
            "But <b>if they were rendered conspiring witnesses</b> only with regard to their testimony <b>concerning the slaughter,</b> their testimony about the theft remains valid. Consequently, the thief <b>pays</b> the <b>double payment, and</b> the witnesses <b>pay</b> a twofold or <b>threefold payment</b> for having attempted to cause the thief to pay this amount, which is the fine for slaughter or sale beyond his double payment.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yosei said: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said when the theft and the slaughter were established <b>by two</b> separate <b>testimonies. But</b> if these matters were established <b>by one</b> single <b>testimony,</b> then even if they were rendered conspiring witnesses with regard to the testimony concerning the slaughter, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the principle that <b>testimony that was partially invalidated is entirely invalidated.</b> When the testimony concerning the slaughter is invalidated the testimony concerning the theft is likewise negated, and the alleged thief is not required to pay the double payment. This concludes the <i>baraita</i>.",
            "The Gemara analyzes Rabbi Yosei’s statement. <b>What</b> did Rabbi Yosei mean when he said: <b>By two</b> separate <b>testimonies, and what</b> did he mean when he said: <b>By one</b> single <b>testimony? If we say</b> that the phrase: <b>By two</b> separate <b>testimonies,</b> means <b>literally by two</b> separate testimonies, i.e., <b>by two</b> separate <b>sets</b> of witnesses, one of which testifies concerning the theft while the other testifies concerning the slaughter, this would mean that the expression: <b>By one</b> single <b>testimony,</b> means <b>by one set</b> of witnesses that testifies to both the theft and the slaughter, <b>one</b> matter <b>after the other.</b>",
            "<b>And</b> if so, when <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> then <b>says</b> that the facts are established <b>by one testimony,</b> he meant <b>one set</b> of witnesses testifying about both matters, <b>one</b> matter <b>after the other,</b> i.e., <b>that they testify concerning the theft and then testify concerning the slaughter.</b> Therefore, <b>when they are rendered conspiring witnesses</b> only <b>with regard to the slaughter,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is determined in accordance with the principle that <b>testimony that was partially invalidated is entirely invalidated. And</b> consequently Rabbi Yosei would maintain that <b>they are</b> considered to have been <b>rendered conspiring witnesses concerning the theft</b> as well. The Gemara asks: <b>From where would this be derived?</b> Why should the earlier testimony about the theft be negated by their status as conspiring witnesses from the later testimony concerning the slaughter?",
            "<b>Rather,</b> is it <b>not</b> the case that when Rabbi Yosei said: <b>By two testimonies,</b> he meant: <b>By a single testimony</b> that is <b>similar to two testimonies.

            "The Gemara continues to analyze the dispute between Rabbi Yosei and the Rabbis: The <i>amora’im</i> discussing this matter <b>assumed that</b> according to <b>everyone,</b> i.e., both Rabbi Yosei and the Rabbis, if a witness pauses briefly in his testimony and then continues to testify, it is considered one long testimony. This is in accordance with the principle that the legal status of a pause or retraction <b>within</b> the time required <b>for speaking</b> a short phrase <b>is like</b> that of continuous <b>speech.</b> Therefore, the two testimonies, the one concerning the theft and the one concerning the slaughter, are considered a single testimony.",

            "<b>Rather,</b> it must be that this case involves another, competing, testimony that is not mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>. <b>Is it not</b> correct to say that the <i>baraita</i> is dealing with a case <b>where</b> prior to the testimonies mentioned in the <i>baraita</i> <b>two</b> other witnesses <b>came and said:</b> The master first <b>knocked out</b> the slave’s <b>tooth</b> and then <b>blinded his eye, in</b> which case <b>the master is required</b> to emancipate the slave and also <b>to give him</b> the <b>value of his eye; and</b> then <b>an intermediate</b> set of <b>two</b> witnesses <b>came and said</b> the testimony quoted in the <i>baraita</i>, that first the master blinded the slave’s <b>eye and then</b> knocked out <b>his tooth?</b> According to this account the master would still be required to emancipate the slave, but <b>he would be required to give him only</b> the <b>value of his tooth,</b> which is much less than the value of an eye. <b>In</b> this case the testimony of <b>the first</b> set of witnesses <b>contradicts</b> the testimony of <b>the intermediate ones.</b>",

It means <b>that what</b> the intermediate witnesses <b>say,</b> i.e., that he owes the value of a tooth, <b>is satisfactory to him,</b> as according to the claim of the first set, he owes the value of an eye. Since there are now contradictory testimonies, the testimony stating the claim of a loss of lesser value is accepted, and in that case the master would have to pay the slave only for the value of his tooth, in addition to emancipating him.

It can be argued, albeit in a far-fetched manner, that the testimony of the first set of witnesses is considered to be to the master’s advantage even at this stage, because he knows what really happened, as reflected in the testimony of the later witnesses.

            "This is <b>as it teaches</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>, that if witnesses say: <b>We testify</b> with regard to <b>so-and-so that he knocked out his</b> Canaanite <b>slave’s tooth and</b> afterward <b>blinded his eye,</b> which requires the master to emancipate him and compensate him for the value of his eye, <b>as that is what the slave says,</b> i.e., this testimony is advantageous to the slave, <b>and</b> subsequently <b>they were found</b> to be <b>conspiring witnesses, they pay the value of an eye to the master.</b>",
            "Abaye analyzes this clause of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>If</b> it is speaking of a situation <b>where the latter</b> set of witnesses, who attested that the first set of witnesses were conspiring witnesses, <b>do not concede that</b> there was any <b>injury at all</b> inflicted on the slave by his master, then there is no testimony to confirm that those injuries were inflicted other than that given by the witnesses who were shown to be conspiring witnesses. Consequently, <b>they should be required to pay the entire value of the slave to the master,</b> as this is the amount of monetary damage the master stood to incur as a result of their false testimony.",
            "<b>Rather, it is obvious that all of them,</b> i.e., both the first set of witnesses and the latter set, <b>concede with regard to the injury</b> inflicted on the slave by the master. They both agree that the master both blinded the slave’s eye and knocked out his tooth and therefore is obligated to emancipate him. They disagree concerning only the order of events. The first set of witnesses said that the tooth injury occurred first and the eye injury occurred afterward. Consequently, they sought to require the master to emancipate the slave and compensate him for the eye injury.",
            "<b>And</b> the second set of witnesses <b>reversed</b> the order of events in their testimony, saying that the eye injury took place first, <b>and</b> in the same testimony, <b>they rendered</b> the first pair <b>conspiring witnesses,</b> by testifying that they were not present when the events occurred. Since the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i> must be interpreted in this manner, it stands to reason that the first case should be explained similarly.",
            "The Gemara analyzes Abaye’s interpretation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And what are the circumstances</b> of the case? The second set of witnesses, who are deemed credible, have established that the injuries did not take place on the date reported by the first set of witnesses. According to their testimony, when did the injuries take place? <b>If the latter</b> witnesses <b>postdated</b> the events, by testifying that the injuries were actually inflicted at a later stage than that mentioned by the first set of witnesses, the first set of witnesses should <b>still be required to pay the</b> full <b>value of a slave to the master.</b>",
            "The reason the first set of witnesses should be liable is <b>that when they</b> sought to <b>impose liability upon the man,</b> i.e., the master, this <b>man was not yet</b> burdened with any <b>liability.</b> When the first set of witnesses testified about the injuries, the master was not yet obligated to emancipate his slave or pay damages. Therefore, these conspiring witnesses should be required to pay these sums, which they had sought to impose on the master. <b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>the latter</b> set of witnesses <b>predated</b> the time of the injuries, by testifying that they were inflicted at an earlier date than that attested to by the first set of witnesses.",
            "The Gemara continues to analyze the case: <b>And if</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the master <b>had not</b> yet <b>stood trial</b> for having injured his slave when the first set of witnesses submitted their testimony, those witnesses <b>should still be required to pay the entire value of the slave to the master, as</b> at the time of their testimony <b>the man,</b> i.e., the master, was <b>not yet liable.</b> The first set of witnesses sought to render the master liable at a time when he was exempt from liability, and therefore they should be obligated to pay him the full value of the slave.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> it must be <b>that</b> the master <b>had</b> already <b>stood trial</b> for having inflicted these injuries, and had been sentenced by the court to emancipate the slave for the first injury and pay him for the second injury. Then, the master evaded payment, and was subsequently brought before another court, where witnesses testified that the first court had established liability for knocking out the tooth first and then blinding the slave’s eye. This testimony was subsequently rendered conspiring testimony by a second set of witnesses, who testified both that the first set of witnesses was not at the scene of the first trial and that the results of the trial were actually reversed, i.e., the master’s liability was for blinding the eye first and then for knocking out the tooth. Since the first set of witnesses, who were rendered conspiring witnesses, sought to increase the master’s liability payment from that of the value of a tooth to that of an eye, they must pay the value of an eye to the master.",
            "Rava sought to infer from this <i>baraita</i> to his opinion that contradiction of testimony is the start of determining that testimony is conspiring testimony. <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said to Rav Ashi: From which</b> case in the <i>baraita</i> <b>is the inference of Rava? If we say</b> that his inference is <b>from the first clause,</b> this is difficult. In the case of <b>the first clause,</b> if it involves three sets of witnesses, as claimed by Rava, <b>is the intermediate</b> set of witnesses <b>contradicted</b> and rejected before they are established as conspiring witnesses? The first set of witnesses testified that the eye injury took place after the tooth injury, whereas the intermediate set of witnesses reversed the order. If so, the intermediate set of witnesses sought to lower the master’s payment from the value of an eye to that of a tooth.",
            "Rav Aḥa continues: <b>Since if</b> the second set of witnesses <b>would not have been rendered conspiring witnesses, the testimony would</b> have been <b>established in accordance with</b> their statement, <b>as the judgment would have been decided in accordance with</b> their testimony. The reason their testimony would have determined the ruling is <b>that one hundred dinars</b> is subsumed <b>within two hundred,</b> i.e., testimony concerning a large sum includes testimony concerning a smaller sum.",
            "Rav Aḥa continues: <b>Therefore, it is the first</b> set of witnesses, who testified that the eye injury occurred last, <b>whose</b> testimony would be considered <b>contradicted</b> and rejected, whereas the testimony of <b>the intermediate</b> set of witnesses would <b>not</b> be considered <b>contradicted at all,</b> as it is accepted in full. If so, this is not a case of witnesses who were rejected due to contradiction and then subsequently rendered conspiring witnesses.",
            "Rav Ashi <b>said to</b> Rav Aḥa in response: <b>Rava maintains</b> that <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the ruling of <b>the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> is stated <b>with regard to</b> a case involving <b>three sets</b> of witnesses, it is logical to assume that the ruling of <b>the latter clause is also</b> stated <b>with regard to</b> a case involving <b>three</b> sets of witnesses, <b>and</b> Rava <b>infers</b> his ruling <b>from the latter clause.</b>",
            "Rava explains that the latter clause is referring to a case <b>where two</b> witnesses, i.e., the ones mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>come and say:</b> The master <b>knocked out</b> the slave’s <b>tooth and</b> afterward <b>blinded his eye, and</b> the court <b>ruled</b> its <b>judgment in accordance with their statement,</b> obligating the master to emancipate his slave and compensate him for the value of his eye.",
            "<b>And</b> subsequently <b>two other</b> witnesses, who were not mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>come and say</b> that the events were reversed: First the master <b>blinded his</b> slave’s <b>eye and</b> then <b>he knocked out his tooth,</b> so <b>that they contradict</b> the testimony of <b>those first</b> witnesses. At this point the master is obligated to emancipate his slave and pay him only the value of his tooth, as this much was required of him according to both sets of witnesses. <b>And</b> then the first pair <b>were found to be conspiring witnesses.</b> Therefore, as the <i>baraita</i> states, <b>the first</b> set of witnesses <b>pays</b> the <b>value of an eye to the master,</b> less the value of a tooth.",
            "Rava reaches his conclusion based on the following reasoning: <b>And if it enters your mind that</b> the <b>contradiction</b> of testimony <b>is not the start of determining that</b> testimony is <b>conspiring</b> testimony, and witnesses who were first contradicted and then rendered conspiring witnesses are not punished as conspiring witnesses, <b>why must</b> these witnesses <b>pay? They were</b> already <b>contradicted from the outset,</b> before they were shown to be conspiring witnesses. <b>Rather, conclude from</b> the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i> that the <b>contradiction</b> of testimony <b>is the start of determining that</b> testimony is <b>conspiring</b> testimony.",
            "<b>And</b> how could <b>Abaye,</b> who disagrees with Rava, refute this proof? He could <b>say to you: Granted, it is impossible</b> to interpret <b>the first clause without</b> the supposition <b>that</b> there are <b>three sets</b> of witnesses involved. The reason is <b>that</b> it <b>is taught</b> with regard to that first clause: <b>As that is what the master says,</b> i.e., this testimony is satisfactory to the master. The only testimony recorded in the <i>baraita</i> is that the master blinded the slave’s eye and then knocked out his tooth. Why would this be considered satisfactory to the master? It must therefore be assumed that this testimony was preceded by another one that was even less advantageous to the master. That testimony confirmed the injuries but placed the eye injury after the tooth injury, which involves greater liability for the master. Finally, a third set of witnesses must have arrived and rendered the intermediate set as conspiring witnesses, so that there are a total of three sets of witnesses.",
            "<b>But</b> with regard to <b>the latter clause, why do I</b> need to explain it as referring to <b>three sets</b> of witnesses? If you say that it is because the <i>baraita</i> states concerning this case: <b>As that is what the slave says,</b> i.e., this testimony is satisfactory to the slave, this does not prove that there is another testimony, not mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>, that is less favorable to the slave than this one.",
            "The reason is <b>that a slave would say anything,</b> i.e., any form of testimony would be favorable to him, <b>as it is satisfactory for him that he should be emancipated.</b> The court’s acceptance of testimony confirming either order of events would result in his emancipation from slavery, and therefore both testimonies are satisfactory to him. Although there is a compelling reason to posit the existence of three sets of witnesses in the first clause, there is no justification to do so in the second clause, and therefore it should be explained as did Abaye, as discussing only two sets of witnesses.",
            "<b>Rabbi Zeira objects to</b> the basic assumption of the <i>baraita</i> that when a master inflicts two injuries upon his Canaanite slave he must indemnify the slave for the second injury. One can <b>say</b> instead that if the master <b>blinded his</b> slave’s <b>eye,</b>"

The verb for “shall be found” is doubled, as the verse states “<i>himmatze timmatze</i>.” Rav derives from the repetition that there are two matters that are found: The double payment is imposed only <b>if it is found</b> [<i>himmatze</i>], i.e., it is revealed that he stole the item, <b>through</b> the testimony of <b>witnesses,</b> and the theft <b>is found</b> [<i>timmatze</i>], as determined <b>through judges.</b> This <b>excludes one who incriminates himself</b> through his own admission.",

But here,</b> in an ordinary case of admission, <b>where</b> there is no impending testimony to incriminate him, and <b>he admits</b> his guilt <b>of his own</b> volition, <b>even Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b> would <b>concede</b> that the thief is exempt from payment even if witnesses subsequently testify that he is liable.",
            "<b>Rav Hamnuna said: Rav’s statement is</b> more <b>reasonable</b> in a case <b>where</b> the thief <b>says: I stole</b> an item, <b>and</b> subsequently <b>witnesses came</b> and testified <b>that he stole</b> that item. In that case it is logical that the thief is <b>exempt</b> from paying the fine despite the witnesses’ testimony, because he at least <b>obligated himself to</b> pay <b>the principal</b> amount via his admission.",
            "<b>But</b> if <b>he says: I did not steal</b> anything, <b>and witnesses came</b> and testified <b>that he did steal</b> an animal, <b>and subsequently</b> the thief <b>says:</b> Yes, I did steal the animal, and <b>I</b> also <b>slaughtered</b> it, <b>or</b> I also <b>sold</b> it, <b>and witnesses came</b> and testified <b>that he slaughtered or sold</b> it, he is <b>liable</b> to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment.

            "<b>Rava said:</b> In this case <b>I have gotten the better [<i>kipaḥti</i>] of the elders of the school of Rav,</b> which is a reference to Rav Hamnuna. The reason is <b>that</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that discusses <b>Rabban Gamliel</b> injuring his slave, he <b>was</b> seeking to <b>exempt himself from any payment</b> whatsoever through his admission, <b>and</b> yet earlier in the Gemara it was said that <b>Rav Ḥisda stated</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>to Rav Huna</b> to challenge Rav Huna’s opinion, <b>and</b> Rav Huna <b>did not answer him</b> that Rabban Gamliel’s case was different because his admission served to exempt him entirely.",
            "The Gemara notes: <b>It was also stated</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> the same opinion as Rav Hamnuna. If a thief says: <b>I stole</b> an item, <b>and witnesses came</b> and testified <b>that he stole</b> that item, the thief is <b>exempt</b> from paying the fine despite the witnesses’ testimony, because he at least <b>obligates himself,</b> through his admission, <b>to</b> pay <b>the principal.

            "<b>Rather, is it not</b> correct to say that by citing the more complicated case, <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>teaches us: It is</b> only in this case, where it is established that the thief <b>stole</b> an animal <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>two</b> witnesses, <b>and</b> it is established that <b>he slaughtered</b> or sold it <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>one witness or based on his own</b> admission, and <b>where he does not obligate himself</b> through his admission <b>to</b> pay <b>the principal,</b> that he is obligated to pay the fine.",
            "The Gemara elaborates: In other words, it is only in <b>that</b> case, where the theft is established based on the testimony of two witnesses, <b>that we say</b> that liability <b>based on his own</b> admission <b>is similar to the</b> testimony <b>of one witness,</b> in that <b>just as when</b> the slaughter is established <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>one witness,</b> if <b>one</b> other <b>witness</b> later <b>comes he joins together with</b> the first witness and together their testimony is rendered a valid testimony of two witnesses and the thief <b>becomes liable</b> to pay, so <b>too,</b> in a case when the slaughter is established <b>based on his own</b> admission, <b>if witnesses</b> subsequently <b>come</b> and testify, he <b>becomes liable</b> to pay the fine, as his admission would not have rendered him liable to pay any payment.",
            "<b>But</b> if it is established that the thief <b>stole</b> an animal <b>and slaughtered or sold</b> it, all <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>one witness or based on his own</b> admission, in <b>which</b> case through his admission <b>he obligates himself to</b> pay <b>the principal</b> amount, <b>we do not say</b> that when witnesses testify subsequent <b>to his own</b> admission it is <b>similar</b> to when they arrive subsequent <b>to the</b> testimony <b>of one witness,</b> and he is liable to pay the fine in both cases. Rather, since in this case his admission would have rendered him liable to pay the principal due to the fact that the theft was not established based on the testimony of two witnesses, it is considered a proper admission, which exempts him from paying the fine.",
            "The <b><i>baraita</i></b> that supports Rav Hamnuna’s opinion is the one cited earlier, <b>as it is taught:</b> If a thief <b>saw witnesses who were approaching</b> with the intent to testify against him, <b>and</b> at that point he <b>said:</b> I admit that <b>I stole</b> an animal, <b>but I did not slaughter or sell</b> it, <b>he pays only the principal. Why do I</b> need the <i>baraita</i> <b>to teach: And</b> the thief <b>said:</b> I admit that <b>I stole</b> an animal <b>but I did not slaughter or sell</b> it? <b>Let it teach</b> a simpler case, in which the thief said <b>either: I stole</b> the animal, <b>or: I slaughtered</b> it, <b>or: I sold</b> it.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> by choosing the more complicated case, <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us: The</b> only <b>reason that</b> the thief <b>is exempt</b> from payment <b>is that he says: I stole</b> the animal, <b>as</b> in that case <b>he obligated himself to</b> pay <b>the principal.

            "The Gemara <b>says,</b> in rejection of this second proof: <b>No,</b> it is possible to explain the reason the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> chose to present this case in a different manner, as it <b>teaches us this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>itself: That once</b> the thief <b>says: I stole</b> the animal, <b>even if he</b> also <b>says: I did not slaughter or sell</b> it, <b>and</b> later <b>witnesses came</b> and testified <b>that he slaughtered or sold it,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from paying the fourfold or fivefold payment. <b>What is the reason</b> for this exemption?",
            "The reason is that <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah that there is <b>a payment of four</b> sheep for a sheep and <b>five</b> oxen for an ox (see Exodus 21:37). This indicates that a thief can be rendered liable to pay, respectively, a fourfold or fivefold payment, <b>but not a fourfold payment</b> for an ox, <b>nor a threefold payment</b> for a sheep. In other words, one should not view the fines as independent of each other, that if the thief is found with the animal he pays as a fine the double payment, and if he slaughtered or sold it he pays a different fine, i.e., the fourfold or fivefold payment. Rather, the fourfold or fivefold payment comprises the principal, the double payment, and an additional two or three times the principal. By admitting to his act of theft, the thief exempts himself from the double payment, and the remaining fine for slaughtering a sheep would be a threefold payment, or a fourfold payment for an ox, which are not mandated by the Torah.",
            "The Gemara proposes: <b>Let us say</b> that the opinion of Rav Hamnuna and Rabbi Yoḥanan is the <b>subject of</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b> As it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>two</b> witnesses <b>testify that</b> some-one <b>stole</b> an animal, <b>and two</b> others <b>testify</b> against <b>him that he slaughtered or sold</b> the animal, and the <b>witnesses</b> who had testified concerning the <b>theft were rendered conspiring witnesses,</b> the thief is exempt from all payment, as <b>testimony that was partially invalidated is entirely invalidated.</b> If the testimony concerning the theft was undermined, the testimony concerning the slaughter or sale is thereby rendered irrelevant. Consequently, the alleged thief is exempt from any payment.",
            "If <b>the witnesses</b> who testified concerning <b>the slaughter</b> or sale <b>were rendered conspiring witnesses,</b> but the testimony concerning the theft remains credible, the thief <b>pays</b> the <b>double payment, and</b> the conspiring witnesses <b>pay a threefold payment,</b> as that is the loss they sought to impose on the thief. The Sages <b>said in the name of Sumakhos:</b> The witnesses <b>pay</b> the <b>double payment, and</b> the thief <b>pays a threefold payment for an ox and a twofold</b> payment <b>for a ram.</b> This concludes the <i>baraita</i>.",
            "The Gemara analyzes the statement of Sumakhos: <b>To which</b> clause in the <i>baraita</i> <b>is Sumakhos referring? If we say</b> that he is referring <b>to the first clause,</b> in which the testimony concerning the theft is invalidated, this is impossible. <b>Doesn’t Sumakhos</b> accept the principle that <b>testimony that was partially invalidated is entirely invalidated,</b> in this case rendering the testimony concerning the slaughter or sale irrelevant if there is no testimony concerning the theft?",
            "<b>But rather,</b> he must be referring <b>to the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>, in which the testimony concerning the slaughter or sale is invalidated. This, too, is impossible, as in this case <b>the Rabbis,</b> i.e., the first <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>say well,</b> i.e., what they state is reasonable, <b>and</b> the thief <b>pays</b> the <b>double payment and</b> the witnesses <b>pay a threefold payment.</b> On what basis would Sumakhos dispute this ruling?",
            "<b>Rather,</b> it must be that Sumakhos is referring to a different case entirely, one that is not mentioned explicitly in the <i>baraita</i>, and <b>a different matter is</b> at the core of the dispute <b>between them.</b> Sumakhos is referring to a case <b>where two</b> people <b>come</b> and <b>say to</b> the thief: <b>You stole</b> an animal.

            "<b>And</b> Sumakhos and the Rabbis <b>disagree over</b> whether <b>an admission to</b> the <b>slaughter</b> of a stolen animal is a valid admission, even though it does not lead to liability to pay any payment. Both parties to the dispute agree that the admission of a perpetrator only in response to the testimony of witnesses is not a valid admission.",
            "The dispute between them is <b>that the Rabbis maintain that even though</b> the thief’s <b>admission concerning</b> the <b>theft</b> itself is not a valid admission because it is <b>due</b> only <b>to the witnesses</b> who have testified against him that <b>he admits</b> his guilt, nevertheless, his <b>admission concerning</b> the <b>slaughter</b> of the animal <b>is</b> a valid <b>admission,</b> despite the fact it does not render the thief liable to pay a fine, <b>and</b> he is therefore <b>exempt</b> from the fourfold or fivefold payment. The conspiring witnesses must pay the double payment to the thief, since this is the amount of financial damage they sought to impose on him, while the thief pays the double payment to the owner, as valid witnesses ultimately testified that he stole the animal.",
            "<b>And Sumakhos maintains</b> that <b>since</b> the <b>admission concerning</b> the <b>theft</b> itself is not a valid admission because it was <b>due</b> only <b>to</b> the testimony of the <b>witnesses that he admits</b> his guilt, so too, the admission <b>concerning</b> the <b>slaughter is not</b> a valid <b>admission,</b> because it does not obligate him to pay a fine, as stated by Rav Hamnuna and Rabbi Yoḥanan.",
            "<b>And</b> consequently, <b>those first witnesses</b> to the theft, <b>who were rendered conspiring witnesses, pay</b> the <b>double payment,</b> as that is the amount of financial damage they sought to impose on him, <b>and</b> the thief <b>pays</b> the double payment to the owner of the animal, as valid witnesses ultimately testified that he stole it, and since his admission is invalid he must pay an additional <b>threefold</b> payment, for a total of a fivefold payment <b>for an ox, or a twofold</b> payment, for a total of a fourfold payment, <b>for a ram.</b> If this is their dispute, Sumakhos is in agreement with the opinion of Rav Hamnuna and Rabbi Yoḥanan, while the Rabbis disagree with this opinion.",
            "<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said: No;</b> it is possible to explain the <i>baraita</i> differently, as follows: <b>Everyone,</b> i.e., both Sumakhos and the Rabbis, maintains that <b>an admission concerning</b> the <b>slaughter</b> of a stolen animal <b>is not</b> a valid <b>admission,</b> as it does not render the perpetrator liable to pay any payment.",
            "<b>Rather, they disagree over</b> the concept of <b>testimony that you cannot render conspiratory</b> testimony.

            "<b>And Sumakhos maintains</b> that <b>testimony that you cannot render conspiratory</b> testimony <b>is</b> nevertheless considered valid <b>testimony.</b> Therefore, the testimony of so-and-so and so-and-so is valid, and the thief must pay the fourfold or fivefold payment. Sumakhos states that the thief pays a threefold payment for an ox and a twofold payment for a ram. The reason is that the thief receives a double payment from the first, conspiring witnesses, which he gives to the owner of the animal, along with the remainder of the payment. This amounts to a threefold payment for an ox and twofold payment for a ram that he is required to pay from his own funds.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But do we not maintain</b> as an accepted principle <b>that testimony that you cannot render conspiratory</b> testimony <b>is not</b> valid <b>testimony?</b> It is not reasonable to suggest that Sumakhos would disagree with that principle. The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> statement <b>applies</b> in a case <b>where</b> witnesses say <b>that they do not know on which day</b> or <b>at which time</b> of day the events in question occurred, in which case no one could ever say to them: You were in a different place at that time, thereby rendering them conspiring witnesses. With regard to such a case one can say <b>that</b> in effect <b>there is no testimony at all,</b> as the vague statement of the witnesses does not allow them to be prosecuted as conspiring witnesses. <b>But here</b> the thief is <b>supporting</b> their testimony, which renders it more credible.",

Therefore, the animal’s consecration is not tantamount to a sale to another party.",

            "§ The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> In the case of sacrificial animals for which the owner bears financial responsibility to replace with another animal if one of the original animals that one stole is lost or dies, the thief is obligated to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment if he slaughters one of the animals. If it is a sacrificial animal for which the owner bears no financial responsibility, the thief is exempt from the fourfold or fivefold payment. At this stage the Gemara assumes that Rabbi Shimon requires the fourfold or fivefold payment as a fine for the act of consecration itself rather than for the act of slaughtering the animal. The Gemara <b>says: Although Rabbi Shimon holds</b> that there is a logic of: <b>What</b> difference <b>is it to me</b> if <b>he sold</b> the animal <b>to an ordinary</b> person and <b>what</b> difference <b>is it to me</b> if <b>he sold it to Heaven</b> via consecration, nevertheless, he <b>should have</b> said <b>the opposite.</b>",

In other words, if the thief stole a non-sacred animal and subsequently consecrated it as an offering in such a manner that he bears responsibility to replace it, he should be exempt from the fourfold or fivefold payment for the act of consecration.

            "The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> is not discussing the issue of whether the consecration of an animal is tantamount to its sale. Rather, <b>he is referring to a different matter,</b> one that is not explicitly mentioned in the mishna.",

The reason is as it is written: “If a man gives his neighbor money or vessels to safeguard <b>and it was stolen from the house of the man,</b> if the thief shall be found he shall pay double” (Exodus 22:6). The phrase “from the house of the man” indicates that a thief is obligated to pay the double payment only when they are stolen from a person, <b>but not</b> if the item in question was stolen <b>out of</b> the <b>house of the Temple</b> treasury.",

The owner had designated the animal as his offering, and it was in fact used for that purpose. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Avin said</b> in response: This is referring to a situation <b>where the</b> animal’s <b>blood was spilled</b> before it could be sprinkled on the altar. Consequently, the owner did not achieve atonement through this offering, which is why it is not considered as though the animal has been returned to the owner.",

            "<b>Rabbi Elazar wondered about this</b> discussion: <b>According to</b> the explanations attributed to <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> which are based on the assumption that this is referring to slaughtering a sacrificial animal inside the Temple, is it the <b>slaughtering</b> of the animal that <b>renders</b> it <b>permitted</b> for consumption? <b>But isn’t it</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood that <b>renders</b> it <b>permitted?</b> It is prohibited to eat sacrificial meat immediately after the slaughter; only after the sprinkling of the blood is it permitted to consume the meat.

            "The Gemara comments: Apparently, <b>this</b> following statement <b>of Rabbi Shimon escaped</b> Rabbi Elazar, who asked these questions.

            "<b>How so?</b> If sacrificial meat was disqualified due to the fact that it <b>remained overnight,</b> i.e., after the allotted time for that offering, <b>before</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of its blood, it <b>is not</b> susceptible to <b>contracting ritual impurity of food,</b> as it was never fit for consumption. According to Rabbi Shimon, for an item to be susceptible to contracting ritual impurity of food it must have been permitted for consumption or benefit, either at present or at some point in the past. Sacrificial meat may not be consumed before the sprinkling of its blood, nor may it be consumed if it had been left over after a specific period of time, in most cases overnight. If it was disqualified by being left overnight before its blood had been sprinkled, there was never a time when the meat was permitted. By contrast, if the meat was disqualified by being left over <b>after</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood, it <b>is</b> susceptible to <b>contracting ritual impurity of food,</b> as it was permitted for consumption at some point after the sprinkling of the blood.",

The Gemara answers: This is referring to a case <b>where there was not enough time in the day to sprinkle</b> the blood, <b>as he slaughtered</b> the offering <b>immediately prior to sunset.</b> The blood was never fit for sprinkling, as the act of sprinkling must be performed before sunset. <b>And</b> in this case the meat is <b>not</b> susceptible to <b>contracting ritual impurity of food,</b> as there was never a time when it was permitted for consumption.",

            "The Gemara discusses the relative merits of the answers provided by Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish: <b>Granted, Rabbi Yoḥanan did not state</b> an answer <b>in accordance with</b> that of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish,</b> i.e., Reish Lakish, that the mishna is referring to a blemished animal, <b>because he wants to interpret the mishna</b> as dealing with all kinds of sacrificial animals, <b>even with unblemished</b> ones. <b>But what is the reason</b> that <b>Reish Lakish did not state</b> an answer <b>in accordance with</b> that of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan?</b>",
            "Reish Lakish could have <b>said to you</b> that the verse states: “If a man steals an ox or a sheep, <b>and slaughters it or sells it”</b> (Exodus 21:37). This verse compares slaughtering to selling, thereby indicating that <b>anywhere that</b> the fourfold or fivefold payment <b>is</b> applicable <b>for</b> the <b>sale</b> of a particular animal <b>it is</b> likewise applicable <b>for</b> its <b>slaughter, and anywhere that</b> the fourfold or fivefold payment <b>is not</b> applicable <b>for</b> the <b>sale</b> of an animal <b>it is not</b> applicable <b>for</b> its <b>slaughter</b> either. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>this</b> case of <b>sacrificial</b> animals, <b>since when one sells sacrificial</b> animals <b>it is not</b> a valid <b>sale,</b> and no fourfold or fivefold payment is incurred, so too, <b>there is no</b> fourfold or fivefold payment for their <b>slaughter.</b>",

            "The Gemara answers: <b>It is different here,</b> in the case of the fourfold or fivefold payment, <b>as the verse states “or”</b> (Exodus 21:37), a term that could have been avoided, as explained earlier (67b).

There is more justification for including an animal that resembles another, whose parentage is entirely of one species, than for including an animal of diverse kinds.",
            "The Gemara has established that when the Torah uses the word <i>seh</i> (Exodus 21:37) in the context of theft it does not serve to exclude animals of diverse kinds. The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> what is meant by <b>this</b> statement <b>that Rava says</b> with regard to the verse: “The ox, the <i>seh</i> of a sheep, and the <i>seh</i> of a goat” (Deuteronomy 14:4), that <b>this establishes a paradigm</b> for other cases, teaching that <b>wherever</b> the word <b><i>seh</i> is stated</b> in the Torah, <b>it</b> serves <b>to exclude only</b> an animal of <b>diverse kinds.

            "The Gemara analyzes the four opinions of the <i>tanna’im</i> presented in these <i>baraitot</i>. <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do they disagree? The first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that when the Torah states: “If a man steals an ox or a sheep, and slaughters it or sells it, he shall pay five oxen for an ox and four sheep for a sheep” (Exodus 21:37), the term <b>“and slaughters it”</b> indicates that <b>we require</b> him to slaughter <b>all of it</b> for him to incur liability to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment.

            "<b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds</b> that the term <b>“and slaughters it”</b> is referring to <b>parts</b> of the animal <b>that are</b> affected <b>by</b> its <b>slaughter,</b> which serves <b>to exclude parts</b> of the animal <b>that are not</b> affected <b>by</b> its <b>slaughter.</b> When the Torah immediately adds the term <b>“or sells it,”</b> this indicates that selling is <b>similar to slaughter.</b> Consequently, if the sale excludes the animal’s fleece or horns, i.e., those parts that are not affected by slaughter, there is still fourfold or fivefold payment.",
            "<b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar holds,</b> according to the first version of his opinion, that <b>the</b> animal’s <b>horn, which is not meant to be cut off</b> in the animal’s lifetime, <b>is</b> considered a significant <b>withholding</b> if the thief keeps that part for himself, <b>and he does not pay</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment.</b> By contrast, <b>fleece, which is meant to be cut off</b> in the animal’s lifetime, <b>is not</b> considered a significant <b>withholding</b> if the thief keeps it for himself, <b>and</b> therefore <b>he must pay</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment.</b>",
            "<b>And the other <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar holds</b> that the animal’s <b>forelegs and hind legs, which require slaughter</b> for them to be put to their usual use, i.e., for eating, <b>are</b> considered a significant <b>withholding</b> if the thief keeps one of them for himself, <b>and</b> consequently <b>he does not pay</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment.</b> By contrast, <b>its horns and its fleece, which do not require slaughter</b> in order to be used, <b>are not</b> considered a significant <b>withholding</b> if the thief keeps them for himself.",
            "The Gemara asks: This presents <b>a difficulty,</b> as there is a contradiction between one statement <b>of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar and</b> another opinion presented in the name <b>of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar.</b> The Gemara answers: The two rulings represent the reports of <b>two <i>tanna’im</i>, and</b> they disagree <b>with regard to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar.</b>",
            "<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who steals</b> an animal that is <b>missing a limb, or</b> that is <b>lame, or</b> that is <b>blind,</b> and he subsequently sold it, <b>and similarly, one who steals an animal</b> belonging to several <b>partners</b> and he subsequently sold it, is <b>liable</b> to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment. <b>But</b> several <b>partners who stole</b> an animal together and sell it are <b>exempt</b> from the fourfold or fivefold payment.

            "The Gemara resolves the contradiction: <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that this is <b>not difficult.

To counter this, <b>the verse states: “And slaughters it,”</b> which indicates that <b>we require</b> liability for slaughtering <b>all of it, and</b> in these cases <b>it is not</b> so.

Likewise, when several partners steal an animal, the one who slaughters it is not liable for slaughtering the portions of his fellow thieves.",

Consequently, the one slaughtering is acting solely on his own and is not liable for the slaughter of his partner’s share, which is why he is exempt from any payment.",
            "§ <b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises</b> several <b>dilemmas:</b> If the thief <b>sold</b> the animal <b>except for thirty days,</b> i.e., the thief reserved the right to use the animal himself for thirty days before the sale takes effect, what is the <i>halakha</i>? If he sold it <b>except for its work,</b> i.e., he stipulated with the buyer that any work the animal performs would be for the thief’s own benefit and profit, what is the <i>halakha</i>? If he stole a pregnant animal and sold it <b>except for its fetus, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?",
            "The Gemara elaborates on the last dilemma: <b>According to the one who says that a fetus is</b> considered as <b>its mother’s thigh,</b> i.e., a part of its mother, <b>you should not raise the dilemma, as</b> it is clear that the thief, by retaining the fetus, <b>has withheld</b> part <b>of</b> the animal. <b>When you should raise the dilemma,</b> it is <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>the one who says that a fetus is not</b> considered as <b>its mother’s thigh,</b> i.e., it has the status of an independent being. <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in this case? <b>Do we say that since it is</b> in fact <b>attached</b> to the mother, if the thief keeps the fetus for himself <b>it is</b> considered a significant <b>withholding? Or perhaps, since it stands to become detached from</b> the mother <b>it is not</b> considered a significant <b>withholding?</b>",
            "<b>There are</b> those <b>who state</b> a different analysis of this dilemma: <b>Since</b> a fetus is <b>not</b> considered as <b>its mother’s thigh, it is not</b> considered a significant <b>withholding, or perhaps, since</b> it needs its mother <b>to be rendered permitted</b> for consumption <b>through</b> the mother’s <b>slaughter, it is considered as though</b> the thief <b>has withheld a part of the</b> mother’s <b>body.</b> The Gemara concludes: All these dilemmas <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.",
            "<b>Rav Pappa raises a dilemma:</b> If one <b>stole</b> an animal, <b>severed</b> one of its limbs, <b>and</b> then <b>sold it, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say</b> that the essential factor is that part of <b>what he stole he has not sold,</b> as the missing limb was not sold, and therefore he is exempt from the fourfold or fivefold payment? <b>Or perhaps</b> the essential factor is that with regard to that <b>which he sold he has not withheld</b> any part for himself. Once again, the Gemara states that this dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.",
            "§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>stole</b> an animal <b>and gave it to another and</b> that person <b>slaughtered it</b> for him, or if <b>he stole</b> an animal <b>and gave it to another and</b> that person <b>sold it</b> for him, the thief is liable to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment, as performing these actions through an agent is equivalent to performing them by oneself."

            "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is this <i>baraita</i> <b>teaching us?</b> All of the <i>halakhot</i> it states are obvious. The Gemara answers: <b>The first clause teaches us,</b> through the case of one who <b>stole</b> an animal <b>and gave it to another and</b> that person <b>slaughtered</b> or sold it on his behalf, <b>that</b> in this case <b>there is agency for transgression. Even though in the entire Torah</b> there is a principle that <b>there is no agency for transgression, here there is agency for transgression.</b> The Torah’s principle is that a transgression committed by an agent who was appointed by another person is not considered the act of the one who appointed the agent, but the independent act of the agent himself. The case discussed by this <i>baraita</i> is an exception to the rule, as here, the agent’s slaughter or sale of the animal is legally considered the action of the thief.",
            "<b>What</b> is <b>the reason</b> that this case is an exception to the principle? It is because the verse states: <b>“And slaughters it or sells it”</b> (Exodus 21:37), which juxtaposes the two acts of slaughtering and selling. This teaches that <b>just as</b> one becomes liable for <b>selling, which</b> by definition <b>is impossible without another</b> party, i.e., the buyer, <b>so too one becomes liable</b> for <b>slaughtering</b> even when it is <b>by means of another</b> party, i.e., when the thief instructs another person to slaughter the animal on his behalf.",
            "<b>And the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> a novelty in the case of one who <b>stole</b> an animal <b>and consecrated</b> it. The novelty is that this is considered a sale despite the fact that there is no purchaser. This is due to the following argument: <b>What</b> difference <b>is it to me</b> if <b>he sold</b> the animal <b>to an ordinary</b> person, and <b>what</b> difference <b>is it to me</b> if <b>he sold it to Heaven</b> by consecrating it? If the animal changes ownership, it is considered a sale, and it does not matter if the new owner is an ordinary person or the Temple treasury.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one <b>stole</b> an animal <b>in</b> its <b>owner’s domain,</b> i.e., he took hold of it or established control over it but had not yet removed it from the owner’s premises, <b>and</b> then <b>he slaughtered</b> it <b>or sold</b> it <b>outside</b> of the owner’s <b>domain; or</b> if <b>he stole</b> an animal <b>outside</b> of the owner’s <b>domain and slaughtered</b> it <b>or sold</b> it <b>in</b> the owner’s <b>domain; or</b> if <b>he stole</b> an animal <b>and slaughtered</b> it <b>or sold</b> it, and all of this occurred <b>outside</b> the owner’s <b>domain,</b> in all of these cases, <b>he must pay</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment. But</b> if <b>he stole</b> it <b>and slaughtered or sold</b> it, and all of this occurred <b>in</b> the owner’s <b>domain,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from any of the fines for theft, as it is not considered theft until the stolen object is actually removed from the owner’s premises.",
            "If the thief <b>was</b> in the process of <b>leading</b> the animal <b>and leaving</b> the owner’s premises, <b>and it died</b> while it was still <b>in the owner’s domain,</b> the thief is <b>exempt</b> from all fines. If <b>he lifted it up or led it out of</b> the <b>owner’s domain and</b> then the animal <b>died,</b> he is <b>liable</b> for his theft. For an act to be considered theft, the thief must acquire the item by pulling it or moving it, which are ineffective forms of acquisition on the owner’s premises; or by lifting it up, which is effective even when performed in the owner’s domain.",

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Ameimar raises a dilemma:</b> Did the Sages <b>institute</b> the requirement of <b>pulling</b> or leading an animal <b>with regard to bailees, or not?</b> When an animal or other item is purchased, the parties to the sale are not bound by the deal until the purchaser performs an act of acquisition, one of which is pulling the animal or leads it along. Did the Sages institute an ordinance that the same applies to bailees? In other words, does the bailee’s obligation to safeguard the animal or item begin as soon as he consents to watch it, or only after he has taken the animal and moved it even minimally?",
            "<b>Rav Yeimar said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the mishna: If the thief <b>gave</b> the animal as payment <b>for the redemption of his firstborn son, or</b> as payment <b>to a creditor,</b> or conveyed it for safeguarding <b>to an unpaid bailee,</b> or lent it <b>to a borrower,</b> or conveyed it for safeguarding <b>to a paid bailee, or</b> rented it <b>to a renter, and he was leading out</b> the animal <b>and it died in the owner’s domain,</b> the thief is <b>exempt</b> from payment. <b>What, is it not</b> talking about the <b>bailee</b> leading out the animal, when it states that the thief is exempt? <b>And</b> if so, <b>conclude from</b> this mishna that the Sages <b>instituted</b> the requirement of <b>pulling with regard to bailees.</b> If the bailee’s obligation begins immediately upon his consent to watch over the item, it would be considered stolen by the thief at that stage, even before the bailee moves it.",
            "Ameimar <b>said to</b> Rav Yeimar: <b>No,</b> this is not necessarily the correct interpretation of the mishna. The mishna may mean that the owner gave the animal to his creditor or to a bailee, and subsequently a thief came to steal it from the house of the creditor or the bailee, and it was the <b>thief</b> who was leading the animal out of those premises when it died.",
            "Rav Yeimar asked: How can that clause of the mishna refer to an animal that died as the thief was leading it out? The mishna already <b>taught this</b> <i>halakha</i> in <b>the first clause.</b> Ameimar answered: Nevertheless, it is possible that the mishna <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>a thief who stole</b> an animal <b>from its owner’s house, and</b> then <b>taught</b> it again with regard to <b>a thief who stole</b> an animal <b>from a bailee’s house.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Ashi said to</b> Ameimar: <b>Do not reject</b> Rav Yeimar’s argument by means of this alternative interpretation of the mishna.

Therefore, the mishna would not have discussed both of them.",
            "<b>Rather, is it not</b> more reasonable to say that the mishna should be interpreted as meaning that the <b>bailee</b> was leading the animal out of the owner’s house at the behest of the thief, as Rav Yeimar claimed? <b>And</b> therefore, one should <b>conclude from</b> the mishna that the Sages <b>instituted</b> the requirement of <b>pulling with regard to bailees.</b> The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from</b> the mishna that they did. <b>It was also stated</b> explicitly that <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Just as</b> the Sages <b>instituted</b> the requirement of <b>pulling with regard to purchasers, so too</b> they <b>instituted</b> the requirement of <b>pulling with regard to bailees.</b>",

Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai <b>said to them</b> in response: <b>This one,</b> the robber, <b>equated the honor of</b> the <b>servant to the honor of his Master, and that one,</b> the thief, <b>did not equate the honor of</b> the <b>servant to the honor of his Master.</b> The robber fears neither God nor people, as he is not afraid to rob in public.

            "The next item on the list of conditions is: <b>And they</b> shall have the right to <b>veer off to the sides of the roads</b> onto private property <b>because of hard protrusions of the road.</b> The Gemara relates: <b>Shmuel and Rav Yehuda,</b> who lived in Babylonia, <b>were</b> once <b>walking along the road,</b> and <b>Shmuel veered off to the sides of the road</b> onto private property. <b>Rav Yehuda said to him:</b> Do the <b>conditions that Joshua stipulated</b> apply <b>even in Babylonia?</b> Shmuel <b>said to him:</b> Indeed so, <b>as I say</b> that they apply <b>even outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael.",

The Gemara answers: That is taught <b>lest you say</b> that it is only <b>another</b> person who is permitted to cut down branches, <b>as,</b> having seen the lost party, <b>he knows</b> exactly <b>where he is going</b> to rescue the other and help him leave the vineyard, and <b>that</b> is why <b>he may cut down branches; but</b> with regard to the lost person himself, <b>who does not know where he is going,</b> one might have said that <b>he may not cut down branches</b> but must <b>go</b> all the way <b>back to the boundary</b> of the vineyard. The <i>baraita</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that one who is lost may cut down branches in his quest to find his own way to the nearby town or road.",
            "The Gemara asks a further question: Why was it necessary for Joshua to stipulate that one may find his way out in this manner? After all, <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> applies <b>by Torah law.</b> When one is lost, whoever can assist in helping him find his way must do so by Torah law, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There is a mitzva to return lost items to their owner. <b>From where</b> is it derived that the requirement applies even to <b>returning his body,</b> i.e., helping a lost person find his way? <b>The verse states: “And you shall restore it</b> to him” (Deuteronomy 22:2), which can also be translated as: And you shall restore himself to him. If this is required by Torah law, why did Joshua stipulate a condition to this effect?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>By Torah law</b> one is required only to walk in a roundabout path <b>along the boundaries,</b> without damaging another’s vines by cutting off branches. Joshua <b>came and instituted</b> the stipulation <b>that one may</b> go even further and <b>cut off branches and ascend</b> or <b>cut off branches and descend,</b> thereby leaving through the most direct route.",
            "The Gemara addresses the last stipulation in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> that <b>a corpse with no one to bury it [<i>met mitzva</i>] acquires its place</b> and is buried where it was found. The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who finds a corpse laid out on a main street [<i>isratya</i>] evacuates it</b> for burial either <b>to the right of the street or to the left of the street,</b> but it may not be buried under the main street itself.

            "<b>Rav Beivai said:</b> The ruling of this <i>baraita</i> is stated <b>with regard to</b> a corpse <b>laid out on the pathway.</b> Were the corpse buried there, it would prohibit passage by priests. <b>Since permission was</b> already <b>granted to evacuate it</b> from there, <b>one may evacuate it to any place he wishes.</b> If, however, the corpse was in a field, it would be prohibited to move it.",
            "§ The Gemara returns to the opening statement of the <i>baraita</i>, that Joshua stipulated ten conditions. The Gemara <b>says:</b> Are there really only <b>ten? These</b> conditions enumerated in the <i>baraita</i> <b>are</b> actually <b>eleven.</b> The Gemara answers: The condition that <b>one may walk in permitted paths</b> that cut through a private field in the summer was not instituted by Joshua; rather, King <b>Solomon said it.</b>",

The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> an idea <b>like this</b> is found in the Bible, albeit in a slightly different form, as <b>it is written like this: “Withhold not good from him to whom it is due, when it is in the power of your hand to do it”</b> (Proverbs 3:27).",
            "The Gemara further questions the statement of the <i>baraita</i> that Joshua instituted ten stipulations: <b>And is there nothing more</b> that Joshua instituted? <b>But there is</b> also the stipulation mentioned <b>by Rabbi Yehuda.

            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And it is</b> also <b>a stipulation of the court that this</b> bearer of wine <b>pours out his wine</b> from his barrel <b>and</b> uses the barrel <b>to save another’s</b> spilling <b>honey,</b> which is more valuable than the wine, <b>and</b> then <b>he takes</b> the <b>value of his wine from the</b> saved <b>honey of the other,</b> as reimbursement. <b>And it is</b> likewise <b>a stipulation of the court that this</b> owner of wood <b>unloads his wood</b> from his donkey <b>and loads another’s flax,</b> which is more valuable than wood, if the load of flax is stranded on the road due to a mishap, <b>and</b> later <b>he takes</b> the <b>value of his wood from the</b> saved <b>flax of that other</b> individual. Once again, the reason is that it was <b>on this condition</b> that <b>Joshua apportioned Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>to the Jewish people.</b>",
            "The Gemara explains why the stipulations mentioned by Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yishmael are omitted by the earlier <i>baraita</i>: In the <i>baraita</i>, <b>we are not speaking of individual</b> opinions, but only of those that are accepted by all the Sages."

And every day</b> the people inside <b>would lower down money in a box</b> from the Temple walls, to purchase sheep to sacrifice, <b>and</b> those on other side <b>would</b> take the money and <b>send up</b> sheep <b>to them</b> over the wall for the <b>daily offerings.</b>",
            "<b>There was a certain elder there who was familiar with Greek wisdom,</b> and <b>he said</b> to those besieging Jerusalem: <b>As long as they occupy themselves with the</b> Temple <b>service, they will not be delivered into your hands. The next day they lowered down money in a box</b> as usual, <b>but</b> this time <b>they sent up to them a pig. When the pig reached to the midpoint of the</b> Temple <b>wall it stuck its hooves into the wall, and Eretz Yisrael quaked</b> over an area of <b>four hundred parasangs by four hundred parasangs.</b>",
            "<b>At that time</b> the Sages <b>said: Cursed be the man who raises pigs, and cursed be the man who teaches his son Greek wisdom. And</b> it was <b>concerning that time</b> of siege that <b>we learned</b> in a mishna: There was <b>an incident</b> in which the barley for the <b><i>omer</i> offering came from the gardens of Tzerifin,</b> far from Jerusalem, <b>and</b> the wheat for <b>the two loaves</b> of <i>Shavuot</i> was brought <b>from the valley of Ein Sokher.</b> Barley and wheat could not be brought from any nearer because the besiegers had destroyed all the produce around Jerusalem. This concludes the <i>baraita</i>.",
            "The Gemara asks a question with regard to this <i>baraita</i>: <b>And is</b> it really <b>prohibited</b> to study <b>Greek wisdom? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: In Eretz Yisrael,</b>"

The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>The Greek language</b> is <b>discrete, and Greek wisdom</b> is <b>discrete.</b> In other words, these are two separate issues; only Greek wisdom is prohibited, not the Greek language.",
            "The Gemara further pursues this line of inquiry: <b>And is Greek wisdom</b> itself actually <b>prohibited? But doesn’t Rav Yehuda say</b> that <b>Shmuel says in the name of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel:</b> It is written: <b>“My eye affected my soul, because of all the daughters of my city”</b> (Lamentations 3:51). Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel applied this verse to a personal tragedy: <b>There were a thousand children in the household of</b> my <b>father,</b> Rabban Gamliel; <b>five hundred of them studied</b> the <b>Torah, and five hundred of them studied Greek wisdom.</b> All of them were killed by the Romans; <b>and the only</b> ones that <b>remain of them</b> are <b>I,</b> who is <b>here, and the son of</b> my <b>father’s brother,</b> who is <b>in Asia Minor [Asya]</b>.

            "The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>The household of Rabban Gamliel is different, as they</b> held <b>close</b> ties <b>with the government.</b> Since knowledge of Greek wisdom was crucial for the members of this family, the Sages exempted them from the general decree, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one</b> who <b>cuts his hair</b> in the fashion of <b><i>komi</i>,</b> a certain haircut favored by the Romans, <b>this is</b> considered one <b>of the ways of the Amorites,</b> i.e., a gentile practice prohibited by the Torah (Leviticus 18:3). Despite this, the Sages <b>permitted Avtolmos bar Reuven to cut his hair</b> in the fashion of <b><i>komi</i>, because he</b> had <b>close</b> ties <b>with the government.</b> Like-wise, <b>they permitted</b> the members <b>of the household of Rabban Gamliel to discuss</b> matters <b>of Greek wisdom, because they</b> had <b>close</b> ties <b>with the government.</b>",

            "With regard to raising dogs, <b>Rabbi Dostai from Biri expounded:</b> It is written in connection to the Ark of the Covenant: <b>“And when it rested, he said: Return, O Lord, to the myriads of the thousands of Israel”</b> (Numbers 10:36).

The plural form of “myriads” and “thousands” indicates at least two of each. If they are <b>lacking one</b> individual from this total, <b>and there was a pregnant woman among them, who was fit to complete</b> the number by giving birth, <b>and a dog barked at her and she miscarried</b> as a result of the fright, <b>this</b> owner of the dog <b>is found</b> to have <b>caused the Divine Presence to depart from the Jewish people.</b>",

The Gemara asks: <b>And do</b> pigeons really <b>travel that</b> far from their established places? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Batra</i> 23a): <b>One must distance a dovecote fifty cubits from the city,</b> so that the pigeons that settle in the cotes do not eat the crops that grow in the gardens of the city. This shows that the range of a pigeon is only fifty cubits, whereas four <i>mil</i> is eight thousand cubits. <b>Abaye said:</b> Pigeons <b>fly</b> much <b>more</b> than fifty cubits away from their cotes, but <b>their stomachs become full</b> from the food they find <b>within fifty cubits,</b> and therefore they do not eat any more beyond that range.",

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> does the mishna take for granted the fact that one who caused injury is liable to pay compensation to the injured party? <b>The Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“An eye for an eye”</b> (Exodus 21:24).

            "The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>But</b> the verse: “You shall not take ransom for the life of a murderer, for one who is guilty of death” <b>is still necessary</b> to teach the primary <i>halakha</i> taught in that verse, in <b>which the Merciful One states: You shall not take money and</b> thereby <b>exempt</b> the guilty from being put to death. The verse does not serve to exclude liability to pay damages from the prohibition against paying restitution. The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> i.e., if the Torah desires to teach only that the court cannot take ransom to spare the murderer from being put to death, <b>let the Merciful One write</b> in the Torah: <b>“You shall not take ransom”</b> and follow it immediately with the phrase <b>“for one who is guilty of death.” Why do I</b> need the Torah to also state: <b>“For the life of a murderer”?

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And once it is written: “You shall not take ransom,” why do I</b> need the first derivation of the <i>baraita</i>, which juxtaposes: <b>“One who strikes</b> a person” to: <b>“One who strikes</b> an animal”?

            "The Sages <b>say</b> in response: This is <b>not difficult.

            "The Gemara challenges this resolution of the two <i>baraitot</i>: <b>In what</b> manner <b>did you interpret the first</b> <i>baraita</i>?

            "The Gemara continues its challenge. <b>And even according to the one who says</b> that <b>a master can say to</b> his <b>slave: Work for me but I will not feed you,</b> i.e., a master is not legally obligated to provide sustenance for his slave, <b>this matter applies</b> only <b>to a Canaanite slave, as</b> the master can <b>say to him: Work</b> for me <b>the entire day, and at night go around,</b> beg, <b>and eat.

            "The Gemara answers: This is <b>as Rava, son of Rav Ulla, said</b> concerning a similar matter (<i>Ketubot</i> 43a): This <i>halakha</i> is <b>necessary only for</b> the <b>surplus,</b> i.e., money that a woman earns beyond what she needs for her essential sustenance. <b>Here too,</b> this <i>halakha</i> is <b>necessary only for</b> the <b>surplus.</b> If the compensation for injury is more than the daughter requires for her sustenance, the additional sum is paid to her father.",

The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, the verse states: “One from among your brothers</b> shall you set a king over you,” which indicates that the king must be <b>from the choicest among your brothers,</b> which disqualifies both converts and slaves.",
            "The Gemara challenges further: <b>If that is so,</b> then <b>according to the Sages,</b> who hold that slaves are in the category of brothers, a Canaanite <b>slave should be fit to bear witness, as it is written: “And behold, the witness is a false witness, and has testified falsely against his brother”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:18).

            "This is countered: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about a minor?</b> He is notable <b>in that he is not</b> obligated <b>in</b> the performance of <b>mitzvot.</b> Would <b>you say</b> that from the fact that a minor is disqualified from bearing witness one can derive that the same is true <b>for a slave, who is</b> obligated <b>in</b> the performance of <b>mitzvot?</b> The Gemara responds: The <i>halakha</i> of <b>a woman shall prove</b> the matter, <b>as she is</b> obligated <b>in</b> the performance of <b>mitzvot and is disqualified from bearing witness.</b>",

            "This derivation is rejected: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about their common denominator?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> a woman or a minor <b>is not a man,</b> and this is why they are disqualified from bearing witness.

            "The Gemara offers a different derivation: <b>Rather, derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> that a slave is disqualified from bearing witness <b>from</b> that of <b>a robber,</b> who is disqualified from bearing witness.

The difference is <b>due to</b> the rabbinic <b>ordinance of Usha,</b> an ordinance instituted with regard to a husband’s rights to his wife’s property. <b>As Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina says: In</b> the town of <b>Usha</b> the Sages <b>instituted</b> that in the case of <b>a woman who sold her usufruct property in her husband’s lifetime and</b> then <b>died, the husband repossesses</b> it <b>from the purchasers.</b> This ordinance was instituted only for the benefit of a husband, but not for the benefit of a father or son.",

            "The Gemara questions this explanation: <b>Shall we say</b> that this statement <b>of Rava is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>?</b> According to this explanation, the <i>baraita</i> that states that the slave is not emancipated when he is struck by the woman holds that the lien of the husband is not abrogated, which would run counter to the statement of Rava. The Gemara responds: <b>No;</b> it is the case <b>that everyone agrees with</b> the statement <b>of Rava</b> that a lien is abrogated, <b>and here</b> the reason why the <i>baraita</i> holds that the husband’s lien on the slave is not abrogated is that <b>the Sages strengthened the lien of a husband</b> on his wife’s property, and it is only this type of lien that is not abrogated by emancipation.",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead <b>that everyone agrees</b> that <b>these <i>tanna’im</i></b> of the two <i>baraitot</i> <b>hold that there is no ordinance of Usha, and here, they disagree with regard to</b> the question whether <b>ownership of</b> the rights to use an item and to <b>its produce</b> is <b>like ownership of the item itself.</b> In this case, the husband enjoys the usage of the slave while the wife owns the slave himself. The <i>baraita</i> that rules that the slave is not emancipated when struck by the woman holds that the husband is also considered to be an owner, and the <i>baraita</i> that rules that the slave is emancipated when struck by the woman holds that the husband is not considered to be an owner.",
            "<b>And</b> the dispute with regard to the question whether ownership of the rights to use an item and to its produce is like ownership of the item itself is <b>with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute between these <i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who sells his</b> Canaanite <b>slave to another, and</b> he <b>contracted with him</b> that the sale is effected <b>on the condition that</b> the slave <b>will serve</b> the seller for <b>thirty days</b> before he is transferred to the purchaser, the outcome of this sale is that during those thirty days, the original master enjoys the usage of the slave and the purchaser is the owner of the slave.",
            "As detailed in the Torah (Exodus 21:18–21), if one strikes another and the injury leads directly to the victim’s death, the one who struck him is liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment. This ruling does not apply in the case where a master strikes his Canaanite slave and the slave lingers with his injuries for more than a day or two and then dies, in which case the master is exempt from court-imposed capital punishment. The <i>baraita</i> addresses who is considered the owner of the slave with regard to this latter <i>halakha</i>. <b>Rabbi Meir says</b> that during those thirty days, only the <b>first</b> owner <b>is</b> included <b>in</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> of: <b>A day or two days.</b> Rabbi Meir holds that in this case, the first owner is included in this exemption, <b>because</b> the slave <b>is under his</b> authority, as he enjoys the usage of the slave, and <b>he holds</b> that <b>ownership of</b> the rights to use an item and to <b>its produce</b> is <b>like ownership of the item itself.</b> The status of the first owner as the owner also negates the possibility that the second owner would be regarded as the owner with regard to this <i>halakha</i>, and he would not be included in the exemption.",

            "The Gemara questions the assertion that this is the case of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is</b> considered taking an oath to <b>do evil</b> to <b>others?</b> It is considered such if one takes an oath stating: <b>I will strike so-and-so and I will injure his brain.</b> Accordingly, in the corresponding situation of doing evil to oneself it is necessary to explain that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to causing injury as well, and the inference that this is permitted remains.",

            "The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>But perhaps garments are different,</b> in <b>that</b> tearing them <b>is a loss that is irreversible, like that</b> practice <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who would <b>refer to his garments as: My honor, and</b> like that practice of <b>Rav Ḥisda,</b> who, <b>when he would walk among thorns and shrubs,</b> would <b>raise his clothing</b> despite the fact that his skin would get scratched by the thorns. <b>He said</b> in explanation of his actions: <b>This</b> flesh <b>will heal</b> if scratched, <b>but that</b> garment <b>will not heal</b> if torn.

            "The Gemara continues: <b>What is</b> the source that indicates that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar</b> holds that an item that undergoes a change is still considered to have the same status that it had before the change? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 10:2) that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar stated this principle:</b> With regard to <b>any enhancement</b> to the stolen animal in <b>that</b> it <b>was enhanced</b> by the actions of the <b>robber, he has the advantage</b> when repaying the owner. If <b>he desires, he takes his enhancement,</b> i.e., when he returns the animal, the robbery victim must pay the difference between its value at the time of the robbery and its current value, and <b>if he desires</b> he can return it to the owner and <b>say to him: That which is yours is before you.</b>",
            "The Gemara expresses surprise: <b>What is he saying?</b> If the robber has a right to demand compensation for the enhancement to the animal, why would he ever return it without stating this demand? <b>Rav Sheshet said</b> that <b>this is</b> what he <b>is saying:</b> If the robber <b>enhanced it, he takes his enhancement.</b> If the animal was <b>weakened,</b> the robber <b>says to him: That which is yours is before you,</b> and no further compensation is required. This is <b>because</b> despite <b>a change,</b> the changed item <b>remains in its place.</b> Since the robber has not acquired it, he simply returns the item to the robbery victim.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> i.e., if the robber has not acquired it, then <b>even if he enhanced it</b> that should be the <i>halakha</i> <b>as well.</b> The item should still belong to the robbery victim and the robber should not be entitled to compensation. The Sages <b>say</b> in response: The fact that the robber has a right to demand compensation for the enhancement is <b>due to an ordinance</b> instituted <b>for the penitent.</b> In order to ease the burden of one who desires to repent, the Sages instituted that the robber be reimbursed for the increase in the value of the animal. Otherwise, a robber might refrain from returning a stolen item.",
            "The Gemara continues: <b>What is</b> the source that indicates that <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> holds that an item that undergoes a change is still considered to have the same status that it had before the change? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The ideal way to fulfill the <b>mitzva of produce in the corner of the field, which is given to the poor [<i>pe’a</i>],</b> is <b>to separate</b> it <b>from the standing</b> grain, i.e., grain that has not been harvested. If <b>one did not separate</b> it <b>from the standing</b> grain, he <b>separates</b> it <b>from the sheaves</b> of grain that have already been harvested. If he <b>did not separate</b> it <b>from the sheaves,</b> he <b>separates</b> it <b>from the pile</b> of grain, <b>as long as</b> he <b>has not</b> yet <b>smoothed</b> the pile.",
            "If he <b>smoothed</b> the pile of grain, activating the obligation to tithe the produce, he first <b>tithes</b> the grain <b>and</b> then <b>gives</b> a portion of the tithed produce <b>to</b> the poor as <i>pe’a</i>, so that the poor will not have to tithe what they receive. Additionally, <b>they said in the name of Rabbi Yishmael:</b> If he did not separate <i>pe’a</i> during any of the aforementioned stages and he made a dough from the grain, <b>he separates</b> <i>pe’a</i> <b>even from the dough and gives it to</b> the poor. This indicates that even if the grain was changed, one is not exempt from the obligation of <i>pe’a</i>.",
            "The Gemara has now clarified the sources Abaye alluded to when he listed all the <i>tanna’im</i> who hold that despite a change, the changed item remains in its place. <b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: Did all these <i>tanna’im</i> go to</b> so much trouble in <b>an effort [<i>ikhpal</i>] to teach us</b> a <i>halakha</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai,</b> which is presumably not accepted as normative? Abaye <b>said to</b> Rav Pappa: <b>This is what they are saying: Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not engage in a dispute with regard to this matter.</b> All of the aforementioned <i>tanna’im</i> hold that even Beit Hillel agree that a change in the form of an item does not impact its status.",
            "<b>Rava said: From where</b> can it be proven that all of the aforementioned <i>tanna’im</i> hold that an item that undergoes a change is still considered to have the same status that it had before the change? One can say that the reasons for their statements are due to other factors. <b>Perhaps Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda states</b> his opinion, that it is not a significant change, <b>there,</b> in the case of the first of the sheared wool, <b>only with regard to dye,</b> which is a reversible change, <b>since one is able to remove it with soap.</b>",
            "<b>And</b> perhaps <b>Beit Shammai state</b> their opinion <b>there,</b> in the case of a harlot, <b>only</b> with regard to an offering <b>to the Most High, because</b> of the fact <b>that</b> the item <b>has become repugnant,</b> in being used as payment for the services of a prostitute, and therefore it cannot be used for an offering even if its form has changed.",
            "<b>And</b> perhaps <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov states</b> his opinion <b>there,</b> where one robbed another of wheat, <b>only with regard to a blessing, because this is a mitzva</b> that <b>is performed through</b> commission of <b>a transgression,</b> but this does not indicate that a change is insignificant with regard to other matters.",
            "<b>And</b> perhaps <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar states</b> his opinion <b>there,</b> where the condition of the animal changed, <b>only with regard to weakening</b> of the animal <b>that is reversible.</b> Since the animal’s value can be restored by fattening it, the weakening is not deemed a significant change.",
            "<b>And</b> perhaps <b>Rabbi Yishmael states</b> his opinion <b>there,</b> where one separated <i>pe’a</i> at a late stage, <b>only with regard to <i>pe’a</i>, because it is written: “You shall leave</b> them for the poor” <b>an additional</b> time. It is mentioned twice, in Leviticus 19:10 and Leviticus 23:22. One of these terms is superfluous, indicating that <i>pe’a</i> must be given to the poor under all circumstances, even if the grain was changed and made into dough. <b>And if you would say: Let us derive from</b> <i>pe’a</i> that in other halakhic domains the status of an item is not affected by its undergoing a change, <i>pe’a</i> cannot function as a source because <b>gifts to the poor are different</b> from other <i>halakhot</i>.",
            "The Gemara notes: Rava’s claim that no definitive conclusion with regard to the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael concerning a changed item is supported by the statement of another <i>amora</i> is <b>like the dilemma raised by Rabbi Yonatan, as Rabbi Yonatan raises a dilemma: What is the reason</b> for the ruling <b>of Rabbi Yishmael?</b> Is it <b>because he holds</b> that <b>change does not</b> cause one to <b>acquire</b> an item? <b>Or perhaps he generally holds</b> that <b>change</b> does cause one to <b>acquire</b> an item, <b>but here,</b> in the case of <i>pe’a</i>, it is different <b>because</b> the term <b>“You shall leave” is written an additional</b> time.",
            "Having quoted Rabbi Yonatan’s dilemma, the Gemara asks: <b>And if you say</b> that <b>the reason</b> for the ruling <b>of Rabbi Yishmael is that he holds that change does not</b> cause one to <b>acquire</b> an item, <b>why do I</b> need the <b>additional</b> term <b>“You shall leave,” which the Merciful One writes</b> in the Torah? <b>And furthermore, according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who hold that <i>pe’a</i> may not be taken from dough, <b>why do I</b> need <b>the additional</b> term <b>“You shall leave” that the Merciful One writes?</b>",
            "The Gemara responds: This additional term <b>is necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who renounced ownership of his vineyard and arose early in the morning</b> before anyone else took possession of it <b>and harvested it is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>individual fallen</b> grapes left for the poor <b>[<i>peret</i>], and in</b> the mitzva of <b>incompletely formed clusters</b> of grapes left for the poor <b>[<i>olelot</i>], and in</b> the mitzva of <b>forgotten</b> clusters of grapes left for the poor <b>and in</b> the mitzva of <b><i>pe’a</i>.</b> These are the four gifts to the poor that the Torah requires one to give from a vineyard. <b>But he is exempt from the</b> mitzva to <b>tithe</b> his produce, because this requirement does not apply to an ownerless field. The obligation to give gifts to the poor in this case is derived from the additional mention of the term “You shall leave.”",
            "§ The Gemara returns to the discussion of a stolen item that underwent a change. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar,</b> who says that even if the stolen animal deteriorated, it is returned to the owner in its current state.",
            "The Gemara expresses surprise: <b>But did Shmuel</b> actually <b>say this? But doesn’t Shmuel say: One does not appraise</b> the change in value, <b>neither for a thief nor for a robber. Rather,</b> they keep the stolen animal and pay back the victim with their own money; one appraises the change only for one obligated to pay <b>for damage?</b>",
            "<b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rava, who said</b> earlier in response to Abaye: <b>When Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar states</b> his opinion <b>there,</b> he stated it only <b>with regard to weakening</b> of the animal <b>that is reversible,</b> this is <b>not difficult: When</b> Shmuel <b>says</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar,</b> who holds <b>that</b> despite <b>a change,</b> the changed item <b>remains in its place,</b> he stated this <b>with regard to weakening</b> of the animal <b>which is reversible,</b> in which case the change is insignificant. <b>And when Shmuel says there: One does not appraise</b> the change in value, <b>neither for a thief nor for a robber,</b> but rather one appraises the change <b>only</b> for one obligated to pay <b>for damage,</b> he stated this <b>with regard to weakening</b> of the animal <b>that is irreversible.</b>",

            "The Gemara continues the discussion of acquisition of a stolen item due to a change it underwent. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: By Torah law, a stolen item that has changed is returned as is, as it is stated: “And he shall restore that which he took by robbery”</b> (Leviticus 5:23). This indicates that he shall return it <b>in any case,</b> even if it has been changed. <b>And if you say:</b> In <b>our mishna</b> it is stated that if the stolen item is changed the robber gives monetary compensation rather than returning the item, that policy was instituted by the Sages <b>due to the ordinance</b> instituted <b>for the penitent.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But did Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> actually <b>say that? But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with an unattributed mishna, and we learned</b> in a mishna with regard to first of the sheared wool (<i>Ḥullin</i> 135a): If the owner of the sheep <b>did not manage to give</b> the sheared wool <b>to</b> the priest <b>before he dyed it,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from giving it to the priest. This indicates that dyeing the wool is a significant change.",
            "<b>One of the Rabbis, whose name</b> was <b>Rabbi Ya’akov, said to them: It was explained to me</b> directly <b>by Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> that he was referring to a case <b>where he robbed</b> another of <b>sanded wood and fashioned it into vessels, which is a change</b> in which the item <b>can revert to its original state.</b> Consequently, the robber does not acquire the item by Torah law, but rather due to the ordinance instituted for the penitent.",
            "§ Having mentioned the ordinance instituted for the penitent, the Gemara discusses other details of this ordinance. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Shevi’it</i> 8:11): With regard to <b>robbers or usurers that returned</b> either the stolen item or the interest to the one from whom they took it, <b>one</b> should <b>not accept</b> it <b>from them. And</b> with regard to <b>one who does accept</b> it <b>from them, the Sages are displeased with him,</b> since by doing so he discourages those who wish to repent.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This mishna,</b> i.e., the statement of the <i>Tosefta</i>, <b>was taught in the days of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident with regard to one man who desired to repent</b> after having been a thief for many years. <b>His wife said to him: Empty one [<i>reika</i>], if you repent</b> you will have to return all the stolen items to their rightful owners, and <b>even</b> the <b>belt</b> that you are wearing <b>is not yours, and he refrained and did not repent.

            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to children whose deceased <b>father left them money</b> paid <b>as interest, although they know that it is interest, they are not obligated to return</b> it. The Gemara infers: <b>They,</b> the children, <b>are</b> the ones <b>that are not</b> obligated to return it, <b>but their father</b> would have been <b>obligated to return</b> it, and his victims may accept his money.",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>By right,</b> the <i>baraita</i> should have taught <b>that their father also</b> would <b>not</b> have been <b>obligated to return</b> it. <b>And</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to</b> the children is <b>because</b> of the fact <b>that</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>wants to teach</b> a <i>halakha</i> in <b>the latter clause:</b> If <b>their</b> deceased <b>father left them a cow, or a garment, or any</b> other <b>specific item</b> he had stolen or taken as interest, <b>they are obligated to return</b> it <b>due to the honor of their father,</b> so that the item not serve as a reminder to all that their father transgressed. Since this <i>halakha</i> needs to be stated specifically with regard to the children, <b>the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is also taught with regard to them.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> is it true that <b>due to the honor of their father they are obligated to return</b> the item or money? <b>I will read here</b> the verse: “You shall not revile God, <b>nor curse a ruler of your people”</b> (Exodus 22:27), from which the Sages inferred that the prohibition against cursing a ruler is in effect only <b>with regard to</b> a ruler that <b>acts as</b> a member of <b>your people,</b> i.e., in accordance with Torah law. One who curses a wicked ruler does not violate this prohibition. Similarly, if one’s father is wicked, the mitzva to honor him should not apply. Why would his children have to return items that he stole due to his honor?",
            "The Gemara responds: It is <b>like that</b> which <b>Rav Pineḥas said</b> concerning a different case: This is a case <b>where he repented. Here too,</b> it is a case <b>where</b> the father <b>repented,</b> and since he is no longer wicked, his children are obligated to honor him.

The Gemara responds: It is a case <b>where he did not manage to return it before he died.</b> Consequently, the children must return the items in order to uphold their father’s honor.",
            "The Gemara raises another contradiction: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the statement of another <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>robbers and usurers, although they collected</b> the stolen item or interest, <b>they return</b> it.",
            "The Gemara first clarifies the meaning of the <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>robbers, what collection is there,</b> i.e., why did the <i>baraita</i> use the term: Collected, in this context? <b>If they robbed, they robbed</b> and did not collect anything; <b>and if they did not rob, they did not rob</b> and cannot be called robbers at all. <b>Rather,</b> emend the text of the <i>baraita</i> to <b>say:</b> With regard to <b>robbers, and who are they,</b> i.e., what is meant by the term: Robbers? It is referring to <b>usurers.</b> The Gemara resumes its citation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Although they collected</b> the interest, <b>they must return</b> it. This is contrary to the ruling of the <i>Tosefta</i> that if robbers and usurers return what they have taken, it is not accepted. The Gemara explains: <b>Say</b> that this <i>baraita</i> means that <b>they return</b> it, <b>but one does not accept</b> it <b>from them.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But why do they return</b> it if it will not be accepted? The Gemara responds: In order <b>to fulfill</b> their obligation to <b>Heaven.</b> In order to fully repent, they must at least offer to return to the debtors the interest they took unlawfully.",
            "The Gemara raises a contradiction from another source. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the statement of another <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>shepherds</b> who allow their animals to graze in other people’s fields, thereby stealing from the owners; <b>or</b> tax <b>collectors</b> who are hired to collect taxes on behalf of the government and collect excessive sums; <b>or tax collectors</b> who purchase the right to collect taxes themselves and collect unlawfully, <b>their repentance is difficult,</b> since they steal from the public. It is difficult for them to find every one of their victims in order to pay them restitution, <b>and they</b> must <b>return</b> what they have stolen <b>to whomever they recognize</b> as victims of their theft. This <i>baraita</i> indicates that thieves do return what they have stolen.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that <b>they return</b> it, <b>but one does not accept</b> it <b>from them.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But why do they return</b> it if it will not be accepted? The Gemara responds: In order <b>to fulfill</b> their obligation to <b>Heaven.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> if they are not actually obligated to return what they have stolen, <b>why is their repentance difficult?</b>",
            "<b>And furthermore, say the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> as for the money belonging to those <b>that they do not recognize</b> as their victims, <b>they should use</b> that money for <b>community needs.

            "The Gemara adds: <b>And now that Rav Naḥman says</b> that when the Sages say that he does not return what he has stolen, they refer only to a case <b>where the stolen item does not exist</b> in its initial form, and <b>you</b> can <b>even say</b> that <b>this and that,</b> both <i>baraitot</i>, are referring to a time <b>after the ordinance</b> was instituted, <b>and</b> it is <b>not difficult.</b>"

Is it <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that he holds</b> that despite <b>a change,</b> the changed item <b>remains in its place?</b> Despite its changes, the animal always remained in the possession of the robbery victims, and consequently any increase in value belongs to them. <b>Or, perhaps</b> Rabbi Meir <b>generally</b> holds that one <b>acquires</b> an item due to <b>a change</b> in it, and therefore the wool or offspring should belong to the robber by right, <b>but here it is a penalty that he imposes,</b> which forces the robber to return items that are technically his.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>In what</b> case does the reasoning of Rabbi Meir make a practical <b>difference? In</b> a case <b>where</b> the stolen item was <b>devalued</b> since the time of the robbery. If Rabbi Meir’s reason is that despite a change, the changed item remains in its place, it is returned as is, even if its current value is less than what its value had been at the time of the robbery. But if he requires the robber to return the item itself because of a penalty, and by right the robber acquired the animal due to the change, then in this case, where the value decreased, the robber would be required to return what its value had been at the time of the robbery.",
            "The Gemara attempts to find a solution to this question: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> what was taught in the mishna (96b): If one <b>robbed</b> another of <b>an animal and it aged</b> while in his possession, consequently diminishing its value, or if one robbed another of <b>slaves and they aged, he pays according to</b> the value of the stolen item at <b>the time of the robbery.

Certainly,</b> then, <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> one <b>acquires</b> an item due to <b>a change</b> in the item, which is why the robber pays according to what its value had been at the time of the robbery. <b>But here,</b> in the case of the cow that gave birth or the ewe that was shorn, the payment of offspring or wool <b>is a penalty</b> with <b>which he penalizes</b> the robber.",
            "The Gemara continues the alternative explanation. <b>When we asked</b> the question, <b>this is how we asked</b> it: <b>When</b> Rabbi Meir <b>penalizes</b> the robber, is it only for one who robbed <b>intentionally, but</b> if one took an item from its owner <b>unintentionally,</b> Rabbi Meir <b>does not penalize</b> the robber? <b>Or perhaps he penalizes even</b> one who took an item from its owner <b>unintentionally.</b>",
            "The Gemara tries to resolve this question: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Five</b> types of monetary claims <b>are collected</b> only <b>from unsold [<i>meḥorarin</i>]</b> property, i.e., property that is still in possession of its owner and has not been sold in the meantime.",
            "<b>And these are they: Produce, and</b> the <b>enhanced</b> value of <b>produce.</b> Even if one has the right to the produce of a particular property, or the gain accrued from that produce, he cannot claim this payment from liened property. The Gemara continues with the list of monetary claims collected from unsold property: <b>And one who accepts upon himself</b> at the time of his betrothal the obligation <b>to provide sustenance for his wife’s son or his wife’s daughter</b> from a previous marriage; <b>and a promissory note that has no</b> property <b>guarantee,</b> i.e., a document that does not explicitly state that all of the properties of the debtor will serve to guarantee payment of the debt; <b>and</b> similarly, <b>a woman’s marriage contract that has no</b> property <b>guarantee.</b>",
            "The Gemara clarifies: <b>Whom did you hear that says</b> that omission of the <b>guarantee</b> of the sale from the document <b>is not a scribal error?</b> It is <b>Rabbi Meir.</b> There is a dispute between Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis with regard to a promissory note that does not contain a property guarantee. According to the Rabbis, it was omitted in error and is always considered as having been written in the document. Rabbi Meir holds that a promissory note that does not contain a property guarantee cannot be used to collect property that has been liened or sold; it can be used to collect only unsold property. This <i>baraita</i> is therefore in accordance with Rabbi Meir’s opinion. <b>And</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that <b>produce and</b> the <b>enhanced</b> value of <b>produce</b> are collected only from unsold property.",
            "The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances</b> in which he collects the <b>enhanced</b> value of <b>produce?</b> It is a case <b>where</b> one <b>robbed another</b> of <b>a field, and</b> then <b>sold it to another, and</b> the purchaser <b>enhanced it, and it is now leaving the possession</b> of the purchaser because the robbery victim has proved in court that this field is his. <b>When</b> the purchaser <b>collects</b> from the robber who sold him this field, in order to recoup what he had paid,"
        ],
        [
            "he can <b>collect the principal,</b> i.e., what he paid for the field, <b>from</b> the robber’s <b>liened property</b> that has been sold. <b>But</b> he can collect <b>the enhanced</b> value, i.e., the value of the improvements made to the field, only <b>from unsold property.</b> Why are both of these collected from the robber? <b>Because the owner of the field came and took</b> both <b>his land and its enhanced</b> value.",
            "The Gemara clarifies: <b>What, is it not</b> speaking <b>of</b> a purchaser who is <b>an ignoramus, who does not know whether property can be stolen or cannot be stolen,</b> and when he purchased stolen land from the robber, he did so unintentionally, since he was under the mistaken impression that this land belonged to the robber who sold it? <b>And even so, the owner of the land can come and take the land and its enhanced</b> value. <b>And</b> if so, one may <b>learn from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that Rabbi Meir <b>penalizes even</b> one who acquires stolen items <b>unintentionally.</b> The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>No,</b> it is speaking <b>of a purchaser</b> who is <b>a Torah scholar, and he knew</b> that the robber had no right to sell this land. The purchaser is therefore penalized and is required to return the enhanced value of the land as well.",
            "The Gemara again tries to determine the scope of the penalty: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> what was taught in a mishna (100b): If one gave wool to a dyer <b>to dye it red for him and he dyed it black,</b> or to dye it <b>black and he dyed it red, Rabbi Meir says:</b> The dyer <b>gives</b> the owner of the wool the <b>value of his wool,</b> since the dyer violated the owner’s instructions. It can be inferred from the mishna: The <b>value of his wool, yes,</b> he must give; <b>but</b> the <b>value of his wool and its enhanced</b> value, i.e., the amount by which the value of the wool increased because it was dyed, <b>no,</b> he is not required to give.",
            "<b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that Rabbi Meir <b>penalizes</b> one who acquires a stolen item <b>unintentionally as well,</b> the dyer should be <b>required to return</b> the <b>value of his wool and its enhancement to him. Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> the mishna that if it was done <b>intentionally,</b> Rabbi Meir <b>penalizes</b> the robber, but if it was done <b>unintentionally he does not penalize</b> him? The Gemara affirms: <b>Learn from</b> the mishna that this indeed is the reasoning of Rabbi Meir.",
            "§ The Gemara continues its discussion of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: A stolen item is returned as is. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The stolen item <b>is viewed as though it had been monetarily appraised</b> at the time of the robbery. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the difference <b>between them,</b> since ostensibly they agree that the robber does not return the value of the enhancement to the robbery victim?",
            "<b>Rav Zevid says: They disagree with regard to enhancement that is</b> still <b>upon the stolen item.</b> The disagreement concerns a case where the enhancement occurred while the stolen item was in the possession of the robber, and when he returned the item it was still enhanced. Therefore, he did not keep any of the enhancement. <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that the enhancement <b>belongs to the one who was robbed, and Rabbi Shimon holds that it belongs to the robber.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Pappa said</b> that the disagreement between Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon can be explained differently: <b>Everyone</b> agrees that the <b>enhancement that is</b> still <b>upon the stolen item belongs to the robber, and here they disagree</b> with regard to whether the robber can keep <b>one-half,</b> or <b>one-third, or one-fourth</b> of the value of the enhancement, and the remainder is kept by the owner of the animal. <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that the <b>enhancement that is</b> still <b>upon the stolen item belongs entirely to the robber, and Rabbi Shimon holds</b> that <b>the robber takes one-half,</b> or <b>one-third, or one-fourth</b> of the value of the enhancement. In other words, he is treated as a shepherd or rancher and receives the share of the enhancement that local custom dictates be paid to that type of laborer.",
            "The Gemara cites a proof for Rav Zevid’s explanation: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna (93b): If one <b>robbed</b> another of <b>a cow, and it became pregnant in his</b> possession, <b>and it</b> then <b>gave birth;</b> or if one robbed another of <b>a ewe, and it became laden</b> with wool <b>in his</b> possession, <b>and he</b> then <b>sheared it,</b> the robber <b>pays according to</b> the value of the animal at <b>the time of the robbery.</b> The Gemara infers from the mishna: If the cow <b>gave birth, yes,</b> he pays the value of the animal at the time of the theft, but if the cow <b>did not give birth</b> and is still pregnant, it is <b>returned as is.</b>",
            "<b>Granted, according to</b> the explanation of <b>Rav Zevid, who says</b> that <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, enhancement that is</b> still <b>upon the stolen item belongs to the one who was robbed,</b> in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> as the pregnant cow is returned as is. <b>But according to</b> the explanation of <b>Rav Pappa, who says</b> that everyone agrees that the enhancement <b>belongs to the robber,</b> in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna?

            "The Gemara responds: <b>Rav Pappa</b> could have <b>said to you</b> that the inference is incorrect: <b>The same is true</b> that <b>even if it did not give birth,</b> the robber <b>pays according to</b> the value of the animal at <b>the time of the robbery,</b> and the enhanced value due to the pregnancy is returned to him. <b>And that which the mishna teaches: It</b> then <b>gave birth,</b> cannot serve as the basis for an inference pertaining to this discussion. <b>As</b> the <i>tanna</i> needs to <b>cite</b> that <b>it gave birth</b> in <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna, since in that case he acquires the animal due to the change in its condition, therefore <b>he cites</b> that <b>it gave birth</b> in <b>the latter clause as well,</b> but it need not have given birth. It cannot be inferred from this mishna that an animal that has not given birth is returned as is.",
            "The Gemara notes: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the explanation <b>of Rav Pappa.</b> The <i>baraita</i> states: <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The stolen item <b>is viewed as though it had been monetarily appraised</b> at the time of the theft, <b>for</b> the purpose of keeping <b>one-half,</b> or <b>one-third, or one-fourth</b> of the value of the enhancement.",
            "<b>Rav Ashi said: When we were</b> studying <b>in the study hall of Rav Kahana, we were asked</b> a question: <b>According</b> to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who says that the robber takes one-half,</b> or <b>one-third, or one-fourth</b> of the value of the enhancement; <b>when we remove</b> the robber, taking the stolen animal from him and paying him a portion of the enhanced value, do <b>we remove him</b> by paying him his share <b>with money?

            "<b>And we resolved the</b> dilemma <b>from that which Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> In <b>three</b> cases, the court <b>appraises the enhanced</b> value <b>for</b> the parties involved in enhancing a field, <b>and they are paid in money</b> rather than by being given a portion of the property, <b>and these are they: A firstborn</b> son who makes payment <b>to a regular</b> son. This is a case where two sons, one firstborn and the other not, inherit a field from their father. Before it is divided, they both work and enhance the field. When the time comes to divide the field, the firstborn son, who receives a double portion, must pay his brother for the enhancement that the latter contributed to the former’s portion. This payment is given in money rather than land.",
            "<b>And</b> the second case is that of <b>a creditor</b> who is obligated <b>to a purchaser,</b> i.e., a creditor who collects the debt from lands that were sold by the debtor.

            "The Gemara discusses Shmuel’s statement. <b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Did Shmuel</b> actually <b>say</b> that <b>a creditor gives the purchaser</b> any of the <b>enhanced</b> value at all? <b>But doesn’t Shmuel say: A creditor collects</b> all of <b>the enhanced</b> value?

            "Rabba explains the dispute: <b>The Rabbis hold</b> that <b>an ox may not be sentenced in its absence,</b> and therefore the bailee is liable to pay.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause</b> of the mishna <b>teaches</b> about <b>a chest, a box, or a cabinet, it may be inferred that the first clause</b> of the mishna is referring to <b>wood.</b> The Sages <b>say</b> in response: The latter clause <b>is explaining</b> the first clause.

            "The Gemara notes: <b>And so too, it is reasonable</b> to say <b>that</b> the latter clause of the mishna <b>teaches in what</b> case the first clause deems them liable, <b>as, if it enters your mind</b> to think that <b>the first clause</b> is referring to a case where he gave <b>wood,</b> one could ask: <b>Now</b> that the mishna <b>told us</b> that if one gave <b>wood,</b> the craftsman <b>is liable to pay</b> the value of a vessel, <b>and we do not say</b> that <b>a craftsman acquires</b> ownership rights <b>through</b> the <b>enhancement of vessels, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to tell us that if one gave <b>a chest, a box, or a cabinet,</b> the craftsman is liable to pay damages?",

He does not, however, state his own opinion on this matter.",
            "The Gemara offers another suggestion: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who gave his garment to a craftsman,</b> and the craftsman <b>concluded</b> the work <b>and notified</b> the owner that the work was complete, <b>even</b> if the owner delays paying the craftsman <b>from now until ten days</b> henceforth, <b>he does not violate, for this</b> delay, the prohibition <b>of:</b> “You shall not oppress your neighbor, nor rob him; the wages of a hired worker <b>shall not abide with you all night</b> until the morning” (Leviticus 19:13).

It is as if the craftsman acquired the garment, and the payment is considered to be a purchase of the garment by the owner, rather than a wage.",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>Rav Mari, son of Rav Kahana, said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is stating the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to the laundering of a thick garment, where there is no enhancement</b> of the garment. Therefore, the craftsman does not acquire it.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Ultimately, to what</b> end <b>did</b> the owner of the garment <b>give it to</b> the craftsman? He gave it to him in order <b>to soften</b> it. <b>Once he has softened it, that is its enhancement,</b> and the craftsman has therefore acquired it. The Gemara responds: <b>No;</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where</b> the owner <b>hired</b> the craftsman <b>for treading,</b> i.e., to forcefully tread on the garment in water until it softens, with the owner paying the craftsman <b>a <i>ma’a</i></b> coin <b>for each tread.</b> The difference is <b>that this is</b> considered <b>hired</b> labor, where the craftsman is paid based on the amount of times he performed an action, and not contractual labor, where he is paid based on the outcome, in this case, a softened garment.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>And with regard to what entered our minds initially, that</b> the owner <b>did not hire</b> the worker <b>for treading</b> but rather he hired him like a craftsman based on the assumption that the garment would be returned laundered, this <b>supports</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Sheshet.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> based on this statement <b>that Rav Sheshet disagrees with</b> the statement <b>of Rav Asi,</b> who holds that a craftsman acquires ownership rights through the enhancement of the vessel, and his payment is not considered to be a wage? <b>Shmuel bar Aḥa said:</b> Rav Sheshet is discussing a specific type of contractor, and he stated his ruling <b>with regard to an agent</b> tasked with the delivery <b>of a letter,</b> in which case, since the contractor’s only task is to deliver the letter, there is no enhancement through which he might acquire ownership rights. Consequently the prohibition against delaying the payment of wages applies.",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that the statement of Rav Asi, that a craftsman acquires ownership rights through the enhancement of the vessel, is the <b>subject of</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b> As it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: If a woman gave gold to a goldsmith, instructing him: <b>Fashion bracelets, earrings, or rings for me, and I will be betrothed to you</b> as payment for your work, then <b>once he has fashioned them she is betrothed;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.

According to the opinion of the Rabbis, in order for the betrothal to take effect he must give her additional money, while according to Rabbi Meir the betrothal takes effect when he gives her the jewelry.",
            "The Gemara prefaces its explanation of the connection to the issue at hand by delineating two assumptions: <b>And</b> those who say that Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis are engaging in a dispute with regard to the issue of a craftsman acquiring ownership rights through the enhancement of a vessel <b>assumed</b> that <b>everyone</b> agrees that the obligation to pay <b>a wage</b> is incurred continuously <b>from the beginning</b> of the period he was hired <b>to</b> its <b>end,</b> i.e., the obligation to pay for a service begins when the hired party commences work, and the sum owed increases as he proceeds. The fact that he is not paid from the time he commences work establishes the wages as a debt. Consequently, the wages now have the status of a loan. <b>And</b> they also assumed that <b>everyone</b> agrees that with regard to <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with a loan</b> that <b>she is not betrothed.</b> She therefore cannot be betrothed to him by not having to pay the wages for his work.",
            "Based on these assumptions, the Gemara asks: <b>What, is it not that they disagree with regard to</b> whether <b>a craftsman acquires</b> ownership rights <b>through</b> the <b>enhancement of the vessel? As Rabbi Meir holds</b> that <b>a craftsman acquires</b> ownership rights <b>through</b> the <b>enhancement of the vessel,</b> and since he owns the enhanced value of the vessel, when he gives the jewelry to her he is giving her something valuable of his own, and she is betrothed. <b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>a craftsman does not acquire</b> ownership rights <b>through</b> the <b>enhancement of the vessel,</b> and since a craftsman, in this case, the goldsmith, does not own the jewelry, he cannot betroth a woman with it.",
            "The Gemara rejects this explanation of the dispute: <b>No,</b> it is possible that <b>everyone</b> agrees that <b>a craftsman does not acquire</b> ownership rights <b>through</b> the <b>enhancement of the vessel, but here they disagree with regard to</b> the issue of whether the obligation to pay <b>a wage</b> is incurred continuously <b>from the beginning</b> of the period he was hired <b>to</b> its <b>end.</b>",

            "The Gemara suggests another scenario: <b>Rather, with what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where he robbed one</b> person of <b>wool and dyes, and dyed that wool with those dyes, and he is returning the</b> dyed <b>wool to him.</b> The dilemma is: Is the <i>halakha</i> that <b>enhancement</b> which <b>dye</b> provides <b>to the wool is substantive, and</b> he <b>is</b> therefore <b>returning</b> both the <b>dye and</b> the <b>wool to him?

            "The Gemara rejects this understanding of the application of the dilemma as well. The Sages <b>say: Derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> in this case based on the fact <b>that he increased the value</b> of the wool <b>for him,</b> as dyed wool is more expensive than undyed wool. Consequently, even if the robber has not returned the dye, he reimburses the owner for it when he returns the appreciated wool. The Gemara suggests: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to resolve the dilemma in a case <b>where</b> the cost of <b>the dye has depreciated.</b> If the dye is viewed as an independent entity the robber is returning both the wool and the dye. If it is not, he must reimburse the robbery victim for the value of the dye at the time of the robbery. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: The dilemma is relevant in a case <b>where</b> he robbed another of dye and a basket, and <b>dyed</b> the <b>basket with</b> the dye, in which case the dye does not increase the value of the dyed item.",
            "The Gemara presents an alternative understanding of the case where the dilemma applies. <b>Ravina said: With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where there</b> was <b>wool that</b> belonged to <b>one</b> person <b>and dyes that</b> belonged to <b>one</b> other person, <b>and a monkey came and dyed that wool with those dyes.</b> The dilemma is as follows: Is the <i>halakha</i> that <b>enhancement</b> which <b>dye</b> provides <b>to</b> the <b>wool is substantive,</b> so <b>that</b> the owner of the dye can <b>say to</b> the owner of the wool: <b>Give me my dyes that are with you?

            "Having determined the scenario in which the dilemma is relevant, the Gemara proceeds to resolve the dilemma. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution from a mishna (<i>Orla</i> 3:1): <b>A garment that one dyed with</b> dye extracted from <b>peels of <i>orla</i>,</b> i.e., fruit that grows on a tree during its first three years, <b>must be burned,</b> as it is prohibited to derive benefit from <i>orla</i>. <b>Apparently,</b> the enhancement of an item’s <b>appearance is</b> considered a significant <b>matter,</b> and the dye therefore remains an independent substance even after having been absorbed by the wool.",
            "The Gemara rejects this resolution. <b>Rava said:</b> The reason the garment must be burned is not because the dye remains an independent substance. Rather, it is because <b>the Torah prohibited benefit that is visible to the eye, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then you shall count the fruit thereof as forbidden; three years shall it be as <b>forbidden [<i>areilim</i>]</b> to you; <b>it shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 19:23). From this verse <b>I have</b> derived <b>only a prohibition</b> against <b>eating</b> it; <b>from where</b> is it derived that one <b>may not</b> even derive <b>benefit from it, and</b> that <b>one may not dye with</b> dyes extracted from the fruit, <b>and</b> that <b>one may not light a lamp with</b> oil extracted from the fruit?",
            "The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>The verse states: “Then you shall count the fruit thereof [<i>orlato</i>] as forbidden [<i>araltem</i>].</b> Three years shall it be as <b>forbidden [<i>areilim</i>]</b> to you; <b>it shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 19:23), <b>to include all these</b> types of benefit in the prohibition.

This indicates that the dye evidently remains an independent substance.

            "Rabbi Abbahu further explains: <b>Know</b> that the agent is viewed as an extension of the one who appointed him, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Arakhin</i> 24a): Concerning both <b>one who consecrates his property and one who valuates himself</b> by donating his fixed value to the Temple, the Temple treasury <b>does not have</b> any rights <b>with regard to</b> the donor’s <b>wife’s clothing; and not with regard to his children’s clothing; and not with regard to</b> new clothes colored with <b>dye that the</b> donor <b>dyed for</b> his wife or children; <b>and not with regard to new sandals that</b> the donor <b>purchased for</b> his wife or children.

            "<b>And is the intention of a person upon himself</b> to allow the treasurer <b>to seize collateral from him?</b> Presumably not.

Why, then, is the clothing of his wife or children not consecrated?",
            "<b>Rather, Rabbi Abba</b> also holds that the reason the clothing is not consecrated is not due to his intent, and he <b>said</b> a different explanation: <b>Anyone who consecrates his property becomes as one who transferred his wife’s and his children’s clothing to them at the outset.</b> Therefore, the clothing did not belong to him at the time that he consecrated his property.",

            "The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> this mishna, which rules that an agent of the court is an agent even if appointed only by the robber, serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion of <b>this</b> following <b><i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (10:11) that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> If there was <b>an agent of the court who was appointed by</b> the <b>robbery victim but not appointed by</b> the <b>robber, or</b> an agent who <b>was appointed by</b> the <b>robber, and</b> subsequently <b>the other,</b> i.e., the robbery victim, <b>sent</b> for <b>and took his</b> payment <b>from</b> the agent’s <b>possession,</b> the robber is <b>exempt</b> from paying for any accidental damage to the payment during the delivery. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar states that the robber is exempt from paying for any accidental damage when he gave the payment to a court agent he appointed only if the robbery victim sent for and took possession of the payment. This is in opposition to the ruling of the mishna that the robber is exempt whenever he gives the payment to an agent of the court.",
            "The Gemara cites the opinion of two other <i>amora’im</i> with regard to the status of an agent appointed in the presence of witnesses. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar both say: An agent who was appointed in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses is</b> a legally recognized <b>agent. And if you say: Our mishna</b> contradicts this assertion, as it rules that the stolen item is not considered returned if given to an agent of the robbery victim, this is of no concern.",
            "The Gemara explains: The mishna does not mean to disqualify an agent appointed by the robbery victim in the presence of witnesses, but rather is referring to a case <b>where</b> the robbery victim <b>provides</b> the robber <b>with an agent</b> without appointing him in the presence of witnesses, in <b>that he says to</b> someone: <b>I have money</b> owed to me that is currently <b>with so-and-so, and he is not sending it. Present yourself to him,</b> as <b>perhaps</b> he wishes to return it but <b>cannot find a person with whom to send it.</b>",
            "The Gemara offers a second explanation: <b>Alternatively,</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rav Ḥisda,</b> that the mishna is not discussing a case where he appointed the agent in the presence of witnesses, but it is still known that the agent acts on behalf of the robbery victim, as the ruling of the mishna is stated <b>with regard to the victim’s hired</b> hand <b>or his</b> regular <b>harvester.</b> That is why the robber is still liable after having given the payment to the agent.",
            "§ The Gemara discusses another matter relating to the appointment of an agent. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b>"
        ],
        [
            "One who owes a debt <b>may not send money</b> with another to the creditor <b>on the basis of a figure [<i>deyokani</i>]</b> or sign used in place of a signature that is associated with the creditor. The possession of this sign on the part of the other is not sufficient proof that he has been appointed as an agent. <b>And</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even if witnesses</b> verifying that this is the creditor’s sign <b>are signed on it. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: If</b> there are <b>witnesses signed on it, one may send</b> the money with the other.",
            "The Sages <b>say: According to Shmuel, what is the rectification,</b> i.e., what recourse is available to one who wishes to collect a debt without traveling to the debtor’s location? The Gemara answers: One may act <b>like that</b> course of action <b>of Rabbi Abba,</b> who <b>was owed money by Rav Yosef bar Ḥama.</b> Rabbi Abba <b>said to Rav Safra: When you come</b> back from Rabbi Yosef bar Ḥama’s locale, <b>bring</b> my money <b>to me. When</b> Rav Safra <b>went there, Rava,</b> Rav Yosef bar Ḥama’s <b>son, said to him: Did</b> Rabbi Abba <b>write you</b> a document stating: <b>I have received</b> payment, so that my father will have proof that he has absolved himself of the debt? Rav Safra <b>said to him: No.</b> Rava responded: <b>If so, first go</b> to him <b>and let him write you</b> a document stating: <b>I have received</b> payment, and then my father will pay you.",
            "<b>Ultimately,</b> Rava <b>said to him: Even if he writes you</b> a document stating: <b>I have received</b> payment, <b>it is nothing,</b> since <b>perhaps by</b> the time <b>you arrive</b> back here, <b>Rabbi Abba will have died and the money will fall before</b> his <b>orphans</b> as an inheritance, <b>and</b> the document stating: <b>I have received</b> payment, that was written <b>by Rabbi Abba, will be nothing,</b> as the debt is no longer owed to him, but rather, to his heirs. Rav Safra <b>said to him: Rather, what is the rectification?</b> Rava replied: <b>Go,</b> and Rabbi Abba will <b>transfer to you</b> the rights to the money owed to him <b>by means of</b> acquisition of <b>land</b> from him, <b>and</b> then <b>you</b> should <b>come</b> and <b>write for us</b> a document stating: <b>I have received</b> payment. Then, we will pay you.",
            "The Gemara notes: And this is <b>like that</b> course of action <b>of Rav Pappa,</b> who <b>was owed twelve thousand dinars</b> by a resident of <b>Bei Ḥozai,</b> and <b>he transferred</b> his claim to the money <b>to Rav Shmuel bar Abba by means of</b> the acquisition of <b>the threshold of his house. When</b> Rav Shmuel bar Abba <b>came</b> from Bei Ḥozai with the money in hand, Rav Pappa <b>went out as far as Tavakh toward him</b> in his excitement to receive the money.",
            "§ The mishna teaches that if the robber <b>gave</b> the robbery victim <b>the principal</b> value of the stolen item, but did not give him the additional one-fifth payment required of a robber, he is not required to pursue the robbery victim in order to return the additional one-fifth payment. The Gemara comments: <b>Apparently,</b> the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment <b>is</b> considered <b>monetary restitution</b> rather than a fine. <b>And</b> accordingly, <b>if</b> the robber <b>died,</b> the <b>heirs</b> of the robber must <b>pay it</b> to the robbery victim.",
            "<b>And we also learned</b> in the mishna that if the robber <b>gave</b> the robbery victim <b>the principal and takes</b> a false <b>oath</b> to him <b>concerning the</b> additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment, asserting that he had already paid it, the robber <b>adds</b> an additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment <b>apart from</b> the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment about which he had taken a false oath. <b>Apparently,</b> the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment <b>is monetary restitution,</b> as one is obligated to pay an additional one-fifth for taking a false oath only with regard to monetary restitution, not with regard to fines.",
            "<b>And this is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who robs another and takes</b> a false <b>oath to him</b> that he did not rob him, <b>and</b> then <b>dies,</b> his <b>heirs pay the principal and</b> additional <b>one-fifth</b> payments to the robbery victim, <b>but are exempt from</b> the obligation to bring <b>the guilt-offering.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> are <b>heirs obligated</b> to <b>pay the</b> additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment <b>of their father,</b> indicating that <b>apparently</b> the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment <b>is monetary restitution, and</b> therefore the <b>heirs must pay</b> it? <b>But</b> one could <b>raise a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i>. After having stated that one is required to add the additional one-fifth payment only for a robbery he commits himself, and not for a robbery committed by his father, the <i>baraita</i> states: <b>I</b> would <b>still say</b> that <b>when does</b> an heir <b>not pay</b> the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment <b>for his father’s robbery?</b> It is only <b>when neither he nor his father took</b> a false <b>oath.</b>",
            "But if <b>he</b> took a false oath, <b>but not his father;</b> or if <b>his father</b> took a false oath, <b>but not he;</b> or if <b>he and his father</b> both took false oaths; <b>from where</b> is the heir’s exemption derived? <b>The verse states:</b> “He shall restore the item <b>that he robbed,” and</b> “the item <b>that he has acquired through exploitation”</b> (Leviticus 5:23), <b>and</b> in this case the heir <b>did not rob and did not exploit.</b> Since the verse states the obligation to pay the additional one-fifth payment when discussing one who robbed or exploited another, and the heir has done neither, he is exempt from payment. This <i>baraita</i> states that heirs are not obligated to pay the additional one-fifth payment.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that it is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> in the mishna and the first <i>baraita</i>, they discuss a case <b>where</b> the robber <b>admitted</b> his obligation and therefore was required to pay the additional one-fifth payment, and this obligation is transferred to his heir; <b>there,</b> in the latter <i>baraita</i>, it discusses a case <b>where he did not admit</b> his obligation and was never required to pay the additional one-fifth payment.",
            "The Gemara rejects this answer: <b>If</b> the latter <i>baraita</i> discusses a case where <b>he did not admit</b> his obligation, then the <i>halakha</i> would be that the heir <b>would not pay even the principal,</b> as the obligation is not known by anyone. <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>indeed</b> it is so <b>that he does not pay</b> the principal, <b>but</b> isn’t it understood <b>from</b> the fact that the <i>tanna</i> <b>searches for</b> a source to teach the heir’s exemption from only the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment, <b>that</b> it means <b>to say that he does pay the principal.</b>",
            "The Gemara also proves that the heir must pay the principal from the continuation of the same <i>baraita</i>. <b>And further,</b> it <b>is taught</b> in that <i>baraita</i>: <b>And I</b> would <b>still say: When does</b> the heir <b>pay the principal for his father’s robbery?</b> It is only <b>when he and his father</b> both <b>took</b> false <b>oaths.</b> But if <b>his father</b> took a false oath, <b>and not he;</b> or if <b>he</b> took a false oath, <b>but not his father;</b> or if <b>neither he nor his father</b> took false oaths; <b>from where</b> is the heir’s obligation to pay the principal derived? <b>The verse states</b> the following terms: <b>“Robbery,” and “exploitation,” “lost item,” and “deposit”</b> (Leviticus 5:23); and <b>there is a derivation [<i>yesh talmud</i>]</b> here to derive that the heir is obligated to pay the principal in all of these cases.",
            "The Gemara clarifies: <b>And Rav Huna sat and stated this <i>halakha</i>,</b> and <b>Rabba, his son, said to him:</b> Was <b>the Master saying</b> that <b>there is a derivation [<i>yesh talmud</i>], or</b> was <b>the Master saying</b> that <b>they will be paid [<i>yishtalmu</i>]?</b> Rav Huna <b>said to him: I am saying: There is a derivation, and</b> it is <b>from the additional</b> expressions in the <b>verses</b> that <b>I say</b> it can be derived. It is apparent that an heir is obligated to pay the principal, and this refutes Rav Naḥman’s attempted resolution.",
            "<b>Rather, what</b> did Rav Naḥman mean when he suggested that the second <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case where <b>he did not admit</b> his obligation and exempts his heir from paying the additional one-fifth but obligates him to pay the principal? The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case where the <b>father did not admit, but his son did admit,</b> and therefore he is obligated to pay the principal.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> let <b>his son be liable</b> to pay the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment <b>for his own</b> false <b>oath.</b> The Sages <b>say: In</b> the case of the <i>baraita</i>, it is <b>where</b> the <b>stolen item is no</b> longer <b>extant.</b> Although the false oath was taken, it is not the type of obligation for which one must pay an additional one-fifth payment. The Gemara asks: <b>If in</b> the case of the <i>baraita</i> it is <b>where</b> the <b>stolen item is no</b> longer <b>extant,</b> the <i>halakha</i> should be that the heir <b>does not pay even</b> the <b>principal,</b> as the <i>halakha</i> is that while heirs must return an item stolen by their father, they are not obligated to compensate the owner if the item is no longer extant. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the ruling <b>is necessary</b> in a case <b>where there is guaranteed</b> property, i.e., land, which the heirs inherited from the robber. Heirs are obligated to compensate the owner of a stolen item with inherited land, even if the stolen item itself is no longer extant.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> even <b>when there is guaranteed property,</b> i.e., land, <b>what of it?</b> After all, such a debt <b>is</b> legally considered <b>a loan by oral</b> agreement, <b>and</b> the creditor of <b>a loan by oral</b> agreement <b>cannot collect from the heirs</b> of the debtor, <b>nor</b> can he collect <b>from those who purchased</b> land from the debtor.",
            "The Sages <b>say</b> in response:"
        ],
        [
            "The reference here is to a case <b>in which</b> the father had already <b>stood trial</b> and was obligated to pay. In such a case, the debt is considered like a loan with a promissory note, which a creditor may collect from the debtor’s heirs. The Gemara rejects this: <b>If</b> it is a case <b>in which</b> the father had already <b>stood trial</b> and was obligated to pay, then the heir, who took a false oath and later confessed, would have to <b>pay even</b> the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment <b>as well,</b> as this would be akin to any monetary obligation; but the <i>baraita</i> rules that he is obligated to pay only the principal. <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said:</b> The heir is exempt <b>because one does not pay</b> the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment <b>for the denial of</b> a debt that is secured by <b>a lien on land.</b>",
            "<b>Rava said</b> a different explanation: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where</b> the stolen item is still extant, yet the heir is exempt because <b>his father’s sack [<i>disakaya</i>]</b> containing the stolen item <b>was deposited in the possession of others.</b> Accordingly, the heir <b>pays the principal, since</b> the stolen item <b>is</b> extant, but <b>he does not pay</b> the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment <b>because when he took an oath</b> that it was not in his possession, <b>he took an oath truthfully, as he did not know</b> that his father had stolen the item.",
            "§ The mishna teaches that if the robbery victim forgave the robber concerning both payments, <b>excepting less than</b> the <b>value of one <i>peruta</i> of the principal,</b> he need not pursue him in order to return the remaining debt. <b>Rav Pappa says: They taught</b> that the robber is not obligated to pursue the robbery victim <b>only when</b> the <b>stolen item is not extant, but</b> if the <b>stolen item is</b> still <b>extant, he must pursue him</b> to return it, as <b>we are concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the stolen item <b>will appreciate</b> in value, and the debt he owes will exceed the value of one <i>peruta</i>.",
            "<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> <b>is not different</b> when the <b>stolen item is extant, and</b> it <b>is not different when</b> the <b>stolen item is not extant.</b> In either case <b>he does not need to pursue him</b> because <b>we are not concerned that perhaps it will appreciate</b> in value.",
            "The Gemara cites another ruling with regard to a stolen item worth less than one <i>peruta</i>. <b>Rava says:</b> If one <b>robbed</b> another of <b>three bundles</b> of goods that <b>were</b> worth <b>three <i>perutot</i></b> in total, <b>and they depreciated</b> in value <b>and</b> their value <b>stood at two</b> <i>perutot</i>, even <b>if he returned two</b> bundles <b>to</b> the robbery victim he <b>is obligated to return the other</b> bundle. <b>And the <i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna also <b>taught</b> (96b): If one <b>robbed</b> another of <b>leavened bread, and Passover elapsed over it,</b> and it is therefore prohibited to derive benefit from it, the robber <b>says to</b> the victim: <b>That which is yours is before you,</b> and he is not required to pay compensation, despite the fact that the robbery victim has suffered a monetary loss.",
            "The Gemara explains the proof from the mishna: It may be inferred that <b>the reason</b> that he is not required to pay compensation is <b>that</b> the bread <b>is</b> still <b>there in its unadulterated</b> form; <b>but</b> if it <b>is not there in its unadulterated</b> form, <b>even though now it is not</b> worth <b>money, since it was</b> worth <b>money initially,</b> at the time of the robbery, <b>he is required to pay.

            "<b>Rava raises a dilemma:</b> If one <b>robbed</b> another of <b>two bundles</b> of goods that <b>were</b> worth <b>one <i>peruta</i></b> in total, <b>and he returned one of them to</b> the robbery victim, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say</b> that <b>now there is no</b> longer <b>a stolen item</b> in the possession of the robber, as the remaining bundle is worth less than one <i>peruta</i>, and he has therefore fulfilled his obligation to return the stolen item; <b>or perhaps</b> we say that since the robber <b>did not return</b> the <b>stolen item that was in his possession</b> in its entirety, he is obligated to return the second bundle?",
            "Rava himself <b>then resolves</b> the dilemma: <b>There is no stolen item here,</b> as the remaining bundle is worth less than one <i>peruta</i>; <b>there is no returning</b> of a stolen item <b>here.</b> The Gemara expresses surprise at this expression: <b>If there is no stolen item here,</b> as what remains is insignificant, it follows that <b>there is</b> fulfillment of the mitzva of <b>returning</b> the stolen item <b>here,</b> and the robber ought to be exempt, as he is no longer considered to be in possession of a stolen item. The Gemara explains that <b>this is</b> what Rava <b>is saying: Even though</b> the robber is exempt from returning the second bundle, as <b>there is no stolen item here, there is</b> nevertheless <b>no</b> fulfillment of the <b>mitzva of returning</b> a stolen item <b>here,</b> since the returned bundle was worth less than one <i>peruta</i> as well.",
            "§ Following Rava’s previous dilemma, the Gemara cites a similar dilemma raised by Rava. <b>And Rava says:</b> The Sages <b>said</b> that <b>a nazirite who shaved</b> his head as required <b>but left two hairs</b> uncut <b>has done nothing,</b> and his obligation to shave his head has not been fulfilled. <b>Rava raises a dilemma:</b> If a nazirite shaved and left two hairs, and afterward he <b>shaved one</b> of them, <b>and</b> the other <b>one fell out</b> of its own accord, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is this considered shaving one’s entire head or not? <b>Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina: Is Rava raising a dilemma</b> as to whether one can <b>shave</b> his head <b>one</b> hair <b>by one</b> hair? How does this case differ from that of one who shaves his entire head one hair at a time, which is a fulfillment of his obligation?",
            "Ravina <b>said to him: No,</b> a resolution to Rava’s dilemma <b>is necessary</b> in a case <b>where one of</b> the hairs <b>fell out</b> first, <b>and</b> then <b>he shaved</b> the other <b>one. Do we say</b> that <b>now, in any event, there is no measure</b> of hair left on his head that requires shaving, as one remaining hair is not significant, and he has therefore fulfilled his obligation; <b>or perhaps</b> we say that <b>this is not</b> considered <b>shaving, as initially he left</b> the significant amount of <b>two hairs</b> uncut, <b>and now when he shaves</b> a second time, <b>there are not two hairs</b> left for him to shave, and this does not qualify as shaving?",
            "Rava himself <b>then resolves</b> the dilemma: <b>There is no hair here; there is no shaving here.</b> The Gemara expresses surprise at this expression: <b>If there is no hair here,</b> then <b>there is shaving here,</b> as no hair remains. The Gemara explains that <b>this is what</b> Rava <b>is saying: Even though there is no hair here,</b> as only one hair remains, nevertheless <b>there is no mitzva of shaving here,</b> as he failed to shave it all on the first attempt, and the second time he shaved less than the required amount.",
            "§ The Gemara cites another dilemma raised by Rava. <b>And Rava says:</b> The Sages <b>said</b> (<i>Kelim</i> 10:6) that with regard to a sealed earthenware <b>barrel that was punctured and was</b> then <b>sealed by sediments</b> from its contents, the sediments have effectively <b>saved</b> the contents of the barrel from contracting ritual impurity if the barrel were to come into contact with an impure item, as it is once again considered a sealed barrel. <b>Rava raises a dilemma:</b> If one <b>sealed half of</b> the hole, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Do we say that since the hole is not currently large enough to allow ritual impurity to penetrate, the barrel is considered sealed; or perhaps we say that since the hole was initially large enough to allow impurity to penetrate, and it has not yet been sealed completely, the barrel retains its status and is not considered sealed?",
            "The Gemara notes that <b>Rav Yeimar said to Rav Ashi: Isn’t this</b> <i>halakha</i> stated explicitly in <b>our mishna,</b> quoted by Rava above? <b>As we learned</b> in the continuation of that mishna: With regard to an earthenware <b>barrel that was punctured and was</b> then <b>sealed by sediments,</b> the sediments have effectively <b>saved</b> the contents of the barrel from contracting ritual impurity. If it was not sealed by sediments and instead one <b>plugged</b> the hole <b>with a vine,</b> its contents remain susceptible to contracting ritual impurity <b>until he smears</b> clay around the uncovered parts of the hole. If <b>there were two</b> vines placed in the hole in order to plug it, its contents remain susceptible to contracting ritual impurity <b>until he smears</b> clay <b>from the sides</b> of the hole inward, <b>and between one vine and the other.</b>",
            "Rav Yeimar explains: <b>The reason</b> its contents become impervious to contracting ritual impurity is <b>that he smeared</b> clay over the uncovered sections of the hole, <b>but</b> if <b>he did not smear</b> clay over the uncovered sections, the contents would <b>not</b> be impervious to contracting ritual impurity. <b>Why</b> should this not be like the case in Rava’s dilemma? <b>But let it be</b> considered, when one plugs the hole with the vine, <b>as</b> though <b>one</b> had <b>sealed half of</b> the hole, since there is no apparent difference between a hole that is half-sealed and a hole that is partially plugged with a vine. Accordingly, Rava should not have stated his dilemma, as it is clear from the mishna that if the hole is only partially covered, the contents of the barrel are susceptible to contracting ritual impurity.",
            "The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There, if he does not smear</b> clay around the vines, the vine <b>will not remain</b> in place.

            "Several examples of an oath in which the robber admits to the primary feature of a claim were cited in the <i>baraita</i> above. The Gemara analyzes some of these examples. When the robber says: <b>You sold</b> the ox <b>to me,</b> he has asserted that it belongs to him, so <b>what admission to the primary</b> feature of the claim <b>is there?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach this in a case <b>where he said to him:</b> You sold the animal to me, but <b>I did not give you</b> the <b>money, take your ox and go.</b>",
            "When the robber says: <b>You gave it to me,</b> or: <b>Your father gave it to me,</b> he has asserted that it belongs to him, so <b>what admission to the primary</b> feature of the claim <b>is there?</b> The Gemara explains: It is a case <b>where he said to him:</b> It was given to me <b>on the condition that I will afford you satisfaction, and I did not do</b> anything <b>for you; take your ox and go.</b>",
            "When the robber says: <b>I found it straying on the road</b> and I brought it home, <b>let</b> the owner <b>say</b> to him: <b>You should have returned it to me.

            "§ After discussing a false oath taken by a robber in which he admits to the primary feature of a claim, the Gemara discusses a false oath taken by witnesses. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When a witness takes an oath that he has no knowledge of the status of a lost item, <b>ben Azzai says</b> that <b>there are three</b> possible false <b>oaths,</b> i.e., the oath may be false for one of three reasons: The witness may have <b>recognized</b> the lost item <b>but</b> did <b>not</b> recognize <b>its finder,</b> or he may have recognized <b>its finder but</b> did <b>not</b> recognize the item, or he may have recognized <b>neither</b> the item <b>nor its finder.</b> In each of these cases, the witness took a false oath that he had no knowledge of the lost item, when in fact he had limited knowledge of it.",
            "The Gemara asks: In the third case cited above, where the witnesses recognized <b>neither</b> the item <b>nor its finder, he took his oath in truth</b> when he claimed that he did not have knowledge of the lost item. Why is this cited as an example of a false oath? The Gemara emends the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Say</b> that the reference here is to a case where he recognized both the item <b>and its finder.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>For which <i>halakha</i></b> did ben Azzai cite these examples? <b>Rav Ami says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina</b> says: They were cited <b>to</b> teach that there is <b>exemption</b> in these cases from bringing an offering for taking a false oath of testimony. <b>And Shmuel says</b> that these examples were cited <b>to</b> teach that the witness incurs <b>liability</b> to bring an offering in these cases.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> Rav Ami and Shmuel disagree <b>with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute</b> between <b>these <i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who administers an oath</b> to <b>a single witness</b> and the witness takes a false oath that he has no awareness of the monetary matter at hand, the witness is <b>exempt</b> from bringing a sin-offering; <b>and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, deems</b> the witness <b>liable</b> to bring a sin-offering.",

            "§ The Gemara discusses the <i>halakha</i> concerning a bailee who denies having a deposit in his possession. <b>Rav Sheshet says:</b> A bailee <b>who</b> falsely <b>denies</b> a claim <b>concerning a deposit becomes</b> as <b>a robber with regard to it, and</b> he is therefore <b>liable</b> to pay even <b>for</b> damage that is the result of <b>accidents.</b> The Gemara notes that <b>the <i>tanna</i></b> also <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> in a <i>baraita</i>.

The Gemara explains: <b>What, is</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>not</b> referring <b>to</b> the <b>punishment of</b> having to pay <b>money</b> due to his denial even for accidental damage, in accordance with the statement of Rav Sheshet?",
            "The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to</b> the <b>punishment</b> for taking a false <b>oath,</b> i.e., the additional one-fifth payment and the bringing of the offering. The Gemara challenges: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> a case <b>where he took an oath, it may be inferred that the first clause</b> teaches a case <b>where he did not take an oath,</b> and the punishment referred to by the <i>baraita</i> is the imposition of liability for accidental damage. <b>As the latter clause teaches</b> that the verse states: <b>“And swear to a lie”</b> (Leviticus 5:22), and <b>we learned</b> from this that there is <b>a punishment</b> for taking a false oath. <b>From where</b> is the <b>prohibition</b> itself derived? <b>The verse states: “Nor lie”</b> (Leviticus 19:11). <b>And from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause</b> teaches the <i>halakha</i> <b>where he took an oath, the first clause</b> must be teaching the <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where he did not take an oath.</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: The Sages <b>say</b> in response that both <b>this</b> clause <b>and that</b> clause are referring to a case <b>where he took an oath,</b> but <b>here,</b> in the latter clause, it is <b>where</b> the bailee <b>admitted</b> his false oath, while <b>there,</b> in the first clause, it is <b>where witnesses came</b> and testified that the deposit is in his possession.

            "After dismissing the attempted proof for Rav Sheshet’s statement that a bailee who denies possession of a deposit is considered a robber even without having taken a false oath, the Gemara now attempts to disprove the statement itself. <b>Rami bar Ḥama raises an objection</b> to Rav Sheshet’s statement: Though it is usually the defendant who is required to take an oath in order to avoid having to pay a claim, there are cases in which the plaintiff takes an oath to receive payment. The mishna in <i>Shevuot</i> (44b) lists these cases: <b>And</b> one such case is <b>where</b> the plaintiff’s <b>opponent,</b> i.e., the defendant, <b>is suspect with regard to an oath,</b> i.e., there is reason for the court to believe that he would take a false oath. <b>How</b> would the defendant have become suspect? It would be by having taken a false oath with regard to <b>either an oath of testimony or an oath on a deposit, or even</b> for <b>an oath</b> taken in <b>vain.</b>",
            "The Gemara comments: Since the mishna states that he becomes suspect only as a result of having taken a false oath, it can be inferred that he does not become suspect by virtue of denial of a claim alone. <b>And if it is so</b> that a bailee who denies having taken the deposit is considered a robber even without having taken an oath, then <b>it is with</b> his <b>denial that he</b> ought to be <b>disqualified,</b> as a robber does not have the credibility to take an oath.",
            "The Sages <b>say</b> in defense of Rav Sheshet’s opinion: <b>With what are we dealing here,</b> in the case of the mishna in <i>Shevuot</i>? We are dealing with a case <b>where</b> the deposit <b>stands in</b> a place not in the bailee’s possession, e.g., <b>a swamp, as</b> in this case his statement <b>is not</b> considered a complete <b>denial, because he thinks</b> to himself: <b>I will evade</b> the owner by claiming that I never took the deposit <b>until I go and bring it to him.</b> Therefore, he is not considered to be a robber. By contrast, Rav Sheshet is referring to a case where the bailee denied responsibility for the item while it was in his possession, as he intended to keep it for himself.",
            "The Gemara adds: <b>Know</b> that one who denies possession of an item only so that he may later return it is not considered a robber, <b>as Rav Idi bar Avin says: One who denies</b> a claim <b>concerning</b> having taken <b>a loan is fit to bear witness,</b>"
        ],

            "The Gemara raises a further difficulty with regard to Rav Sheshet’s opinion: <b>But didn’t Ilfa say</b> that <b>an oath effects acquisition,</b> meaning that once he testified falsely that he did not become a bailee, the item in question becomes his property, rendering him liable as a robber even for damage or loss resulting from accidents? The Gemara infers: <b>It is</b> the taking of <b>an oath that effects acquisition, but</b> mere <b>denial</b> of having become a bailee <b>does not effect acquisition.</b> The Gemara rejects this distinction: <b>Here too,</b> Ilfa must be referring to a case <b>where</b> the deposit <b>stands in</b> a place not in the bailee’s possession, e.g., <b>a swamp,</b> and as long as he does not take an oath, it can be assumed that his intention is simply to be evasive. But if the animal was standing in his house, then he acquires it as soon as he denies the claim.",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>What</b> is the meaning of Ilfa’s statement that <b>an oath effects acquisition?</b> It is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Rav Huna, as Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav said</b> that if one party says: <b>I</b> have <b>one hundred dinars in your possession, and the other</b> party <b>says: You do not</b> have any money <b>in my possession, and</b> the latter <b>took an oath</b> to that effect, <b>and later, witnesses came</b> and testified that his oath was false, he is <b>exempt, as it is stated:</b> “The oath of the Lord shall be between them both, to see whether he has not put his hand unto his neighbor’s goods; <b>and the owner thereof shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution”</b> (Exodus 22:10); teaching that <b>once the owner received an oath,</b> the one who took the oath <b>no longer pays monetary restitution.</b> Ilfa’s statement that an oath effects acquisition means that the bailee will no longer have to pay monetary restitution, and it does not relate to Rav Sheshet’s statement that the bailee becomes responsible for damage resulting from accidents as soon as he denies the claim.",
            "§ Having mentioned Rav’s ruling, the Gemara addresses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself: Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says</b> that if one party says: <b>I</b> have <b>one hundred dinars in your possession, and the other</b> party <b>says: You do not</b> have any money <b>in my possession, and</b> the latter <b>takes an oath</b> to that effect, <b>and later, witnesses came</b> and testified that his oath was false, he is <b>exempt, as it is stated: “And the owner thereof shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution”</b> (Exodus 22:10); teaching that <b>once the owner received an oath,</b> the one who took the oath <b>no longer pays monetary restitution.</b>",
            "<b>Rava said: Rav’s statement is reasonable in</b> the case of one who denies having taken <b>a loan, which is intended for expenditure.</b> Since the money is no longer in his possession, the Torah exempts him from monetary restitution once he takes an oath. <b>But</b> in the case of one who denies having accepted <b>a deposit, it remains in the owner’s possession</b> and must be returned intact, and it is not considered to be monetary restitution. Rava continues: <b>But, by God, Rav said</b> his statement <b>even in</b> the case of one who denies having accepted <b>a deposit, as when</b> this <b>verse</b> exempting him from payment <b>is written, it is written in</b> the case of one who denies having accepted <b>a deposit.</b>",

            "<b>But if you say,</b> as Rav did, that even <b>when witnesses come he is exempt</b> from paying, then the mishna’s ruling is difficult, as <b>is there any</b> similar case <b>where if witnesses come and testify with regard to it, he would be exempt, and</b> yet <b>we would stand and obligate him</b> to bring a guilt-<b>offering for a</b> later <b>oath,</b> for no reason other than <b>since he can</b> still <b>retract and admit</b> his liability?

            "He explains his ruling by means of a comparison: <b>Since a thief pays double payment, and</b> one who falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the deposit also <b>pays double payment,</b> it follows that <b>just as a thief, who</b> ordinarily <b>pays double payment,</b> and if he <b>slaughtered or sold</b> an animal he stole <b>pays fourfold or fivefold payment, so too,</b> one who falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole <b>a deposit, who</b> ordinarily <b>pays double payment,</b> if he <b>slaughtered or sold</b> the animal he received as a deposit <b>pays fourfold or fivefold payment.</b>",

But here,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that it is impossible to</b> eat even <b>an olive-bulk of meat without slaughtering</b> the animal first, indicating that it must have been slaughtered, <b>and</b> nevertheless <b>it teaches</b> that he <b>pays double payment.</b> It can be inferred that <b>double payment, yes,</b> he pays; but <b>fourfold or fivefold payment, no,</b> he does not pay.",
            "Rabbi Yoḥanan answers: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where he ate it</b> as an unslaughtered <b>animal carcass.</b> Since it was not killed according to the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual slaughter, the thief does not pay the fourfold or fivefold payment.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And let</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>answer</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba by saying that it is a case <b>such as where he ate it</b> as <b>an animal with a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>],</b> in accordance with Rabbi Shimon’s opinion that the legal status of an act of slaughter that is not fit for accomplishing its full ritual purpose is not considered an act of slaughter for which the thief must pay the fourfold or fivefold payment. The Gemara responds that Rabbi Yoḥanan holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says</b> that the legal status of an act of <b>slaughter that is not fit</b> for accomplishing its full ritual purpose <b>is considered</b> an act of <b>slaughter,</b> and the thief would pay the fourfold or fivefold payment.",
            "The Gemara further asks: <b>And let</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>answer</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba by saying that the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> is stated <b>with regard to an animal removed from its mother’s womb after the mother was ritually slaughtered [<i>ben pekua</i>],</b> which is permitted for consumption without slaughter, so that there is a possibility that the thief ate it without first slaughtering it. The Gemara responds that Rabbi Yoḥanan holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says</b> that <b>a <i>ben pekua</i> requires slaughter.</b>",
            "The Gemara further asks: <b>And let</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>answer</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba by saying that it is a case <b>where</b> the bailee <b>stood in judgment</b> in court, <b>and</b> the judges <b>said to him: Go out</b> and <b>give him</b> the stolen animal, and he did not do so, and subsequently slaughtered or sold it? In this case he would not pay the fourfold or fivefold payment, <b>as doesn’t Rava say</b> that if the judges instruct a thief: <b>Go out</b> and <b>give him</b> the stolen animal, <b>and he</b> instead <b>slaughtered or sold</b> it, he is <b>exempt</b> from paying the fourfold or fivefold payment. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Once</b> the court <b>ruled on his matter,</b> requiring him to give the animal to the owner, and he did not heed the court’s ruling <b>but slaughtered or sold</b> the animal, <b>he is</b> considered <b>a robber,</b> and not a thief; <b>and a robber does not pay fourfold or fivefold payment.</b>",
            "Rava continues: But if the judges say only: <b>You are obligated to give</b> the animal <b>to him,</b> and he did not heed the court’s statement <b>but slaughtered or sold</b> the animal, then he is <b>obligated</b> to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Since</b> the court <b>has not issued a definitive ruling in</b> this <b>matter, he is still</b> considered <b>a thief</b> rather than a robber.",
            "The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>And according to your reasoning, let</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>answer</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba by saying that the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> is stated <b>with regard to a partner who slaughtered</b> an animal stolen by him and his partner <b>without the other</b> partner’s <b>knowledge,</b> as the <i>halakha</i> is that in such a case, the thief, i.e., the partner who slaughtered the animal, does not pay fourfold or fivefold payment. <b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>selected one of two or three</b> possible answers but did not mean to say that it was the only possible answer.",
            "§ The Gemara cites a related ruling: <b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>one who</b> falsely <b>states the claim, with regard to a lost item,</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole it, i.e., he found a lost item, and when the owner requested its return, he claimed that it had been stolen from him, and it became known that he lied and had taken the item himself, <b>he pays double payment. What is the reason</b> for this? <b>As it is written</b> in the verse concerning double payment for a thief: “For any matter of trespass, from an ox, for a donkey, for a sheep, for a garment, or <b>for any lost item about which one shall say:</b> This is it, the claims of both of them shall come before the judges; the one whom the judges convict shall pay double to his neighbor” (Exodus 22:8). It can be seen from here that double payment applies to a false claim of theft even with regard to a lost item.",
            "<b>Rabbi Abba bar Memel raised an objection to Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“If a man gives</b> his neighbor money or vessels to safeguard, and it was stolen from the house of the man, if the thief shall be found, he shall pay double” (Exodus 22:6). The use of the word “man” indicates that the <b>giving</b> of a deposit <b>by a minor is nothing. And I have</b> derived <b>only</b> a case <b>where he gives</b> the deposit <b>when he is a minor and lodges the claim</b> concerning it <b>against</b> the bailee <b>when he is</b> still a <b>minor. From where</b> is it derived that the <i>halakha</i> would be the same in a case where <b>he gives</b> the deposit <b>when he is a minor and lodges the claim</b> concerning it <b>against</b> the bailee <b>when he is an adult? The verse states: “The claims of both of them shall come before the judges”</b> (Exodus 22:8), i.e., the claim is valid <b>only when</b> the <b>giving</b> of the deposit <b>and</b> the <b>claim are equal,</b> both done when he is an adult.",
            "Based on the ruling of this <i>baraita</i>, Rabbi Abba bar Memel raises his objection: <b>And if it is so</b> that even one who finds a lost item pays double payment for claiming falsely that it was stolen, indicating that the giving of the item as a deposit by the owner is not an essential condition to render the thief liable for double payment, then the claim of a minor <b>should be like a lost item as well,</b> and one who received a deposit from a minor should be liable for double payment. Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba <b>said to him: With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where</b> the bailee <b>consumed</b> the deposit <b>when</b> the owner <b>was</b> still <b>a minor,</b> so that at the time it was consumed, the owner had no legal standing. Therefore, the bailee is not obligated to pay.",
            "Rabbi Abba bar Memel questions this answer: <b>But</b> had the bailee consumed it <b>when</b> the owner was already <b>an adult, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>; <b>indeed,</b> would the <i>halakha</i> be <b>that</b> the bailee <b>pays? If so, rather than teaching:</b> The claim is valid <b>only when</b> the <b>giving</b> of the deposit <b>and</b> the <b>claim are equal, let</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach:</b> The claim is valid <b>only when</b> the <b>consumption</b> of the deposit <b>and</b> the <b>claim are equal,</b> which would be a more precise ruling. Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba <b>said to him:</b> Emend the <i>baraita</i> and <b>teach:</b> The claim is valid <b>only when</b> the <b>consumption</b> of the deposit <b>and</b> the <b>claim are equal.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Ashi said</b> a different answer to Rabbi Abba bar Memel’s objection: The two cases <b>are not comparable,</b> so an objection to Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba’s statement concerning a lost item cannot be derived from the case of a minor giving a deposit, because the <b>lost item came</b> into the possession of the finder <b>by</b> the <b>power of one</b> who is <b>mentally competent,</b> as the one who lost it is presumed to be an adult, though he did not personally give it to the finder; <b>but this</b> deposit given by a minor <b>did not come</b> into his possession <b>by</b> the <b>power of one</b> who is <b>mentally competent,</b> as from a halakhic perspective, a minor is not considered mentally competent. Therefore, he has no grounds for a claim.",

            "<b>A merging of</b> Torah <b>portions is written here,</b> and the <i>halakha</i> written in this passage is in fact meant to be applied to a different passage. <b>And when it is written: “This is it,”</b> from which the <i>halakha</i> of a partial admission is derived, <b>it is written concerning a loan,</b> not a deposit. The Gemara asks: <b>And what is different</b> about <b>a loan</b> that this <i>halakha</i> would apply only there?",
            "The Gemara answers: It is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabba, as Rabba says: For what</b> reason <b>did the Torah say</b> that one who <b>admits to a part of the claim must take an oath?</b> It is because there is <b>a presumption</b> that <b>a person does not exhibit insolence</b> by lying <b>in the presence of his creditor,</b> who had done him a favor by lending money to him. <b>And this</b> person who denies part of the claim actually <b>wants to deny all of</b> the debt, so as to be exempt, <b>and this</b> fact <b>that he does not deny</b> all of <b>it</b> is <b>because a person does not exhibit insolence.</b>",
            "Rabba continues: <b>And</b> in order not to exhibit insolence, he <b>wants to admit to</b> the creditor <b>with regard to all of</b> the debt, <b>and this</b> fact <b>that he denies</b> owing <b>him in part</b> is because he <b>reasons: If I admit to him with regard to all of</b> the debt, <b>he will lodge a claim against me with regard to all of it,</b> and right now I do not have the money to pay. <b>I will evade him at least</b> for <b>now until I have money, and</b> then <b>I will pay</b> him all of it.

            "The Gemara completes its answer: <b>And it is with regard to a loan that this can be said,</b> as the basis for this explanation is that one will not exhibit insolence before his creditor, who did him a favor by lending him money; <b>but with regard to a deposit, one will certainly exhibit insolence,</b> as the claimant did him no favor. Therefore, there is no reason to say that one who completely denies a claim concerning a deposit is deemed credible any more than one who admitted to part of it, and he is obligated to take an oath in either case.",

            "The Gemara quotes the source for this statement. <b>Rava said: What is the reasoning</b> for the statement <b>of Rami bar Ḥama?</b> Concerning <b>an unpaid bailee, it is explicitly written with regard to him: “This is it,”</b> as explained earlier. Concerning <b>a paid bailee,</b> Rami bar Ḥama <b>learns</b> by means of a verbal analogy to the term <b>giving</b> used with regard to a paid bailee <b>from</b> the term <b>giving</b> used with regard to <b>an unpaid bailee,</b> since the verses about both a paid and an unpaid bailee begin: “If a man gives his neighbor” (Exodus 22:6, 9).",
            "Rava continues: Rami bar Ḥama learns the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>a borrower</b> from the verse: <b>“And if [<i>vekhi</i>] a man borrow”</b> (Exodus 22:13). There is a principle that the conjunction “and,” represented by the letter <b><i>vav</i>, adds to the previous topic.</b> Based on this principle, the <i>halakhot</i> of a borrower are connected to those of the subject of the previous verse, the bailee. Concerning <b>a renter, if</b> Rami bar Ḥama is stating his ruling <b>according to the one who says</b> that a renter is <b>like a paid bailee,</b> this <b>is</b> the same as <b>a paid bailee; if</b> he is stating his ruling <b>according to the one who says</b> that a renter is <b>like an unpaid bailee,</b> this <b>is</b> the same as <b>an unpaid bailee.</b>",

The verse states: “If the thief shall not be found, <b>the owner of the house shall approach the judges to determine if he misappropriated his neighbor’s goods”</b> (Exodus 22:7), and the following verse concludes: “The one whom the judges convict shall pay double to his neighbor.” <b>By inference,</b> one can learn <b>that if he misappropriated it, he is liable</b> for double payment; <b>that is to say that we are dealing</b> only <b>with</b> a case <b>where he misappropriates it.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said to</b> his students: <b>This</b> is what <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> that one who falsely claims that the deposit was stolen is liable for double payment <b>with regard to</b> an animal still <b>standing over its</b> feeding <b>trough,</b> i.e., the bailee is still safeguarding it for its owner. <b>Rabbi Zeira said to Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: Is he stating</b> his ruling <b>specifically with regard to</b> an animal <b>standing over its</b> feeding <b>trough, but if the</b> bailee <b>misappropriated it</b> before taking an oath, he has <b>acquired</b> it, <b>and an oath is not effective for him at all,</b> not even to cause him to be liable to pay double payment? <b>Or perhaps he is stating</b> his ruling <b>even with regard to</b> an animal <b>standing over its</b> feeding <b>trough,</b> in addition to an animal that the bailee misappropriated?",

So too, one who misappropriates the deposit thereby acquires it and is no longer obligated to take an oath.",
            "Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: No,</b> there is no proof from there, because one could argue that the reason is not because he acquired the item with the first oath; rather, <b>since it left the owner’s possession with</b> the bailee taking the <b>first oath,</b> he is exempt from taking an additional oath with regard to the same claim, but his oath will be significant even after having misappropriated the item.",

The Gemara explores the reason for this <i>halakha</i>. <b>Rami bar Ḥama raises a dilemma:</b> Is it the <b>monetary</b> obligation <b>that renders him liable</b> for <b>double payment</b> which <b>exempts him from the</b> additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment, <b>or perhaps</b> is it the taking of the <b>oath that renders him liable for double payment</b> which <b>exempts him from the</b> additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment?",

            "The Gemara explains their opinions: <b>Abaye says</b> that the double payment is paid <b>to the owner of the deposit; since</b> the bailee <b>troubled him by</b> taking <b>an oath</b> instead of paying immediately, the owner is <b>not</b> willing to <b>grant acquisition of the double payment to</b> the bailee, so it is paid to the owner. <b>Rava says</b> that the double payment is paid <b>to the one in whose</b> possession <b>the deposit</b> was when it was stolen; <b>once he paid,</b> the owner <b>grants acquisition of the double payment to</b> the bailee.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>And they disagree with regard to the</b> deductive <b>inference</b> to be drawn from the wording <b>of the mishna, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 33b): In the case of <b>one who deposits with another,</b> i.e., an unpaid bailee, <b>an animal or vessels, and they were stolen or lost,</b> and the bailee <b>paid</b> the owner <b>and did not wish to take an oath,</b> which he may decide to do, <b>as</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that <b>an unpaid bailee takes an oath</b> that he is exempt <b>and is released</b> from the obligation to pay the owner, but may also opt to pay; in such a case the <i>halakha</i> is that if <b>the thief was found he pays double payment,</b> or if the deposited item was a sheep or an ox and the thief <b>slaughtered or sold</b> it <b>he pays</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment.

            "§ <b>Ravina raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to payment for <b>robbery of a female convert, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>The Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: “But if the <b>man</b> has no kinsman” (Numbers 5:8), indicating that the <i>halakha</i> applies to a male convert, <b>but not</b> to <b>a woman,</b> i.e., a female convert; if she dies after being robbed, payment is not given to the priests. <b>Or perhaps it is the manner of the verse</b> to employ masculine wording, but the <i>halakha</i> applies in the case of a female convert as well?",
            "<b>Rav Aharon said to Ravina: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution to your dilemma, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states in its entirety: “But if the <b>man</b> has no kinsman to whom restitution may be made for the guilt, the restitution for guilt that is made shall be the Lord’s, even the priest’s; besides the ram of the atonement, whereby atonement shall be made for him.” <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that it is referring to <b>a man; from where</b> is it derived that this applies equally to <b>a woman? When it states:</b> “The restitution for guilt <b>that is made,” there are two</b> instances of the phrase “that is made” <b>here,</b> as the verse mentions making restitution twice, to include a female convert in this <i>halakha</i>.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> specifically <b>“man”?</b> The <i>baraita</i> explains: To pay a convert who is <b>a man, you need to investigate concerning him</b> to determine <b>if he has a kinsman or not,</b> but to pay a convert who is <b>a minor you do not need to investigate concerning him.

            "§ With regard to the payment to priests in the case of one who robbed a convert who then died without heirs, <b>the Sages taught:</b> The verse states: “Restitution for guilt that is made <b>shall be the Lord’s, even the priest’s”</b> (Numbers 5:8), teaching that <b>the Name,</b> i.e., God, <b>acquired it and gave it to the priest who is in that priestly watch.</b> Do <b>you say</b> that it is given only <b>to the priest who is on that priestly watch?

And</b> there is <b>a logical derivation</b> to support this reasoning, as follows: <b>If</b> a priest <b>has the right to acquire</b> the payment <b>belonging to others</b> who stole from a convert, then with regard to payment <b>belonging to himself,</b> which is already in his possession, is it <b>not all the more so</b> that he should keep it?",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Natan states</b> this logical inference <b>with different wording: And just as</b> with regard to <b>a matter in which</b> a priest <b>has no portion until it enters his possession,</b> e.g., <i>teruma</i>, which can be given to any priest, <b>once it enters his possession</b> another priest <b>cannot remove it from his possession;</b> so too, with regard to <b>a matter in which</b> a priest <b>has a portion</b> even <b>before it enters his possession,</b> e.g., an item stolen from a convert, in which he has a portion as one of the priests on the priestly watch, <b>isn’t it logical that another</b> priest <b>cannot remove it from his possession</b> once it is in his possession?",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues, countering that this logical inference is not correct: <b>No, if you said</b> this <b>concerning a matter in which</b> a priest <b>has no portion,</b> where the reason why once it enters his possession another priest cannot remove it from his possession is <b>that just as he has no portion in it, so too, others have no portion in it; would you say</b> the same <b>concerning</b> an item <b>robbed</b> from a convert? As there it could be said <b>that just as</b> the priest who robbed him <b>has a portion in it</b> as one of the priests on the priestly watch, <b>so too, other</b> priests on that watch <b>have a portion in it.

            "The Gemara raises an objection: <b>But isn’t it written: “And every man’s hallowed things shall be his;</b> whatsoever any man gives to the priest, it shall be his” (Numbers 5:10), indicating that a priest is not required to give to the other priests the offerings he sacrifices? Therefore, just as he has the right to the flesh of the guilt-offering that he brings to atone for robbing the convert, shouldn’t he also have the right to the payment? The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here,</b> in this case? We are dealing <b>with a ritually impure priest,</b> who is unfit to sacrifice the guilt-offering and therefore does not have rights to the flesh of the offering. In this case, he will not be able to keep the payment for himself.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> the <i>baraita</i> states its ruling specifically <b>with regard to an impure priest,</b> how can it describe the payment as <b>a matter in which</b> the priest <b>has a portion? Does he have</b> a portion in it? Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> must not be referring to an impure priest. <b>Rather,</b> there is another reason why he has no right to the payment. This <i>halakha</i> is <b>derived</b> through a verbal analogy between the phrase <b>“even the priest’s [<i>lakohen</i>]”</b> (Numbers 5:8) written in this context, and the phrase <b>“to the priest [<i>lakohen</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 27:21) <b>from</b> the verse stated concerning <b>an ancestral field,</b> which, if consecrated and then redeemed by another does not revert to its original owner in the Jubilee Year, but is given to the priests, as the <i>baraita</i> will now explain.",
            "<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states: “But the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be holy unto the Lord, as a field dedicated; the possession thereof shall be to the priest” (Leviticus 27:21). The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> the term: <b>“The possession thereof”?

            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> there is <b>a logical derivation</b> to support this reasoning, as follows: If <b>I acquire</b> the field <b>belonging to others,</b> who consecrated it and it was then redeemed, then with regard to a field <b>belonging to me,</b> which is already in my possession, is it <b>not all the more so</b> that I should keep it?",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues, countering that this logical inference is not correct. <b>The verse states: “As a field dedicated; the possession thereof shall be to the priest”</b> (Leviticus 27:21), indicating that a field of which the priest has <b>possession</b> from his ancestors <b>is his, but this</b> field that he redeemed <b>is not his.

            "who testify <b>in the absence of a litigant?</b> Since the defendant is a minor his presence is not legally recognized, and the court does not accept testimony against him. Rabbi Yirmeya questioned this assertion: <b>And</b> is it so that the court does <b>not</b> accept such testimony? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> that if a robber leaves stolen goods to his children, <b>whether they are adults or minors, they are obligated</b> to pay the owner? If the court obligates minors to pay, it must accept testimony about them. Rabbi Avin <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yirmeya: <b>Sumakhos’s dispute is at your side,</b> i.e., Sumakhos disagrees with this ruling and holds that the minors are exempt from paying. Rabbi Yirmeya <b>said</b> to him: <b>Did the whole world go to the effort to hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Sumakhos</b> in order <b>to seize what is mine?</b>",
            "<b>In the meantime, the matter circulated and</b> eventually <b>came before Rabbi Abbahu,</b> who <b>said: Did you not hear that which Rav Yosef bar Ḥama says</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya</b> says? <b>As Rav Yosef bar Ḥama says</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya says:</b> With regard to <b>a child who took his slaves and descended into the field of another and said: It is mine,</b> the court <b>does not say: Let us wait until he matures</b> before we assess his claims. <b>Rather,</b> the court <b>removes it from his possession immediately, and when he matures he may bring witnesses</b> to attest to his claim <b>and we will see</b> how to judge the case. Similarly, Rabbi Yirmeya should be awarded the disputed property until his minor brother-in-law may litigate in court.",
            "The Gemara rejects Rabbi Abbahu’s assertion: <b>Is</b> the case that Rav Yosef bar Ḥama discusses <b>comparable</b> to the case of Rabbi Yirmeya? <b>It is there,</b> in Rav Yosef bar Ḥama’s case, <b>that we seize</b> the property <b>from him, because there is no presumption</b> of ownership <b>from his father; but where he does have a presumption</b> of ownership <b>from his father, no,</b> we do not seize his property. Since Rabbi Yirmeya’s brother-in-law has a presumption of ownership due to the fact that the property belonged to his father, he retains control of the property.",
            "§ Having mentioned the issue of testimony in the absence of a litigant, the Gemara discusses this matter in greater detail. <b>Rav Ashi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Shabbtai says:</b> The court <b>accepts witnesses</b> even <b>in the absence of a litigant.

            "<b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina received</b> the following guideline <b>from</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan: The court accepts testimony in the absence of the defendant only in a case <b>where</b> the plaintiff <b>was ill, or his witnesses were ill, or his witnesses wished to travel overseas and</b> the judges <b>sent</b> for the defendant <b>and he did not come.</b> Since there is a concern that the plaintiff will not be able to present his claims at a later date, the testimony is accepted even in the absence of the defendant.",
            "<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The court <b>accepts witnesses in the absence of a litigant. Mar Ukva said:</b> This statement <b>was explained to me</b> personally <b>by Shmuel himself,</b> and he said that it applies in a case <b>where</b> the court <b>opened his case and sent for him, but he did not appear. But</b> if it <b>did not</b> yet <b>open the case for him, he may say to</b> the plaintiff: <b>I am going to the High Court</b> to resolve this case and will not appear in the local court.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> then even <b>when</b> the court already <b>opened</b> the case <b>for him, he</b> should <b>also</b> be <b>able</b> to <b>say to them: I am going to the High Court</b> to resolve this case. The Gemara answers that <b>Ravina said:</b> The defendant may not defer an opened case to the High Court if, <b>for example,</b> the local court <b>obtained a license from the High Court</b> authorizing it to adjudicate the case.",
            "§ Having discussed testimony in the absence of a litigant, the Gemara addresses a similar matter. <b>Rav says:</b> The court <b>ratifies a document in the absence of a litigant. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The court <b>does not ratify a document in the absence of a litigant. Rav Sheshet said to Rabbi Yosei bar Abbahu: I will explain Rabbi Yoḥanan’s reasoning to you. The verse states</b> with regard to an ox that gored: <b>“And warning has been given to its owner and he has not secured it”</b> (Exodus 21:29). <b>The Torah</b> means to <b>say:</b> Let <b>the owner of the ox come and stand by his ox</b> when the testimony about the ox is provided. Similarly, a document may be ratified only in the presence of the individual it implicates.",
            "<b>Rava said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that the court <b>ratifies a document in the absence of a litigant, and</b> this is the case <b>even</b> if the other litigant <b>stands and screams</b> in protest that the document is a forgery. <b>And if he said: Give me time until I bring witnesses and disqualify the document, we give him</b> time before forcing him to pay. <b>If he has come</b> with witnesses within the time allotted to him, <b>he has come,</b> and the court reviews the case accordingly. <b>If he does not come</b> within the time allotted to him, <b>we give him</b> an additional three days on which to bring witnesses, when the court is in session: <b>Monday, Thursday, and Monday.</b>",
            "<b>If he</b> still <b>has not come, we write a document of ostracism against him</b> for <b>ninety days.</b> During <b>the first thirty</b> days <b>we do not descend to his property</b> to collect his debt, <b>as</b> the court <b>says:</b> Perhaps <b>he is occupied</b> with <b>borrowing money</b> to pay his debt.

During the <b>final</b> thirty days <b>as well, we do not descend to his property, as</b> the court <b>says:</b> Perhaps the debtor has found a purchaser and <b>the purchaser himself is occupied with</b> obtaining the <b>money</b> so that he can pay the debtor for the sale, and the debtor will then pay his debt.",
            "If the debtor still <b>did not come</b> to pay his debt after ninety days, <b>we write</b> a document of <b>authorization [<i>adrakhta</i>]</b> allowing the creditor to collect his due from any <b>property</b> belonging to the debtor. <b>And this statement</b> applies only in a case <b>where</b> the debtor <b>said: I am coming</b> to pay and then he does not actually make an appearance. <b>But</b> if <b>he said: I am not coming, we immediately write</b> a document of authorization without waiting for ninety days to pass.",
            "Furthermore, <b>this matter</b> of a ninety-day waiting period applies only <b>with regard to a loan,</b> as the debtor requires time in order to obtain the money to pay it back. <b>But with regard to a deposit</b> that the owner demands back from a bailee, <b>we write</b> a document of authorization <b>immediately.</b> Since a bailee should have immediate access to the deposit, there is no reason to grant him an extension.",
            "The Gemara adds: <b>When we write</b> a document of authorization, the document applies only <b>to</b> the borrower’s <b>land, but</b> with regard <b>to movable property,</b> the court does <b>not</b> draft such a document. The reason for this is that <b>perhaps the creditor will seize and consume</b> the borrower’s <b>movable property, and when the borrower</b> later <b>comes and brings witnesses and</b> thereby <b>invalidates the</b> creditor’s <b>document, he will not find anything to collect</b> in order to retrieve his money.",
            "<b>And if the creditor</b> owns <b>land, we write</b> a document authorizing the creditor to collect from any property that belongs to the borrower, including movable property. Since the creditor owns land, there is no concern that if the borrower manages to overturn the ruling he will have nothing from which to collect. The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> that <b>is not so.</b> The court <b>does not draft</b> a document of <b>authorization with regard to movable property even if</b> the creditor <b>has land.</b> This is because <b>we are concerned lest</b> the creditor’s land <b>depreciate</b> in value and the borrower will be unable to retrieve his money.",
            "The Gemara teaches another <i>halakha</i> with regard to this matter: <b>When we write</b> the document of <b>authorization, we inform</b> the party that is liable to pay, as a final warning before authorizing a creditor to locate and take possession of his property in repayment of the debt. <b>And this matter</b> applies only <b>when he is nearby, but</b> if he is <b>distant,</b> the court does <b>not</b> notify him before authorizing the creditor.",
            "<b>And if he is distant but there are relatives</b> of his nearby, <b>or</b> if <b>there are caravans that go</b> to the borrower’s current location <b>and return, we delay</b> issuing <b>his</b> document of authorization for the <b>twelve months</b> of <b>the year, until the caravan goes and returns,</b> so that if he wishes to make a claim, he can do so. This is <b>like that</b> incident <b>where Ravina delayed</b> for the <b>twelve months</b> of <b>the year</b> before issuing a document of authorization <b>for Mar Aḥa, until a caravan went</b> to <b>and returned from Bei Ḥozai.</b>",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> that <b>is not so. There,</b> Ravina delayed issuing the document because the creditor <b>was a violent man,</b> and <b>if</b> a document of <b>authorization would come into his possession, it would not be possible to take it from him</b> if the borrower would prove that the original document was invalid. <b>But here,</b> i.e., in general, <b>we wait for</b> the defendant to be informed <b>only</b> if he is close enough to be informed within a day. Consequently, if the court decided the issue on Monday, <b>a messenger</b> would <b>go</b> inform the defendant <b>on Tuesday, and he</b> could <b>come</b> from his location to the court <b>on Wednesday and stand trial on Thursday.</b> If a debtor is more than a day’s travel away, however, the court does not trouble itself to notify him.",
            "§ Apropos the Gemara’s discussion of summoning an individual to court by means of a messenger, the Gemara discusses this issue in a more general manner. <b>Ravina said: We deem the agent of the Rabbis,</b> who was sent to summon an individual to court, as <b>credible as two</b> witnesses if he says that the defendant refuses to come to court. <b>And this matter</b> applies only with regard <b>to excommunication, but</b> with regard <b>to</b> issuing <b>a document of ostracism, since it causes</b> the defendant <b>loss of money, as he must give money to the scribe</b> for drafting the document, <b>no,</b> the agent is not deemed credible.",
            "Additionally, <b>Ravina said: We may give</b> a defendant a particular <b>time</b> to appear in court by informing him of the trial <b>by</b> word of <b>mouth from a woman or from his neighbors,</b> as these people are trusted to notify the defendant of the court’s summons.

        [
            "<b>But</b> if the defendant <b>is in the city,</b> the court does <b>not</b> ostracize him for failing to respond to a summons conveyed through a woman or a neighbor, <b>as we say:</b> Perhaps <b>they did not tell him</b> of the court’s summons, <b>as they said</b> to themselves: Since the defendant is in the city, <b>a court agent</b> has already <b>found him and told him.</b> As a result, these unofficial messengers will not deliver the court’s summons to the defendant at all.",
            "<b>And</b> similarly, <b>we said</b> that the court will ostracize one who does not respond to a summons conveyed through a woman or a neighbor <b>only</b> in a case <b>where he does not pass by the court’s entrance</b> on his way home, <b>but</b> if he does <b>pass by the court’s entrance,</b> the court does <b>not</b> ostracize him.

            "<b>And</b> furthermore, <b>we said</b> that the court will ostracize one who does not respond to a summons <b>only</b> in a case <b>where he comes</b> home <b>on the</b> same <b>day</b> that the woman or neighbor is sent to deliver the court summons. <b>But</b> if he does <b>not come</b> home <b>on the</b> same <b>day,</b> he is <b>not</b> ostracized, because it is possible to <b>say</b> that <b>they forgot</b> to notify him.",

Similarly, if the document of ostracism was written <b>due to</b> the fact that <b>he did not obey</b> the ruling of <b>the court, we do not tear it up for him until he</b> actually <b>obeys</b> the ruling.

Apparently, it is permitted to deceive a gentile.",
            "The Gemara challenges this assertion: <b>But is robbery</b> from <b>a gentile permitted? Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon said</b> that <b>Rabbi Akiva taught this matter when he came from Zephirin: From where</b> is it derived that it is <b>prohibited</b> to <b>rob a gentile?</b> It is from the fact that <b>the verse states</b> with regard to a Jew who has been sold as a slave to a gentile: <b>“After he is sold he may be redeemed”</b> (Leviticus 25:48),"

This indicates that it is prohibited to steal from a gentile.",
            "The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> It is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> ruling that permits the court to deceive a gentile is issued <b>with regard to</b> a regular <b>gentile,</b> whereas <b>that</b> verse, which teaches that it is prohibited to deceive a gentile, is stated <b>with regard to a gentile who resides in Eretz Yisrael and observes the seven Noahide mitzvot [<i>ger toshav</i>].</b>",
            "<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: How is it possible to differentiate between a gentile and a <i>ger toshav</i>? <b>Aren’t both of them written next to each other,</b> indicating that the same <i>halakha</i> pertains to both? As it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: One who violates the prohibitions of the Sabbatical Year will be punished by having to resort to selling himself as a slave. And he will sell himself <b>not to you, but to a stranger, as it is stated:</b> “And sell himself unto <b>the stranger”</b> (Leviticus 25:47), <b>and not to a stranger</b> who is a convert, <b>but to a <i>ger toshav</i>, as it is stated:</b> “And sell himself unto <b>the stranger who is a settler [<i>ger toshav</i>]</b> with you” (Leviticus 25:47).",

Since it is subsequently stated: “He shall reckon with him that bought him” (Leviticus 25:50), it is apparent that this reckoning applies equally to each of the above, including the gentile.

            "<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: The release of <b>a Hebrew slave</b> from his gentile master <b>is</b> akin to the <b>abrogation of his loan.</b> The purchase price paid by the master is considered as a loan that the slave pays back over the years of his servitude until he goes free at the Jubilee. Consequently, deceptively bringing about his early release is akin to abrogating a loan, yet Rabbi Akiva derives from the verse that it is prohibited to do so. The Gemara answers that <b>Rava</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as Rava says: The body of a Hebrew slave is owned</b> by his master, and retaking him from the gentile by deceptive means would therefore constitute actual robbery.",
            "The Gemara cites another statement related to stealing from a gentile. <b>Rav Beivai bar Giddel says</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon Ḥasida says:</b> It is <b>prohibited</b> to <b>rob a gentile,</b> but it is <b>permitted</b> to retain <b>his lost item,</b> i.e., one is not required to return it to him. The Gemara examines the basis for each of these rulings: It is <b>prohibited</b> to <b>rob a gentile, as Rav Huna says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to <b>rob a gentile?</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “And you shall consume all the peoples that the Lord your God shall deliver unto you”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:16), indicating that it is permitted to consume the other nations’ property only <b>when they are delivered into your hand,</b> i.e., in times of war, <b>but not when they are not delivered into your hand.</b>",
            "It is <b>permitted</b> to retain <b>his lost item, as Rav Ḥama bar Gurya says</b> that <b>Rav says: From where</b> is it derived that it is <b>permitted</b> to retain <b>the lost item of a gentile?</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the mitzva of returning a lost item: <b>“With every lost thing of your brother’s”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:3), indicating that it is only <b>to your brother</b> that <b>you return</b> a lost item, <b>but you do not return</b> a lost item <b>to a gentile.</b>",
            "The Gemara questions this derivation: <b>But say</b> that <b>this applies</b> only <b>where</b> the item <b>has not yet come into</b> the Jew’s <b>hand, as he is not obligated to pursue it</b> in an effort to find the lost item and return it. <b>But</b> in a case <b>where the item had</b> already <b>come into his hand, say</b> that he must <b>return it</b> to the gentile. The Gemara answers that <b>Ravina said:</b> It is understood from the verse itself, as it states: “And so shall you do with every lost thing of your brother’s, which he has lost, <b>and you have found”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:3), which <b>indicates</b> that the verse refers even to an item <b>that</b> has already <b>come into one’s hand.</b> It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir says: In a case where there is</b> a concern that retention of an article lost by a gentile will result in the <b>desecration of</b> God’s <b>name,</b> it is <b>prohibited even</b> to retain a gentile’s <b>lost item.</b>",
            "The Gemara adds: <b>Shmuel says</b> that it is <b>permitted</b> to financially benefit from a business <b>error</b> of a gentile, i.e., it need not be returned. The Gemara notes that this is <b>like that</b> incident <b>where Shmuel purchased a golden bowl [<i>lakna</i>] from a gentile in exchange [<i>bemar</i>] for</b> the price <b>of an iron</b> bowl, which was <b>four dinars, and</b> Shmuel <b>included one</b> additional <b>dinar</b> in the payment so that the gentile would not realize his mistake.",
            "The Gemara relates another incident: <b>Rav Kahana purchased one hundred and twenty barrels from a gentile for</b> the price of <b>one hundred</b> barrels, <b>and he included one</b> additional <b>dinar</b> in the payment. Rav Kahana <b>said to him: Take note that I am relying upon you</b> to check that the transaction has been carried out properly. The Gemara records a third episode: <b>Ravina and a gentile purchased a palm tree</b> together in order <b>to chop it up</b> and split the wood between them. Ravina <b>said to his attendant: Hurry and precede</b> the gentile so that you can bring my share of the wood <b>from the trunk</b> of the tree, which is thicker than the upper part of the tree, <b>as the gentile knows</b> only the <b>number</b> of logs that he is due to receive and will not realize that you are taking thicker pieces.",
            "The Gemara relates a final anecdote: <b>Rav Ashi was traveling on the road</b> and <b>he saw a branch of a grapevine in an orchard, and</b> there were <b>clusters of grapes hanging on it. He said to his attendant: Go see</b> to whom these clusters belong. <b>If they are</b> owned by <b>a gentile, bring</b> some to me, but <b>if they are</b> owned by <b>a Jew, do not bring me</b> any. <b>A certain gentile who was sitting in the orchard overheard</b> Rav Ashi’s instructions. The gentile <b>said to him:</b> Is it <b>permitted</b> to steal the property <b>of a gentile?</b> Rav Ashi <b>said to him: A gentile takes money</b> for his grapes, and I intended to pay for them, but <b>a Jew does not take money</b> for his grapes and I did not want to take them without paying for them.",
            "§ The Gemara relates to <b>the</b> matter of civil law <b>itself. Shmuel says: The law of the kingdom is the law,</b> and the halakhic principle is that Jews must obey the laws of the state in which they reside. <b>Rava said: Know</b> that this principle is true from the fact <b>that</b> the municipal authorities <b>cut down palm trees</b> without the consent of their owners <b>and construct bridges</b> from them, <b>and</b> yet <b>we cross over them.</b> Evidently, the wood is not considered stolen property, which one is prohibited from using, because the law of the kingdom is the law.",
            "<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>Perhaps</b> the reason the bridges may be used is <b>because their owners despaired of retrieving them</b> and not because the law of the kingdom is the law. Rava <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>If not</b> for the fact that <b>the law of the kingdom is the law, how</b> would the <b>despair</b> of the owners of the trees allow us to use the bridges? The fact that the owners have despaired of retrieving their wood does not effect a transfer of property, and it therefore still belongs to them.",
            "The Gemara questions Rava’s understanding: <b>But</b> the municipal authorities <b>do not act as the king said. The king said: Go and cut</b> down a bit of wood <b>from all the valleys</b> in the area so that each individual loses only a small amount of wood. <b>They,</b> however, disobey the king and <b>go and cut</b> down all the wood needed for the bridge <b>from one valley.</b> Therefore, even if the law of the kingdom is the law, this cannot be the reason that the <i>halakha</i> permits Jews to cross over such bridges, as the authorities are not enforcing the law of the kingdom, but rather their own unlawful inclinations.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>An agent of a king</b> is <b>like the king</b> himself, and he is <b>not</b> expected to <b>trouble</b> himself to collect wood proportionally from each valley. <b>They,</b> the owners of the land where the wood is cut, <b>cause themselves a loss, as they should collect</b> compensation <b>from all</b> the other residents <b>of the valleys and take money</b> from them for this purpose. Since the land owners whose wood was used have permission to collect compensation from all the residents in the area, the authorities are acting within their rights by confiscating wood from a single location.",
            "Similarly, <b>Rava says:</b> When the king’s agents come to collect the king’s share of the grain from a field owned by several partners, the <b>one who is found in the granary</b> must <b>pay the king’s share</b> for the entire property, as the agents are not expected to locate and exact payment from each individual proprietor separately. The partner who paid may later claim reimbursement from the other owners for covering their share of the tax. <b>And this statement</b> applies only to <b>partners</b> who share ownership of the field. <b>But a sharecropper collects his portion</b> from the crop but does not own a share of the land. Consequently, the tax may not be collected from his produce, and doing so would constitute robbery.",
            "<b>And Rava</b> also <b>says:</b> Property that belongs to <b>a town dweller may be taken as security for</b> the tax owed by another <b>town dweller. And this statement applies</b> only <b>to the property tax and head tax of that year, but</b> with regard to taxes from <b>the previous year, since the king has</b> already <b>been appeased,</b> the ability to take property belonging to someone else has <b>passed.</b> The tax collector has already paid the entire amount he must pay the king for the previous year, and everything else he collects is his own profit. Although he has the right to collect this extra amount, he may not take property for one person as security for the taxes of someone else.",
            "<b>And Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>those</b> gentiles <b>who construct pens</b> for their animals <b>inside the</b> city <b>limits</b> and charge a fee to bring their animals through the fields around the city to fertilize the fields, it is <b>prohibited to purchase</b> animals <b>from them. What is the reason?</b> It is <b>because the livestock of the</b> Jewish residents of the <b>town become intermingled with their</b> livestock, and it is possible that the animal one would buy is actually stolen property.",
            "Rava adds: If the pens were <b>outside the</b> city <b>limits,</b> it is <b>permitted to purchase</b> livestock <b>from them,</b> as it is unlikely that a Jew’s livestock became intermingled with the seller’s livestock. <b>Ravina said: If the owners</b> of the livestock <b>were pursuing</b> the animals, then <b>even</b> if the pens were <b>outside the</b> city <b>limits, it is prohibited</b> to purchase livestock from the owners of the pens.",
            "§ Apropos the discussion of legal dealings between Jews and gentiles, the Gemara relates: <b>Rava declared, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rav Huna</b> who declared: All <b>who ascend upward</b> to Eretz Yisrael <b>and</b> all who <b>descend downward</b> to Babylonia agree that in the case of <b>a Jew who knows</b> of <b>evidence concerning</b> the legal claim of <b>a gentile, and</b> the gentile <b>did not demand from him</b> that he testify, <b>and</b> the Jew nevertheless <b>went and testified for him in a gentile court, against his fellow Jew, we excommunicate him. What is the reason</b> that we excommunicate him? It is <b>because they,</b> the gentile courts, <b>expropriate money</b>"
        ],
        [
            "based <b>on the word of one</b> witness, which is insufficient evidence according to Jewish law. <b>And we said</b> that this is so <b>only</b> when <b>one</b> individual testifies alone against his fellow Jew, <b>but when two</b> witnesses testify against a Jew, we do <b>not</b> excommunicate them, as their testimony is sufficient evidence according to Jewish law as well, and they have not caused the defendant any unjustified financial loss even according to <i>halakha</i>. <b>And</b> in a case of <b>a single</b> witness <b>also, we said</b> that we excommunicate him <b>only</b> if he testified <b>in a court of villagers [<i>demagista</i>], but</b> if he testified in <b>the</b> official government <b>courthouse [<i>bei davar</i>],</b> he is not excommunicated. This is because <b>they also prescribe an oath to</b> the defendant based on the testimony of <b>a single</b> witness, but they do not expropriate money, in accordance with Jewish law.",
            "The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Ashi said: When I was in the academy of Rav Huna,</b> the following <b>dilemma was raised before us:</b> What is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to an <b>important person,</b> whose testimony <b>is relied upon</b> by the gentile courts <b>as</b> if it were the testimony of <b>two</b> witnesses? Since the gentile court will <b>expropriate money</b> based <b>on his word,</b> should the <i>halakha</i> be that <b>he should not testify? Or perhaps, since he is an important person, he cannot escape</b> the authorities who demand his testimony, <b>and he may</b> therefore <b>testify.</b> The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.",
            "§ The Gemara cites another situation where a Jew is excommunicated for causing harm to another Jew. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> In the case of <b>a Jewish man who sells a gentile</b> a plot of <b>land</b> that is <b>on the border of</b> the property of <b>his fellow Jew, we excommunicate him. What is the reason? If we say</b> it is <b>because</b> he has ignored <b>the right of one</b> whose field <b>borders</b> the field of his neighbor to be the first one offered the purchase of the field, <b>but doesn’t the Master say:</b> With regard to <b>one who purchases</b> land <b>from a gentile, and one who sells</b> land <b>to a gentile, there is no right of one</b> whose field <b>borders</b> the field of his neighbor to be the first one offered the purchase of the field?",
            "<b>Rather,</b> it is <b>because we say to him</b> on behalf of the owner of the adjacent field: <b>You have placed a lion,</b> i.e., a dangerous individual, <b>on my border,</b> as the gentile might now cause me harm. Consequently, <b>we excommunicate him until he accepts upon himself</b> responsibility for <b>all harm that comes</b> upon the neighbor <b>due to</b> the gentile’s activities.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>customs collectors took one’s donkey and gave him a different donkey</b> that was taken from another Jew in its stead, or if <b>bandits took his garment and gave him a different garment</b> that was taken from a Jew in its stead, <b>these</b> items <b>are</b> now <b>his because the owners despaired of</b> retrieving <b>them</b> when they were stolen, and they may therefore be acquired by another. In a case of <b>one who salvages</b> items <b>from a river, or from a troop [<i>hagayis</i>]</b> of soldiers, <b>or from bandits, if the owners</b> of the items <b>despaired</b> of retrieving them, <b>they are his,</b> i.e., they belong to the one who salvaged them. <b>And so too,</b> with regard to <b>a swarm of bees, if</b> the owners <b>despaired</b> of retrieving the bees, <b>they are his,</b> i.e., they belong to the one who found them.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka said: A woman or a minor,</b> whose testimony is not generally accepted by the court, <b>is deemed credible to say:</b> It was <b>from here that this swarm emerged,</b> and it therefore belongs to a certain individual. <b>And</b> one <b>may walk into another’s field</b> in order <b>to salvage his</b> own <b>swarm</b> of bees that has relocated there, <b>and if he damaged</b> some property in the process, <b>he must pay</b> for <b>what he has damaged. But</b> if the bees settled on a branch of a tree, <b>he may not cut</b> off the other’s <b>branch</b> in order to take the bees, even <b>on the condition</b> that he will later <b>give him the money</b> for it. <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says: He may even cut</b> off the branch <b>and</b> later <b>give</b> him <b>the money</b> for it as compensation.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that one who is given an item by a customs collector or a bandit may keep the item. It was <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If he took</b> a donkey from the customs collector, <b>he</b> must <b>return</b> it <b>to the original owners.</b> The Gemara explains: The <i>tanna</i> of this <i>baraita</i> <b>holds</b> that <b>despair alone does not effect</b> legal <b>acquisition.</b> Consequently, the customs collector did not acquire the donkey, <b>and it initially came into the possession</b> of the individual to whom the customs collector gave it <b>illegally,</b> and he is therefore required to return it to the original owner.",
            "<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> means that <b>if he</b> wants to act beyond the letter of the law and <b>comes to return it</b> voluntarily, he should <b>return it to the original owners,</b> but he is not required to return it. <b>What is the reason</b> that he is not required to return it? It is because <b>despair alone effects</b> legal <b>acquisition</b> and the donkey was, therefore, acquired by the Jew when the customs collector gave it to him. <b>Nevertheless, if he said: I do not want</b> to accept <b>money that is not mine, he returns</b> it <b>to the original owners.</b>",
            "§ The mishna teaches that if customs collectors or bandits replaced one’s item with one taken from another Jew, <b>these</b> items <b>are</b> now <b>his because the owners</b> despaired of retrieving them when they were stolen. In this regard, <b>Rav Ashi says: They taught</b> that the owners certainly despaired of recovering their property <b>only</b> when it was stolen by <b>a gentile bandit, but</b> if it was taken by <b>a Jewish bandit, no,</b> the owner did not necessarily despair of recovering it. This is because the victim of the theft might <b>reason: Tomorrow, I will take him to court</b> and force him to return what he stole.",
            "<b>Rav Yosef objects to this: On the contrary, the opposite is</b> more <b>reasonable:</b> When dealing with <b>gentiles, who judge</b> a case and impose their verdicts <b>with force, he does not despair</b> because he realizes that the gentile court will enforce the law. By contrast, when dealing with <b>a Jew, since</b> Jewish courts merely <b>pronounce a verbal</b> decision but do not have the authority to enforce it, the victim <b>despairs</b> of recovering his property.",
            "<b>Rather, if</b> Rav Ashi’s distinction <b>was stated, it was stated with regard to the latter clause</b> of the mishna, which states: In the case of <b>one who salvages</b> an item <b>from gentiles or from bandits,</b> if the owners despaired of retrieving it, the one who finds it may keep it. The Gemara infers: <b>If</b> it is known that <b>the owners despaired</b> of retreating it, <b>yes,</b> the finder may keep the item; but in <b>an unspecified</b> situation, where it is not known whether the owners despaired, the finder may <b>not</b> keep the item.",
            "Concerning this, Rav Ashi said: <b>They taught</b> this <b>only</b> when the item was stolen by <b>a gentile</b> bandit, <b>because</b> the gentile court <b>judges</b> a case and imposes its verdict <b>with force,</b> and therefore it cannot be assumed that the owners despair. <b>But</b> if the robbery was committed by <b>a Jewish bandit, since</b> Jewish courts merely <b>pronounce a verbal</b> decision but do not have the authority to enforce it, the victim <b>despairs</b> of recovering his property.",
            "§ Apropos the discussion with regard to an owner’s despair of retrieving a lost or stolen item, the Gemara notes that <b>we learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Kelim</i> 26:8): With regard to <b>hides</b> that are tanned by the <b>owner</b> himself, <b>thought renders them susceptible to ritual impurity.</b> Hides and leather are susceptible to contracting impurity only if they are in a finished state. If a private individual uses a piece of hide or leather for a certain purpose, e.g., as a cot or a table top, and decides that this will be its fixed purpose, it is considered a finished product and is susceptible to contracting impurity.",
            "<b>But</b> with regard to hides <b>belonging to a leatherworker, thought does not render them susceptible to ritual impurity.</b> Since this individual sells leather to others, when he uses a piece of leather for a household purpose and decides that this will be its fixed purpose, it is not considered a finished state, as he is likely to change his mind and sell the leather to one who will process it further and put it to a different use.",
            "The mishna continues: If the hides are those <b>of a thief,</b> who has stolen them from another, the thief’s <b>thought renders them susceptible to ritual impurity.</b> If they are those <b>of a robber,</b> his <b>thought does not render them susceptible to ritual impurity,</b> because he is not considered the owner of the hide. The difference is that unlike the case of a thief, who steals items stealthily, the identity of a robber, who takes the item openly, is known to the owner, and he harbors hope of finding him and getting the item back. Consequently, he does not despair of recovering his property.",
            "<b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> that <b>the matters are reversed:</b> In the case <b>of a robber,</b> the robber’s <b>thought renders them susceptible to ritual impurity.</b> If the hides are those <b>of a thief, thought does not render them susceptible to ritual impurity, because the owners have not despaired</b> of recovering them and the thief has not acquired the hide. Rabbi Shimon’s reasoning is that a robber, who seizes items brazenly, is a more difficult criminal to apprehend and bring to justice than a thief.",
            "The Gemara analyzes the scope of the dispute between Rabbi Shimon and the first <i>tanna</i>. <b>Ulla says: The dispute</b> is only with regard <b>to an unspecified</b> case, where it is unknown whether or not the owners despaired, <b>but where it is known</b> that the owners despaired, <b>all agree</b> that their <b>despair</b> effects legal <b>acquisition.</b> By contrast, <b>Rabba says:</b> Even in cases <b>where it is known</b> that the owners despaired, there is <b>also a dispute,</b> because although the owner may have expressed despair verbally, he may still hope to retrieve the item.",
            "<b>Abaye said to Rabba: Do not disagree with Ulla, as</b> the formulation of the <i>halakha</i> that <b>we learned in the mishna</b> is <b>in accordance with his</b> opinion. The mishna states that according to Rabbi Shimon, thought does not render the hides of a thief susceptible to ritual impurity <b>because the owners did not despair</b> of retrieving them, and therefore the hides do not belong to the thief. This indicates that <b>the reason</b> the thought of the thief does not render the hides susceptible to ritual impurity <b>is that the owners did not despair</b> of retrieving them. <b>But</b> if <b>the owners</b> had <b>despaired</b> of retrieving them, then <b>these</b> items would be <b>his,</b> and his thoughts would render the hides susceptible to ritual impurity.",
            "Rabba <b>said to him: We learned</b> the mishna as saying: A thief cannot render the hides susceptible to ritual impurity <b>because there is no</b> true <b>despair for owners</b> of stolen goods, even if they state they have despaired.",
            "<b>We learned</b> in the mishna here that if <b>customs collectors took one’s donkey</b> and replaced it with a donkey taken from another Jew, or if bandits took his garment and replaced it with a garment taken from another Jew, he may keep these items because the owners despaired of retrieving them when they were stolen. The Gemara asks: <b>Whose</b> opinion is expressed in this mishna?",
            "<b>If</b> it is in accordance with <b>the Rabbis,</b> who hold that the owner despairs only in the case of a thief who steals secretly, it <b>is difficult,</b> because the mishna indicates that the victim of <b>a robber</b> also despairs of retrieving his property, as in the case of a customs collector. And <b>if</b> it is in accordance with <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who holds that the owner despairs only in the case of a robber, it <b>is difficult,</b> because the mishna indicates that the victim of <b>a thief</b> also despairs of retrieving his property, as in the case of bandits.",
            "<b>Granted, according to Ulla, who says</b> that all agree that if <b>it is known</b> that the owners despaired, the individual in possession of the items <b>acquires</b> them, <b>here too</b> it is possible to explain that the mishna is discussing a case <b>where it is known</b> that the owners despaired, <b>and all agree</b> that the recipient of the stolen property may keep it.",
            "<b>But according to Rabba, who says</b> that even in cases <b>where it is known</b> that the owners despaired, there is <b>also a dispute,</b> in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna written? <b>It is not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, and it is not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b> The Gemara answers that the mishna is discussing a case of <b>an armed bandit,</b> who is similar to a robber in that he steals using force and aggression. <b>And it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who holds that the victim of a robber despairs of recovering his property.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so, this is</b> identical to the case of <b>a robber,</b> i.e., the customs collector, and there is no reason for the mishna to teach the same <i>halakha</i> twice. The Gemara answers that the mishna in fact teaches the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>two</b> different <b>types</b> of <b>robbers,</b> the customs collector and the armed bandit.",
            "The Gemara suggests another proof with regard to the dispute between Ulla and Rabba. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a thief, a robber, and one who forces</b> another to sell him some-thing, <b>their consecrated items are</b> considered <b>consecrated, and their <i>teruma</i>,</b> the portion of the produce designated for the priest, <b>is</b> considered <b><i>teruma</i>, and their tithes are</b> considered <b>tithes.</b>",

            "Having mentioned a case of offhand remarks, the Gemara states that <b>Rav Ashi says:</b> Information gleaned from <b>one who speaks offhandedly is valid only with regard to testimony</b> enabling <b>a woman</b> to remarry, as the Sages were lenient and decreed that the incidental remarks of certain individuals who are not eligible to serve as witnesses may be relied upon in such a case.",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is there <b>no</b> case where offhand remarks expressed by those who are ineligible to testify in court would be accepted <b>by Torah law?

            "Rav Ashi answers: Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi granted him the right to partake of produce that is <b><i>teruma</i></b> only <b>by rabbinic law,</b> as he holds that the requirement to separate <i>teruma</i> after the destruction of the Temple is by rabbinic law. One can still posit that offhand remarks made by individuals who are ineligible to testify in court are not deemed credible with regard to Torah law.",

            "The Gemara concludes the statement of Rav Dimi and explains the challenge: <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>married her to a priest</b> based <b>on his statement.</b> Since it is prohibited by Torah law for a priest to marry a woman who has engaged in sexual intercourse with a man forbidden to her by Torah law and with whom she cannot establish a marital bond, e.g., a gentile, it is clear that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi relied on an offhand remark even with regard to a prohibition by Torah law.",
            "The Gemara answers: The Sages <b>were lenient with regard to a captured woman.</b> By Torah law, a woman taken captive may be presumed to remain permitted to a priest, and it is the Sages who decreed that she is forbidden due to the concern that she was raped. It is this rabbinic decree that may be disregarded on the basis of offhand remarks.",

            "§ Having assessed the mishna’s ruling with regard to a case where the thief remained unidentified, the Gemara discusses a case where the thief was found. <b>It was stated:</b> In a case where a thief <b>stole</b> an item <b>and sold</b> it, <b>and later the thief was identified, Rav says in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya:</b> The homeowner’s <b>claim</b> can be pursued only <b>with the first</b> one, i.e., the thief, but he has no claim against the purchaser. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Yannai:</b> The homeowner’s <b>claim</b> can also be pursued <b>with the second</b> one, i.e., with the purchaser.",

            "Rav Yosef continues: <b>And both</b> Rav and Rabbi Yoḥanan have accepted as <i>halakha</i> <b>the ruling of Rav Ḥisda</b> (111b), that if the owner had not yet despaired of retrieving his item, he can press his claim against either the thief or the purchaser.",

Isn’t</b> a case involving <b>gifts</b> to which members <b>of the priesthood</b> are entitled <b>comparable</b> to a case of a stolen item that was sold <b>before</b> the onset of the owner’s <b>despair,</b> as the priest still hopes to receive the gifts, <b>and</b> yet Rav and Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>disagree</b> with regard to their legal status? This is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ḥullin</i> 132a): If <b>one said to</b> a butcher: <b>Sell me the innards of a cow, and the gifts of the priesthood were in them,</b> the purchaser <b>must give</b> the gifts <b>to a priest, and</b> he <b>may not deduct</b> the value of the gifts <b>from the money</b> he agreed to pay the butcher.

Similarly, in the case of the mishna he would hold that the owner can press his claim only against the thief and not against the purchaser.",
            "The Gemara refutes Abaye’s objection: <b>Say</b> that Rav meant that the priest can <b>even</b> pursue his <b>claim with the butcher,</b> although he is certainly able to claim the gifts from the purchaser. And Rav had to teach this <b>lest you say</b> that <b>gifts of the priesthood are not</b> considered to have been <b>stolen</b> even if the butcher sells them, because wherever they are they remain the legal property of the priests. Rav therefore <b>teaches us</b> that they are considered to have been stolen in this case, and therefore the priest can press his claim against the butcher.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according <b>to Abaye, who said</b> that Rav and Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>disagree, with regard to what</b> do they <b>disagree?</b> The Gemara answers: They disagree <b>with regard to</b> the ruling <b>of Rav Ḥisda.</b> Rav disagrees with Rav Ḥisda and rules that one is entitled to collect only from the thief, while Rabbi Yoḥanan accepts the ruling of Rav Ḥisda and allows one to collect from either the thief or the purchaser.",
            "The Gemara presents another explanation of the dispute between Rav and Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>Rav Zevid said</b> that both agree that if the owner has not yet despaired of retrieving his item, he can press his claim against either party. They disagree in a case <b>where the owners despaired</b> of retrieving it only after the item was already <b>in the possession of the purchaser, but they did not</b> yet <b>despair</b> when it was <b>in the possession of the thief.</b>",
            "<b>And it is with regard to this</b> that <b>they disagree:</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>holds</b> that if there is <b>despair</b> on the part of the owner <b>and afterward</b> there is <b>a change in possession</b> of a stolen item, e.g., it leaves the possession of the thief and enters the possession of a purchaser, the purchaser <b>acquires</b> the item. By contrast, if there is first <b>a change in possession</b> of a stolen item <b>and afterward</b> there is <b>despair</b> on the part of the owner, then the purchaser does <b>not acquire</b> the item. Since in this case the owner did not despair until after the change of possession from the thief to the purchaser, the purchaser did not legally acquire the item, and the owner can press his claim against him. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rav, <b>holds</b> that there <b>is no difference</b> whether the despair or change of possession came first. As long as the owner has despaired of recovering his item, it becomes the property of the purchaser, and the owner cannot demand that he return it.",
            "The Gemara presents a third explanation of the dispute: <b>Rav Pappa said</b> that <b>with regard to</b> a stolen <b>cloak</b> itself, <b>everyone agrees that it</b> must be <b>returned</b> by the purchaser <b>to its owner. But here, it is with regard to</b> whether the Sages <b>implemented the provision</b> ensuring <b>the integrity of the marketplace in this</b> case that Rav and Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>disagree.</b>",
            "<b>Rav says in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> that <b>the claim</b> can be pursued only <b>with the first</b> one, i.e., the thief, meaning that <b>the law with regard to the purchaser</b> is <b>that,</b> after returning the item to its owner, <b>he can collect money</b> only <b>from the thief, and</b> the Sages <b>did not implement the provision</b> ensuring <b>the integrity of the marketplace in this</b> case. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Yannai</b> that <b>the claim</b> of the purchaser can be pursued <b>with the second one,</b> meaning that <b>the law with regard to the purchaser</b> is that <b>he can</b> also <b>collect</b> the <b>money from the owner</b> when he returns the item to him, <b>and</b> the Sages <b>did implement the provision</b> ensuring <b>the integrity of the marketplace in this</b> case.",

Evidently, Rav’s own student held that the Sages did allow a purchaser to claim reimbursement from the owner.",
            "The Gemara answers that <b>Ḥanan the Wicked is different.

            "<b>Rava says: If he is a well-known thief,</b> the Sages <b>did not implement the provision</b> ensuring <b>the integrity of the marketplace in this</b> case.

            "§ The Gemara continues to examine the provision ensuring the integrity of the marketplace. <b>It was stated:</b> With regard to one who <b>stole and repaid his debt</b> with the stolen item, or one who <b>stole and repaid his</b> debt from <b>credit</b> that was extended to him with the stolen item, the Sages <b>did not implement the provision</b> ensuring <b>the integrity of the marketplace in this</b> case, <b>as they say</b> to the creditor: <b>It was not with the expectation of</b> receiving <b>these</b> stolen items <b>that you gave</b> the debtor <b>anything.</b>",

            "The Gemara discusses the continuation of the <i>baraita</i> cited previously: <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>But with regard to oil, he should not do so, due to the priest’s loss.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about a leaking barrel of impure <b>oil,</b> which one may not separate as <i>teruma</i>, because if he does so the priest will suffer a loss?

            "The Gemara answers: <b>Here we are dealing with new</b> wine that has not yet developed an aroma and is therefore not fit for sprinkling.

            "§ Apropos the episode involving Rav Safra, the Gemara discusses the division of expenses among travelers in a caravan. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a caravan that was traveling in the desert and a troop</b> of bandits <b>stood over it</b> in order <b>to</b> attack and <b>pillage</b> it, and the members of the caravan agreed to pay ransom to the bandits, they <b>calculate</b> each traveler’s contribution <b>according to</b> the amount of <b>money</b> he is carrying, <b>and</b> they <b>do not calculate according to</b> the number of <b>souls</b> in the caravan, i.e., the expense is not divided equally among the travelers.",

Consequently, <b>even</b> in the <b>first clause,</b> the <i>halakha</i> should <b>also</b> be that the possessions are saved <b>for himself,</b> so that he is their legal owner. Why is there a discrepancy between the <i>halakha</i> in the first clause and the <i>halakha</i> in the latter clause?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rami bar Ḥama said: Here,</b> in the case of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>we are dealing with</b> a caravan whose members are <b>partners</b> and jointly own the confiscated property, <b>and</b> in a case <b>such as this, a partner may divide</b> the property <b>without the other</b> partner’s <b>consent.</b> Therefore, if <b>he said</b> that he intends to save the property for himself, <b>he has</b> dissolved the partnership and <b>divided</b> the property so that if he is able to rescue only some of the property, the property he rescues is his share of the joint property. If <b>he did not say</b> that he intends to save the property for himself, <b>he has not divided</b> the property, and whatever he rescues is jointly owned by the partners.",
            "<b>Rava stated</b> a different answer: <b>Here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>we are dealing with laborers</b> who were hired to protect the caravan, and one of these guards saved the travelers’ property. <b>And it is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, as Rav says: A laborer may retract</b> his commitment to his employer <b>even in the middle of the day.</b>",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>As long as he did not retract</b> his commitment, he is <b>considered</b> to be under the <b>jurisdiction of the employer,</b> so that anything he saves automatically belongs to the employer. <b>And when he retracts</b> his commitment, <b>it is</b> for <b>a different reason</b> that he is able to do so, <b>as it is written: “For unto Me the children of Israel are servants”</b> (Leviticus 25:55), indicating that Jews are servants of God, <b>but not servants of servants,</b> i.e., of other Jews. Consequently, it is permitted for a laborer to conclude his term of employment whenever he wants. Once he does so, if he saves property that the members of the caravan are unable to rescue, the property belongs to him.",
            "<b>Rav Ashi stated</b> another answer: The <i>baraita</i> is discussing a case <b>where</b> the other members of the caravan are <b>able to rescue</b> the property <b>with difficulty.</b> Therefore, if <b>he revealed his intention</b> to rescue the property for himself and the other travelers did not protest, it is clear that they have despaired of recovering their property, and the rescuer has secured the property <b>for himself.</b> If he <b>did not reveal his intention</b> to rescue the property for himself, the status quo remains and the property has been rescued <b>for the common</b> good.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In a case of <b>one who robs a field from an-other and thugs [<i>massikin</i>]</b> subsequently <b>take</b> the field from the robber, the <i>halakha</i> is dependent upon the circumstances: <b>If it is a regional disaster</b> in which the thugs seize all the property in the region, the robber <b>says to</b> the owner of the field: <b>That which is yours is before you,</b> i.e., it is your prerogative to try to reclaim it from the thugs. No compensation is required since the thugs would have seized the property in any event. But <b>if</b> the thugs took that field alone <b>due to the robber,</b> the robber is <b>obligated to provide</b> the owner with <b>a different field.</b>",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: One who teaches</b> the mishna using the term <b><i>massikin</i> does not err, and one who teaches</b> the mishna using the term <b><i>matzikin</i></b> also <b>does not err,</b> as both terms may be used to refer to thugs. <b>One who teaches</b> the mishna using the term <b><i>matzikin</i> does not err, as it is written: “In the siege and in the distress [<i>matzok</i>]</b> with which your enemies shall distress you” (Deuteronomy 28:55). Consequently, <i>matzikin</i> are individuals who cause distress to others.",
            "<b>And one who teaches</b> the mishna using the term <b><i>massikin</i> does not err, as it is written:</b> “All your trees and the fruit of your land <b>shall the locust consume”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:42), <b>and,</b> in the standard Aramaic translation, <b>we translate</b> this phrase as: <b>Shall the locust [<i>sakke’a</i>] consume.</b> Consequently, <i>massikin</i> are those who consume the property of others.",
            "§ The mishna teaches: <b>If</b> the thugs took the field <b>due to the robber,</b> the robber is <b>obligated</b> to provide the owner with a different field. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of the case in the latter clause of the mishna? <b>If we say</b> that <b>they seized</b> only <b>his land,</b> i.e., the robber’s land, <b>and did not seize all</b> the other <b>lands</b> in the region, <b>you already learned this from the first clause</b> of the mishna: <b>If it is a regional disaster</b> in which the thugs seize all the property in the region, the robber is not obligated to compensate the owner of the field, which indicates that <b>if it is not</b> a regional disaster, the robber is <b>not</b> exempt from payment. What novelty does the latter clause teach?",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for a case <b>where</b> the individual did not actually take control of the property before it was seized by the thugs, but rather <b>showed</b> the field to the thugs and thereby facilitated their occupation of the field. <b>A different version</b> of this answer is as follows: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> A case <b>where gentiles coerced</b> someone <b>and told him to show them his land</b> for them to seize, <b>and he showed</b> them <b>that</b> field belonging to another, <b>along with</b> his own fields, and the thugs then seized all the land he showed them.",
            "The Gemara recounts a related incident: There was <b>a certain man who showed piles of wheat,</b> belonging <b>to the Exilarch’s household,</b> to thugs, who seized them. The case <b>came before Rav Naḥman</b> for judgment, and <b>Rav Naḥman deemed</b> that man <b>liable to pay</b> the Exilarch for the stolen wheat. <b>Rav Yosef was sitting behind Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya, and Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya was sitting before Rav Naḥman.

            "Rav Naḥman <b>said to him:</b> This individual’s liability <b>is</b> written explicitly in <b>the mishna,</b> i.e., it is the <i>halakha</i>, <b>as we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>If</b> thugs took the field <b>due to the robber,</b> he is <b>obligated to provide</b> the owner with a different <b>field.

        [
            "<b>if</b> it is <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> or <b>if</b> it is <b>a fine?</b> Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya <b>said to him: If</b> it is <b>the <i>halakha</i>, we learn from it</b> and apply this ruling to other cases, but <b>if</b> it is <b>a fine, we do not learn from it,</b> as it is possible that Rav Naḥman had a specific reason to impose a fine in this case.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do you say that we do not learn from</b> the imposition of <b>a fine</b> in one case and apply the ruling in other cases? The Gemara answers that the source is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Initially,</b> the Sages <b>would say</b> that <b>one who renders</b> another’s food <b>ritually impure,</b> thereby rendering it unfit for him to consume, <b>and one who pours</b> another’s wine as <b>a libation</b> for idol worship, thereby rendering it an item from which deriving benefit is prohibited, are liable to pay the owner for the financial loss they caused despite the fact that damage is not evident. <b>Subsequently,</b> they added to this list, <b>to say</b> that <b>even one who intermingles</b> <i>teruma</i>, the portion of the produce designated for the priest, with another’s non-sacred produce, thereby rendering the non-sacred food forbidden to non-priests, is liable to compensate the owner for the loss of value of the produce, as fewer people will be willing to buy it from him.",
            "The Gemara comments: It may be inferred from the <i>baraita</i> that it is only because the Sages <b>subsequently</b> added to the list that <b>yes,</b> one who intermingles <i>teruma</i> with another’s non-sacred produce must compensate him. But if <b>they had not subsequently</b> added to the list, he would <b>not</b> be liable. <b>What is the reason</b> that we do not learn that he is liable from the cases of one who renders another’s food impure or pours wine as a libation for idol worship, as this is also a case in which one causes damage that is not evident? <b>Is it not due to</b> the fact that his payment <b>is a fine, and</b> with regard to <b>a fine, we do not learn from</b> one case that it may be imposed in other circumstances?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> this is not the reason. Rather, <b>initially</b> the Sages <b>maintained</b> that they <b>were concerned</b> with regard <b>to a large</b> financial <b>loss,</b> e.g., the cases of one who renders another’s food impure or pours his wine as a libation for idol worship, but with regard <b>to a small</b> financial <b>loss,</b> e.g., one who intermingles <i>teruma</i> with another’s non-sacred produce, <b>they were not concerned. And ultimately</b> the Sages <b>maintained</b> that they <b>were concerned</b> with regard <b>to a small loss as well</b> and imposed liability.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t the father of Rabbi Avin teach</b> the <i>baraita</i> as follows: <b>Initially they would say</b> that <b>one who renders</b> another’s produce <b>impure and one who intermingles</b> <i>teruma</i> with another’s non-sacred produce are both liable to pay for the financial loss that they caused, despite the fact that the damage is not evident. <b>Subsequently,</b> they added to this list, <b>to say</b> that <b>even one who pours</b> another’s wine as <b>a libation</b> for idol worship is <b>also</b> liable to pay a fine for the loss that he caused. It may be inferred that it is only because the Sages <b>subsequently</b> added to the list, that <b>yes,</b> one who pours the libation is liable. But if <b>they had not subsequently</b> added to the list, he would <b>not</b> be liable.",
            "The Gemara comments: Since one who offers libations for idol worship causes a large financial loss, the rationale offered previously cannot apply to this version of the <i>baraita</i>. Accordingly, <b>what is the reason</b> that the liability for pouring another’s wine as a libation could not be extrapolated from the fine imposed for rendering another’s food impure or intermingling it with <i>teruma</i>? Is it <b>not due to</b> the fact that <b>we do not learn from</b> the imposition of <b>a fine</b> in one case that a fine may be imposed in other cases?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> this is not the reason. Rather, the reason is that <b>initially</b> the Sages <b>held in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Avin, and ultimately they held in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yirmeya.</b>",
            "The Gemara elaborates: <b>Initially they held in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Avin, as Rabbi Avin says:</b> If one stood in the public domain on Shabbat and <b>shot an arrow from the beginning of</b> an area measuring <b>four</b> cubits <b>to the end of</b> an area measuring <b>four</b> cubits, <b>and</b> the arrow <b>tore</b> another’s <b>silks [<i>shira’in</i>] in</b> the course of <b>its travel</b> through the air, the one who threw it is <b>exempt</b> from paying for the cloth. The reason for this is <b>that lifting</b> an item <b>is a necessity for placing</b> it elsewhere, and therefore the entire process, from when one shoots the arrow until it comes to a rest, is considered to be a single act. The one performing it is <b>liable to</b> receive the <b>death</b> penalty for violating Shabbat. One who performs a single act for which he is liable to receive the death penalty and is also liable to pay money receives only the death penalty. Similarly, one who pours another’s wine as a libation for idol worship incurs the death penalty, and is therefore exempt from paying for the wine.",
            "<b>And ultimately they held</b> that the liabilities are not incurred simultaneously, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yirmeya, as Rabbi Yirmeya says: From the time of the lifting,</b> the thief <b>acquires</b> the wine and is therefore immediately <b>liable</b> to pay <b>money to</b> the owner. But <b>he is not liable to</b> receive the <b>death</b> penalty <b>until the time</b> that he pours the <b>libation.</b> Once the Sages concluded that the liabilities are not incurred simultaneously, they ruled that one who pours another’s wine as a libation for idol worship is liable to reimburse him.",
            "§ The Gemara returns to the matter of one who showed another’s field to thugs. <b>Rav Huna bar Yehuda happened</b> to come <b>to</b> the town of <b>Bei Abiyonei</b> and <b>came before Rava,</b> who <b>said to him: Did any</b> legal <b>incident come to you</b> for judgment recently?

            "Rava <b>said to</b> Rav Huna bar Yehuda: <b>Reverse</b> your decision in this <b>case</b> and return the money <b>to its owner,</b> i.e., the thug, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a Jew whom gentiles coerced and,</b> as a result <b>he showed</b> them <b>property</b> belonging to <b>another</b> that the gentiles later seized, he is <b>exempt</b> from reimbursing the owner of the property. <b>But if he</b> actively <b>took</b> the property <b>and gave</b> it to the gentiles <b>by</b> his own <b>hand,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to compensate the owner.",
            "The Gemara adds that <b>Rabba says: If he showed</b> the gentiles the property <b>of his own</b> volition, it is <b>as though he</b> actively <b>took</b> the property <b>and gave</b> it to the gentiles <b>by</b> his own <b>hand,</b> and he is liable to compensate the owner.",
            "The Gemara recounts another incident: There was <b>a certain man that gentiles</b> had <b>coerced and</b> so <b>he showed them the wine of Rav Mari, son of Rav Pineḥas, son of Rav Ḥisda, and</b> the gentiles <b>said to him: Carry</b> the wine <b>and bring it with us.</b> Complying with the gentiles, <b>he carried and brought</b> it <b>with them.</b> The case <b>came before Rav Ashi,</b> and he <b>exempted</b> the man from compensating Rav Mari for the wine.",
            "<b>The Rabbis said to Rav Ashi: But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If</b> he <b>took</b> the property <b>and manually transferred</b> it to the gentiles, he is <b>liable</b> to compensate the owner? Rav Ashi <b>said to them: That statement applies</b> only in a case <b>where</b> the Jew <b>did not bring</b> the gentiles <b>to</b> the property <b>at the outset; but if he brought</b> the gentiles <b>to</b> the property <b>at the outset,</b> it is as though <b>he</b> already <b>burned</b> it, as the gentiles then had access to the property. Since the damage inflicted by the Jew was committed by merely showing the wine to the gentiles, he is exempt from payment even though he later actively carried the wine with his hands.",
            "<b>Rabbi Abbahu raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ashi</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: In a case where <b>a ruffian said to</b> a Jew: <b>Pass me this bundle of grain, or this cluster of grapes, and</b> the Jew <b>passed it to him,</b> the Jew is <b>liable</b> to pay the owner of the grain or the grapes. Since the ruffian was already present, it is evident from this <i>baraita</i> that one who hands over another’s property to a third party is liable despite the fact that the latter already had access to it. Rav Ashi answered: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where</b> the Jew and the ruffian were <b>standing on two</b> different <b>sides of a river,</b> so that the ruffian did not have access to the item when the Jew passed it to him.",
            "The Gemara points out that the language of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is also precise</b> according to this explanation, <b>as it teaches</b> its ruling using the term: <b>Pass,</b> which indicates that the ruffian could not have reached the item himself, <b>and</b> it <b>did not teach</b> using the term: <b>Give,</b> which would indicate that the ruffian was standing next to the other individual. The Gemara concludes: <b>Learn from</b> the language of the <i>baraita</i> that Rav Ashi’s interpretation is correct.",
            "The Gemara relates another incident: There was <b>a certain</b> fishing <b>net over which two</b> people <b>were quarreling. This one said: It is mine, and that one said: It is mine. One of them went and gave it to an officer [<i>lefarhagna</i>] of the king.

Rava said to</b> Abaye: <b>And is it in his</b> power to do so when the ownership of the net is the subject of dispute? <b>Rather, Rava said: We excommunicate him until he brings</b> the net back <b>and stands in court</b> for adjudication.",
            "The Gemara relates another incident: There was <b>a certain man who desired to show another</b> individual’s <b>straw</b> to the gentile authorities, who would seize it. <b>He came before Rav,</b> who <b>said to him: Do not show</b> it <b>and do not show</b> it, i.e., you are absolutely prohibited from showing it. The man <b>said to him: I will show</b> it <b>and I will show</b> it, i.e., I will certainly show it. <b>Rav Kahana was sitting before Rav,</b> and, hearing the man’s disrespectful response, <b>he dislodged</b> the man’s <b>neck from him,</b> i.e., he broke his neck and killed him.",
            "Seeing Rav Kahana’s action, <b>Rav read</b> the following verse <b>about him: “Your sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as an antelope in a net”</b> (Isaiah 51:20). <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>this antelope, once it falls into the net,</b> the hunter <b>does not have mercy upon it, so too</b> with regard to <b>the money of a Jew, once it falls into the hand of gentiles, they do not have mercy upon him,</b> i.e., the Jew. Since gentiles who seek a Jew’s money will kill him in order to seize the property, Rav Kahana acted appropriately when he broke the miscreant’s neck, as he protected the Jew’s property and, by extension, the Jew himself.",

Consequently, according to Rabbi Elazar, land that was stolen is included in the <i>halakhot</i> stated in these verses, and one who steals land must reimburse the field’s owner.",
            "<b>And the Rabbis interpreted</b> these verses according to the hermeneutical principle of <b>generalizations and details.</b> The phrase: <b>“And deal falsely</b> with his neighbor,” is <b>a generalization,</b> while the subsequent phrase: <b>“In a matter of deposit,”</b> is <b>a detail.</b> When the verse then states: <b>“Or anything</b> about which he has sworn falsely, he shall restore it in full,” <b>it</b> has <b>then generalized</b> again.

Furthermore, with regard to <b>those who prune trees, those who prune vines, those who trim shrubs, those who weed plants, and those who hoe vegetables,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is dependent upon the owner’s inclination: <b>When the owner is particular about</b> the plant trimmings, the workers <b>are in</b> violation of a transgression <b>due to</b> the prohibition against <b>robbery</b> if they take the trimmings, but if <b>the owner is not particular about them,</b> then <b>these</b> items <b>belong to</b> the workers.",
            "<b>Rav Yehuda says: Dodder [<i>keshut</i>] and green grain [<i>veḥaziz</i>], are not subject to</b> the prohibition against <b>robbery,</b> as they grow on their own and no one tends to them. But <b>in a place where</b> people <b>are particular</b> about the ownership of dodder and green grain, <b>they are subject to</b> the prohibition against <b>robbery. Ravina said: And the city</b> of <b>Meḥasya is a city where</b> the residents <b>are particular</b> about dodder and green wheat."
