[How is] 'Pain' [evaluated]? - If he burnt him with a spit or [injured him] with a nail, even [if it is was] on his fingernail which is a place where no bruise could be made, it has to be calculated how much a man of equal standing would charge to undergo such pain. [How is] 'Healing' [evaluated]? - If he struck him, he is under obligation to pay [for the victim’s] medical expenses. Should sores [meanwhile] arise on his body, if it was as a result of the wound, the offender would be liable, but if it was not as a result of the wound, he would be exempt.
