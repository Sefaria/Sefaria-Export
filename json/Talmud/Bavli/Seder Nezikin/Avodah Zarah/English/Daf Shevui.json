The testimony they testify about themselves. Therefore testimony is preferable.",

And R. Shimon b. Lakish further said: What is it that is written, “And there was evening and there was morning the sixth day?” (Genesis 1:31). This teaches that God made a condition with the works of creation, saying,  “If Israel accept my Law it will be well, but if not, I shall reduce you to a state of chaos.”",
