            "It was taught: The daughters of Zelophehad were exceedingly wise, knew well how to expound Scripture, and were perfectly virtuous. They were exceedingly wise since they chose to speak at the right time; for just then ... Moses our teacher was engaged in interpreting the section on levirate marriage. So they said, \"If in levirate marriage our status is like that of sons [ie, it is only relevant if a father dies without sons or daughters], , then give us, like a son a possession in the land. If not, then our Mother should be subjected to a levirate marriage. At once, \"Moses brought their cause before the Lord.\" The daughters also knew well how to expound Scripture [learn from the Torah] for they said, \"If our father had a son, we would not have spoken, or even if that son had a daughter, we would not have spoken.\" They were also perfectly virtuous, since they married only men who were worthy of them.\""
