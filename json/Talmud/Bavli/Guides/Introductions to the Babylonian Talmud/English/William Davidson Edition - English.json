            "Introduction to Megillah": [
                "Tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Megilla</span> primarily focuses on explaining all of the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> that apply to the holiday of Purim. Additionally, it devotes considerable space to the general <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of synagogues and Torah readings. ", 
                "The holiday of Purim and its laws are mentioned in the Scroll of Esther but not in the Torah itself, as the events that the holiday commemorates occurred hundreds of years after the giving of the Torah. Although there is a biblical basis for this commemorative holiday, based upon the mitzvot of remembering and defeating Amalek, Purim has a halakhic status in between those of Torah law and rabbinic law, and some of its mitzvot are treated as purely rabbinic enactments. ", 
                "The Purim story took place during the period of exile between the two Temples and is typical of a time of exile: There was a threat to the very existence of the Jewish people due to the arbitrary decision of a foreign ruler. Even the salvation merely removed the threat, but did not substantially change the living conditions of the Jews at that time. Furthermore, both the threat and the salvation came at a time when the Divine Presence was concealed. This is expressed by the Gemara's statement: From where in the Torah is the name Esther derived? As it is stated: “And I will hide [<span class=\"it-text\">haster astir</span>] My face on that day” (Deuteronomy 31:18). ", 
                "The fact that the Divine Presence was concealed does not mean that God did not direct the course of events, but that He did so in a way that was not apparent to all, through events that can be seen as random or natural. This makes the miracle of the Purim story different from other miracles described in the Bible, in which the general rules of nature were overridden and the miracle was therefore evident to everyone. Corresponding to the nature of the miracle, the Megilla does not explicitly mention God at all; it simply records the actions and motives of individuals and explains how the events developed as they did. Consequently, one of the basic goals of celebrating Purim is to reveal that which is hidden by publicizing the miracle. There is a greater command to publicize this miracle than to publicize other, more obvious miracles, and Purim is celebrated in a more joyous manner than other holidays. ", 
                "A further result of the Purim story's taking place during a time of exile relates to the timing of the celebration. Whereas most locations experienced relief on the fourteenth of Adar, the Jews of the capital city of Shushan experienced relief on the fifteenth. In commemoration of this, the Sages declared that Purim must be celebrated on the fifteenth of Adar in Shushan, as well as in any city that was surrounded by a wall in the time of Joshua. The reason that the status of a city is determined by its state at the time of Joshua is in order to emphasize the importance of Eretz Yisrael. ", 
                "The primary manner in which the miracle of Purim is publicized is through the reading of the Megilla, and this tractate devotes considerable attention to the details of this mitzva. The Sages required that one read the Megilla twice, once at night and once by day. They also established additional days when the Megilla may be read, aside from the days mentioned in the Megilla itself. Similarly, the Gemara delineates how the Megilla must be read in public or by a single individual, the languages in which it may be read, who is obligated to hear the reading of the Megilla, and who may read the Megilla for the entire congregation. ", 
                "The other mitzvot of Purim were established in order to make the holiday a particularly joyous occasion, based upon the verse: “That they should make them days of feasting and gladness, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor” (Esther 9:22). The feasting is fulfilled through partaking of a festive meal on Purim. Because it is a day of gladness, it is therefore prohibited to eulogize or to fast on Purim. The phrase “sending portions one to another” is the basis of the requirement for each individual to give gifts of food items to another individual. Furthermore, there is a mitzva to give gifts to the poor so that they too can rejoice fully on Purim. One participates in all of these activities to a greater degree than on other holidays and with a particularly high level of joy. ", 
                "Since tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Megilla</span> devotes significant attention to issues regarding the reading of the Scroll of Esther, it is the only tractate that addresses the subject of a public reading of the Bible in the synagogue. Furthermore, there are four special Torah portions read on Shabbat over the course of the month of Adar, and therefore the Sages saw fit to expand on these themes and to designate this tractate as the primary source of discussion of the laws of Torah readings, as well as the sanctity of the synagogue and the sacred items therein. This includes a discussion of the days when the Torah is read publicly, a ceremony of ancient origin but one that is not mandated by Torah law. The days on which the Torah is read publically are Shabbat, Festivals and commemorative holidays, the New Moon, public fast days, and every Monday and Thursday. There is also a discussion of how many verses must be read, how many individuals are called to read from the Torah, and how the verses are divided among the different readers. There is a further discussion of the <span class=\"it-text\">haftara</span>, the additional reading from the Prophets upon concluding the Torah reading on certain days. ", 
                "Additionally, this tractate addresses a synagogue's status and level of sanctity. Because it is a place designated for public prayer gatherings, it is considered like a mini-Temple. Consequently, comparable to the Temple, one must treat a synagogue with reverence while it is functional and even after it has been destroyed. Nonetheless, there are ways to remove the sanctity of a synagogue, either by transferring that sanctity to another item of equal or greater status, or by selling the synagogue with the agreement of the community and its representatives. ", 
                "Tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Megilla</span> contains four chapters: ", 
                "Chapter One addresses the days when one may read the Scroll of Esther and contains a section of aggadic exposition of the Megilla. It also discusses a number of unrelated topics, which are cited due to the structural similarity between their presentation in the Mishna and the presentation of one of the laws of the Megilla. ", 
                "Chapter Two addresses the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of how to read the Megilla and who may do so for the public. As an extension of this discussion, this chapter also enumerates mitzvot that must be fulfilled specifically during the day or during the night.", 
                "Chapter Three addresses the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of reading the Megilla but is primarily devoted to the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of public Torah readings, public prayer, the <span class=\"it-text\">haftara</span>, and the Aramaic translation of the Torah reading. ", 
                "Chapter Four addresses the sanctity of the synagogue and the Torah scroll, and the reading of special Torah portions in honor of particular days during the year."

                "And that these days shall be remembered and observed throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not cease from among the Jews, nor their memorial perish from their seed. Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote about all the acts of power, to confirm this second letter of Purim. And he sent letters unto all the Jews, to the one hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth, to confirm these days of Purim in their appointed times, as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had ordained for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the fastings and their cry. (Esther 9:28–31)", 
                "This chapter continues the discussion of the reading of the Scroll of Esther. Here, however, the topic is not the proper time for its reading but the manner in which it is read: How it is read, from what kind of text, from which point in the text, by whom, and at what time of day?", 
                "The Scroll of Esther is referred to as a specific document within the Megilla itself. The obligation to read it is learned only from the words: “And that these days shall be remembered” (Esther 9:28), referring to a remembrance read from a written text. Consequently, as we see in this chapter, it is a matter of discussion whether or not the entire scroll must be read to fulfill this obligation. ", 
                "The Scroll of Esther is referred to both as a book, i.e., a biblical text, and as a letter, i.e., an informal document. Consequently, the Rabbis discuss to what extent the scroll of the Megilla must resemble a Torah scroll, whether it must be written with the full accuracy of a Torah, whether or not there is leeway in terms of its reading, and who may read it for the public.", 
                "The time designated for reading the Megilla is Purim day, but no particular time of day is specified for this. Having mentioned this fact, the Mishna tangentially discusses many other mitzvot that are assigned to a specific day but not to any particular time during that day."

                "Although divergent customs exist even nowadays with regard to prayer and public Torah readings, this chapter addressed aspects of these areas where clear halakhic guidelines were established.", 
                "Concerning Torah readings, it was determined that seven readers are called to the Torah on Shabbat; six on Yom Kippur; five on Festivals; four on the intermediate days of Festivals and on New Moons; and three on Monday and Thursday mornings, during the afternoon prayer on Shabbat, and on public fast days. Regular Torah portions have been established for Shabbat mornings. In Eretz Yisrael it was customary to read the entire Torah once every three or three and a half years, whereas in Babylonia it was customary to read the entire Torah every year, a practice that has become adopted universally. On Monday and Thursday mornings and during the afternoon prayer on Shabbat, the beginning of the next week's Torah portion is read. On Festivals, even when they occur on Shabbat, a portion that is related to the Festival is read.", 
                "This chapter also established procedures that apply while reading the Torah. It is prohibited to begin or conclude a reading within three verses of the beginning or end of a paragraph. Blessings are recited before and after the reading. In the time of the <span class=\"it-text\">tanna'im</span>, only the first and last readers recited blessings, but in the time of the <span class=\"it-text\">amora'</span><span class=\"it-text\">im</span> it was established that each reader recites blessings both before and after reading from the Torah.", 
                "Public prayer services, and any ritual that is performed only in public, must be performed in the presence of ten adult males. The main reason for this is that sanctification of God's name must be performed in a dignified manner. ", 
                "In addition to concern for the honor of God, the honor of the congregation must be taken into account as well. Therefore, the Sages issued decrees to ensure that the prayer leader is someone who represents the congregation in a dignified manner. Similarly, there are requirements that govern whether a priest may recite the Priestly Benediction in public.", 
                "The Sages also instituted guidelines due to other reasons. They instituted procedures governing the distribution of honors during the prayer service in order to prevent strife. They prohibited individuals who act in particular ways that indicate they might hold heretical views from serving as prayer leaders, in order to distance the community from these views. And they decreed that certain portions of the Bible not be read or translated publicly, as these portions may reflect poorly on the leaders of the nation when they are not accompanied by a proper explanation, which it is not always possible to provide in the context of a public Torah reading."

            "Summary of Perek II": [
                "The <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> requires that the Scroll of Esther be read in order. Having noted this fact, the Gemara then discussed other texts and formulas that must be recited in their proper order. ", 
                "Although the Megilla must be written like a book, i.e., like a Torah scroll, when it comes to reading it, it has many characteristics of a less formal letter or document. Some of the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> established for reading the Torah are not followed for the reading of the Megilla. Someone who is not completely mentally competent may not read the Megilla for others. Although several Sages prescribed shorter or longer excerpts of the Megilla as the minimum to fulfill the obligation of reading, the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> is established that it must be read in its entirety.", 
                "The obligation to hear the Megilla during the day extends to the entire day, and similarly the nighttime reading may be done at any time during the night. This is in fact a principle: Any daytime mitzva can be performed at any time during the day, and a nighttime mitzva can be performed at any time during the night. Although there are recommended times for performing some of these mitzvot, these are given only to prevent their being neglected or to encourage alacrity in their performance. Technically, the accepted time frame for their performance is throughout the entire corresponding day or night."

And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters to all the Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both near and far, to enjoin them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and the fifteenth day of the same, in each and every year, as the days on which the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month that was turned for them from sorrow to gladness, and from mourning into a good day; that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor.

(Esther 9:27–28)", 
                "From the time of its origin, the holiday of Purim has always been celebrated at different times in different locations. As the Megilla itself states, only “the Jews of the villages, that dwell in the unwalled towns” celebrate Purim on the fourteenth of Adar. On the other hand, residents of walled cities celebrate Purim on the fifteenth of Adar. Additionally, in ancient times the Sages instituted that the Megilla may be read by residents of some locations at other times as well. The residents of villages were permitted to advance the reading of the Megilla to the day of ingathering, the Monday or Thursday preceding the fourteenth of Adar. This allowance was made for the benefit of the villagers, who would customarily travel to the larger towns on these days, when the courts were in session, the markets were open, and the Torah was read during the prayer service. Chapter One addresses the details of this institution, as well as related topics, such as when to read the Megilla when Purim occurs on Shabbat. ", 
                "This chapter will also clarify the criteria for walled and unwalled cities with regard to reading the Megilla. This includes a description of the physical characteristics of a walled city, as well as a discussion of when the city needed to have been surrounded by a wall in order for the Megilla to be read there on the fifteenth of Adar. ", 
                "As a continuation of its discussion of when to celebrate Purim and read the Megilla, this chapter also includes a summary of the differences between the first and second months of Adar with regard to both the reading of the Megilla and the other mitzvot of Purim and the month of Adar. Following this mishna, the chapter includes several other <span class=\"it-text\">mishnayot</span> that follow a similar structure, which is: There is no difference between A and B except for C. These <span class=\"it-text\">mishnayot</span> are related to the previous mishna in form, although they are not thematically connected to the rest of the chapter or to each other. ",

                "This chapter also discussed the leniency allowing villagers to advance their reading of the Megilla to the day of ingathering, the Monday or Thursday market day prior to the fourteenth of Adar, in order to enable the villagers to supply food and drink to the city dwellers on Purim. This leniency for the villagers was annulled at the end of the period of the Mishna; since then, the villages must read the Megilla as in large towns, on the fourteenth of Adar. ", 
                "In order for a city to be considered a walled city for the purposes of reading the Megilla on the fifteenth of Adar, it must have an organized Jewish societal apparatus, including the supporting of ten so-called idlers who study Torah on behalf of the community and are designated to take care of communal needs. The wall around the city must also be from the days of Joshua, and be a real wall, not just a fortification.", 
                "The Gemara also mentioned that in the event that Purim falls out on Shabbat the Megilla cannot be read on its appropriate day, as the Sages feared that one might transport it in a public domain. Therefore, they decreed that the Megilla may not be read on Shabbat. According to our fixed calendar, however, the fourteenth of Adar can never fall on Shabbat, although the fifteenth can. On years when it does the Megilla is read earlier, on the fourteenth, the same day as in unwalled cities. This is the only extant possibility for the Megilla not being read on its appropriate day.",

                "Finally, the chapter quoted numerous homiletical explications of various verses of the Megilla, with a focus on revealing some of the hidden miracles that occurred in the Purim story. These aggadic interpretations also express the divine inspiration inherent in the text of the Megilla, as well as indicate the relationship of the miracle of Purim to the fulfillment of the obligation to destroy Amalek."

                "This chapter opened with a discussion of the sanctity of the synagogue and other sacred items. There is a scale of varying degrees of sanctity for each of them. A Torah scroll is considered to have the highest degree of sanctity. Then, as a general rule, the more similar to, or more closely associated an item is with a Torah scroll, the greater its degree of sanctity. Therefore, items that are used with or for a Torah scroll, such as its wraps or the ark, and similarly other sacred scrolls, all have a high degree of sanctity, albeit not as great as a Torah scroll itself. The synagogue, which merely houses the Torah scroll and provides a place of prayer, has the least degree of sanctity. The Gemara explains that it is permitted to sell or exchange an item of sanctity only in order to procure an item of greater sanctity. ", 
                "Despite its relatively low degree of sanctity, a synagogue is nevertheless afforded the status of a “little sanctuary” (Ezekiel 11:16), and as such one is required to treat it with great reverence. This applies both when the synagogue is still used by the community and even after it has become desolate. Furthermore, even when it is permitted to sell the synagogue, it is permitted to do so only with the consent of the whole community.", 
                "The second major topic of this chapter is the special Torah portions that are read at various occasions during the year. Initially, this chapter focused on the four special portions that are read immediately prior to and during the month of Adar. The goal of these portions is to publicly mention the mitzvot that apply in that month, i.e., the collection of shekels for the Temple and the obligation to recall the destruction of Amalek, as well as to begin to prepare for the upcoming festival of Passover though the reading of the portion beginning “this month” (Exodus 12:2) and that of the Red Heifer. The Gemara established that each portion is to be read before the fulfillment of that mitzva it relates to, in order that the reading may serve as a reminder for the community.", 
                "The chapter then discussed the portions to be read on the special days and Festivals throughout the year. With regard to this, the Gemara pointed out that already in the period of the <span class=\"it-text\">amora'</span><span class=\"it-text\">im</span>, the custom of which portions to read had veered from that which is recorded in the Mishna. And indeed, in the post-talmudic period, the customs changed and developed beyond that which was decided by the Gemara. Nevertheless, this was not considered a breach of authority. Rather, each community with its customs was ultimately seeking to achieve the similar goal of choosing a portion that appropriately expressed the unique character of the day. As such, there is room for variation, and each community should continue to follow the practice of its forebears."

Consequently, it was necessary to establish guidelines concerning the translation of the Torah readings, which prayers could be recited only in public, and the circumstances under which public prayers could be recited.",

In addition, many synagogues were also used as study houses for children and eventually as a place where people would gather to hear words of Torah from the Sages.

What level of decorum is required inside a synagogue, how does one treat the synagogue structure and place after it has been destroyed, what happens to its sanctity when it is sold, and under what circumstances is it permitted to do so? Closely related to this, the chapter also discusses the status of other items that are also endowed with differing degrees of sanctity due to their use and association with the Torah and various mitzvot.",

First discussed are the four special Torah portions read on the <span class=\"it-text\">Shabbatot</span> during and immediately prior to the month of Adar. Which passages of the Torah are selected for those portions, and what are the determining factors regarding which portion is read on which Shabbat?

In the previous chapter, the fundamental parameters of <span class=\"it-text\">Shema </span>were discussed and its framework was established; its component sections, the accompanying blessings and the time frame in which it is recited were discussed. In this chapter, a number of issues are raised with regard to the manner in which the mitzva<span class=\"it-text\"> </span>of<span class=\"it-text\"> Shema </span>is fulfilled, including how one should conduct himself when faced with situations and circumstances that do not enable him to fulfill the mitzva<span class=\"it-text\"> </span>of <span class=\"it-text\">Shema </span>in an ideal manner. Although the various issues have no direct connection to one another, they all revolve around one central theme: What is the scope of the mitzva to recite <span class=\"it-text\">Shema</span>? In order to answer this question, one must answer an even more fundamental question: What is the basic requirement to recite <span class=\"it-text\">Shema</span>? Is there really a distinction between primary and secondary elements within <span class=\"it-text\">Shema</span>? If so, what are the practical ramifications of this distinction?",

What takes precedence? Hindrances of this kind are quite common and can be divided into three categories: those that originate with the person himself, due to physical or spiritual difficulties; those that are caused by other people or the circumstances in which one finds oneself; and those that occur in the course of daily life.",

Or is it a mitzva by rabbinic law, in which case the verses cited by the Sages are merely biblical allusions to support their ordinance? Major differences in halakhic<span class=\"it-text\"> </span>rulings are dependent upon the following basic question: To what extent can other factors, with varying degrees of significance, supersede <span class=\"it-text\">Shema</span>?",

It became clear that the basis of the myriad <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> regarding respect for the dead is the comprehensive principle of maintaining human dignity. Due to that principle, several mitzvot are superseded due to both respect for the dead and human dignity. Several times in this chapter it was emphasized that the deceased should be treated like a person, and that his body is inexorably tied to his eternal soul.",

This ordinance had considerable influence on the life of the Jewish people for several generations, and many of the Sages sought to clarify its practical ramifications. It never achieved widespread acceptance among the Jewish people, and the Sages agreed to abrogate it. Nevertheless, the ordinance remains in effect, even today, as a custom of the pious.",

In this case, the reference is to exposed nakedness in its broadest sense, which includes not only exposure of the specific parts of the body usually associated with that term, but also all body parts that are usually covered.

However, the conclusion reached was that the fourth blessing: Who is good and does good, is a rabbinic addition and the obligation to recite it is not on a par with the obligation to recite the first three blessings. Although their establishment and formulation developed over the course of many generations, their source is the Torah itself.",

There are various details involved in distinguishing between the food items; however, fundamentally the Sages arrived at the following division: Over those items where required gifts were not separated or a required action was not performed but nevertheless there is no prohibition to derive pleasure from them, one may recite a blessing. However, over those items where the failure to separate the gifts or perform the action results in a prohibition to derive pleasure from them, one may neither recite Grace after Meals nor the <span class=\"it-text\">zimmun</span> blessing.

However, in the oral tradition, the obligation to recite <span class=\"it-text\">Shema</span> is derived from these verses. Once this obligation is established, it is incumbent upon us to ascertain how it is to be fulfilled. The obligation of <span class=\"it-text\">Shema </span>involves reciting three sections from the Torah: (1) <span class=\"it-text\">Shema </span>(Deuteronomy 6:4–9); (2) <span class=\"it-text\">VeHaya im Shamoa </span>(Deuteronomy<span class=\"it-text\"> </span>11:13–21); and (3) <span class=\"it-text\">VaYomer </span>(Numbers<span class=\"it-text\"> </span>15:37–41).

Similarly, is “when you arise” referring to the entire period of the day during which people are awake, or is it perhaps referring to the specific hour when each individual awakens?

In the background, the Gemara recounts in great detail the lives of Jews in Eretz Yisrael and Babylonia during the era of the Mishna and the Talmud. It describes their occupations, their prayers, their aspirations, and their dreams, from morning to evening, on weekdays and festivals, in felicitous times and calamitous times, citing numerous halakhic<span class=\"it-text\"> </span>and aggadic sources to enlighten, guide, and explain.", 
                "With all of the different nuances and abundance of detail in the tractate, there is one central, unifying theme that recurs throughout all of the many <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot </span>and aspects touched upon within it, which transforms it into a cohesive unit: The principle that the abstract should be concretized and the sublime realized in a practical, detailed manner.", 
                "This theme is not unique to tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Berakhot</span>; to a certain degree, it appears in every tractate of the Talmud. In fact, it is one of the primary elements of the multifaceted world of <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>. Consequently, it is present in every Jewish literary work throughout history as an internal, essential characteristic. ", 
                "In tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Berakhot,</span> this approach is more intensive and more conspicuous. This is because the theme of the tractate is faith: The total awareness in heart and mind that there is an everlasting connection between the Creator and man and that perpetual inspiration descends from the Creator to the world – inspiration which creates, generates, and sustains. Man reacts, thanking, requesting, praying, anticipating a response; waiting to be blessed, to be cured, for a miracle. This connection of faith, which in and of itself is exalted and sublime, achieves form and clarity when it is transformed into practical <span class=\"it-text\">halakha </span>through the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot </span>of tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Berakhot</span>. Here, faith is manifest in the details of the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span>, in the myriad blessings and in the formulation of prayer. However, alongside the de-emphasis of the abstract, faith as an integral part of real life is enhanced and established. This general consciousness evolves into <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>, guidance how to live one's life.", 
                "The choice in favor of practical manifestation of a concept, despite the rigidity of this form of expression, is multifaceted. The fundamental outlook of Judaism is that the essence of the Torah and the objective of creation are the actualization of the Torah as a living Torah. “It is not in the heavens”;<sup>2</sup> rather, it was given to man and for man. The closer Torah is to man, the more concrete and practical it is, the closer it is to fulfilling its objective.", 
                "Therefore, the primary fulfillment and significance of most concepts in Judaism is when they are manifest in a concrete, practical manner. The manner and style in which they are actualized determine the significance of the concept. Therefore, throughout the generations, <span class=\"it-text\">halakha </span>has never stopped creating. As the structure and circumstances of life change, new forms and styles develop in order to actualize the general, abstract concepts in those specific circumstances.", 
                "Furthermore, faith, despite its broad scope, is not a palpable presence in one's daily life. True, faith as a <span class=\"it-text\">Weltanschauung </span>and as a general approach exists, in one form or another, in the hearts of all people, at different levels of consciousness and acceptance. However, the distance between that faith and real life is too significant. There is no comparison between accepting the fundamental tenets of faith in one's heart and fulfilling them in practice, especially at all of those minor, uninspiring opportunities that constitute a majority of one's life. If the abstract concepts of faith are not manifest in a practical manner in all of the details of a person's life, faith will lose its substance; consequently, all of life's details and actions will be rendered worthless and pointless. Indeed, the fundamental demand of religion is well characterized in the phrase: “If you devote your heart and your eyes to Me, I know that you are Mine.”<sup>3</sup> ", 
                "This issue of connecting abstract faith to real life is manifest in several verses in the Torah. Nowhere is that connection as conspicuous as in the section of <span class=\"it-text\">Shema </span>in Deuteronomy.<sup>4</sup> “Hear, Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One” expresses the fundamental tenet of the Jewish faith; “And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might” expresses the essence of its accompanying feeling. However, together with those abstract ideas, this short section also includes instruction and guidance regarding how to translate them into the world of action: “And you shall teach them diligently unto your children”; “and you shall bind them for a sign upon your hand”; “and you shall write them upon the doorposts of your house.” That is why this section constitutes the spiritual basis for the entire tractate of <span class=\"it-text\">Berakhot</span>. Not only do some of its chapters discuss the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of <span class=\"it-text\">Shema</span>, but other chapters extrapolate from this approach, connecting pristine faith to its actualization by means of the meticulous fulfillment of mitzvot.", 
                "<span class=\"it-text\">Shema </span>consists of three sections<sup>5</sup> which, although they do not appear consecutively in the Torah, combine to form a single, meaningful unit. <span class=\"it-text\">Shema </span>is, first and foremost, a recitation of the fundamental tenets of Judaism. Reciting it each day provides the stabilizing foundation and the guidelines for Jewish life. It is conceivable that reciting <span class=\"it-text\">Shema</span> each morning and evening will not constitute a profound religious experience. However, it is accessible to all, and it provides the Jewish person with the ability to delve into the text and endow all of his thoughts and actions with the essence of <span class=\"it-text\">Shema</span>, thereby fulfilling the contents of those sections in the most profound sense.", 
                "Prayer is substantively different. From the outset, prayer constituted a portal through which one could address God whenever he desired, in times of distress and need as well as times of thanksgiving and gratitude. One's ability to recite his own personal prayer was never restricted. This is optional prayer, in which one pours out his heart before God in his own style and his own words. However, this was insufficient, and therefore, the greatest of the Sages throughout the generations established a set, defined, obligatory formula for prayer, to be recited at fixed times. ", 
                "The establishment of set times for prayer and a set formula common to all has the capacity to crystallize that barely perceptible feeling which exists in the heart of even the simplest person. This is because, although religious feelings exist in the hearts of all people, these feelings are not easily expressed; not every individual is conscious of them, nor does he always understand them. Fixed prayer provides the desired expression, the coherent language for the person unable to appropriately articulate the feelings in his heart.", 
                "Furthermore, the very fact that prayer is, in its essence, communal, makes the person an integral member of the community at large. Each individual considers himself and is considered by those around him as belonging to a broad, all-encompassing world. ", 
                "True, there is concern that the fixed nature of prayer, in terms of both the formula and the times that it may be recited, is liable to compromise the natural connection with God and one's ability to express himself in prayer, and could ultimately become a meaningless verbal framework. Therefore, unlike <span class=\"it-text\">Shema, </span>which one is obligated to recite regardless of the conditions and circumstances, the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha </span>is much more flexible regarding prayer in the sense that one principle supersedes all others: “Do not make your prayer fixed, rather make it a plea for mercy and an entreaty before God.”<sup>7</sup>", 
                "<span class=\"it-text\">Shema </span>and prayer provide a general direction for integrating faith into daily life, with the eighteen blessings of the <span class=\"it-text\">Amida </span>prayer tying the fundamental tenets of faith that appear in <span class=\"it-text\">Shema</span> with all of the unique, specific problems that exist in the life of the Jewish people in general and in the life of each individual Jew in particular.", 
                "Blessings are an additional step in that direction. Tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Berakhot</span> discusses dozens of different types of blessings: Blessings in prayer, blessings of thanksgiving, blessings prior to the performance of mitzvot, blessings over food and delicacies, blessings as expressions of suffering and mourning, and blessings as expressions of joy and wonder. Despite the differences in details, formulas and meaning, there is a common intent to all of the blessings: They are a way of creating a bond of meaning between an action, incident, or object and God. Life is full of directionless, meaningless, purposeless phenomena; the blessing rescues them from that purposelessness, renders them significant, and connects them to their origins and their destiny.", 
                "The profusion of blessings is a result of the need for them; they draw a cloud of grace, sanctity, and meaning over the abundance of different phenomena in the world. Uniformity of formula and of custom can also lead to a general attitude of purposelessness toward the world around us, but the great number of blessings provide each object with a unique character, a significance all its own.", 
                "In addition to the halakhic<span class=\"it-text\"> </span>portion of tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Berakhot</span>, there is also an aggadic<span class=\"it-text\"> </span>portion. If, as mentioned above, the halakhic<span class=\"it-text\"> </span>portion directed us from the abstract to the concrete, the direction provided by the aggadic section is from the concrete to the abstract. As a result, all actions, including the seemingly insignificant details among them, whether from the Torah or from human life, become paradigmatic and teeming with significance and meaning. Even matters that appear to be peripheral or of secondary importance are revealed in all their significance and centrality. Similarly, events that befell people in the distant past now become contemporary and extremely significant. In this way, personalities from the past are integrated in determining the character of the present. Even halakhic<span class=\"it-text\"> </span>patterns – fixed, clearly defined templates – assume profundity and significance in the aggadic<span class=\"it-text\"> </span>sections, in which they are tied to wide-ranging, sublime ideas, biblical verses, and the personalities of the great leaders throughout the generations.", 
                "The numerous aggadic<span class=\"it-text\"> </span>sections in tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Berakhot</span>, as in all other tractates in the Talmud, are intermingled with the halakhic<span class=\"it-text\"> </span>sections; they complement them and add additional perspective. There is no abrupt, disruptive transition between the practical world of <span class=\"it-text\">halakha, </span>which deals with matters that at first glance might seem inconsequential, and the <span class=\"it-text\">aggada, </span>which deals with the sublime mysteries of the world. Heavenly worlds and our world, discussions that delve into the smallest details, and the enigmas of faith are all cited together, as all things that exist in this world, with all of their positive and negative aspects, are one.",

                "Among the more general blessings are: Who has given us life, and: Who is good and does good. These two blessings of thanksgiving are recited each time a person feels that something good has befallen him: A general event like rainfall; a private celebration like the birth of a son; joy over a new acquisition; or even the joy of meeting a friend. Detailed parameters were established in the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> with regard to the time and manner in which these blessings are recited. Nevertheless, the personal feelings and considerations of the one reciting the blessing, who uses it to offer thanks to God, also play a role.", 
                "Another general blessing, which is recited over an entire series of events, is: The true Judge. This blessing is recited as a faith-based acceptance and justification in response to any event involving misfortune or tragedy. Based on the fundamental concept of the mishna, the Gemara emphasizes that not only is there an obligation to recite a blessing over tragic events, but that one should recite the blessing joyfully, motivated by the profound belief that everything the Holy One, Blessed be He does, He does for the best. God's judgment is a true judgment; even though it may not be obvious at present, it is, at its core, a manifestation of good.", 
                "In addition to general blessings, there are several blessings recited only in specific cases. For example: Over God's might in nature: Whose strength fills the world; over the wonders of creation in general: Author of creation; over strange creatures: Who makes creatures different. Some blessings are recited as an expression of sympathy, for example: The true Judge. Others express praise and thanksgiving, for example: Who created beautiful creatures. They all come to underscore that one should view every event and phenomenon encountered in the course of life as an act of God and a manifestation of His will.",

Even where the Gemara did reach a conclusion, the conclusion did not always remain throughout the generations, as rulings in favor of one opinion were changed to favor the other. Consequently, many of the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot </span>remain unresolved even today.",

No clear halakhic<span class=\"it-text\"> </span>ruling was reached regarding this issue. The Gemara's conclusion is: One who practices in accordance with this Sage has fulfilled his obligation, and one who practices in accordance with that Sage has fulfilled his obligation. In other words, the decision remains in the hands of each individual. This lack of clarity blurs the distinction between the times of the afternoon and evening prayers as well as the boundary between the weekday and Shabbat<span class=\"it-text\"> </span>prayers, which are recited during this time frame.", 
                "Another problem resolved in the Gemara concerns the evening prayer. In the dispute over this issue, which led to the temporary dismissal of the <span class=\"it-text\">Nasi</span>, the ruling was that the evening prayer is optional. Nevertheless, the custom adopted by the Jewish people throughout the generations was to treat the evening prayer as an obligation.", 
                "On a similar note, there were two conflicting approaches to the obligation to recite the <span class=\"it-text\">Amida </span>prayer. One approach favored a fixed daily prayer, while the other advocated a prayer whose essence was primarily devotional; any time that a person was unable to pray with all his heart, he would pray an abridged prayer or even not pray at all. The halakhic<span class=\"it-text\"> </span>conclusion took the middle ground. However, fundamentally, even Rabbi Akiva's opinion, which was adopted, accepts the principle that prayer and the language of the prayer are not a fixed obligation; rather, prayer reflects the individual's circumstances and state of mind at the time.", 
                "Sages throughout Jewish history conducted themselves in this manner. Nevertheless, here too the custom adopted by the Jewish people corresponds with the first opinion that one must always recite the complete <span class=\"it-text\">Amida </span>prayer, even when he is incapable of praying with all his heart.

But it shall be, when evening comes on, he shall bathe himself in water; and when the sun is down, he may come within the camp. You shall have a place also without the camp, where you shall go forth abroad. And you shall have a paddle among thy weapons; and it shall be, when you sit down abroad, you shall dig with it, and shall turn back and cover that which comes from you. For the Lord your God walks in the midst of your camp, to deliver you, and to give up your enemies before you; therefore your camp shall be holy; that He see no unseemly thing in you, and turn away from you.

However, there are circumstances which render a person ritually impure or constitute an unclean environment. Precise determinations are necessary to establish when those circumstances completely exempt one from the obligation to recite <span class=\"it-text\">Shema</span> and pray and when the obligation is merely postponed.",

                "In <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>, this was consolidated into three categories: Ritual impurity, unseemly matters, and filth. Ritual impurity is not, in essence, tied to a concrete flaw; nevertheless, it is a spiritual flaw from which it is incumbent upon the person to purify himself before entering the camp. The Torah directive with regard to ritual impurity resulting from a seminal emission leads directly to the discussion of the ordinance instituted by Ezra. This ordinance established that one who is ritually impure due to a seminal emission, including a husband who engaged in conjugal relations with his wife, is forbidden to recite <span class=\"it-text\">Shema</span>, pray, or study Torah until he immerses himself and becomes ritually pure. Even though it never gained widespread acceptance, in many senses several appropriate modes of conduct with regard to caution and ritual purity while studying Torah and praying were established by virtue of that ordinance.",

However, there is another aspect, as it says in the Torah: All nakedness involves contempt for God, and consequently, covering that nakedness is an acknowledgement of the sanctity of the matters in which one is involved.",

However, the nation's elite, <span class=\"it-text\">h</span><span class=\"it-text\">averim </span>and Torah scholars, were always vigilant in their observance of the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot </span>of ritual impurity and observed a standard of purity equal to that observed by priests. The plethora of <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot </span>associated with ritual purity and impurity and the preponderance of rabbinic decrees in that area created a situation where it was necessary to be especially vigilant during every meal in order to avoid both becoming ritually impure himself and making the food ritually impure. Special care was required with regard to liquids, as by rabbinic decree, they become ritually impure by means of contact with any impurity and they then render impure all objects with which they subsequently come into contact. In fact, both Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel seek to minimize as much as possible the potential of a person or food items becoming ritually impure in the course of a meal.",

Although, on the one hand, one derives a modicum of pleasure from the light, due to other considerations, it falls into the category of the blessings discussed in the ninth chapter, blessings of praise and thanksgiving. A person recites the blessing over the very existence of light and not over any direct pleasure or benefit derived from it. Indeed, this dual characteristic stands at the center of the talmudic discussion surrounding the blessing over light."

This analysis, by its very nature, deals with numerous details and specific, defined questions.",

By contrast, the Rabbis ruled in favor of establishing a comprehensive system of blessings that progresses from the general to the specific. ", 
                "Among the general distinctions in this chapter, the most central is the distinction between foods which do not grow in the ground, over which one recites: By Whose word all things came to be, and those which do grow in the ground. Within the latter category, there is a further distinction between fruits over which one recites: Who creates fruit of the ground, and those over which one recites: Who creates fruit of the tree. Furthermore, the Gemara arrives at a definition of the foods over which one recites: Who creates the various kinds of nourishment, i.e., various foods made from grains. A distinction is made between these foods and bread, which is made from the unadulterated five species of grain baked in the form of bread, over which one recites: Who brings forth bread from the earth.

It is recited on weekdays, on Shabbat,<span class=\"it-text\"> </span>and on Festivals. The fundamental question is: What is the source of the <span class=\"it-text\">Amida </span>prayer? Is it tied to <span class=\"it-text\">Shema</span>, the course of a person's daily life, the days that turn into night and vice-versa? Or is the primary element its connection to the sacred service performed in the Temple, serving as a substitute form of worship since its destruction? This dilemma, manifest in the dispute amongst the Sages whether prayer was instituted by the Patriarchs or established parallel to the daily offerings in the Temple, touches upon the different characteristics of prayer and serves as a basis for the halakhic<span class=\"it-text\"> </span>questions discussed in this chapter.", 
                "Clearly, there is a consensus that beyond the essential obligation to pray, the source of which was subject to dispute, the various prayers must be recited at fixed times. It is, then, necessary to ascertain the parameters of those times: When is the earliest and latest time that each prayer can be recited? This is relevant to the morning prayer, which is parallel to the daily offering sacrificed early in the morning when the Temple stood, and to the afternoon prayer, which is parallel to the daily offering sacrificed in the afternoon.", 
                "This close connection between the prayers and the communal offerings was already observed in practice when the Temple stood, as the people would recite a communal prayer together with the sacrifice of the offering. Consequently, there are two prayers that enjoy unique status in the context of this discussion: The additional prayer and the evening prayer.", 
                "The additional prayer was clearly instituted parallel to the offering; there is no other possible explanation. Therefore, its status and the parameters of the time that it may be recited are clearer. Yet specifically for that reason, there is room to consider whether or not this prayer, like the sacrifice after which it was modeled, is a matter exclusively for the community. The question is: May it only be recited in the framework of communal prayer; or, perhaps, may the additional prayer be recited even individually?", 
                "The opposite problem exists with regard to the evening prayer. Since this prayer is not directly parallel to a specific offering, it does not have a set time like the other prayers. On the other hand, in terms of its essence as a prayer recited at night, tied to the changes from day to night and to <span class=\"it-text\">Shema</span> of the day and the night, there is room to stipulate a set time and a fixed obligation as in the case of the other prayers.", 
                "The dispute between the Sages regarding this issue, whose far-reaching consequences will be related in this chapter, constitutes a manifestation of another aspect of the fundamental question: What is the obligation of prayer? Is the primary obligation to recite the prayer communally, with the devotional aspect of prayer secondary in importance? Or, perhaps, the essence of prayer is turning to God, and the primary obligation is in its devotional aspect and the desire to draw closer to God.",

If one's term of naziriteship is negated due to impurity, then following his purification the individual must bring the offerings of an impure nazirite, after which he starts counting his term of naziriteship afresh. Some Sages suggest that those impurities that do not negate the term of a nazirite are those imposed by rabbinic law or those that are due to uncertainty. Consequently, a nazirite with this type of impurity is not punished for entering the Temple or for eating sacrificial meat. Even those who dispute this opinion concede that the details of these <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> were transmitted to Moses from Sinai, although there is textual support for them in the Torah.

If an individual declares his intention to become a nazirite and therefore will refrain from an item that is in fact not forbidden to a nazirite, his statement is treated as a standard vow of prohibition and not as a vow of naziriteship. His use of the phrase: I am hereby a nazirite, is understood to mean only that he is vowing that a particular item is forbidden to him. There are even circumstances in which one may take a vow of naziriteship with regard to wine and it will be interpreted as a standard vow of prohibition, if circumstances indicate that one was merely vowing that a particular glass of wine being offered to him would be forbidden to him.",

He may be obligated to pay for half the offerings of a nazirite, or he might be obligated to pay for all of the offerings. In connection with this topic, the Gemara examines cases where an individual overhears someone vowing to be a nazirite and adds: And I, or: And it is incumbent upon me. Such a person becomes a nazirite despite the brevity of his statement.",

As with other types of vows, one might take a nazirite vow for a variety of reasons, e.g., to be absolved of a sin or to express gratitude to God for His kindness. Alternatively, one might take a nazirite vow in order to merit divine favor as one makes a request of God, or one might take the vow out of anger or spite. At its best, when accepted with pure intentions, naziriteship is considered a way to achieve holiness, as the Torah states: “All the days of his naziriteship he is holy to the Lord” (Numbers 6:8).", 
                "The term nazirite [<span class=\"it-text\">nazir</span>] refers to one who abstains [<span class=\"it-text\">mitnazer</span>] from certain actions. It also alludes to the uncut hair of the nazirite, which is comparable to a crown [<span class=\"it-text\">nezer</span>] (see Numbers 6:7). Although the Torah never establishes a general prohibition against becoming ritually impure or drinking wine, abstaining from these actions is considered a prerequisite for holiness, as demonstrated by the fact that it is prohibited for one to enter the Temple courtyard after drinking wine or while in a state of ritual impurity. Additionally, because of their inherent sanctity, priests are prohibited from becoming impure through contact with a corpse. A nazirite, who voluntarily accepts these prohibitions, is considered to have temporarily elevated himself to a status similar to that of a priest.<sup>2</sup>", 
                "A nazirite is called “a nazirite of God” (Judges 13:5), and the verse praises the Jewish people by saying (Amos 2:11): “And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for nazirites” (see Rambam <span class=\"it-text\">Sefer Hafla'a, Hilkhot Nezirut</span> 10:14). The Rabbis differ with regard to their appraisal of naziriteship. Though according to all it is considered praiseworthy to abstain from contracting impurity and from inebriation, according to some it is considered a transgression to entirely prohibit oneself from becoming impure or from drinking wine. Additionally, sometimes people became nazirites due to ulterior motives or out of spite, and at times nazirites would regret ever having taken a nazirite vow. Under these circumstances, the observance of naziriteship is not considered praiseworthy.",

A nazirite is prohibited from cutting his hair, eating or drinking anything originating from a grapevine, and becoming ritually impure through contact with a corpse. When he completes the term of his naziriteship, he brings a sheep as a burnt-offering, a ewe as a sin-offering, and a ram as a peace-offering, along with unleavened loaves and unleavened wafers. Afterward, he is released from the restrictions of naziriteship. If a nazirite became impure through contact with a corpse during his term of naziriteship, then after completing the standard purification process of sprinkling on the third and seventh days and immersing in a ritual bath, he shaves his hair and on the eighth day brings two doves or pigeons, one for a sin-offering and the other for a burnt-offering, and a sheep in its first year as a guilt-offering. He then must begin his term of naziriteship anew.",

This tractate attempts to explain and clarify the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of naziriteship as they apply in practice.", 
                "One of the main topics of this tractate is the clarification of the ways in which the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of naziriteship conform to or deviate from the general <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot </span>of vows. As explained earlier, acceptance of naziriteship is a form of a vow. There is no obligation to become a nazirite, and naziriteship takes effect only when one willingly takes a nazirite vow. However, unlike a standard vow, the guidelines that pertain to one who takes this vow are not up to the discretion of the individual. The rules that apply to a nazirite have already been determined by the Torah. Therefore, one who takes a nazirite vow is bound by all of the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> incumbent upon a nazirite, even if he states that he is accepting only some of them. However, the duration of the period for which he becomes a nazirite is up to his discretion, provided that it is no less than thirty days.", 
                "Tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Nazir</span> also addresses the language that effects a nazirite vow. When one accepts naziriteship using clear and precise language, the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> is clear. However, sometimes the wording that one uses is so ambiguous and confusing that it must be clarified whether the statement is considered a nazirite vow and how long the term of naziriteship will last. Sometimes, one takes a vow using substitutes for the language of nazirite vows, e.g., by saying the word <span class=\"it-text\">nazik</span> instead of <span class=\"it-text\">nazir</span>, or using intimations of nazirite vows. In these cases, it must be clarified which expressions obligate the speaker in a nazirite vow. Similarly, the implication of one's statement must be determined in cases where it is not clear whether the speaker accepted upon himself a nazirite vow or a different vow, or where he accepted upon himself a partial term of naziriteship. Sometimes, one accepts a nazirite vow conditionally, because of a mistake, as a result of outside intervention, or to demonstrate that he is telling the truth in a different context. In all of these cases, it is necessary to determine whether one has become a nazirite.",

One of these traditions is that an unspecified term of naziriteship lasts for thirty days, which is the minimum term of naziriteship. Another is that one can become a permanent nazirite, in which case he is a nazirite forever but may trim his hair once a year. Additionally, one can become a nazirite like the judge Samson, whereby one is a nazirite for his entire life but with unique <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span>. It is permitted for him to become impure through contact with a corpse but prohibited for him ever to cut his hair or drink wine.",

Additionally, the Gemara must clarify the practical differences between a permanent nazirite; one who takes upon himself a term of naziriteship that will, in practice, last for the duration of his lifetime; and one who takes a vow whereby he is obligated in continuous, consecutive terms of naziriteship.", 
                "Another unique <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> of nazirite vows relates to minors. The <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> is that a father, and only a father, can obligate his son in a vow of naziriteship.

The Torah specifies that “all the days of his vow of naziriteship no razor shall come upon his head” (Numbers 6:5). However, it must be clarified whether this prohibition applies only to one who shaves off all his hair with a razor, as with the prohibition against removing one's beard, or if it applies to any removal of hair. Similarly, it is necessary to clarify how much hair one must remove in order to be liable to receive lashes. The tractate clarifies the circumstances in which one is liable to receive lashes, and whether it is only the nazirite who is liable or also one who cuts the nazirite's hair. Additionally, a variety of circumstances could result in the nazirite's hair being cut. This could occur because the nazirite intentionally or accidentally had his hair cut or because he was obligated for a separate reason to shave his hair. The question then becomes whether a nazirite can complete his term of naziriteship with his hair shaven.", 
                "It is prohibited for a nazirite to eat anything that is “made of the grapevine” (Numbers 6:4), although the prohibition primarily applies to drinking wine. This is supported by the language of the Torah: “He shall abstain from wine and strong drink” (Numbers 6:3), and: “And after that the nazirite may drink wine” (Numbers 6:20). It is necessary to clarify whether this prohibition applies to all or only parts of the grape and what quantity the nazirite has to ingest of each part or combination of different parts of the grape to violate this prohibition. Another question that arises is with regard to the status of a mixture of grape products and other foods.", 
                "It is prohibited for a nazirite to contract ritual impurity from a corpse. If he does become impure, whether intentionally or unintentionally, the days of his term of naziriteship that he already observed are void and he must begin his term anew. Ritual impurity is imparted not only through touching a corpse, but also from carrying a corpse without direct contact or by standing under the same structure as a corpse. Even parts of an incomplete corpse, such as limbs, bones, blood, and skin, impart ritual impurity. An individual also becomes impure by touching certain items after they have made contact with a corpse. The Gemara clarifies when a nazirite becomes impure in a manner that negates his term of naziriteship and when his term is not negated despite his impurity. Additionally, the Gemara discusses whether there are unique circumstances where even a nazirite is obligated to become ritually impure from a corpse.",

The Gemara also discusses whether this is unique to the prohibition against becoming impure from a corpse, or whether it also applies to one who violates the other prohibitions of naziriteship. There is also a discussion concerning one who becomes impure after his term of naziriteship is completed but before he has brought the requisite offerings, which release him from nazirite restrictions.

This could occur if a husband nullified the nazirite vow of his wife, or a nazirite vow was dissolved by a Sage, or if the nazirite died before completing his term of naziriteship. In these situations, if the nazirite had already designated money or animals for his offerings, many questions arise with regard to the status of these items. The many <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> in these cases are dependent on the manner in which the nazirite set aside his offering, whether he set aside only money or the animals themselves, and if he set aside animals, whether he specified which offering each animal was intended for or if he set them aside without specification. Additionally, the Gemara discusses whether a nazirite may use animals for his offerings after they were designated by another nazirite for his offerings.",

                "To resolve the predicament of a nazirite who might have become impure, the individual in question is required to observe two full naziriteship terms. At the end of the first period he brings the offerings of a nazirite who has become impure, while adding the stipulation that if he was in fact not impure the offerings should be considered those of a pure nazirite or as gift offerings. He then begins a conditional naziriteship term in purity: If he was impure, the new period is obligatory, whereas if he was not impure it is an additional voluntary term. With regard to an uncertainty that involves two nazirites, at the end of the first term they bring offerings of impurity and offerings of purity and stipulate that the offerings for impurity should satisfy the obligation of the individual who was impure, while the other should be for the pure nazirite. At the end of the second term they bring offerings of purity for the one who was impure in the first term, while issuing a corresponding stipulation.", 
                "If a nazirite might have become impure from a corpse and might be a leper, he observes four periods of naziriteship. This is because one act of shaving does not count toward both the obligation of naziriteship and that of a leper. After the first term has been completed, he performs the first shaving of a leper; after the second, he undergoes the second shaving for his leprosy; following the third term he shaves as an impure nazirite; and when the fourth term is over he performs the shaving for the completion of naziriteship in purity.", 
                "Since some of the offerings are sacrificed only due to uncertainty, e.g., those of an impure nazirite and a leper, this individual does not bring a guilt-offering but only a bird sin-offering brought for uncertainty, and other offerings that can be stipulated as voluntary.", 
                "The Gemara analyzed the issue of why one cannot satisfy the obligation of a leper to shave and the shaving of a nazirite with the same act. The Gemara also discussed the tangential issue of the prohibitions against rounding one's head and shaving one's beard. A more in-depth study concerned the relationship between a positive mitzva and a prohibition with regard to the order of preference when two or more mitzvot conflict."

                "In order for a nazirite vow to take effect, one must “clearly utter a vow, the vow of a nazirite, to consecrate himself to the Lord.” This chapter identifies problems that arise with terminology used in making such declarations. The many details in this chapter can be divided into two categories: First, issues related to clarifying the terms one might use to take a nazirite vow; and second, the meaning of different expressions used to describe the duration of the term of naziriteship or to accept multiple terms of naziriteship at once.", 
                "With regard to the first issue, it is clear that one becomes a nazirite if he says: I am hereby a nazirite. The Gemara considers other, less direct ways that one can express his desire to become a nazirite, both by using substitutes for nazirite vows and by using intimations of nazirite vows. The Gemara discusses situations where these less direct expressions are effective, as well as situations where the speaker's statement does not give clear expression to this intent, and he is not a nazirite even if his intention was to take a nazirite vow.", 
                "The second issue concerns setting the duration of the term of naziriteship. It is clear that when one explicitly states the duration or the number of terms of naziriteship that he accepts, he becomes a nazirite for the period that he articulated. The difficulty facing the Gemara is establishing the duration of a term of naziriteship in a situation where he used vague expressions of length or when it is unclear whether he accepted a single term or multiple terms of naziriteship.", 
                "The Sages established that the minimum time frame for a term of naziriteship is thirty days, and one who does not specify the length of his term of naziriteship becomes a nazirite for this amount of time.

                "In this chapter the Gemara established the following: Commonly used substitute terms for the language of nazirite vows and substitute terms that were set by the Sages are effective expressions to use when accepting upon oneself a nazirite vow. Similarly, intimations of nazirite vows that clearly express one's intent to become a nazirite are effective nazirite vows, although they are incomplete statements. Occasionally, the meaning of a statement is understood from its context. For example, if one takes a vaguely articulated vow while a nazirite is passing by or while holding on to one's hair, his statement is considered a nazirite vow. Additionally, one who accepts upon himself some of the restrictions of a nazirite becomes a full-fledged nazirite. However, expressions that are themselves only substitutes for substitute terms of nazirite vows, and ambiguous intimations of nazirite vows that are completely obscure are not considered nazirite vows. They do not obligate the speaker to become a nazirite.", 
                "The Gemara determined that the minimum duration of a term of naziriteship is thirty days. If one takes a nazirite vow without specifying the duration of the naziriteship, he becomes a nazirite for thirty days. This is true even if he says that he will be a nazirite for one large period, or for one small period, without specifying the precise length of the period. If he accepts upon himself a period of a naziriteship and a half, he is obligated to observe two thirty-day periods, unless it was clear that he intended to accept upon himself one term of naziriteship that would last longer than the duration of an unspecified term of naziriteship. If one compares the number of naziriteship periods that he is accepting upon himself with separate, distinct items, he becomes obligated in multiple, consecutive terms, equal to the number of items with which he compared his naziriteship.", 
                "This chapter discussed the three different ways that one can become a nazirite for the duration of his lifetime and the different <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> that apply to each type of lifelong nazirite. One who accepts upon himself consecutive terms of naziriteship or a single term of naziriteship that will last longer than his life span is a nazirite forever. In the case of consecutive terms, the nazirite treats each period as a separate term of naziriteship. He shaves his hair and brings offerings at the conclusion of each term. One who takes a nazirite vow and specifies that it applies for the duration of his life is also a nazirite forever. In this case, the individual is known as a permanent nazirite and is obligated in one long term of naziriteship that lasts for the duration of his lifetime. However, once a year he trims his hair and brings the nazirite offerings. Finally, some Sages explain that it is possible to vow to be a nazirite like Samson. This type of naziriteship lasts for the duration of one's life but differs from a permanent nazirite in that the individual is permitted to become impure from a corpse but is prohibited from ever cutting his hair."

All the days of his naziriteship he shall eat nothing that is made of the vine, from pits to grape skin. All the days of his vow of naziriteship no razor shall come upon his head; until the days are fulfilled, in which he consecrated himself to the Lord, he shall be sacred, he shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long. All the days that he consecrated himself to the Lord he shall not come near to a dead body. For his father or his mother, for his brother or for his sister, he shall not become impure for them when they die; because his naziriteship to God is upon his head. All the days of his naziriteship he is sacred to the Lord. And if any man dies very suddenly beside him, and he renders impure his consecrated head, then he shall shave his head on the day of his purification, on the seventh day he shall shave it. And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the Tent of Meeting. And the priest shall prepare one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, and make atonement for him, for that he sinned by reason of the dead; and he shall hallow his head that same day. And he shall consecrate to the Lord the days of his naziriteship, and shall bring a male sheep of the first year for a guilt-offering; but the former days shall be void, because his consecration was rendered impure.",

And the priest shall bring them before the Lord, and shall sacrifice his sin-offering and his burnt-offering. And he shall sacrifice the ram for a sacrifice of a peace-offering to the Lord, with the basket of unleavened bread; the priest shall also sacrifice its meal-offering, and its libation. And the nazirite shall shave his consecrated head at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, and he shall take the hair of his consecrated head and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace-offering. And the priest shall take the cooked foreleg, and one unleavened loaf out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them upon the palms of the nazirite after he has shaven his naziriteship. And the priest shall wave them for a wave-offering before the Lord; this is sacred for the priest, together with the breast of waving and the thigh of heaving; and after that the nazirite may drink wine. This is the law of the nazirite who takes a vow, and of his offering to the Lord for his naziriteship, beside that for which his means suffice; according to his vow which he takes, so he must do after the law of his naziriteship.

A priest prepares his sin-offering and burnt-offering inside the Temple courtyard, followed by the ram as a peace-offering, along with the basket of unleavened bread. The priest also sacrifices the meal-offering and libation. Meanwhile, the nazirite shaves off the hair of his head at the entrance to the Israelite Courtyard. He then takes this hair and places it on the fire that is under the pot that contains the peace-offering. After the nazirite has shaved, the priest takes the cooked foreleg of the ram along with one unleavened loaf and one unleavened wafer, and places them on the nazirite's open palms, and waves them. These portions belong to the priest, along with the animal's breast and thigh. Afterward, the nazirite may drink wine.",

This chapter describes which items are included in this prohibition and the quantity a nazirite must consume to be liable to receive lashes. Second, a nazirite may not shave his hair. The Gemara analyzes the definition of shaving and whether the prohibition is violated only by the use of certain implements. The Gemara also considers the amount of hair that must be cut before one is liable to receive lashes, as well as the amount of hair that must be removed for the obligatory shaving at the end of the term of naziriteship. Finally, a nazirite may not become impure by contact with a corpse. This topic is addressed in general terms here, as its particulars are examined in Chapter Seven.",

These are known as the shaving of impurity. The Torah lists the offerings a pure and an impure nazirite must bring, and this chapter discusses various details relevant to these rites.

This is the case whether the mistake occurred as a result of the language one used to express his purpose, or if the vow was based on a mistaken assumption. A vow might also not take effect if the verbalized statement did not match the speaker's intention.",

Likewise, if one designated an offering for a naziriteship, and the vow of naziriteship was then dissolved, his act of consecration is rendered void. Finally, a vow of naziriteship is ineffective if it was undertaken with the belief that the individual possessed animals he could sacrifice, but later discovered that he had no such animals.",

The uncertainty of the situation might stem from the individual's being unable to ascertain the truth of the matter, or in a case where the truth cannot be objectively determined.",

Therefore, a consecration of an item to the Temple treasury is legally equivalent to transferring ownership of that item to another person. For this reason it can be argued that even if uttered in error, an act of consecration is binding. The same would be the case with regard to a vow of naziriteship or a vow of prohibition, as the phrase “to the Lord” is used in the Torah with regard to both of these. An error may occur if the individual was mistaken about the circumstances, or if he supposed that events in the future would unfold differently. Similarly, one might link his declaration to facts that cannot be verified.",

The resolution of this dilemma has important ramifications: The dissolution of vows is based on the ability of a halakhic authority to detect a discrepancy between one's thoughts and his statements. Can a halakhic authority dissolve a vow of consecration by identifying extenuating circumstances or regret on the part of the individual who took the vow?",

However, their masters can prevent them from observing this vow in practice, in which case the Canaanite slave must wait until he is emancipated before he can fulfill it.

The exact language used by the second speaker determines his obligation in the event that the initial vow is nullified by a woman's father or husband, or uprooted altogether by an act of dissolution performed by a halakhic authority.

In the first situation an individual declares which animals should be the sin-offering, burnt-offering, guilt-offering, and peace-offering, or which sum of money should pay for each offering. In the second scenario the nazirite merely sets aside animals or the equivalent sums without specifying how they are to be used. The Gemara considers what happens in these cases if the naziriteship vow is canceled, e.g., it is nullified by a woman's husband, or the individual dies. The basic <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> is that each animal is treated differently when its use was determined beforehand, but other principles govern situations where no specifications were made. These rulings also apply when a nazirite wishes to use the animals his nazirite father set aside before dying. Despite the fact that in general one cannot achieve atonement with an animal designated for another person, a unique <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> permits this in the case of a nazirite who inherits animals from his father.", 
                "Another <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> of naziriteship concerns the power of a father to declare his son a nazirite. This option exists until the son reaches the age of maturity, and it is available only for a father and with the son's acquiescence. The vow does not take effect if the son rejects the naziriteship, either on his own accord or at the behest of his relatives. Animals set aside as offerings for a son's naziriteship are sacrificed if he completes the term, or are treated like the offerings of a nazirite who dies if the vow is not observed.",

If a wife violates her naziriteship, unaware that her husband has in fact nullified it, she incurs lashes for rebelliousness by rabbinic law. This <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> shows that one's intentions are significant beyond the strict observance of the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>. God holds an individual accountable if he attempts to sin, even if his attempt at transgression actually fails.

On the other hand, if he did not become impure he ought to continue his term without interruption. A second difficulty concerns the nazirite's obligation to bring offerings. Not only do an impure nazirite and a pure nazirite at the completion of their terms bring different sets of offerings, but the possibility that a nazirite may not have any obligation to bring these offerings raises a whole series of problems. These include the order in which the animals are brought, the manner in which they are sacrificed, and the consumption of offerings brought in uncertainty. ",

The first concerns an uncertainty in which one of two nazirites became impure from a corpse and it is unclear which of them it was. The other case is that of a nazirite who might have been rendered impure from a corpse and who also might be a leper. This second case is especially complicated, as the purification of a leper includes the obligation to shave twice. In addition to the fact that the requirement of a nazirite and a leper to shave do not apply at the same time, there is a conflict between the leper's requirement to shave and the nazirite's prohibition against doing so. An additional question is whether one act of shaving can fulfill the obligation of both conditions. The analyses of these problems comprise the central material of this chapter."

One is liable to be punished for violating the prohibition of eating a grape product if he eats an olive-bulk, while the minimum amount for incurring liability for drinking wine or wine vinegar is a quarter-<span class=\"it-text\">log</span>. Although the ingestion of all grape products is technically a single prohibition, the Torah imposes separate punishments of lashes for the consumption of different items.",

A nazirite is also liable to receive lashes if another person removes a hair from his head, if this was done with his consent. This is the case whether the hair was cut with an instrument or removed manually. Nevertheless, the naziriteship term is negated and considered interrupted only if most of the nazirite's head was shaved with a razor or a similar implement. At the end of his naziriteship term, the individual is obligated to shave his entire head, and the performance of this mitzva is invalid if he leaves even two hairs on his head. This shaving of purity must be performed with a razor, like the shaving of a leper.", 
                "The three prohibitions of naziriteship, namely the consumption of products of the grapevine, shaving, and contracting ritual impurity imparted by a corpse, differ with regard to those occasions when they are suspended. For example, a nazirite who becomes a leper must shave for his ritual purification from his leprosy, and he is permitted to contract impurity to tend to a corpse with no one to bury it [<span class=\"it-text\">met mitzva</span>]. By contrast, a nazirite may never drink wine. There are other differences between the three prohibitions: If a nazirite becomes impure, his entire term of naziriteship is negated, and he must bring offerings for his impure naziriteship before starting naziriteship afresh. Conversely, if a nazirite shaves, his term of naziriteship is not negated. However, he must wait thirty days for his hair to grow again, even if he was shaved against his will. Finally, if a nazirite drinks wine, his term continues uninterrupted, although he is liable to receive lashes. This is the case even if he did so intentionally.", 
                "Once a nazirite's term has been completed, he brings the offerings of a pure nazirite.

In this case he must still bring the other required offerings.",

Additionally, the chapter considered various issues associated with a priest contracting ritual impurity from a corpse, e.g., when exactly he may come into contact with a corpse of a close relative.

The underlying theme of these disparate discussions is the naziriteship of women, as the analysis of women's naziriteship sheds light on the institution as a whole. There are two unique factors involved in the case of a woman who vows to become a nazirite. First, this vow shares a feature common to all vows of a woman, which is the right of her father or husband to nullify the vow. This nullification has further ramifications if another person linked his naziriteship vow to that of this woman before her father or husband nullified it. Additionally, it must be established what is to be done in the case of a woman who intentionally violates a vow that has been nullified without her knowledge, and what becomes of the animals that have been set aside as offerings for this vow. Finally, at what point during the term of naziriteship is the option to nullify a woman's vow no longer available to her father or husband?",

Furthermore, under certain circumstances, a son may make use of the animals his father set aside for his naziriteship offerings if the father dies and he and the son were both nazirites. The Sages determined that these <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> apply to sons but not to daughters, and to fathers rather than mothers.",

                "It has been determined that, in preparation for war, a singular priest is appointed to address the nation. This priest, who in several respects resembles the High Priest, is termed the priest anointed for war. While the nation is still within the borders of Eretz Yisrael, the priest anointed for war announces to the assembled that men in any of three circumstances are released from combat: “What man is there that has built a new house, and has not dedicated it? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it. And what man is there that has planted a vineyard, and has not used the fruit thereof? Let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle and another man use the fruit thereof. And what man is there that has betrothed a wife, and has not taken her? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her” (Deuteronomy 20:5–7). The officers repeat his words more audibly, and then they add the statement: “What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted?” (Deuteronomy 20:8), also sending home any man who is afraid in the face of battle.", 
                "When the ranks come to the battle front and are preparing to engage the enemy, the priest again addresses the people. First, he recites the verses: “Hear Israel, you draw near today to battle against your enemies; let not your heart faint; fear not, nor be alarmed, and do not be terrified of them; for the Lord your God is He that goes with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you” (Deuteronomy 20:3–4). Thereafter, the priest and the officers repeat the announcements from the first assembly.", 
                "With respect to the terms mentioned in the verses, a vineyard is defined as any group of five fruit-bearing trees, whether they have been newly planted, layered, or grafted. A house is defined as any permanent structure that is fit for a domicile. Finally, a new wife is defined as either one whom the man has betrothed or his recently widowed <span class=\"it-text\">yevama</span>, who is waiting for him to perform levirate marriage. In addition, the vineyard and the home need not be truly new but merely new to him, e.g., purchased or inherited. Furthermore, this <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> applies only if the assets in question are lawfully acquired or produced; if they are forbidden to him in some way he does not return home. With respect to the term “fearful and fainthearted,” it has been resolved that the phrase should be understood literally, indicating one who is terrified or is emotionally unfit to participate in the war.", 
                "All of those who are exempt from the battle for any of the aforementioned reasons must nevertheless support the troops logistically, through repairing roads and providing food. By contrast, one who in the past year has built a new house and has already dedicated it, has planted a new vineyard and has begun to enjoy its fruits, or who has married a new wife, is exempt from assisting the army altogether. Such a person is likewise exempt from all other communal work.", 
                "It has also been resolved that all these exemptions apply only to an elective war, which is a war the nation undertakes voluntarily in order to broaden its borders. However, when the Jewish people are fighting an obligatory war mandated by a mitzva for the sake of conquering Eretz Yisrael, fighting against Amalek, or fighting in self-defense against attackers, everyone is required to go to battle. In those circumstances as well, the priest anointed for war recites words of encouragement and inspiration before the battle."

There is a dispute as to whether the warning need be issued in the presence of witnesses, as well as a dispute as to whether the woman's seclusion needs to be known through the testimony of two witnesses. The halakhic conclusion is that the warning must be issued in the presence of two witnesses and the seclusion must be known through the testimony of two witnesses. Once these conditions are met, the wife and husband may not engage in sexual intercourse until and unless it has been proven through the <span class=\"it-text\">sota</span> evaluation (see Numbers, chapter 5) that she is innocent of any wrongdoing. However, it is sufficient for one witness to testify to the woman's actual defilement in order to render her forbidden to her husband and deny her the possibility of proving her innocence through the drinking of the bitter<span class=\"it-text\"> </span>water.",

In order for the woman to assume the status of a <span class=\"it-text\">sota</span>, her seclusion with the man must be for a specific duration, as recorded in the Gemara.",

If the court decides in the affirmative, it appoints two Torah scholars to escort the couple to the Temple. After arriving at the Temple the woman is taken to the Sanhedrin, where its members attempt to persuade her not to drink the water if she is guilty.

And it shall be, that the city that is nearest to the slain man, the Elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd, that has not been worked with and that has not pulled a yoke. And the Elders of that city shall bring down the heifer into a hard valley, which may be neither worked nor sown, and shall break the heifer's neck there in the valley.

And all the Elders of that city, who are nearest unto the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley. And they shall speak and say: Our hands did not spill this blood, nor did our eyes see. Forgive, Lord, Your people Israel, whom You have redeemed, and suffer not innocent blood to remain in the midst of Your people Israel. And the blood shall be forgiven them. So shall you put away the innocent blood from the midst of you, when you shall do that which is right in the eyes of the Lord. (Deuteronomy 21:1–9)",

The chapter discusses the identity of the Elders who come to take the measurement. Who is defined as a slain victim for the purposes of this mitzva: Is it any murder victim, or could the definition be more limited? The Gemara also discusses other details of this ritual: From where the measurements are taken, and what type of city can be classified as the city closest to the victim. Furthermore, the Gemara examines the requirements in terms of the animal to be used: What is a heifer? What “work” disqualifies it? What does the Torah mean by “a hard valley”? How is the animal killed, and what <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> apply to the place where it is killed?",

                "The other main topic addressed in this chapter is the list of things that became null over the generations, due to either a deterioration in the performance of mitzvot, tragedies that happened to the Jewish people, or the death of specific Sages. Some of these changes had halakhic implications, both in the cessation of certain mitzvot and in the enactment of new decrees, while others were spiritual losses not linked to any specific mitzva."

The ritual is only performed when there is no testimony as to the identity of the murderer. Any testimony, even that of a person ordinarily disqualified from testifying, obviates the need for the performance of the ritual.

And it shall be, when you draw near to battle, that the priest shall approach and speak to the people. And he shall say to them: Hear Israel, you draw near today to battle against your enemies; let not your heart faint; fear not, nor be alarmed, and do not be terrified of them; for the Lord your God is He that goes with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you. And the officers shall speak to the people, saying: What man is there that has built a new house, and has not dedicated it? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it. And what man is there that has planted a vineyard, and has not used the fruit thereof? Let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle and another man use the fruit thereof. And what man is there that has betrothed a wife, and has not taken her? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her. And the officers shall speak further to the people, and they shall say: What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted? Let him go and return unto his house, lest his brethren's heart melt as his heart. (Deuteronomy 20:1–8)", 
                "When a man takes a new wife, he shall not go out with the army, neither shall he be charged with any business; he shall be free for his house one year, and shall cheer his wife whom he has taken. (Deuteronomy 24:5)",

The addresses of the priest and the officers are stated explicitly in the Torah; however, the details still require clarification.",

                "In addition, the chapter will clarify and define a number of terms and circumstances mentioned in the verses, among them: What is included in the word vineyard, what is considered a house, and which wife is considered a new wife. Similarly, the Gemara explores the definition of the “fearful and fainthearted.” The Torah relates directly to those who are about to dedicate their homes, or enjoy their vineyards, or marry the women whom they have betrothed. In parallel, this chapter explores the status of those who have dedicated a home, begun to benefit from a vineyard, or married over the past year.",

                "This chapter discussed the different types of testimony that are required in order to question a woman's fidelity and establish her status as a <span class=\"it-text\">sota</span>. In order to establish a woman as a <span class=\"it-text\">sota </span>of uncertain fidelity there is a requirement that either the warning, the act of seclusion, or both be corroborated through the testimony of two valid witnesses, as discussed in the first chapter of the tractate. Nevertheless, after it is determined that the woman is a <span class=\"it-text\">sota</span>,<span class=\"it-text\"> </span>even lesser forms of corroboration are sufficient to impact the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot </span>of the woman.", 
                "In order to put the woman to death two witnesses are necessary. To disqualify the woman from drinking the bitter water of a <span class=\"it-text\">sota</span>, however, one witness is sufficient. Even one generally disqualified from bearing witness can testify in this regard, and even the testimony of the five women normally suspected of hating this woman is accepted. Additionally, even an unsubstantiated public rumor that has become the widespread gossip of the city, e.g., after being discussed by the women who spin thread by the light of the moon, is sufficient to prohibit the woman from drinking the bitter water.", 
                "Although all these lesser forms of corroboration are sufficient to prevent the woman from drinking the bitter water, there are differences between them as to the degree of their acceptability. For instance, if the corroboration was based only on a public rumor or the testimony of one of the women who is known to hate the <span class=\"it-text\">sota</span>, then the <span class=\"it-text\">sota </span>will still receive payment of her marriage contract. However, if the corroboration is based on the testimony of a single witness, even if it is someone who is generally disqualified from testifying such as a woman or a slave, then the testimony is sufficient to cause the woman to lose her rights to the marriage contract.", 
                "These <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot </span>apply in situations where there is no testimony available to contradict the testimony concerning the woman's guilt. However, if others testify that the woman did not commit adultery, it is not always considered valid. In the event that one valid witness testified to her infidelity and his testimony was accepted initially, but it was later contradicted by another, then so long as only one individual contradicts the initial witness the woman remains disqualified from drinking. However, if there are two witnesses contradicting the testimony concerning her guilt then the individual witness's testimony is not accepted. If, however, all the witnesses testify at the same time, then the witness to her guilt is not accepted and the woman can drink the bitter water. If, however, all the witnesses are those who are usually disqualified from giving testimony, then the majority of witnesses are followed, either concerning guilt in order to prevent her from drinking, or concerning her innocence in order to allow her to drink."

            "Introduction to Sotah": [
                "Tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Sota</span> deals primarily with the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> associated with a <span class=\"it-text\">sota</span>, a woman whose husband suspects that she is unfaithful, and warns her not to seclude herself with a specific man. In the event that she secludes herself with that man, she is considered a <span class=\"it-text\">sota</span>, and it is prohibited for her to remain married to her husband unless she is taken to the Temple and undergoes an evaluation rite in order to determine whether she was in fact unfaithful. This rite includes the offering of a special meal-offering, the taking of an oath, and the drinking of the bitter water of a <span class=\"it-text\">sota</span>. However, the tractate also discusses the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of those who go out to battle, the blessing given by the priests, and other topics.", 
                "The process by which a woman is given the status of a <span class=\"it-text\">sota</span> and the subsequent evaluation of her fidelity comprises two separate stages: First, seclusion with another man, the means by which a woman becomes a <span class=\"it-text\">sota</span>. Second, the evaluation rite by which it is determined miraculously whether the woman is guilty of infidelity. Although the evaluation rite might bring about the death of a guilty woman, nevertheless, the purpose of such a procedure is to return peace and harmony to the marriage (see <span class=\"it-text\">Shabbat</span> 116a). This rite is not practiced in every instance when the husband suspects his wife of infidelity. Rather, it is performed when the level of suspicion is sufficient to suggest that the woman was unfaithful. The <span class=\"it-text\">sota</span> process involves a warning, which is likely the result of suspected promiscuous behavior on the part of the wife. If the woman is subsequently seen by two witnesses secluding herself for a sufficient amount of time to engage in sexual intercourse with the man about whom she was warned, then she must undergo the evaluation rite. Even if she didn't actually commit adultery, the woman's behavior is referred to by the Torah as an act of betrayal, both to her husband and to God, Who commanded the couple with regard to the sanctity of marriage (<span class=\"it-text\">Midrash Tanhuma</span>, Numbers 5).", 
                "Under these circumstances, the husband is permitted to divorce his wife due to her immodest behavior, and therefore, if he opts to evaluate whether she is permitted to him by means of the <span class=\"it-text\">sota</span> rite, it is indicative of the fact that he is interested in removing his doubts about her fidelity and rebuilding the relationship. Additionally, the wife has the prerogative to refuse to undergo the rite, and to be divorced without any payment of her marriage contract. If she opts to undergo the demeaning rite to prove her innocence, it is indicative of her remorse for her suspicious behavior and of her desire to put an end to their marital distrust and strife. In such a situation, where logic would call for dissolution of the marriage, the Torah provides a miraculous means of evaluating the woman's fidelity, which is ordinarily not verifiable by means of witnesses. The purpose of this rite is to bring peace to a marriage where the woman is, in fact, innocent, and the various elements of the rite would seem not only to evaluate whether she was faithful but also to contribute to rebuilding the necessary trust of the husband in his wife if she did not engage in adulterous sexual intercourse.", 
                "In a number of places (see 8b, 9a, 14a) the Gemara explains that the actions of the <span class=\"it-text\">sota</span> are like the actions of an animal. This description of her actions is clearly true if she actually engaged in adulterous sexual intercourse, a transgression punished by capital punishment or excision, but the description of her actions as animal-like is accurate even if she merely secluded herself with the man after the warning. Since she has degraded herself by engaging in such behavior, the evaluation rite in the Temple calls for certain acts that serve to degrade the woman and remind her of her behavior: The priest publicly tears her upper garment and then ties it up with a thick rope; he removes her hair covering and unbraids her hair; the woman drinks the bitter water from a plain, earthenware vessel; and the meal-offering of the <span class=\"it-text\">sota</span> is brought from barley, which is animal food, unlike virtually all other meal-offerings, which are brought from wheat, a human staple. Additionally, no oil or frankincense is added to the meal-offering, to ensure that it is very plain.", 
                "One of the unique elements of the <span class=\"it-text\">sota</span> evaluation rite is that it is the only mitzva in the Torah whose entire essence is rooted in a miraculous process. The evaluation of the woman through the drinking of the bitter water is not a natural act, as the ingredients alone are not responsible for the death of an adulterous woman. Rather, it is a supernatural test, which results in guilty women meeting a unique death, while women who were not adulterous receive an extra blessing concerning their childbearing abilities. Additionally, the woman's drinking of the water evaluates not only her fidelity; if she is guilty, her paramour, wherever he may be, will die the same terrible death.", 
                "Another unique aspect of this mitzva is that the preparation of the bitter water involves the erasing of God's name, an act that is prohibited under all other circumstances due to a negative mitzva. Because of these exceptional aspects of the mitzva of the <span class=\"it-text\">sota </span>rite, both the miraculous nature of the evaluation as well as the need to erase God's name, the court would try to discourage a woman from drinking the bitter water unless she was entirely convinced of her innocence. They would try to dissuade her through either explanation, invoking fear, or attempting to weaken her resolve if she was in fact guilty.", 
                "In order for the evaluation rite to be effective, the husband himself had to be free of any iniquity, which is understood to mean either that he never committed any act of illicit sexual activity in his adult life, or that he did not have relations with his wife after her seclusion with the paramour. The Gemara also discusses a dispute initially recorded in the mishna as to whether a woman's punishment can be delayed due to her observing the mitzvot, learning Torah, or enabling her husband's or children's Torah study.", 
                "Due to the miraculous nature of the evaluation rite and the fact that not every generation is worthy of having such open miracles performed in its midst, the Sages no longer allowed the rite to be performed from the time of the generation prior to the destruction of the Second Temple.", 
                "Although the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> involving a <span class=\"it-text\">sota</span> comprise an independent unit of <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span>, they also overlap with a number of more general aspects of <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> involving marriage. A woman who was warned by her husband and secluded herself with the suspected man essentially puts into question her fidelity to her husband, and her halakhic status with regard to certain marital issues is altered. Until she is able to prove her innocence through the evaluation rite, it is prohibited for her to engage in sexual intercourse with her husband. And even in the event of divorce from her husband, it is forbidden for her to marry her paramour. Additionally, if she is married to a priest it is prohibited for her to partake of <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span>. Furthermore, due to the strong basis of suspicion that her seclusion has raised, she almost always loses the right to payment of her marriage contract, unless she proves her innocence. Finally, even one witness testifying to her engaging in sexual intercourse with her paramour suffices to render it prohibited for her to attempt to prove her innocence through the <span class=\"it-text\">sota</span> rite.", 
                "In connection with the discussions of the <span class=\"it-text\">sota</span> process and the evaluation rite, a number of other issues are discussed in the tractate. Some of these issues are discussed at length, particularly matters that aren't directly related to any particular tractate in the Talmud. For example, ceremonial mitzvot that involve a lengthy process and are also associated with the Temple and performed by priests are discussed here. Also discussed are the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> involved in going out to battle, which involve a speech by the priest appointed to prepare the soldiers for battle. The blessings and the curses that were said by the people upon their arrival to Eretz Yisrael in the days of Joshua; the mitzva<span class=\"it-text\"> </span>of assembly, consisting of a public reading of the Torah in the Temple area; as well as the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of the heifer whose neck is broken at the scene of an unsolved murder are all discussed at great length.", 
                "Tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Sota</span> also contains a large amount of aggadic material, much of it stemming from the unique nature of the punishments discussed in the tractate. The miraculous nature of the evaluation rite, and its purpose in identifying whether or not adultery occurred, is also the source for a larger discussion about the nature of sin in general, and the nature of particular transgressions of famous biblical figures. This also leads to discussion with regard to divine retribution in general, and the aspects of measure for measure, which are used to define the means of God's system of reward and punishment.", 
                "The statement at the end of the tractate discussing the need to discontinue the use of the evaluation rite when the nation was no longer worthy of such a miraculous occurrence in their midst leads to the discussion of other, similar procedures that were discontinued for the same reason. This opens the text for a discussion of the unfortunate downfall of the Jewish people from their glorious spiritual levels to the depths of disgrace, which camouflaged the inner, spiritual beauty of the nation.",

This list of major services included: The removal of the ash from the altar, the slaughter of the daily offering, the conveyance of its pieces to the ramp leading up to the altar, the burning of incense, and the conveyance of the sacrificial limbs from the ramp to the altar itself. The lotteries were performed as follows: All priests who were eligible to perform the service at hand stood in a circle. The appointee in charge instructed one of the priests to remove his mitre. A number much larger than the number of gathered priests was chosen at random. Each priest extended his finger, and the appointee, beginning with the bareheaded priest, counted all the fingers, going around the circle, several times if necessary, until the selected number was reached.

However, unlike a private offering, the pieces were conveyed to the altar ceremoniously by several priests, each one carrying one or more of the parts. Moreover, two teams of priests participated in this process: One who carried the limbs to the base of the ramp leading up to the altar, and another team which brought the limbs up to the altar itself. In the meantime, as this procedure was going on, other morning services, involving the candelabrum and the inner altar, were performed. ",

                "This chapter discussed the Sages' tradition that the mitzva to afflict oneself on Yom Kippur is expressed by refraining from five major types of physical benefit: Eating and drinking, washing, anointing with oil, wearing shoes, and engaging in conjugal relations. The most stringent of these is the prohibition against eating and drinking, which incurs the punishment of <span class=\"it-text\">karet</span>. Food itself is not forbidden on Yom Kippur; rather, it is prohibited to refrain from afflicting oneself. Consequently, the measure that determines liability is a date-bulk of food or a cheekful of drink, amounts which lessen the affliction to a certain degree.", 
                "Notwithstanding the stringency of the prohibition and the holiness of the day, the principle that all mitzvot of the Torah are overridden in cases of illness or danger is applied even on Yom Kippur. The Torah was given “to live by” (Leviticus 18:5). Therefore, on Yom Kippur the mitzva of affliction, along with almost all the mitzvot, is superseded by any risk to life or health. The only exceptions to this principle are the three cardinal sins of idolatry, forbidden relations, and murder.", 
                "The concern for saving life is so great that if there is any risk at all, whether in the opinion of the doctors or in the opinion of the sick person himself, the fast, the prohibitions involving affliction, and the sanctity of the day are overridden.", 
                "The obligation to afflict oneself, like all mitzvot of the Torah, applies only to adults. The Torah considers children who have reached puberty, i.e., boys from the age of thirteen and girls from the age of twelve, to be adults in this regard. However, the Sages instructed that parents should begin to educate their children before they become obligated by Torah law. Children should be encouraged to fulfill whichever mitzvot they are able to, either entirely or in part, from the appropriate age.", 
                "The Torah states that on Yom Kippur all sins committed before God are forgiven. This applies only to sins that are purely between man and God. Sins committed against other people, which are really twofold sins since they are also transgressions against God, cannot be atoned for without appeasing the one who has been wronged. Only after receiving forgiveness from the injured party can one hope for forgiveness from Heaven. ", 
                "Divine forgiveness does not exempt one from his obligations, such as bringing a sin-offering, or repaying moneys owed, and the obligations remain even after Yom Kippur. Furthermore, there are certain sins, such as public desecration of God's name, that are so severe that even Yom Kippur does not fully atone for them. These sins remain with a person after Yom Kippur until he has undone the damage caused or until he dies.", 
                "In addition, Yom Kippur atones only for those who abandon their sins and repent. For this reason the Sages established five prayer services on Yom Kippur, with the mitzva of confession in each service, to help one come to true repentance, and to merit through this atonement from sin and forgiveness of transgressions."

The Sages derived the nature of the preparations from the preparations for the dedication of the Tabernacle in the wilderness, when the original priests, Aaron and his sons, were trained for the priesthood. They were commanded to remain in the Tabernacle for all seven days of their inauguration and to perform all the services that they were going to perform in the future. The Sages also learned about the Yom Kippur preparations from other instances of preparing to enter into sanctity. ", 
                "The need to prepare the High Priest for Yom Kippur became more crucial during the Second Temple period. Ideally, the High Priest should be a righteous Torah luminary. However, circumstances during that period led to a situation in which the High Priest did not always meet these expectations. Often the High Priest was not sufficiently expert in the Temple service. At times he was inclined to follow deviant sects that advocated altering the standard ritual procedures. This reality forced the Sages to institute several ordinances designed to familiarize the priest with the service and accustom him to its performance, in order to ensure that he perform the service appropriately, down to the most minute details.",

The Gemara concluded that while the lottery is not to be classified as part of the sacrificial service, it is indispensable in designating the goats, and no other method can achieve that end. However, besides the drawing of the lots themselves, all the other <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of the lottery, such as placing the lots upon the goats, the nature of the lots and the lottery box, and how the lots are to be drawn, are not indispensable. Nevertheless, there is certainly a mitzva to fulfill all those <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> correctly, and the Gemara considered the various details. ",

On the goat sin-offering the strip was tied to the neck, symbolic of the fact that it was to be slaughtered there, and the second strip was tied around the horns of the goat to be sent to Azazel.", 
                "Apropos the discussion concerning the crimson strip of the goats, the Gemara turned its attention to the crimson strip used in the rite of the red heifer and then proceeded to analyze many of the other details pertaining to the rite. The Gemara expounded many of the verses in the Torah passage of the red heifer and specifically considered a number of <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> that are common to both the red heifer and the goats on Yom Kippur.", 
                "The next stage in the day's service was the confession of the High Priest upon the bull. After the confession, the High Priest slaughtered the bull and collected its blood. However, the blood was not used immediately. The High Priest first went to collect the coals for the burning of the incense in the Holy of Holies, and the blood of the bull was sprinkled only later. Therefore, in the meantime, the blood was given to a priest to hold and stir to ensure that it did not congeal. ", 
                "The burning of the incense in the Holy of Holies was the high point of the Yom Kippur service. As such, there were many unique parts of the service and preparations for it that were performed only on Yom Kippur. For example, the coals were scooped in a way that was different from the normal manner, a special arrangement of wood was made to provide the coals with which to burn the incense, and the incense was ground much more finely that it normally was. The Gemara considered these and many other distinctions between how the service was performed on Yom Kippur and how it was performed during the rest of the year, with regard to both the incense and the other rites of the day.

Any change in the order or number of sprinklings disqualifies the service. ",

The sprinklings outside, on the curtain and the golden altar in the Sanctuary, are also performed with the blood of certain other special sin-offerings, i.e., the bull brought by the anointed priest and the bull brought for an unwitting communal sin. The Gemara clarifies some of the differences between these rites. ", 
                "There are several differences of opinion with regard to the manner of the sprinkling on the golden altar, and the discussion in the Gemara indicates that there were various customs with regard to its performance even during the period of the Temple itself. ", 
                "Everyone agrees that not only are certain rites of the Yom Kippur service indispensable for atonement, but so is the order of their performance. Consequently, if the High Priest performed a later service first, he must go back and start over from the beginning. However, this requirement is limited to the special rites of the day, those performed by the High Priest in his white garments inside the Holy of Holies. ",

And he shall take from the blood of the bull, and he shall sprinkle it with his finger upon the Ark cover to the east, and before the Ark cover he shall sprinkle seven times from the blood with his finger. And he shall slaughter the goat of the sin-offering that is for the people, and bring its blood within the veil, and he shall do with its blood as he did with the blood of the bull, and sprinkle it upon the Ark cover and before the Ark cover. And he shall make atonement for the sacred place because of the impurities of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions, even all their sins; and so shall he do for the Tent of Meeting that dwells with them in the midst of their impurity. And there shall be no man in the Tent of Meeting when he goes in to make atonement in the sacred place, until he comes out and has atoned for himself and for his household and for the assembly of Israel.

The High Priest is permitted to enter this chamber only on Yom Kippur, and solely for the purpose of these services.",

The practical performance of this action entails numerous difficulties with regard to the scooping itself, the amount of incense required, and the manner in which it is burned inside the Holy of Holies.

                "Furthermore, the Second Temple differed from both the First Temple and the Tabernacle in the wilderness in that it lacked the Ark of the Covenant and possessed certain structural differences. Therefore, the precise route of the High Priest's entrance into the Holy of Holies and his service inside the inner sanctum require elucidation. Likewise, the commandment that the High Priest be alone in the Sanctuary while performing the service in the Holy of Holies raises various issues, particularly with regard to the exact delineation of the Sanctuary area.",

These rites too are performed almost exclusively on Yom Kippur. The order of the sprinklings on the curtain and the altar must be clarified in detail, from the spot where they are performed to the disposal of the remainder of the blood.", 
                "The Yom Kippur service differs from the regular Temple service in two ways: On the one hand, it is especially important that the Yom Kippur service is performed in the exact order prescribed by the Torah. If the High Priest deviates from this order, the service is invalid. On the other hand, generally speaking, the High Priest does not complete all the rites of one offering from start to finish without interruption; rather, he is constantly moving from one rite to another, and from one offering to another. Consequently, it is easy to fall prey to error in one of the rites, particularly with respect to their order. This chapter addresses those cases where the High Priest made a mistake in this regard, and discusses which errors disqualify the service and which do not. Similarly, if a certain rite was disqualified or interrupted, the Gemara inquires as to at what point in the service the High Priest is obligated to start over. ",

It stands apart from all other days of the year as a time of special sanctity that exceeds the sanctity of all other Festivals. Yom Kippur is the day when reality transcends standard boundaries and conventions, as it is stated in the Torah: “For on this day shall atonement be made for you, to purify you; from all your sins shall you be purified before the Lord” (Leviticus 16:30). It is the Festival celebrating the elimination of all flaws and transgressions and a return to the initial state of purity.", 
                "When Yom Kippur was observed in its fullest sense, it was a day on which the three sublime sanctities, the sanctity of time, the sanctity of place, and the sanctity of man, would converge: The sanctity of time, as this day was established as the day of purification and absolution for transgressions; the sanctity of place, as “once each year” (Leviticus 16:34) the sacred Temple service was performed in the most sacred place, the Holy of Holies, where it is prohibited for any person to enter under any other circumstances; and the sanctity of humanity, as the Temple service is performed on this day exclusively by the High Priest, the most sanctified person in the congregation of Israel.", 
                "The convergence of these three sanctities is the primary activity on Yom Kippur, as it is described in the Bible, the Mishna, and the Talmud. Therefore, most of the matters addressed in tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Yoma</span> pertain to the sacred Temple service, the numerous and complex offerings sacrificed on that day, and the preparation and service of the High Priest. Consequently, most of the subject matter in this tractate belongs in the talmudic order of <span class=\"it-text\">Kodashim</span>, in terms of the problems raised and in terms of its unique methodology. Only a relatively small section of tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Yoma</span> addresses the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of Yom Kippur that relate to the entire Jewish people.", 
                "The <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of offerings comprise a significant portion of the Torah, and likewise <span class=\"it-text\">Kodashim</span>, an entire order of the six orders of the Mishna and Talmud, is devoted to those matters. The significance of the sacrificial service in the Temple is so great that the Sages have said that it is one of the pillars upon which the world stands (<span class=\"it-text\">Avot </span>1:2). Although the offerings ceased with the destruction of the Temple, they are still significant and central in Judaism. The offerings are special mitzvot that facilitate drawing nearer to God. All the types of offerings, despite the many differences between them, manifest the close relationship between man and his Creator.", 
                "The convergence of the person bringing the offering, the priest who sacrifices it, and the altar, which represents the presence of God and His participation in the offering, constitute the connection between man and God, symbolized by their partnership in the offering. There are some offerings, e.g., those that atone for sin, where the person who sacrifices the offering provides only the sacrifice and presents it as an expression of regret and appeasement. With these offerings, the blood of the sacrifice, which symbolizes its soul, “for the blood is the soul” (Deuteronomy 12:23), is sprinkled on the altar and the meat is eaten by the priests. There are other offerings, e.g., peace-offerings, where the person who brings the offering, the priests, and the altar unite in a type of celebratory feast of peace and unity. The sacrificial service is a completely symbolic form of worship, and very few of the symbols are clearly understood. However, each component and ritual in that service is a refined act of intimacy and participation.", 
                "Practically speaking, the structure of the Temple was most complex, to enable it to fulfill its numerous roles. However, its general blueprint was already found in the Tent of Meeting in the wilderness. The two Temples, the First Temple and the Second Temple, were greater than the Tent of Meeting only in terms of their size and complexity. The epicenter of the Temple was the Holy of Holies, in which the Ark of the Covenant was located. On it were the Ark cover and the cherubs, symbolizing God's seat within mundane worldly existence. The Holy of Holies is the inner sanctum, the place where the Divine Presence resides. Outside of it is the Sanctuary, whose structure represents an interior room in a house, with a table on which is arranged the shewbread, the candelabrum for illumination, and the incense altar. Outside the Sanctuary is the Temple courtyard, where the outer altar is located. It serves as an entrance and reception area, and it is there that the Jewish people came to sacrifice their offerings and pray.", 
                "The Yom Kippur service is performed in all of these areas. However, its essence and its primary element is the entrance of the High Priest into the Holy of Holies to burn the incense and sprinkle the sacrificial blood, to atone for and purify the Jewish people once each year. The preparations for the entrance of the High Priest into the inner sanctum, his purification, his special garments, and the offerings he sacrifices on his behalf and on behalf of the congregation of Israel, all these are the components of the Yom Kippur service. The service culminates with the atonement for and purification from all sin, iniquity, and transgression. ", 
                "The two aspects of purification and atonement are intertwined. On the one hand, the High Priest, who is the agent of the Jewish people, ascends to the highest level of sanctity and reaches the inner sanctum. On the other hand, sin and iniquity are removed and cast away from the Jewish people. The ritual that symbolizes these two aspects of atonement reaches its climax in the service of the two Yom Kippur goats. In this service, twin goats are brought to participate in a lottery. One of them expresses the sublime purifying sanctity, and its blood is brought into the Holy of Holies, while the other, which symbolizes all the sins and iniquities of the Jewish people, is sent away outside the Temple, outside the settled area to the wilderness, to Azazel. It is cast from one of the cliffs in the wilderness, symbolizing the casting away of all sins and iniquities to their source, “the waste and howling wilderness” (Deuteronomy 32:10).", 
                "The backdrop to all these rituals in the Temple, the participation of the entire Jewish people, their preparation for this day of purification and atonement, is the Sabbath of solemn rest [<span class=\"it-text\">Shabbat shabbaton</span>], a day of rest from all labor, a day without eating or drinking, a day of abstaining from all the pleasures of this world.

What about ill and weak people whose lives might be endangered by the mitzva of afflicting oneself? Are they obligated to fast under all conditions and situations? Perhaps there are exceptions because of the danger to their lives and well-being. Indeed, this question may be asked about all the mitzvot in the Torah.

Based on a precise reading of the biblical text, the Sages learn that a husband's ability to nullify the vows taken by his wife is limited to vows of particular types: Those that “afflict the soul” (Numbers 30:14), i.e., that cause the woman distress, and those that are “between a man and his wife” (Numbers 30:17), i.e., that negatively impact on the marital relationship. This chapter deals with the precise definitions of these two categories of vows and the halakhic differences between them.

A woman's vows can be nullified only when she is not independent, either because she is in her father's house or she is in her husband's house, and under their respective authority.

The reason for this is that one can prohibit another from benefiting from his own property only by means of a vow, and the Gemara rules that the principle of retroactive clarification makes it possible for each partner to benefit exclusively from his share. In principle, however, even partial ownership of something gives one the power to ban by means of a vow another who is not also a partner from deriving benefit from that property. Accordingly, when one prohibits another from deriving benefit from him, all property belonging to the community of the person who took the vow becomes prohibited to the object of the vow. The only way that person can then benefit from community property is if the person who took the vow transfers his share to a third party. This is the case with regard to property that belongs to a particular community. However, property that belongs to the whole community of Israel is not considered to be held in partnership and one does not have the power to prohibit another from benefiting from it. ",

However, it is generally assumed that a person's intention is for the vow to take effect, and he may not claim later that the vow is invalid simply due to lack of proper intention. Nevertheless, there are exceptional situations where the Sages stated that the intention was clearly not to vow, and therefore, despite being formulated properly, the vow does not take effect. The Sages categorized the situations where a person did not truly intend to vow into four groups: Vows of exhortation, vows of exaggeration, vows that are unintentional, and vows whose fulfillment is impeded by circumstances beyond one's control. The definitions and precise parameters of these four groups constitute one of the primary themes of this chapter. ",

One sometimes formulates a vow using general terminology when he actually intends to refer to a much more specific situation, and the Sages discussed the halakhic parameters of what is included in such a vow. Although this issue is dealt with in more detail in later chapters, this chapter focuses on one group of such cases, where a vow is taken to render benefit forbidden to a group of individuals, e.g., a certain nation or certain profession, but the language of the vow is ambiguous as to precisely who is included and who is not.

The Gemara's ultimate understanding of this joint nullification is that each of these men weakens the force of the entire vow rather than nullifying half of the vow. In this joint nullification process, the power of the father is stronger than the power of the husband, in that if the husband dies the father can nullify vows on his own, which is not the case in the reverse situation. The joint nullification process is used for a betrothed young woman even if she has been betrothed and divorced several times.

Therefore, nullification of a vow can never be performed preemptively, before the vow is taken. Also, one cannot appoint an agent to nullify the vows of one's wife or daughter. The Torah states that a man can nullify a vow only on “the day that he hears it” (Numbers 30:9), i.e., the day on which he first learned of the existence of the vow, but not after that day. For these purposes, a day begins in the evening when the stars first appear and continues until dark on the following night. Consequently, if one hears his daughter's or his wife's vow soon after the night begins, he has the entire day, until the next evening, to nullify it. However, if he hears of it only in the late afternoon, he has only a short time in which to nullify it. Since the period for nullifying vows is limited, one can nullify them even on Shabbat, but in deference to Shabbat one alters the language he uses for nullification.", 
                "One aspect of the relationship between the ratification and the nullification of a vow is that once a vow is ratified, irrespective of the manner of its ratification, it can no longer be nullified. There are several ways for a man to ratify a vow, including making statements that, without saying so explicitly, indicate that he wants the vow to remain in effect. Deciding in his heart to ratify it, even without speaking, is another manner of ratification, as is remaining silent, even if only to annoy his wife, until the time for nullification has past. No matter which manner of ratification is utilized, once the vow is ratified it can no longer be nullified.",

Although the dissolution of vows is prefaced by the phrase “the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel” (Numbers 30:2), indicating dissolution by experts, that is not the only manner in which it can be performed, as dissolution of vows by three laymen is also acceptable. Dissolution of vows also does not have the same strictures as regular court activities and can be performed even by a single expert alone, as well as when those dissolving the vow are standing.

There is also a distinction between a vow not to eat a particular food item and a vow not to eat a type of food.

                "The first category relates to vows of extortion. These are vows taken in an exaggerated manner in order to encourage another to do something specific. It is common knowledge that one did not say his words as a vow but rather as encouragement. ", 
                "Similarly, the second category consists of vows of exaggeration. This refers to a vow aimed at demonstrating that something one said is true, but it is common knowledge that his statement is somewhat exaggerated. ", 
                "The third category, unintentional vows, includes vows taken based on a faulty premise that one later discovers to be incorrect.", 
                "The fourth category, vows impeded by circumstances beyond one's control, do not require dissolution by a halakhic authority, but rather are immediately dissolved. This category can be divided into two groups: The first includes vows taken under the assumption that one will be capable of fulfilling a certain condition. If circumstances beyond his control then arise that prevent him from fulfilling his vow, it is assumed that he did not intend for the vow to take effect in such a situation. The second group includes cases where one is compelled to vow due to financial or other types of distress. In this case, although the vow was verbally expressed in a proper manner, one had no mental intention whatsoever that the vow take effect. Concerning this issue, there is no difference whether a vow or oath was taken, since in both cases one's words do not take effect. ", 
                "In connection with these issues, the Gemara discussed a number of questions related to the dissolution of vows, e.g., what types of openings may be suggested by a halakhic authority to induce the one taking the vow to declare that they never would have intended for it to take effect had they initially considered other factors. Through this process, the vow is transformed into an unintentional vow, which may be dissolved. ", 
                "With regard to the question of understanding the implication of various ambiguous expressions used in a vow, the primary principle is that a vow should be understood based on colloquial language. Therefore, a vow will occasionally be expressed using very general terms, yet colloquially the expression is much more limited in scope. ",

                "However, the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> is different if one states that the vow is in effect today. In these cases the vow expires at the conclusion of the day on which it was made, even though it will have been in effect for less than a full twenty-four-hour period. Nevertheless, the Sages ruled that in such a case, the individual must request that a halakhic authority dissolve his vow at nightfall, due to the possibility that he has confused these slightly different manners of expression. ", 
                "It was also clarified that if one takes a vow for this week, it remains in effect for the Shabbat that occurs at the end of that week. Similarly, when one takes a vow for this seven-year cycle, it remains in effect for the Sabbatical Year that occurs at the conclusion of that cycle. However, when one takes a vow for this month or this year, the vow does not remain in effect for the upcoming New Moon or Rosh HaShana. A vow for this year remains in effect until the end of the year, even if it is declared to be a leap year. ", 
                "When one sets a fixed date for a vow to expire, e.g., a Festival, there is a difference whether he said the vow remains in effect until the Festival, in which case the vow remains in effect until the beginning of the Festival, or whether he said it applies until it will be the Festival, in which case it remains in effect until the end of the Festival. However, if one says that his vow applies until it will be a particular season, rather than a fixed date, it is taken to mean until that season begins. If one takes a vow until an agricultural season, and that season varies from place to place, the vow applies until the beginning of the season in the location where he took the vow. ", 
                "At times, the meaning of the vow is not determined literally but according to context. For example, it is clear that one who vows that wine is forbidden to him until it will be Passover intends for the vow to remain in effect only until the Festival begins, so that he can fulfill the mitzva of drinking the four cups of wine at the Passover Seder. Similarly, if one takes a vow that prohibits a woman from deriving benefit from him because another person is urging him to marry her, his intention is not to prohibit all types of benefit, but only the benefit of marriage.

The one who vows seeks to chastise the other person or to modify his conduct, and consequently prohibits that person from deriving benefit from him. This vow can assume one of two forms: That benefit from his food is forbidden to the other, and that all benefit from him is forbidden to the other. This chapter addresses those vows and raises several questions, particularly with regard to the latter type of vow.", 
                "The first issue is defining the difference between these two vows. Since benefit from one's food is not limited to food alone but includes any monetary gain that could facilitate the purchase of food, when one vows that benefit from his food is forbidden, he prohibits the other from deriving any benefit with monetary value. Therefore, the difference between those two vows must be delineated.", 
                "An additional series of issues stems from an analysis of the relationship between the one who vowed and the one subject to the prohibition in the vow. Typically, relations between people with close familial or collegial ties are precisely those that tend to deteriorate into quarrels that lead to vows. Therefore, situations could arise where one of the parties seeks to assist the other in times of need, but is prevented from doing so by the vow. Therefore, the Gemara first explains those actions that are not considered benefit and that the one who vowed may consequently perform for the one for whom benefit is forbidden. In addition, in circumstances where the one for whom benefit is forbidden is in dire straits and the other seeks to help him, the question is whether there are ways to circumvent the prohibition and assist him despite the vow. The Gemara in this chapter will address these and other related questions. "

When one takes a vow, he may determine that the vow be valid for a certain time period, or that it expire on a specific date. These options give rise to various difficulties. ", 
                "When one takes a vow for a specified period of time, using wording such as: Today, or: This year, or alternatively by using the expressions one day, or one year, the meaning of his words must be clarified more precisely: Does the vow remain in effect until the conclusion of that day or year, or for a full day or year starting from the time when he took the vow?

                "At times, although one may mention an unspecified time, it can be obvious what his exact intention was due to the context in which he took his vow. The question that arises in such cases is: To what extent is the vow to be interpreted in accordance with the intention of the person making the vow even when the details were not mentioned by him explicitly? An additional problem arises within this context: When one mentions a specific time but it is clear from the context that he must not have intended exactly what he said, which takes precedence, the wording of the vow or the actual intent of the person making it?",

Although each category is discussed individually, the Gemara concludes that when a person employs a general term, any item with regard to which an agent would ask the sender whether it is included in the general term, is included in that term with regard to vows. The Gemara also stated that with regard to one who vows that a general category is forbidden to him, all items in that category are rendered forbidden.

This principle applies only in a case where he vowed that a certain item is forbidden to him; however, if he vowed that eating that item is forbidden, its growths are forbidden only when the original item that he sowed or planted remains intact, e.g., a tree. If it does not remain intact, its growths are permitted in that case. On a related note, the Gemara discusses additional halakhic dilemmas in cases where prohibitions take effect on plants, e.g., if and when subsequent growths neutralize the original prohibition.",

However, the Sages treated several of these vows stringently, requiring the one who took the vow to request of a halakhic authority to dissolve it. Similarly, a vow imposed on an action does not take effect by Torah law, as an action does not have actual substance; however, it must be observed by rabbinic law.", 
                "With regard to vows that carry two meanings, one of which is referring to an item forbidden by means of a vow and the other referring to an item forbidden by the Torah, the vow takes effect if it remains unexplained. However, if the one who took the vow explains it in a manner that renders it ineffective, the object of the vow is permitted. If the simple meaning of the vow is such that it should take effect, and the one who took it claims that he meant otherwise, the ruling depends on his status. If he is a Torah scholar, the vow does not take effect. If he is an ignoramus, and he mentions this explanation as extenuating circumstances to allow dissolution of the vow, the vow is treated stringently lest he come to take vows lightly.", 
                "A fundamental difference between vows and oaths is that whereas a vow that is imposed on a matter that does not have actual substance does not take effect, an oath of that type does. This is because an oath is imposed upon a person and can prohibit him from taking an action, whereas a vow imposes a prohibition on an item. One consequence of this distinction is that an oath to nullify a mitzva does not take effect, as one is already under oath from Mount Sinai to fulfill the mitzvot. It is therefore rendered an oath in vain. By contrast, one can impose a prohibition on an item by means of a vow even if it is an item designated for a mitzva. Additionally, one may take several identical vows and they will all take effect. If he transgresses the prohibition he is in violation of each and every vow. An oath, by contrast, does not take effect where an oath was already taken.",

This chapter addresses cases where the individual expressed his vow in a way that is unclear, and it ascertains whether various statements are considered vows. ", 
                "The cases of unclear expressions of vows can be divided into two categories: Substitute terms for vows and intimations of vows. There are certain terms that clearly indicate a vow, e.g., if one says that a particular item shall be considered like an offering [<span class=\"it-text\">korban</span>] or like an item dedicated to the Temple [<span class=\"it-text\">herem</span>], or if one declares himself to be a nazirite [<span class=\"it-text\">nazir</span>].

Some of these words may be so commonly used as substitutes for the terms that express a vow that the two terms may be considered synonymous. Other substitute words express the same idea in another language. In these cases, it is clear that the vow takes effect. Nevertheless, it is necessary to specify which words directly indicate a vow and which do not. ", 
                "An intimation of a vow is when one expresses a vow in an incomplete manner, such that it is possible to understand the individual's intent, although he has not given full expression to it. This category may be further divided between instances where it is clear what the individual had in mind, known as obvious intimations, and instances where the individual's statement may be interpreted in more than one way, i.e., ambiguous intimations.

This occurs primarily through partnerships or from benefit gained through communal or public property, although shared ownership can result from a number of other situations.

If a new situation developed, or if changes occurred to the previous situation, either of which causes the one who took the vow to regret having done so, this cannot be used as an extenuation to dissolve the vow. The reason is that the dissolution of a vow is dependent upon the discovery of a condition, which, had the one taking the vow considered it, would have caused him to reconsider taking the vow in the first place. A situation that arose after the vow was stated could not have been considered at the time the vow was taken, and one does not regret having stated the vow under the circumstances that existed at the time.",

                "A vow that has been partially dissolved, either due to the one who stated the vow expressing regret or because the vow has been deemed a mistaken vow, is entirely dissolved. This is because all prohibitions expressed together are viewed as one vow. This is true if the person stated a broad vow, or if he linked the individual prohibitions together.

If there was some error in the nullification, e.g., a man erred and nullified the vows of his daughter rather than the vows of his wife, or he thought that she took a vow with regard to one thing and it turned out that she had taken a vow with regard to something else, he must nullify the vow a second time. Similarly, if he was mistaken about the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> and did not know that he is authorized to nullify his wife's vows, or he did not know that a certain vow could be nullified, he may nullify the vow when he learns of his mistake. ", 
                "While these are the main issues discussed in the chapter, certain other <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> were discussed as well. It is also explained that a woman may be given a gift even if her husband took a vow that benefit from the donor is forbidden to him, provided that the gift be given in such a way that the husband does not attain possession of it. Incidental to the discussion concerning a woman who takes a vow that renders benefit from her husband forbidden to her, the Gemara brings several cases where the husband is not forced to divorce his wife because of her words, but rather the matter is left to the husband's discretion."

            "Introduction to Nedarim": [
                "Tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Nedarim</span> is similar to tractates <span class=\"it-text\">Nazir</span>,<span class=\"it-text\"> Shevuot</span>, and to a degree, <span class=\"it-text\">Arakhin</span>, in that they all address obligations that are not imposed by the Torah but are voluntarily created by an individual. In a broad sense, the category of vows includes nazirite vows, oaths, and consecrations, which are the primary topics addressed in those tractates. These tractates are connected not only with regard to their general topic but also with regard to the structure of the tractates and the halakhic details that are common to these different manifestations of vows. Tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Nedarim</span>, which addresses the topic of vows in a more narrow sense, is found in the order of <span class=\"it-text\">Nashim</span> because most of the verses in the Torah that address this topic refer to vows of women. However, the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> apply equally to vows made by anyone.", 
                "Most usages of the term vow in the Torah itself refer to vows of consecration, whereby an individual invests an item with sanctity. Conversely, in rabbinic literature, the term vow generally refers to vows of prohibition, whereby one causes a particular item to become forbidden for his use. Nevertheless, vows of prohibition must be understood within the context of vows of consecration. ", 
                "With regard to the impact of a vow upon people, there is a significant difference between vows of consecration and those of prohibition in that vows of consecration render an item forbidden for use by anyone, whereas vows of prohibition cause an item to be forbidden only for the individuals specified in the vow. One can declare any item to be forbidden for use for himself, and one can declare anything he owns to be forbidden for use by anyone else. ", 
                "Although vows are taken voluntarily and one does not fulfill a mitzva by taking a vow, once an individual takes one, he is required by Torah law to keep his word. There is a positive mitzva to keep his vow, expressed in the phrase “he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth” (Numbers 30:3), and one violates a prohibition if he breaks his vow, as expressed in the same verse: “He shall not profane his word.” Due to the fact that once one takes a vow the content of his vow is no longer a personal decision but a formal halakhic requirement, there are specific guidelines as to which declarations cause a vow to take effect. ", 
                "For a vow to take effect, three conditions must be met. First, the individual must intend to take a vow. Next, he must give clear verbal expression to this intent. Finally, there must be an object upon which the vow takes effect, and the vow must be expressed in a way that allows it to apply to that object. If these conditions are not met, the vow does not take effect, at least by Torah law. A large portion of this tractate is dedicated to clarifying each of these conditions and to explaining their relationship to one another.", 
                "The intent of the individual making the vow is of great importance with regard to the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of vows, and if everyone could be trusted to recall their intent, vows would be interpreted on the basis of this intent alone. However, there is a halakhic principle that intentions that are not verbalized have no legal standing. Nevertheless, in cases where the intention of the individual is clear to all, his intent is the determining factor even when his verbal statement indicates something different, e.g., in the cases of vows of urging or of exaggeration, discussed at the beginning of the third chapter. At the same time, intent alone does not create a vow; a vow does not take effect unless it is verbalized. ", 
                "The verbal expression of a vow can lead to questionable situations, e.g., where one did not express his vow clearly and his intention is understood only from context, which is known as an intimation of a vow; where he used substitute terms instead of the terms generally used to express a vow; or when he employed terminology whose precise meaning is unclear. A large portion of tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Nedarim</span> is dedicated to clarifying unclear terminology, including ambiguous expressions or expressions that can be interpreted in either a limited or a broad manner. In particular, this tractate defines various elements that one might refer to in a vow: different types of foods and other products, groups of people, and dates and times. ", 
                "Even when the intent and verbal expression of the individual are clear, there are situations in which a vow cannot take effect. These include cases where one declares an item to be like another item that is inherently forbidden rather than forbidden due to a vow. Additionally, a vow can take effect only if it can apply to an item that has concrete substance. ", 
                "When a vow does take effect, it can apply in a variety of ways. One can cause an item to be forbidden from being eaten, or to become forbidden from having benefit derived from it more generally. The manner in which a vow is expressed indicates whether it is limited to the item specified or whether it applies even to replacement items or to products of the original item. Similarly, it will determine whether the vow applies as long as the item belongs to a particular individual, or whether it continues to apply even if the item later belongs to someone else. Another variable is whether the vow renders a particular item forbidden to the individual making the vow, or whether he is declaring an item that belongs to him to be forbidden to other individuals. ", 
                "While the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of vows are discussed in the Torah, the Sages did not perceive vows to be a positive phenomenon. This is due to a general perspective that it is not advisable to add new prohibitions to those already mentioned in the Torah, and because vows are generally taken when one is angry or embroiled in dispute and often contribute to the perpetuation of the dispute. Consequently, the Sages recommended dissolving vows. ", 
                "The possibility of dissolving a vow is not mentioned explicitly in the Torah, but it stems from the very nature of a vow itself. Since a vow stems from the intent of the individual who makes it, when he is no longer interested in the vow, it should no longer be relevant. Nevertheless, one cannot decide on his own that a vow no longer applies; he must submit a request to an ordained judge or to a rabbinical court to dissolve it. ", 
                "Vows can be dissolved in one of two cases. One case is when there is an opening, i.e., when the judge discovers that the individual did not take into account all of the ramifications of his vow when he originally made it. The other case is due to regret, i.e., the individual regrets ever having made the vow. In these cases the judge can dissolve the vow, abrogating it retroactively. ", 
                "The Torah also introduces the concept of nullification of vows. A father has the authority to nullify the vows of his daughter until she attains majority. Similarly, a husband can nullify the vows of his wife. If this is done, the vows are not abrogated retroactively but are simply canceled from the time of the nullification. The rights of a father or husband to nullify vows are limited with regard to the time frame for nullification, as they can nullify vows only on the day they hear of them. Additionally, a husband can nullify only vows of affliction or those that directly or indirectly affect the relationship between himself and his wife. According to many opinions, a father is also empowered to nullify only vows of affliction or those that affect his relationship with his daughter. In the case of a young betrothed woman, who is still a member of her father's household, the father and husband must both nullify the vow in order for it to be canceled.", 
                "It should be noted that although the Vilna Talmud includes a commentary identified on the page as Rashi, it is generally presumed not to have been written by Rashi himself. This commentary will be referred to in the notes on this tractate as the Commentary on <span class=\"it-text\">Nedarim</span>. Unlike in other tractates, the commentaries of the Ran and the Rosh are printed on the page of the Vilna Talmud in tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Nedarim</span>. They are accorded great significance by those who study this tractate. ", 
                "Tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Nedarim</span> has eleven chapters, some of which address one clearly defined topic, and some of which discuss several topics that are also addressed elsewhere. ", 
                "Chapter One addresses the topics of substitute terms for vows and intimations of vows. ", 
                "Chapter Two discusses vows that do not take effect because one associated the object of his vow with an item that did not itself become forbidden by a vow, or because there is no object of his vow that is subject to vows. It also discusses the differences between vows and oaths. ", 
                "Chapter Three lists vows that do not cause a prohibition because they were not made wholeheartedly. It also defines who is included when one takes a vow that pertains to groups of people. ", 
                "Chapter Four is concerned with the differences between one who vows not to eat an item and one who vows not to derive benefit from an item. It also clarifies what is permitted to one who vows not to derive benefit from another individual. ", 
                "Chapter Five clarifies that if one vows not to derive benefit from another individual, it is prohibited for him to derive benefit even from items that are not owned in their entirety by that individual. ", 
                "Chapter Six defines the terms used to express a vow with regard to various food items. ", 
                "Chapter Seven explains the meanings of various terms used to express a vow, and the prohibition of items that are replacements for or that have grown from items forbidden by a vow. ", 
                "Chapter Eight discusses the periods of time one might specify in a vow. ", 
                "Chapter Nine deals with the dissolution of vows by a judge and the openings necessary to allow their dissolution. ",

                "The first part of the chapter continues the discussion about the requirement that agents who transfer a bill of divorce from outside of Eretz Yisrael must state that it was written and signed in their presence. The following problems are discussed: What if they are unable to testify about the entire bill of divorce but only with regard to part of it? What if one of the witnesses can testify only about the writing and the other only about the signing? Finally, what if only one of the witnesses can testify? Is the agency valid in these cases?", 
                "Another matter analyzed is the definition of the delivery of a bill of divorce: Is this simply a means of transferring the document from one place to another, or is it an act that has halakhic ramifications? If so, the qualifications of the agents must be discussed. Can one who is ordinarily disqualified from testifying, e.g., a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor, deliver a bill of divorce?", 
                "Yet another issue addressed in this chapter is the dating of a bill of divorce. Despite the fact that its essential purpose is to effect a divorce, a bill of divorce may at times be used as evidence in court, both in financial cases and concerning forbidden sexual relations. It is therefore necessary to determine if a bill of divorce without a date or with improper dating is disqualified.",

Does the phrase “he writes her” indicate that the husband must write the bill of divorce by himself? If not, are there any limitations as to who is qualified to compose the document? What is defined as writing in this context: Any formation of letters, or perhaps only the standard manner of writing?

Any bill of divorce that is not written in this manner is not valid, whether it was written without the intention of being used as a bill of divorce or whether it was written for the sake of another woman with an identical name. This requirement is in effect only with regard to bills of divorce but not with regard to other legal documents. The section of the bill of divorce that lists the names of the husband and wife, the date, and the expression: You are hereby permitted to any man, is the essential part of the bill of divorce, and it is this part that must be written for the sake of the woman who is being divorced. Therefore, it should have been permitted for scribes to write the standard part of bills of divorce in advance and to fill in only the essential part specifically for the sake of the woman. However, the Sages decreed that one should not do so.", 
                "Since a bill of divorce that was not written for the sake of the woman cannot be used, there are potential problems in a case where a bill of divorce was lost and then found. If the bill of divorce was lost for a long period of time but then found, and the agent who was sent to transmit it can identify it, either because he recognizes it or by providing distinguishing marks, then he may deliver the bill of divorce to the wife. If there are no distinguishing marks, then an assessment must be made as to whether there is a concern that this bill of divorce is not the original bill of divorce but a different one, written for the sake of another couple. Wherever this concern applies, it is prohibited to transmit the bill of divorce to the wife.", 
                "In general, the presumptive status of the husband is that he is still alive, and therefore an agent may transmit a bill of divorce without being concerned that perhaps the husband died after appointing him. However, if the husband was in a situation of acute danger, e.g., if he was dying, on board a sinking ship, or in a besieged town, or if he was elderly, though not if he had reached an exceptionally old age, then there is a concern that perhaps he died. In connection to this discussion, the Gemara also addresses other <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> that relate to one's presumptive status of being alive, and an item's presumptive status of remaining in its current state. One can separate <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span> and tithes on the basis of money lent to a priest or Levite, as one may presume that they are still alive. Similarly, one may set aside produce and wine for the purpose of separating <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span> and tithes with them; one may then separate the <span class=\"it-text\">teruma </span>and tithes based on the presumption that the produce and wine are still in existence and have not spoiled. In these cases, if there is reason to believe that the produce or wine has been lost or spoiled, one must first check to see that this has not occurred.",

However, if he is obligated to state: The bill of divorce was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence, then he must appoint the new agent in the presence of a court; the second agent is an agent of the court and is not required to state that the bill of divorce was written and signed in his presence. This is true in a case where the agent was not also instructed to perform another action that cannot be transferred, e.g., taking a deposit from the wife. However, if the agent was given a task like this as well, he may not transfer his agency and appoint a second agent."

Once he is restored to sanity, the document may be written and given even without new instructions from the husband.",

However, if two valid witnesses bring the bill of divorce, it is not necessary for them to issue this declaration at all, as they may testify to the validity of the bill of divorce without making use of the rabbinic decree enabling a witness to merely state: It was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence.",

Similarly, if a husband threw a bill of divorce into an area that belongs to his wife, such as her house or courtyard, and he threw it in such a way that it entered the airspace over the partitions that delineate the boundaries of her domain, the divorce is effective; or if he threw it and it landed next to her in a public domain, the divorce is effective.

One possible reason given for the declaration is that it serves as testimony that the bill of divorce was written with the proper intent, in case the residents of the place where it was drafted are not experts in the requirement that a bill of divorce must be written specifically for the sake of the woman in question. Another possibility is that the declaration affirms the authenticity of the document and ratifies the signatures of its witnesses in places where there are no witnesses available to ratify it. One issue that must be clarified for the purposes of this <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> is the definition of the borders of Eretz Yisrael, as well as the question of whether there are other places that have the same status as Eretz Yisrael with regard to the need for the witnesses to state the declaration.",

Furthermore, in both cases the documents effect a change in the personal status of the recipient. Consequently, it is clear that many of the features that differentiate bills of divorce from other documents apply equally to bills of manumission. However, in addition to addressing the slave's change of status, the Gemara inquires as to whether or not emancipation is in his interest.

The Gemara examines the rationale for this and concludes that the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion that the reason for this declaration is that there are no witnesses available to ratify it.", 
                "Although the Gemara states that since the establishment of the great academies in Babylonia that land has the same status as Eretz Yisrael with regard to bills of divorce, the practical <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> is that all agents of a bill of divorce must state the declaration: It was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence. If the agent failed to state the declaration, the bill of divorce can be ratified in the manner of other legal documents, by means of witnesses who can attest to the authenticity of its signatures.", 
                "Most of the special <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of bills of divorce apply equally to bills of manumission. One difference is that a bill of divorce is considered to be to the woman's detriment, whereas a bill of manumission is in the interest of a slave, and therefore it can be acquired for him by others in his absence.", 
                "Due to the concern that the woman might be left as a deserted wife, the Sages were lenient with regard to bills of divorce. In a certain period, one of the witnesses who signed this document could be a Samaritan, although this practice was later prohibited. Conversely, while other legal documents may sometimes be written and signed by gentiles, bills of divorce of this type are invalid. Furthermore, while bills of acquisition and gifts that were written and signed in the owner's lifetime are valid even if delivered after his death, this is not the case for bills of divorce and bills of manumission. The reason is that these documents are completed only when they are handed to the wife or slave, and therefore they are invalidated by the prior death of the husband or master."

            "Introduction to Gittin": [
                "Tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Gittin</span>, according to the accepted arrangement of the tractates of the Mishna, is the penultimate tractate in the order of <span class=\"it-text\">Nashim</span>. This tractate deals mainly with a single topic, the manner in which divorce is performed. The situations in which divorce is permitted, justified, or even obligatory are discussed in other tractates, especially <span class=\"it-text\">Ketubot</span>.", 
                "The uniqueness of divorce is that it cancels the marriage bond, a bond that created the severe prohibition against sexual intercourse with a married woman. This prohibition differs from the prohibition against forbidden relatives, in that it does not result from a blood relationship but is created via an action, i.e., betrothal. In the same way, this prohibition can be canceled by means of an action, i.e., divorce. Admittedly, a divorce does not entirely nullify the marriage bond, as there are several categories of forbidden relatives created by marriage that are not negated by a bill of divorce, e.g., a man is permanently forbidden to his wife's mother and daughter, even if the latter is not his daughter, and he is also forbidden to his wife's sister during his wife's lifetime. Likewise, after divorce the woman remains forbidden to his corresponding relatives. Nevertheless, the main prohibition, which is due to the married status of the woman herself, is canceled by a divorce.", 
                "One fundamental aspect of the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of bills of divorce is the juxtaposition of betrothal to divorce, which is derived from: “And she departs out of his house, and goes and becomes another man's wife” (Deuteronomy 24:2; see 82b). Due to the severity of the consequences of a woman remarrying without having received a proper divorce, the Sages devoted an entire tractate to the clarification of the act of divorce and demanded that it be performed with great precision.", 
                "The manner of a divorce is discussed in the Torah (Deuteronomy 24:1–4) but is treated with extreme brevity, and the Sages derived the many and varied requirements of a bill of divorce both by expounding every word and even every letter of these verses and through applying the detailed traditions of the Oral Law.", 
                "The central feature of a divorce, as stated explicitly in the Torah and clarified by the Sages, is that the husband gives the wife a document that is called a bill of divorce in the language of the Sages. This document serves to release her from the marriage bond with him. In a betrothal, it is the man who betroths and marries the woman; so too, a divorce is performed by transmission of the document from the husband to his wife.", 
                "Since the transmission of the bill of divorce from husband to wife effects the divorce and the consequent halakhic change in the woman's status, the document itself is an essential part of an act of divorce. Unlike bills of sale or other contracts, the main purpose of this document is not to serve as a written record of an act that was performed but rather to make that very act occur. Consequently, a bill of divorce must be written in the form of a declaration on the part of the husband: I hereby divorce. It is not written as a testimony. Furthermore, the document must be composed specifically for the particular couple undergoing the divorce. Although the Sages dispute whether this latter principle refers to the stage of writing, signing, or transmission, the principle itself is accepted unanimously.", 
                "As stated above, the content of a bill of divorce is a declaration on the part of the husband that he is releasing his wife from all ties to him. The Torah states that this must be a “severance” (Deuteronomy 24:1), i.e., it must completely sever the marriage bond. Problems arise if the husband adds conditions to a bill of divorce, as the imposition of certain conditions can prevent the full severance of the ties between husband and wife.", 
                "A bill of divorce effects the divorce itself and also serves as a document of proof, both with regard to matters involving prohibitions, e.g., from when is the woman considered divorced and permitted to all men apart from priests, and with regard to monetary obligations. The woman becomes entirely responsible for her own finances upon her divorce, and any property of hers that was held by her former husband reverts to her possession. Consequently, a bill of divorce must include a date and witnesses, like other legal documents.", 
                "The requirement of a “scroll of severance” (Deuteronomy 24:1) entails that the written document be authentic and reliable. To this end, it is necessary to define carefully the act of writing that fulfills the verse “And he writes her” (Deuteronomy 24:1). Similarly, it is important to determine what is considered a bill for the purposes of this <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>. Due to the possibly grave consequences of a bill of divorce, the Sages were particular about its wording and manner of composition. These details are significant both so that the divorce will in fact be effective and to prevent the husband or anyone else from contesting the validity of the document.", 
                "The second part of the act of divorce is the transmission of the bill of divorce from husband to wife. The Torah states: “And gives it in her hand” (Deuteronomy 24:1). The Sages derived from the verses that the bill of divorce need not literally be given into her hand. Rather, in this context her hand means her domain. Therefore, a bill of divorce can be transmitted via an agent, both an agent appointed by the husband to give the document to his wife, i.e., an agent for delivery, as well as an agent appointed by the woman to receive the bill of divorce from her husband on her behalf, i.e., an agent for receipt. The option to transmit a bill of divorce through the medium of an agent is important, as this enables a woman to be released from her ties to her husband even if she is located far from him. However, the possibility of divorce through an agent can also lead to many complications. For example, the husband might wish to nullify the bill of divorce or the agency, or he might later contest the validity of the document by claiming that it is a forgery. For the betterment of the world and to help deserted wives, the Sages instituted various ordinances whose requirements have become part of the act of divorce. These ordinances include the requirement that agents who deliver a bill of divorce to a different country must state the declaration: It was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence, and the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> is that a husband can nullify a bill of divorce he has sent only if he makes his decision known to the agent to whom he gave the document.", 
                "Mainly in the fourth and fifth chapters, tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Gittin</span> includes a long list of rabbinic decrees and ordinances that relate to all walks of life and that are designed for the betterment of the world, i.e., to prevent certain mishaps and stumbling blocks, and for the betterment of people, i.e., to establish various social arrangements to prevent interpersonal quarrels and disputes.", 
                "As do other tractates, <span class=\"it-text\">Gittin</span> includes aggadic portions, some of which elucidate issues discussed in the tractate, while others are cited incidentally. Two large sections of <span class=\"it-text\">aggada</span> are unrelated to the main topic of the tractate. The first section, in the fifth chapter, is a discussion of the destruction of the Temple and the devastation of Eretz Yisrael, and the second section, in the seventh chapter, provides a list of medical treatments and folk remedies. At the end of the tractate, there is an aggadic section that deals with divorce in general. Although halakhically a husband may divorce his wife even for superficial reasons, the Gemara stresses that it is important to avoid divorce whenever possible, especially from the wife of one's youth.", 
                "There are nine chapters in this tractate. Generally, they all address various matters relating to divorce. While there is some overlap between the chapters concerning the topics they discuss, each chapter has a primary focus: ", 
                "Chapter One deals with bills of divorce sent via an agent when the husband and wife are in different locations. Additionally, it compares and contrasts the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of bills of divorce and bills of manumission.", 
                "Chapter Two delineates additional <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> concerning agency with regard to bills of divorce. It also mentions stringencies associated with the writing of a bill of divorce.", 
                "Chapter Three explains the requirement that a bill of divorce be written for the sake of the husband and wife using it. Another topic discussed in this chapter is the application of the following presumption: One who was alive, remains alive; an item that was in existence, remains in existence.", 
                "Chapter Four analyzes several ordinances that the Sages instituted for the betterment of the world, both with regard to divorce and with regard to other matters. Another topic discussed in this chapter is the emancipation of slaves.", 
                "Chapter Five discusses the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> and ordinances associated with collecting payment of a marriage contract. Other ordinances, primarily relating to avoiding monetary disputes, are mentioned as well.", 
                "Chapter Six explains matters concerning the appointment of an agent, particularly with regard to the writing, delivery, and reception of bills of divorce. ", 
                "Chapter Seven discusses who is fit to grant a divorce. It also enumerates stipulations that are often included in bills of divorce.", 
                "Chapter Eight reviews the manner by which one must transmit a bill of divorce in order for the divorce to take effect. Additionally, it discusses bills of divorce that are disqualified for a variety of reasons, e.g., the way they were written, the disqualification of the witnesses, or because they were given before they should have been given.", 
                "Chapter Nine discusses qualifications and limitations added to the text of a bill of divorce. It also specifies the manner in which witnesses sign a bill of divorce and explains under which circumstances one is permitted or even encouraged to divorce."

            "Introduction to Perek VI": [
                "This chapter continues the treatment of the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of agency with regard to a bill of divorce, primarily in two areas: The different forms of agency to facilitate transfer of the bill of divorce from husband to wife and the halakhic ramifications of those methods, and the various methods through which one designates representatives to write and deliver a bill of divorce to the wife.", 
                "There are two primary forms of agency to facilitate transfer of the bill of divorce. The first is agency for delivery, in which the husband designates the agent and the divorce takes effect only when the bill of divorce reaches the woman. The second is agency for receipt, in which the agent is a representative of the woman, and the divorce takes effect at the moment the bill of divorce reaches the agent, before the woman receives it.", 
                "Due to the fundamental differences between these two forms of agency, there are numerous halakhic ramifications with regard to the choice of the form of agency. In this chapter, several related dilemmas are explored, e.g., whether the woman can designate an agent for delivery; what the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha </span>is in a case where the agent, knowingly or unwittingly, characterizes his agency in a manner that differs from his designation; and how one designates an agent for receipt.", 
                "There are additional differences that stem from the time that the bill of divorce takes effect. For example, in what case and until when can the husband void the bill of divorce? And from when is there concern that the divorce took effect? The latter has ramifications with regard to an Israelite woman married to a priest, as she may no longer partake of <span class=\"it-text\">teruma </span>once the divorce takes effect.", 
                "When appointing agents to deliver the bill of divorce, the husband is required to tell them to write the bill of divorce and deliver it to his wife, <span class=\"it-text\">ab initio</span>. The Sages ask what the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> is if the husband deviates from that formula in designating the agent. They also analyze a case where the husband says only: Write a bill of divorce for my wife. Although in this statement he does not explicitly state that he wants the bill of divorce to be given, in exigent circumstances the court assumes that he intended for the bill of divorce to be given, not only written. It is necessary to determine in which cases one may presume that it was the husband's intent to write and deliver the bill of divorce and in which cases one may presume that his intent was to write the bill of divorce but not to deliver it. ", 
                "Other dilemmas raised in this chapter relate to the nature of the agent's obligation. Is he required to write and deliver the bill of divorce himself, or may he designate others to perform those actions in his place?", 
                "Resolution of these dilemmas is the primary focus of this chapter."

It continues to examine the topic of conditional divorce, which was discussed in Chapter Seven. The conditions, or qualifications, that are discussed here are those that invalidate the divorce entirely, either because they negate the essence of the bill of divorce as a scroll of severance, i.e., a document that severs the bond between husband and wife, or because they cannot be fulfilled. The chapter discusses cases in which the qualification nullifies the divorce, those in which the qualification is disregarded and the divorce is valid, and those in which the divorce and the qualification are both valid.", 
                "A second topic analyzed is the formulation of a bill of divorce. Both the essential, critical formula of the bill of divorce, and the manner in which it should be written <span class=\"it-text\">ab initio</span> are discussed.", 
                "The chapter also continues to explore a topic that began in the previous chapter, namely, bills of divorce that were written in a manner that is valid by Torah law but not in accordance with the ordinances of the Sages.", 
                "In addition, the chapter details a list of problems that arise when two or more bills of divorce are written on the same paper and it is unclear which bill or bills of divorce the witnesses intended to sign. Cases dealt with are those of bills of divorce that were written one above the other, in opposite directions from one another, one beneath the other, or one next to the other. The latter case can be even more complicated if the witnesses signed in different languages from one another.", 
                "Different forms of witnesses' signatures on the bill of divorce are also delineated, e.g., a witness's signature with or without his father's name, with or without adding the word witness, and the use of a nickname for the signature.", 
                "Another topic discussed is the manner in which rumors are treated vis-à-vis a woman's marital status. The chapter describes which rumors are treated seriously and which rumors are not, and whether or not a rumor that is found to be baseless should be suppressed by the court.",

This is the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> only if these properties currently belong to the debtor. If these properties were sold to another, even if they are liened to the creditor, collection is first performed from whatever property the debtor currently owns, regardless of its quality.",

If one who did this type of damage then dies, his inheritors are not required to pay for the damage caused.", 
                "To encourage robbers to repent, the Sages instituted that they do not need to return the actual stolen item if doing so entails significant financial loss. Rather, they can return its value. For example, if one stole a beam and built it into a house, he is not required to dismantle the house.", 
                "A transaction performed under duress is of no significance. For example, if a married woman agrees to sell her property to another when pressured to do so by her husband, the sale is not effective.

In this case, some degree of compensation must be paid to the prior owner.",

Any qualification that limits the wife's right to remarry, e.g., a condition that she will not marry a certain man, negates the essence of the divorce and therefore invalidates it. By contrast, a condition that restricts the wife for only a limited period of time, or one that predicates the divorce on a specific action, even a prohibited action, which the woman is capable of performing, is a valid condition, and the divorce is therefore valid as well. If the condition cannot be fulfilled by the wife, the divorce is valid and the condition is null. Any condition written in the essential part of the bill of divorce invalidates it.",

These are a case in which the bill of divorce was written by the husband but was not signed by witnesses, a case in which it was signed by one witness, and a case in which the date was not written on it. According to the accepted <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>, if the bill of divorce was given to the wife in the presence of two witnesses, it is valid <span class=\"it-text\">ab initio</span> even if it was not signed by any witnesses, as the witnesses of the transmission of the bill of divorce effect the divorce.",

Similarly, a master emancipates a half-maidservant half-free woman if doing so will lead to a reduction in licentious behavior. A master emancipates a slave sold to a gentile, or to a Jew outside of Eretz Yisrael, in order to enable him to continue fulfilling the mitzvot as he had until that point.

                "This chapter deals primarily with two topics, although as is common in the Talmud it addresses other subjects as well. One topic is a continuation of the discussion concerning the writing of a bill of divorce. The verse states that a bill of divorce must be written “for her,” from which the Sages derived a requirement that the bill of divorce be written for the sake of the woman being divorced. A bill of divorce cannot be reused by another person after the original recipient of it was divorced; it must be written specifically with regard to the couple themselves. Although this is agreed upon by all, there is still room for deliberation as to the precise parameters of a bill of divorce written for the sake of the woman, and whether the entire text of the bill of divorce, or only part of it, must be written specifically for her sake. This is also related to the debate as to whether the writing of the bill of divorce refers to the literal writing of the bill of divorce, or whether the signing of the bill of divorce is considered the principal act of writing it.", 
                "Since a bill of divorce that was not written for the sake of the woman is not valid, a question arises with regard to a situation where the bill of divorce was lost and subsequently found. The Gemara examines the circumstances in which there may be concern that although the bill of divorce contains the same names as the lost bill of divorce, in fact it may not be the original bill of divorce and cannot be used.", 
                "The husband need not transmit the bill of divorce to his wife in person; rather, he may appoint an agent to transmit it. This chapter addresses an aspect of that <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>, as the agent can be sent to a distant place and might not know for certain whether the husband is still alive when he transmits the bill of divorce to the wife. As the Gemara explained previously, in the first chapter, the bill of divorce is effective only if it is received during the husband's lifetime. Although in this situation the marriage has definitely been terminated, as the wife is either divorced or widowed, there are practical differences between the two situations: If the wife is widowed, she might be obligated in levirate marriage, and if she is divorced she is prohibited from marrying a priest. The principal concern is the extent to which one may rely on the presumption that a person or item remains in their current state. This question becomes particularly germane in situations where a significant amount of time has passed, or where events transpire that could cause a change in the presumed status. This issue arises with regard to the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of divorce, but the Gemara also discusses its broader implications.", 
                "Another issue explored in this chapter, also related to the matter of agents, is the question of whether or not an agent is empowered to appoint another agent in his stead. The Gemara details the conditions under which it is permitted or prohibited to do so."

Under such circumstances the husband may give a bill of divorce that will take effect only once a certain period of time has passed or a specific condition has been fulfilled.

Likewise, the wife can designate an agent, male or female, to receive the bill of divorce, in which case the divorce takes effect once the document reaches the agent. There must be two men witnessing the designation of the agent for receipt, and there must be two men witnessing the document being handed to the agent. ",

Once a woman designates an agent for receipt, she must act stringently, as if she already received the bill of divorce from the husband or his agent. For instance, if she was the wife of a priest, it is prohibited for her to partake of <span class=\"it-text\">teruma </span>from the moment of designation. An adult woman may designate an agent for receipt, and the father may designate an agent for receipt for his betrothed daughter who is a minor.", 
                "In designating an agent to write and deliver a bill of divorce to his wife, the husband must clearly state that he seeks to divorce his wife. If he expressed his intention ambiguously, the agent may not deliver the bill of divorce on his behalf. If the husband says: Write a bill of divorce for my wife, it is not considered designation of an agent for delivery; nevertheless, in exigent circumstances, e.g., if he is taken out for execution, if he departs on a long journey, or if he is dangerously ill, his intention is presumably not only that the agents write the document but that they deliver it as well.", 
                "The same is true with regard to a husband located in a dangerous area. Even if it is impossible to determine his identity beyond a shadow of a doubt, allowances are made in order to avoid rendering the woman a deserted wife. In principle, if a healthy man says: Write a bill of divorce for my wife, the agents have no mandate to deliver it. However, if it is discovered that the husband intended to later commit suicide, the agents deliver the bill of divorce based on the assumption that this was the husband's intention and that he failed to articulate that intention due to his preoccupation.",

If they do not know how to write, they must learn to do so and write the document. If the husband told a group of people to write a bill of divorce for his wife, one of them writes the document and two sign it. If he said: All of you write a bill of divorce for my wife, they are all required to sign it. Failure to do so, even if one of them died, voids the bill of divorce, as they did not fulfill the condition.

                "From the verses, it is apparent that a sister-in-law requiring levirate marriage is bound to her brother-in-law and cannot marry another man until he releases her from the levirate bond via levirate marriage or <span class=\"it-text\">halitza</span>. The Torah itself, however, does not provide any definition of this bond. Perhaps the bond can be understood simply as a one-sided obligation, whereby the sister-in-law is compelled to wait for her brother-in-law to perform some act. This opinion asserts that the levirate bond is not substantial. Alternatively, one could explain that the levirate bond is substantial, and the relationship between the parties obligated in levirate marriage is similar to that of those who are engaged, in that it would be prohibited for the <span class=\"it-text\">yavam</span> to marry the relatives of the <span class=\"it-text\">yevama</span>, in the same way that it would be prohibited for him to marry the relatives of his wife. Indeed, this perspective raises a certain difficulty, for there should apparently be some difference between the simple case of a <span class=\"it-text\">yevama </span>who is bonded to a single brother-in-law and the case where she is bonded to two brothers-in-law or more. However, by defining the levirate bond as a relationship that is substantial enough to create prohibitions for the parties involved, a fundamental contradiction arises in the case of a woman who is simultaneously bound to two different men.", 
                "Defining the parameters of the levirate relationship is also problematic when complex familial relations exist between the brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law. It must be determined precisely when the levirate bond is formed. Is it formed at the moment of the husband's death, following the opinion that a woman's status at the time of her husband's death determines her status with regard the levirate bond created between her and her brothers-in-law? Or, perhaps the original moment of marriage between the woman and her late husband created a levirate bond between her and her brothers-in-law, following the opinion that marriage determines a woman's status with regard to the levirate bond?",

The only exception is that these marriages can be dissolved not only by means of a divorce or the husband's death, but also by means of refusal on the part of the minor girl. This sort of marriage of a minor takes effect only if she is mature enough to understand what it means to be married, consents to it, and is capable of taking care of the money used in her betrothal. If these conditions are not fulfilled, she is not married and does not even need to refuse. ",

The declaration of refusal does not have a fixed text nor does it require the presence of a court. It is sufficient that she indicate in the presence of witnesses that she does not want to be married, and her marriage is instantly dissolved retroactively. Since the refusal annuls the marriage entirely, all prohibitions associated with that relationship are dissolved as well. The exception to this is that the Sages decreed that she may not remarry a husband who divorced her after she was married to another man. ",

The <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> with regard to two minor girls who were widowed by childless husbands parallels that of two adult women in every way. However, a minor widowed by a childless husband does not have the same status as an adult <span class=\"it-text\">yevama</span>. If the minor is a forbidden relative, her being a <span class=\"it-text\">yevama</span> does not exempt an adult rival wife as it would if both were adults.

In this regard, the tradition of the Sages in unambiguous: The mitzva of levirate marriage overrides the prohibition with regard to a brother's wife alone, not those who are forbidden by another prohibition. However, the precise halakhic definition of this tradition must be clarified. Does this mean that the mitzva of levirate marriage does not apply at all in these cases, and the prohibition against marrying a brother's wife remains in force, as in the case of a deceased brother who did have children? Or is this a case in which the mitzva of levirate marriage applies, but due to other prohibitions it cannot be performed in practice, and the <span class=\"it-text\">yavam</span> must perform <span class=\"it-text\">halitza</span> instead?

The Gemara then considered the steps that must be taken in all marriages to prevent such uncertainties from arising and to ensure that the lineage of the Jewish people is clear and apparent.

                "<span class=\"it-text\">Yevamot</span> is the first tractate in the order of <span class=\"it-text\">Nashim</span>. Admittedly, some commentaries place <span class=\"it-text\">Yevamot</span> after <span class=\"it-text\">Gittin </span>(Meiri), but this is not widely accepted. While the tractate focuses mainly on the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot </span>of levirate marriage, the elucidation of these <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> necessitates an in-depth clarification of the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of marriage in general. These include forbidden and disqualified marriages, i.e., those women with whom relations are forbidden with a certain man, whether by Torah law or by rabbinic law, as well as the definition and severity of these prohibitions. Consequently, the comprehensive discussions of tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Yevamot</span> form the basis of the entire order of <span class=\"it-text\">Nashim</span>.", 
                "As stated above, in addition to the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of levirate marriage, this tractate serves as an important and sometimes the only source for various aspects of forbidden sexual relations, as well as the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of converts and conversion, and the definition of separation between man and wife, which concerns mainly the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of refusal and the case of a deserted wife. Many of these discussions are complemented in <span class=\"it-text\">Kiddushin</span>, the last tractate in <span class=\"it-text\">Nashim</span>.", 
                "The issue of levirate marriage is explicitly stated in the Torah in only one short passage (Deuteronomy 25:5–10). In addition, there are two episodes in the Bible that are connected to the idea of levirate marriage: The incident involving Judah, his sons, and Tamar (Genesis, chapter 38), and the marriage of Ruth and Boaz (Ruth, chapters 3–4). Both early and later commentaries discuss the relationship between these stories and the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of levirate marriage set out in Deuteronomy. In any case, levirate marriage, as well as being a far-from-rare occurrence, is such a fundamental concept that an entire tractate is devoted its many details, on both the theoretical and the practical levels.", 
                "Levirate marriage is a novel <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>; see the Gemara on 17b. In other words, it deviates from the norms of the legal system of the Torah. Generally, one who engages in relations with the wife of his brother violates a severe prohibition that makes him liable to <span class=\"it-text\">karet</span> (Leviticus 18:16, 20:21). However, if this woman's husband dies childless, not only is she permitted to the brother, it is actually a mitzva for him to marry her. Since forbidden sexual relationships are among the most severe of Torah prohibitions, indeed one of the three cardinal sins for which one must allow himself to be killed rather than transgress, the fact that one is permitted and even commanded to marry his brother's wife renders levirate marriage a highly exceptional case.", 
                "Several halakhic discussions in this tractate concern the basic question of whether the mitzva of levirate marriage merely overrides the prohibition with regard to a brother's wife to a limited extent, or whether, in these special circumstances, the prohibition does not apply at all. One of the ways the Sages express this dialectic tension is with the statement that the verses “You shall not uncover the nakedness of your brother's wife” (Leviticus 18:16) and “Her brother-in-law will have intercourse with her” (Deuteronomy 25:5) were pronounced together (Jerusalem Talmud, <span class=\"it-text\">Nedarim</span> 3:5). ", 
                "According to this line of reasoning, it is incorrect to say that a forbidden sexual relationship is permitted in the case of levirate marriage. In fact, the opposite is the case: The mitzva of levirate marriage applies only when no prohibition is in effect. If a potential levirate marriage would violate any other forbidden sexual relationship apart from that of a brother's wife, not only is there no mitzva to marry the woman, the obligation of levirate marriage does not apply in this case at all and she is actually forbidden to the brother. ", 
                "Levirate marriage is unique not only with regard to the performance of the mitzva itself, but also in the fact that the obligation can be released by the act of <span class=\"it-text\">halitza</span>. Typically, the Torah imposes either absolute obligations that every Jew must fulfill at all times, e.g., the love of God; or mitzvot that are incumbent upon certain people part of the time, such as donning phylacteries; or commandments that apply if particular conditions are met, e.g., the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of commerce or ritual slaughtering. In all these cases, once the mitzva is in force, one cannot release himself from the obligation. ", 
                "By contrast, the option of <span class=\"it-text\">halitza</span> effectively provides the brother-in-law with the choice of whether or not he wants to perform levirate marriage. Consequently, the Sages apparently viewed <span class=\"it-text\">halitza</span> not as the negation of levirate marriage but as an alternative mitzva. Accordingly, the Torah allows the brother-in-law in this situation to select between two equivalent mitzvot. Some even maintain that <span class=\"it-text\">halitza</span> is preferable to levirate marriage; see 39b. This issue is also possibly connected to the debate in the Jerusalem Talmud as to whether <span class=\"it-text\">halitza</span> is itself a form of acquisition or simply an act that exempts the brother-in-law and releases the <span class=\"it-text\">yevama</span>. ", 
                "With these points in mind, these mitzvot can be explained in the following terms. When a man dies childless, he leaves behind a void in a soul that was unable to come to full fruition in the world. Consequently, his surviving brother must replace him by marrying his widow. In this manner the surviving brother is considered to be continuing his late brother's life. For this reason, by Torah law there is no new ritual of betrothal or a wedding ceremony in the case of levirate marriage, as it carries on the previous bond. This consideration also affects the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of inheritance and the marriage contract, among other matters. If the brother-in-law bears a child he is viewed as completing his brother's mission.", 
                "See the Ramban's Commentary on the Torah with regard to both the episode of Judah and Tamar and the chapter on levirate marriage itself, where he discusses the fundamental idea of levirate marriages in light of these passages. Indeed, the story of Judah and Tamar, among other things, teaches the great responsibility of this task and the punishment of those who refuse to fulfill it in the proper manner.", 
                "Conversely, <span class=\"it-text\">halitza</span> is essentially a ritual of atonement and purification, through which the brother-in-law and his <span class=\"it-text\">yevama</span> are released from their mutual bond and from the weighty obligation placed on their shoulders. Moreover, this is the means by which the life cycle of the deceased brother is brought to a close. ", 
                "Another feature of levirate marriage is that in contrast to a regular marriage, in which the man chooses the woman he wishes to wed, the <span class=\"it-text\">yevama</span> and brother-in-law are tied together by a decree of the Torah. This connection, called by the Sages the levirate bond, is one of the central topics of the tractate. Some Sages view this link as merely an obligation to marry a particular woman, which in practical terms simply means that she is not permitted to marry anyone else until the obligation has been released by means of <span class=\"it-text\">halitza</span>. This opinion is expressed as: There is no bond. However, the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> is that there is a bond, i.e., the link between a brother-in-law and a <span class=\"it-text\">yevama</span> is virtually akin to a marital bond, as she is considered betrothed to him to a certain extent. One of the ramifications of this ruling is that her close female relatives are forbidden to the brother-in-law. ", 
                "In light of the above, to preserve the boundaries of modesty and to prevent any miscomprehension of the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot </span>of marriage, the Sages enacted that a brother-in-law should perform an act of betrothal with his <span class=\"it-text\">yevama</span>. This is called a <span class=\"it-text\">ma'amar</span>, a levirate betrothal. Furthermore, if he gives her a bill of divorce while she is waiting for either levirate marriage or <span class=\"it-text\">halitza</span>, his act is effective to a certain extent. On the one hand, these rabbinic enactments draw levirate marriage closer to a regular marriage, but on the other hand they can cause many problems for the marriage and for <span class=\"it-text\">halitza</span>. ", 
                "Likewise, other decrees of the Sages involving marriage, such as those concerning the marriage of a minor girl who is an orphan and the annulment of this tie by her refusal of her husband, as well as the marriage of deaf-mutes, also complicate the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot </span>of levirate marriage, despite the fact that these enactments serve the public welfare. Some of these prohibitions stem from sanctity, i.e., they were enacted in order to preserve the sanctity of the Jewish people or the priesthood, and some of them apply to the entire people, such as having a sexual relationship with a <span class=\"it-text\">mamzer</span> or a man with crushed genitals or other genital wounds, or with converts from different nations. Other forbidden sexual relationships are secondary forbidden relatives prohibited by rabbinic law. ", 
                "All these cases require not only a thorough analysis on their own account, but they must be properly defined before one can establish the relationship between these marriages and levirate marriage, which applies by Torah law. This matter concerns the validity of levirate marriage and <span class=\"it-text\">halitza</span>, the whole range of monetary issues that arise with regard to inheritance and the marriage contract, and the concomitant prohibitions and rights, e.g., the permission to partake of <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span> and the conditions of the marriage contract.", 
                "Furthermore, numerous other problems with levirate marriage can result from various causes, either due to complicated family relationships, e.g., if the <span class=\"it-text\">yevama</span> is permitted to only one of several brothers, or if a few deaths occur in succession, or because of factual or halakhic uncertainties. These might be doubts with regard to the halakhic and family status of a certain person, or unclear and possibly erroneous testimony concerning someone's death.", 
                "The debates and analysis of all these problems, both separately and in various combinations, is why tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Yevamot</span> is considered one of the hardest, most complex tractates in the entire Talmud. ", 
                "Tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Yevamot</span> is comprised of sixteen chapters. Some deal with one clearly defined topic, while others discuss several issues spread over different chapters.", 
                "Chapter One focuses on the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of women to whom the duty of levirate marriage does not apply, either because they are among those with whom relations are forbidden or for some other reason. Additionally, the chapter discusses the basic halakhic principles of when one mitzva overrides another.", 
                "Chapter Two deals with the prohibition with regard to the wife of a brother with whom the <span class=\"it-text\">yavam</span> did not coexist. It also discusses the basic principles of the types of women who are obligated in levirate marriages, and those who have no option but to perform <span class=\"it-text\">halitza</span> due to a prohibition that would be violated by a sexual relationship; whether it is a definite or an uncertain prohibition, and whether it applies by Torah law or by rabbinic law.", 
                "Chapter Three discusses those cases in which women who are relatives of each other are liable in levirate marriage, as well as a woman who is bound by an obligation of levirate marriage with two brothers.", 
                "Chapter Four contains many topics: The case of erroneous <span class=\"it-text\">halitza</span> and levirate marriage, the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of inheritance and the marriage contract of a brother-in-law and his <span class=\"it-text\">yevama</span>, the basic definitions of <span class=\"it-text\">mamzer</span> status, and the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of conversion.", 
                "Chapter Five discusses a single issue: The validity of a levirate betrothal [<span class=\"it-text\">ma'amar</span>] and the bill of divorce of a brother-in-law to his <span class=\"it-text\">yevama</span>, including all various permutations and combinations of these actions. ", 
                "Chapter Six deals with the definition and <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of the act of intercourse, particularly with regard to a <span class=\"it-text\">yevama</span>, but also as it concerns marital relations in general. A portion of the chapter also discusses the prohibitions that apply only to priests, specifically to the High Priest, and the mitzva to be fruitful and multiply. ", 
                "Chapter Seven focuses on the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of partaking of <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span> as they apply to the daughter or the wife of a priest, and those actions that disqualify them from eating <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span>.", 
                "Chapter Eight discusses physical blemishes, particularly genital defects. These have ramifications with regard to eating <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span>, permitted sexual relations, and the definition of a eunuch and a sexually underdeveloped woman [<span class=\"it-text\">aylonit</span>], statuses that affect their eligibility for levirate marriage, among other matters.", 
                "Chapter Nine provides a list of women who are forbidden to a husband, a <span class=\"it-text\">yavam</span>, or both.

It also defines the shoe used for <span class=\"it-text\">halitza</span> and discusses other aspects of the ritual.", 
                "Chapter Thirteen focuses mainly on issues that arise from problematic marriages, e.g., the marriage of a minor girl and its annulment through refusal; and the broader topic of the marriage of incompetents, such as minors, deaf-mutes, and imbeciles.", 
                "Chapter Fourteen is concerned with the marriage of deaf-mutes and its halakhic status, both concerning the rights ensuing from marriage and the possibility of levirate marriage.",

            "Summary of Perek XV": [
                "The Sages instituted that a woman testifying with regard to the death of her husband is deemed credible. This is highly significant, as she can thereby permit herself to marry, enter into levirate marriage, and also to actualize her rights from the marriage contract. However, the Sages placed limits on this credibility: She is not deemed credible if there is any suspicion that she came to this conclusion in reliance upon her own reasoning, if she was influenced by her bad relations with her husband, or if she testifies about an unclear situation. Likewise, this testimony is limited in that it is accepted only with regard to the woman herself. Others may not rely upon her testimony for monetary matters or with regard to marriage.", 
                "In cases of contradictory testimonies concerning the death of a husband, the Sages established that as one witness is considered like two witnesses in this type of testimony, the court relies upon the testimony of the first witness even when it is refuted by another witness. However, if there are two witnesses who testify that the husband is still alive, their testimony refutes that of a lone witness who testifies that he died. Furthermore, as disqualified witnesses are trusted in testimony of this kind, the majority is followed in conflicts involving these testimonies.", 
                "Another limitation to the credibility of a woman who testifies about her husband's death is that she is not trusted to testify with regard to certain close relatives whose kinship is established through marriage, as she is suspected of lying so as to cause them injury or ruin. This principle established by the Sages sometimes leads to strange results: It is possible for a woman to be trusted concerning her husband's death, which means that from then onward her husband is considered dead in every respect as it pertains to her, but at the same time another woman, e.g., her rival wife, is not permitted to remarry based on this testimony. Consequently, in relation to the rival wife the husband is considered alive in every respect."

                "Prohibitions with regard to sexual intercourse between a man and a woman who are related through marriage apply only if they are related through actual marriage, not through nonmarital intercourse. Therefore, a man is permitted by Torah law to marry the close relatives of a woman he raped or seduced. However, the Sages decreed that this is prohibited, lest he continue his relationship with her even after marrying her relative. Marrying a woman who was raped or seduced by one's father, on the other hand, is permitted by rabbinic law as well. This can potentially cause the formation of bizarre family relationships that are recognized by <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>.", 
                "Conversely, gentile relatives who convert to Judaism are not considered relatives by Torah law at all, neither with regard to levirate marriage nor with regard to prohibited sexual intercourse. The same is true with regard to slave relatives who get freed by their masters. Here too, some Sages maintain that with regard to prohibited sexual intercourse, certain relatives are considered related by rabbinic law even after conversion, lest people be lenient with regard to non-convert relatives as well. Additionally, there is a concern lest a convert believe that he converted from higher to lesser sanctity, as relatives who were permitted to him as a gentile are now permitted as well.", 
                "Twin brothers whose mother converted while she was pregnant with them are considered related by Torah law with regard to prohibited sexual relations, but not with regard to levirate marriage. Brothers whose mother converted before their conception are considered related with regard to all matters.", 
                "The chapter's rulings with regard to cases of intermingled children conformed to the principle of uncertainty in Torah law, i.e., the stringent <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of both sides are accepted to ensure that no prohibitions will be transgressed.", 
                "If the sons of a priest and his maidservant are intermingled, although the stringent <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of both sides are accepted, they partake of <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span>, as slaves of priests partake of <span class=\"it-text\">teruma </span>as well. When they grow up, they must release one another, as it is unknown which of them is the slave and which is the master. Afterward, they are considered uncertain priests and must follow the stringencies of both priests and of Israelites.",

The most ancient rabbinic dispute in a halakhic matter known to us is discussed in this chapter. It concerns whether or not one may place his hands on the head of the Festival offering. Another related dispute concerns the types of offerings one is allowed to bring on the actual day of the Festival: Whether only peace-offerings, most of which are consumed by the owner and the priests, are permitted, or whether one may also bring burnt-offerings, although people do not consume them.",

The pilgrims were accustomed to bringing their <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span> and tithes along with them, in accordance with rabbinic ordinances and decrees. It was therefore necessary to review the laws of ritual purity and impurity regarding these items and others. According to both Torah law and rabbinic law, with regard to the laws of ritual impurity and the process of purification, there are differences between non-sacred food, <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span>, and sacred offerings.

Some of these stringencies have a basis in the Torah or are hinted at in verses, but they were expanded in scope and breadth by the Sages. Others are rabbinic decrees designed to avoid outright contamination of the sacred food. On the other hand, in view of the fact that everyone, including <span class=\"it-text\">amei ha'aretz</span>, adhered to the strictest standards in the preparation of sacrificial items, the Sages relied on <span class=\"it-text\">amei ha'aretz</span> for certain matters pertaining to sacrificial food, though ordinarily such people were not considered trustworthy regarding issues of ritual impurity.", 
                "In actuality the trustworthiness afforded by the Sages in matters pertaining to sacrificial food was expanded beyond the sacrifices themselves, and was applied as well to other items that have a relationship to sacrifices. Consequently, the people of Judea, which is in close proximity to the Temple, were considered more trustworthy than others regarding the observance of ritual purity. The Sages showed leniency regarding certain other matters pertaining to the honor and sanctity of Jerusalem.", 
                "Perhaps most sweeping of all was the leniency shown by the Sages during the time of the pilgrim Festivals. These occasions, when all of Israel assembled before God at the Temple, were considered times in which it was possible to rely completely on <span class=\"it-text\">amei ha'aretz</span> in all matters regarding ritual purity. This was based on the necessity to maintain harmony among all the various factions and individuals in Israel at this time of unity, when, in the words of the biblical verse, “All the men of Israel gathered...knit together [<span class=\"it-text\">haverim</span>] as one man” (Judges 20:11)."

An additional difference between levels of purity pertains to washing one's hands from the impurity.

                "With regard to the question of who is obligated to ascend to the Temple on the pilgrimage Festivals, the Gemara established several general principles. First of all, as this is a positive, time-bound mitzva, only men are obligated to ascend to the Temple, in accordance with the verse: “All your males” (Exodus 23:17), which includes emancipated slaves. Children who have reached the age of training in mitzvot are obligated by rabbinic law. Excluded from this obligation are women and slaves, even if they are half-free. Second, one who is unable to ascend by foot, due to either illness or weakness, is likewise exempt from the mitzva. Furthermore, a man is who unable to arrive together with the rest of the Jewish people because everyone shuns his company is also exempt. ", 
                "The Festival offerings must be worth a minimum amount. The burnt-offering of appearance must be at least one silver <span class=\"it-text\">ma'a</span> in value, while the Festival peace-offering must be worth no less than two <span class=\"it-text\">ma'a</span>. However, there is no set value for the other peace-offering brought on a Festival, the peace-offering of rejoicing. The obligatory offerings for which there is a fixed sum must be brought from non-sacred funds, although one can add money designated for other offerings to increase the size of the peace-offering.", 
                "The general obligation to rejoice on the pilgrimage Festivals applies to women as well as men. However, in the case of men this obligation is fulfilled in a defined manner, by eating the peace-offerings of rejoicing. This mitzva is performed through the consumption of any animal offering that may be eaten.", 
                "The main mitzva of Festival offerings applies on the first Festival day. However, one who neglected to sacrifice his offerings on the first day can redress this deficiency on the rest of the days of the Festival. In the case of <span class=\"it-text\">Shavuot</span>, redress can be performed even after the Festival, as will be explained in the next chapter.", 
                "Incidental to these <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span>, this chapter discussed two broader issues: Which transgressions of positive mitzvot and prohibitions can be remedied by means of repentance, and which cannot be fully atoned for through repentance alone. It also analyzed the relationship between those <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> that are explained in great depth by the Sages and their sources in the Torah itself, especially those whose source verse is brief and obscure, occasionally no more than a mere allusion."

                "The Torah stresses several times its insistence on maintaining <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span> and sacrificial items in a state of ritual purity, as well as the severe penalties for eating <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span> or sacrificial food in a state of ritual impurity. In light of the Torah's directives to make safeguards for its commandments in general and for the maintenance of ritual purity for holy foods in particular, the Sages instituted various stringencies and decrees in order to, in their words: Make safeguards for the safeguards.", 
                "These rabbinic safeguards and decrees for the maintenance of ritual purity are stricter or more lenient in accordance with the level of sanctity of the item for which they were intended. Thus, they were more stringent regarding sacrificial food than regarding <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span>, and stricter still for the purification ashes of the red heifer. ", 
                "The concept of instituting stricter standards for sacrificial food is found in the Torah itself. To this the Sages added various decrees to the effect that the slightest possibility of defilement or lack of care in the handling of sacrificial food should render it unfit or impure. The difference between unfit and impure is that the former would invalidate the item for use but would not defile other foods that came into contact with it, while the latter indicates something whose impurity can be passed on to other sacred foods. ", 
                "Despite this general trend, there are certain situations in which the Sages were stricter with <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span> than with sacrificial food. This is because <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span> is set aside by everyone and is eaten by any priest in his own house, without the rabbinic supervision that prevailed in the Temple's sacrificial service, and not all priests were well versed in the laws or sufficiently meticulous about them. ", 
                "In general, there were many people who lived during the Second Temple period who were not meticulous about observing the laws of ritual purity. These people are referred to as <span class=\"it-text\">amei ha'aretz</span>, common folk, while those who did maintain the strictures of ritual purity at all times were called <span class=\"it-text\">haverim</span>,<span class=\"it-text\"> </span>literally, colleagues. Since <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span> perforce often involved contact with <span class=\"it-text\">amei ha'aretz</span>, the Sages on occasion saw fit to apply stricter standards to <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span> than to sacred foods, for which even <span class=\"it-text\">amei ha'aretz</span> could be relied upon to adhere to the highest standard.", 
                "The elaboration of the Sages' enactments and decrees in these matters, both the strictures they imposed for sacrificial food and the leeway they occasionally granted for an item, in Jerusalem and specifically in the Temple, and especially during the Festival periods, are the major focus of this chapter."

The analysis of these <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> can be divided into two main categories: The offerings which the pilgrims must bring, and ritual purity and impurity, especially those aspects which are relevant to the Festivals.", 
                "The mitzvot of the Torah to ascend to the Temple and to celebrate and rejoice on the Festivals are expressed in both general and specific terms. The general obligation, “Three times a year all your males shall appear before the Lord God” (Exodus 23:17), is supplemented by a practical means of implementation by the Torah itself: “And none shall appear before Me empty-handed” (Exodus 23:15). As is clear from several places in the Torah (e.g., Deuteronomy 12:11–12), this means that pilgrims must bring with them special offerings for the Festivals. In other words, in addition to the fixed, communal Festival offerings, the details of which are set out mainly in Leviticus 23 and Numbers 28–29, each individual pilgrim must sacrifice special offerings brought for the Festival. Similarly, the other, undefined commandments, i.e., the celebration of and rejoicing in the Festival, are fulfilled in a highly practical manner, through the sacrifice of certain animal offerings.", 
                "The Torah itself does not state which offerings must be brought by individuals, as the verses themselves provide mere allusions in this regard. However, by tradition of the Sages there are three types of Festival offerings: The burnt-offering of appearance, the Festival peace-offering, and the peace-offering of rejoicing. Every individual pilgrim who appears before God in the Temple must bring a burnt-offering of appearance. The Festival peace-offering is likewise obligatory, while the peace-offering of rejoicing is a separate offering that has no fixed requirement; it is brought if more meat is necessary for the rejoicing of the Festival. ", 
                "In addition to these offerings, pilgrims would ascend to Jerusalem for the Festivals with the other offerings and gifts they were obligated to bring to the Temple or to the city. These included the various obligatory offerings, e.g., burnt-offerings, sin-offerings and guilt-offerings for specific sins, offerings brought in fulfillment of a vow, firstborns, animal tithe, and second tithe produce and its redemption money. These were typically brought on the Festival, not only for reasons of convenience so as to avoid several trips to Jerusalem, but also because the connection between one's sacrificial obligations and the rejoicing of the Festivals is established by the Torah itself (see, for example, Deuteronomy 12:6–12). ", 
                "The numerous offerings brought by pilgrims raises the problem of the relationship between the obligatory Festival offerings and those which are not connected to the festivities of the day. The general principle that one cannot fulfill the duty to bring one offering by the sacrifice of another is applicable here, and therefore one must bring special offerings for the Festival. However, it is necessary to determine the minimum requirement of these offerings, as well as whether this measure applies by Torah law or whether the Torah simply imposes a general obligation and the Sages established a fixed value for these offerings. In the Jerusalem Talmud (<span class=\"it-text\">Pe'a</span> 1:1 and the beginning of <span class=\"it-text\">Hagiga</span>) this is treated as a general inquiry with regard to all halakhic measurements that are not mentioned in the Torah itself. Conversely, the Babylonian Talmud apparently considers this a specific problem involving the Festival offerings, which are not detailed at all in the Torah. ", 
                "In any case, there are certain ways to combine an obligatory offering with animals or money that are designated for a different offering. Furthermore, they can be used for the fulfillment of the peace-offerings of rejoicing, whose obligation is less clearly delineated than that of the other two categories. ", 
                "The classification of these offerings as Festival offerings raises a series of questions. First, the period of the Festival must be defined: Does it refer only to the Festival itself, or are the intermediate days of the Festival also included? If the obligation applies solely on the Festival day, how should one treat the animals sacrificed thereon? ", 
                "It is prohibited to perform labor on a Festival, and several of the mitzvot of an animal offering involve the performance of labor, especially the placing of one's hands on an offering, an act that is not indispensible for the sacrificial rite. Although these mitzvot were performed regularly, and therefore one would expect there to have been an established custom in this regard, certain details of the rite were nevertheless subject to ancient disputes that were left unresolved. ", 
                "Another topic dealt with in this tractate is the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of ritual purity and impurity. These <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> are tightly bound to the Temple and to consecrated items. In essence, the use of ritually impure objects is not forbidden in and of itself, but only when one will come into contact with <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span> or the Temple and its sacred articles. ", 
                "Nevertheless, many Jews would be careful to remain in a state of ritual purity at all times, even when they dealt with non-sacred objects and foods. These people were called <span class=\"it-text\">haverim</span>. The opposite category of people, i.e., those who were not scrupulous with regard to ritual purity and impurity as well as with regard to several other areas of <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>, were known as <span class=\"it-text\">amei ha'aretz</span>. Due to the care that must be taken to preserve ritual purity, and because of the severity of the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of ritual impurity, which include numerous rabbinic ordinances, the Sages decreed that <span class=\"it-text\">amei ha'aretz</span> should be considered ritually impure at all times. However, this level of caution and separation could be maintained only in the rest of the country and not in the Temple itself, which is shared by all Jews.", 
                "The problem of the ritual purity of sacred articles was resolved in two main ways. On the one hand, the Sages instituted a large number of restrictive decrees with regard to ritual purity and impurity which went far beyond the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of the Torah. These ordinances and restrictions were designed to ensure that no ritual impurity that applied by Torah law would be found in the Temple precincts, especially concerning the red heifer and the waters of the purification offering. On the other hand, even <span class=\"it-text\">amei ha'aretz</span>, who were not particular about the observance of every mitzva, treated the Temple with great respect and were careful about its sanctity and ritual purity. Consequently, they too were considered trustworthy when it came to any questions involving the ritual purity of sacred articles. Furthermore, the Sages added a special decree that applied to the Festival period: When all Jews ascend to Jerusalem for the pilgrimage Festivals they are considered “Knit together [<span class=\"it-text\">haverim</span>] as one man” (Judges 20:11) in every regard. In the words of the psalmist, “Jerusalem is built as a city that is compact together,” at those times when “the tribes ascended there...to give thanks to the name of the Lord” (Psalms 122:3–4). ", 
                "Ritual purity and impurity is the most difficult and complex area of <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>. An entire order of the Mishna is devoted to the analysis of these <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> (see the introduction of the Rambam to the order of <span class=\"it-text\">Teharot</span> in his Commentary on the Mishna). The discussion in tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Hagiga</span> focuses mainly on the differences between the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of ritual purity and impurity in general and their particular application to sacred articles, concerning which many stringencies and higher standards are imposed both by Torah law and by rabbinic law. At the same time, the tractate also deals with the trustworthiness of all Jews in this regard, and the leniencies that are invoked during the pilgrimage Festivals. ", 
                "Incidental to the general discussion concerning the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of the Festival offerings, which are only alluded to in the Torah, an entire section of the tractate deals with areas of the Torah that are not detailed and elucidated in the Torah itself. In some cases these topics are <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot </span>mentioned in Torah in the form of allusions, while their main explication is found in the traditions of the Oral Law. Other matters are kept hidden by their very nature, as they are not meant to be studied by all people. These issues, which were not taught in public lectures, were called <span class=\"it-text\">Ma'aseh Bereshit</span>, the Act of Creation, which deals with the secrets of the creation of the world, and <span class=\"it-text\">Ma'aseh Merkava</span>, the Design of the Divine Chariot, which concerns the lofty, upper world and Divine Providence. ", 
                "Tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Hagiga</span> does not clarify these esoteric subjects, but it does explain their permitted and prohibited areas of inquiry as well as why the Sages were reluctant to publicize these ideas. Moreover, they are not matters of <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> and are not connected at all to the mitzvot of the pilgrimage Festivals, yet the main analysis in the Talmud of these esoteric issues appears in this tractate. Indeed, there is an intimate connection between esoterica, which involve the heavenly entourage and the Temple of above, and tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Hagiga</span>, which deals with the obligations of those pilgrims who ascend to “appear before the Lord God.”",

                "Chapter One deals with the basic pilgrimage obligation and the Festival offerings, as well as the various areas of the Torah that are merely alluded to in the Torah itself and which are elucidated by the tradition of the Sages. ", 
                "Chapter Two covers those matters which may not be taught in public, the manner of bringing offerings on a Festival day, and the differences between the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of ritual purity and impurity as they apply to non-sacred items, <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span>, and the sacred articles of the Temple. ", 
                "Chapter Three discusses the higher standard that is conferred on sacred articles beyond that of <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span>, and the leniencies that the Sages applied to the ritual purity of consecrated items in Jerusalem, particularly during the Festival period."

With the lighting of the Shabbat lights, there is thus an element of delight, as well as deference to Shabbat day. However, since there is a strict prohibition against kindling fire or extinguishing it on the Shabbat day, special care must be taken to ensure that the kindling of the lights on Shabbat eve will not lead to kindling or extinguishing fire once Shabbat begins.

Here, too, there is no single theme that unites all the topics addressed, although most of them deal with food preparation on Shabbat. Arranging the chapter's contents in a different order than is presented in the Mishna would allow us to identify several general questions that serve as the basis for the details that are discussed in this chapter. ", 
                "One of these issues relates to the laws of squeezing on Shabbat. Squeezing is not listed as a primary category of prohibited labor. Its prohibition is not based on the act of squeezing alone; indeed, squeezing can be a subcategory of at least two primary categories of labor, depending on the circumstances: It can be a subcategory of the labor of threshing, which is defined abstractly as removing the desired contents from within an unwanted wrapping or shell, and it can be a subcategory of the labor of whitening, when the squeezing is performed in the process of washing. ", 
                "However, the relationship between squeezing and threshing is not completely clear and uniform. For example, in the practical discussions regarding milking animals on Shabbat, the question arises as to the extent to which one should understand milking as a form or subcategory of squeezing or threshing. This leads to the question of whether milking should be viewed as a Torah prohibition or a rabbinic decree. Similarly, it is necessary to delineate the fine differences between types of squeezing that can be viewed as a subcategory of threshing and other types of squeezing that are externally similar to the first type but differ with regard to the intent of the person squeezing or the purpose of the act itself. ", 
                "Also discussed in this chapter is breaking a barrel in order to remove food from inside it. The chapter likewise deals with various kinds of food preparation. These forms of food preparation all involve actions that are similar to squeezing and require one to identify the fine line separating a prohibited labor from actions that are externally similar to it but are different because of the intent of the person performing the action. Examples of this include heating up, soaking, and cooling foods on Shabbat: Are these acts forbidden because of their similarity to cooking, or are they perhaps totally permitted and not prohibited even by rabbinic decree? This chapter also comes to conclusions regarding some issues that the Gemara began to address in previous chapters but had not yet resolved. "

                "The <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of items that are set aside from use on Shabbat, as explained in this chapter, are unique in that earlier generations at the beginning of the Second Temple era were especially stringent with regard to these laws and forbade handling practically all utensils. Over the course of time, as the Sages saw that the nation as a whole was more meticulous in observing Shabbat, they became progressively more lenient with regard to this prohibition. ", 
                "In the final halakhic conclusions in these matters, the lenient opinions of Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Yosei were accepted. In their view, items that are set-aside [<span class=\"it-text\">muktze</span>] because of monetary loss are entirely forbidden from being handled, while utensils whose function is prohibited on Shabbat may be handled in order to use them for a permitted purpose or if one needs the place on which they are located. Items that are repulsive are not prohibited to be handled. ", 
                "Nonetheless, there are still several aspects of this area of <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> for which no leniencies apply. According to all opinions, anything that does not have the status of a utensil, such as raw materials and money, is set-aside. Additionally, according to most opinions, any item that was set aside at the beginning of Shabbat remains set-aside for the duration of Shabbat. It should also be emphasized that the decision to be lenient with the laws pertaining to items that are set-aside applies specifically to Shabbat. On Festivals, the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> follows the stringent view with regard to this prohibition. This is based upon the assumption that the sanctity of Shabbat had been internalized by the nation to the point that it did not need further strengthening and safeguarding. Concerning the Festivals, however, since certain prohibited labors are permitted for the sake of food preparation, it was necessary to impose additional decrees and safeguards in order to ensure that the sanctity of the Festivals would not be disregarded.

Its main conclusions were as follows: It is prohibited to squeeze an item if one's main intent in doing so is to make use of the liquid that emerges. At times this may constitute a Torah prohibition, while at other times it constitutes a rabbinic one. On the other hand, if one's intent is to improve the food item by squeezing liquid from it, even though the action is the same as in the case outlined previously, the act is not defined as a prohibited labor and is permitted according to Torah law. Nonetheless, in certain cases the Sages prohibited squeezing as a precautionary measure in order to ensure that one not perform a prohibited labor. ",

Thus, one may add hot water to improve a food unless it is otherwise inedible or the hot water changes the food into a completely different item. ", 
                "The Gemara arrived at similar conclusions regarding breaking a barrel in order to eat the food that is inside: It all depends upon the extent to which the action improves the barrel. If the act improves the barrel, then breaking it is prohibited, whereas if it causes significant damage to the barrel and only slight improvement, it is permitted even <span class=\"it-text\">ab initio</span>. Additionally, if one's primary intent is to remove the food rather than to improve the receptacle, breaking the barrel is permitted. ",

Similarly, when there is a need to move something connected to a set-aside item, such as a child who is holding a set-aside item, or a barrel upon which a set-aside item is resting, the Sages allowed it and did not apply the prohibition of a base for a forbidden article. It was also explained in this chapter that the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> is generally not highly stringent with regard to the laws of set-aside on Shabbat, and it is permitted to move something in order to protect the honor of Shabbat or to remove an item that people find repulsive.

On the other hand, Beit Hillel, whose opinion in this case is the accepted <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>, are of the opinion that the prohibitions of Shabbat apply to the person and not to the utensils with which the labor is performed.

Until this point, two aspects of carrying out were distinguished: Carrying out an object from one domain to another, and transporting an object more than four cubits in the public domain. In this chapter, an additional group of <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> is discussed: The laws of throwing and extending an object from one domain to another via an intervening domain.",

While transporting an object is an action that is continuous over a period of time, throwing is one instantaneous act.

                "To understand these labors, it is first necessary to clarify what constitutes a knot. What are the types of knots that the Torah prohibited one to tie or untie on Shabbat? Several traditions were received by the Sages on this matter. They too require analysis and additional clarification.", 
                "There is a fundamental principle that one is liable for tying or untying only a permanent knot, i.e., a knot designed to endure. This requirement precludes knots made to be immediately undone as well as knots meant to be undone in the near future. The definition of permanence as it pertains to a knot requires further clarification. Does permanence relate to the function of the knot, the method by which the knot was tied, or both? If permanence relates only to the method of tying, it is only necessary to ascertain if a knot was tied in such a manner that it can endure for a long period of time. If so, the person who tied the knot is liable for his action, even if he intended for the knot to be temporary and planned to immediately untie it.",

Consideration is given to both knots tied in a common, simple manner and knots tied with utensils or parts of vessels, such as the knots of shoes, sandals, and the like. The central theme of this chapter is the qualifications of a knot for the purposes of both Torah law and rabbinic decree.",

There are activities whose performance involves no Torah prohibition whatsoever, or at the most involves a minor risk of violating a rabbinic prohibition; however, the Sages prohibited them in cases in which their performance on Shabbat constitutes preparation for the weekdays. It is considered irreverent to prepare for the weekdays on the supremely holy day of Shabbat. This broad general principle requires elaboration: Which activities are permitted within this framework, and which preparatory activities remain prohibited?

It was therefore necessary to provide mnemonic devices and other helpful tools to facilitate the memorization of the study material, and these methods are frequently integrated into the text of the Mishna and the Talmud.",

Unlike other categories of labor, there is an interval between the action and the desired result. It is a process, and therefore the question arises: At what stage in the process can it be said that an act of cooking has been performed? Shall we say that one who undertakes any action in the course of the entire process is considered to have engaged in that prohibited labor? Or perhaps, that is the case only with regard to one who initiates the process? Moreover, since the cooking process, once initiated, continues without the need for any additional action by the one cooking, the question can be raised: Is the mere act of placing an item on the fire defined as labor, or is it considered an incomplete segment of that labor?", 
                "There is a question as to whether the essence of the labor of cooking is transforming inedible into edible, unusable into usable, or whether it is the act of cooking that is prohibited, independent of the result. In practical terms, is it prohibited to further cook a cooked item?", 
                "The fundamental definition of cooking requires clarification and precision. In a very general sense, one could posit that cooking or baking are activities that render substances fit for use by means of heat. However, that leaves open the question of whether any activity that renders a substance usable is considered cooking, or perhaps, the essence of cooking is merely the softening or hardening of that substance?", 
                "It is also important to clarify whether the prohibited labor of cooking applies to all substances, or perhaps only to food, or perhaps only to specific types of food. Another related question is whether the halakhic definition of cooking depends upon some specific level of heat, e.g., the boiling point, or the intensity of the heat, or perhaps its effect is of no significance. Additionally, it must be ascertained whether the definition of cooking is restricted to the use of fire or whether it extends to other sources of heat. Similarly, is there a distinction between natural sources of heat and artificial ones in this context?",

This decree is generally explained as a protective measure to prevent writing on Shabbat, as commercial activity generally requires writing in order to record and approve legally binding transactions. Although Torah law does not prohibit commercial activity itself on Shabbat, commercial transactions often entail numerous activities that are prohibited on Shabbat, such as carrying objects from one domain to another, fixing utensils or completing their production, and handling objects that may not be handled on Shabbat.

In addition to prohibiting direct and explicitly formulated business transactions, the decree also encompasses related activities, such as hiring workers and granting or receiving a loan. However, since the source of this prohibition is rabbinic, there are instances where there is room for leniency, such as when the commercial activity is for the sake of a mitzva or when there is no concern for possible violation of Shabbat.

On the one hand is the extent to which we consider the value of the act itself from the perspective of significant measures, and on the other hand is the extent to which a person's intentions determine whether there is cause to be strict or lenient with him. With regard to minimum measures, the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> is strict. If an amount less than the minimum measure is significant to a particular person, that person may not carry out this lesser quantity. However, when defining a completed labor, the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> is lenient.

Even with reference to carrying an object contained in a vessel or utensil, personal intentions are so crucial that a person carrying out an object in a vessel is liable only for the item one intended to transport.",

The general principle was established that it is impossible to consider labor done by more than one person a biblical violation, so long as no one person was the dominant participant in the labor. There is no liability for labor done partially or jointly, unless that is the manner in which the labor is customarily performed.",

Not every item that a person wears on his body is clothing per se, and not every garment is typically worn. In a certain sense an ornament is like clothing; however, what items fall under the rubric of ornament? Are there objective criteria that determine whether or not an item is an ornament, or perhaps that determination is totally dependent on the individual taste of the one who places the ornament on his person? Furthermore, there are different items that one might bear on his body, e.g., bandages, prosthetic limbs, and other medical equipment, including amulets, which are neither ornaments nor clothing.

This leniency stems from the fact that business activity is not inherently prohibited on Shabbat, but rather is forbidden by rabbinic decree. We do not add to rabbinic decrees with additional layers of safeguards meant to distance people from violation.

However, with regard to creeping animals, it was determined that one is liable for wounding on Shabbat only those eight creeping animals that are enumerated in the Bible with reference to the laws of impurity. One is not liable for wounding other creeping animals because there is no evidence that their skin is considered halakhic skin. Therefore, one who inflicts a wound upon them is liable only when blood actually flows from the body of the creature; internal bleeding is not considered a bruise from a legal perspective. ",

The rule was explained as follows: Any substance which is normally ingested for non-medicinal purposes can be consumed by a sick person for curative purposes. However, medical procedures a healthy person would not normally perform are prohibited on Shabbat because it is apparent to all that the procedure is medical. In that case, a sick person may only perform the procedure in an unusual and distinctive manner, not in the manner in which it is customarily practiced as a medicine. Of course, in any life-threatening situation, it is permitted to perform even primary categories of prohibited labor. "

Some of these issues have already been addressed in earlier chapters, and Chapter Five was devoted to clarifying the laws of transporting items that are on an animal from one domain to another on Shabbat. This chapter addresses a more limited and specific issue, namely, the details of the prohibition of driving a laden animal on Shabbat. For example, what is the source of the prohibition? The Gemara considers whether the Torah expressly forbids driving a laden animal, whether the prohibition stems from a rabbinic decree not to make use of animals, or whether it is derived from the positive command to allow animals to rest. Similarly, the chapter examines the severity and scope of this prohibition. ",

An item considered fit to store is one that people generally store and one whose measure is large enough to make it worthwhile to store for future use.

This definition necessitates the making of various distinctions pertaining to the laws of wounding on Shabbat.

Such preparation involves the prohibited labors of grinding and crushing, as well as other Torah prohibitions. Due to this concern, various medical treatments, even many that do not involve the ingestion of medicine, were prohibited. Thus, this chapter specifies and defines various healing procedures.

However, one aspect is fundamental and central: Abstention from creative labor. The only way to achieve a proper grasp of Shabbat and its <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span>, ranging from Torah statutes to rabbinic ordinances and decrees issued throughout the generations, is by means of gaining an understanding of this fundamental principle.", 
                "The mitzva to abstain from labor and the prohibition to perform labor on Shabbat are both closely tied to the biblical depiction of the creation of the world and God's own abstention from work on the seventh day. The Shabbat of the Jewish people is, in a sense, an extension and emulation of the Shabbat of the Holy One, Blessed be He, from which our Shabbat draws its spiritual foundations. On the seventh day, God abstained “from all His work that God in creating had made.” In the Torah, the Jewish people were explicitly commanded to abstain from engaging in the construction of the Tabernacle on Shabbat.", 
                "There are two equally fundamental aspects to these activities that are essential to the comprehension of the concept of labor prohibited on Shabbat: They are both creative acts of tangible labor and work done with prior intent. These two fundamental principles are captured in the following halakhic terminology: Planned, thoughtful, creative labor was prohibited by the Torah,<sup>3</sup> and: For all destructive acts, one is exempt.<sup>4</sup> The exceptions to the latter principle are those actions that are destructive in the short term, but in the long term are actually preparations for constructive acts that will follow.", 
                "Labor on Shabbat is defined in this manner because of the aforementioned comparison between our Shabbat and God's Shabbat at the end of the creation of the universe. The degree of physical exertion expended to perform a particular action is not taken into consideration, nor does it matter whether or not the action produces results or brings profit to the worker, or whether it serves as the means of one's livelihood. It is for this reason that even activities in which the amount of energy expended is minimal and which serve only for enjoyment, e.g., writing or kindling a fire, are prohibited by the Torah and constitute labor, i.e., creating a tangible result with prior intent.", 
                "Most of the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of Shabbat, which are comprised of thirty-nine primary categories of prohibited labor and their subcategories, are the elaboration and detailed enumeration of these major principles in the definition of the various types of creative labor and the establishment of their parameters and limits. The ordinances and safeguards instituted by the Sages of blessed memory merely strengthen and reinforce the proper observance of the Shabbat in practical terms. They determine how to refrain from prohibited labor and from any action that could potentially lead to performance of a prohibited labor.", 
                "Among the thirty-nine primary categories of labor enumerated with regard to Shabbat, there is only one that is anomalous, and its explication occupies a most significant place in the tractate of <span class=\"it-text\">Shabbat</span>: Carrying out an object from one domain to another. According to Torah law, it is prohibited to carry any object on Shabbat from the domain in which it is located to another domain. There is no element of physical exertion or toil involved in this labor, as one is liable even for carrying out minuscule objects. On the other hand, carrying out cannot be included in the category of truly creative labors either. In truth, this labor is in a category of its own, a distinct Torah law that underscores the nature of rest on Shabbat. ", 
                "The term <span class=\"it-text\">shabbaton</span> means cessation of the creative activities that characterize the six active days of the week. <span class=\"it-text\">Shabbaton</span> also means silence, rest, cessation of the motility and hustle-bustle of the weekdays, cessation of the connection between the private domain of the individual and the public domain, and the transformation of the public domain into an environment of quiescence and tranquility. So that the tranquility of Shabbat will be complete, the parameters of these realms are delineated in a manner unique to Shabbat, unlike the definition of public and private domains in other areas of <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>, i.e., property law and the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of ritual impurity. It is both prohibited to carry objects from one domain to another and to carry objects within the confines of the public domain.",

                "Although the essence of Shabbat lies in the observance of its restfulness, which is manifested in the prohibitions against creative labor and carrying out from one domain to another, there are also positive commandments involved in the observance of Shabbat, beyond the mitzva to sacrifice additional offerings in the Temple. These positive commandments are alluded to in the verse: “Remember the day of Shabbat to keep it holy.”<sup>5</sup> The practical fulfillment of this mitzva is multifaceted. It begins with the essential commandment of <span class=\"it-text\">kiddush</span>, sanctification of Shabbat over a cup of wine, along with the special liturgy and customs unique to Shabbat; and it extends to the reference to each weekday in terms of its relative distance from Shabbat. This mitzva also includes the ordinance of taking delight in Shabbat, consistent with the words of the prophet Isaiah. This is accomplished by the enjoyment that is added to the Shabbat meal, the kindling of the Shabbat lights, and all means of celebration that do not conflict with the basic tenets of Shabbat observance.", 
                "According to the oral tradition transmitted through the generations, an entire framework of ordinances and safeguards, categorized under the rubric of <span class=\"it-text\">shevut</span>, was instituted in the days of the earliest Prophets to ensure proper Shabbat observance. Included in this framework is the decree against engaging in commerce on Shabbat, already mentioned in the Bible. The institution of additional Shabbat domains originated long ago, along with the designation of additional areas in which the movement and transfer of objects is prohibited. The details of these ordinances are specified in the tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Eruvin</span>.",

The Sages also prohibited typical weekday activities, as it is inappropriate to engage in them on this sacred day. Therefore, tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Shabbat</span> is distinctive in its terminology.

Do we assess the action in terms of the essence of what is being carried, i.e., the object in the vessel, or is the vessel itself also of import? For example, how do we assess the action if the vessel contains a measure of the object that is less than the minimum amount required for the person to be judged liable for carrying? To give another example, how do we assess the action if the vessel itself has been only partially removed from its domain, but the entire contents of the vessel are already in the other domain? Do we determine liability based on the container or based on the object contained?", 
                "The following question arises frequently with regard to the primary category of carrying out, but it is also relevant to other categories of creative labor: What is the rule for labor done by more than one person? Do we consider all those involved in the labor equally liable, are only some of them liable, or are they all perhaps exempt from punishment?",

Therefore, the Sages permitted making use of animals in cases of significant need, such as in order to avoid a financial loss, provided one does so differently than usual.

Until this chapter, the Gemara primarily addressed the laws of utensils that have been set aside from Shabbat use, whereas this chapter addressed the quite different laws of raw materials and other items that are not utensils. Since utensils by definition are made to be used, it is necessary to decide explicitly or implicitly not to use them in order to remove them from the category of items designated for use on Shabbat. In contrast, raw materials are not inherently considered ready for use, and one must explicitly designate them for use to ensure that they are not set-aside [<span class=\"it-text\">muktze</span>]. In this chapter, we saw how the Sages acted with regard to this issue and how they determined which items are permitted or forbidden to be handled. ", 
                "The Gemara also established guidelines with regard to the application of the laws of <span class=\"it-text\">muktze</span> to the care of animals on Shabbat. When an animal is likely to suffer pain due to a prohibition of rabbinic origin, that prohibition is overridden in order to care for the animal, as cruelty to animals is itself a Torah prohibition. In this area, loss of money to the animal's owner is not a significant factor. ", 
                "Finally, this chapter discussed the permissible methods of attending to the sick on Shabbat. First it addressed the case of a woman after childbirth, and then it proceeded to address the laws of treating people with other ailments. The <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> distinguishes between different levels of illness. Whenever there is a danger to life, no distinction is made between Torah law and rabbinic law; it is permitted to do whatever is necessary to save a person's life. However, the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> is somewhat more stringent when there is only a concern for possible danger, or when the patient feels that his life is in danger but the expert doctors testify otherwise. ", 
                "It is important to note that the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> also takes into account the patient's feelings. The Sages were concerned that the patient's anxiety could cause his condition to deteriorate and become life-threatening. They therefore permitted preparing things for a patient in order to calm him, and under certain conditions they even permitted the performance of labors prohibited by Torah law. ", 
                "The Sages agreed in this chapter that a newborn and a woman after childbirth are included in the category of the dangerously ill for the first few days after birth. Any medical attention they need immediately after childbirth is considered to be a medical procedure undertaken in order to save a life, and those caring for them may take all necessary measures without concern for any prohibitions that would otherwise apply.

One topic continues the discussion of some of the laws of items that have been set aside from Shabbat use; see Chapter Seventeen for the major principles. The second topic addresses caring for and handling animals on Shabbat. The third topic examines the situation of a woman who has given birth on Shabbat, and caring for her in ways that could constitute prohibited labors. These <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> do not seem to be related, but they are all included in the category of <span class=\"it-text\">shevut</span>, prohibitions that are not from the Torah like the categories of prohibited labor, but which were instituted by the Sages on Shabbat and the Festivals in order to prevent the violation of Torah prohibitions or to enhance the sanctity of the day. ", 
                "There are <span class=\"it-text\">shevut</span> decrees that apply to many different areas, and this chapter addresses only some of them. However, we can derive from these examples the scope of <span class=\"it-text\">shevut</span> restrictions in many areas, remembering that each one is based upon rabbinic decree. ", 
                "The <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> discussed in this chapter are further related. Since the Sages themselves instituted these prohibitions as protective measures to prevent violation of Torah law, they could also be lenient in certain cases. This is possible only with regard to rabbinic decrees, but not with regard to prohibitions that stem from Torah law; as the Sages expressed it: They said [it is prohibited] and they said [it is permitted in particular circumstances]. For example, in cases of significant need, such as for the honor of guests or to facilitate Torah study, the Sages permitted several actions that would otherwise have been prohibited due to <span class=\"it-text\">muktze</span>. Such leniencies also exist with regard to other <span class=\"it-text\">shevut</span> restrictions, such as caring for animals on Shabbat. Although there are restrictions due to several relevant rabbinic decrees and concerns, since these are not Torah prohibitions, the Sages were lenient when necessary in order to prevent significant monetary loss or to prevent animals from experiencing pain. ", 
                "After addressing the permitted methods of caring for birthing animals on Shabbat, the chapter discusses how to care for a woman who gives birth on Shabbat. Here the Gemara even addresses activities that are prohibited by Torah law as well as those prohibited by rabbinic decree, as both are permitted in order to save a life. The <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> is very lenient in such cases, to the point that it is permissible to perform any prohibited labor in the event of even a small concern for danger to human life."

                "In the course of discussing the labor category of tying, the opinions and arguments of several <span class=\"it-text\">tanna'im</span> were elucidated. For halakhic purposes, it was concluded that there are two components necessary for an act to constitute the labor of tying. First, the resulting knot must be one which requires the skill of a craftsman, i.e., a permanent knot, which is produced in a manner which will, in the normal course of events, endure and not easily be undone. For this reason, a necktie is not a type of knot. Second, the knot must be tied with the intention that it endure in its place and not be undone. A knot which is initially tied in order to be untied daily or at short intervals is not included in this category. ", 
                "On the basis of these fundamental principles, it was possible to define which activities constitute the tying prohibited by the Torah. What remains to be determined is the nature of those knots which one is permitted to tie on Shabbat <span class=\"it-text\">ab initio</span>. This matter is clarified in commentaries and by halakhic authorities.", 
                "The second topic of this chapter is preparation. It was determined that it is prohibited to prepare for a mundane day on a sacred day, such as preparation for a weekday on Shabbat. It is even prohibited to prepare on a day of greater sanctity for a day of lesser sanctity, e.g., preparing on Shabbat for Yom Kippur.", 
                "It was also clarified that preparatory activities necessary for Shabbat can be performed on Shabbat, even if the products of these activities were not actually used on Shabbat. It is prohibited to perform only activities that one explicitly knows at the time are not at all necessary for that Shabbat. It must be understood that the above principle does not pertain to labor, which is in and of itself prohibited on Shabbat. Activities that constitute labor are permitted on Shabbat only in life-threatening situations. The Gemara's discussion of preparation only referenced activities which, in and of themselves, are permitted on Shabbat. These activities were prohibited to give Shabbat its due reverence, because they are mundane activities [<span class=\"it-text\">uvdin dehol</span>]. "

                "The main question addressed by the Sages in this chapter was: What is the relationship between the text of the Written Torah and the specific laws of carrying out? This question was answered definitively: An explicit Torah source could not be found for the details of the laws that comprise accepted halakhic practice; nor was it possible to directly infer these details from a biblical verse. In actuality, all of the fundamentals of the Shabbat prohibitions were transmitted orally to Moses from Sinai. Notwithstanding this conclusion, the manner in which the Tabernacle activities were performed serves as a model for the laws of Shabbat prohibitions. All of the detailed laws of the labor categories on Shabbat, particularly those of carrying out, are specified and assessed against this standard.", 
                "In this chapter, the particular laws of throwing and extending were clarified, and other aspects of the prohibition of carrying out were summarized. Biblical prohibitions such as transporting from the public domain to the private domain were discussed, as were particular laws instituted by the Sages as safeguards. These safeguards include the laws of the intermediate domain known as <span class=\"it-text\">karmelit</span>, carrying through a puddle of water, and the laws pertaining to water in a boat and between boats. These prohibitions do not appear in the Written Torah; rather, they were instituted by the Sages, who assigned them parameters corresponding to those of the biblical prohibitions. ", 
                "This chapter also discussed the significance of a person's intent at the time he begins performing a labor. This determines whether one would be liable for the acts of carrying out or throwing.

                "This chapter deals primarily with two somewhat interrelated topics: The laws of upright boards surrounding a well and the matter of an enclosure [<span class=\"it-text\">karpef </span>] that is for storage and not for residence.", 
                "Continuing the discussion of the special leniencies cited in the first chapter with regard to establishing an <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> for those in transit in a caravan, this chapter discusses the halakhic ruling with regard to the establishment of upright boards around a well. This involves a well that is ten cubits deep, which is a private domain that is located in the public domain. The well is surrounded with a virtual partition comprised of two boards forming a right angle at each corner of the well, with additional individual boards situated between the corners if a larger partition is necessary. The Sages declared that a partition of this sort renders the area surrounding the well a private domain, enabling one to draw water from the well on Shabbat and to give his animals water to drink. ", 
                "In the course of the discussion of the halakhic validity of upright boards surrounding a well and their utilization, a related problem arises: Under what circumstances and to what extent is it permitted to move objects in areas that are not the residence of an individual, although they are surrounded by a partition that would accord them the legal status of objects in a private domain? The dilemma is: Are enclosures or yards considered private domains in every sense? Or, although it is prohibited to carry objects between them and the public domain, perhaps since those areas were not designated as residences, they are not full-fledged private domains to the extent that it is permitted to carry there? Although, by Torah law, partitions create a private domain, the Sages prohibited carrying within private domains that are similar to public domains. Therefore, here too the question arises: At which point do these enclosures cease to be full-fledged private domains and assume the legal status of an intermediate domain [<span class=\"it-text\">karmelit</span>], in which carrying is prohibited by rabbinic law? Clarification of the details and parameters of these fundamental issues constitute the primary focus of this chapter."

                "In this chapter, several of the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> were discussed, primarily the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of the joining of Shabbat boundaries. The issues raised were divided into distinct units that are related as far as preparation of the <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> is concerned, not necessarily in terms of their intrinsic principles. With regard to the question of what may be used to establish an <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span>, the conclusion was that any item considered food in an amount sufficient for two meals, or alternatively any ingredient used in the consumption of two meals, e.g., spices, is suitable. This food must be suitable for human consumption, but there is no stipulation demanding that the one who placed the <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> must actually be able to eat it. Even if for some reason he cannot, the <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> is valid. However, neither water nor salt may be used for the <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> since these are not considered food.", 
                "A second problem discussed with regard to the joining of Shabbat boundaries was: Who may establish the <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span>? The conclusion was that the one placing the <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> must be of sound mind and acknowledge the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span>in. If he is not of sound mind, then he can only serve as an instrument for transferring the <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span>; however, he cannot serve as an emissary in placing the <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span>.", 
                "With regard to the joining of boundaries, it was stated that the person placing the <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> must do so in a location where he has access to it, enabling him to take the food the moment the <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> takes effect, during twilight on Shabbat eve. Therefore, one may not place the <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> in a place from where it would be prohibited to take it on Shabbat. For example, if one places the food outside the domain where he establishes residence on Shabbat, or if he were to place it in a location that it is prohibited for him to enter, the <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> would be invalidated. ", 
                "Uncertainties arose due to the various restrictions that apply to the placement of the <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span>. Is the <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> valid in a case where it is unclear whether the <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> remained in place or was moved? Is it valid if it is not known whether the <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> was eaten, destroyed, or became ritually impure, rendering it no longer fit for human consumption prior to the time when the <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> took effect? In general, the resolution of those dilemmas was based on the ruling by the Sages: An <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> whose validity is uncertain is nevertheless valid, since in principle the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> are by rabbinic law.", 
                "The principle that one rules leniently in cases of <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> since the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> are by rabbinic law resolved a different problem, which is the question of a conditional <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span>. An example is the case of an individual who seeks to establish residence not in one specific location, but rather places an <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> in each of two different locations, stipulating that only later, on Shabbat, will he decide on which of the two he will rely. The dilemma that arises is whether or not one can rely on an indefinite <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span>. The halakhic conclusion was that even according to those who hold that there is no retroactive designation, i.e., the direction that one ultimately chooses was retroactively the direction that he originally intended, the <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> is nevertheless valid. Since the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> is by rabbinic law, the ruling is lenient and it is permitted to place a conditional <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span>. "

Tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Shabbat</span> opened with a discussion of the prohibited labor of carrying out on Shabbat. Tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Eiruvin</span> analyzes the details of the rabbinic laws that apply to this act. This prohibited labor is unique in that it is not an inherently creative act; rather, it is merely the act of transferring an object from one domain to another. ", 
                "In essence, the labor of carrying out highlights the significance of Shabbat as a day of rest, not only a day during which specific activities are prohibited, but also a day on which a premium is placed on quiet, rest, and a sense of relaxation. Shabbat demands that one take a break from the everyday hustle and bustle of moving and carrying from the public to the private domain and vice versa. Similarly, the public thoroughfare calms down from its weekday business and trade. This is accomplished by the creation of domains that are unique to Shabbat. That is, they do not correspond to the domains in force with regard to the rules of commerce, nor those of ritual purity. Transference between different domains is forbidden, as is carrying in the public domain.",

                "The private domain is an area of four handbreadths by four handbreadths; a handbreadth is the distance from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the little finger, or slightly more. A private domain is separated from the area around it by walls that are at least ten handbreadths high. In terms of the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of Shabbat, an area is a private domain even if it is open to the public and available for use.", 
                "The public domain is a thoroughfare at least sixteen cubits wide; a cubit is the distance from the elbow to the end of the index finger. According to some opinions, for an area to be defined as a public domain it must also be frequented by more than 600,000 people daily. The <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of the public domain apply only up to a height of ten handbreadths.", 
                "According to Torah law, these are the two primary domains. The Sages added a third, the <span class=\"it-text\">karmelit,</span> whose legal status by rabbinic law is that of a public domain. The <span class=\"it-text\">karmelit</span> is at least four handbreadths by four handbreadths and not surrounded by walls. Examples of this domain are fields, lakes, etc. ", 
                "An exempt domain is an area of less than four handbreadths by four handbreadths. In addition, the airspace above ten handbreadths in a public domain or a <span class=\"it-text\">karmelit</span> is an exempt domain, where the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of carrying do not apply.", 
                "For many years, these domains constituted the only restrictions with regard to carrying out and movement on Shabbat. After the Jewish people settled and began to develop their land, the rabbinic leadership grew concerned that in the course of mundane living in towns and villages, Shabbat was not accorded its due. In particular, the distinctions between the domains of Shabbat were obfuscated; their theoretical parameters did not correspond to the actual utilization of those areas, and the domains and their <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot </span>were interchanged. After all, a private domain full of people and activity could appear, at least superficially, indistinguishable from a public domain. Moreover, people were able to engage in most of their typical weekday activities without actually violating any of the Torah prohibitions. Consequently, the idea of Shabbat as a day of rest was not realized.", 
                "Already in the First Temple era, the rabbinic Sages began to issue decrees intended to raise the general level of consciousness concerning Shabbat observance. These decrees fall into the category of <span class=\"it-text\">shevut</span>, prohibitions by rabbinic law designed to enhance the character of Shabbat as a day of rest. Such decrees severely limited the permitted uses of the private domains and placed renewed emphasis on the plain meaning of the passage in Exodus that is the source for all of the Shabbat domains: “Let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.” The Sages' decrees limited the designation of private domains to those places that actually belong to an individual and his family. Private domains utilized by more than one individual, e.g., a courtyard shared by several households, as well as the alleyways and paths into which courtyards open, were rendered public domains by rabbinic law. ", 
                "The decrees issued by the Sages are the starting point for tractate<span class=\"it-text\"> Eiruvin</span>. The tractate attempts to arrive at practical solutions for the problems created by these restrictions. The objective is not to abrogate the decrees, but rather to discover alternative methods to underscore the differences between the public and private domains. Similarly, the tractate attempts to discover how one could go beyond the Shabbat limits while maintaining the framework that requires limiting travel on Shabbat. The myriad ordinances that constitute the bulk of tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Eiruvin</span> work within the framework of the established principles of the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot </span>of Shabbat. Within the halakhic framework, there is extensive use of a series of abstract concepts, e.g., domain, limit, partition, and space. Although these principles are often the basis for stringencies and restrictions, they can also serve as the basis for far-reaching leniencies. The two primary concepts analyzed in the framework of tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Eiruvin </span>are the essence of a partition and the essence of a residence.", 
                "The partition is a fundamental component of domains, alleyways, courtyards, houses, and more. Clearly a solid wall with no openings is a partition; however, in most cases the demarcation is less clear-cut. At times, the wall is not sturdy enough to serve as a partition. At times, there are windows, doorways, and other spaces in the wall. At times, the wall does not cover the entire opening. It was therefore necessary to create broader criteria that apply to all forms of partitions, despite their quantitative and qualitative differences: Concepts like <span class=\"it-text\">lavud</span>, which determines that objects less than three handbreadths apart are considered joined; <span class=\"it-text\">gode</span>, through which an incomplete partition can be extended upward or downward; <span class=\"it-text\">havot</span>, through which a cross beam is lowered; and others that broaden the parameters of the concept of partition to include incomplete partitions, e.g., cross beam, side post, form of a doorway, and upright boards. ", 
                "In a similar vein, it must be established what is considered one's fixed residence. Here too, there are clear-cut examples with regard to which there is no uncertainty. One who eats and sleeps and remains in a house that is his alone, certainly has a residence that is exclusively his. However, since reality is a bit more complex, as in practice most people do not live alone and do not spend all their lives in one place. Therefore, it was necessary to create a broader abstract definition of the concept of fixed residence and establish when it is that several people have the legal status of one person, where family relations and dependence unify them, and to what degree one must be tied to or be present at a certain place in order to be considered a resident. Once these definitions are determined, the simplistic distinction between resident and guest is no longer necessarily significant. The concept of one's residence can, on the one hand, be restricted to the individual alone, while on the other hand it can be expanded to include others. Based on the expansive interpretation of the concept of residence, the possibility of establishing the joining of courtyards, the merging of alleyways, and the joining of Shabbat boundaries becomes feasible.", 
                "While some of these solutions might appear to be a disingenuous attempt to circumvent the fundamental<span class=\"it-text\"> halakha</span>, in fact, life in accordance with halakhic principles requires their formulation and definition in an abstract and expansive manner. Especially in the case of <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span>, where the original prohibitions are rabbinic in nature, there is room for far-reaching leniency in implementing these halakhic principles.",

                "Every household must contribute to a jointly owned food item. All the residents of the courtyard assume the legal status of one extended household. This is in fact the <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> for which this tractate is named. ", 
                "A physical change must be made in the alleyway to symbolically demarcate it from the public domain.

If the barrier was properly erected but includes an entrance, whether an actual passageway or merely a window large enough to transfer objects, the residents of the courtyards may opt to establish a single <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> as residents of one courtyard, or to establish a separate <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> in each of the courtyards.

On the one hand, there was a tendency to restrict the application of the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of these upright boards. On the other hand, there was an effort to expand the scope of their validity and applicability. In practice, the leniency that allows placing upright boards around wells is in effect only in the specific circumstance of wells containing spring water. Similarly, the time and place where this leniency is in effect is limited to wells containing spring water located on roads used by pilgrims on their ascent to Jerusalem for the three Festivals. At the same time, the Sages determined that all of the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> that apply to partitions, including all fundamental leniencies, may be applied to upright boards surrounding a well.

Just as the construction of and service in the Tabernacle serve as a paradigm for many of the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of Shabbat, the courtyard of the Tabernacle serves as the prototype from which the measures of all courtyards in the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of Shabbat are ascertained. Through their deliberations, the Sages determined which enclosures or yards are deemed similar to the courtyard of the Tabernacle, in which it is permitted to carry as in a full-fledged private domain, and which are those that exceed two <span class=\"it-text\">beit se'a</span>, which was the area of the Tabernacle, and thus assume a distinct legal status.

Emerging from the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> discussed in this chapter was the fact that the definition of residence in the context of the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> differs from its definition in other areas of <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>. A principle governing the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> is that the legal status of one who does not actually live in a given residence, even if he owns it, is not that of a resident; therefore, his status cannot impinge on the rights of the other residents of the courtyard. Furthermore, one who resides in a residence owned by another is not deemed a full-fledged resident if the owner maintains legal rights providing him access. The owner is deemed the primary resident for the purposes of the <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span>. ", 
                "Similarly, the legal status of a place that serves as a passageway for several residences, e.g., a gatehouse or a balcony, is not that of a residence, and one who resides there is not deemed a resident. ", 
                "While the concept of a residence may be restricted in one sense, it is expanded in the sense that a residence is not merely a place in which one has actual proprietary rights to reside. Any place adjacent to a residence to which tenants have access, and, in the formulation of the Sages, its use is convenient, is considered part of the residence. Based upon this principle, there was a discussion with regard to areas whose use is convenient for the residents of two separate residences or is inconvenient for residents of both.", 
                "As for the use of water on Shabbat, many of the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> are based on the principle: The Sages were lenient with regard to water. The primary reason for this leniency is due to the fact that it is difficult to determine boundaries with regard to water the way that one does with regard to land, as in water the boundaries are not discernible. In addition, water lacks the stability of land, as it is often in motion. Consequently, its passage from one spot is not observable nor is its position constant. Therefore, the Sages were lenient in several areas related to water, e.g., considering a partition suspended above the water's surface as if it extended down below the water's surface, thereby effectively creating partitions within the water and dividing it into distinct domains. Similar ordinances obviating the need for actual partitions in the water were also discussed. ", 
                "With regard to pouring out waste water on Shabbat, it was determined that as long as a person does not pour the water from his domain directly into the public domain, but rather does so indirectly via a pit or a drainage ditch, it is permitted. Although the Sages ruled stringently in most cases involving indirectly carrying out objects on Shabbat, they ruled leniently with regard to water and its usage."

More specifically, it discusses the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> governing alleyways that open into the public domain on one side and are closed on the other three sides by virtue of the partitions of the courtyards and houses located there. Consequently, the public cannot pass through this closed alleyway. An open alleyway, on the other hand, is a small and narrow passageway that is so seldom used that it cannot be considered a public domain, yet, being that it is open on opposite ends, it serves as a passageway from one public domain to another.", 
                "In order to establish an <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> in an alleyway enabling the residents of the alleyway to carry objects there on Shabbat, two actions must be taken: First, every household must contribute to a jointly owned food item. All the residents of the courtyard then assume the legal status of one extended household and it is permitted for them to carry there on Shabbat. This action, the merging of alleyways, is elucidated in later chapters of this tractate. The second action involves modification of the alleyway itself. The purpose of this modification is to clearly demarcate the alleyway as distinct from the public domain. Accordingly, a symbolic fourth partition is placed at the point where the alleyway and the public domain intersect. There are three types of symbolic partitions; they are a cross beam, a side post, and the form of a doorway. A crossbeam is placed over the entrance to the alleyway. A side post is placed adjacent to the wall on the side of the entrance to the alleyway. The form of a doorway consisting of two doorposts and a lintel is considered an effective symbolic partition even in open-ended alleyways. These partitions accentuate the fact that the alleyway is closed to the public.",

The focus of this chapter is, then, to elucidate in detail the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of side posts, cross beams, and forms of doorways, how they are created, their dimensions, and the extent of their legal effect. These clarifications are tied to a more fundamental analysis of the essence of all these partitions: Are they merely symbolic partitions serving as conspicuous markers, or are they actual partitions that meet the minimal requirements of the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>? This leads to another question: What is the legal status of the alleyway in terms of <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> in general, and in terms of the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of Shabbat in particular?

                "Most of the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> related to rendering an alleyway fit for one to carry within it on Shabbat were summarized in this chapter. It is apparent that the accepted halakhic opinion is that an area surrounded by partitions on three of its four sides is a private domain, and therefore an alleyway that is not open-ended is in fact a private domain. However, the Sages instituted a rabbinic ordinance to prevent violation of the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of Shabbat, mandating creation of a divider at the point where the alleyway and the public domain intersect, in order to demarcate between them and prevent one from unintentionally carrying objects out from the alleyway into the public domain. ", 
                "This can be accomplished by means of a cross beam, which, based on the halakhic determination in this chapter, serves merely as a conspicuous marker. A cross beam renders the alleyway fit for one to carry within it only when placed no higher than twenty cubits and no lower than ten handbreadths. Alternatively, this can be accomplished by means of a side post, whose legal status is that of a fourth partition. The result is that an alleyway with a side post is considered closed on four sides. In practice, it was determined that the side post must be attached to the wall of the alleyway and adjacent to the opening of the alleyway <span class=\"it-text\">ab initio</span>. It must be ten handbreadths high and can be of any width, and it must be clear that it is indeed serving as a side post. The Sages deliberated over the question: What form must a side post take in order to make it clear that it is serving that purpose? ", 
                "An even more efficacious method of rendering the fourth side of the alleyway closed from a halakhic perspective is the creation of the form of a doorway. The form of a doorway is effective even in cases where cross beams and side posts are ineffective due to the fact that the openings are higher or wider than the dimensions dictated by <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>. The form of a doorway serves as an actual partition in every sense, and effectively renders even open alleyways permitted for one to carry within them. Although most Sages did not accept the opinion that two parallel partitions alone are sufficient to create a private domain, an open-ended alleyway is not considered a full-fledged public domain either. It is therefore sufficient to close the side where an open-ended alleyway and the public domain intersect with the form of a doorway. Indeed, it was mentioned incidentally in this chapter that it is possible to transform the public domain into a private domain by erecting doors on both open sides and partially close them. ",

Here, the Sages allowed them to erect partitions that would not be considered actual partitions in other circumstances. Similarly, the Sages said that a military encampment at a time of war is exempt from all the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span>, as these <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> were instituted only for those living at home in peace."

Consequently, since he can neither participate in an <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> nor can others include him in their <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span>, in order to establish an <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> in that courtyard, the Jews in the courtyard must rent the gentile's domain for the purposes of the <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span>.

With regard to all rabbinic ordinances and decrees, the question arises: To what extent should application of these preventive measures be expanded in order to prevent one from performing a full-fledged prohibited labor on Shabbat? In what cases is it appropriate to enact preventive measures, and in what cases are they superfluous? Or, under what circumstances are the Sages less than insistent that people abide by these measures? As all these prohibitions are rabbinic ordinances and decrees, a fine line distinguishes the permitted from the prohibited. There is no fixed principle applicable in every case, and these decrees are not Torah decrees with regard to which there can be no flexibility. There were areas in which the Sages were concerned, ruled stringently, and issued decrees, and there were other areas where they ruled leniently and did not issue decrees.",

This is the rationale for the principle: There are no rabbinic decrees in the Temple, which is in effect almost universally. In any event, here too there is a plethora of issues that arise: In what cases did the Sages completely suspend their decree and in what cases were they lenient in applying certain aspects of the decree while maintaining the fundamental prohibition?

From that point, the outskirts of the city begin. Once the borders of the essential city are determined, additional areas are appended to the city on its various sides until it assumes the shape of a rectangle or square. No section of the essential city portion protrudes beyond the city boundaries. It is incorporated into the city, rendering it square. As for the measurement of the Shabbat boundaries of the city, the result is a square two thousand cubits by two thousand cubits.

Consequently, a method of determining when and how those areas are incorporated into the city proper must be adopted, so that its Shabbat limit can be measured from a defined border. In practice, the boundaries of the city must be delineated as straight lines, in order to simplify calculation of the measurement. Only then can the actual measurement of the Shabbat limit of the city begin. ",

The halakhic conclusion was that where the matter is not dependent on the presence or absence of partitions, but rather on the residents and the residence, the latter principle prevails and once carrying is permitted it remains permitted.

The Sages established that one who forfeited his Shabbat limit by venturing beyond that limit may proceed only four cubits, as that is the basic area at the disposal of every person at any time, even if he no longer has the right to the greater Shabbat limit of two thousand cubits. However, this holds true only for one who ventured beyond his Shabbat limit without justification. If there was a justified reason for leaving, e.g., to rescue someone, give testimony, or go to war, one establishes residence and acquires the Shabbat limit at his destination.", 
                "It was also concluded in this chapter that one acquires his Shabbat limit consciously or unconsciously. Indeed, even an individual who was sleeping in a specific location as Shabbat arrives acquires his Shabbat limit at that location, and he may walk two thousand cubits in any direction from there. Similarly, one who was adjacent to a city or some other place in which he desired to acquire residence, even if he did not know precisely where that residence would be, acquires that residence as long as he is near enough to that place that it is permitted to reach it.",

The first method, which is effective regardless of the circumstances, is establishing an <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> with one's feet. One who seeks to establish an <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> can, during the day, go to the place that he seeks to acquire as his residence, and declare: I acquire residence at this location. This is effective even if he then returns home and sleeps there. At times, he acquires residence even without a declaration. This is effective because the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> requiring placement of food in establishing residence was instituted as a leniency enabling one to establish an <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> by means of an agent. ", 
                "An alternative method of joining the boundaries is by declaring that one seeks to establish residence in a specific location, even without being present at that location. However, the Sages allowed the acquisition of residence in this manner, without placing food, only in cases where there is no other alternative. Therefore, this method may be employed by people traveling who must establish Shabbat residence en route. One sitting at home who is able to establish an <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> employing one of the other methods may not acquire residence utilizing this method."

While the location and the boundaries of a residence as well as the manner in which one resides in a residence have already been addressed, some matters remain that require clarification. Once the structure has been classified as a residence, there are additional, adjacent areas beyond the residence proper to which the residents have access and which they have the right to use. Although the residents do not necessarily own the adjacent areas, the question with regard to the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of Shabbat is to what degree the residents have the right to utilize that adjacent area and under what circumstances those rights are revoked, either because the residents were never entitled to make use of that area or because the rights of others take precedence over theirs. ", 
                "In continuation of the discussion concerning what constitutes a residence, an additional question arises: Is every structure in which people reside considered a residence, or are there places that by their very nature are not considered residences as far as the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> are concerned? Examples include places that are not fit for residence, dwellings that belong to others, and uninhabited dwellings whose owners are not present.

                "Two topics are discussed in this chapter. One is placement of the <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span>, food for one meal, which is an inseparable component of the establishment of any <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span>, whether joining of courtyards, merging of alleyways, or joining of Shabbat boundaries. The necessity of contributing food to the <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> is due to the fact that the place where one's food is located is considered his residence. Consequently, inclusion of several people in a common meal creates a form of common ownership of the residence, the precise nature of which is discussed in the Gemara. Placement of one's food in a specific location is, in a sense, tantamount to moving his residence to that location. The Gemara discusses several issues, among them, the types of food that may constitute a meal for the purpose of <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span>. Are there foods that are not suited for an <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span>? In addition, must all those who placed the <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> have access to the food in order for the <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> to be effective?", 
                "Since the issue of the food suitable for placement in an <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> applies both to <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of joining of the courtyards and joining of Shabbat boundaries, the Gemara in Chapter Three proceeds to discuss the latter subject: The <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of joining Shabbat boundaries. The <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> – some say by Torah law while others say by rabbinic law – is that one may not travel more than two thousand cubits outside his place on Shabbat. However, in certain cases the Sages permitted establishing a joining of Shabbat boundaries that allows one to travel a longer distance. This is accomplished by placing food sufficient for two meals in a specific location that is not his place of residence; that location, for all intents and purposes, becomes his residence, and he may travel two thousand cubits from that location. ", 
                "There are many details involved in this universally accepted <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>, and in this chapter the Gemara elucidates how and when one places the food for the <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span>, as well as in what cases the <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> is in effect and when it is invalidated due either to an inappropriate location or a problem with the food item itself. Similarly, the Gemara discusses whether the placement of the <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> is an irreversible and unequivocal decision to reside at that location, or whether it is possible to place the <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> conditionally and to decide in the course of Shabbat when and in which direction the <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> takes effect. These questions with regard to the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of a joining of Shabbat boundaries are elucidated in this chapter and in those that follow."

                "At the end of the sixth chapter, the Gemara discussed several problems involving two adjacent courtyards each utilized by the residents of the other. The fundamental question is whether, under what circumstances, and in what manner they are considered one courtyard rather than two. This inquiry is pursued from a different perspective in this chapter, specifically with regard to determining the status of the area between the courtyards. The Gemara analyzes the requisite conditions for a partition between two courtyards to be considered as a barrier that separates them, as opposed to the circumstances under which the partition is considered nonexistent. In general, what types of partitions effectively divide courtyards? ", 
                "There are, of course, some unambiguous cases, e.g., a tall, sealed partition between two domains, which is a clear, conspicuous barrier, or, in contrast, a flimsy, easily dismantled partition. However, there are many intermediate cases, each of which requires elucidation and analysis. Under what circumstances is the partition negated despite the fact that its remnants, or some indication that there was a partition, are still extant? What is the ruling of an intact partition that enables passage between the courtyards via an entrance, a window, or a ladder? Does an entrance of this kind negate the barrier, rendering the two courtyards a single unit in every sense, or do they retain the status of two courtyards? ", 
                "These clarifications relate mainly to courtyards and houses for which an <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> was established; however, it is also necessary to analyze the details of the practical factors of the merging of courtyards that open into a common alleyway. How is the placement of the meal common to the residents of the courtyards, which, for all intents and purposes, is the essence of the <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span>, accomplished? This question refers both to the amount of food as well as the type of food required. Another issue is the manner in which an <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> is acquired. Must it always be acquired in the same manner, with each partner to the <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> contributing a certain amount of actual food, after which all the food is collected as a shared meal, or are there ways to simplify the process, by allowing for partial funding of the meal, or by appointing an agent to acquire it on one's behalf?

Essentially, what are the limits of rabbinic decrees? Under what circumstances do the Sages insist on full compliance and when are they more flexible? The prohibited labor of carrying out is an inferior labor, as, in contrast to the other primary categories of prohibited labor, no apparent change has been engendered in the object, and the lines demarcating the boundaries between the various domains of Shabbat are similarly not always apparent. Consequently, numerous rabbinic decrees were issued in an attempt to limit the possibility that one will transfer objects from one domain to another. The Sages prohibited transfer of objects from domain to domain even when it is accomplished through an intermediate domain, unless it was performed while observing numerous precautionary measures.", 
                "Indeed, the principle established by Rabbi Shimon was, in a certain sense, the key to all of the halakhic issues discussed in this chapter; it applied to the rabbinic decrees issued to preserve the character of Shabbat as a day of rest: Wherever the Sages permitted you to perform a certain action, they merely gave you from that which was yours. As it was the Sages who issued these decrees, they, at times, permitted the performance of actions similar to those they prohibited for various reasons.", 
                "Therefore, the Sages employed extensive leniency with regard to matters associated with sacred items, e.g., sacred writings, phylacteries, and the like. This approach was especially conspicuous with regard to the Temple precincts. There, many of the decrees issued by the Sages were not in effect, either due to the diligence of the priests and their meticulousness in the performance of mitzvot, in contrast to the general public, whose lack of attention could lead to failure in those matters, or due to the fact that stringency within the Temple precincts with regard to one matter could lead to laxity with regard to other mitzvot of the Temple that are Torah obligations.", 
                "Nevertheless, not everything permitted by Torah law was actually performed within the Temple precincts. The suspension of decrees was implemented only for matters that were essential and with regard to which there was no danger that a Torah prohibition would be violated. Just as the Sages were lenient in applying decrees issued to preserve Shabbat as a day of rest within the Temple precincts, so too were they lenient with regard to other rabbinic decrees and stringencies there, limiting their decrees only to cases where there was concern lest even the priests in the Temple come to violate a Torah prohibition."

                "It has been established that the residents of a courtyard must establish an <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> if they wish to carry vessels from their houses into the courtyard on Shabbat. It has similarly been established that if one of the courtyard residents neglected to participate in the <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span>, it is prohibited for all residents of the courtyard to carry throughout the courtyard. This leads to a question of both fundamental and practical import: What is the definition of a residence in this respect? Who is classified as a resident of the courtyard or suited to be considered as living there? Is the legal status of everyone located in the courtyard, regardless of age, gender, or legal standing, that of a resident, prohibiting the residents of the courtyard from carrying in the courtyard if he fails to participate in the <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span>? Perhaps there are situations where one living in a courtyard e.g., a family member or visitor, is not considered a resident with regard to <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span>, as he is subordinate to others. The converse case must also be considered. What is the status of one whose permanent place of residence is in the courtyard, but that person is temporarily living elsewhere? Is he considered to be a resident despite his absence or not? There is also the fundamental issue of a gentile living in the courtyard; is he too considered a resident with regard to the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> in terms of prohibiting the other residents from carrying if he does not participate in the <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span>? If so, can he establish an <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span>, or does this ordinance apply only to Jews? ", 
                "The Gemara also discusses a different aspect of the definition of residency: Can a person who lives in a courtyard legally relinquish his rights in the courtyard or transfer his rights to others, so that he is no longer considered a resident who prohibits the other occupants from carrying? If that is indeed an option, how is it to be achieved? Must he completely renounce all rights and ownership in the courtyard, or is a partial renunciation sufficient? With regard to one who rents his house to another, at what point do his legal rights to the house cease? Is this similar to standard renunciation of one's property or not? ",

                "In addition to this fundamental question, the Gemara addresses a series of ancillary problems with regard to the relationship between the right to use a courtyard and residence there. In the case of one who resides in one courtyard, yet passes through or carries in an adjacent courtyard on a daily basis, with or without permission, during the week or on Shabbat: When is he considered a partner to this courtyard who must participate in its <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span>, and when is he considered to be affiliated with a separate domain and does not prohibit members of the courtyard from carrying? Does his use of this domain join residents of the different courtyards into a partnership? Does one of the courtyards render it prohibited to carry in the other courtyard but the other courtyard does not render it prohibited to carry in the first?",

This chapter discusses the case of an individual who does not have a bona fide place of residence, e.g., one traveling to another city, or one who establishes residence along the way. Similarly, this chapter deals with the legal status of one who intends to establish residence in a place other than the place where he is located at present, and also considers the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> with regard to one who went outside his Shabbat limit and thereby forfeited his rights within that limit.

Or, is the Shabbat limit determined by the individual's very presence at a specific location? ",

Or, perhaps, if they belong to a specific individual, the limit for these objects is determined by the limit of their owner. ", 
                "An additional fundamental problem is with regard to the manner in which one acquires the <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span>. The joining of Shabbat boundaries is based upon one's decision to acquire residence at a given distance from his present location. The <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> is generally established through the placement of food sufficient for two meals at the location where one seeks to acquire residence. However, the question arises: Are there other methods in which this may be accomplished? For example, does one's decision that he intends to establish residence at a specific location suffice even without placing the food there? Alternatively, is it sufficient for one merely to visit that location during the day, even if he neither stays there nor places an <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span>? ",

                "Tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Moed Katan</span><sup>1</sup><span class=\"it-text CharOverride-1\"> </span>deals mainly with the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> pertaining to the intermediate days of the Festival, which are often referred to as simply: The Festivals, in rabbinic literature.<sup>2</sup> The discussion of these <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> leads to a comprehensive treatment of two other fundamental areas of <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>: The <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of mourning and the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of ostracism.", 
                "Combining the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of days of rejoicing with the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of days of sadness in one tractate is seemingly contradictory, yet there exists a double connection between the two topics. First, there is a practical halakhic connection between these areas of <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>,<span class=\"it-text\"> </span>as the labors that are prohibited on the intermediate days of the Festival are similar to the labors that are prohibited both during the period of mourning and with regard to one who is ostracized, as he must act as if he is in mourning. It is reasonable, then, to discuss these prohibitions in the same context. Second, there is an intrinsic connection between the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of the intermediate days of the Festival and the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of mourning in that they are derived in a parallel manner. ", 
                "The essential elements of both the intermediate days of the Festival and the period of mourning are mentioned in the Torah, and some of the broader details are alluded to as well. However, they do not appear as explicit commandments or obligations, and consequently are treated in talmudic literature as rabbinic commandments<sup>3</sup> that are part of the oral tradition. This is the case despite the fact that they are mentioned in the written Torah and were practiced in the time of Moses. Even the Sages who maintain that these <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> have a basis in Torah law agree that with regard to the specific details, the Bible delegated them to the Sages.<sup>4</sup> As a result, the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> discussed in this tractate are not based on the objective categories that characterize Torah law, but like most rabbinic commandments are dependent on circumstances and relative to the situation. ", 
                "This means that there is a basic difference between the labor prohibitions on the intermediate days of the Festival and those on Shabbat and the first or last days of the Festival. On Shabbat and Yom Kippur, “all labor” (Exodus 20:10), i.e., all creative, physical labor as defined by the Sages, is prohibited, and similar prohibitions apply to Festivals with a few exceptions, one of which is labor performed for the purpose of food preparation. In contrast, on the intermediate days of the Festival and during the period of mourning there is no objective prohibition against labor in its usual halakhic definition. Rather, the prohibition is against work, which is defined based on the amount of effort, exertion, or professional expertise that is involved in a given activity. ", 
                "Additionally, these <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of prohibited work are not absolute, as their main function is to preserve the unique nature of the day in order to ensure that it is not treated like an ordinary weekday. They therefore include certain leniencies such as, <span class=\"it-text\">inter alia</span>, in cases of incurred loss. These are not objective categories that depend on the nature of the labor, but rather they are categories that depend on the relationship between the person performing the action and the labor he needs to perform. Thus, on the intermediate days of the Festival one is permitted to do work that is specifically related to and necessary for the Festival. However, he may not treat these days as ordinary weekdays by performing labor that is unrelated to its celebration.", 
                "It is the Sages who determine the criteria of what is prohibited on these days. They take into account issues such as when does a certain labor constitute degrading the Festival by treating it as a non-sacred day, and when, due to a specific need or for the purpose of enjoyment of the Festival, is it permitted to perform that labor? These same considerations play a role in determining what is permitted during the period of mourning. These days do not have a fundamental prohibition against labor, but rather one has an obligation to direct his attention to mourning and not turn them into ordinary days of routine where he is occupied with his normal work and occupations and cannot give appropriate attention to his mourning.", 
                "As there are no comprehensive categories governing the prohibition of labor on these days, the Sages were forced to establish many isolated <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> that address specific situations. The Gemara in one place calls these: Sterile <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span>,<sup>5</sup> in that each instance must be addressed separately: Does this activity involve a desecration of the Festival either due to excessive exertion or by resembling an activity performed on weekdays that would make this day seem ordinary and routine? Additional considerations include the indispensable needs of the individual and of society, and considerations such as the unrecoverable loss that will be incurred by not working on the Festival. Therefore, this tractate contains many individualized rulings which do not fit under one rubric. ", 
                "Due to the fact that so many activities were permitted, the Sages wondered if it would not be better to simply cancel the prohibition of work on the intermediate days of the Festival completely. As these celebratory days did not have any specific ritual obligations, there was concern that they would turn into sole days of idleness.<sup>6</sup> In certain places the Sages in fact drastically limited the scope of the prohibitions of the intermediate days of the Festival.<sup>7</sup>", 
                "In a similar vein, the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of mourning, despite the fact that many of them are mentioned in the Torah and books of the prophets, were never formulated as obligatory commandments. Rather, the Sages consolidated all of the traditions and early customs<sup>8</sup> within general parameters. The <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of mourning establish a specific and defined framework for the expression of sorrow and mourning, the role of which is to provide an opportunity to feel and recognize the extent of the loss, while at the same time limiting the flow of emotions so that they do not destabilize the progression of life. The exemption of acute mourners from all positive commandments as well as the prohibition of labor for all mourners was intended to allow them to deal with the burial of the deceased in a proper and respectful way, as well as to provide time and space for thinking about and feeling the loss of the deceased, expressing sorrow over this loss, and receiving comfort from others. ", 
                "Another aspect of the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of mourning involves the public expression of the pain and loss: The mourner is required to rend his clothes, sit on the ground, and overturn his bed. Furthermore, the mourner is required to refrain from both pleasure and expressions of human grandeur: The prohibition against taking haircuts and doing laundry is an expression of the former, and the prohibition against donning phylacteries during the first day of mourning is an example of the latter.", 
                "The <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of ostracism, which are explored in depth in this tractate, are related to the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of mourning. Excommunication and ostracism are not simply punishments involving social isolation; they are a form of banishment that requires one to act as though in mourning. Many of these <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> are derived from and connected to those of a leper, who in a certain respect is ostracized and in mourning as well.", 
                "There is another point of contact between the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of mourning and those of the intermediate days of the Festival: When the period of mourning overlaps with Shabbat and Festivals. This raises the difficulty of the conflict between the commandments of rejoicing and delight on these days with the obligation to feel sorrow and mourning. Essentially, it was determined that the general obligations of taking delight in Shabbat and rejoicing on the Festival cancel the obligation of outward expression of personal mourning.", 
                "There are three chapters in tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Moed Katan</span>. The first two mainly discuss the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of the intermediate days of the Festival, while the third focuses on the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of mourning, ostracism, and excommunication. Although this division is not absolute, as the Talmud often merges the discussion of various topics, each chapter has specific topics to which the discussion therein is dedicated:", 
                "Chapter One discusses the activities that are prohibited during the course of the Festival, both those that are prohibited because they are considered work and those that would minimize the joy of the Festival.", 
                "Chapter Two deals with the details of work that is permitted on the Festival due to the financial loss that would be incurred by abstaining from this work and due to other considerations.", 
                "Chapter Three briefly addresses the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of shaving and writing during the Festival. The main discussion, however, revolves around a comprehensive analysis of the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of mourning and the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of ostracism and excommunication.

                "Among the activities permitted on the intermediate days of the Festival are those that are defined as incurring financial loss, i.e., refraining from this work will cause significant loss, and therefore the Sages permitted them on the intermediate days of the Festival.", 
                "Another category of permitted activity on the intermediate days of the Festival includes labors that are not performed by craftsmen, i.e., those that do not require a specific skill, or that are not performed in the manner of the craftsmen. Additionally, an activity that is necessary for the celebration of the Festival would be permitted on the intermediate days of the Festival. In general, the Sages prohibited labors that involved significant exertion, especially those that were directly related to agricultural labor.", 
                "Because there was often a clash between the various criteria delineated above, the Sages established individualized rulings on a case by case basis.

                "With regard to the injunction to rejoice on the Festival, it was concluded that one should not do anything on the intermediate days of the Festival that would likely lead to distress. Thus, a priest may not examine a leper on the intermediate days of the Festival, and one may not make public eulogies during this period. Out of a similar concern for the commandment to rejoice on the Festival, the Sages prohibited marrying during this time, as this would impinge upon the preparations for the Festival as well as introduce a conflicting source of celebration."

The Gemara brings in other topics, particularly regarding the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of mourning and of ostracism. These <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> are included here because there is a certain similarity between the seven days of rejoicing of a Festival and the seven days of mourning.

An error of perception, a lack of care, and in some cases even willful deception can lead to mistakes in the calendar and the dates of the Festivals. The basic issue addressed in this chapter is how to examine and ascertain the trustworthiness of both the witnesses themselves and the testimony they deliver. Various problems arise in this regard, some of which apply to all forms of testimony, e.g., witnesses who are unsure about exactly what they saw, a pair of witnesses who contradict one another with regard to the details of their testimony, errors of identification, and mistakes in the narration of events. However, a unique issue applies to testimony for the New Moon, as the court has its own reckoning for when the new moon should appear. To what extent must the court accept at face value the testimony it hears, or may it rely on its own mathematical and astronomical calculations? It is possible that these calculations can be used as a method of determining the truth or otherwise of the eyewitness testimony. Alternatively, the court's expectations might be considered mere guidelines, a reason for the court to be skeptical about a certain testimony. ",

Owing to these problems, and due to the unique importance of testimony to determine the beginning of the month, far more severe demands were placed on the witnesses to the appearance of the new moon than for any other testimony. One requirement in particular stands out in this regard: The demand that testimony be provided by others concerning the reliability of these witnesses. In this case the court did not accept the general presumption that one who comes to testify is considered qualified in the absence of grounds for suspecting otherwise.

                "The conclusion of the Sages is that time, and even more so Festivals, cannot be measured as an abstract concept, but must be connected and intertwined directly with observed reality. Therefore, they preferred to base the calendar on witnesses who saw the new moon, along with the science and mathematics of astronomical calculations. Notwithstanding the many practical difficulties caused by requiring witnesses and testimony, there is also one great benefit. It provides an empirical check of the theoretical knowledge and calculations.", 
                "Furthermore, the Sages recognized that time on earth is not uniform on all parts of the globe. Therefore, they set fixed locations as the basis for their calculations. Just as the secular world uses Greenwich Mean Time, locating the center of their calculations near London, the Sages used the location of the Sanhedrin in Eretz Yisrael and derived from that various other geographical markers for their calculations. These calculations were used to verify the witnesses' testimony, and they served as a theoretical basis for a calendar that could be independent of a court and witnesses. Due to the many harsh decrees against the Jewish people, eventually the <span class=\"it-text\">Nasi</span>, Hillel the Second, established the fixed calendar, which is based solely on these calculations. The early authorities discussed its halakhic basis and its details. This calendar is used to this day.", 
                "The task of setting calendar events, including the Festivals, was primarily given to humanity, through the witnesses who observed the occurrences and through the court, which accepted and authorized their testimony and fixed the dates of the Festivals. Through this process, the court and the Jewish people became partners with God. Additionally, it ensured the centrality of Eretz Yisrael, where the court was located and from where the calculations were made. Setting the calendar based on the Jewish people, in their chosen land, based on the words of the Torah of God, ensures that the Festivals symbolize the relationship between the nation and God.", 
                "Establishing the Festivals in one central location creates many obstacles. The witnesses must reach the court, their testimony must be examined, and the decisions of the court must be made known to the residents of Eretz Yisrael and the Diaspora. Technical communication difficulties, as well as intentional sabotage perpetrated by those with ulterior motives, required the establishment of a complex system of laws in order to ensure a single, accurate calendar. The Sages established a second Festival day in the Diaspora both to safeguard against possible errors due to faulty communications and to stress the centrality of Eretz Yisrael.", 
                "Although there are up to six different New Years in the Jewish calendar (see 7b), there is only one New Year that is called simply <span class=\"it-text\">Rosh HaShana</span>. This is the first of Tishrei. This Festival is described by the Torah as “A day of blowing the <span class=\"it-text\">shofar</span>” (Numbers 29:1), and “A memorial proclaimed with the blast of <span class=\"it-text\">shofar</span>” (Leviticus 23:24). Sounding the <span class=\"it-text\">shofar</span> is the unique and central mitzva of the day. Unlike the sounding of the <span class=\"it-text\">shofar </span>in the Temple accompanying the choir of Levites, the <span class=\"it-text\">shofar </span>blasts on Rosh HaShana are not intended to create a pleasant, musical sound. Their essence combines elements of remembrance, proclamation, warning, and majestic coronation. These <span class=\"it-text\">shofar </span>blasts must be done in a specific manner. The Gemara discusses the precise details of fulfilling this mitzva, including the specifications of the <span class=\"it-text\">shofar</span> itself, the timing of the blasts, and the manner in which they are sounded. ", 
                "Since the <span class=\"it-text\">shofar </span>of Rosh HaShana is not sounded solely in the Temple, but in every place for every Jewish person, rabbinic decrees were instituted to prevent unintentional transgression of Torah laws. For this reason, the Sages decreed that the <span class=\"it-text\">shofar</span> may not be sounded on Shabbat, except for inside the borders of the Temple or the central court. ",

However, on Shabbat the <span class=\"it-text\">shofar</span> is sounded only in the central location of the Temple. The Sages prohibited sounding the <span class=\"it-text\">shofar</span> outside the Temple, due to the concern that one might carry it in the public domain. After the destruction of the Temple, it was permitted to sound the <span class=\"it-text\">shofar</span> only in the place of the main court, and even this permission was annulled over the course of time. ", 
                "Incidental to the above, this chapter discussed other ordinances that were instituted in the wake of the destruction. The upheavals suffered by the Jewish people in this period necessitated changes in various areas of <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>, some of which led to stringencies, while others involved leniencies. Certain activities that were permitted only due to the sacred service were subsequently prohibited, while other matters were left intact, both in commemoration of the Temple and in the hope that it would be speedily rebuilt.

                "With regard to the <span class=\"it-text\">shofar</span>, it was concluded that it does not have to be sounded at a fixed time of day.

Furthermore, the soundings must proceed in a specific set of <span class=\"it-text\">tekia-terua-tekia</span> blasts. Since even in early times there were different opinions and customs with regard to the precise definition of these blasts, the number and types of soundings increased over the course of the generations so as to enable the listeners to fulfill their obligation according to all opinions."

The Torah employs the term <span class=\"it-text\">shofar</span>; it is necessary to clarify what this term includes and excludes, e.g., what material it is made of; how it is made; what its size is; whether it must have a specific shape, and so forth. The other issue that will be discussed is the manner in which the <span class=\"it-text\">shofar</span> may be sounded. The Torah mentions different types of sounds, so that it must be clarified whether one fulfills his obligation by hearing any type of sound or whether specific sounds are required. Is there a precise formula for the <span class=\"it-text\">shofar</span>'s sounding, or may it be sounded in any desired fashion? These issues will form the main discussion in this chapter."

The Gemara elaborates on the Torah source for the institution of agency, with regard both to betrothal and to other areas of <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>. The Gemara investigates the question of who can appoint an agent, who can be appointed as one, and under which circumstances agency is effective.",

This is tangentially related to errors or deviations in other forms of transactions. The Gemara also deals with cases where the betrothal is contingent upon something particular concerning the husband or wife being true or not true, e.g., family lineage or financial status.", 
                "In addition, this chapter considers how money effects betrothal. As was taught in the previous chapter, a woman can be betrothed with one <span class=\"it-text\">peruta </span>or an item worth one <span class=\"it-text\">peruta</span>. This chapter clarifies the possibility of using items that are in the possession of the groom but are not considered his property for betrothal, e.g., an item from which one is prohibited to derive benefit.", 
                "Finally, the Gemara speaks about betrothal in which the act of acquisition was not performed appropriately, as well as cases where the man tried to betroth multiple women simultaneously but it was prohibited for some of the women to become betrothed to him."

Specifically, the condition must be stated before the action to which it refers. Furthermore, it must be a compound condition, i.e., one must detail what will happen both if the condition is fulfilled and if it remains unfulfilled. In addition, the positive formulation of the condition must precede its negative side. Finally, it must be possible for the condition to be performed by means of an agent. One important aspect here is the language of the condition, since if the person specifying the condition uses the phrase: On the condition, none of the above stipulations apply.", 
                "With regard to betrothal, both the man and woman can stipulate that the betrothal take effect only at a later stage. Nevertheless, there is a difference between a case in which they stipulate that the betrothal not go into effect until a later date, and a case where they stipulate that the betrothal should be effective: From now and after a certain period of time. In the former case, there is no betrothal at all until that later date, and the woman can betroth herself to another man in the meantime. In the latter case, if the woman accepts a betrothal from someone else before that time arrives, it is uncertain which of the two betrothals is valid.", 
                "All conditions appended to a betrothal are examined in accordance with the situation at the time of the betrothal. A betrothal is not valid if it is made dependent upon a state of affairs that does not exist at the time, including a change in the family or halakhic status of the man or woman.",

If the other party denies his account, the statement of the first person is effective only insofar as it renders him forbidden to all those people to whom he would be forbidden assuming his claim were true. This is because a person has the right to declare himself forbidden. The other party remains unaffected by his claim.", 
                "The Torah grants a father credibility with regard to his minor daughter, and therefore any statement he issues concerning her betrothal or divorce is binding.

                "This chapter included the main principles concerning the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of betrothal and lineage. If one of the partners to a betrothal is not a member of the Jewish people, e.g., a Canaanite slave or a gentile, the betrothal is entirely ineffective. In this case, the lineage of the offspring follows the mother, which means that the child of a gentile father and a Jewish mother is a Jew. If the members of a couple are forbidden to each other with the punishment of <span class=\"it-text\">karet</span>, their offspring is a <span class=\"it-text\">mamzer</span>, with the exception of one who engages in sexual intercourse with a menstruating woman. In all other cases the betrothal is valid, even if it is prohibited by the Torah. As far as the offspring of these unions are concerned, if the betrothal was entirely permitted then the children's lineage follows that of the father. The exception to this principle is the case of two <span class=\"it-text\">mamzerim</span> who married one another, as, although the match is permitted, their child is also a <span class=\"it-text\">mamzer</span>.

The Gemara explains that the act of betrothal can be performed by means of an agent, although it is preferable, as with all mitzvot, to perform this act on one's own. The Gemara concludes that agency can be carried out only by a halakhically competent, adult Jew, and with the consent of the one for whom one is acting. The one designating the agent must also be a halakhically competent, adult Jew. One cannot act as an agent with regard to an area of <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> in which he or she is not obligated.

It is irrelevant if the existing situation is regarded by the general public to be superior or inferior to the stipulated situation. Additionally, only explicit conditions are taken into account. If one of the parties claims later that he intended for the betrothal to take effect only subject to certain conditions being met, the principle that unspoken matters that remain in the heart are not significant matters applies.", 
                "The Gemara outlines certain limitations with regard to the item given to effect the betrothal. There are certain items that, although they are in the possession of a man, he may not use them for betrothal, as he is not in fact their owner. Included in this category is the portion that a priest receives from an offering, or second tithe. Items from which one is prohibited to derive benefit also cannot be used for betrothal. With regard to most items from which one is prohibited to derive benefit, if the man sold them it is permitted for him to betroth a woman with the proceeds from the sale. An exception to this would be an item which is forbidden because it was used for idol worship. A man can betroth a woman with an item that possesses sanctity, e.g., <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span>, tithe, or produce of the Sabbatical Year.

The similarities and differences between these types of acquisition, as well as between the acts of betrothal and divorce, will be discussed in this chapter.", 
                "Due to the unique nature of this particular acquisition with money, in which a woman transfers herself to the authority of a man as his wife, the focus is on several key issues: The precise formula that must be said; whether this statement must be issued by the man or if it can be said by the woman; and whether it must be the man who gives the money to the woman or if she can give it to him. Furthermore, the Gemara discusses the required response from the woman. If she does not overtly reject the betrothal but acts in a manner that can be interpreted as a refusal, e.g., by discarding the money or by insisting on receiving an item she had asked for while ignoring his request to turn the transaction into a betrothal, what is the status of this betrothal? How clear must her acceptance or refusal of the betrothal be?", 
                "The Gemara will also compare the method of acquisition of betrothal to the establishment of other legal relationships, e.g., the obligations of a guarantor and the purchase of a Canaanite slave. Also discussed are the differences between betrothal and the marriage canopy. Likewise, the Gemara discusses the difference between a standard betrothal and the other primary forms of acquisition of a woman, namely levirate marriage and the purchase of a young girl as a maidservant, a transaction that can later result in marriage between the maidservant and her master or his son.", 
                "Another central topic that will be addressed is the item with which a woman is betrothed. How much must the man give her? Must it be actual money, or can he give her an item worth money? Must she accept a physical item into her possession, or does it suffice that she gains some sort of intangible benefit? Is the avoidance of a loss also considered a benefit in this context?", 
                "After debating at length the characteristics of the acquisition of betrothal, the chapter proceeds to analyze various other forms of acquisition. In particular, the acquisition and release of Hebrew slaves and maidservants, and Canaanite slaves and maidservants, is discussed at length. The main focus of this section of the chapter is not the nature of an acquisition but the modes of acquisition. In other words, the formal actions by which ownership is transferred from one party to another. The differences between the modes of acquisition are a result of several factors: The basic nature of the acquisition in question, i.e., whether it is the purchase of an item itself or the right of use of an item; the item that is acquired, which might be a person or a vessel; and the physical nature of the item, i.e., whether it is fixed in one spot, like real estate, or mobile.", 
                "If the item is movable, the key issue is the manner in which it is generally moved: Is it pulled, lifted, or transported by some other method? Typically, the mode of acquisition will match the manner in which the item is usually handled. Each mode of acquisition must be discussed both on its own terms and in relation to the others in order to determine the most appropriate form of transfer in each particular case.", 
                "Another broad topic that will be discussed in this chapter is an entirely different type of acquisition: The eternal acquisition of life through Torah and mitzvot. One must study all areas of the Torah: Bible, Mishna, and Talmud, while ensuring that he can earn an honest living at the same time. Not all six hundred and thirteen mitzvot apply equally to all Jews. There are differences between the obligations of men and women: Just as certain mitzvot apply only to priests, so too, there are mitzvot that are incumbent solely on men. Likewise, there is a distinction between mitzvot that can be fulfilled only in Eretz Yisrael and those that are not dependent on the land but are obligatory in all places."

Therefore, while this chapter dealt with a great variety of issues, a full analysis of their details is found elsewhere.",

Although acquisition through intercourse is halakhically valid, the Sages prohibited it in practice as licentious behavior. A husband's acquisition of his wife can be severed either via a bill of divorce or through his death. By Torah law, a <span class=\"it-text\">yevama</span> can be acquired by her <span class=\"it-text\">yavam</span> only through intercourse.

The exceptions are <span class=\"it-text\">kiddush</span> on Shabbat, eating <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span> on the first night of Passover, the slaughter and eating of the Paschal offering, rejoicing on a Festival, and assembly, performed on Sukkot following the Sabbatical Year. Conversely, women are obligated in most positive mitzvot that are not time bound, apart from Torah study, procreation, and mitzvot that a father must perform on behalf of his son. With regard to negative mitzvot, women have the same requirements as men, with the exceptions of the prohibition against rounding the corners of one's head, the prohibition against shaving one's beard, and the prohibition against priests contracting ritual impurity imparted by a corpse.", 
                "Concerning mitzvot that are dependent on a particular place, all those that involve the land or the produce of the land are applicable only in Eretz Yisrael, although some of them apply partially in Syria and other neighboring countries by rabbinic law. Exceptions include <span class=\"it-text\">orla</span>, diverse kinds of food crops in a vineyard, and the new crop. These prohibitions are in effect even outside of Eretz Yisrael, albeit not by Torah law. All other mitzvot, which are personal obligations as opposed to duties that apply to the land, are in effect in all places.",

                "Ten types of lineage are listed in the beginning of the chapter, each of which entails restrictions concerning whom one with this lineage may marry. Other special cases are High Priests; Egyptian, Edomite, and Ammonite converts; and those disqualified from marrying due to having mutilated genitals. The Gemara concludes with regard to those who may not marry into the congregation due to a definite flaw in lineage that they may nevertheless marry into each other's families. Those whose lineage is of uncertain status, such as a <span class=\"it-text\">shetuki</span> and a foundling, may not marry those whose lineage is definitely flawed.", 
                "With regard to members of the priesthood with flaws specific to the priesthood, i.e., <span class=\"it-text\">halalim</span>, the status of their children is determined by the status of the father.", 
                "Converts are not considered to be part of the congregation of the Lord with regard to marriage, and may marry even those with flawed lineage. A female convert may not marry a priest, but the child of a convert and a born Jew may marry a priest <span class=\"it-text\">ab initio</span>.", 
                "The general presumption is that all Jewish families are of unflawed lineage. If there is a particular family about whom an uncertainty has arisen as to their lineage, one must investigate the lineage of the preceding four or five generations of the family, or until one discovers a member of the family that was otherwise confirmed to be of unflawed lineage, before marrying a member of that family. The working assumption is that young children who cling to a woman are her children, and if she is of unflawed lineage, they are assumed to be of unflawed lineage as well.", 
                "The prohibition against a man being secluded with a woman whom he is prohibited from marrying is alluded to in the Torah. The Sages later instituted an ordinance that a man may not be secluded with an unmarried woman or with a gentile woman. It is permitted for a man to be secluded with his mother or daughter, or with his wife even if she is currently forbidden to him as the result of her status as a menstruating woman. It is likewise permitted to be secluded with a person of the same gender or with an animal. Two men may be secluded with one woman, but if they are known to be steeped in sexual immorality it is prohibited. Many women may not be secluded with one man. If there is a door open from a room to the public domain, those inside the room are not considered to be secluded. Those men whose professions bring them in close, constant contact with women must take additional precautions not to be secluded with them.", 
                "The Sages recommended that one learn a trade that will allow him time for Torah study and will not tempt him to transgress any prohibitions, specifically those involving theft and forbidden sexual intercourse. One whose main occupation is Torah study is protected from all evil and will inherit the World-to-Come."

            "Introduction to Kiddushin": [
                "The order of <span class=\"it-text\">Nashim</span> primarily deals with all things that relate to marriage: The life of the couple, the financial aspects of the relationship between a husband and wife, widowhood, levirate marriage, the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> with regard to forbidden sexual relationships, unfaithful spouses, and the willing dissolution of a marriage. It also touches upon vows and naziriteship. It is only tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Kiddushin</span>, the final tractate in this order, that is primarily devoted to the different elements of the act of <span class=\"it-text\">Kiddushin</span>, betrothal.", 
                "There are many elements of marital life, and tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Kiddushin</span> is focused primarily on clarifying how the first stage of the marital bond, betrothal, is established. In other words, how do a man and woman become a married couple? How are they transformed into one new entity, a family? The bond of marriage is not formed by virtue of the couple residing together, nor does it result from bringing shared offspring into the world. The marital relationship, while not a blood relationship, is in some ways stronger than any other familial bonds. There are ramifications that result from this union with regard to different areas of <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>.", 
                "Betrothal is, from a legal perspective, a positive mitzva. When a man wishes to marry a woman, which he is obligated to do in order to fulfill the mitzva of procreation, he must first betroth her. Tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Kiddushin</span> does not discuss the biblical source for this mitzva, nor does it discuss the details of the wedding ceremony. Instead, this tractate clarifies the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot </span>of betrothal.", 
                "In the Torah, this betrothal is called <span class=\"it-text\">eirusin</span>, but the Sages refer to it as <span class=\"it-text\">kiddushin</span> (see <span class=\"it-text\">Kiddushin</span> 2b). Similarly, the Torah uses the verb “take” to connote the effecting of betrothal. The betrothal bond on its own does not constitute a complete marriage, as there still remains the wedding ceremony, or <span class=\"it-text\">nisuin</span>, as it is referred to by the Sages. Although the betrothed couple does not enjoy the rights that come along with marriage until that point, their connection and their mutual obligation to one another is created through the act of betrothal.", 
                "The Torah does not elaborate on how the betrothal process is carried out. These details were instead transmitted through the Oral Law and are derived through precise readings of the Written Torah.", 
                "There are differences of opinion in the Talmud with regard to the specifics, but the main components of betrothal are agreed upon by everyone. They include four fundamental elements. The first is the manner in which betrothal is effected. The second is the intent of the man and the woman with regard to the betrothal. The third is the requirement that witnesses see the act of betrothal. The fourth is the requirement that the man and the woman be halakhically eligible to become betrothed to one another.", 
                "There are three modes of acquisition, i.e., ways in which the betrothal bond can be effected. A woman can be betrothed by means of money or an item of monetary value being given to her from a man; via a document in which the man writes that the document should effect betrothal; or through an act of intercourse with the stated intention that it effect betrothal. Although there are those who say that betrothal can also be performed by means of the couple entering a wedding canopy, this opinion is not accepted as <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>.", 
                "In each case, it must be clear that the act is being performed for the sake of the betrothal, most often via a clear and explicit statement made by the man who wishes to betroth the woman. Betrothal does not take effect without the knowledge and consent of both sides; nevertheless, a father can betroth his daughter to a man provided that the daughter is not yet an adult. Both parties to the betrothal must be competent, and therefore an imbecile, a male minor, or a female minor on her own cannot be party to betrothal. Since betrothal is dependent on the will and consent of both parties, the Sages provide different conditions, both with regard to the time and the circumstances, under which a betrothal takes effect.", 
                "The witnesses for betrothal are not meant to serve as witnesses for authentication; rather, their participation is an intrinsic element of the betrothal. Consequently, betrothal that was performed without witnesses is disregarded, even if both parties agree that the act of betrothal took place.", 
                "In some cases, the halakhic status of one or both of the parties prevents betrothal from taking effect. If one of the parties is either a Canaanite slave or a gentile, then the betrothal does not take effect. Similarly, the betrothal does not take effect when the two parties are forbidden to each other due to a prohibition punishable by <span class=\"it-text\">karet</span>, either because they are relatives or because she is a married woman. By contrast, when a less severe prohibition is involved, the betrothal takes effect after the fact, although intercourse between the parties is forbidden. The punishment incurred for their act of intercourse will depend on the details of the prohibition.", 
                "Betrothal is an act of acquisition, and therefore it is similar to other types of acquisition in a number of ways. Once the betrothal takes place, the bond between the couple no longer depends on will or agreement. Instead, the boundaries of their bond are set and stand firm, as they do with regard to other prohibitions. With regard to this, there is a similarity between betrothal and consecration, to which the term <span class=\"it-text\">kiddushin</span> is related. The act of consecration also depends on the will of the person who consecrates the item, and once it is performed an essential change takes effect that cannot be canceled or altered.", 
                "At the time of betrothal, an essential halakhic bond is formed between the man and the woman, rendering the woman forbidden to every other man and rendering both parties forbidden to engage in intercourse with each other's relatives. This bond can be canceled or altered only via the options specified in the Torah, i.e., through a bill of divorce or death. Even these methods do not cancel the bond with her former husband entirely; rather, they allow the woman to marry another man who is not his relative. Nevertheless, the familial bond created by the betrothal, which renders the woman's relatives forbidden to the man and the man's relatives forbidden to the woman, remains in place.", 
                "As an act of acquisition, betrothal includes a number of elements that are common to other acts of acquisition. These include the possibility of setting conditions with regard to the amount of money used for betrothal, provided it is sufficient to effect an acquisition; setting conditions with regard to the time when the betrothal will take effect, i.e., immediately or after a specified period of time; and with regard to the possibility of appointing an agent to effect betrothal. A betrothal is canceled in the event of a mistaken transaction, if it becomes clear that that there was deception or a fundamental error with regard to the personalities, status, or living conditions of the couple. This is in contrast to conditions that were agreed upon by both parties from the outset.", 
                "The dual nature of the bond of betrothal means that, although it constitutes a bond of acquisition, the ordinary <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of acquisition do not apply. Instead there are unique <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> that do apply. Additionally, the complexity of the bond cannot be defined through the simple terms of buyer and seller, or giver and receiver. Betrothal should be seen as a legal act of acquisition that establishes a relationship that is essentially non-acquisitional; rather, it unifies two individuals as one new entity.", 
                "Tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Kiddushin</span> contains four chapters that explore a variety of topics. While some of these topics are discussed throughout multiple chapters, each chapter has its unique focus:", 
                "Chapter One deals primarily with the modes of acquisition through which a woman can be betrothed and released. Tangentially, it discusses the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of acquisition in all areas, the obligations with regard to mitzvot for parents and their children, the differences between men and women with regard to the obligation to perform mitzvot, and the differences between mitzvot that are obligatory only in Eretz Yisrael and those that obligatory even outside of Eretz Yisrael.", 
                "Chapter Two discusses the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of agency with regard to betrothal, provides an explanation of items that can and cannot be used to betroth a woman, and discusses the effect of different conditions stated by the couple at the time of the betrothal.", 
                "Chapter Three addresses the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of conditions made with regard to betrothal. When a condition is nullified, will it cause the betrothal to be nullified? What is the proper way to phrase such a condition? Additionally, the chapter deals with situations in which there is a mistake or uncertainty concerning the identity of the betrothed parties. The end of the chapter contains general <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> with regard to the couple: Which unions are permitted, which are forbidden, and the relevant <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> concerning both types of unions and the children born from such relationships.", 
                "Chapter Four deals primarily with the status of those born from permitted and forbidden unions, and it addresses the prohibition against seclusion with a woman other than one's wife.",

                "1\tThis is the common order of the tractates. The Rambam explains that tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Kiddushin</span> is placed after tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Gittin</span> in order to preserve the ordering of the verse: “And she departs out of his house and goes and becomes another man's wife” (Deuteronomy 24:2). By contrast, according to the Meiri this tractate is the first in the order. The <span class=\"it-text\">ge'onim</span> maintain likewise.", 
                "2\tIn the Torah, the word appears only as a verb: “Betrothed a wife” (Deuteronomy 20:7), and: “A maiden who has been betrothed” (Deuteronomy 22:25).", 
                "3\tThe verb “take” used in reference to a woman can either be a reference to betrothal, as in the verse: “For when a man shall take a woman and engage in sexual intercourse with her” (Deuteronomy 22:13), or a reference to marriage as in the verse: “Who betrothed a wife but did not take her” (Deuteronomy 20:7). Additionally, the term is used as a euphemism for sexual intercourse, as indicated in the verse: “When a man shall take his sister” (Leviticus 20:17). Consequently, the Sages required precision with regard to the manner in which each term should be understood in its context. There are disagreements with regard to certain details, both in the Gemara and among later halakhic authorities.", 
                "4\tBy Torah law, a father's right to betroth his minor daughter is unique to him. The Sages later established that a minor girl's mother or brothers can betroth her in the event that the father has died. Nevertheless, because such a betrothal does not take effect by Torah law, it can be canceled through the girl's refusal alone.", 
                "5\tThe Sages instituted betrothal for deaf-mutes, who were not considered to be halakhically competent, but such a betrothal applies by rabbinic law only.",

But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan. (Numbers 32:29–30)", 
                "This chapter deals with three topics: The conditions stipulated between a man and woman at the time of their betrothal; betrothals concerning which there is uncertainty with regard to the identity of one of the partners; and principles with regard to permitted and forbidden betrothals, those that are valid and those that are not.", 
                "This chapter provides a fundamental analysis of the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of conditions in general: How must a condition be formulated for it to be binding? It also discusses the meaning of various conditions stipulated at the time of a betrothal. One case concerns a condition that the betrothal take effect after a certain period of time or after a change in the personal status of the man or woman. These discussions focus on both the precise formula of the condition as well as the woman's status between the moment of the betrothal and the date when it goes into effect.", 
                "Another matter addressed in this chapter is situations where the identity of one member of the couple is uncertain. An uncertainty of this kind can result either due to the failure of one partner to clarify fully whom he is betrothing, which is especially likely to occur when the betrothal is performed by means of an agent, or when the claim of a man to have betrothed a woman is denied by her. There are two aspects to these problems: First, the precise meaning of various statements expressed at the time, and second, the credibility of the claimants. To what extent can the statement of one person be relied upon, and to what extent does his claim obligate him?", 
                "The third main subject of this chapter, which is discussed in detail, concerns the question of who is eligible for betrothal. Certain betrothals are entirely permitted. Others are valid despite the fact that they involve a prohibition. In other words, the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of marriage are binding upon the couple, but due to the prohibition entailed in their relationship it is not permitted for them to remain together. Instead, the husband is obligated to give his wife a bill of divorce. Incidental to this issue, the chapter analyzes another important matter, which is closely connected with the topic of the tractate: What is the halakhic status of the offspring of various unions, both permitted and forbidden ones?"

Even if the parents' marriage is accepted after the fact, the children will still have flawed lineage if they inherit that status from one of the parents.", 
                "In terms of who may marry whom, the Torah divides Jews into three categories: Priests, who have particular restrictions dictating whom they may marry; the general Jewish population, who have unflawed lineage; and those Jews who are prohibited from entering into the congregation through marriage. Most of these <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> are delineated explicitly in the Torah. The details not stated there are the primary topic of this chapter.", 
                "With regard to those who are prohibited from entering into the congregation through marriage, it is asked: May they marry each other? What will be the status of their descendants? Children that are born from a union of a priest and a woman whom it was prohibited for him to marry due to prohibitions specific to the priesthood are called <span class=\"it-text\">halalim</span>. In this chapter, the Gemara defines the precise circumstances in which this status is acquired and passed on. Are converts considered to be a full part of the congregation? Or are they perhaps a category of their own, with their own restrictions and allowances as far as whom they may marry?", 
                "As a continuation of the topic of betrothal, and as a final topic of the order of <span class=\"it-text\">Nashim</span>, the Gemara discusses the prohibition against men and women being secluded. The strength of human sexual desire and the severity of prohibitions of this type require additional safeguards to ensure that people will not come to sin. By Torah law, a man may not be secluded with a married woman other than his wife. The Sages added restrictions against being secluded with unmarried women as well. The Gemara in this chapter addresses what constitutes seclusion, how many people must be present for it to be considered that people are not secluded, and what other steps people should take, particularly in their professional lives, to avoid forbidden contact with the opposite sex."

In addition to abstaining from food and drink, the community recites extra prayers and engages in many rituals to emphasize the importance of the fast and encourage people to amend their behavior and spiritual state. These rituals are an especially prominent feature of the severe fast days, when it is vital to arouse the people's hearts to repentance. ",

If the danger is immediate, the fast day is decreed as near as possible to the event in question. However, it is not necessary for the event to pose an urgent threat.

However, if the disaster is liable to spread, such as an infectious disease and the like, all those living in that country or region must fast as well.

These narratives serve an instructional purpose by providing a vivid demonstration that God indeed answers the prayers and requests of the worthy. They also suggest a broad definition of the righteous individual, as they indicate that the identity of the truly righteous is not always known. Furthermore, these narratives teach that anyone who exerts himself in good deeds should pray for assistance on behalf of the community, even if he is not recognized as an especially sacred individual."

The first includes rituals and customs such as the recitation of prayers in the city thoroughfare instead of the synagogue; the placement of ashes on the heads of the people; the removal of the ark, with ashes placed on it, to a public arena; and many other customs all meant to express dread in the face of the developing calamity.

However, so as not to separate themselves from the community, they perform symbolic gestures of solidarity with their lay brethren. The more severe the fast, the greater the participation of these exempt individuals, although the members of a ministering patrilineal family never observe a full fast.",

                "And the land, where you are going over to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and it drinks water as the rain of heaven comes down; a land which the Lord your God cares for; the eyes of the Lord your God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year until the end of the year. (Deuteronomy 11:11–12)", 
                "And the anger of the Lord will be kindled against you, and He will close up the heavens, and there will be no rain, and the earth will not give its fruit, and you will perish quickly from off the good land which the Lord gives you. (Deuteronomy 11:17)", 
                "When heaven is closed up, and there is no rain, when they sin against You; if they pray toward this place, and confess Your name and turn from their sin, when You afflict them; then You hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of Your servants and of Your people Israel, when You teach them the good way in which they should walk; and send rain upon Your land, which You have given to Your people as an inheritance.", 
                "(I Kings 8:35–36)", 
                "This chapter deals with the times of fasts decreed for lack of rainfall. Essentially, it addresses two main issues: The appropriate dates for rainfall, and the order of fasts for a drought. ", 
                "Before discussing the lack of rain, the proper dates of rainfall must be established. The halakhic relevance of this issue involves the times when one mentions and prays for rain, as these formulations are incorporated into the daily prayer service only during the rainy season. It is therefore necessary to establish the start and end of the rainy season. Since the Mishna was composed in Eretz Yisrael and is concerned with life there, the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> in it are geared primarily toward its climate. Consequently, it remains to be determined how Jews living elsewhere should behave, especially residents of places where the rainy season differs greatly from that of Eretz Yisrael. ", 
                "A second question is the declaration of fast days for rainfall: When is a lack of rain considered significant and a possible sign of a drought, which necessitates prayer and even a fast? As more time goes by without rain the position of farmers steadily worsens, and the various sets and cycles of fasts that the Sages decreed likewise increase in severity. These sets of fasts differ from each other in number and rigor. ", 
                "The details of these issues, as well as statements and comments with regard to rain in general, form the subject matter of this chapter."
            ], 
            "Summary of Perek I": [
                "The prayers for rain can be divided into two time periods. Initially, one merely mentions rain, by means of the statement: He makes the wind blow and the rain fall, in the <span class=\"it-text\">Amida</span> prayer in the second blessing, without actually requesting rainfall. This period begins on the Eighth Day of Assembly immediately following <span class=\"it-text\">Sukkot</span>. During the second period, one also requests rain, adding the phrase: And give dew and rain, in the ninth blessing of the <span class=\"it-text\">Amida</span>. In Eretz Yisrael one first recites this prayer on the seventh of Heshvan, while in Babylonia one starts sixty days after the vernal equinox. The <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> for other countries is to act in accordance with the custom of Babylonia, even in places with an entirely different climate. ", 
                "If no rain has fallen a short while after one starts to request rain, i.e., at the proper time for the first rainfall, marking the beginning of the rainy season, Torah scholars start observing private fasts on behalf of the community. If no rain falls, the entire community observes three fasts that start in the morning, on which they pray for rain. If these fasts have passed and still no rain has fallen, three additional, more severe fasts are declared, again for the entire community. These fasts, which commence at nighttime, involve not only a prohibition against eating and drinking but also against other types of comfort. If the lack of rain continues after this set of three fasts, seven more fast days are decreed. These are even more severe than the previous three, as they include many public displays of mourning, designed to awaken the hearts of the community to prayer. ", 
                "Incidental to these discussions, the chapter also addressed the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of an individual fast. Fast days of this kind must be accepted by the individual in question in the afternoon service of the day before. Private fasts generally start in the morning, and they must be fulfilled like any other vow an individual accepts upon himself. "
            ], 
            "Introduction to Taanit": [
                "Tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Ta'anit</span>, as its name indicates, focuses mainly on the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> and themes of fast days [<span class=\"it-text\">ta'aniyot</span>], covering both communal fasts and private, individual fasts and addressing both those that have fixed dates and those that are established from time to time in response to various negative events. In the Jerusalem Talmud and certain works of the early authorities, the tractate is called by the plural term, <span class=\"it-text\">Ta'aniyot</span>.", 
                "The concept of a fast day as a mitzva in its own right does not appear in the Torah. It is true that the Torah refers to Yom Kippur as an affliction of the soul; see, for example, Leviticus 16:29. However, the Torah's description means that unlike regular fasts, this particular fast is for the purification of the soul. Nevertheless, there is a connection between Yom Kippur and the fasts discussed in this tractate, on both the theoretical and the practical levels. ", 
                "There are many references to fasts in the Prophets and Writings. Numerous verses teach about the meaning and purpose of fast days, as well as the manner of their observance, both communal and individual, as they were practiced by the Jewish people in ancient times. Consequently, the content of tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Ta'</span><span class=\"it-text\">anit</span> is based on oral traditions transmitted to Moses at Sinai, as expressed in practical terms in many books of the Bible.", 
                "The fundamental idea of fast days is based on the assumption that events in the world do not happen by chance and for no reason. Rather, just as there are physical causes for occurrences, there are also spiritual and moral explanations. In general terms, reward is bestowed for good deeds and punishment for evil. Human action is scrutinized by Divine Providence, again both on the level of the individual as well as that of the community, or indeed, the entire nation. Therefore, any misfortune visited upon a congregation or an individual has a purpose and a meaning. Sometimes it serves as a warning that one's actions are corrupt and must be amended; on other occasions it is a punishment for sins, as explained at length by the Torah in the chapter of rebuke (Leviticus, chapter 26). Accordingly, in every time of trouble and distress, one should increase his prayers, repent, and make amends for any wrongs he has committed. He should sanctify himself so that his previous transgressions will be forgiven, and pray and beseech God to avert the evil decree. ", 
                "As indicated by the Hebrew word <span class=\"it-text\">ta'anit</span>, a fast is a time of affliction [<span class=\"it-text\">inui</span>]. As explained in the Gemara and in the books of the Prophets and Writings, on a fast day one abstains from eating and drinking. For the most important fasts, the Sages added the prohibitions against wearing shoes, engaging in conjugal relations, anointing, and bathing. Nevertheless, both the prophets and the Sages stress that the fasting and other suffering that one accepts upon himself are not the purpose and ultimate aim of the fast day. See, for example, Isaiah, chapter 57, which is read on Yom Kippur. The fasting and other suffering are merely a means of achieving atonement and purity of the soul. It is prayer, charity, and repentance, i.e., a reconsideration of past actions and an acceptance of improvement for the future, which constitute the main focus of fast days. For this reason tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Ta'anit</span> does not focus on the detailed <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of fasting, but on the other aspects of the day: The additional prayers and spiritual awakening through study and action. ", 
                "The most common misfortune that should stir feelings of repentance is a lack of rain, and therefore most of the tractate deals with this issue. As stated in the Torah (Deuteronomy 11:17), a drought is a sign of God's anger, as both a warning and a punishment. At a time of a dearth of rain, even more than with other disasters, one has no way to improve the situation other than by turning to God and praying. Furthermore, a lack of rain is not simply a local or temporary problem; it can bring catastrophe on the entire country. Much of tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Ta'</span><span class=\"it-text\">anit</span>, and indeed many of the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot </span>of fast days, concern fasts established to entreat God for rainfall.", 
                "Since a drought of rain causes increasingly severe difficulties as time goes on, the fasts become correspondingly severe as well. The Sages did not simply establish one fast day, but several complex cycles of fasts, which become more and more stringent as a drought continues.", 
                "Any communal fast that does not have a fixed date, i.e., which is neither a response to a current emergency nor commemorates a historical event, is established on a Monday or Thursday, the days on which the Torah is read in public and the courts would convene. The cycle of fast days does not occur on the other days of the week but only on these two days, in consecutive order.", 
                "Naturally, there is a gloomy, even mournful, aspect to fasts, as they are declared for sad events and are intended to prevent misfortunes from continuing or becoming worse. One exception to this rule is Yom Kippur, which is classified as a Festival, and which includes the joy of purification. Furthermore, as explained at the end of the tractate, this date was established as a joyful holiday, on which marriageable young girls would go out, dance in the vineyards, and seek husbands.", 
                "These apparently negative features of fast days are designed to awaken one's heart to repentance and have the same goal as public gatherings for prayer, readings from the Torah, speeches of moral reproof and instruction, and all other such activities. The aim is for all the participants to correct their errors and shortcomings, both as a community and as individuals.", 
                "Although drought is the most common and prolonged cause for fasting, any misfortune that befalls a community should be met with prayers and calling out to God. See, for instance, I Kings, chapter 8. This applies to natural disasters such as flooding and storms, attacks of wild animals or locusts, and infectious diseases, as well as to man-made events, e.g., wars or persecution by the ruling authorities. Under certain circumstances, any of these misfortunes could be a reason for the decreeing of a fast. Furthermore, the purpose of the fast can vary. One might pray that a punishment that has already been imposed be canceled or diminished, or entreat God to avert an impending danger. A fast can even be an act of solidarity with the sufferings of another Jewish community, especially one in Eretz Yisrael. This applies to individual fasts as well. ", 
                "Sometimes a person will accept a fast upon himself, generally by means of a declaration during the afternoon service of the previous day, as part of a broader effort to achieve atonement for his sins, or as a request that he will not suffer a certain misfortune, e.g., one that appeared in his dreams. Naturally, the status of a fast of an individual, or even a collection of individuals, is unlike that of a communal fast, with regard to both its severity and to the manner of its initiation. In the case of a community these are determined by the events of the day and the needs of the public. ", 
                "In addition to those fasts, which are a response to current misfortunes and are established in hope of a better future, there are also fixed fast days of memorial which were established to commemorate disasters and occurrences of earlier generations. Yet here too the fast is directed toward the future, as remembering past events is meant to awaken hearts to the general redemption that will be at the end of days. However, these days, which commemorate national disasters, especially those involving the destruction of the First and Second Temples, are not only days of fasting and memorial, but also days of mourning. The most prominent of these dates is the Ninth of Av, which has become a symbol of all the tribulations of the Jewish people, due to the many misfortunes that occurred on this day. Virtually all the mitzvot and prohibitions that apply to someone in mourning for the dead are obligatory for everyone on the Ninth of Av. ", 
                "With the exception of Yom Kippur, all fast days apply by rabbinic law. Admittedly, the fixed fast dates, i.e., the Ninth of Av, the tenth of Tevet, the seventeenth of Tammuz, and the third of Tishrei, are of ancient origin, as they were instituted by the prophets (see Zechariah, chapter 7). However, as they have no basis in the Torah itself, they are considered to be by rabbinical law.", 
                "Since the fasts were established by the Sages, they may not occur on fixed days of delight and rejoicing mandated by Torah law, i.e., Shabbat and Festivals. However, there are other days mentioned in the Torah whose status is not as clear-cut. It must be determined whether fasts can be established on New Moons or the intermediate Festival days, which are days of celebration but not full-fledged Festivals. A similar question applies to festive days established by the Sages over the generations as memorials of happy occasions. When a fast is decreed for a calamity, or when a fast occurs as part of the lengthy cycles of fasts or as a fast of the non-priestly watches, it is possible that it will coincide with one of these days of rejoicing. It is therefore necessary to establish which of these days can be overridden by a fast. ", 
                "Tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Ta'anit</span> consists of four chapters, each dealing with its own topic:", 
                "Chapter One focuses on rainfall, the common dates for the various rainfalls of the year, the significance of rain in general, and the order of the cycles of fasts for rainfall.", 
                "Chapter Two addresses the special prayers and customs of fast days, especially those of the major communal fasts.", 
                "Chapter Three contains a broad discussion of the events for which fasts are decreed. This chapter focuses on the misfortunes mentioned in the previous chapters, as well as other calamities of various kinds. ", 
                "Chapter Four primarily addresses days on which fasting is prohibited, due to the fact that those days have been established as permanent days of rejoicing. It also discusses certain fixed communal fasts in memory of general disasters that befell the Jewish people."
            ], 
            "Summary of Perek IV": [
                "The common denominator of the non-priestly watches and the dates the wood offerings are brought is that they both are occasions when the Jewish people participate to a certain extent in the Temple service. Although the service itself is performed solely by priests, the entire people, or at least a representative group, symbolically join them in their ministering. In addition to the various details of the non-priestly watches and the wood offerings, the Gemara established that on any commemorative day, whether a fixed Festival from the Torah or a day on which <span class=\"it-text\">hallel</span> is recited, the prayers and fasting of the watches are diminished and the joy of the day is emphasized. ", 
                "Another topic that was addressed in this chapter was the fixed days of communal fasts. The Mishna and Gemara explained why these dates were chosen for the memorial fasts, and why they were established as permanent fast days. The main focus was on the Ninth of Av which, due to the numerous national disasters that occurred on this date, is not only established as a fixed communal fast, but is equal in severity to the extreme fasts for rain in that it begins at nightfall and requires all five categories of affliction to be observed. ", 
                "Certain practices of mourning are observed on the Ninth of Av. Essentially, all <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> that apply to an individual mourner are obligatory for everyone on this day, as no actions that gladden the heart may be performed. Moreover, certain periods before the Ninth of Av, specifically the week in which it occurs and the previous eight days of the month, are included in various aspects of the mourning.", 
                "The tractate ends on a positive note, as the Mishna mentions the celebratory atmosphere of Yom Kippur and of the fifteenth of Av, on which special festive events were staged for the entire nation with the aim of bringing the Jewish people together and increasing joy among them."

            "Introduction to Perek III": [
                "If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence, if there is blasting or mildew, locust or caterpillar; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatever plague, whatever sickness there be; any prayer and any supplication made by any man of all Your people Israel, who shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house. Then may You hear in Heaven, Your dwelling-place, and forgive, and do, and render to every man according to all his ways, whose heart You know, for You, You alone, know the hearts of all the children of men. (I Kings 8:37–39)", 
                "Up to this point the tractate has discussed the most commonly decreed fast day, i.e., that which is due to a lack of rain. However, it is certainly appropriate to fast and pray concerning any catastrophe that might strike a community. Several issues arise with regard to this. First, the events that warrant a fast must be clarified, as one should fast only over disasters or very serious troubles, not for every problem encountered. Similarly, there are intermediate cases that are not cause for a fast, but for which it is proper to awaken the congregation to repentance by means of prayers and supplications. ", 
                "In addition to the appropriate conditions for decreeing a fast day, the timing of this declaration is equally important. The order of fasts for rain is more or less fixed, as they depend on the yearly seasons. In contrast, when an event occurs that poses an immediate danger, there is no time to wait before fasting. ", 
                "An additional question concerns the extent of these fasts. There is a difference between disasters and catastrophes that involve the Jewish people as a whole, and events that affect only a particular place or a small group of people. Sometimes a local occurrence is considered a general threat, and occasionally communities are obligated to participate in the distress of Jews living elsewhere. The clarification of these matters is the main issue of this chapter. ", 
                "Another issue discussed here is how to proceed when God answers the prayers and rescues the people from the disaster for which a fast was declared. Is it appropriate to conclude the fast as originally planned, or should it be stopped when the reason for its declaration has been removed? Finally, it is necessary to establish how the community should express its gratitude toward God for responding favorably to its prayers."

                "Thus says the Lord of hosts: The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful Festivals; therefore love truth and peace. (Zechariah 8:19)", 
                "The fasts discussed in the tractate up until this chapter are those decreed upon the public due to a calamity. These fasts, which include fasts for rain, do not occur on fixed dates but are declared in response to a catastrophe that afflicts the Jewish people. However, there is another category of fast days, those that occur on fixed dates every year. ", 
                "The fasts discussed in this chapter are of two very different types. One was observed by the members of the non-priestly watch when the Temple was standing. These fasts were not decreed in response to an event that might have occurred at the time, but were designed for general supplications for the continuation of normal life, for health, and for success. This chapter discusses the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of these fasts, the special prayers for the non-priestly watches, and the relationship between them and the various holidays throughout the year.", 
                "An entirely different type of fast day also discussed in this chapter is the memorial fast, which consists of fasts on dates already decreed following the destruction of the First Temple and reestablished after the Second Temple was destroyed. There are four standard fast days that commemorate general calamities that befell the Jewish people, especially the destruction of the Temple, an event that brought many other catastrophes upon the Jewish people in its wake.", 
                "The clarification of the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of these memorial days, which are not merely fasts but days of national mourning, especially the Ninth of Av, is the main topic of this chapter.

                "As stated in the Torah, labors associated with preparing food, e.g., cooking, baking, and slaughtering, are permitted on a Festival. This allowance raises many dilemmas, and this chapter focuses upon two areas. First, the Torah permitted cooking and baking on a Festival, but this allowance was understood to apply only to what is needed for the Festival itself and not for another day, certainly not for a weekday. The question arises: What should one do when a Festival occurs on a Friday, so that certain preparations for the Shabbat that immediately follows the Festival must perforce be made on the Festival, such as lighting a candle and preparing cooked food? ",

This <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span>, similar to the other <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv</span> enactments of the Rabbis, involves a formal act that unites two different entities into a single unit. Here the <span class=\"it-text\">eiruv </span>mixes together the Festival and Shabbat, so that the meals on the two days are considered not as separate meals but rather as one continuous meal. Therefore, everything that is prepared on the Festival will necessarily be prepared also for Shabbat, without any sense of separation between the two.

The most important question relates to the bringing of sacrificial offerings on a Festival. Should one view an offering brought by an individual that is not eaten, or even one that is eaten by its owner, as something that is needed on the Festival, so that the offering may be brought on the Festival itself? Or perhaps the dispensation extends to people's physical needs alone.

                "Tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Yom Tov</span>, better known as <span class=\"it-text\">Beitza</span> after its first word, deals with the general <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of Festivals. Whereas other tractates in <span class=\"it-text\">Seder Mo'ed</span> address the laws of Shabbat and the mitzvot that are specific to each of the major Festivals, this tractate deals with the laws common to all Festivals. These <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> include the commandment to rest from work, in the form of positive and negative mitzvot that apply to all Festivals. They are derived from the verses “It shall be a solemn rest unto you, a memorial proclaimed with the blast of <span class=\"it-text\">shofarot</span>, a sacred convocation” (Leviticus 23:24) and “You shall do no manner of servile work” (Leviticus 23:7, 8). ", 
                "There is no difference between Shabbat and Festivals with regard to the basic definition of prohibited labor. On Festivals, as on Shabbat, the definition of labor is any action that entails creative work, performed intentionally. The details of the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of prohibited labor on Festivals, and the decrees and enactments of the Sages to safeguard people from transgression and to emphasize the sanctity of the day, are very similar to the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> and enactments for the mitzva of rest and the prohibition against labor on Shabbat. Therefore, the main topics in this tractate can also be found in the tractates that deal with the laws of Shabbat, i.e., <span class=\"it-text\">Shabbat</span> and <span class=\"it-text\">Eiruvin</span>. Indeed, in terms of structure and content, tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Beitza</span> can be seen as a kind of addendum to <span class=\"it-text\">Shabbat</span>, not only in terms of the fundamental concepts but also with regard to the details of its <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span>. Consequently, this tractate addresses neither the sources of its <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> nor the basic definitions of prohibited labor and the mitzva of rest. Its main focus is the elucidation of the differences between Shabbat and Festivals.", 
                "The differences between prohibited labor on Shabbat and that on Festivals come to the fore in two main areas. The first distinction concerns the severity of the sin. The prohibition against performing labor on Shabbat is one of the most severe transgressions in the Torah, as it states: “Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death” (Exodus 31:14). Conversely, the prohibition against performing labor on a Festival is not as severe; rather, it is a regular negative commandment, punishable by lashes. Furthermore, the scope of the prohibition is different. All labor is prohibited on Shabbat, as the verse states: “Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a Shabbat of solemn rest, a holy convocation; you shall do no manner of work; it is Shabbat to the Lord in all your dwellings” (Leviticus 23:3). On Festivals, the prohibition is limited to servile labor: “A holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work.” (Leviticus 23:7). The Sages explained the difference based on a different verse that refers to the festival of Passover: “No manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done by you” (Exodus 12:16). Accordingly, on Festivals the Torah permits labor that is for the purpose of sustenance, i.e., labor related to the preparation of food. The central topic of tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Beitza</span> is the elaboration and explication of this more limited prohibition against performing labor. ", 
                "It was clear to the Sages that not all acts of labor involved in the preparation of food are included in this leniency. The early authorities debate whether the exclusion of certain labors is a rabbinic decree to safeguard the Festival, or if its source is from the Torah itself. There is a fundamental distinction between labors that merely prepare items that can be processed into food, e.g., hunting, harvesting, and similar actions, and labors that actually prepare food for eating, such as cooking and baking. ", 
                "The significance of the different categories of labor is discussed at length by the early authorities. One possibility is that only those labors whose prohibition would prevent the consumption of the food or enable its spoilage on the Festival itself are permitted. Alternatively, only labors usually performed on the day the food will be eaten are allowed on Festivals, whereas labors usually done beforehand are prohibited, even for the sake of the Festival. Likewise, there is some doubt as to whether certain labors are prohibited solely on Shabbat and not at all on a Festival, as they are not labors in the full sense of the term. This debate applies primarily to the labors of carrying out from one domain to another and kindling fire, which are certainly permitted on Festivals. The question is whether these prohibitions are waived only for the sake of food preparation on the Festival, or if they are never applied to Festivals at all.", 
                "Although the Torah permitted labor for the purpose of sustenance on Festivals, the Sages deemed it necessary to create limits and restrictions on this <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>, both so that the sanctity of the Festivals would be preserved and to prevent a Festival from turning into a regular workday, albeit with a few restrictions. Consequently, the Sages established many enactments and safeguards to limit the performance of labor to essential actions that are necessary for the Festival. They also sought to avoid the appearance of industrial labor or commercial transactions. Furthermore, in several areas the Sages were stricter with regard to Festivals than Shabbat, as the less severe punishments and the permission to perform certain labors are liable to cause people to disparage the Festivals. ", 
                "The concerns that led the Sages to limit the scope of permitted actions on a Festival, however, are counterbalanced by another consideration: On Festivals there is a special mitzva to be joyful, as stated in the Torah: “And you shall rejoice in your Festival...and you shall be altogether joyful” (Deuteronomy 16:14–15). This joy, as evident from the context of this passage and its interpretation by the Sages, is expressed and actualized by means of eating, drinking, and wearing beautiful clothing, among other activities (<span class=\"it-text\">Pesahim</span> 109a and elsewhere). Therefore, one must ensure that the restrictions on labor are not so great that they negate the joy of the Festival. Indeed, the appropriate balance between these two considerations, the honor of the Festival as a day of rest on the one hand and a day of joy on the other, is one of the central dilemmas that arise in many discussions in this tractate. ", 
                "The relationship between Shabbat and Festivals concerns not only the halakhic comparisons between them but also the problems that arise when a Festival immediately follows or, especially, precedes Shabbat. The Sages established several enactments for this situation, primarily the joining of cooked foods [<span class=\"it-text\">eiruv tavshilin</span>], both to make it possible to prepare food on the Festival for Shabbat and to ensure that this preparation does not lead one to show disrespect for or neglect the Festival due to the approaching day of rest.", 
                "Another issue that is specific to the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of Festivals is the ancient enactment that people living outside Eretz Yisrael must observe the second Festival day of the Diaspora, in addition to the single day observed in Eretz Yisrael. Initially, this <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> was established due to problems and difficulties in communication between Eretz Yisrael and distant places in the Diaspora. Since the New Moon was declared in Eretz Yisrael, and the dates of the Festivals were determined by the first of the month, inhabitants of distant places would not always know the correct day when the Festival began. The Sages therefore decreed that residents of the Diaspora celebrate two Festival days, one of which would certainly be correct. However, aside from this technical difficulty, many other considerations also motivated this enactment. Consequently, those living outside Eretz Yisrael celebrate two Festival days even in modern times, when the dates of the Festival are established by a fixed calendar.",

Nevertheless, a person may take items, whether from a friend or a shopkeeper, provided that it is done in the manner of borrowing from a neighbor, without stipulating a price or a defined measure as in a commercial transaction.

No distinction is made between peace-offerings, which are eaten, and burnt-offerings, which are not.

One is liable for damage to a person or an animal caused by his pit, but not for damage caused to utensils.

The same holds for a case where two animals, two people, or a person and an animal injure each other: The amount each party is liable to pay is evaluated separately, and the one who is liable to pay more than the other pays the difference.", 
                "When an innocuous ox gores and kills another ox, the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha </span>is that the injured party receives a share of ownership of the belligerent ox, contrary to the opinion that the ox is merely designated repayment for the damage. The carcass of the dead ox belongs to its owner and is not shared by the liable party, but any increase in its value subsequent to the incident is deducted from the share its owner receives in the belligerent ox.", 
                "Four types of indemnity for injury, i.e., humiliation, pain, medical costs, and loss of livelihood, are owed only when a person injures another, not when his ox injures someone. Similarly, one is liable to emancipate his slave only if he himself mutilates the slave, not if his animal does so. Conversely, if one causes damage through an action that carries the death penalty, he is exempt from monetary restitution, since the death penalty is the more severe punishment. If one's ox causes damage in such a manner, he is liable to pay damages.", 
                "If an ox is injured by another ox, but the identity of the belligerent ox is a subject of dispute between the two owners, e.g., one innocuous ox and one forewarned ox were involved in a confrontation, the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha </span>is that the burden of proof rests upon the claimant; in the absence of such proof, he receives nothing. Furthermore, even if the owner of the belligerent oxen admits that he owes compensation to the claimant, but the latter demanded compensation from a different ox, the former's admission does not render him liable to pay. This is analogous to the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> that if one claims that he is owed wheat by another, and the latter admits to owing barley, he is not liable to give him even barley, as his admission is ineffective."

                "This chapter discussed the details of several primary categories of damage for which an animal is deemed forewarned from the start.", 
                "In the preceding chapter it was stated that for Trampling an animal is automatically deemed forewarned, and therefore one must always pay the full cost of the damage classified as Trampling. In this chapter it was clarified that the category of Trampling includes damage caused by the body of an animal moving about in its typical manner. This, therefore, includes not only objects trampled underfoot but also damage caused by any other body parts, including damage caused by an animal's feet and a bird's wings. If the animal was jumping in an atypical manner this is not classified as Trampling but rather as Goring, and therefore the owner must pay for only half the cost of the damage.", 
                "Trampling includes only the damage caused directly by the body of the animal or by articles tied to the body of the animal, even loosely. Nevertheless, if an animal propels debris as it walks, and these flying objects strike other things and cause damage, this constitutes the unique category of pebbles, according to which the owner of the animal must pay for only half the cost of the damage. This category also includes damage caused by wind stirred up by a bird flapping its wings.", 
                "Eating is another category of damage for which an animal is automatically deemed forewarned, but this applies only if the animal ate an item that it normally eats and did so in an ordinary manner. If an animal eats something which it does not typically consume, such as clothing, or if it eats items in an atypical manner, this is considered a situation where the animal intended to cause damage and the owner is liable to pay only half the cost of the damage.", 
                "If the animal caused damage on its way to get to the food, if it acted in its typical manner the owner must pay the full cost of the damage, in accordance with the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of Eating. Furthermore, in a case where an animal ate something in an ordinary manner but indirectly caused greater damage in the process, such as the case of a dog that took a cake that had been baked on coals, and in doing so caused a stack of grain to catch on fire and be burned, the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha </span>then differentiates between the two aspects: He must pay the full cost of the damage to the cake in accordance with the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of Eating, but he must pay for the damage to the stack of grain in accordance with the relevant category, which could be either Fire or pebbles.", 
                "It was further explained that while one is exempt from paying in a case of Eating in a public domain, the owner does need to reimburse the injured party for the benefit the animal derived. It was also clarified that if the damage was caused in an atypical manner, he would have to pay for a case of Eating in a public domain, albeit for only half the cost of the damage.", 
                "Rabbi Tarfon is of the opinion that an animal that causes damage by goring within the domain of the injured party is deemed forewarned, and therefore the owner is liable to pay the full cost of the damage. This, however, is not the final ruling; the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha </span>maintains the distinction between an innocuous and a forewarned animal in all cases of Goring, including damage caused on the private property of the injured party.", 
                "It was also determined that with regard to Goring, an animal can be classified as forewarned if it intentionally caused damage three times at fixed intervals, provided that following each incident witnesses came and testified, issuing warnings to the owner in court. As long as a warning has not been issued the animal remains classified as innocuous, and its owner must pay for only half the cost of the damage it caused. Furthermore, even an animal that was classified as forewarned can revert to innocuous status if experience demonstrates that it no longer poses a threat, such as if children petted it and it did not gore them.", 
                "A person who causes damage with his body is always deemed forewarned, regardless of whether he caused this damage with intent and awareness or without intent and awareness. In all such cases he is obligated to pay the full cost of the damage. The only case in which one is exempt from liability is a case in which he had absolutely no control over the situation or ability to prevent the accident.", 
                "The obligation to fully compensate the injured party applies only to the actual damage; the other punishments and fines imposed upon a person who injures another person are somewhat dependent on the intention of the assailant, and there can therefore be situations in which the assailant does not have to make the additional payments.", 
                "In addition to the above topics, this chapter also included a number of tangential discussions. In conjunction with the obligation to reimburse the injured party for the benefit derived by one's animal from eating another's produce in the public domain, the Gemara discussed the broader topic known as: This one benefits and that one does not suffer a loss. The conclusion is that if one does not suffer any loss whatsoever he cannot demand payment from another who derived benefit from his property.", 
                "The Gemara also discussed the question of liability for damage classified as Fire: Is this similar to the damage caused by arrows that one shot, meaning it is as if he caused the damage directly with his hands, or is Fire similar to damage caused by one's possessions? The conclusion is that the one who ignited the fire is responsible on account of both aspects."

                "Tractate<span class=\"it-text\"> Bava Kamma</span> was originally the first section of a large tractate named Tractate<span class=\"it-text\"> Nezikin</span>, which comprised what are now the first three tractates in the Order of <span class=\"it-text\">Nezikin</span>. From this placement it derived its name, <span class=\"it-text\">Bava Kamma</span>, the first gate. The remaining part of this super-tractate was divided into <span class=\"it-text\">Bava Metzia</span>, the middle gate, and <span class=\"it-text\">Bava Batra</span>, the last gate.", 
                "These three tractates generally address monetary cases and incorporate within their chapters almost the entire range of Jewish civil law, while punishments for criminal offenses and religious transgressions are addressed only tangentially.", 
                "Tractate<span class=\"it-text\"> Bava Kamma</span> treats one specific area of law, the law of torts, in the narrowest meaning of the term. This means that it deals with the range of responsibility and compensation for which one is liable after causing damage to another's body or property, both when the damage was caused by an individual and when it was caused by his possessions, in a direct or indirect fashion.", 
                "The principles of these <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> are founded on the passages of the Torah appearing in the portion of <span class=\"it-text\">Mishpatim</span> (Exodus 21:18–37, 22:1–14). The Torah does not present these <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> in a dry exposition of abstract legal principles but in the form of lively examples drawn from everyday life. In order to be able to apply these examples to other cases, it is necessary to first determine which facets of the cases provided by the Torah are essential elements that define the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> and which facets are just incidental details of the provided example. This is done with the help of the authoritative traditions of the Oral Law and with the tools of legal exegesis.", 
                "Tractate<span class=\"it-text\"> Bava Kamma</span> is subdivided into two sections. The first section (chapters 1–6) covers the topic of damage caused by one's property or by actions that he initiated. The second section (chapters 7–10) concerns damage caused by a person with his own body.", 
                "The laws of torts also include a religious aspect. Many cases involve the transgression of the halakhic prohibitions against robbery, theft, and injury. Nevertheless, one's liability to pay damages is not limited to cases where there was a willful transgression of a prohibition. Rather, even when the damage was caused with no purposeful intent to harm or through neglect, one is liable to pay restitution to the injured party.", 
                "In the first section of <span class=\"it-text\">Bava Kamma</span>, which concerns damage caused by one's property, the key issue is that of the owner's responsibility. It is clear that an owner is responsible for the damage caused by his possessions; what requires clarification are the exact limitations of his responsibility. Does this responsibility extend to include any damage that results from his property or does it include only certain kinds of damage? Does taking the proper precautionary measures exempt one from liability for the damage that occurs despite one's efforts? Is there any difference between compensation payments made for actions performed with premeditation and purposeful intent and actions that were performed unintentionally, through neglect, or as a result of insufficient precautionary measures?", 
                "One's liability for damage depends on the nature and the form of the damage. For this reason, acts that cause damage are classified as being subcategories of various primary categories of damage. ", 
                "From the verses in the Torah it is readily apparent that a distinction exists between damage to property caused by one's animals, since, in the words of the opening mishna, they have a living spirit, and damage caused by one's inanimate possessions. With regard to damage caused by one's animals, a difference exists between cases where the animal's objective was to cause damage and cases where the damage was a consequence of the animal's typical behavior. Damage of the former type is classified as being of the category of Goring. This includes damage caused by goring, kicking, or biting done for the purpose of damaging. Cases of such damage can be further subdivided into instances in which the belligerent animal was innocuous and cases where the animal had already repeatedly caused that form of damage, and the owner had been warned about it, in which case the animal is considered forewarned. Once an animal is forewarned, the level of the owner's responsibility for any damage caused by it is intensified in terms of the extent to which he is required to safeguard his animal to prevent it from causing damage, the amount of restitution he is liable to pay, and the form of payment. Furthermore, the owner incurs liability for such damage in almost every place, whether on private property or in the public domain.", 
                "By contrast, in cases where the damage was a consequence of the animal's typical behavior, the animal's owner is liable only if the damage took place on the property of the injured party and only if such behavior is considered typical for that animal. One category of damage of this type is Eating, in which an animal's actions are motivated by the pleasure it receives in the course of the damage that is causes. Another category is Trampling, where the damage is caused by the animal's typical movements, such as by trampling on items while walking. As liability is incurred only when such behavior is considered typical for that animal, if an animal eats something it does not normally eat, or moves in an atypical manner, the owner is not liable to pay for the damage. Furthermore, in these cases, if the owner took the standard precautionary measures to prevent damage from occurring, he is also exempt from liability.", 
                "In cases of damage caused by one's movable property, a distinction exists between damage caused by one's property when it remains stationary, classified as damage in the category of Pit, and damage caused when a person initiates a hazardous situation that then moves to a different location by itself or due to an additional force such as the wind, classified as damage in the category of Fire. In cases classified as Pit, liability is incurred only where one placed his property in a domain not his own, whether in the public domain or someone else's private property. Furthermore, liability is limited to damage caused to animals and people but does not extend to damage caused to vessels. In cases classified as Fire, one is liable wherever damage is caused, although in some cases one is not liable for the full extent of the damage. Also, with regard to these primary categories, one who took standard precautionary measures to prevent damage from occurring is exempt from liability.", 
                "An additional primary category of damage, Man, includes damage caused directly by a person. One is liable for any damage that is a direct result of his actions or his force. One bears an extensive level of responsibility for his actions and therefore is liable for the full cost of the damage even if it was caused unwittingly and without awareness. The only exceptions to this are damage caused by those of limited intellectual capacity, who in general are not responsible for their actions, and damage caused by one's Canaanite slaves. In the latter case, the exemption applies to the master and is the result of an enactment for the betterment of the world, as it prevents a slave from maliciously causing damage in order to cause his owner great loss. The slave himself, if he is emancipated, will then be liable to pay for the damage he caused.", 
                "The second section of <span class=\"it-text\">Bava Kamma</span> deals with damage caused by one person to another and by one person to the property of another. This topic is generally subdivided into the laws of bodily injury and the laws of robbery and theft.", 
                "As the Gemara derives from verses in the Torah, one that injures another is liable for one or more of five types of indemnity payments. These are the payments:", 
                "Cost of the damage:<span class=\"it-text\"> </span>For all types of irreversible harm, such as severing an arm or a leg, which reduces the injured party's market value.", 
                "Pain: For pain inflicted.", 
                "Humiliation: For embarrassment caused by the injury that was inflicted, such as in the rape of a woman or by causing a blemish that humiliates the person.", 
                "Medical expenses: For all medical expenses incurred as a consequence of the injury.", 
                "Loss of livelihood: For missed work and loss of income due to the injury.", 
                "These indemnities are not automatically paid for every injury caused; rather, each case is judged individually. At times one may have to pay all five types of indemnity payments, and at other times one may have to pay only some of them. Here too, there is a distinction between one who injured another willfully and purposefully, who is liable to pay all five indemnity payments when they apply, and one who injured another unintentionally or because of neglect, who is liable to pay only for the cost of the damage<span class=\"it-text\"> </span>but not the other four types.", 
                "Injuring another person is a violation of a Torah prohibition although one is rarely punished with lashes for doing so. Accordingly, one who injures another is required not only to compensate the injured party, but he must make amends by placating him as well.", 
                "Robbery and theft differ from cases of damage in that not only does the victim suffer a loss, but the perpetrator benefits from the property he took. The talmudic discussion about this concerns two central issues.", 
                "First, the fines imposed by the Torah on the thief, and to a lesser degree, on the robber, obligate him to make a double payment to the victim of his crime, and in cases where the crime of theft is followed by the slaughtering or sale of the stolen ox or sheep, he is required to pay four or five times the value of the stolen animal. Because these payments are fines leveled by the Torah, only a court of ordained judges, an institution that lapsed over the course of time, is authorized to collect them. Even then, the fine is imposed only in limited circumstances. For example, guilt must be confirmed on the basis of testimony from two witnesses and not based on a confession of the guilty party, and in some cases a fine is imposed only after the guilty party has taken a false oath that he is not guilty.", 
                "The second issue involves the requirement for the thief and the robber to return the item that they stole or to pay restitution for its value. Should they not do so willingly, the court is authorized to coerce them. The Gemara enters into a detailed discussion as it attempts to define this obligation. When are a robber and a thief obligated to return the very item they stole and when are they required only to pay restitution? How is the amount one has to pay determined in cases where the value of the item changed over time? Is there a difference in this regard if the change was due to fluctuations in the item's market value or due to a physical change in the item itself?", 
                "How the stolen item should be returned is also the subject of much discussion. Can he just return the item to its owner or must he inform him that he has done so? To what lengths does he need to go to find the owner? The Sages enacted that in order to facilitate a thief's full repentance he does not always need to return the item itself. It needs to be clarified when that enactment applies and when it does not apply. Furthermore, is the requirement to return the item an obligation on the thief alone, or does the victim retain rights of ownership to the item so that even if the thief dies he may continue to claim it back from the thief's heirs?", 
                "These are the principal discussions contained in this tractate, although <span class=\"it-text\">Bava Kamma</span> also includes discussions about other types of payments and fines as well as false claims made with regard to instances of theft and robbery. Very little aggadic material appears in this tractate, and what does appear is mainly related to the tractate's primary subject, the responsibility one bears for the damage he caused.", 
                "Tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Bava Kamma</span> contains ten chapters. Some chapters deal with a single subject, while others address several.",

                "Chapter Three expands on damage in the category of Pit. It also addresses cases in which two people caused damage to each other, as well as cases where one cannot determine with certainty who is the one that caused the damage and who is the one that was damaged.", 
                "Chapter Four covers the subject of an ox that gored, including what defines whether an animal is considered to be innocuous or forewarned. It also contains a discussion of the forms of restitution payments and a case in which an ox kills a person.",

At its conclusion, the chapter lists the enactments that were promulgated concerning Eretz Yisrael and Jerusalem.",

One is not liable to pay for having caused humiliation alone, despite having violated a grave prohibition. With regard to certain actions causing humiliation, the Sages established a set sum to be paid, while with others the court decides upon the amount. When determining the sum to be paid, various factors are taken into consideration, such as the stature of the people involved and the place where the event occurred. ",

But if the ox was a goring ox in time past, and warning has been given to its owner, and he has not secured it, and it killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death. If a ransom is placed upon him, then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatsoever is placed upon him. Whether it has gored a son or has gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done to him. If the ox gores a slave or a maidservant, he shall give to their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned. (Exodus 21:28–32)",

                "This chapter, which serves as a general introduction to the principles of damage caused by one's property, addresses one's liability to pay restitution in cases of damage. The chapter delineates in which cases one is exempt and in which cases he is liable, and the extent of his liability; in some cases one is liable to pay the full cost of the damage and in others only half the cost of the damage. Included is a discussion of when the location of the damaged item is a factor in determining one's liability. Also considered is the form of payment, the way in which the cost of the damage is appraised, and how the payment is collected.", 
                "The opening discussion in this chapter concerns the four primary categories of damage. The cases presented in the Torah are paradigms from which the principles defining these primary categories are derived.", 
                "The Torah differentiates between two forms of payment that one can pay for damage caused. The first is a payment of restitution worth the full cost of the damage. The one liable for the damage makes the payment from the “best of his field” (Exodus 22:4). The other form is a payment of half the cost of the damage, which is made from the proceeds of the sale of the body of the belligerent animal. The chapter addresses the precise meaning of paying restitution from the “best of his field”: How is this accomplished, and what is done in cases where it is not possible to do so?", 
                "Another issue considered is in which cases one is liable to pay the full cost of the damage and in which cases one pays for only half the cost of the damage. Accompanying this is a discussion of whether the payment of half the cost of the damage is considered to be monetary restitution or a fine imposed by the Torah.",

The Gemara also tangentially covers the subject of the payment for damage caused by a person willfully or due to negligence on his part."

                "It has been established that one must pay for any damage caused as a result of his actions or of his failure to properly safeguard his property.", 
                "Liability to pay restitution is incurred only when the damage is caused to the property of a Jew, but not in the case of damage caused to ownerless property or property belonging to a gentile, or to property that was consecrated to the Temple.", 
                "Generally, the one liable for the damage pays restitution for the full cost of the damage, and he pays from his best-quality land. An exception to this principle is damage caused by an animal that was innocuous but nevertheless caused damage with destructive intent, i.e., damage in the category of Goring. In that case, the owner is liable to pay for only half the cost of the damage, and the payment is made from the proceeds of the sale of the body of the belligerent animal. Similarly, the owner of the animal is liable to pay only half the cost of the damage caused by pebbles inadvertently propelled by the foot of his animal as it was walking. The Gemara considered the nature of these payments and concluded that the payment of half the cost of the damage in the case of the innocuous animal is considered to be a fine, whereas the payment for damage caused by pebbles is considered to be a reduced form of monetary restitution. Since the former is considered a fine, the various <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of fines apply, most significantly that one does not pay based on one's own admission; rather, one pays based only on the testimony of witnesses.", 
                "The primary categories of damage can be enumerated in various ways. The Gemara cited one opinion whose list included twenty-four different categories, most of them being forms of damage caused directly or indirectly by a person. On the whole, the discussion in this chapter was limited to damage caused by one's property, which may be divided into the following primary categories:", 
                "Goring: This includes all forms of damage caused by an animal where the intention was to cause damage, and doing so was a departure from its typical behavior. This includes goring, biting, and kicking. Liability for such damage is incurred for damage both on private property and in a public domain, although there is a distinction between a case where the animal was innocuous and where it was forewarned.", 
                "Eating: The essential characteristics of Eating are that the damage is caused through the normal actions of the animal and the animal derived pleasure from his actions. This includes consuming a person's produce, or rubbing itself up against a wall for its pleasure. Liability for this damage is limited to damage caused to property within the injured party's private property. Accordingly, if an animal consumed someone's produce in the public domain, its owner is exempt.", 
                "Trampling: This refers to any damage resulting from the animal's normal movement, including treading on items while it walks or other forms of damage resulting from its normal motions, such as knocking items over and breaking them as it passes. Also in these cases, liability is limited to damage caused to property within the injured party's private property.", 
                "Pit: The classic case of this mentioned in the Torah is one who digs a pit on property that does not belong to him and people or animals are damaged by falling into it. This category also includes the creation of any public hazard, such as placing an obstacle in the public domain, although the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of when such acts are classified as Pit is subject to a dispute among the <span class=\"it-text\">amora'im</span>. One who creates the hazard is liable to pay damages for any injury caused to an animal or a person, but he is exempt from liability in a case in which damage was caused to vessels or in a case in which a person was killed.", 
                "Fire: One who lights a fire that spreads and causes damage, or who sets in motion any other type of obstacle that causes damage to others while in motion, is liable to pay the full cost of the damage. Liability is incurred irrespective of whether it occurred on the injured party's private property or in the public domain.", 
                "As mentioned, for damage of the category of Goring only, a distinction exists between an innocuous and a forewarned animal. Until an animal has repeatedly caused damage and has been warned for doing so, it is considered to be innocuous. Accordingly, if an innocuous animal causes damage it is considered to be an aberration, and so the owner is liable for only half the cost of the damage. Once the animal has been forewarned, the owner is required to pay for the full cost of any subsequent damage. For all other categories of damage, since the damage is caused by the animal's typical behavior, the animal is deemed to be forewarned even if it had never previously caused damage of that form. Accordingly, the owner is liable to pay the full cost of the damage even the first time it causes that form of damage."

                "The Sages said that the Torah is not as stringent with the requirements for safeguarding with regard to Eating and Trampling as it is with regard to Goring. For this reason, if one puts his animal in a safe enclosure that is locked properly, and yet the animal emerges and causes damage, he is exempt from liability. In such cases the owner pays only for the value of his own benefit from the damage, e.g., the money he saved by not having to feed the animal. He is not required to pay compensation for the damage caused.", 
                "In terms of the amount of compensation paid for damage, if the animal ate unripe produce, the damage is assessed relative to an area sixty times larger than the area that was damaged. The amount for which one is liable is the prior value of the larger area less the current value of that larger area. This is the assessment whether the animal damaged a part of a field, a tree, a bush, or any produce that has not fully ripened. If the animal damaged ripe produce, the compensation is simply the value of the produce that was damaged.", 
                "In general, one is liable for acts of damage classified as Eating only if that damage occurred in private property belonging to another. Nevertheless, if one gave permission to another to store produce in his field, the owner of the field is liable if his animal damages that produce.", 
                "Tangential to the discussion of damages, the Gemara cited several instances in which one is exempt according to human laws but liable according to the laws of Heaven. Although, for technical reasons, the court does not obligate one to pay compensation for these kinds of damage, there is nevertheless a moral imperative to pay for the damage. One who does not pay for causing damage in instances such as these is considered evil both in the eyes of Heaven and in the eyes of others.", 
                "The main topic of this chapter is acts of damage classified as Fire. One who kindles a fire and does not adequately safeguard it is liable to pay for the damage caused. This is the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha </span>whether an item is destroyed completely, singed, or damaged in any other way due to the fire. An act of damage classified as Fire has a unique exemption: One is not liable for damage caused to items that are hidden from view. This exemption applies to items concealed within a stack of grain in a field and to similar cases. Despite this, if one's fire destroys the home of another, he must pay full compensation for everything contained within it that is common to keep there. This latter principle applies not only to an act of damage classified as Fire, but to any damage caused to items that it is common to keep in that location.", 
                "The Torah is lenient with the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of an act of damage classified as Fire, and provided one safeguards his fire adequately, he is not liable for damage caused. Therefore, one who kindles a fire within his own property and exercises all due caution, distancing it appropriately from the borders of his property or ensuring that a fence, body of water, or empty space separates the fire from anything that it could potentially damage, is not liable to pay compensation for damage caused.", 
                "In a case where there is liability for damage caused by a fire, the one who caused the fire to spread is liable for the damage. If there were several partners involved in kindling the fire, the one who is the proximate cause is liable. For example, if an animal caused a previously controlled fire to blaze beyond control and cause damage, the owner of the animal is liable.", 
                "If one appoints a halakhically<span class=\"it-text\"> </span>competent agent to kindle a fire on his behalf, the agent is liable for any damage subsequently caused. If the agent is not halakhically competent, the one who designated him is exempt according to human laws but liable according to the laws of Heaven.

Another discussion pertains to one who was forced to aid others in confiscating property from a third party.",

For instance, craftsmen often receive raw materials from a customer and use them to produce a finished product. During this process, some of the raw materials may become separated or are left over. When can the artisan take these materials for himself, based on the assumption that this is part of his agreement with his customer? Similarly, when can it be assumed that workers or family members have a right to possess certain items?

Then it shall be, if he has sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he took by robbery, or the thing that he has gotten by oppression, or the deposit that was deposited with him, or the lost thing that he found. Or anything about which he has sworn falsely, he shall restore it in full, and shall add the fifth part more to it; unto him to whom it appertains shall he give it, in the day of his being guilty. And he shall bring his forfeit unto the Lord, a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to the valuation, for a guilt-offering, unto the priest. And the priest shall make atonement for him before the Lord, and he shall be forgiven, concerning whatsoever he does so as to be guilty thereby. (Leviticus 5:20–26)",

But if the man have no kinsman to whom restitution may be made for the guilt, the restitution for guilt that is made shall be the Lord's, even the priest's; besides the ram of the atonement, whereby atonement shall be made for him. (Numbers 5:5–7)", 
                "In order to fulfill the obligation detailed in these verses in its most straightforward manner, a robber must return the actual item stolen to the robbery victim. If a stolen item has remained in the possession of the robber for an extended period of time, many practical questions arise: What should the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> be if the stolen item underwent a significant change? Does the robber consequently acquire the stolen item and become liable to pay monetary restitution? What type of change in the item is deemed significant? Additionally, is it sufficient for the robber to return the stolen item, or must the robber also reimburse the robbery victim for his use of the stolen item during the time it was in his possession? What is the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> in a case where the stolen item did not undergo any physical change, but something has happened to reduce or eliminate its value in a manner that is not evident, e.g., a change in the legal or halakhic status of the stolen item?",

What happens if a craftsman produces a product that is not according to the agreement he entered into with the owner? Is he considered a type of a robber, who acquires the item or materials given to him, in which case he must reimburse the owner with money? Or does the owner retain what he originally owned, while the craftsman must pay compensation calculated in some other manner?", 
                "In addition to the monetary obligation that a robber must pay restitution to the robbery victim, there is also a requirement that he atone for committing the sin of robbery. The Gemara discusses a robber who compounded his sin by taking a false oath that he did not in fact commit the robbery, and the means by which he can achieve atonement. He must return the principal value of the stolen item, pay an additional one-fifth penalty, and bring a guilt-offering, known as the guilt-offering for robbery. In this chapter, the Gemara discusses the circumstances in which the robber must pay the additional one-fifth.

                "Continuing a discussion in the previous chapter about compensation, this chapter concludes that in a situation of uncertainty with regard to the measure of liability of one who causes damage, one follows the principle that the burden of proof rests upon the claimant. Based on this, if an ox gores a pregnant cow and a dead fetus is subsequently found at its side, the owner of the cow must bring proof that the miscarriage was directly caused by the goring in order to receive compensation. Similarly, if an innocuous pregnant cow gored, although the fetus is considered to be part of the cow that caused damage, payment is not collected from the proceeds of the sale of the fetus unless proof is brought that the cow was still pregnant at the time of the goring.", 
                "Another topic explored in this chapter concerns one who brought his own animal or a movable item into the courtyard of another, and damage was caused either to the animal who entered the courtyard, or to the owner of the courtyard. In this case, the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> is that the owner of the courtyard is not responsible for safeguarding the property of one who enters his courtyard unless he obligates himself to do so. Similarly, one who enters another's property with permission is not responsible for damage caused to the property of the owner of the courtyard unless he obligates himself to this effect. If damage is caused by an animal through goring, eating, or trampling, or if the animal itself is injured, if the one responsible for the damage explicitly obligated himself to compensate the other for it, he must do so. If he had not explicitly obligated himself, he is exempt from liability. If one entered another's courtyard without permission and damage was caused, the owner of the courtyard is exempt from liability for damage caused by his property; but the one who entered without permission is responsible for any damage caused by his possessions. All of these <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> apply only to damage caused by property. By contrast, one who causes damage himself is liable, unless it was completely accidental.", 
                "Another topic raised in the Gemara concerns compensation paid for miscarried offspring. The <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> is that this payment is not applicable unless an individual intended to injure his friend and instead struck a pregnant woman, causing her to miscarry. The compensation for miscarried offspring is generally given to the father of the fetus even if he is not married to the mother at that time. If the father dies, the money is given to his heirs. In a case where he has no heirs, such as in the case of a convert, the one responsible for the damage does not have to pay damages.",

The digger of a pit is liable for damage caused by it if he dug the pit on property that does not belong to him and if he did not cover or seal it properly. The Sages had a tradition stating that a pit must be a minimum of ten handbreadths deep in order for the pit's owner to be liable for the death of any animals that fall inside. If the pit was partially filled with water, the owner is liable even if the pit is less than ten handbreadths deep. No minimum measurement exists with regard to the digger's responsibility for injuries caused by the pit, and the digger would consequently be liable in every case. Excluding depth, there is no specific form or structure that determines liability. Any hole dug in the ground with the minimum depth of ten handbreadths qualifies as a pit.", 
                "In a case where a death occurs due to a pit, one is liable only for animals, not for people, that die. Even concerning animals, the owner is liable only if the death occurred at specific times, such as at night; or if it occurred with specific animals, such as a very young animal or one of substandard intelligence for its species; or if the pit's covering was insufficiently strong for that particular animal and as a result it fell into the pit. Although the owner of the pit is liable for damage caused to animals and humans, he is not liable for damage caused to vessels, including those that were attached to the animals at the time of the fall.", 
                "With regard to the reason for liability for damage that occurs in a pit, it is concluded that liability stems from both the actual impact of hitting the ground as well as from the exposure to fumes during the fall itself.", 
                "One who digs a pit or owns the pit has responsibility for covering a pit properly, and he is liable for damage incurred. If the pit is owned jointly by two partners, if each one individually dug a part of the pit in a manner that was sufficient to cause damage, both of them are liable. If the damage was caused because the pit was not covered appropriately, the last partner who attended to the pit is responsible.", 
                "The Gemara used this last discussion as a springboard to describe other scenarios where damage is caused by multiple parties. For example, in the case of an ox that pushes another ox into a pit, the Gemara concluded that the owner of the belligerent ox and the owner of the pit are considered to be liable. Concerning compensation, the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> is that if one of the partners cannot pay, the entire sum is collected from the other partner.", 
                "Although the Torah mentions specifically an ox or donkey that falls into a pit, the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha </span>applies to any animal. In fact, it is stated that the principle that all animals are included in a <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>, even if the Torah mentioned specific animals, applies to many other areas of <span class=\"it-text\">halakha </span>as well, such as animals working on Shabbat, the mitzva of returning lost items, unloading or loading an animal with a heavy burden, and the prohibition of diverse kinds.

If the pregnant cow is gored, then the question becomes whether the fetus has the status of the mother with regard to estimating the value of the damage. In both cases, this may depend on the status of the fetus at the time of the goring, i.e., whether it already emerged from the womb, or if the cow miscarried at that time.", 
                "The second issue explored in this chapter is a more general one, involving what happens when one brings his animal into another's property and it does damage or is damaged there. In this case, the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> depends on whether the animal enters with permission. The questions posed relate to whether granting an animal's owner permission for the animal to enter one's property causes the property owner to be responsible for any damage that might occur to that animal, as well as whether the animal's owner is responsible for preventing his animal from doing damage.", 
                "Based on the discussions about Goring, the Gemara goes on to analyze a <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> that is not directly related to the case of a pregnant cow: The Torah requires one who injures a pregnant woman, causing her to miscarry, to pay the husband compensation for the miscarried offspring. What is the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> when an ox gores a woman and causes a miscarriage? The Gemara enumerates a number of details with regard to these circumstances, such as when one must pay, whom he pays, how the value of the compensation is assessed, and what the other payments are that the one who causes damage must pay.", 
                "After this chapter addresses the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of Goring, the bulk of it deals with the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of Pit, which were not comprehensively detailed in previous chapters. The Mishna and Gemara elaborate on a number of different facets of Pit that are only briefly mentioned in the Torah, for instance, the definition of what constitutes a pit are clarified, including its form and depth. Similarly, the issues of ownership and location of the pit are discussed, in addition to the question of whether one who digs a pit must have some element of ownership over the area in which the pit is found in order to be liable for damage caused or whether he is liable irrespective of his ownership of the property. The chapter also addresses a fundamental question concerning the nature of the damage classified as Pit: Does the damage occur due to the impact of hitting the ground, although the ground is not the property of the one who digs the pit? Or is the damage due to the animal's exposure to fumes when falling into the pit, which is unrelated to the impact with the ground?", 
                "The Torah requires that a pit be covered. Therefore, the definition of a covering that exempts the owner from liability must be clarified. A related question this chapter explores concerns the status of a pit jointly owned by multiple partners, and how to divide the payment of damages between them.", 
                "Yet another issue examined in this chapter is the type of damage the owner of the pit is liable to pay for. Is he liable to pay for any type of damage or only for damage caused to animals? If the latter, are only the animals listed explicitly by the Torah included, or are those specific cases expanded to include other types of animals as well?", 
                "In addition to these issues, the Gemara also explains a number of other points that are not directly related to the main themes of the tractate."

                "When a stolen item undergoes an irreversible change while in the possession of the robber, he becomes its owner and is henceforth liable to return only the monetary value it possessed at the time of the robbery. The Gemara concludes, contrary to the opinion of several Sages, that the robber is obligated to return only the stolen item or its monetary value, but is not obligated to give the owner the profits that he accrued while using it during the time it was in his possession.", 
                "If during the time the robber possessed the stolen item it underwent a change that is not physically evident, but that reduced or negated its value, such as leavened bread stolen before Passover over which Passover elapsed, rendering it prohibited for any Jew to derive benefit from it, or stolen coins that are taken out of circulation by the government while in the robber's possession, the robber nevertheless fulfills his obligation if he returns the item as is. If the robber is unable to return it, he pays the monetary value of the stolen item at the time of the robbery.", 
                "The Gemara rules that skilled workers hired to manufacture or repair an item who ruin it or diverge from the owner's stated desire are considered akin to robbers. Consequently, they acquire the item and incur liability to pay the owner the monetary value of the raw materials he gave to them, at the time that he gave them.", 
                "One who robs another person, denies it, and takes a false oath to that effect does not achieve atonement for this sin until he returns the stolen item to the owner, even if that requires great effort. To ease this burden and encourage repentance, the Sages instituted an ordinance whereby a repentant robber may return the stolen item to the owner via an agent of the court or of the owner.", 
                "The robber is also obligated to give the owner an additional one-fifth of the value of the stolen item. Failure to pay the additional amount does not preclude atonement, but failure to give the principal does. This one-fifth payment liability is imposed on account of the robber taking a false oath denying culpability. If he subsequently takes additional false oaths denying culpability, he is liable for an additional one-fifth payment for each false oath. Additionally, the robber must bring a guilt-offering, but he cannot achieve atonement by means of the guilt-offering until he has paid the principal to the owner.", 
                "If a robber does not remember from whom he robbed and several parties claim to have been the robbery victim, he fulfills his obligation to Heaven only when he pays each of them.", 
                "If one robs a convert who then dies without heirs, the robber must pay the value of the stolen item and an additional one-fifth to the priests whose priestly watch is performing the Temple service at the time he ascends to Jerusalem to pay restitution, and only thereafter may he bring his guilt-offering and achieve atonement. He should give both the money and the guilt-offering to the priests serving at that time, but if he gave the money to the priests serving at that time and the guilt-offering to the following priestly watch, he still fulfills his obligation and achieves atonement. By contrast, if he first gave the guilt-offering to the priests serving at that time and then gave the money to the subsequent priestly watch, he does not fulfill his obligation and does not achieve atonement until he returns and gives the money and the guilt-offering in the proper order."

The ruling in such a case is that the last damaged party receives the entire amount that he deserves, namely, half the value of the belligerent ox. Since each damaged party becomes a partner in the ownership of the ox, the next most recently damaged party receives half of what remains of the ox's value. Similarly, the damaged party prior to that receives half of what then remains and so forth.", 
                "The Gemara ruled that a forewarned ox is not considered hazardous at all times and for all purposes but only for those types of behavior for which it was rendered forewarned. For example, if it was rendered forewarned for goring a certain species of animal, or at a specific time, it is considered forewarned only with regard to that species or that time, and it retains its innocuous status with regard to other cases.", 
                "There are exceptions to the standard <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of compensation for Goring. If an animal consecrated to the Temple causes damage, the Temple treasury is exempt, as is a person whose ox gores a consecrated animal. A gentile who is tried under the jurisdiction of a Jewish court is liable to pay the full cost of the damage caused by his ox, even if it was innocuous; whereas if a Jew's ox gores a gentile's ox, the Jew is exempt from liability. One who is halakhically incompetent is not liable to pay compensation for damage caused by his ox. To protect society, the court appoints a steward to safeguard this person's animals, and consequently, if they cause damage, compensation can be collected.",

An ox that kills a person unintentionally is also not killed.",

If it has an owner, its verdict is issued only in his presence. Once the verdict is issued, it is prohibited to derive benefit from the ox.", 
                "The chapter concludes with a return to its discussion of damage caused by an ox. Although the owner of an ox is liable to pay for damage it causes, if he entrusts it to a bailee, the latter accepts this responsibility and is liable to pay for damage the ox causes, whereas the owner is exempt from liability. If a forewarned ox was safeguarded adequately, the owner is exempt from paying damages. With regard to an innocuous ox the Torah requires superior safeguarding; otherwise the owner is liable."

                "The first concerns one who creates an obstacle in the public domain or one who becomes an obstacle himself. A central element of this analysis is whether all obstacles are judged under the category of Pit, or whether certain obstacles are treated differently. One fundamental question is whether or not one is responsible for an obstacle he creates unintentionally or due to circumstances beyond his control.", 
                "The second situation concerns a case where two people collide and one causes injury to the other. The liability in this case depends on the answer to several questions: To what degree must one take precautions so as not to cause injury or damage to others? Is one who is sufficiently careful exempt from liability for any damage he causes? Is a pedestrian obligated to watch for obstacles in the road?", 
                "The Gemara then examines how damages are calculated in a situation of mutual injury caused between two people, between a person and an animal, or between two animals that collide. With regard to injury caused by an animal, a major factor in calculating payment for damage is whether the animal is innocuous or forewarned. Subsequently, the chapter compares one's liability for damage he himself causes with damage his animal causes. Last, the chapter describes what happens in a situation where an animal causes an injury, and its identity is uncertain or disputed.", 
                "In many of these discussions, the Gemara examines the practical <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> through analyzing relevant verses and exploring the underlying concepts involved, specifically in relation to the primary categories of Pit and Goring."

At times this can lead to a cancellation of the monetary obligations incurred through the theft itself. Another question is whether the testimony of two separate sets of witnesses, one concerning the theft of an animal and the other its slaughter or sale, can be combined into a single incriminating testimony.

One who informs gentiles of the whereabouts of another's property to facilitate its seizure is considered to be a robber unless he was coerced into doing so. Furthermore, if the informer enabled the gentiles to access the property by performing an action, he is liable even if he acted under coercion. One who had his own possessions replaced with another's by bandits is permitted to keep them due to the presumption that their owner has despaired of retrieving his belongings. If one unwittingly purchased stolen property and the owner recognizes the items as his own, he may take the items from the purchaser, but he must compensate him for the money that the purchaser innocently spent on those items.", 
                "The Gemara also examined the rights and limitations of one who handles another's property with the permission of the owner and the ramifications for potential purchasers. It is generally assumed that the trivial, leftover parts of a repaired item may be kept by craftsmen, as it may be presumed that they are of little interest to the customer. Accordingly, it is permitted to purchase these items from craftsmen. Similarly, it is permitted to purchase small items from women and children, as it is reasonable to assume they are offering them with the approval of their husbands or fathers. As a general guideline, if merchandise is being sold by employees or family members in a public, conspicuous fashion or in large quantities, it may be presumed that they are being sold with the owner's permission, and one may therefore purchase it. If the buyer is asked to conceal his purchase, it is prohibited for him to engage in the transaction as there is reason to question its legality. The halakhic criteria that define what is considered trivial or significant in this context are largely based on the prevailing social conventions of a particular community."

One of these is the extent to which the owner of the animal is liable. Is he required to pay in every case, or is he exempt if he has safeguarded his animal adequately? What is considered adequate safeguarding of an animal? Similarly, the Gemara discusses whether or not he can pass the responsibility for safeguarding an animal to another.",

If an animal eats or tramples a particular item, it is clear how much damage was caused. But if an animal tramples part of a field in which the produce is not yet fully grown, there are several possible ways of assessing the damage caused. Is the value of the trampled furrow assessed in isolation or as part of the entire field? Is it assessed by the current value of the crop or by its future potential value?", 
                "With regard to damage caused by Fire, there are several issues that require investigation. Since fire is not a possession, it is clear that the liability for damage lies with the one who caused the fire. At times, it can be difficult to determine who that person is, as in a case where many people together create a fire or where one person instructs another to transport fire, either as a coal or as a torch. The Gemara must also determine liability when the wind causes the damage by blowing fire.",

There is also a <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> learned through tradition, supported by most of the <span class=\"it-text\">tanna'im</span>, that one is liable to compensate the injured party only for items that were visible, e.g., the stack of grain and standing grain mentioned in the verse (Exodus 22:5). One is not liable to compensate him for items that were concealed and that were subsequently destroyed by fire. With regard to this tradition, the Gemara asks whether it applies in every case or only in cases of negligence.

Since compensation is paid exclusively from proceeds of the sale of the belligerent ox, in a case where several animals were injured or killed, the proceeds must be divided among their owners. The manner in which the compensation is divided depends on the definition of the damaged parties' rights to the belligerent ox; is it considered a partnership between the owner and the damaged parties, or is it considered a debt, to which the ox is liened?",

The definition of a forewarned ox is clarified; once an ox is established as forewarned, is it considered forewarned with regard to goring and causing all forms of damage, at all times, and with regard to all targets, or is it considered forewarned only with regard to those for which it has an established pattern of belligerent behavior? Another issue is whether and when a forewarned ox can revert to its former status of innocuousness.",

Issues that require clarification are whether or not this applies to an ox that kills a person unintentionally, and whether the age or sex of the victim is of any consequence. There is also a discussion here as to whether the Torah's explicit mention of the ox's owner indicates that an ox that is not owned by a specific person is not killed.",

The purpose of this ransom is investigated: Is it in order to compensate the victim's family or to atone for the owner? The manner in which the ransom is calculated is discussed as well. The chapter investigates whether or not the owner is liable to pay the victim's monetary value to his family, in a case where he is exempt from paying ransom, e.g., where the ox was innocuous.

Is it correct to say that in general, there is a principle that it is the responsibility of the one who has the potential to cause damage to distance himself from another's property or person in order to ensure that he avoids causing damage, or does an individual generally have the right to do as he pleases on his own property, and it is the neighbor's responsibility to distance himself if he is likely to sustain damage? This leads to a further issue: If one distances his activities from his neighbor so as not to cause damage, is he entitled to compensation, or is he simply fulfilling an obligation for which he does not receive payment? Yet another dilemma concerns a case where one took precautions to avoid causing damage to another, and nevertheless his activity damaged his neighbor's property.

And you shall speak to the children of Israel, saying: If a man dies, and has no son, then you shall pass his inheritance to his daughter. And if he has no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers. And if he has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his father's brothers. And if his father has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it. And it shall be to the children of Israel a statute of judgment, as the Lord commanded Moses. (Numbers 27:6–11)", 
                "If a man has two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated, and they have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son is hers that was hated; then it shall be, in the day that he causes his sons to inherit that which he has, that he may not make the son of the beloved the firstborn before the son of the hated, who is the firstborn; but he shall acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he has; because he is the first fruits of his strength, the right of the firstborn is his. (Deuteronomy 21:15–17)", 
                "The topic of this chapter is inheritance. Although the Torah delineates who a person's heirs are and the order in which the inheritance is apportioned, several details, e.g., a husband's right to inherit from his wife, and whether an heir's heir inherits in a case where the heir is already dead, are not explicit and are inferred by the Talmud from the verses. In addition, the chapter examines whether an inheritor can deviate from the Torah's laws of inheritance by bequeathing his property to other people. Even if it is possible to do so, the question remains as to whether or when it is appropriate.", 
                "An additional issue is primogeniture, a firstborn son's right to a double portion of the inheritance. The chapter analyzes the definition of a firstborn in this regard, whether a firstborn receives a double portion only of his father's inheritance or whether he receives a double portion of his mother's inheritance as well, and whether he receives a double portion of the entire inheritance or only of a certain part of it.", 
                "The chapter also discusses a father's credibility in identifying a person as his child or as his firstborn son, thereby including him in the inheritance.", 
                "Besides one's heirs, there are others who have the right to collect from an estate debts or monetary obligations after the death of the owner. For example, a widow has the right to collect her marriage contract or money for her sustenance. The relationship between these collectors and the heirs is discussed in this chapter and the next.", 
                "Another aspect of inheritance involves a situation where the inheritance has not yet been divided between the heirs and remains the common property of the sons or daughters. The Talmud discusses the management of the property in this case, i.e., the rights and obligations of each partner."

This is the case when the seller specified a precise measurement of land, but if he said: Approximately a <span class=\"it-text\">beit kor</span>, or made a similar statement, then even crevices and rocks are measured as part of the field, as he did not commit himself to a precise measurement. Even when the rocks and crevices are measured along with the field, this applies only when specific conditions related to their location and concentration are met. If the rocks are few but they are arranged in formations that make working the land difficult, such as in a circle, a triangle, a zigzag shape, or the like, the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> is uncertain, and the principle invoked is that the burden of proof rests upon the claimant.", 
                "The wording of the deed of sale is also significant in cases where the actual measurements of the field are not precisely as stipulated between the parties. If it was emphasized that the area was to be measured with a rope, i.e., precisely, then even if the difference is minimal, the buyer must return the surplus to the seller or the seller must deduct the difference from the purchase price. But if a measurement was mentioned without specification, and all the more so if the parties added the words: More or less, then if the discrepancy is less than one part in twenty-four, the sale is valid as is. The precise <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> as to how to compensate the injured party in the case of a discrepancy depends on the specific details of each case.", 
                "One who sells half of his field to another person gives him land worth half the value of the entire field, and that land can be given to the buyer from the leaner part of the field. If he specified the side of the field he was selling, such as the northern or southern side, he gives him land on that side worth half the value of the entire field.", 
                "All of the above applies when the seller sells a tract of land without specifying its borders. But if he sold a specific area within certain demarcations and borders, the buyer receives the demarcated area, and if the discrepancy between the actual size of the field and the size stipulated by the seller does not exceed one-sixth, the sale is valid as is. If the discrepancy is greater than one-sixth, the party who benefited must return the surplus.", 
                "With regard to the general issue of contradictory expressions in a sale agreement, the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> is that if the contradictory expressions cannot be resolved, the less inclusive expression is followed, as the holder of the deed of sale is at a disadvantage.", 
                "In the course of its discussion of errors in the assessment and evaluation of property, the Gemara considers several issues pertaining to erroneous assessments, including what margin of error is accepted, and when a division of property that is based on an erroneous assessment is voided. In this context, the Gemara examines issues concerning brothers who divide their father's estate between them."

                "This chapter examined cases in which one performs an activity on his own property and thereby causes damage to his neighbor. With regard to damage inflicted upon a neighbor, the <span class=\"it-text CharOverride-1\">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei that the responsibility to distance oneself is not on the one whose activities might cause damage to his neighbor. Consequently, one who performs an activity on his own property that might cause damage to another at a later stage is not required to take steps to avoid this scenario. This principle applies only if the damage he inflicts is indirect. If the damage occurs immediately, or it begins to take effect immediately and its effects gradually increase, it is considered as though he has shot his neighbor with his arrows, and the neighbor can object to his activity. This applies to damage that is caused by one's actions to the neighbor's property, e.g., his walls, pit, and various plantings on his property, as well as damage that is caused by noise or foul odors. Similarly, if one plants trees and the like whose roots or branches extend into his neighbor's property and potentially cause damage, that neighbor is entitled to chop them down as necessary.", 
                "The Sages established certain limits within which the damaged party may compel a neighbor to distance the source of the damage from his private or jointly owned property. If one did distance these activities from a neighbor, he is nevertheless still liable for any damage he may cause.", 
                "Neighbors who live in the same courtyard can prevent one another from performing an activity that will lead to an increase in visitors to the courtyard, whether their objection is due to the noise or simply because they do not want crowds passing through their property. This right to protest applies only to visitors who will enter the outdoor area of the courtyard. If one wishes to work within the confines of his own home, the neighbors cannot prevent him from doing so even if his activity is noisy.", 
                "As neighbors and residents of the same courtyard can prevent someone from causing them damage, this applies all the more so to residents of a town that are suffering from the acts of a private individual. The rights of the public in this regard include the removal of stumbling blocks, items that interfere with traffic, and articles that spread ritual impurity, and imposing restrictions on activities that discharge foul odors into the city. Likewise, the residents can prevent an individual from spoiling the city landscape. The community can cut down interfering trees and the like, even if the owner originally planted them in a permitted manner. Furthermore, in a case of uncertainty the public can remove such obstructions without having to pay compensation.",

Precedence is granted to one's offspring, i.e., to one's sons or daughters and their descendants. If a man has no descendants, his paternal family members inherit from him, starting with his father, and if his father is deceased then his father's descendants inherit from him. If his father has no descendants, the inheritance goes to his paternal grandfather and his descendants, or to his paternal great-grandfather and his descendants, and so forth. In all cases, sons and their descendants precede daughters and their descendants.",

Although there are different opinions as to whether a husband's inheritance of his wife's property is by Torah or rabbinic law, even those who hold that it is by rabbinic law concede that it takes precedence over that of other heirs.", 
                "In principle, an heir does not lose his right to the inheritance after his death; if the heir is dead, his heirs receive it. Nevertheless, a husband does not inherit property inherited by his wife after her death, nor do brothers inherit property inherited by their brother after his death.", 
                "A firstborn son receives a double portion of the property his father possessed at the time of his death, but not of the property that was due to be paid to the deceased. He does not receive a double portion of his mother's inheritance. The definition of a firstborn is a son who is the first viable offspring of his father. Whether he is his mother's firstborn is immaterial. If the firstborn was born by caesarean section, he does not receive a double share, nor does the following son. If there are twins, the midwife's attestation at the time of their birth as to which baby was born first is deemed credible. The mother's testimony during the first seven days after their birth is also deemed credible. The father's testimony that a specific son of his is the firstborn is deemed credible at any time.", 
                "One cannot bequeath his estate to one who is not his heir by Torah law. Despite this, one can apportion his estate to his heirs unevenly, with the exception of the firstborn's double portion, which may not be reduced. This principle is relevant only with regard to inheritance; if one distributes his property to others during his lifetime, even if he reserves the rights of usage until after his death, he can distribute the property to whomever he wishes. The Sages are displeased with one who distributes his entire property to people other than his heirs.", 
                "Although one's sons take precedence with regard to inheritance, a wife's marriage contract guarantees her and her daughters sustenance from the estate. This right precedes the sons' right to receive their inheritance.",

And I subscribed the deed, and sealed it, and called witnesses, and weighed the money in the balances. So I took the deed of the purchase, that which was sealed, the terms and the conditions, and that which was open. (Jeremiah 32:9–11)",

                "In this chapter, the Gemara discusses the above verses and concludes that no practical halakhic deductions may be drawn from these verses in Jeremiah. Nevertheless, it is possible to learn from them that already in First Temple times there were distinct procedures involved in the formulation of deeds and intricate methods of acquisition associated with them. Since the Torah itself does not mention legal documents, with the exception of the bill of divorce mentioned in Deuteronomy 24:1, all the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> pertaining to such documents are rabbinic ordinances instituted through the ages, from the time of Moses down to the latter generations of talmudic Sages. This chapter, the final chapter of the tractate, discusses several fundamental issues concerning the legal documents relevant to the various kinds of business transactions dealt with throughout the tractate.", 
                "One issue is the correct method of writing the text and signing of witnesses on a document. In mishnaic times there were two types of documents: Ordinary documents and tied, or folded, documents. The proper procedure for preparing each of these documents is examined in this chapter: Where and how the witnesses should sign, under what circumstances a document may be written upon paper or parchment that had its original text written and erased, how to erase or correct errors in documents, and how to resolve apparent contradictions found in a document's text.", 
                "Other issues discussed are: May a document for a legal transaction be written with the consent of only one of the parties involved, or is it necessary to consult with and receive the consent of all the parties? Which party is required to pay the wages of the one who writes the document?", 
                "The Gemara also considers a somewhat related issue: If one has a document that has become erased or is fading and is bound to become illegible, is there a way to have the contents copied into a replacement document? The chapter addresses yet another question: If a promissory note is paid in part, should a new promissory note be written for the balance, or is the original promissory note to be retained, with a receipt issued to the debtor to protect him from subsequent collection of the full amount?", 
                "Toward the end of the chapter, the concept of a loan guarantee is raised. The basic idea of a guarantee is mentioned in the Torah, but its application to a loan guarantee is not clear. One question that arises is: What is the legal relationship between the creditor and the guarantor? Is the guarantor obligated to repay the loan only if the debtor defaults, or can the creditor approach the guarantor directly? Other issues discussed include the following: Is a guarantor legally bound by merely stating he will serve as a guarantor, or must his commitment be recorded in writing? What is the precise formulation that obligates a guarantor to honor his pledge? Can property that a guarantor has sold to others subsequent to undertaking the guarantee be seized as repayment?",

This is true of houses in a courtyard, of courtyards in an alleyway, and of parcels of land in an expanse of fields. In many cases, properties are jointly owned by more than one person. Sometimes it is more convenient for people to live side by side with other people without marking a boundary between them; at other times people prefer to divide up jointly owned property and erect a barrier between them and their neighbors.",

One series of questions relates to the separating wall: Are there fixed <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> concerning the height or thickness of the wall, or the materials of which the wall must be constructed? Where exactly is the wall erected, and who enjoys the rights to the wall, both the right to use it and the right to possess the materials from which it is constructed, should it one day collapse?",

When two neighbors agree to build a wall between their respective properties, each party contributes half of the space upon which the wall is to be constructed and pays half of the construction costs. If the wall later collapses, the space and the materials are divided equally between them. If one of the neighbors builds the wall on his own, he builds it wholly on his property and at his expense, and he fashions a border mark to indicate that he alone built the wall.", 
                "The Gemara also concluded that invasion of privacy resulting from exposure to the gaze of one's neighbor is considered damage, and therefore in a place where there is such an invasion of privacy one party can compel the other to build a barrier, which must be at least four cubits high.", 
                "One party can compel the other to build a partition in three other instances: Where there is an invasion of privacy in one's courtyard or in a garden where it is customary to erect a barrier; when a neighbor who initially opposed building a wall demonstrates that he is pleased that it was built, e.g., by completing a fence erected by his neighbor; or when the initially reluctant neighbor derives benefit from the barrier, such as by building another wall close to it in order to cover both walls with a roof.",

The Gemara determined that responsibility for funding whatever brings benefit to all of the city's residents is imposed upon all of them, including minor orphans, whereas funds for that which is merely for protection are not collected from Torah scholars.",

The principle is that if the buyer specified his purpose beforehand and he receives merchandise that does not suit his purpose, it is considered a mistaken transaction.

When one buys land for a specific purpose, but the size of the land he purchased was not specified, the seller must provide enough land to enable the buyer to fulfill his intentions. How much land is necessary is determined by a general standard, e.g., if a person purchases land for a house, he acquires a plot of land of a size necessary in order to build a standard-sized house. To this end, the chapter listed the standard sizes for a small house, a large house, a banquet hall, a bridal home, and other structures. It also mentioned the dimensions of a catacomb, including its burial niches, chambers, and courtyards. These standard sizes are also relevant in a case in which a person contracts another to construct one of these structures without specifying the required dimensions. In such a case, the structure must be built according to the standard dimensions of such a structure.",

A private path is four cubits wide, an intercity road is eight cubits wide, a public thoroughfare is sixteen cubits wide, and the road to a city of refuge is thirty-two cubits wide. A king's thoroughfare and the path for a funeral have no maximum measure, and can occupy as much space as required.",

                "The third issue concerns instructions issued by a person on his deathbed. The Sages instituted that unlike the gift of a healthy person, the gift of a person on his deathbed does not require a formal act of acquisition, but is acquired by means of the verbal instruction of the person on his deathbed. This applies only if he transfers ownership of all his property. Furthermore, under certain circumstances he can retract the gift or transfer it to a different recipient.",

It is only if he specifies that he is purchasing the ship and everything that is on it that he acquires everything actually found on the ship, even if it is not part of the ship's functional equipment, e.g., slaves and merchandise on the ship.", 
                "With regard to items that are generally used in tandem, sometimes the sale of one includes the sale of the other, while in other situations this is not the case. For example, if one sells a yoke that harnesses two oxen together, he has not sold the oxen themselves, and likewise in the reverse case the yoke is not sold along with the oxen. Similarly, if one buys a wagon he does not acquire the mules that pull it, and if one buys a donkey he does not acquire its equipment. One who buys a cow does not receive its calf, but one who buys a female donkey does acquire its foal along with it. One who buys the head of a large domesticated animal does not acquire its forelegs, whereas one does acquire the forelegs along with the head of a small domesticated animal. The rulings in these cases are affected by the terms and customs of the particular place.",

Therefore, in a case where there is a discrepancy between the known price of the item and the amount paid for it, the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> is as follows: If the difference in price could be attributed to a mistake on the part of the buyer, the standard <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of exploitation apply. If the difference in price is so great that it could not be attributed to an error on his part, it is assumed that the additional sum is a gift to the seller.",

By contrast, if both parties agree on the sale of one type of item and the item is discovered to be of a different kind, the sale is considered to be an error and both parties can renege on the sale.",

The important factors include whether the sale takes place in the domain of the buyer or the seller. If neither of them owns the domain, there is a further distinction between the public domain, an alleyway, and a domain that belongs to another individual. Another important issue is whether a measuring vessel being used to measure the merchandise belongs to the buyer, the seller, or someone else. In practical terms, these variables affect whether each party can renege on the transaction, e.g., if the market price of the merchandise suddenly changes, and who is responsible for the measuring vessel and its contents.",

In this case, the Gemara rules that if one sends a child and gives him money and a vessel to hold the merchandise that he purchases, the storekeeper is responsible for the money and for the merchandise he pours in the vessel. He is not responsible for the vessel itself unless he picks it up for the purpose of using it.", 
                "There are different methods of acquiring movable property. All such items can be acquired by means of lifting, even when the acquisition is performed in the public domain. Heavy and large items, which are not easily lifted, are acquired by means of pulling. Acquisition through pulling is not effective in the public domain. Items that can be pulled only with difficulty, e.g., a ship, are acquired by means of passing, which is performed in the public domain or in a domain that belongs to neither of them. Other options include the acquisition of movable property by means of the land on which it is located or by using a cloth in a symbolic exchange. The acquisition of a promissory note requires both the act of passing and the writing of an additional bill of sale, as they are not acquired by means of passing alone.",

In addition to establishing the extent of the sale, such as whether the ground is also included, and if so, how much ground, it is necessary to define precisely the rights of the new owner to the tree itself and its fruit.",

In certain cases where the sold merchandise differs from the stipulated product, one or both parties may renege on the sale. This leads to another question: At what stage is a transaction considered final? Since one party may change his mind and seek to renege on the transaction or change its terms, it is necessary to ascertain at what point it is final and too late to make changes. Another reason why it is important to determine the end of a sale is that if the merchandise is broken or spilled, whoever is in possession of the goods suffers the loss.",

With regard to the division of the estate of the deceased between the sons and the daughters, the Gemara says that when the estate is large, the sons inherit it, and they are required to provide the daughters with sustenance out of their inheritance. If the estate is insufficiently large to provide for both the sons and the daughters, the daughters' claim takes precedence over the sons' claim, since their right to sustenance is based on the stipulations of the marriage contract. The daughters are therefore provided with sustenance from the estate, while the sons are required to provide for themselves.",

This also applies to profits or losses incurred by one of the brothers due to the honor of the family and social obligations such as the gifts of groomsmen. The adult sons may declare at the outset that they intend to engage in business, enhancing the property for themselves. Furthermore, if the property was enhanced due to the efforts or expenditure of the adult sons, in any event the enhancement belongs entirely to the adult sons. The same applies with regard to a wife who inherited her husband's property.", 
                "The Sages instituted that a person on his deathbed can transfer ownership of his property by verbal instruction, without performing a formal act of acquisition. This was instituted due to the concern that the sick person's condition might be exacerbated by the anxiety and anguish caused by his inability to ensure the implementation of his will. The Gemara's conclusion is that the gift of a person on his deathbed bestowed by verbal instruction is valid whether it was bestowed on a weekday or on Shabbat. With regard to several matters the gifts of a person on his deathbed have the legal status of inheritance, e.g., the transfer of ownership is effected only when the giver dies.", 
                "The Sages distinguish between several forms of gifts of a person on his deathbed. If a person on his deathbed transfers the ownership of all his property, his gift has the legal status of a gift of a person on his deathbed, and if he recovers he can retract the gift. Furthermore, during his illness he can retract the gift or transfer it to another, and the last instruction that he issues takes effect. If a person on his deathbed transfers the ownership of only some of his property, reserving part of his property for himself, his gift does not have the status of the gift of a person on his deathbed, and he cannot retract the gift even if he recovers. If the person on his deathbed clearly indicates that he is bestowing the gift due to his expectation of imminent death, his gift has the status of the gift of a person on his deathbed, even if he transfers ownership of only some of his property.",

If a son and his father died under such circumstances, the father's heirs inherit the property, even if the son owed money to creditors. If the heirs of the two relatives are not the same individuals, e.g., in the case of a mother and son who died, the property is inherited by the heirs whose status is certain. If a husband and wife died under such circumstances, the sum of the marriage contract is inherited by the husband's heirs, the usufruct property is inherited by the wife's heirs, and the guaranteed property is divided between them."

Similarly, when one sells a field, the trees in the field are included in the sale. By contrast, items that are attached to the ground are not included in the sale of the property if they are considered important in their own right, for example, a cistern when a house is sold; or a dovecote, sycamore trees, or carob trees in a field.", 
                "In general, movable property is not included in the sale of land, even if it serves a purpose on the land. Nevertheless, in the case of a field, movable property found in the field is included in the sale, provided that it serves a function in either working or protecting the field.",

If he explicitly states that he is selling the land and everything that is in it, all the movable property that serves any function with regard to the land is included in the sale, but other movable property, such as money or merchandise, is still excluded. In the case of the sale of a field, this specification is even more inclusive, as it includes all of the movable property found in the field, even items such as harvested produce that was left in the field.", 
                "Since the presumption is that a seller sells generously, if certain fixed items that were not included in the sale are situated on the land transferred to the buyer, the seller is obligated to purchase a path in order to access those items. If he states that he is reserving such a path for himself, or if he specifies that he is excluding these items from the sale, he is not required to purchase a path. One who sells a field and retains the trees for himself is not required to purchase a path, as he reserves for himself the land needed to tend the trees even without specifying his intent.", 
                "All of these limitations with regard to what is included in the transaction apply only in the case of a sale, as the seller relies on the fact that the buyer could have stipulated that he wanted specific items to be included in the sale. But in cases where one gives the property as a gift or consecrates it, all movable property found in the land is included, with the exception of those items that are clearly not connected to the land.

It also does not include the pit, cistern, tunnels, or roof, as these are all considered separate entities. Additionally, the seller has not sold that which is found above the roof or below the ground unless he specifies that he is also selling the depths and the heights of the house. With regard to the sale of a city, everything within the city's borders is sold, but the nearby villages and lands are not, unless they serve some function only for that city.",

Mere possession of movable property, the farming of land, or living in a house is not in and of itself an act of acquisition. Therefore, if one was, for example, living in a house, and another claimed that the house in fact belongs to him and is able to prove that he had been the owner in the past, the one living in the house would be required to substantiate his ownership by producing documentation or witnesses who testify that he had acquired it.", 
                "The Sages understood that it is unrealistic to expect those who purchase property to retain their documentation indefinitely. They therefore ruled that if the one in possession is able to prove that for a significant duration he had been in possession of and profited from a property as an owner would, and the prior owner had not lodged a protest concerning his usage, this is sufficient to establish the presumption of ownership, and no further proof is needed. This presumption of ownership is referred to as <span class=\"it-text\">hazaka</span>.",

It is necessary to clarify which imperfections the buyer is prepared to accept because they are part and parcel of the nature of real estate, and which defects he is unwilling to accept because they are more severe. It is natural that not all fields are completely level; rather, they are liable to contain inclines, slopes, rocks, and crevices. Due to this reality, it is necessary to define when such imperfections in a field are considered part of the nature of landed property and when they are considered a loss to the buyer to the extent that he is entitled to a refund of part of the purchase price paid for the field or to compensation in the form of additional land.",

In such a case the precise conditions of the sale must be examined, to clarify whether the seller committed himself to selling a field of a precise size or whether he intended to sell a field of approximately that size. Even when the parties agree in advance that the measurements need not be precise, there is still a standard for deviation from the stipulated measurements, and when that standard is exceeded, the party who stands to suffer a loss must be compensated. With regard to the compensation, the Gemara discusses whether the difference must be returned in money or in land.",

                "Since this tractate deals primarily with monetary law and monetary relationships, the principles governing these issues differ in their very essence from those governing ritual matters, or the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> and judgments of the Torah in general. One of the central components is the enormous authority granted to courts to ordain laws and enactments. By power of the principle that property declared ownerless by a court is ownerless, a court is authorized to declare one's property ownerless or grant it to another person. Therefore, whatever is done by power of the court, and in great measure also that which is done by the community's leaders, has the force of <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>, even when not explicitly stated in the Torah.", 
                "Another difference between Jewish monetary law and Jewish ritual law follows from the fact that one may give away his money or waive rights granted to him by <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>. For this reason, many of the laws and enactments in this tractate are directives for deciding the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> when no agreement has been reached between the parties. But when the parties are prepared to reach an agreement, they can decide monetary matters between them as they see fit.", 
                "Tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Bava Batra</span> addresses four principal issues: Relations between neighbors, the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of presumption of ownership and deeds, the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of sales, and the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of inheritance.", 
                "Most of these <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> are based on <span class=\"it-text\">hazaka</span>, a concept that has multiple meanings, some of which are clarified in this tractate in a comprehensive and profound manner.", 
                "In its most general sense, a <span class=\"it-text\">hazaka </span>is a presumption with regard to the nature of reality, and in the special context of this tractate it is a presumption with regard to the nature and behavior of human beings, i.e., how an ordinary person behaves in a particular situation, and how an ordinary person understands and formulates agreements. With regard to the details, there is, of course, room for disagreement: Does one suffer when another can see into his property, and to what extent does he suffer? Is a foul odor or excessive noise beyond what an ordinary person is prepared to accept? At what point does one protest when an unauthorized person uses his property? How long does the average person hold on to written records?", 
                "Similar questions arise with regard to the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of sales. When one buys or sells property, whether by way of a written or an oral agreement, how are his intentions to be understood? Of course, a precise and detailed contract prevents misunderstandings and disagreements. But in the absence of a clear contract, such matters must at times be decided by a court. This tractate provides the definition of certain items, e.g., house, vineyard, boat, and the like. What does each of these terms include, and what is not included? If one buys an item that turns out to be defective or deficient, can he cancel the transaction or demand compensation? When is it said that a defect is insignificant and no reasonable person would raise objections about it?", 
                "Another fundamental issue in commercial transactions relates to <span class=\"it-text\">gemirut da'at</span>, final intention or making up of the mind of the parties to a transaction. Here too, the matter is decided in accordance with normal human behavior: When is an action performed under compulsion considered void, and when does it have legal force?", 
                "Since the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> in these areas are not established according to objective criteria dictated by Torah law, they enjoy considerable flexibility. Much depends on regional custom and the manner in which the people of a particular place conduct their affairs. The principle that everything is in accordance with the regional custom is important with regard to these <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span>, because general agreement can establish the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> in a particular place, whether it was reached through a formal decision of the local residents or expresses the general consensus without any explicit decision ever having been reached. Similarly, many of the matters discussed in this tractate are decided in practice in accordance with the discretion of the judges, who must take into account the circumstances of the time and place, and the particular parties.", 
                "The <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of inheritance differ slightly from the rest of the topics discussed in the tractate, because they are based on what is written in the Torah, and for this reason they do not depend solely on the intentions of the deceased and the heir. While the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of inheritance are by Torah law and are not subject to change, they can be circumvented in various ways, e.g., through a deed of gift or through a deathbed declaration. The requirement that the marriage contract to a widow or a divorcée be paid, and the complex conditions attached to it with regard to providing for the needs of the widow and those of the sons and daughters of the deceased, create an additional factor that must be addressed. Some of the discussions in the tractate come to resolve the problems, and occasionally the contradictions, stemming from this additional consideration.",

What method should be used? When should the search ideally be conducted, and is it valid if conducted at other times? Who is obligated to perform the search, especially in cases where more than one person is responsible for a property? A full discussion of these issues provides a major focus of this chapter."

                "The major focus of this chapter was a discussion of the rabbinic enactment to conduct a search for leaven before the onset of the Festival. The Gemara concluded that the search should ideally be conducted on the night preceding Passover; however, if the search was not conducted then, one is obligated to perform it on the following morning in order to allow for the removal of all leaven from his or her possession by the appropriate time. Furthermore, the search needs to be conducted only in areas of one's property where there is a possibility that leaven will be present.", 
                "The Gemara explained that by Torah law, it is sufficient to nullify any leaven in one's possession, and one does not have to physically remove it from his or her property. The search, then, is not essentially necessary to prevent one from transgressing the prohibition against possessing leaven. The Gemara therefore explained that the true goal of the search is to ensure that leaven is not physically found on one's property even after it has been nullified. This is required due to the concern that a person might come across some leaven remaining in his or her property on the Festival and absentmindedly decide to take ownership of it or to eat it, transgressing the biblical prohibitions involved.", 
                "Since the search is not required to prevent a biblical transgression but is due to a rabbinic concern, various leniencies exist. One is not required to search in places where it would be dangerous to do so or would involve excessive effort. One does not need to consider farfetched situations such as the possibility that animals may have brought new leaven into an area that was already searched or where leaven is never brought.", 
                "The Gemara also discussed the time by which all leaven must be removed from one's possession – whether by physically destroying it or by nullifying it. Its conclusion was that the biblical prohibition of possessing leaven begins at the end of the sixth hour. However, by rabbinic decree, one is already prohibited from benefiting from leaven from the fifth hour and from eating it from the fourth.", 
                "The discussion surrounding the removal of leaven concerned many cases in which the presence of leaven is doubtful to begin with, thus highlighting similar cases involving doubts and the principles of how to legislate for them. ", 
                "Incidental to the Gemara's discussion of the removal of leaven, the chapter introduced further discussions about the laws of ritual purity and impurity of foods, including the different degrees of ritual impurity; the special rules that apply to sacrificial foods that become ritually impure; and whether liquids can become ritually impure, and if they can, whether they can impart impurity to other foods. Also highlighted was whether these principles are of biblical or rabbinic origin. The ramifications of these discussions affect the question of what to do with sacred leavened foods that have become impure and whether they may be destroyed before the biblical prohibition against possession of leaven begins."

At that point, any activities may be performed that are necessary for it to be brought as an offering. However, activities that are necessary only in order to prepare the lamb for sacrificing, but could have been completed the previous day, do not override Shabbat. This applies even to activities whose performance violates a rabbinic decree. Furthermore, the Gemara concluded that all this holds true even in the event that the preparatory activities were not performed the previous day and even if the result is that the Paschal lamb will not be brought at all.",

                "Given the above principles, the question arose whether one who sacrifices a Paschal lamb that is later found to be invalid is considered to have unwittingly violated Shabbat and is therefore obligated to bring a sin-offering. The Gemara concluded that any labor performed while engaged in trying to perform a mitzva that overrides Shabbat does not render one liable to bring a sin-offering. Although he did not succeed in fulfilling the mitzva of the Paschal lamb, he is not considered to have violated Shabbat because he was involved in an activity that is essentially permitted in order to enable the fulfillment of the mitzva."

The central issue is the precise relationship between the first and second <span class=\"it-text\">Pesah</span>. Does the second <span class=\"it-text\">Pesah</span> exist only as a second opportunity for those who failed to bring the Paschal lamb on the first <span class=\"it-text\">Pesah</span>, or is it viewed as an independent Festival? The distinction lies in the case of one who was not obligated in the first <span class=\"it-text\">Pesah</span>. Can he nevertheless be required to participate in the second?

Is this true only if he succeeds in actually bringing a Paschal lamb then, or even in cases in which he is exempted from the second <span class=\"it-text\">Pesah</span>, such as in a case where he was ritually impure at that point? Another matter that requires clarification is the extent to which the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of the Paschal lamb on the two <span class=\"it-text\">Pesahim</span> are similar.",

In all these circumstances, the <span class=\"it-text\">halahka</span> depends in part on the type of offering involved.

                "According to the normal schedule in the Temple, the afternoon daily offering was the last offering to be brought. The Paschal lamb provides the exception to this rule as it must be brought at the conclusion of the day. To facilitate this, the slaughter of the afternoon daily offering was moved back to an earlier time. If Passover eve occurred on a Friday, the whole schedule was advanced even earlier to allow for everything to be completed before the onset of Shabbat.", 
                "The Gemara discussed three types of disqualifying intentions that can invalidate the Paschal lamb. First, intention at the time of slaughter to consume the lamb either after the time at which it must be eaten, i.e., the night of Passover, or outside the place in which it must be eaten, i.e., Jerusalem, disqualifies the Paschal lamb in the same way such intention disqualifies any offering. Second, the Paschal lamb is disqualified if slaughtered with the intention that it will be used as a different type of offering. Such intention disqualifies only a Paschal lamb and a sin-offering. Third, and unique to the Paschal lamb, it may be slaughtered only with the intention that it will be eaten by those who can legitimately eat it, i.e., those who were registered in a group for that Paschal lamb beforehand and are ritually pure and available to eat it.",

The Gemara explained that this prohibition is violated if any of the group registered for that Paschal lamb have leaven in their possession inside the Temple courtyard while the lamb is being slaughtered. Although it is prohibited to slaughter the Paschal lamb in such a case, if it were slaughtered nonetheless, the offering is not disqualified. Some opinions expand this prohibition to include any offerings sacrificed during Passover.",

This parallels the events immediately preceding the exodus from Egypt. Distinct from this is the festival of <span class=\"it-text\">Matzot</span>, the weeklong Festival beginning on the fifteenth of Nisan and characterized by the prohibitions against consuming or possessing leaven throughout the week, and the obligation to eat <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span> on the first night. This commemorates the actual exodus. There is a confluence of these two Festivals on the evening of the fifteenth, when the Paschal lamb is eaten and the festival of <span class=\"it-text\">Matzot</span> begins.",

The first, tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Pesah Rishon,</span> discusses the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of the festival of <span class=\"it-text\">Matzot</span>,<span class=\"it-text\"> </span>including the prohibition of leaven, its elimination from one's possession, and the mitzva to consume <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span>. The second, tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Pesah Sheni,</span> deals with the festival of <span class=\"it-text\">Pesah</span> and the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of the Paschal lamb. Some suggest that it is for this reason that the tractate as a whole is entitled <span class=\"it-text\">Pesahim</span>, the plural of <span class=\"it-text\">Pesah,</span> since it includes within it these two tractates of <span class=\"it-text\">Pesah</span>.", 
                "The tractate also deals with two <span class=\"it-text\">Pesahim</span> in a different sense. Ideally, the Paschal lamb is to be sacrificed on the fourteenth of Nisan and consumed later that night. However, those who are unable to do so have a second opportunity a month later, on the fourteenth of Iyyar and later that night. The first opportunity is called <span class=\"it-text\">Pesah Rishon</span>, the first Passover, and the second is called <span class=\"it-text\">Pesah Sheni</span>, the second Passover.", 
                "As stated, the festival of <span class=\"it-text\">Matzot</span> is characterized by the prohibition against eating or possessing leaven. Remarkably, the reason for this prohibition is neither explained by the Torah nor discussed in the Gemara. It is instructive, however, that a similar prohibition of leaven also applies to the sacrificial rite; namely, that no leaven may be offered on the altar. Instead, all grain-based offerings are unleavened. This may indicate that the exclusive consumption of unleavened produce achieves elements of purity and sanctity.", 
                "The Torah states the prohibitions concerning leaven only in general terms but never defines precisely what is intended: Which types of food can become leavened, what is the precise definition of being leavened, and does the prohibition apply to items that will not be eaten? Similarly, the prohibition against possessing leaven necessitates that it be removed from one's home. However, the many practical implications of this are not explained by the Torah. When and how should the leaven be removed from one's possession? Obviously, throughout the year leaven is constantly found in the home. Which areas of the home need to be checked? In what manner and to what extent? The prohibition against leaven includes both eating it and deriving benefit from it. What is included in this prohibition? This question itself raises more general issues regarding other prohibited foods and items from which one is not allowed to gain benefit. All these topics are discussed in the first section of the tractate, <span class=\"it-text\">Pesah Rishon</span>.", 
                "The second section of the tractate, <span class=\"it-text\">Pesah Sheni</span>, provides a detailed discussion of all aspects of the rite of the Paschal lamb and the Temple service surrounding it. This section closely resembles tractates within the order of <span class=\"it-text\">Kodashim</span>, which deals with the sacrificial rite. The style of the Gemara's analysis of the sacrificial rite differs significantly from that employed by the Gemara in other areas. Heavy emphasis is placed on hermeneutics, and references to <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> given to Moses at Sinai are more prominent. Principles derived in one area of the Temple service are not always immediately applied to another, as each aspect of the service maintains an independent identity.", 
                "Owing to the great sanctity of the offerings, there is a plethora of rules that apply to every stage of their rites. Significantly, and unlike most other mitzvot, emphasis is placed not only on the correct physical performance of the rite but also on the intentions of those involved. Improper intent can even, at times, entirely disqualify an offering.", 
                "The Paschal lamb is, in one regard, just one of the many different offerings sacrificed in the Temple. As such, all the halakhot that apply to regular offerings apply to a Paschal lamb. For example, the sacrifice of all offerings comprises four sacrificial rites, all indispensable: The animal is slaughtered; its blood is collected in a holy vessel; it is carried to the altar; and then the blood is sprinkled upon the altar. Each of these rites must be performed correctly, and failure to do so can disqualify the offering. In addition, the many types of offerings are grouped into different subcategories, each with its own <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span>. The Paschal lamb is included within various subcategories, which provide a second level of <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> that must be followed. ", 
                "However, there are many <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> that are unique to the Paschal lamb. For most offerings, the consumption of its meat, whether by the priests or by those bringing the offering, is of minor importance. Even if an offering might never be consumed, it may still be permissible to bring it. Not so for the Paschal lamb. The consumption of its meat by those bringing it is one of its central purposes, and a Paschal lamb that will not be eaten may not be brought at all. There are therefore numerous <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> pertaining to its preparation and consumption. This includes the way it is roasted, the need for those who wish to partake of it to be registered into a group beforehand, and the manner in which it is eaten. ", 
                "The Paschal lambs that were sacrificed by the children of Israel in Egypt provide a paradigm for the Paschal lambs that are to be sacrificed each year throughout the generations. Accordingly, many of the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of the Paschal lamb parallel those that were given to the children of Israel in Egypt. In this way the Paschal lamb is able to serve as a remembrance of the exodus from Egypt throughout the generations.",

As such, in many cases, when a Paschal lamb is disqualified from being used for its purpose, it defaults to a peace-offering. For example, a Paschal lamb that was lost and located only after it was supposed to be sacrificed and an animal that has been substituted for such an animal are treated as if they are peace-offerings. Similarly, a Paschal lamb that was lost and then found in time to be sacrificed must be left to graze until it develops a disqualifying blemish, at which point it may be sold and its money used to purchase peace-offerings. Also, a Paschal lamb whose owners died is brought as a peace-offering. ",

                "The Gemara explained that the prohibition against performing labor on the eve of Passover is not absolute but is similar in scope to the restrictions on the intermediate days of a Festival. This prohibition was not observed in a universal manner; in some places people were accustomed to refrain from labor only from midday, while others refrained from labor throughout the day. Either way, a person is bound to the practice of the place he or she lives and may not veer from it. ", 
                "The main discussion of the chapter concerned the case of a person who travels from a place where one custom is observed to a place with a different custom. The Gemara explained that in such a case a person should act in accordance with the stringencies of both customs. This principle applies not just to the specific case of labor on Passover eve, but is true for all customs. Furthermore, this applies even if the customs of the person's hometown are intrinsically linked to the environment of that place and logically should not apply elsewhere. All this is true, however, only where an individual continues to associate himself with his point of origin. Once a person is not just visiting a different place but has decided to relocate, he is bound only by the customs of his new locale.", 
                "The acceptance of a custom is considered akin to taking a vow upon it. Therefore the customs observed by a whole locale have particular force, as a public vow cannot easily be revoked. For this reason, as long as a person identifies himself as a resident of that locale he is fully bound by its customs. However, for the same reason, a person is not technically bound by the customs observed in a place he is only visiting. The reason he is nevertheless required to observe those customs is to avoid the discord that could arise by acting differently to those around him. Because of this concern, in certain cases a person will be unable to observe the stringencies of his hometown's customs because that itself may cause discord, and he would continue to observe his hometown's customs only in private. ",

                "The Gemara also discussed the relative importance of different customs. This can be dependent on place, i.e., customs of Eretz Yisrael, due to the importance of the land, take preference over customs of the diaspora. This may also be dependent on who originally developed the custom, and whether they were Torah scholars or not. Some customs are considered to be unfounded and may therefore, in certain cases, not be binding at all."

This issue forms the central theme of this chapter. The Torah states explicitly only that leaven and leavened bread are prohibited. However, it remains unclear whether other foods that contain leavened ingredients should also be covered by this prohibition. Is one permitted to retain possession of a mixture of leaven and other foods? Does its consumption entail the same punishment of <span class=\"it-text\">karet</span> as one who eats leavened bread? What proportion of the mixture needs to be leaven in order to entail the various prohibitions? Furthermore, what are the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> pertaining to leavened material that is not meant for consumption? Is there nevertheless a prohibition to eat it, or to be in possession of it?",

This immediately gives rise to other questions: When does one need to be concerned that a food might have become leavened, and what is the status of foods that were only partially leavened?", 
                "The discussion surrounding these issues also serves to highlight the relationship between the two prohibitions concerning leaven. Is the prohibition against possessing leaven merely a biblical safeguard to ensure that one does not come to eat it, or is it an independent prohibition that exists parallel to the prohibition against eating it?",

There are cases where the court characterizes the statement of the witnesses as merely revealing a matter, i.e., revealing a fact that by its very nature would have been revealed and publicized. In other cases, the Sages relied on flawed testimony because the problem is rabbinic in nature and they determined that in that case, full-fledged testimony is not required. Furthermore, there are the cases that constitute the bulk of the discussion in this chapter where there is testimony that must either be accepted in its entirety or rejected in its entirety.

Throughout later generations as well, when a wedding could take place any day of the week, including Friday, one must take those two ordinances into account. It is possible to have a wedding on Friday due to the halakhic ruling that it is permitted to engage in intercourse with a virgin on Shabbat.

Likewise, one relies on her credibility to establish the unflawed lineage of an offspring that she conceived while single.

                "One of the primary questions relates to the attitude toward the language of the verses: Do the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of the seducer and the rapist apply only in the cases delineated in the verse; or does the verse merely cite a specific case in order to illustrate the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>, which applies in other cases as well? This question relates to several details. Does this apply only to a young woman who is a virgin or does it apply to a minor girl and a grown woman as well? Does this apply only to a young woman whose father is alive, or even to an orphan? Is the right of refusal for the marriage of the victim exclusively that of the father and is it applicable only in the case of seduction?", 
                "Another related fundamental problem is: What is the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha </span>when there is an additional prohibition associated with this intercourse beyond the seduction and the rape? It could be that the woman is forbidden to the rapist by rabbinic law, due to a positive mitzva, due to a prohibition, or even due to a prohibition punishable by death. Is the perpetrator required to marry his victim in all these cases? Is he obligated to pay the fine? Does he receive only one punishment, or is he is subject to both punishments? These questions require a comprehensive analysis of the general principles of punishment: What is the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha </span>when there is more than one punishment for violating a single prohibition?", 
                "Another basic question involves the nature of the payment paid by the seducer and the rapist. Is the sum mentioned in the Torah the total compensation to the victim or is it merely a special fine paid in addition to other payments of compensation like those paid to any other victim of violence? If there are additional payments, how are they assessed and to whom are they paid? ",

It was determined that the woman whose marriage contract was written on an earlier date takes priority over the women who hold marriage contracts written on later dates. This <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> is similar to cases where an individual owes money to multiple creditors. The time of a document's issue is determined according to the day, month, and year it was written. Documents written on the same day are considered as if they were written at the same time, unless they were issued at a location where it was customary to explicitly state the hour of issue as well. ", 
                "This order of priorities exists only when all the wives are still alive or when they are all deceased. However, if one wife is alive and another is deceased, the one who is alive collects her marriage settlement as a creditor and takes priority over the sons of the wife who is deceased, whose claim to their mother's marriage settlement is through the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of inheritance. ", 
                "There is a range of opinions with regard to a case where the marriage contracts are not of equal value and none of the wives takes priority over the others. Most of the authorities were of the opinion that the holder of the marriage contract of the lowest value ends up receiving the highest percentage of her claim, while the holder of the marriage contract of the highest value collects more than the others only after the others have collected the full amounts of their claims. Conversely, in the case of partners who invested different amounts in a joint business endeavor and decide to dissolve their partnership, they split the assets and profits in proportion to the amounts they invested.

If such a surplus does not exist, the biblical laws of inheritance cannot be left completely unfulfilled. Consequently, the sons divide the entire estate equally among themselves. Furthermore, this stipulation in the marriage contract applies only to property already in the estate and does not apply to potential property expected in the future. ",

                "Torah law does not dictate that a woman must bring a dowry into her marriage from her father's home, and the dowry is not considered an essential component of a marriage. Nevertheless, certain conventions relating to the dowry crystalized over the generations, and the Sages afforded these conventions halakhic<span class=\"it-text\"> </span>weight.",

Is this responsibility purely personal, so that only he is obligated to provide the dowry, or is it a debt that also falls upon his estate? With regard to specific details of the dowry, is the amount of the dowry fixed, so that there is a minimum that the father must provide for this purpose? In addition, the Gemara examines the place of the dowry within the father's total estate, particularly with respect to the hierarchy of collectable debts and obligations.",

These obligations go beyond the basic sums of the marriage contract and whatever supplemental stipulations the husband adds of his own accord. The obligatory supplements vary not only depending upon the amount of property that a woman brings in as a dowry, but also depending on the type of property. For these purposes, there is a critical distinction between liquid assets, which are readily available for business and investments, and illiquid assets, which are not fit for spending. Determining the proper exchange for the gifts of the bride's dowry was complicated by the common practice of exaggerating the value of the dowry for the honor of the bride.",

Three categories of matters are characterized as fundamentally violating the conditions of the marriage: Vows, inappropriate conduct, and blemishes.",

While certain prohibitions created by vows may in fact interfere with ordinary married life, at times this is due to the specific predilections of the other spouse. The details discussed in this chapter, however, are standard matters with universal relevance. Therefore, the Gemara must clarify which types of vows create intrinsic disruptions to married life, which types of conduct are deemed fundamentally inappropriate, and which blemishes are considered serious enough to invalidate a betrothal or require divorce.",

However, he is required to pay her father the fine mentioned in the Torah. However, if she was forbidden to him by a prohibition punishable by death, then even if in this particular case the death penalty is not administered, the perpetrator is exempt from paying the fine.",

One is that a person is not punished with two punishments for one prohibited action; rather he receives the more severe punishment. Another is that in the case of any prohibition whose violation incurs both lashes and monetary payment, one pays and is not flogged. One is obligated to make that payment even if the prohibition was punishable by <span class=\"it-text\">karet</span>.",

Furthermore, even if the victim was a young woman who was betrothed and widowed from betrothal, he is obligated to pay. In addition, although the verse refers to a young woman with a father, even if the victim was an orphan the rapist pays a fine. However, with regard to this detail, there is a difference between the victim of rape and the victim of seduction, as one who seduces an orphaned young woman is exempt, because she was complicit in performing the action. With regard to refusal to marry the perpetrator, the Sages derived that this applies to both the victim of rape and the victim of seduction, and both the father and the daughter have the right of refusal.",

However, in addition, like any person who injures another, he pays for pain, humiliation, loss of livelihood, medical costs, and degradation. The fine is payment for the act of intercourse alone.

The same principle likewise applies to a betrothed woman who inherited property before she was betrothed. In contrast, a betrothed woman who inherited property after betrothal may not sell it <span class=\"it-text\">ab initio</span>, but if she already did so, the transaction is binding. A married woman may not sell or do business with usufruct property, and if she transferred the property to someone else, the husband may repossess it from the purchasers. This applies specifically to property that is known to the husband, but if she inherits property in a distant location that is unknown to him, she may sell it and do business with it.",

Concerning property where the principal does not reproduce, all benefit from it is included in the category of produce, and the husband may use it even if this produce is eventually consumed entirely. Property that does not yield any produce is sold and the proceeds are used to purchase property that does yield produce, unless there is some special reason for the woman not to sell it, e.g., if it is an asset of her paternal family.",

The opposite principle applies to produce that is detached from the ground: At the time of marriage it belongs to the wife, while if it is detached at the time of divorce, it belongs to the husband. The expenditures that the husband spends on his wife's property are not assessed to see if they correspond with the profits. Rather, whatever he spent is spent, and he need not return the value of whatever he benefited from. This is the case unless he outlays expenditures but does not benefit at all, in which case he takes an oath as to the amount of his expenses and claims that amount for himself.",

This system of arrangements is set out in a marriage contract [<span class=\"it-text\">ketuba</span>] formulated between the husband and wife or their representatives. This <span class=\"it-text\">ketuba </span>is fundamentally a written [<span class=\"it-text\">katuv</span>] contract, and is characterized in that manner because it is, for all intents and purposes, the only written document that every person requires.

The Sages established that marital ties not regulated by a marriage contract do not constitute marriage at all.

Certain restrictions exist, as the marriage agreement, like any other agreement, cannot include stipulations that are against <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>, because of the principle: Anyone who stipulates a condition counter to what is written in the Torah, his condition is void. This includes stipulations that call for violation of a prohibition as well as those that abrogate obligations incumbent upon the parties by Torah law.

Also by Torah law, the husband is entitled to nullify certain vows taken by his wife. After her death he inherits her property, although not everyone agrees that this is by Torah law. By rabbinic law, the husband is obligated to pay his wife's medical bills and to redeem her from captivity. ",

Income that the wife earns from work, as well as any profits accrued from property belonging to her, and any lost item that she finds, belong to the husband. The Sages also instituted ordinances relating to the rights of the woman after the ties between them are severed by means of divorce or death.",

For this payment, there is a distinction between a virgin, whose marriage contract is two hundred dinars, and one who is not a virgin, whose marriage contract is one hundred dinars. The husband is permitted to add to that sum any amount of money that he chooses, but he may not reduce the fixed sum. If he does, that is tantamount to nullification of the marriage contract, and the couple's relations are considered licentious and not marital relations. ",

After the death of the husband, the widow may continue to live in his house and be supported from his property for the duration of her widowhood. Likewise, there is a fixed condition that by the authority of the marriage contract, daughters born to the husband from this wife are supported from his property after his death, and sons born to this woman inherit the sum of her marriage contract in addition to their share in the inheritance.", 
                "This system of marital obligations and rights is typically in effect in every marriage, as even if a particular stipulation is omitted from the document, it is in effect as a stipulation of the court. However, the precise application of these provisions in different cases requires analysis. Similarly, the question arises: Which are the provisions that cannot be amended or abrogated, either due to their essence or because the Sages decreed that they cannot be changed or eliminated? And with regard to the provisions that can be amended, what is the legal way to effect this?",

Quarrels or incompatibility require intervention of the courts or halakhic authorities only if the couple decides to separate. However, there are additional conflicts that require halakhic resolution. One example is when husband and wife each accuse the other that he or she violated the provisions of the agreement. These claims can be with regard to the marriage itself, e.g., when one of the parties claims that he was misled to the extent that he would not have agreed to marry had he been privy to that information. Cases where this problem arises after betrothal and prior to marriage are discussed in tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Kiddushin</span>; cases where this problem arises after marriage belong in tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Ketubot</span>. There are additional claims with regard to fulfillment of the provisions of the agreement between the parties, where each accuses the other of failure to fulfill the obligations. ", 
                "When these disputes come before the court, there are two stages to the halakhic deliberation. First, the court seeks to ascertain whether or not the claims are true. In this case, more than in any other agreement, there are various details that are difficult or impossible to ascertain. For example, if the husband claims that he discovered on the wedding night that his wife was not a virgin, there is rarely external testimony supporting either the husband's claim or the bride's counterclaim. In order to resolve the dispute, the court must rely on general determinations with regard to the credibility of the people and their claims. ", 
                "The second stage involves ameliorating the situation. Based on the severity of the claims of the husband or wife, there are different manners of resolution, e.g., annulment of the marriage; mandating that the husband divorce his wife, paying her marriage contract if he was the guilty party and not paying it if she was the guilty party; or imposing fines and penalties to compel fulfillment of the terms of the <span class=\"it-text\">ketuba</span>.",

In addition, several related matters are discussed, e.g., the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot </span>of lineage, victims of rape and seduction, and the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot </span>of the slanderer.

The second explores the details of the standard provisions of the marriage contract.

And if he espouse her to his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters. If he takes another wife for himself, her food, her clothing, and her conjugal rights he shall not diminish.

And the young woman's father shall say to the Elders: I gave my daughter to this man as a wife, and he hates her; and he has placed wanton charges, saying: I did not find in your daughter the tokens of virginity; and these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity. And they shall spread the garment before the Elders of the city. And the Elders of that city shall take the man and chastise him.

The main sources in the Torah for these rights are the verses that deal with the sale of one's daughter as a maidservant, and there are also several rabbinic ordinances in this regard. The Gemara debates whether these are personal rights, or monetary rights that can be bequeathed to the father's heirs. ",

                "This chapter recorded several discussions concerning <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> related to spouses' obligations toward one another. With regard to a husband who traveled overseas, the court apportions sustenance for his wife in all cases, and she is required to take an oath only when she comes to claim her marriage contract. This means that the court is obligated to sustain the wife from the husband's estate. However, if a third party willingly paid for her sustenance, he cannot force the husband to reimburse him unless he expressly stipulated at the time that that the money was given as a loan. ", 
                "Concerning a couple's place of residence, one partner cannot compel the other to move to a different land. Furthermore, even within the same country, one cannot force one's spouse to move from one settlement to another, regardless of whether it is smaller, larger, inferior, or superior. However, there is one exception to this principle, and that is Eretz Yisrael. Either spouse may coerce the other to immigrate to Eretz Yisrael, even if this entails a lower standard of living. The same applies to a move to Jerusalem from elsewhere in Eretz Yisrael.", 
                "Returning to the topic of a marriage contract, one of the leniencies of these <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot </span>is that the husband may choose whether he will pay its sum in the currency of the place the contract was written or that of the location where it is actually paid, whichever is more convenient for him. ", 
                "Another case discussed in this chapter is that of a man who died and left behind a small estate. The <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> is that the daughters receive their sustenance from his property, in accordance with the conditions of the marriage contract, while the sons are left to fend for themselves. With regard to a groom who did not receive the promised dowry from his father-in-law, provided that the wife is not responsible for the mishap, she can demand that he either marry her or release her with a bill of divorce.

                "As for the disputes concerning incomplete admission, in a case where it can be understood that the accused is admitting to part of the claim, he is considered to have made a partial admission and must take an oath. One who lost his path but does not know in whose field it ran is entitled to a new path only if he can issue a definitive claim to a particular person. If he is unable to do so, all the owners of the fields around him will defer his claim to the others until he can reach some sort of compromise with them. One who claims ownership over a field which is described as belonging to someone else in a document that he himself signed as a witness, forfeits his claim to the field. However, if he lent money to another and subsequently borrowed from that same individual or sold a field to him, these acts do not constitute an admission that he never lent the money in the first place.

                "As discussed in the introduction to this chapter, there are three primary categories of situations that can result in a court-mandated conclusion to a marriage: Vows, inappropriate conduct, and blemishes.", 
                "With regard to vows, the conclusion is that the Sages intervened to establish <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> only about vows that impinge directly on the married life of the couple. If the couple got married with an explicit stipulation that there would be no vows incumbent upon them, and it was later discovered that there were in fact vows at the time of the betrothal, this can invalidate the marriage retroactively and render the marriage contract irrelevant.", 
                "Vows taken during the time of the marriage present additional complications. After a fundamental discussion with regard to how it is possible to take a vow that contradicts prior obligations, the conclusion is that any vow that withholds from the wife benefits to which she is entitled, whether directly or indirectly, grants her the right to a divorce and to full payment of her marriage contract. This is true regardless of whether the vow concerns a fundamental part of the marriage, such as conjugal rights or the right to sustenance, or whether the vow relates to the ordinary life of a married couple. Although the wife is entitled to a divorce and payment of her marriage contract in all of these cases, there are distinctions between them with regard to the amount of time allotted to the husband to alleviate the problem before being compelled to divorce her. In situations where the distress or difficulty to the wife is greater, the court will compel a divorce with greater urgency.", 
                "Inappropriate conduct by the wife constitutes a direct violation of the implicit terms of the marital agreement. Therefore, immodest behavior or violations of <span class=\"it-text\">halakha </span>that relate to interactions between the husband and wife constitute grounds to divorce the wife without payment of her marriage contract. This is equally true of situations where the husband compels the wife to act in a manner that contradicts norms of appropriate behavior; in such cases the husband will be compelled to divorce his wife with full payment of her marriage contract. ", 
                "With regard to physical blemishes, the conclusion is that certain types of esthetic flaws constitute grounds for invalidating the marriage or forcing a divorce. However, in this regard there is a distinction between the husband and the wife. Whereas relatively minor defects are considered blemishes when it comes to the wife, only the existence of major blemishes in the husband, as defined in the Mishna and Gemara, are grounds to compel him to divorce her and pay for her marriage contract if she so desires.", 
                "There is also a distinction between visible blemishes and hidden ones. With regard to visible blemishes, the husband is generally assumed to have seen them and agreed to accept them, so that he cannot subsequently claim to have been deceived. However, hidden blemishes that he discovers only after getting married can be grounds for invalidating the betrothal retroactively. The detailed analysis of this topic led to a more general discussion about the burden of proof in civil cases where opposing claims are advanced by the two parties with regard to the timing of an event that could potentially invalidate a transaction retroactively. The accepted halakhic conclusion is that the burden of proof falls on the individual in whose domain the uncertainty developed."

                "One of the main topics analyzed in this chapter is the principle: The mouth that prohibited is the mouth that permitted. In other words, in any case where one relies on testimony or the admission of one of the parties, if it is deemed credible it should be accepted in its entirety. Therefore, when one testifies, establishing a fact, whether it relates to him or it relates to another, and he adds certain details that limit or negate the halakhic significance of that testimony, the entire statement of the witness is accepted. This principle applies to ritual matters, e.g., the testimony of a woman regarding with whom she engaged in intercourse, or if she said: I was taken captive but was not violated, or if she said: I was married but now I am divorced; and to monetary matters, e.g., this field belonged to your father and I purchased it from him, or if one said: That is my signature but we were compelled to sign.", 
                "There are two restrictions to this form of credibility. First, it is accorded only when there is no independent source of information with regard to that matter. When there is such information, i.e., witnesses or some other source of objective information that is incriminating, the fact that the party admitted it but then negated its significance does not grant him credibility. Second, when a party's claim involves self-incrimination or is suspect of being false for some external reason, it is not granted credibility. ", 
                "A similar <span class=\"it-text\">halakha </span>exists in cases where one relates a matter that could subject him to a prohibition and he then denies his original statement. In that case, his denial is accepted only if he can provide a rationale explaining why he made his original statement.", 
                "Two other significant matters addressed in this chapter were the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot </span>of ratification of documents and the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot </span>of a captive woman. With regard to ratification of documents the Gemara concluded that when one seeks to undermine the validity of a document by claiming, for example, that it is a forgery, the document is brought before the court and the court determines, by means of testimony or by comparing the signatures of the witnesses with their signatures on documents previously ratified by the court, whether the witnesses' signatures are legitimate. Since the assumption is that witnesses who sign a document ascertained its validity, their testimony is sufficient to ratify it. It was also concluded that the testimony in the ratification of documents relates to the signatures and not to the content of the document, which led to various conclusions in cases where separate testimony is required for each of the signatures.", 
                "With regard to a captive woman, or a woman who was subject to the control of gentiles, e.g., she was in a city under their occupation or she was incarcerated by them, the Sages were concerned that she was raped and therefore forbidden to a priest. However, since it is merely a suspicion, the Sages ruled leniently and relied on testimony that she was not violated from those whose testimony is generally invalid, e.g., one witness, a woman, or a minor. Only the testimony of the woman herself, when there is independent knowledge that she was in captivity, and the testimony of her husband, are invalid.", 
                "On a similar note, the Sages relied on flawed testimony from one witness, from a relative, or from a witness who witnessed the incident as a minor in various cases involving rabbinic law, e.g., elevation to priesthood for matters of rabbinic law and for matters of lineage, and for determining the Shabbat boundaries, especially in those matters that entail merely revealing a fact that by its very nature would have been revealed and publicized."

                "The sum of the marriage contract of a virgin is two hundred dinars, and of a non-virgin, one hundred dinars. A fundamental question relates to the definition of a virgin for these purposes: Is this a medical-biological definition or is it merely a legal definition? Is a virgin a woman whose hymen is intact, a woman who never engaged in intercourse, or a woman who never married? On a related note, who are the women with the presumptive status of a virgin, and who are the women who have lost that presumptive status?",

His claim can be grounds for annulment, for reduction of the sum of the marriage contract, or for concern that the bride is forbidden to her husband as an adulteress. However, before these questions are analyzed, there is another fundamental problem: Was she or was she not a virgin when she married, and if she was not a virgin, how did she lose her virginity? Typically, there is no clear evidence or testimony in that case. There are instances where the woman admits that she was not a virgin, and there are instances where she explains the phenomenon in different ways. Therefore, it must be determined to what degree are the claims of the woman deemed credible. In what cases is the claim of the husband deemed credible, and in what cases is the claim of the wife deemed credible?", 
                "Stemming from these dilemmas, whose answers are largely dependent upon the credibility accorded to the husband's claim, another series of dilemmas is raised, not directly related to the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot </span>of the marriage contract but related to matters of lineage. In the case of an unmarried woman who was suspected or proven to have engaged in intercourse with an unidentified man, to what degree is she deemed credible to claim that the man was of unflawed lineage and therefore she is not disqualified from marrying a priest? Likewise, if she was impregnated by an unidentified man, is she deemed credible if she says that the father of the fetus is of unflawed lineage?",

In addition to the question of the husband's financial responsibility, there is a non-monetary aspect to this question as well: An Israelite woman married to a priest is entitled to eat <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span>, and therefore there is a need to clarify when this right begins.",

Generally speaking, a woman can collect payment for her marriage contract without taking an oath if it is in her possession.

For example, he can release only her from her obligation to take an oath or he can also release inheritors.

Until she is a grown woman, a father receives the money of his daughter's betrothal, fines that are paid to her, and any other payment to which she is entitled. Furthermore, her earnings and any articles she finds go to him. However, he may not make use of her personal property, e.g., those items she inherited or received from others. In addition, a father has the right to betroth his minor daughter to the man of his choice, to accept her bill of divorce on her behalf, and to nullify her vows. Most of these rights are personal, and therefore the father cannot bequeath them to his sons. Consequently, his heirs can claim only those payments that were already owed before the father passed away.",

In short, the case of the defamer is as follows: A man married a young woman, i.e., neither a minor nor a grown woman, who is not a convert, and he engaged in regular sexual intercourse with her. Subsequently, he claimed in court that she was not a virgin, and he brings witnesses that she committed adultery when she was betrothed to him. If the testimony of these witnesses is accepted, she is stoned at the door of her father's house. Even if she does not have a father, or if her father does not have a house, she is executed regardless. If the father brings witnesses who testify that the first pair were false, conspiring witnesses, the guilty witnesses themselves are stoned, in accordance with the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> of false, conspiring witnesses, while the husband is flogged and must pay the father of the young woman one hundred shekels of silver.

Unlike a father, a husband is also entitled to the revenue generated by his wife's property, although the wife retains ownership of the property itself. Several obligations are imposed on a husband, corresponding to these rights. By Torah law, he must provide his wife with food, clothing, and fulfill his conjugal duties. In addition, he is obligated by rabbinic law to pay her medical expenses, to redeem her from captivity, and to pay for her burial. There are also several stipulations of the marriage contract that apply after his death. His widow may continue living in his house while receiving her sustenance from his estate, her daughters are also sustained from his property until their marriage or maturity, and her sons inherit their mother's marriage contract in addition to their share of his inheritance.

While they are very little, up to the age of six, a father is obligated to provide them with sustenance. Beyond this age, the court will pressure him to feed them until their maturity. If he is wealthy and can afford to do so, he will even be compelled to pay for the sustenance of his children."

With respect to concealed injury, one-third is awarded to her husband and the balance becomes the woman's usufruct property.",

When her father is alive, he may provide a dowry of whatever size he sees fit. However, after his death, the daughter has a legal right to receive this one-tenth share of the estate, and she may demand it of the other inheritors. The daughter receives her one-tenth of the estate only from real estate. Although the <span class=\"it-text\">ge'onim </span>later ruled that movable property may also be collected for the settlement of marriage contracts, this allowance was never extended with respect to her right to collect for her dowry.",

By contrast, for utensils and movable property, he obligates himself to pay only the amount of their worth, presuming that these items have been appraised for their actual values. However, if their worth has been exaggerated in honor of the woman, the husband is responsible to pay only the true value of the items.",

",

However, several questions arise when the sum required to pay out all the claims is higher than the value of the estate: First, which of the wives takes priority in collecting payment of her marriage contract, and how is this priority determined in practice? Additionally, how is the property to be distributed when the value of each of the marriage contracts is different, meaning that one woman's claim is for a higher sum than that of the other wives? In such a case, as in a case where a partnership is dissolved and each partner has a different share in the business, there are several possibilities: Either each claimant receives an equal share, or the assets are divided in proportion to the amounts of the different claims, or preference is given to one of the claimants. ", 
                "A third issue concerns the stipulation in the marriage contract which states that each male offspring inherits his mother's marriage settlement, in addition to his fair share of his father's estate. Because the amounts specified in the different marriage contracts are not always identical, and because one of the wives may have fewer sons than the others, it is essential to clarify how the claims of the sons of the different wives are to be settled.", 
                "All of these issues become even more complex in a case where one of the wives waives her rights toward just one of the parties. This can bring about a set of lawsuits where different claimants have relative rights of priority, and a practical solution is necessary. ",

If the widow did not demand sustenance for an extended period of two or three years, she forfeits her right to receive sustenance for that period of time.

However, women whose marriage, though effective, is prohibited by Torah law, are entitled to payment of their marriage contracts. Women who are divorced because of their transgressions are not entitled to the principal or additional sums of the marriage contract."

It is necessary to examine the rights of the finder with regard to that item during the period that it is in his possession.

When the owner of the lost item despairs of its recovery, it is tantamount to renouncing ownership of it, thereby rendering it available to all takers.

Legally, there is an assumption that this acquisition is a condition, implicit or explicit, of the deposit agreement. Therefore, transfer of those ownership rights is not contingent on the actual payment of compensation. The mere agreement of the bailee to waive his right to take an oath and thereby exempt himself from payment for the lost or stolen deposit effects transfer of those rights. The ownership rights of the bailee are limited to those conditions stipulated by the depositor from the outset. If the bailee conveys the deposit to another, even if this entails no misappropriation, he acquires no ownership rights, unless the conveyance was with the approval of the owner.", 
                "Ownership rights to a deposited item are not transferred to the bailee in their entirety. Rather, the transfer stems from and is contingent upon fulfillment of the conditions of the guardianship that he accepted upon himself. Therefore, even when the bailee compensates the owner, he is obligated to take an oath that the deposit is not in his possession, as he has no right to take the item and pay for it without the approval of the owner. The bailee takes an oath that he provided a reasonable level of safeguarding for the deposit, commensurate with the manner in which one safeguards his own belongings. A higher level of safeguarding is required for deposits of money.", 
                "The bailee calculates a certain sum of reasonable depreciation, in accordance with the measures delineated in the mishna. If he discovers that the depreciation of the deposit is greater than expected, the bailee must inform the owner. If that is impossible, he must sell the item to prevent its total loss and return the money to the owner. Doing so constitutes safeguarding a deposit and returning of a lost item.", 
                "Misappropriation is not simple theft, but rather an abrogation of the depositor-bailee relationship. Consequently, one who misappropriates a deposit is liable to pay for the item from the moment that he performs an action involving unauthorized use of the deposit, even if that action did nothing to damage the item. Nevertheless, the bailee is liable only if he takes action. He is not liable for intent, even if he stated that intent. Since the legal status of misappropriation is that of theft, the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> is that from the moment of misappropriation the item is considered stolen by the bailee.

The topics discussed in this tractate include the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot </span>of lost and found items, the loading and unloading of animals, verbal mistreatment, exploitation, charging interest, feeding workers, depositing and borrowing items, withholding wages, and the prohibition against damaging collateral.", 
                "<span class=\"it-text\">Bava Metzia</span> expresses one of the unique aspects of Torah law, namely, that it does not distinguish between civil law and ritual law. Jewish civil law is based not on a social contract but on requirements defined by Torah law and rabbinic law. Accordingly, interpersonal relationships and civil laws are viewed as part of the relationship between the Jewish people and God. Although there are certain distinctions made by the Torah between civil and ritual law, in general they are interwoven in the Torah text, as can be seen, for example, in Exodus, chapters 21–23;<span class=\"it-text\"> </span>Leviticus, chapter 19; and Deuteronomy, chapters 21–25.", 
                "A basic element in Jewish civil law is the integration of compassion with justice. To a large extent, the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> goes beyond the requirements of justice. The obligation to relate to others with compassion and generosity is not merely a supererogatory addition to one's legal obligations; it is normative <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> that is derived from the conception of the Jewish people as one family. This is the reason for the distinction that one finds between general <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> that structure economic life, which apply to all, and specific <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> that apply only to interactions with fellow Jews. The general <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot </span>are as much a part of the Noahide mitzva to construct a fair legal system, which is incumbent upon all humanity, as they are aspects of Jewish law. By contrast, <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot </span>addressing interpersonal relationships, such as the obligation to return lost property and the prohibition against charging or paying interest, are not features of a legal system whose only purpose is justice. Rather, they reflect the requirement to have compassion on and care for one's fellow Jew.",

The second category includes <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot </span>that apply only to transactions between Jews, the rationale for which has been explained above. The third category describes acts that are not punishable by the courts but are discouraged by the Sages. An example of the court's response to one such act would be the curse administered by the court to one who does not keep his word. Finally, the fourth category states <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of ethical behavior. These behaviors were practiced by people of high integrity, and they are based on the verse: “That you may walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous” (Proverbs 2:20).",

Although an item is usually owned by the person in whose possession it is held, sometimes that is not the case, e.g., when an item is loaned or rented to another, or when it is deposited with another for safekeeping or as collateral for a loan. At other times, the item is not in the possession of its owner because it has been stolen or lost. In each of these cases, the tractate discusses who has halakhic ownership of the item, and who is responsible for safeguarding it and liable for damage caused to the item or by the item.",

Even in cases where it is clear that someone performed a valid act of acquisition, it is necessary to determine the exact point in time when the ownership was transferred in order to resolve issues of multiple claims of ownership of the item.

Nevertheless, it is accepted that the verses: “When you come into your neighbor's vineyard, then you may eat grapes until you have enough at your own pleasure; but you shall not put any in your vessel. When you come into your neighbor's standing grain, then you may pluck ears with your hand; but you shall not move a sickle onto your neighbor's standing grain” (Deuteronomy 23:25–26), are discussing a laborer working for the owner of a vineyard.",

The specific examples mentioned in the verses serve to teach that a laborer is entitled to eat solely from that which grows from the ground, and only when he is occupied with harvesting the crop, which is considered the completion of the work of the produce, or near the completion of its work in the case of detached produce. Laborers who are busy with other agricultural work, even if it involves produce, including produce whose work has been completed, do not have the right to eat from it by Torah law. Nevertheless, the standard custom is that various kinds of watchmen may also eat from the produce under their care.",

                "As stated earlier, by Torah law a laborer may eat from the produce only while he is actually performing labor. The Sages instituted an ordinance that a laborer may also eat while he moves from one place to another within the field, in order to save time. Since by Torah law there is no connection between the work the laborer performs and the produce that he eats, in theory he may eat more than the worth of his wages, and he may even consume produce worth more than the benefit he provides to the employer through his labor. Nevertheless, the Sages advise laborers not to be greedy, as this will deter potential employers from hiring them in the future.", 
                "The prohibition stated in the verse: “You shall not muzzle an ox in its threshing” (Deuteronomy 25:4), was also discussed in detail. One may not prevent any animal from eating while it is engaged in performing labor with crops. It is permitted for the owner of the produce to give the animal other food as substitute for the produce with which it is working, but he may not take any measures which cause it not to eat, even if these fall short of actual muzzling.",

A paid bailee, whether he receives money or any other form of benefit, is liable for theft or loss but is exempt from liability for a loss due to circumstances beyond one's control.

The same <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> that apply to a paid bailee also apply to one who rents an item; the only difference is that one who rents an item or animal is not liable if it was damaged or injured while it was used for labor.

The Gemara discussed at length the precise limitations of this exception and concludes as follows: Although the Torah states the exemption only with regard to a borrower, the exemption actually applies to all four categories of bailees. In order for a bailee to be exempt, the owner of the item must be working for the bailee at the time that the latter received the item, irrespective of whether the owner was already working for the borrower before that time or if the owner's services were contracted and his item was borrowed simultaneously.

In some cases one or both parties claim with certitude that the arrangement was of a certain nature and in other cases they will admit that they are unsure. The Gemara discusses these cases and concludes that a claim made with certitude is more powerful than one in which the other party admits he is unsure, and it is certainly more powerful than one where the other party claims he simply does not remember what happened. In general, there are two guiding principles. The first is that the burden of proof rests upon the claimant. The second is that in cases in which proof cannot be provided, if the claims between the parties are of a type that generate an obligation for the defendant to take an oath, and because he admits that he does not know for certain what happened he is unable to take that oath, he is liable to pay.", 
                "The chapter also discusses the rental of houses and various complications that could arise. The Gemara explains that when a property is rented out and the parties never agreed between them when the rental period should end, the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> is that in general, each side may unilaterally end the rental. The Gemara notes various limitations to this, primarily that a landlord may not evict his renter during the rainy season unless he had given prior notice during the summer. The length of the notice he must provide depends on the purpose of the property being rented, with a minimum of thirty days for a house rented for residence and three years for certain types of businesses.", 
                "A landlord must ensure that his house can provide all the basic needs of his renter, including those features that require that a craftsman install them. Features that are not part of the house's structure and that do not require that a craftsman install them are the responsibility of the renter.", 
                "A rental agreement for an unspecified house obligates the landlord to provide a house for the entire rental period even in the event that the house he initially provided collapses. A replacement house can be different than the original house, unless it was implicit in the initial agreement that a house of a certain size or structure was being rented."

The chapter addresses the process of clarifying these conflicting claims and the apportioning of rights and ownership.", 
                "In analyzing this topic, the chapter addresses many specific questions, both conceptual and practical: Does the fact that two people lay claim to the same item mean that one is deliberately lying? If so, how does the court act against the deceitful party? When is it appropriate for the court to use methods of clarification and coercion, such as requiring a litigant to take an oath, in the context of litigants who are suspect? How is the court to act if it is believed that both litigants may be somewhat justified in their claims and neither is actually lying? How does a court allocate rights to a contested property when it is not possible for the court to fully clarify the facts of the case?",

What is the status of one who is not a litigant but is impacted by the case? As an example, the conflict between a debtor and creditor will affect a broader circle of people, such as one who purchased a field from the debtor and may now be subject to a lien on his land."

Therefore, the chapter dealt at length with questions of how the court should rule when it is not clear which litigant has presumptive ownership of the property and which is considered the claimant.",

The intent to acquire it must be expressed through a valid act of acquisition.

Furthermore, even when it is clear that the claim of one of the litigants must be false, the court assumes that he is not necessarily lying outright. Rather, the assumption is that he is trying to avoid payment temporarily, and he does not lose his basic credibility as a result. Therefore, one who is suspect with regard to financial dishonesty is not consequently suspect with regard to oaths. This is the basis for the ability of an oath to provide final clarification of the validity of a litigant's claims.",

On the one hand, work agreements do not completely shackle laborers, as the Torah states that God proclaims: “For to Me the children of Israel are servants” (Leviticus 25:55). The Sages infer from this verse that Jews can be servants only to God, but not to other servants of God. Consequently, labor relations depend on human freedom, which means that employers do not have the authority to force laborers to work.", 
                "On the other hand, this freedom for laborers does not grant them the right to cause their employers financial loss. Laborers must compensate employers for monetary loss due to their refusal to work commensurate with the loss caused. In this way, there is a balance between the two sides, so that market forces, the employer's needs, the type of labor, and the skill level of the laborers are all factors guiding their negotiations, both prior to the beginning of the work and whenever disputes arise during the course of the assignment. Furthermore, in each specific case, the reason the party in question reneged is also taken into consideration, as people generally do not enter into agreements with the intent to take responsibility for incidents that occur due to circumstances beyond their control.",

Yet here too there are limits. For example, the renter is not entitled to compensation for damage caused to the animal in the course of sensible fulfillment of the agreement if the reason for the damage is not the owner's fault. Additionally, there is a principle that whoever changes the terms accepted by both parties is at a disadvantage. Although there are disputes with regard to precisely what defines a change from the terms of an agreement, nevertheless, it can be broadly stated that if damage occurs and one party has diverged from the agreement, that party is liable for compensatory damages.", 
                "Concerning artisans' and skilled laborers' responsibility for the item in their possession, the consensus is that they are considered paid bailees: Although they are not actually paid for safeguarding the item, they are liable for theft and loss, as they do derive financial benefit from the fact that the item is in their custody. With regard to hired porters, not only are they liable to pay for damage that occurred to items while they transported them, but they also bear a presumption of negligence from which they can free themselves only by taking an oath to the contrary.",

One of the fundamental issues here is identifying the nature of this collateral: Is it taken to ensure that the debtor pays back his debt, or does the collateral itself constitute the collection of the debt?

The most basic definition is that any additional payment in return for delaying the repayment of the loan is prohibited as a form of interest, no matter how this interest is paid, whether with money, in the form of other benefits that have monetary value, or even in the form of various types of benefits that have no monetary value, such as greeting someone or engaging in other forms of verbal interest.",

With regard to joint business ventures, the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> is that the investor must accept upon himself a higher percentage of risk than the profit he receives, either by increasing his responsibility for possible losses or by decreasing the share of profit he receives from the venture. The principle is that a transaction is permitted if, from the lender's perspective, it is close to loss and far from profit.",

Even if it is uncertain whether interest will be paid by the borrower to the lender, nevertheless, if the lender benefits from the borrower's property as a result of the loan, this is prohibited as interest.", 
                "Another fundamental discussion concerned whether a court can compel a lender to return interest that he collected from a borrower. The fundamental question is whether the prohibition of interest should be viewed as a sin between man and God, and therefore the punishment will be delivered at the hand of Heaven, or whether interest is viewed as money gained illegitimately, even if the borrower agreed, and therefore can be removed by means of legal proceedings adjudicated by judges. The conclusion is that fixed interest, which is forbidden by Torah law, can be removed by means of legal proceedings adjudicated by judges, but interest forbidden by rabbinic law cannot be removed.",

In addition, although the formulation of contracts is determined by the custom of the people in that location and the local vernacular, the Sages nevertheless attach special significance to the wording of these agreements and derive certain halakhic details from them. This is true not only of contracts concerning an agreement between a landowner and a cultivator but also for other cases where it is accepted to use a fixed text for the contract.",

This obligation is rooted in the concept that the court coerces individuals that exhibit conduct characteristic of Sodom; i.e., one may not prevent another from benefiting if no loss is suffered on his part. Therefore, the limitations to the law of one whose field borders the field of his neighbor are simple: In any case where the seller would suffer a loss of either money or time if he were to sell the property to his neighbor, he is not obligated to do so.",

If the employee demands his wages, the employer violates at least one prohibition and sometimes more if he delays the payment of wages for more than twelve hours, and in some exceptional cases if he delays for more than twenty-four hours.

Second, it is prohibited to appropriate utensils that are used for the preparation of food. One who violates the latter of these prohibitions is liable for each utensil taken, and if the utensil consists of a pair of items, one is liable for both parts.

One conclusion is that, by Torah law, monetary transactions are proper transactions. By rabbinic law, a commodity can be acquired only by pulling it or lifting it, i.e., modes of transaction that involve physically taking possession of the item. Evidently, what is defined as money is not fixed. Even coins used in commerce are not always considered currency, but rather a commodity. The principle is that market value is calculated based on the price of silver, and even other coins are considered commodities vis-à-vis silver. At the same time, all coins have the legal status of currency relative to commodities.",

The <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of exploitation do not apply to transactions involving land, slaves, or documents. Rather, exploitation can exist only in transactions involving movable property. There is a minimum measure when considering the question of which transactions constitute exploitation: The disparity between the value of a commodity and its sale price must be at least one <span class=\"it-text\">peruta</span>, and a transaction is exploitive only if the seller overcharged or undercharged the buyer by one-sixth of the item's market value. If the disparity is less than one-sixth, it is a standard transaction, not an exploitive one. If the disparity is greater than one-sixth, the transaction is null and void if either party in the transaction wishes to void it. The one-sixth measure pertains specifically to the value of the items. In cases of exploitation that involve objectively definable features of the commodity, e.g., measure or weight, the transaction is nullified even if the disparity is less than one-sixth. The prohibition and <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of exploitation apply whether it is the seller or the buyer that is exploited, although there is a difference between the buyer and the seller with regard to how long after the transaction he can challenge its validity. Likewise, the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of exploitation apply whether the exploited party is a layman or a merchant, and even if he is an expert merchant.", 
                "The <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> is established that the prohibition of verbal mistreatment is more stringent than the prohibition of exploitation, both because no compensation can be paid for it and because the damage caused by verbal mistreatment is greater. It is impossible to prove whether the verbal mistreatment was intentional, and consequently there is no way to adjudicate the matter in court. Therefore, the sentence of the guilty party is adjudicated in the Heavenly court, whose sentences are more severe. Verbal mistreatment includes any statement that could offend one who hears it, whether it is an insult or a reprimand. Even a remark said jokingly or playfully is included in the prohibition. There is a prohibition against verbally mistreating anyone, but the violation is especially serious if the offended party is disadvantaged, and it is particularly severe when the offended party is a convert, with regard to whose mistreatment there is an explicit Torah prohibition."

From the verse alone it is unclear how and when this applies, but the Gemara explains that in order for the exemption to apply, the owner must be working for the borrower. The discussion in the Gemara analyzes whether the owner needs to be physically involved with his item, or if it is sufficient to be legally bound to the borrower with regard to another task. The Gemara also examines at what point it is necessary for the owner to be working for the borrower in order for the exemption to apply. Is the critical moment the actual borrowing of the item or the time of the mishap; or must the owner be working for the borrower throughout the borrowing period? Does the commencing of the employment of the owner need to take place at the critical moment, or can it precede the borrowing? To this end, and also to define when a borrower or renter bears liability, it is necessary to define the precise moments that the period of borrowing or renting is considered to begin and end, both in the case when the borrower takes charge of the item himself and also when it is passed to him by means of an intermediary.", 
                "As a renter pays for the right to use another person's item, it is obvious that he does not share the same high level of liability borne by a borrower. But the verses detailing the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of a renter are not overly explicit and there is a dispute among the <span class=\"it-text\">tanna'im</span> as to the level of liability he does bear.", 
                "Despite the distinction in the level of liability, it is clear that overall there is a great similarly between renting and borrowing an item, since in both cases the item was taken in order to use it. Indeed, there are many cases where a person initially takes an item as a borrower and later as a renter, or vice versa. Similarly, there are cases where a person borrows one item from an owner while also renting another item from him. Since the level of liability of a borrower and renter are different, it becomes crucial to clarify when the person taking the item is considered to be a borrower and when he is considered to be a renter. The Gemara discusses this question and the protocol in cases in which the two sides dispute the nature of the agreement between them, both in cases where one or both of the parties state claims with certitude and also where they admit that they do not remember what the agreement was. In its discussion of these issues, the Gemara diverts its attention from a narrow discussion of the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of borrowing and renting to a broader discussion of monetary disputes in which the parties involved have some basis to their claims and how to proceed when the court is unable to come to a clear-cut decision with regard to who is entitled to the money.", 
                "The chapter also discusses the rental of houses and the responsibilities and liabilities of the landlord and the renter. This includes what a landlord is expected to provide for his renter and his responsibility in a case in which the house collapses. Additionally, the chapter considers the length of the rental period and from which point and under what circumstances a landlord must provide his renter with notice before evicting him."

If the thief is not found, then the master of the house shall approach the judges, to see whether he has not misappropriated his neighbor's goods. For every matter of sin, whether it is for ox, for donkey, for sheep, for garment, or for any manner of lost item, whereof one says: This is it, the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; he whom the judges shall condemn shall pay double unto his neighbor.

                "One fundamental issue concerns the matter of ownership of the stolen deposit. Is the bailee who compensated the owner for the loss of his item considered the owner of the item immediately? If so, if the thief is found, he returns the item to the bailee and pays him the fine. Or perhaps the depositor remains the owner of the item, and when the thief is located, the owner recieves the item and the fine. The owner then returns to the bailee only the amount of money the bailee gave him as compensation.", 
                "Another question that requires clarification is the essence of safeguarding an item. The bailee commits himself to providing a reasonable level of security for the item, but what is the definition of reasonable here? In a case where the bailee discovers that the deposit is deteriorating over time, does he have the right or obligation to take action to preserve the deposit, or is the obligation of the bailee limited to avoiding misappropriation of the deposit?", 
                "The essence of misappropriation as far as a bailee is concerned requires analysis. Is misappropriation another word for theft perpetrated by the bailee, so that cases of misappropriation are treated like cases of theft? Or is misappropriation a unique halakhic concept that involves betraying the trust of the depositor and breaching their agreement, so that using the deposit is merely the second stage of a betrayal that began with misappropriation? If it is the latter, is the bailee liable for the mere intention to steal the deposit, or is he liable only if he actually stole it?",

Clearly there is a difference between a <span class=\"it-text\">sukka</span> and a house. However, that difference must be defined and elucidated in order to ascertain in practical terms what are the meaning and parameters of the term <span class=\"it-text\">sukka</span>. ", 
                "This primary question can be divided into several independent secondary questions. First, what are the minimum and maximum measures of a <span class=\"it-text\">sukka</span>? Is a <span class=\"it-text\">sukka</span> of any size fit for use in fulfilling the mitzva, or are there certain restrictions in terms of height or area? Second, what is the appropriate structure of a <span class=\"it-text\">sukka</span>? Can it take any form, with any number of walls and any type of configuration, or is a <span class=\"it-text\">sukka</span> fit for use only if it takes a particular form? Third, what material may be used in construction of a <span class=\"it-text\">sukka</span>? Are all materials fit for use, or are certain materials restricted? Further, must the entire <span class=\"it-text\">sukka</span> be constructed from the same material or are there differences between various parts of the <span class=\"it-text\">sukka</span> in that regard? Fourth, how does one build a <span class=\"it-text\">sukka</span>? Are there specific times during which it may be constructed, or may it be constructed at any time? Are there specific <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> or directives governing the method or sequence of construction? Must construction of one section of the <span class=\"it-text\">sukka</span> precede construction of another, or is the order irrelevant? Fifth, what about the location of the <span class=\"it-text\">sukka</span>? May it be constructed anywhere or perhaps, in order for it to be considered a <span class=\"it-text\">sukka</span>, must it be constructed only in certain locations? ",

                "In terms of the height of the <span class=\"it-text\">sukka</span>, there are two significant parameters. A <span class=\"it-text\">sukka</span> may be no less than ten handbreadths high and no more than twenty cubits high. With regard to its area, the <span class=\"it-text\">sukka</span> may be no less than seven by seven handbreadths. There is no upper limit for its area.",

With regard to a square <span class=\"it-text\">sukka</span>, a <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> transmitted to Moses from Sinai says that there must be at least two full-fledged walls that extend the full length of the <span class=\"it-text\">sukka</span> and a third wall that is at least one handbreadth long. There was extensive discussion with regard to a <span class=\"it-text\">sukka</span> whose walls are incomplete, as two of the walls must be actual, conspicuous walls and not merely symbolic walls. Therefore, it was necessary to define what is considered a wall for the purposes of a <span class=\"it-text\">sukka</span>.", 
                "The essence of a <span class=\"it-text\">sukka</span> is its roofing. While the walls may consist of any material, provided that they are sturdy and support the roofing, the roofing must consist of material that grows from the ground and is no longer connected to the ground when placed on the <span class=\"it-text\">sukka</span> and that is not susceptible to ritual impurity. The Sages were stringent with regard to the latter criterion; they prohibited not only the use of complete vessels, but also the use of broken vessels, even though once broken they are no longer susceptible to impurity. Similarly, they prohibited the use of certain objects, e.g., mats, even though their status with regard to becoming ritually impure is indeterminate.", 
                "Even in terms of its construction, the roofing is the essence of the <span class=\"it-text\">sukka</span>. Although halakhically, the construction of a <span class=\"it-text\">sukka</span> has no set time, and one is not required to have specific intention when building it, there is a principle that applies here and in other areas of <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>: Prepare it, and not from that which is already prepared, which requires one to place the roofing after the walls are already standing and to do so with the express intent of using it as roofing. This <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> invalidates a <span class=\"it-text\">sukka</span> whose roofing was placed on a structure for a purpose other than roofing the <span class=\"it-text\">sukka</span> and subsequently declared that it is roofing for a <span class=\"it-text\">sukka</span>.",

                "One fundamental problem was related to the fulfillment of these mitzvot on Shabbat, as, above and beyond the Torah prohibitions, the Sages issued decrees prohibiting several activities on Shabbat. Although most of those decrees were not in effect in the Temple, some were. With regard to the mitzva of the four species, although the mitzva in the Temple was to take the species all seven days, the Sages instituted that even in the Temple, only on the first day does fulfillment of the mitzva override Shabbat, and outside the Temple, it does not override Shabbat at all. Likewise, the Sages determined that the mitzva of the willow branch in the Temple overrides Shabbat only on the seventh day of the Festival. In addition, drawing water for the water libation does not override Shabbat. However, a device was fashioned that enabled the water libation to be poured even on Shabbat.", 
                "Two significant mitzvot were performed in the Temple during the festival of <span class=\"it-text\">Sukkot</span>, the mitzva of the water libation and the mitzva to encircle the altar with willow branches. Neither is written in the Torah; they are traditions transmitted to Moses from Sinai. The mitzva of the water libation was detailed extensively in this chapter: How they drew water from the Siloam pool and how they took it up to be poured on the altar in a procession accompanied by trumpet blasts. In addition, the mitzva of the willow branch in the Temple was detailed extensively, both the surrounding of the altar with upright willow branches and the circling of the altar with willow branches in hand, as were the accompanying pronouncements.", 
                "Another problem addressed in this chapter relates to the Eighth Day of Assembly, which follows the seven days of <span class=\"it-text\">Sukkot</span>. On the one hand, it is characterized as a pilgrim Festival in and of itself, independent of <span class=\"it-text\">Sukkot</span>. However, due to its proximity to the festival of <span class=\"it-text\">Sukkot</span>, several problems arise, e.g., how does one make the transition from one Festival to another without undermining the sanctity and distinctiveness of each? This is even more problematic in the Diaspora, where there is uncertainty whether the Eighth Day of Assembly is actually the seventh day of <span class=\"it-text\">Sukkot</span>. Fundamentally, the Eighth Day of Assembly is a Festival in and of itself in every respect, and one recites the blessing of time at the outset of the Festival. However, with regard to residing in the <span class=\"it-text\">sukka</span>, there are numerous opinions. Even today, there is no firm ruling governing this practice and the custom varies in different areas in the Diaspora. "

                "This chapter was devoted completely to the customs practiced in the Temple during the seven days of the festival of <span class=\"it-text\">Sukkot</span>. The Celebration of Drawing Water was a public event accompanied by great pomp and ceremony. To facilitate that celebration and to ensure that it did not cross the line into immorality, the Sages undertook several special practices to achieve separation between men and women and to ensure that those singing and dancing were prominent Torah luminaries.", 
                "In the discussion of the Celebration of Drawing Water, the general procedures for playing music in the Temple were also discussed. The conclusion was that there are three types of music. Music in the context of the Celebration of Drawing Water, which is to promote extreme rejoicing, was played only during the week, and anyone could participate in playing the musical instruments. Music that accompanied the sacrificial service was played every day, even on Shabbat and Festivals, because it was for the purpose of sacrificing the offerings, and all the more so, the sounding of the <span class=\"it-text\">shofar</span> and the trumpets for the various offerings were performed, as they are a Torah obligation. ", 
                "Since the chapter dealt with the music played at the Celebration of Drawing Water, it also discussed the <span class=\"it-text\">shofar</span> and trumpet blasts that accompanied the offerings throughout the Festival, as well as the blasts sounded throughout the year during the week on Shabbat and Festival eves and at their conclusion.", 
                "Another topic dealt with in this chapter was the division of the additional offerings. The additional offerings on <span class=\"it-text\">Sukkot</span> are more numerous than those on any other Festival; in addition, unlike on other Festivals, the number of offerings sacrificed vary from day to day. Therefore, a special division of labor was required by means of which all the priestly watches, who ascended to Jerusalem to serve during the pilgrim Festivals, would divide the additional offerings among themselves. The objective was to ensure that all the priestly watches would sacrifice an equal number of each type of offering. On a related note, also addressed were several matters concerning the division of the Temple service among the priestly watches on Shabbat and Festivals throughout the year."

Seven days shall you keep a feast unto the Lord your God in the place which the Lord shall choose; because the Lord your God shall bless you in all your increase, and in all the work of your hands, and you shall be altogether joyful. Three times in a year shall all your males appear before the Lord your God in the place which He shall choose; on the festival of Passover, and on <span class=\"it-text\">Shavuot</span>, and on <span class=\"it-text\">Sukkot</span>; and they shall not appear before the Lord empty.

And on the second day you shall present twelve young bulls, two rams, fourteen he-lambs of the first year without blemish. (Numbers 29:12–17)", 
                "There are two elements that characterize the sacred Temple service on the festival of <span class=\"it-text\">Sukkot</span>: Rejoicing and offerings. Those two elements are not unique to this Festival; however, quantitatively and in terms of emphasis, this Festival is indeed unique with regard to those two elements relative to the other Festivals.", 
                "One mitzva that is especially conspicuous during the festival of <span class=\"it-text\">Sukkot</span> is the mitzva of rejoicing. Although there is a mitzva to rejoice on all the Festivals, on the festival of <span class=\"it-text\">Sukkot</span> the mitzva of extreme rejoicing takes center stage. To enhance this mitzva, different innovations and services beyond the standard practice in the Temple were introduced: Musical instruments were played more than on other days, additional lights were added, and in general, ordinances were instituted and other measures were taken to facilitate great rejoicing and at the same time to ensure that it did not become excessive. ", 
                "Another mitzva unique to the festival of <span class=\"it-text\">Sukkot</span> is the myriad additional offerings. Although there is an additional offering sacrificed on every Festival beyond the daily offerings, the sheer number of additional offerings sacrificed on <span class=\"it-text\">Sukkot</span> render it unique. The added offerings and the manner in which they were sacrificed, as well as the division of labor between the various priestly watches, are subject to analysis and elucidation.",

And you shall take for yourselves on the first day the fruit of a beautiful tree, branches of a date palm, and boughs of a dense-leaved tree, and willows of the brook. (Leviticus 23:39–40)", 
                "The Torah verses that command the children of Israel to take the four species on the festival of <span class=\"it-text\">Sukkot</span> raise various questions. The names provided in the Torah are not clearly defined, distinctive names of the species; rather, they are allusions and descriptions. The first question therefore concerns identifying these species. After that initial determination, it is necessary to determine the numerous details with regard to fulfillment of the mitzva. The number and measure of each of the species must be ascertained. Can the mitzva be fulfilled with any one of the species of tree mentioned in the verse, or are there restrictions with regard to the specific tree or part of the tree required? Questions arise with regard to a plethora of minute details. Among them: In what condition must these species be? What precise form must they take? Are there other restrictions with regard to their nature? Can trees that are prohibited for one reason or another be used in fulfilling the mitzva?",

What is the nature and manner of the act of taking them? Must one merely hold them, or is there an additional requirement?", 
                "There is an additional series of questions: Where is the taking of the species performed? Is it an obligation incumbent on each individual everywhere; or is it tied to the sacrificial service in the Temple? Is one obligated to take the species just one day or for all seven days? How many times a day? ",

The Sages interpreted the name homiletically and said that the month is replete with mitzvot, where the word for replete, <span class=\"it-text\">mesuba</span>, is from the same root as<span class=\"it-text\"> hashevi'i</span> (<span class=\"it-text\">Vayikra Rabba </span>29). More specifically, they characterized <span class=\"it-text\">Sukkot </span>as a Festival whose mitzvot are abundant. This wealth of mitzvot is manifest in the Torah in the numerous verses devoted to the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot </span>governing the Festival. However, beyond the mitzvot explicitly mentioned in the Torah, there are additional mitzvot that were received as <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot </span>transmitted to Moses from Sinai, and they too impart a unique character to the Festival. ", 
                "The festival of <span class=\"it-text\">Sukkot </span>is multifaceted, and its <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot </span>are not all associated with only one central theme; rather, there are several themes that differ from those of all other Festivals. In addition to the general mitzvot of a Festival, detailed in tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Beitza</span>, and the mitzvot of the pilgrim Festivals, detailed in tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Hagiga</span>, the festival of <span class=\"it-text\">Sukkot </span>is characterized by its distinctive mitzvot: The mitzva of <span class=\"it-text\">sukka</span>, which entails moving one's residence and dining area; the special ceremony that involves taking the four species; the plethora of additional offerings unique to <span class=\"it-text\">Sukkot</span>; and the mitzvot and special ceremonies performed in the Temple.", 
                "In essence, the festival of <span class=\"it-text\">Sukkot </span>does not commemorate a specific historical event, in contrast to Passover, which commemorates the Exodus, and <span class=\"it-text\">Shavuot</span>, which commemorates the revelation at Sinai. Nor does it correspond to a specific stage in the agricultural cycle, unlike Passover, when the <span class=\"it-text\">omer </span>offering is sacrificed from the new barley crop, and <span class=\"it-text\">Shavuot</span>, when the offering of the two loaves is sacrificed from the new wheat crop. Nevertheless, there is one element that ties together the various, distinct aspects of the Festival: <span class=\"it-text\">Sukkot </span>is the conclusion and summary of the entire year's Festivals. It is both the culmination of the calendar year and the encapsulation of the historical events that comprise the history of the Jewish people. This summation does not entail merely remembering the past and giving thanks, but it also contains prayer for success in the vital, creative year that is beginning. One remembers with gratitude one way of life whose culmination is represented by the festival of <span class=\"it-text\">Sukkot</span>, and one prays for the initiation of a new path that commences with the festival of <span class=\"it-text\">Sukkot</span>.", 
                "The <span class=\"it-text\">sukka </span>does not come to commemorate a particular event; rather, it commemorates the entirety of the experience of the children of Israel in the desert, the life of a people without a country, without claim to land, and without stability. This commemoration includes gratitude for all the miracles of the Exodus that transpired in the past, the clouds of glory, and the contrast between the life of a people wandering in the wilderness and the conclusion of the harvest of the produce of the fields and the trees in Eretz Yisrael. The four species, too, serve on the one hand as a kind of victory procession, celebrating past accomplishments (<span class=\"it-text\">Vayikra Rabba </span>30); and on the other hand taking the four species includes saying a prayer for rainfall and a successful crop in the coming year, the very essence of the mitzva.", 
                "Although the thanksgiving and requests voiced during the festival of <span class=\"it-text\">Sukkot</span> are intimately connected to the Jewish people, they also include a universal theme. Expressing thanks to God for past kindness and prayer and supplication for future success, and likewise, thanksgiving for the past harvest and prayer for rainfall in the coming year, are not unique to the Jewish people. In that sense, the festival of <span class=\"it-text\">Sukkot</span> becomes a Festival for the entire world, as an expression of both thanksgiving and entreaty. Therefore, the Sages associated the seventy bulls sacrificed within the framework of the additional offering on the festival of <span class=\"it-text\">Sukkot</span> with the seventy nations of the world. And the prophet says that the festival of <span class=\"it-text\">Sukkot </span>is the Festival when, in the future, all the people of the world will participate in the pilgrimage to the Temple (see Zechariah 14:16).", 
                "In the verses in the Torah addressing the festival of <span class=\"it-text\">Sukkot</span>, the elements of thanksgiving and rejoicing are conspicuous. Beyond the rejoicing that characterizes all the Festivals, there is a special mitzva of rejoicing on <span class=\"it-text\">Sukkot</span>, to the extent that the name of the Festival coined by the Sages in the prayers recited during the Festival is: The time of our rejoicing. As an extension of the thanksgiving and rejoicing, there are the special mitzvot received as <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot </span>transmitted to Moses from Sinai, which include mention of and prayer for rain and blessing for the coming year. The mitzva of the libation of water on the altar, a central component of the rejoicing of the Festival in the Temple; the mitzva of surrounding the altar with willow branches; and the waving of the willow branch on the seventh day of the Festival all evoke and inspire prayer for rain during the coming year. These are not explicit prayers and are certainly not accompanied by fasting and pleading. Rather, rain is a theme that arises in the course of the great rejoicing. ", 
                "Indeed, though the primary mitzvot of <span class=\"it-text\">Sukkot </span>were elucidated at length in the Torah, most of the discussion in tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Sukka </span>is based on <span class=\"it-text\">halakha </span>transmitted to Moses from Sinai and on tradition, primarily due to the need to translate the verses in the Torah into a structured system of <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> with clearly demarcated limitations. While in many tractates in the Talmud, most of the discussion is dedicated to clarifying the details of the mitzvot or to analyzing the myriad possibilities and intermediate cases, in this tractate the central problems relate to definition of terms. The fundamental concepts associated with the mitzvot of the Festival, e.g., <span class=\"it-text\">sukka</span> and the four species, require precise definitions in terms of determining their essence, size, measures, and the manner of their use. Most of these definitions are learned through the traditions transmitted from previous generations. The significance of tradition is even more conspicuous with regard to those mitzvot of the Festival that have no clear source in the Torah. Specifically because those mitzvot aroused the resistance of the various deviant sects, e.g., Sadducees and Boethusians, the Sages were compelled to greatly underscore their significance.", 
                "Another category of fundamental problems addressed in tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Sukka </span>stems from the contrast between the mitzvot of the Festival practiced in the Temple and those practiced outside the Temple. Although there are some mitzvot associated with <span class=\"it-text\">Sukkot </span>totally independent of the Temple, e.g., the mitzva of <span class=\"it-text\">sukka</span>, and there are others exclusive to the Temple, e.g., the additional offerings, there are many mitzvot associated with <span class=\"it-text\">Sukkot</span> in which there is a special connection between the mitzva and the Temple. Although they are mitzvot whose practice is not limited to the Temple, there is a difference between the practice in the Temple and the practice outside the Temple, e.g., the four species. The problematic nature of these mitzvot while the Temple was standing was exacerbated after its destruction, which severed the connection between the mitzva and the Temple. This led the Sages to institute ordinances to commemorate the Temple, which involved the introduction of many new <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span>.", 
                "Halakhically, the Eighth Day of Assembly is a Festival in and of itself, fundamentally independent of the festival of <span class=\"it-text\">Sukkot</span>, yet it is closely related to <span class=\"it-text\">Sukkot</span> and in a certain sense resembles <span class=\"it-text\">Shavuo</span><span class=\"it-text\">t </span>vis-à-vis Passover. Due to the proximity of the Eighth Day of Assembly and <span class=\"it-text\">Sukkot </span>and due to their similarities, e.g., the Eighth Day of Assembly is also called: The time of our rejoicing, there is a discussion of that Festival within the framework of this tractate. Although not all matters associated with that day are discussed, the basis for the prayer for rain recited on that Festival is located here; it is treated in more detail in tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Ta'anit</span>. In addition, the basis for the custom of future generations to celebrate the conclusion of the cycle of Torah reading on that day, <span class=\"it-text\">Sim</span><span class=\"it-text\">h</span><span class=\"it-text\">at Torah</span>, is discussed.",

                "The second section of the chapter deals with another mitzva, the mitzva of the water libation on the festival of <span class=\"it-text\">Sukkot</span>. This mitzva, in addition to the standard, daily libation of wine, is not written in the Torah; rather, it is a tradition dating back to the revelation at Sinai. However, the general <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> contains within it numerous practical <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span>, and the Gemara explains the procedure in detail: Which water is used? From where is it brought? How is it poured on the altar? What mitzvot accompany this libation?", 
                "Discussion of the mitzva of the four species in the Temple and in the outlying areas as well as a description of the water libation constitute the main focus of this chapter."
