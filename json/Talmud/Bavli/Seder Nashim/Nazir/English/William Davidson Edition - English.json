            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One becomes a nazirite by taking a nazirite vow, in which he simply declares himself a nazirite, as detailed in the Torah (Numbers 6:1–21). Additionally, <b>all substitutes</b> for the language <b>of nazirite vows are like nazirite vows</b> and are binding. Furthermore, intimations of nazirite vows, i.e., incomplete statements that are understood from context to be meant as nazirite vows, are considered binding nazirite vows.",
            "Consequently, <b>one who says: I will be,</b> without further clarification, <b>is a nazirite,</b> as this is his implied intention. <b>Or,</b> if he said: <b>I will be beautiful,</b> he is <b>a nazirite.</b> The substitutes for the language of nazirite vows are as follows: If one says: I will be <b>a <i>nazik</i>,</b> a <b><i>nazi’aḥ</i>,</b> or <b>a <i>pazi’aḥ</i>, he is a nazirite.</b> If one says: <b>I am hereby like this, I am hereby</b> a hair <b>curler, I am hereby growing</b> my <b>hair;</b> or: <b>It is</b> incumbent <b>upon me to grow long hair, he is a nazirite.</b>",
            "If one says: An obligation <b>is hereby</b> incumbent <b>upon me</b> with regard to <b>birds, Rabbi Meir says: He is a nazirite.</b> A nazirite brings two bird-offerings if he inadvertently becomes ritually impure from a corpse (Numbers 6:10), and it is understood that the individual used this indirect phrase to take a vow of naziriteship. <b>And the Sages say: He is not a nazirite.</b>",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara begins by clarifying why this tractate appears in the order of <i>Nashim</i> within the six orders of the Mishna. <b>Now, the <i>tanna</i> is engaged in</b> the study of <b>the order of <i>Nashim</i>,</b> which discusses laws concerning marriage and the resulting obligations as well as with forbidden sexual relations. <b>What</b> then <b>is the reason</b> that he <b>teaches</b> the laws of the <b>nazirite</b> here?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>The <i>tanna</i> is engaged in</b> the study of <b>the verse</b> pertaining to divorce: <b>“Then it comes to pass, if she finds no favor in his eyes, because he has found some unseemly matter about her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1). <b>And this is what he is saying: What caused</b> the woman <b>to</b> commit the <b>transgression</b> of adultery, alluded to in the verse by the phrase “unseemly matter”? It was <b>wine. And</b> the <i>tanna</i> is <b>saying: Anyone who sees a <i>sota</i> in her disgrace should abstain from wine.</b> Consequently, tractate <i>Nazir</i> is placed in the order of <i>Nashim</i>, immediately preceding tractate <i>Sota</i>, which is about a woman suspected by her husband of having been unfaithful, and tractate <i>Gittin</i>, which discusses divorce.",
            "§ The Gemara asks a question with regard to the mishna’s presentation of the different topics it addresses: The <i>tanna</i> <b>began with</b> the statement that all <b>substitutes</b> for the language of nazirite vows are considered nazirite vows, <b>but</b> then it <b>explains</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>intimations</b> of nazirite vows by providing examples of intimations rather than examples of substitutes for nazirite vows. Why didn’t the mishna provide examples of substitutes immediately after stating the <i>halakha</i> concerning substitutes?",
            "<b>Rava said, and some say</b> this statement <b>without attribution [<i>kedi</i>]:</b> The mishna <b>is incomplete and is teaching the following: All substitutes</b> for the language <b>of nazirite vows are like nazirite vows. And</b> similarly, all <b>intimations of nazirite vows are like nazirite vows. And these are</b> examples of <b>intimations: One who says: I will be, is a nazirite.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> nevertheless, <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>explain</b> the cases of <b>substitutes first,</b> before providing examples of intimations, as the <i>halakha</i> of substitutes is mentioned before the <i>halakha</i> of intimations. The Gemara answers: The <b><i>tanna</i></b> employs the general style of the Mishna, which is that <b>the</b> subject <b>with which it concludes is the one that it explains first, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 20b): <b>With what may one light</b> the Shabbat lamp <b>and with what may one not light</b> it? <b>And</b> the mishna <b>explains</b> the details of what <b>one may not light first,</b> before providing examples of fuel that may be used to light the Shabbat lamp.",
            "Similarly, another mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 47b) states: <b>In what may one insulate</b> a pot of cooked food on Shabbat eve, <b>and in what may one not insulate</b> it? <b>And</b> the mishna <b>explains</b> the cases of material in which <b>one may not insulate</b> it <b>first,</b> before providing examples of materials in which one may insulate a pot of cooked food.",
            "A third example of this style is in the following mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 57a): <b>With what</b> items may <b>a woman go out</b> into the public domain on Shabbat <b>and with what</b> items may <b>she not go out? And</b> the mishna <b>explains</b> the items with which <b>a woman may not go out first,</b> before providing examples of items with which she may go out.",
            "The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 51b): <b>With what may an animal go out</b> into the public domain on Shabbat, <b>and with what may it not go out? And it explains</b> the items with which <b>a camel may go out first,</b> before providing examples of items with which it may not go out.",
            "Similarly, it is taught in another mishna (<i>Bava Batra</i> 108a): <b>There are</b> some relatives who <b>inherit and bequeath,</b> e.g., a father and son, who are heirs to each other; some who <b>inherit but do not bequeath;</b> some <b>bequeath but do not inherit;</b> and some <b>do not inherit and do not bequeath. And</b> the mishna <b>explains</b> the cases of <b>those</b> who both <b>inherit and bequeath first,</b> before providing examples of the other categories that were mentioned later in the opening clause of the mishna.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the mishna <b>actually teaches</b> in <b>this</b> manner at times, <b>and</b> it <b>teaches</b> in <b>that</b> manner at other times. There are instances where the <i>tanna</i> begins by elaborating on the first principle mentioned in the mishna, while on other occasions he first elaborates upon the last principle mentioned.",
            "<b>However,</b> there is a rationale as to when the <i>tanna</i> employs each style. <b>There,</b> in the passages concerning the fuels one may use to light the Shabbat lamp, the materials one may use to insulate a pot on Shabbat eve, and the items with which a woman may go out on Shabbat to the public domain, <b>where it is</b> the individual’s <b>own prohibition</b> that is being discussed, the <i>tanna</i> <b>explains</b> the cases pertaining to the individual’s <b>own prohibition first.</b> By contrast, <b>with regard to</b> the mishna that addresses <b>an animal</b> carrying into the public domain on Shabbat, <b>where the prohibition comes by means of</b> the <b>animal,</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>explains</b> what is <b>permitted first.</b>"
        ],
        [
            "Similarly, <b>with regard to</b> the mishna that teaches that <b>there are</b> some relatives who <b>inherit</b> and bequeath, the <i>tanna</i> <b>also</b> had a reason for initially providing examples from the first category: He thereby <b>explains the principal</b> case of the Torah’s <i>halakhot</i> of <b>inheritance first.</b>",
            "The Gemara now returns to its question: <b>But here, let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>explain</b> the cases of <b>substitutes first.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Rather, this is</b> the <b>reason: Since intimations are derived from</b> the <b>exposition</b> of verses and are not explicitly mentioned in the Torah, they are <b>dear to</b> the <i>tanna</i> and he therefore mentions them first.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if that is so, then <b>let him begin with them first</b> in the opening clause of the mishna as well. The Gemara answers: <b>When</b> the <b><i>tanna</i> begins, he begins with the main offering</b> of the nazirite, i.e., with the <i>halakha</i> that has a basis in the Torah. <b>But with regard</b> to the <b>explanation</b> of these <i>halakhot</i>, <b>he explains</b> the cases of <b>intimations first,</b> as he favors that topic.",
            "§ The mishna taught: <b>One who says: I will be, is a nazirite.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Perhaps he is saying: I will be fasting,</b> i.e., his intention is to take a vow that will obligate himself to fast rather than to be a nazirite. The Gemara answers that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The mishna is describing a case <b>where a nazirite was passing before him,</b> so that it is clear that he is taking a nazirite vow.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>Shmuel holds</b> as a principle that <b>ambiguous intimations are not</b> considered <b>intimations,</b> i.e., they are not considered vows? The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>Say</b> that <b>when a nazirite is passing before him, there is no</b> reason <b>to doubt</b> his intention. There is no possibility that he is referring <b>to another matter,</b> and therefore his statement is definitely an intimation of naziriteship. <b>However,</b> it is <b>certainly</b> the case that when <b>a nazirite is not passing before him,</b> and he states: I will be, <b>we say</b> that <b>perhaps he is saying: I will be fasting.</b> It is only in the latter case, where one’s intimation is so ambiguous that it offers no evidence whatsoever of his intentions, that Shmuel holds that one’s statement is not considered a vow.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> even if he made his statement when a nazirite was passing before him, <b>perhaps he was saying</b> that he intends to purchase the animals the nazirite will need for his offerings and thereby <b>exempt</b> the nazirite <b>from</b> paying for <b>his</b> own <b>offerings.</b> The Gemara answers: This is a case <b>where he said in his heart</b> that he accepts upon himself a nazirite vow.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> then <b>what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> this <i>halakha</i>? Isn’t it obvious that he becomes a nazirite? The Gemara answers: It is necessary to state this <i>halakha</i>, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>we require his mouth and heart</b> to be <b>identical.</b> If that were the case, then if one did not clearly articulate his nazirite vow, he would not become a nazirite even if he intended to become one. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that since his words can be interpreted as referring to a nazirite vow, and that was his intention, he becomes a nazirite.",
            "§ The mishna taught that if one says: <b>I will be beautiful [<i>na’e</i>],</b> he is <b>a nazirite.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps</b> when he said: I will be beautiful, he meant: <b>I will be beautiful before Him in mitzvot? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“This is my God and I will glorify Him [<i>anvehu</i>]”</b> (Exodus 15:2). <i>Anvehu</i> has the same root as the word <i>na’e</i>; therefore, the verse means: <b>I will be beautiful before Him in mitzvot.</b> How is this done? <b>I will make before Him a beautiful <i>sukka</i>, a beautiful <i>lulav</i>, beautiful ritual fringes. I will write before Him a beautiful Torah scroll, and I will wrap it in beautiful silk cloths [<i>shira’in</i>].</b>",
            "The Gemara answers that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The mishna is referring to a case <b>where one is holding his hair and says: I will be beautiful.</b> This clearly indicates that he is referring to naziriteship.",
            "The Gemara asks: Since <b>naziriteship</b> is <b>a matter of transgression,</b> can <b>we say about</b> a nazirite that he is <b>beautiful?</b>"
        ],
        [
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, as even according to Rabbi Elazar HaKappar, who said</b> that <b>a nazirite</b> is <b>a sinner, that applies</b> only <b>with regard to a ritually impure nazirite.</b> This is <b>because it is necessary</b> for him <b>to void</b> the days of his vow that have been observed and to begin his term anew, <b>as the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“But the first days will be void, because his consecration was defiled”</b> (Numbers 6:12). <b>It is there</b> that Rabbi Elazar HaKappar called the nazirite a sinner, because <b>perhaps</b> he will <b>come to transgress his naziriteship</b> now that he is a nazirite for a longer period than he originally intended. <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>a ritually pure nazirite,</b> Rabbi Elazar HaKappar <b>does not call him a sinner.</b>",
            "§ The mishna taught that one who says: <b>I am hereby like this,</b> is a nazirite. The Gemara asks: <b>Though</b> this is <b>indeed</b> a case <b>where he is holding his hair</b> at the time, since <b>he did not say: I am hereby like this,</b> how can this statement constitute an acceptance of naziriteship? <b>Shmuel said:</b> It is a case <b>where a nazirite was passing before him</b> when he made his statement. His intention was to declare himself a nazirite like the individual passing before him, and his statement therefore constitutes a nazirite vow.",
            "The mishna rules that one who says: <b>I am hereby a hair curler</b> is a nazirite. The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is it known <b>that this</b> term is referring to the <b>curling [<i>silsul</i>]</b> of <b>hair</b> by allowing it to grow? The Gemara answers: <b>As that maidservant of the house of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to a certain man</b> who grew his hair long: <b>Until when will you curl [<i>mesalsel</i>] your hair?</b> This shows that <i>mesalsel</i> means to grow hair.",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Say</b> that the word <i>mesalsel</i> is referring to the study of <b>Torah, as it is written</b> with regard to Torah: <b>“Extol her [<i>salseleha</i>] and she will exalt you”</b> (Proverbs 4:8). The Gemara responds that <b>Shmuel said: Here too,</b> the case is <b>where he was holding his hair</b> at the time of his pronouncement.",
            "The mishna rules that one who says: <b>I am hereby growing</b> my <b>hair</b> is a nazirite. The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is it known <b>that this</b> term <b>is</b> a reference to <b>growing [<i>kilkul</i>] his hair?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 78b): With regard to the measure that determines liability for carrying out <b>lime</b> on Shabbat from a private to a public domain, <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The measure is <b>equivalent</b> to that which is used <b>to spread on</b> one’s <b><i>kilkul</i>. And Rav said:</b> This is referring to the hair that grows on <b>the areas beneath the temple.</b>",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Say</b> that he vowed to <b>sustain the poor, as it is written: “And Joseph sustained [<i>vaykhalkel</i>] his father and his brethren”</b> (Genesis 47:12). The Gemara responds that <b>Shmuel said: Here too,</b> in the mishna, the case is one <b>where the individual was holding his hair</b> when he made his pronouncement, so that it was clear that he was referring to growing his hair.",
            "The mishna rules that with regard to one who says: <b>It is</b> incumbent <b>upon me to grow [<i>leshale’aḥ</i>] long hair, he is a nazirite.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is it known <b>that this</b> term <b><i>shilu’aḥ</i>,</b> which is a different form of the word <i>leshale’aḥ</i>, <b>is</b> an expression of <b>increase</b> and growth? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “Your tresses [<i>shelaḥayikh</i>] are a park of pomegranates”</b> (Song of Songs 4:13).",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Say</b> that it is referring to <b>a matter</b> involving <b>transfer, as it is written: “And sends [<i>shole’aḥ</i>] water upon the earth”</b> (Job 5:10), where the word <i>shole’aḥ</i> is referring to the transport of water from one place to another. Here too, the individual taking the vow might mean that he intends to transfer, i.e., to remove, his hair.",
            "The Gemara answers: The <b><i>tanna</i> derives</b> the meaning of this term based upon a verbal analogy of the term <b>long locks [<i>pera</i>]</b> written with regard to a nazirite and the term <b>long locks [<i>pera</i>]</b> written with regard to a priest. <b>It is written here,</b> with regard to a nazirite: <b>“He shall be holy, he shall let the</b> hair of his head <b>grow [<i>gadel</i>] long locks [<i>pera</i>]”</b> (Numbers 6:5). <b>And it is written there, with regard to a common priest</b> serving in the Temple: <b>“And they will not let their locks grow long [<i>pera lo yeshaleḥu</i>]”</b> (Ezekiel 44:20). Just as the word <i>pera</i> with regard to a nazirite indicates growing long hair, so too, in the case of a priest it is referring to growing long hair. This proves that the term <i>shilu’aḥ</i> means letting one’s hair grow.",
            "The Gemara offers an alternate answer: <b>And if you wish, say</b> that the meaning of the word <i>shole’aḥ</i> in <b>that</b> phrase: <b>Sends [<i>shole’aḥ</i>] water, is also increase</b> and growth, <b>as Rav Yosef translated</b> this verse into Aramaic in the following manner: <b>When one waters produce, it grows.</b> Consequently, the verse is referring to growth by means of water.",
            "§ The mishna taught that if one says: An obligation <b>is hereby</b> incumbent <b>upon me</b> with regard to <b>birds, Rabbi Meir says: He is a nazirite,</b> and the Sages say: He is not a nazirite. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir? Reish Lakish said: He accepted upon himself</b> an obligation with regard to the <b>birds</b> that are <b>juxtaposed</b> in a verse <b>to hair, as it is written: “Until his hair was grown like eagles’ feathers, and his nails like birds’ claws”</b> (Daniel 4:30). Since the verse juxtaposes birds with growing hair, it is understood that when this individual accepted an obligation with regard to birds, he was referring to growing his hair as a nazirite.",
            "The Gemara explains the basis of the dispute: <b>Rabbi Meir holds</b> that <b>a person associates</b> the object of his vow with <b>something that is juxtaposed</b> to it in a verse, so that when he says that it is incumbent upon him to bring birds, he means that it is incumbent upon him to grow his hair."
        ],
        [
            "<b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>a person does not associate</b> the object of his vow with <b>something that is juxtaposed to it</b> in a verse, and the individual did not mean to take a nazirite vow.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Everyone</b> agrees that one <b>does not associate</b> the object of his vow with something juxtaposed to it in a verse. <b>Rather, this is the reason of Rabbi Meir: We are concerned</b> that <b>perhaps he accepted upon himself the birds of an impure nazirite.</b> Since an impure nazirite must bring two birds as offerings if he inadvertently becomes impure from a corpse (Numbers 6:10), when the individual accepts upon himself an obligation pertaining to birds, he means that he is becoming a nazirite and will be responsible for bringing an offering of birds if he becomes impure.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Since</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said</b> that, even according to Rabbi Meir, <b>we are concerned</b> that the individual intended to become a nazirite, but it is not clear that this was his intention, it can be argued that <b>perhaps he accepted upon himself a gift</b> offering of birds as a burnt-offering. Consequently, why is he considered a nazirite? The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> it was <b>so,</b> that his intention was to bring a gift offering, <b>he should have</b> said: <b>It is hereby</b> incumbent <b>upon</b> me to bring <b>a nest,</b> which is the common expression used to accept an obligation to bring a gift offering of birds.",
            "The Gemara asks further: <b>But perhaps he</b> was <b>saying: It is</b> incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring the <b>birds of a leper,</b> rendering himself liable to bring a leper’s offerings on a leper’s behalf (see Leviticus 14:4). The Gemara answers: This is a case <b>where a nazirite was passing before him</b> when he spoke, and he clearly had naziriteship in mind. The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps</b> it was <b>an impure nazirite, and he</b> was <b>saying</b> that he accepts the obligation <b>to exempt</b> the nazirite <b>from his offerings</b> by sacrificing them on the nazirite’s behalf. The Gemara answers: This is a case <b>where a pure nazirite was passing before him.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the difference <b>between</b> the opinions of Reish Lakish and Rabbi Yoḥanan? After all, according to both explanations it is necessary to say that this is a case where a nazirite was passing before him.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> in a case <b>where he</b> explicitly <b>said:</b> An obligation is hereby incumbent <b>upon me</b> with regard to <b>the birds juxtaposed</b> in the verse <b>to hair. According to Rabbi Yoḥanan, although he said this, if a nazirite was passing before him, yes,</b> Rabbi Meir considers it a nazirite vow; <b>if not, no,</b> it is not considered a nazirite vow. Conversely, <b>according to Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, although no nazirite was passing before him,</b> Rabbi Meir considers it a nazirite vow, as he holds that according to Rabbi Meir, one associates the object of his vow with something juxtaposed to it in a verse.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Is there,</b> in fact, <b>anyone who says</b> that <b>a person does not associate</b> the object of his vow with <b>something juxtaposed to it</b> in a verse? <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that in the case of <b>one who says: Right [<i>yamin</i>], that is</b> an expression of <b>an oath? What is the reason</b> for this? Is it <b>not because it is written: “When he lifted up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and swore by Him that lives forever”</b> (Daniel 12:7)? It seems evident that the term “right” indicates an oath merely because in the verse it is juxtaposed to an oath.",
            "The Gemara rejects this: <b>Say no,</b> it is <b>because</b> the <b>right</b> hand <b>itself is called an oath, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> in the case of <b>one who says: Right, that it is an oath?</b> It is derived from the verse where it <b>is stated: “The Lord has sworn by His right hand”</b> (Isaiah 62:8). <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> in the case of <b>one who says: Left, that it is an oath?</b> It is derived from the continuation of that verse, where it <b>is stated: “And by the arm of His strength”</b> (Isaiah 62:8). Since this is the complementary phrase for the right hand, it must refer to the left hand. It is clear from here that both right and left are themselves expressions of an oath and do not indicate an oath merely because they are juxtaposed in a verse to an expression of an oath.",

And all details of naziriteship</b> are incumbent <b>upon him.</b> Not only does the prohibition he mentioned take effect, he is bound by all of the strictures of naziriteship.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> One <b>is not obligated</b> as a nazirite <b>until he vows</b> that <b>all</b> items and actions forbidden to a nazirite are forbidden <b>to</b> him. <b>And the Rabbis say: Even if he vowed</b> to abstain <b>from only one of them, he is a nazirite.</b>",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon? The verse states</b> with regard to a nazirite: “All the days of his naziriteship he shall not eat <b>from anything that is made of the grapevine, from pits to grape skin”</b> (Numbers 6:4), which indicates that his vow of naziriteship must include all the prohibitions of a nazirite. The Gemara continues to clarify: <b>And</b> according to <b>the Rabbis, what is the reason</b> that he becomes a nazirite even if he specified only one of the prohibitions of a nazirite? <b>The verse states: “He shall abstain from wine and strong drink”</b> (Numbers 6:3). This implies that even if one vows to abstain only from wine and strong drink, all of the <i>halakhot</i> of a nazirite take effect.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And also</b> according to <b>Rabbi Shimon, isn’t it written “he shall abstain from wine and strong drink”?</b> The Gemara answers: Rabbi Shimon <b>requires that</b> verse <b>to prohibit</b> a nazirite from drinking <b>wine</b> that is consumed for <b>a mitzva</b> just <b>as</b> he is prohibited from drinking <b>wine</b> whose consumption is <b>optional.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> wine that is consumed for a mitzva? Is it the wine of <b><i>kiddush</i> and <i>havdala</i>?</b>"

        [
            "<b>He is already sworn and obligated about it from Mount Sinai,</b> i.e., he is obligated by Torah law to keep the <i>halakhot</i> of naziriteship, and therefore it is obvious that he may not drink wine from <i>kiddush</i> or <i>havdala</i>, as drinking the wine is required by rabbinic law (Rambam).",
            "<b>Rather,</b> it is <b>like that which Rava said:</b> If one said: I hereby take <b>an oath that I will drink</b> wine, <b>and he then said: I am hereby a nazirite,</b> the <b>naziriteship comes</b> and <b>applies to the</b> subject of his <b>oath.</b> Although drinking wine is a mitzva for him due to his oath, his naziriteship supersedes the previous oath and renders it prohibited for him to drink wine.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>the Rabbis also, isn’t</b> the verse <b>needed to prohibit</b> to a nazirite <b>wine</b> that is consumed as <b>a mitzva,</b> just <b>like wine</b> whose consumption is <b>optional?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> that is <b>so, let the verse say</b> only “he shall abstain <b>from wine”</b> (Numbers 6:3). <b>What</b> is the purpose of the additional phrase <b>“and strong drink”?

            "The Gemara explains: <b>And Rabbi Shimon</b> could respond to this argument as follows: <b>This is the reason that</b> the verse <b>writes “strong drink”:</b> It is <b>to teach</b> a verbal analogy between <b>“strong drink”</b> written here and <b>“strong drink”</b> written <b>with regard to</b> entering and performing service in <b>the Temple, as it is written</b> that Aaron the priest was commanded: <b>“Do not drink wine or strong drink, you nor your sons with you,</b> when you go into the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 10:9). This teaches: <b>Just as with a nazirite, it is wine</b> alone <b>that is forbidden but other beverages</b> are <b>not</b> forbidden, <b>so too, with regard to</b> the <b>Temple, it is wine that is forbidden</b> to priests, <b>but other intoxicating beverages</b> are <b>not</b> forbidden to them.",
            "<b>And</b> this is <b>to the exclusion of</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If one <b>ate a dried fig from Ke’ila, and</b> similarly if one <b>drank honey or</b> if one drank <b>milk,</b> which can dull the senses, <b>and entered the Temple, he is liable</b> for violating the prohibition against strong drink.",
            "The Gemara suggests a different reason for the inclusion of the term “strong drink,” according to Rabbi Shimon. <b>If you wish, say</b> instead that it is necessary because <b>Rabbi Shimon does not</b> generally <b>accept</b> the principle that <b>a prohibition takes effect upon</b> a preexisting <b>prohibition.</b>",
            "<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: One who eats an animal carcass on Yom Kippur is exempt</b> from the punishment of <i>karet</i> for eating on Yom Kippur. It is prohibited to eat an animal carcass, and therefore the additional prohibition against eating on Yom Kippur does not take effect with regard to it. The inclusion of the term “strong drink” alludes to the fact that with regard to naziriteship, a second prohibition does take effect. Consequently, if one took an oath not to drink wine and afterward vowed to be a nazirite, both prohibitions apply.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And also</b> according to <b>the Rabbis, isn’t it written: “Anything that is made of the grapevine”</b> (Numbers 6:4), which seems to indicate, as stated by Rabbi Shimon, that one becomes a nazirite only if he vows to accept all the prohibitions of a nazirite? The Gemara answers: <b>The Rabbis</b> could have <b>said to you: There</b> the verse <b>taught</b> that <b>the prohibitions of a nazirite combine with each other.</b> In other words, if a nazirite eats less than an olive-bulk of both grape skins and grape seeds, but together they amount to an olive-bulk, he receives lashes for transgressing a Torah prohibition.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>And Rabbi Shimon</b> does not interpret the verse in this manner because <b>he does not hold</b> that there is a need for the <b>combination</b> of quantities of different foods in order to render one liable to receive lashes, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> Even <b>the smallest quantity</b> of forbidden food is sufficient to render one liable <b>to</b> receive <b>lashes.</b> The Sages <b>stated</b> the measurement of <b>an olive-bulk only with regard to</b> the obligation to bring <b>an offering.</b> Consequently, in the case of a nazirite, who is not obligated to bring a sin-offering if he inadvertently eats grape products, there is no need for a special verse to teach that the different foods add up to the measurement of an olive-bulk. Therefore, the purpose of the verse must be to teach about the nature of a nazirite vow.",

            "<b>Bar Padda said:</b> The number of days of an unspecified naziriteship <b>corresponds</b> to the number of appearances of the words <b>“nazirite,” “his naziriteship,”</b> and similar terms <b>that are stated in the Torah</b> in the chapter of naziriteship (Numbers, chapter 6): <b>Thirty less one</b> times. So too, an unspecified term of naziriteship is twenty-nine days.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And Rav Mattana should also derive from</b> the number of times that the words <b>“nazirite”</b> and <b>“his naziriteship”</b> appear, to conclude like bar Padda that an unspecified naziriteship lasts for twenty-nine days.",
            "The Gemara answers: Rav Mattana could have <b>said to you: That</b> word is needed <b>for</b> a specific <b>exposition.</b> The words: <b>“He shall abstain [<i>yazir</i>] from wine and strong drink”</b> (Numbers 6:3), comes <b>to prohibit</b> a nazirite from drinking <b>wine</b> that is consumed for <b>a mitzva</b> just <b>as</b> he is prohibited from drinking <b>wine</b> whose consumption is <b>optional.</b> Likewise, the words: “When either man or woman <b>shall clearly utter a vow, the vow of a nazirite, to consecrate himself”</b> (Numbers 6:2), <b>teach that</b> one vow of <b>naziriteship takes effect where</b> another vow of <b>naziriteship</b> already exists. For example, if one takes a vow by stating: I will be a nazirite today, and then repeats the vow, he must observe two periods of naziriteship. Consequently, since sometimes the word nazirite, in its different forms, appears in order to serve as the source of a particular exposition, the number of times it occurs does not indicate the length of an unspecified term of naziriteship."

Consequently, he may shave his hair <i>ab initio</i> only after thirty days have passed.",

The Gemara answers: He <b>holds</b> that the legal status of <b>part of the day is like</b> that <b>of an entire</b> day.

            "The Gemara responds that Rav Mattana can explain Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion as follows: This does not prove that an unspecified term of naziriteship is less than thirty days, as <b>Rabbi Eliezer holds</b> that the legal status of <b>part of the day is like</b> that <b>of an entire</b> day, and it is viewed as though the nazirite has completed his term of naziriteship at the start of the thirtieth day.",

            "The Gemara responds: <b>Rav Mattana</b> could have <b>said to you: Everyone</b> agrees that <b>we require</b> a term of naziriteship to last at least <b>thirty</b> days, <b>and here they disagree with regard to</b> whether <b>“until”</b> means <b>until and including.

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Does a cow speak?</b> What is the meaning of the statement: A cow said: I am hereby a nazirite? <b>Rami bar Ḥama said: With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where there was a prone cow before him,</b> and he tried, without success, to cause it to stand, <b>and he said: This cow thinks it</b> will <b>not stand; I am hereby a nazirite</b> and therefore will refrain <b>from its flesh if it stands of its own accord, and</b> in fact <b>it stood of its own accord. Beit Shammai follow their</b> standard <b>approach and Beit Hillel follow their</b> standard <b>approach.</b>",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>Beit Shammai, who say</b> that one who vows to be a nazirite and therefore will refrain <b>from dried figs and from cakes of dried figs is a nazirite,</b> say that <b>here too, when he says: I am hereby a nazirite</b> and therefore will refrain <b>from its flesh, is a nazirite.</b> Since one does not utter a statement for naught, he is held to the first part of his statement: I am hereby a nazirite, and the words: And therefore will refrain from its flesh, are disregarded. <b>And Beit Hillel say: He is not a nazirite.</b>",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> if Rami bar Ḥama is correct, <b>didn’t Beit Shammai</b> already <b>say this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>one time?</b> According to Rami bar Ḥama’s explanation, this mishna and the previous one differ only with regard to the examples provided, but the principle is identical. <b>Rava said:</b> It is normal for the Sages to cite <b>two</b> or <b>three</b> examples from different cases that offer novel perspectives, although they essentially reflect the same principle. <b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya also taught two</b> or <b>three</b> examples with regard to this same issue. <b>And Rabbi Oshaya also said two</b> or <b>three</b> examples.",
            "<b>And</b> all these cases <b>are necessary, as, if it were stated</b> only that he is a nazirite <b>in this</b> case of <b>dried figs and cakes of dried figs,</b> it could have been said that it is only <b>there that Beit Shammai say he is a nazirite, since</b> figs <b>are confused with grapes,</b> and it is reasonable to assume that he had grapes in mind. <b>But meat is</b> certainly <b>not confused with grapes,</b> and it could be that in the case of the mishna he is not a nazirite even according to Beit Shammai. <b>And if it were stated</b> only that he is a nazirite where he vowed that <b>meat</b> was forbidden to him, it could have been said that <b>it is here that Beit Shammai say he is a nazirite</b> because he was referring to the often-paired <b>meat and wine,</b> and it is reasonable to assume that he might have had wine in mind. <b>But dried figs and cakes of dried figs</b> are not paired with wine, so he should <b>not</b> be a nazirite. To counter that claim, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that he is a nazirite in both cases.",
            "<b>And if it were stated</b> only that he is a nazirite with regard to <b>these two</b> cases of figs and meat, it could be said: It is in <b>these</b> cases <b>that Beit Shammai say</b> he is a nazirite, <b>but</b> in the case of <b>a door, I will say they concede to Beit Hillel</b> that such a statement certainly does not constitute a vow of naziriteship.

            "After providing the answer to one difficulty raised against Rami bar Ḥama’s explanation, Rava presents another problem. <b>Rava said: Is</b> the mishna <b>teaching: If it stood of its own accord?</b> The mishna states: If it stands, and does not mention the condition of: On its own accord. <b>Rather, Rava said:</b> The mishna is referring to a case <b>where there was a prone cow before him, and he said: It is</b> incumbent <b>upon me to bring</b> it as a nazirite <b>offering,</b> and in this way the individual accepts naziriteship upon himself. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Granted, a cow</b> can <b>be an offering, but</b> can <b>a door be an offering?</b> How can his vow that a door should be an offering be considered an acceptance of naziriteship? <b>Rather, Rava said</b> it means the following: It is a case <b>where there was a prone cow before him</b> refusing to stand,"

            "The Gemara offers another explanation: <b>Rather,</b> the mishna is referring to a case <b>where he said: I am hereby a nazirite</b> and therefore will refrain <b>from its flesh if it does not stand, and it stood of its own accord.

        [
            "<b>Go out and betroth a woman for me, without specifying</b> a particular woman; from that moment onward the one who appointed the agent is <b>forbidden to all the women in the world</b> until he finds out which woman the agent betrothed.

            "<b>Reish Lakish raised an objection to Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> from a mishna (<i>Kinnim</i> 2:1): With regard to an impure person who comes to undergo his purification process, and for this purpose set aside <b>an unspecified nest,</b> meaning a pair of turtledoves or pigeons, to use for his offerings. One is to be a burnt-offering and one is to be a sin-offering, and he had not yet specified which bird will be used for which offering. If <b>one fledgling of the</b> pair <b>flew away</b> and escaped <b>to the</b> open <b>air of the world, or</b> if it <b>flew among</b> birds invalidated for <b>sin-offerings that</b> have been left to <b>die, or if one of them died,</b> in each of these cases the owner of the nest <b>purchases a partner for the second,</b> i.e., remaining, bird. At that point he may decide which is for a sin-offering and which is for a burnt-offering.",
            "<b>But</b> if a fledgling flew away or died from <b>a specified nest,</b> after the owner had designated which bird would be used for which offering, and it is not known which bird escaped, <b>it has no</b> means of <b>remedy.</b> This is because he does not know whether the remaining fledgling is for a burnt-offering or a sin-offering.",
            "Reish Lakish infers: <b>But generally, other nests</b> belonging to other people are <b>fit;</b> there is no concern with regard to them. Reish Lakish states his objection to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan: According to your opinion that there is a concern that each woman might be a relative of the woman the agent betrothed, <b>then why</b> should the <i>halakha</i> with regard to nests be so? <b>Let us</b> likewise <b>say</b> with regard to <b>each and every</b> fledgling bird in the world that <b>perhaps this is the one</b> that was consecrated and flew away. How can anyone ever use a bird for their own offering, as it may be the bird that flew away from someone else’s nest?",
            "Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to</b> Reish Lakish: <b>I state</b> my opinion that there is a concern for other women only with regard to <b>a woman, who does not move</b> but is fixed in her home. An unidentified item is presumed to have the same legal status as the majority of items like it, and there is no concern that it may be forbidden, even if there are some forbidden items like it. However, if this unidentified item was fixed in its place, there is an equal presumption that it may belong to the class of similar permitted items or to the class of similar forbidden items. Consequently, all women in the world are forbidden to him, as there is an equal presumption that she may or may not be a relative of the woman that the agent betrothed to him. <b>And you speak to me</b> of <b>a prohibition that moves</b> and is not fixed. Since the fledgling bird is not fixed in one spot, the majority is followed and the minority is ignored.",
            "<b>And if you would say: Here too,</b> she <b>moves,</b> since it is possible to <b>say that</b> the agent <b>found</b> the woman <b>in the marketplace and betrothed her</b> there to the one who appointed the agent, so the prohibited woman was not in a fixed location? Nevertheless, <b>there</b> she eventually <b>returns to her</b> place of <b>rest,</b> i.e., her home, and is therefore considered to be fixed. Conversely, <b>with regard to a nest, does</b> the fledgling <b>return</b> to a fixed place? Since it does not, the assumption is that any bird has the status of the majority of birds in the world, which have not been consecrated as offerings.",
            "<b>Rava said: And Rabbi Yoḥanan concedes</b> that with regard to <b>a woman who does not have a daughter, nor a daughter of a daughter, nor a daughter of a son, nor a mother, nor a mother of a mother, nor a sister</b> who was single when he appointed the agent, that the one who appointed the agent may betroth her. There is no concern that the agent might have betrothed a relative that would now render such a woman forbidden. <b>And even though she had,</b> when he appointed the agent, a married <b>sister,</b> or daughter, or other female relative, <b>and she was later divorced,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan concedes <b>that this</b> woman whom he wishes to now marry is <b>permitted.</b>",
            "<b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is <b>that at that moment, when he told</b> the agent to go betroth a woman on his behalf, these women <b>were married to men.</b> There is a principle that <b>when one appoints an agent,</b> he does so only <b>with regard to a matter present before him.</b> In other words, he instructs his agent to betroth a woman who is available at that time, but <b>he does not appoint an agent with regard to a matter that is not present before him.</b> Consequently, even if the agent betrothed one of the relatives of the woman after they were divorced, the betrothal would not take effect because he was not authorized to betroth them, and therefore the one who appointed the agent is permitted to the woman.",
            "The Gemara now proceeds to raise a difficulty against this last argument from the mishna: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna that if one says: <b>I am hereby a nazirite and it is</b> incumbent <b>upon me to shave a nazirite, and another heard</b> him <b>and said: And I</b> am hereby a nazirite, <b>and it is</b> incumbent <b>upon me to shave a nazirite, if they are perspicacious they shave each other; and if not, they shave other nazirites.</b> According to the reasoning that one takes into account only that which is possible at the time, the following difficulty arises: <b>Granted, the last</b> person <b>has the first one before him</b> and may have had in mind to volunteer to pay for the other’s offerings; <b>but</b> with regard to <b>the first</b> person, <b>is the last one before him?</b> When the first one stated his vow, the other one was not yet a nazirite, and he could not have been taking him into account when he vowed to pay for the offerings of another. How can paying for the offerings of the second nazirite be considered a fulfillment of his vow?"
        ],
        [
            "<b>Rather,</b> it can be explained that <b>this is what he is saying: If I find</b> someone <b>who becomes a nazirite, I will shave him. Here too,</b> in the case of betrothal, <b>this is what</b> the one who appointed the agent <b>is saying to</b> the agent: Even <b>if</b> the woman <b>you find</b> is married at this moment but when you come to her you discover that she <b>has</b> been <b>divorced</b> in the meantime, <b>betroth</b> her <b>to me.</b> If so, he would be prohibited from marrying her sister, contrary to the ruling of Rava.",
            "The Gemara rejects this comparison: The Sages <b>say</b> that there is a distinction between the two cases: <b>A person appoints an agent only for a matter that he</b> himself <b>can perform now,</b> at the time of the appointment, <b>but for a matter that he cannot perform now, he does not appoint</b> an agent. Consequently, the agent cannot betroth a woman who was married at the time of his appointment. The one who appointed the agent may therefore marry the sister of the recently divorced woman, as stated by Rava.",
            "The Gemara asks another question on the ruling of Rava: <b>And</b> can one <b>not</b> appoint an agent to betroth a woman in this manner? <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i> that indicates the contrary: <b>One who says to the steward [<i>apotropos</i>] of his</b> affairs: <b>All vows that my wife will vow from now until I come from such and such a place, nullify for her, and</b> the steward <b>nullified</b> them <b>for her,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought <b>they are nullified.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Her husband sustains</b> the vow <b>and her husband nullifies</b> the vow” (Numbers 30:14); this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yoshiya.</b> The repetition of “husband” teaches that it is the husband alone who may nullify his wife’s vows. <b>And Rabbi Yonatan says: We have found in all places that</b> the legal status of <b>a person’s agent is like</b> that of <b>himself.</b> Therefore, a steward, who serves as the husband’s agent, may nullify the wife’s vows.",
            "Even according to Rabbi Yoshiya, who maintains that the steward cannot nullify her vows, <b>the reason is that the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“Her husband sustains</b> the vow <b>and her husband nullifies</b> the vow,” <b>but if</b> it were <b>not so,</b> the <b>steward could nullify</b> even the future vows of the wife. <b>However, with regard to</b> the husband <b>himself</b> it <b>is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Nedarim</i> 75a): <b>One who says to his wife: All vows that you will vow from now until I come from such and such a place shall be ratified, he has not said anything.</b> However, if a husband says: All vows that you will vow from now until I come from such and such a place, <b>they are hereby nullified, Rabbi Eliezer says: It is nullified, and the Rabbis say: It is not nullified.</b>",
            "The Gemara finishes the question: <b>It enters our mind</b> to say that <b>when Rabbi Yoshiya said</b> that the steward cannot nullify the vows, he spoke <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say</b> that the husband <b>is not able to nullify</b> her vows ahead of time, <b>and</b> yet, even according to their approach, <b>if the Merciful One had not stated</b> in the Torah: <b>“Her husband sustains</b> the vow <b>and her husband nullifies</b> the vow” the <b>steward would</b> be able to <b>nullify</b> such vows. This proves that one can appoint an agent for something he himself cannot do at the time, which contradicts the statement of Rava.",
            "The Gemara rejects this: <b>And perhaps</b> Rabbi Yoshiya spoke <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who says</b> the husband <b>can nullify</b> the vows ahead of time, and it is for this reason that he can appoint the steward to do the same. The Gemara rejects this: <b>If so, why do I</b> need <b>to make him into an agent; let him nullify</b> the future vows <b>for her</b> before he sets out on his journey. The Gemara answers: <b>He thinks, perhaps I will forget, or become angry, or be occupied</b> with other matters when I am about to set out on my journey. This is why he appoints an agent to nullify the vows on his behalf, and no proof can be derived from this <i>baraita</i>.",

Ten days are insufficient for hair growth. Therefore, he must observe a full thirty-day term of naziriteship after the second term of naziriteship, which means he is not a nazirite for the first twenty days. With that assumption in mind, the question arose: <b>Certainly</b> if he vows to be <b>a nazirite</b> for <b>one hundred days, since he has</b> a further <b>eighty days at the end,</b> which is sufficient time for his hair to grow, do the first twenty days <b>count for him</b> as part of the one hundred days <b>or not?</b>",

            "<b>If you say: Here,</b> with regard to cases of a standard permanent naziriteship after twenty days, <b>since</b> it <b>is possible to request</b> of a halakhic authority to dissolve the vow, which would result in the first term of naziriteship taking full effect, it therefore <b>takes effect</b> during those twenty days, then the following question arises: If one <b>said: I am hereby a nazirite</b> like <b>Samson after twenty days, and from now</b> I am hereby <b>a nazirite without specification, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Since <b>here it is not possible to request</b> of a halakhic authority to dissolve the vow of naziriteship like Samson, and there is no way of completing the first term of naziriteship, <b>does</b> the first naziriteship <b>take effect or not?</b> The Gemara adds another question: If one <b>said:</b> I am hereby <b>like Moses on the seventh</b> day <b>of Adar, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is this considered an expression of naziriteship in that just as Moses passed away on that date and drank no more wine, so too, the speaker vows to be a nazirite? Alternatively, perhaps this phrase does not indicate the acceptance of naziriteship.",
            "The Gemara comments: At least <b>resolve the first of these</b> questions, the one raised at the beginning of the discussion, as it is stated explicitly in the <i>Tosefta</i> (2:5): If one says: <b>I am hereby a nazirite after twenty days, and</b> I am hereby a nazirite <b>from now</b> for <b>one hundred days, he counts twenty</b> days of his term of naziriteship immediately, <b>after which he counts thirty</b> days for the subsequent term of naziriteship, <b>and afterward he counts eighty</b> days <b>in order to complete</b> his <b>first</b> term of <b>naziriteship.</b>",

The mishna ruled that he begins his term of naziriteship, and if he has a son during that term, he pauses from that term of naziriteship and starts the term for his son, after which he completes the first term. The Torah states that a nazirite who becomes impure while observing his term of naziriteship must start counting afresh, which leads to the following question: What happens if <b>he became impure during the days of</b> his term of naziriteship for <b>his son? Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> This <b>negates</b> all of it, even the days he has counted for his own term of naziriteship, and he must observe two full terms of naziriteship. <b>Reish Lakish says: This does not negate</b> the days he observed for his own term of naziriteship, only those of the term of naziriteship for his son.",

            "The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach this dispute in both cases. <b>As, if it were stated in this first one,</b> with regard to one who became impure during his term of naziriteship for the birth of his son, one might say that it is specifically <b>in that</b> case that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said it</b> also <b>negates</b> the days of his standard naziriteship because <b>there is one label of naziriteship</b> that applies to both vows, <b>but in this</b> case, where the leper became impure from a corpse, one might <b>say he concedes to Reish Lakish</b> that it does not negate the days of his naziriteship that he has counted, <b>since a nazirite is discrete and leprosy is discrete.</b>",
            "<b>And</b> conversely, <b>if it were stated</b> only <b>in this</b> case, that of the leper who contracted impurity from a corpse, one might say that it is only <b>in this</b> case that <b>Reish Lakish said</b> it does not negate his days of naziriteship, <b>but in that</b> case, where one became impure while observing the term of naziriteship for his son, one might <b>say he concedes to Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> that it negates the entire period, since they are all days of naziriteship. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> for the dispute to be taught in both cases.",
            "In connection with the dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish, the Gemara discusses the case of a nazirite <b>who became impure on the day of</b> his <b>hair growth.</b> The case is that of one who contracted leprosy during his naziriteship and then was purified from his condition and shaved, as required of him. At this point he must wait another thirty days so that his hair can grow enough for him to shave it for the end of his naziriteship. If he became impure during this additional period, <b>Rav said: It does not negate</b> the days he previously counted for his naziriteship. The Gemara explains: <b>Even according to Rabbi Yoḥanan, who says</b> that if one became impure during the days of the term of naziriteship for his son it <b>negates</b> the entire period, <b>this statement</b> applies only <b>where he</b> still <b>remains in</b> a period of <b>naziriteship,</b> but the time of <b>hair growth is an addition to</b> his period of <b>naziriteship</b> and is not considered part of the term itself.",
            "<b>And Shmuel said:</b> It <b>negates</b> the earlier days. The Gemara explains: <b>Even according to Reish Lakish, who says</b> that becoming impure during the naziriteship for his son <b>does not negate</b> the days of his naziriteship, <b>there</b> it is referring to a case of <b>two</b> distinct terms of <b>naziriteship,</b> a standard one for himself and another for his son. But <b>here</b> it is <b>one naziriteship,</b> since the days he observes for the growth of his hair complete his naziriteship.",
            "§ <b>Rav Ḥisda said: All concede that if the hair was consecrated</b> during the sprinkling <b>of the blood, he has no</b> means of <b>remedy.</b> That is, if the nazirite had completed his term and brought his offerings, and the blood of the offerings was sprinkled, and he then became impure before shaving, he has no way to shave or to render wine permitted to himself. It has not been permitted through the offerings he brought because he has become impure, and he cannot bring other offerings for this purpose since one may not bring two sets of offerings for the same term of naziriteship.",

The reason is that since she was pure when they slaughtered the Paschal offering on her behalf, she has fulfilled the obligation of the offering, despite the fact that she became impure and was unable to eat the offering.",
            "The Gemara clarifies this: <b>What is the rationale of Rabbi Yosei</b> for his opinion that she is exempt from observing the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>? <b>Isn’t it because he holds</b> that the legal status of <b>part of the day is like</b> that <b>of an entire</b> day?

The Gemara rejects this: <b>From where</b> do you know that this is the rationale? <b>Perhaps</b> it is <b>because</b> Rabbi Yosei <b>holds</b> that <b>one becomes impure from now and onward.</b> He holds that the impurity of a <i>zava</i> starts only from the moment she had a discharge of blood, but she is ritually pure up to that point, so she was ritually pure when they slaughtered the offering for her.",
            "The Gemara questions this explanation: <b>And does Rabbi Yosei hold</b> in accordance with <b>this</b> ruling that she is impure only from that moment onward?",

It must be that the reason why they are nevertheless exempt from observing the second <i>Pesaḥ</i> is that part of the day is like the entire day, and the part of the day before they became impure, during which the blood of the Paschal offering was sprinkled for them, is considered a whole clean day.",
            "The Gemara responds to this attempted proof: <b>What</b> is the meaning of Rabbi Yosei’s statement that the ritual impurity applies <b>retroactively?</b> It means that the ritual impurity applies retroactively <b>by rabbinic law.</b> However, by Torah law, the <i>zav</i> or <i>zava</i> is impure only from the time of the new sighting and onward. The Gemara adds: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> that this is Rabbi Yosei’s opinion, <b>as, if it enters your mind</b> that they become ritually impure retroactively <b>by Torah law, why are they exempt from observing</b> the <b>second <i>Pesaḥ</i></b> if by Torah law they were impure at the time the offering was slaughtered?",

In a case where one brought his offering and later became aware that he had contracted impurity from a corpse, if this source of impurity was unknown to everyone, he is not required to observe the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>. The Gemara suggests that Rabbi Yosei may hold that the same <i>halakha</i> applies to the impurity of a <i>zava</i> as well: Since the owner of the offering was pure when it was brought and could not have known that she would become impure due to discharge later that day, it is similarly considered an impurity of the deep, and she has therefore fulfilled her obligation.",

            "According to this version of the dispute as well, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to Reish Lakish</b> from the mishna, which states: <b>One who took a vow of naziriteship while in a cemetery, even if he was there</b> for a full <b>thirty days</b> without leaving, those days he spent in the cemetery <b>do not count</b> as part <b>of his tally,</b> since his naziriteship has not yet gone into effect. <b>And he</b> therefore <b>does not bring the offerings of impurity,</b> despite having been in a cemetery. Rabbi Yoḥanan infers from this: <b>It is the offerings of impurity</b> that <b>he does not bring, but</b> he is <b>flogged for</b> contracting impurity, which is not in accordance with the opinion of Reish Lakish.",
            "The Gemara answers: This inference is not correct, as <b>by right</b> the mishna <b>should teach: He is not flogged, but due to</b> the fact that the <i>tanna</i> <b>wants to teach the latter clause</b> of the mishna, which states: If <b>he left</b> the cemetery <b>and entered</b> it again, those days <b>do count</b> as part <b>of his tally,</b> meaning the naziriteship takes effect, <b>and he does bring the offerings of impurity</b> for reentering the cemetery, the <i>tanna</i> therefore <b>taught</b> a similar phrasing in <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna: <b>He does not bring the offerings of impurity,</b> so this should not be seen as an indication that he is not flogged.",
            "The Gemara suggests another proof in support of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from another <i>baraita</i>: <b>The difference between an impure</b> person <b>who took a vow of naziriteship and a pure nazirite who became impure is only</b> the following <i>halakha</i>: <b>That</b> in the case of <b>an impure</b> person <b>who took a vow of naziriteship, his seventh</b> day of purification <b>counts</b> as part <b>of his tally</b> of the term of naziriteship. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>a pure nazirite who became impure, his seventh</b> day of purification <b>does not count</b> as part <b>of his tally.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>But with regard to flogging, this</b> nazirite <b>and that</b> nazirite <b>are equal.</b> Reish Lakish <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan: This is <b>not</b> a correct inference; rather, it is with regard <b>to shaving</b> on the seventh day of purification that <b>this</b> nazirite <b>and that</b> nazirite <b>are equal,</b> since even a ritually impure person who took a vow of naziriteship must shave on that day.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> in that case, according to Reish Lakish, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to flogging? This</b> nazirite <b>is flogged, and that</b> nazirite, who was ritually impure when he vowed, <b>is not flogged?</b> If so, <b>let him teach this</b> difference as well; why does the <i>baraita</i> state that there is only one difference between them? The Gemara answers: This <i>baraita</i> <b>is speaking of his remedy; it is not speaking of</b> a matter that is <b>detrimental to him.</b> Consequently the <i>baraita</i> does not discuss a nazirite’s punishments and discusses only the means by which he can resume his observance of naziriteship.",
            "The Gemara further suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from that which is taught in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:14): <b>One who was ritually impure and took a vow of naziriteship</b> must still observe the <i>halakhot</i> of a nazirite. He is <b>prohibited from shaving and from drinking wine. And if he shaved, or</b> if <b>he drank wine, or</b> if <b>he became ritually impure from a corpse, he incurs the forty</b> lashes administered to one who actively transgresses a negative Torah prohibition. The Gemara concludes: This is <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion of Reish Lakish, as explained by Mar bar Rav Ashi.",
            "§ After concluding that one who takes a vow of naziriteship while in a cemetery is liable to receive lashes, <b>Rava asks: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if one took a vow to be <b>a nazirite while</b> standing <b>in a cemetery:</b> Is it <b>necessary</b> that his exit from the cemetery be <b>delayed</b> for a specific period of time for him to become liable <b>to</b> receive <b>lashes,</b> just as one who becomes ritually impure while in the Temple receives lashes only if he remains there for a specific period of time, <b>or</b> is it <b>not</b> necessary?",
            "The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances</b> in which this question is relevant? <b>If we say that they said to him</b> in warning: <b>Do not take a vow of naziriteship</b> in the cemetery, and he ignored their warning and took a vow of naziriteship, <b>why do I</b> need him to <b>delay</b> his exit? <b>What is the reason</b> that one who was already <b>a nazirite</b> when he entered a cemetery <b>does not need to delay</b> his exit in order to be liable to receive lashes? <b>Because they warn him</b> not to enter, and if he enters he has transgressed a prohibition and is flogged. <b>Here too, they warn him</b> not to take the vow, and he should therefore be liable to receive lashes if he does take the vow."

        [
            "<b>Rather,</b> Rava’s question should be understood to refer to a case <b>where</b> one <b>entered</b> the cemetery <b>in a chest, box, or cabinet,</b> i.e., in large wooden containers that do not contract ritual impurity. One can enter a cemetery in such a container without becoming impure. If one was carried into a cemetery inside one of these containers, then took a vow of naziriteship, <b>and another came and removed the top [<i>ma’aziva</i>] from above him,</b> he would become ritually impure by virtue of being in the cemetery.",
            "If he was then warned to leave the cemetery, the question is as follows: <b>When we learned</b> by tradition that one is liable to receive lashes for <b>delaying</b> his exit, does that apply only <b>to the Temple, but outside</b> the Temple, such as when a nazirite is in a cemetery, does the <i>halakha</i> <b>not</b> apply, so that he is liable to receive lashes even if he did not delay his exit? <b>Or perhaps it is not different,</b> and a nazirite in a cemetery is flogged only if he remains there for a specific period of time. The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.",
            "§ <b>Rav Ashi raises a dilemma:</b> If <b>one took a vow of naziriteship while in a cemetery,</b> is he <b>required to shave</b> upon becoming ritually pure, before starting his term of naziriteship, <b>or not?</b> The Gemara explains the two sides of the question: <b>When</b> a ritually impure nazirite <b>is required to shave</b> before starting his tally, does that refer only to <b>a ritually pure</b> nazirite <b>who became impure, who has defiled his naziriteship? But a ritually impure</b> person <b>who</b> only <b>took a vow of naziriteship,</b> and whose naziriteship has not yet begun, is he <b>not</b> obligated to shave? <b>Or perhaps it is not different.</b>",

            "The Gemara questions this answer: <b>But what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>shaving?</b> Does <b>this</b> one, who became ritually impure, <b>shave, and that</b> one, who vowed while in a cemetery, <b>not shave?</b> If so, <b>let him teach this</b> difference as well. The Gemara answers: The <i>tanna</i> <b>taught: His seventh day, and all matters</b> relevant to it, including the <i>halakha</i> of shaving.

            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>No, if you say</b> so <b>with regard to his days of ritual impurity,</b> in that case it is <b>because with them, the previous</b> days of his naziriteship observed in ritual purity <b>are negated. Therefore,</b> those days <b>do not count</b> as part <b>of his tally.</b> But will <b>you say</b> the same <b>with regard to his days of confirmed</b> leprosy, <b>which do not negate the previous</b> days? If thirty days, enough time for his hair to regrow, remain in his term of naziriteship after becoming purified from his leprosy, the days before he contracted leprosy are not negated. It is <b>therefore</b> possible to argue that <b>they do count</b> as part <b>of his tally.</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: But <b>you can say</b> that <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>a nazirite</b> who was <b>in the grave,</b> i.e., a cemetery, <b>whose hair is fit for shaving,</b> those days spent in the cemetery <b>do not count</b> as part <b>of his tally, his days of confirmed</b> leprosy, <b>which are not fit for</b> counting as part of the tally required for the <b>shaving,</b> since he must first shave as part of the purification process for his leprosy, is it <b>not all the more so that they do not count</b> as part <b>of his tally?</b> This concludes the <i>baraita</i>.",
            "The Gemara now attempts to prove from the <i>baraita</i> that one who took a vow of naziriteship while in a cemetery must shave at the close of his process of purification: <b>What, is it not</b> so that when the <i>baraita</i> mentions shaving, it is referring to <b>the shaving of impurity,</b> and it is teaching that one who took a vow of naziriteship in a cemetery must shave at the end of his purification process? The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> it is referring to <b>the shaving of purity,</b> meaning the shaving done after one completes his term of naziriteship. He then will shave all of his hair, including that which grew during the time he was ritually impure due to his presence in the cemetery. The Gemara adds: <b>So, too, it is reasonable</b> to say that this is the correct interpretation,"

Rather, the <i>baraita</i> must be referring to the nazirite’s shaving of purity, as suggested above (17b). The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> it could be that the <i>baraita</i> is discussing the shaving done as a result of the nazirite’s impurity, and when it states that a leper is unfit for shaving, the <i>baraita</i> <b>is teaching</b> about the <b>shaving of naziriteship,</b> and the <i>baraita</i> is stating that a leper is unfit for any shaving of a nazirite, since he must first shave for his leprosy.",
            "The Gemara suggests another proof to answer the question of whether one who vows naziriteship while in a cemetery must shave upon undergoing purification. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And he defiles his consecrated head,</b> he shall shave his head on the day of his purification, on the seventh day shall he shave it” (Numbers 6:9).

And this verse comes <b>to exempt a nazirite</b> who vowed while <b>in the grave,</b> i.e., a cemetery, <b>that he does not require hair removal and the bringing of birds.</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues its analysis of this <i>halakha</i>. For one might have explained differently: <b>And are</b> these <b>matters,</b> the ruling that such a nazirite is exempt, <b>not</b> inferred with an <b><i>a fortiori</i> inference</b> to reach the opposite conclusion: <b>Just as a</b> nazirite who was <b>pure</b> from the outset and <b>who</b> subsequently <b>became impure requires hair removal and the bringing of birds,</b> if <b>one was impure from the outset,</b> as he took a vow of naziriteship while in a cemetery, <b>is it not logical that he should require hair removal and the bringing of birds?</b>",

The Gemara concludes: <b>Learn from this</b> that a nazirite who was ritually impure from the outset does not have to shave; this answers the question of Rav Ashi.",
            "§ After resolving the question, the Gemara discusses additional <i>halakhot</i> involving a ritually impure person who took a vow of naziriteship. <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>that the Sages taught</b> in the previous discussion: <b>The difference between an impure</b> person <b>who took a vow of naziriteship and a pure nazirite who became ritually impure is only</b> the following <i>halakha</i>: <b>That</b> with regard to <b>an impure</b> person <b>who took a vow of naziriteship, his seventh</b> day of purification <b>counts</b> as part <b>of his tally</b> of the term of naziriteship. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a pure nazirite who became impure, his seventh</b> day of purification <b>does not count</b> as part <b>of his tally.</b>",

This means that he renews the sanctity of his hair growth, i.e., begins observing his naziriteship in purity, <b>on the day of the bringing of his offerings,</b> the eighth day of his purification. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says:</b> This means that he renews the sanctity of his hair growth <b>on the day of his shaving,</b> the seventh day of his purification.",
            "§ The Gemara cites a related <i>halakha</i>: <b>And that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Karetot</i> 9a): If <b>a nazirite became impure</b> by contracting <b>many</b> consecutive <b>impurities, he brings only one</b> set of <b>offerings. Who taught</b> that? <b>Rav Ḥisda said: It is Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, who said</b> the <b>naziriteship of purity takes effect from the seventh</b> day of his purification process. <b>And you find this,</b> that he contracts ritual impurity several times consecutively, in a case <b>where he became ritually impure on the seventh</b> day <b>and,</b> after undergoing the purification process, <b>again became ritually impure on the seventh</b> day. <b>And whose</b> opinion is it? <b>It is</b> that of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda. Since</b> the <b>appropriate time to bring an offering had not</b> yet <b>arrived,</b> as all agree that his offerings are only brought on the eighth day, if he became ritually impure a second time <b>he is obligated</b> to <b>bring only one</b> set of <b>offerings.</b>",
            "<b>For if you say it</b> follows the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, how can this mishna be explained? <b>If</b> it deals with a nazirite <b>who became ritually impure on the seventh</b> day, <b>and,</b> after undergoing the purification process, <b>again became ritually impure on the seventh</b> day, <b>and,</b> after undergoing the purification process, <b>again became ritually impure on the seventh</b> day, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi would hold that <b>all these</b> impurities <b>are</b> in fact one <b>long ritual impurity,</b> because he never reached the eighth day, which would renew his observance of naziriteship in ritual purity, so the mishna would not refer to this as a case of multiple impurities. <b>And if</b> the mishna is referring to a nazirite <b>who became ritually impure on the eighth</b> day <b>and,</b> after undergoing the purification process, <b>again became ritually impure on the eighth</b> day, the <b>appropriate time to bring an offering had</b> already <b>arrived,</b> and if he becomes ritually impure at that stage, it is not viewed as a continuation of the previous ritual impurity, and he is obligated to bring another set of offerings.",
            "The Gemara clarifies the dispute between Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda: <b>What is the reason for Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s ruling that he begins counting only from the eighth day? The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states:</b> “And the priest shall prepare one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, <b>and make atonement for him, for he sinned by the soul”</b> (Numbers 6:11), <b>and</b> the same verse <b>again</b> states immediately afterward: <b>“And he shall sanctify his head.”</b> This shows that the naziriteship of purity commences only after he has brought his offerings. <b>And Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> says in response: <b>If so,</b> if the verse intended to teach us that his naziriteship starts only on the eighth day, <b>let the verse</b> merely <b>state: “And he shall sanctify his head,”</b> since that phrase addresses the bringing of his offerings, which is on the eighth."

The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>also, isn’t it written “on that day”?</b> What <i>halakha</i> does he derive from these additional words? The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi could have <b>said to you: That</b> verse <b>comes for this</b> purpose, <b>to tell you</b> that <b>even though he did not</b> yet <b>bring his offerings,</b> he starts counting his naziriteship of purity from the eighth day.

Therefore, this case will be one of a nazirite contracting ritual impurity many times.

            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Since he did not establish it in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi in this way, <b>shall we say that</b> Rav Ḥisda <b>holds</b> that <b>night is not</b> considered <b>premature?</b> In other words, although he cannot in practice bring his offerings until the morning, as the Temple service was performed only in the daytime, the night is not considered a premature time, but rather it is viewed as part of the day in which it is appropriate to bring his offerings. Consequently, the <i>halakha</i> of one who becomes ritually impure on the night preceding the eighth day is the same as that of one who contracted ritual impurity on the eighth day itself, and they are both required to bring an additional set of offerings.",

And if you say night is not</b> considered <b>premature,</b> and he is already obligated in his offerings at night, in that case <b>naziriteship of purity takes effect from the evening,</b> which means that the ritual impurity he suffered at night renders him obligated to bring an additional set of offerings. Consequently, the mishna does not follow the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, whether night is considered premature or not, and nothing can be inferred from here with regard to Rav Ḥisda’s opinion in that matter.",

            "<b>But</b> according to <b>Rabbi Yishmael, why do I</b> need the phrase “on <b>that</b> day”? According to his opinion the issue depends on the offerings, not the day. The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yishmael could have <b>said to you:</b> The phrase “on <b>that</b> day” teaches that he can begin counting <b>even though he has not brought his burnt-offering,</b> as he agrees that not bringing the burnt-offering does not preclude him from counting his naziriteship. <b>And the Rabbis</b> respond to this: <b>A burnt-offering does not require a limitation</b> in the text to teach that its omission does not preclude the start of his naziriteship in ritual purity, since <b>it is merely a gift</b> and not part of his atonement process.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason of the Rabbis</b> for ruling that only refraining from bringing his sin-offering precludes the start of his new count of naziriteship? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to a nazirite who became ritually impure: <b>“And he shall consecrate to the Lord the days of his naziriteship, and he shall bring a lamb in its first year for a guilt-offering”</b> (Numbers 6:12). <b>What does this teach?</b> Doesn’t he wait to begin the days of his naziriteship until after he has brought all of his offerings?

            "The Gemara poses a question: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught this that the Sages taught:</b> With regard to <b>a woman who vowed to be a nazirite and became ritually impure,</b> leading her to designate a bird for a sin-offering, a bird for a burnt-offering, and a sheep for a guilt-offering, <b>and afterward her husband nullified</b> her vow of naziriteship <b>for her, she brings the bird sin-offering and she does not bring the bird burnt-offering?</b>",
            "<b>Rav Ḥisda said: It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka. According to the opinion of the Rabbis, the burnt-offering is a gift, and she would bring it despite the fact that her naziriteship was nullified. According to Rabbi Yishmael, the burnt-offering is part of the atonement process, and since her naziriteship was nullified, there is no longer a need for atonement.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What does he hold? If he holds</b> that the <b>husband uproots</b> a vow entirely when he nullifies it, and she is considered not to have vowed at all, <b>she should not bring the bird sin-offering,</b> as she was never a nazirite, and she does not need atonement. Conversely, <b>if he holds</b> that the <b>husband severs</b> the vow from that point onward, but it did take effect beforehand, <b>she should also bring the bird burnt-offering,</b> as she requires atonement for becoming impure while she was a nazirite. The Gemara answers: <b>Actually, he holds</b> that the <b>husband uproots</b> the vow, <b>and</b> why is she obliged to bring a sin-offering? <b>Rabbi Yishmael holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar HaKappar.</b>",
            "<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Elazar HaKappar, the esteemed one, says: What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> with regard to a nazirite: <b>“And make atonement for him, for he sinned by the soul”</b> (Numbers 6:11)? <b>And with which soul did this</b> person <b>sin</b> by becoming a nazirite? <b>Rather,</b> in <b>afflicting himself</b> by abstaining <b>from wine,</b> he is considered to have sinned with his own soul, and he must bring a sin-offering for the naziriteship itself, for causing his body to suffer. <b>And an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference can be learned from this: <b>Just as this</b> person, in <b>afflicting himself</b> by abstaining <b>only from wine, is</b> nevertheless <b>called a sinner,</b> in the case of <b>one who afflicts himself</b> by abstaining <b>from everything,</b> through fasting or other acts of mortification, <b>all the more so</b> is he described as a sinner. According to this opinion, Rabbi Yishmael holds that since the woman afflicted herself by abstaining from wine she must bring a sin-offering, even though, due to her husband’s nullification, she did not actually become a nazirite.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty with Rabbi Elazar HaKappar’s dictum: <b>But this</b> verse, labeling the nazirite a sinner, <b>is written with regard to an impure nazirite, and we are saying</b> that <b>even a pure nazirite</b> is a sinner. The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Elazar HaKappar holds</b> that <b>a pure nazirite is also a sinner. And this is the reason that</b> the statement that a nazirite is a sinner <b>is written</b> in reference <b>to an impure nazirite</b> rather than a pure one: <b>Since he repeated his sin,</b> as his impurity causes him to start his naziriteship again, he thereby deprives himself for a longer period. He should have taken extra care to prevent this from happening.",
            "§ The mishna taught that if one took a vow of naziriteship while in a cemetery, <b>left</b> the cemetery, <b>and</b> then <b>entered</b> it again, the days he spent outside <b>do count</b> as part <b>of his tally</b> of his term of naziriteship, and he is obligated to bring the offerings of ritual impurity upon reentering the cemetery. The mishna <b>teaches: They do count</b> as part <b>of his tally.</b> The Gemara questions the meaning of this linkage: <b>Does naziriteship take effect for him because he</b> merely <b>left</b> the ritually impure place? He is still ritually impure, and he cannot begin counting his term of naziriteship until after he has undergone the purification process. <b>Shmuel said:</b> The mishna is referring to a case <b>where he left and</b> received the <b>sprinkling</b> of the ashes of the red heifer on the third day, <b>and</b> he <b>again</b> received the sprinkling on the seventh day <b>and immersed,</b> after which he entered the cemetery a second time. Since he is now ritually pure, his naziriteship takes effect.",
            "The Gemara poses another question: According to the precise reading of the mishna, his term of naziriteship starts only if he reentered the cemetery; <b>however,</b> is it only if he returned and <b>entered</b> the cemetery that those days <b>count</b> as part <b>of his tally,</b> but if he did <b>not enter,</b> and remained outside the cemetery, those days <b>do not count</b> as part <b>of his tally?</b> Why should the start of the naziriteship be dependent upon his reentering the cemetery? The Gemara answers: The <i>tanna</i> <b>is speaking</b> utilizing the style of: <b>It is not necessary,</b> as follows: <b>It is not necessary</b> to state this <i>halakha</i>, that those days count as part of his tally, in the case of one who <b>left</b> the cemetery and began his naziriteship, <b>but even if he entered</b> the cemetery again immediately after his purification, those days <b>count</b> as part <b>of his tally,</b> and he will be obligated to bring the offerings of ritual impurity upon his reentry.",
            "<b>Rav Kahana and Rav Asi said to Rav: What is the reason you did not explain</b> it <b>to us with these words</b> of Shmuel, as explained above? <b>He said to them: I said</b> to myself that <b>perhaps you do not require that</b> explanation, as I thought it was apparent that this is the proper explanation of the mishna.",
            "§ The mishna also taught an additional <i>halakha</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> This <i>halakha</i> does <b>not</b> apply to one who entered the cemetery <b>on that very day</b> that he left it, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of an impure nazirite: <b>“But the first days shall be void”</b> (Numbers 6:12), which indicates that he does not bring the offerings <b>unless he had</b> his <b>“first days”</b> of ritual purity, during which he observed his naziriteship. <b>Ulla said: Rabbi Eliezer said</b> this <i>halakha</i>, that one day of naziriteship in purity is not sufficient to obligate him to bring offerings if he becomes impure, <b>only with regard to an impure</b> person <b>who took a vow of naziriteship, but a pure nazirite who became impure, even</b> if he was only pure for <b>one day</b> of naziriteship, <b>it negates</b> that day of his tally and he must bring the offerings of an impure nazirite."

            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the mishna: If the vow of <b>the first</b> individual <b>was dissolved, they are all dissolved.</b> This indicates that <b>it is</b> only if the <b>first</b> one was <b>dissolved</b> that they are all considered dissolved. <b>However,</b> if the vow of the <b>middle</b> person was dissolved, <b>no,</b> the vows of the individuals following him are not considered dissolved. <b>Learn from this</b> that they all <b>associated</b> themselves <b>with</b> the vow of <b>the first</b> one.",

Is this a vow or not?",
            "The Gemara explains the two sides of the dilemma: <b>When a person associates</b> himself with a prohibition by means of another object, does he <b>associate</b> himself with it <b>by its fundamental state?</b> In this case, this would mean that he has associated himself with an article from which it is prohibited to benefit, as the flesh of a peace-offering is forbidden before its blood is sprinkled. Consequently, the vow would take effect. <b>Or perhaps</b> one <b>associates</b> himself with the item <b>by its</b> eventual <b>permitted state</b> [<b><i>bitzenana</i></b>], and as the flesh of a peace-offering may be eaten after the sprinkling of its blood, the vow is ineffective. This question is apparently analogous to the issue of the second woman’s vow: Is she referring to the fundamental, initial state of the first vow, before its nullification, or to its later, permitted state, after it has been dissolved?",
            "The Gemara refutes this argument: <b>Are</b> the two cases <b>comparable?

In their opinion, the dilemma concerning two women who vowed <b>is certainly</b> similar to that <b>of Rami bar Ḥama.</b>",

            "Rabbi Yoḥanan explains: <b>“And Lot lifted up</b> his eyes” employs the same expression as a verse that refers to Joseph’s temptation: <b>“That his master’s wife lifted up her eyes”</b> (Genesis 39:7), which is clearly referring to sin. The phrase used in reference to Lot, <b>“his eyes,”</b> is stated similarly to Samson’s appraisal of the Philistine girl he sought to marry: <b>“For she is pleasing in my eyes”</b> (Judges 14:3).",
            "Rabbi Yoḥanan continues to interpret the verse as a series of references to licentiousness. The phrase <b>“and saw”</b> is reminiscent of the verse dealing with Jacob’s daughter Dinah: <b>“And Shechem, the son of Hamor the Hivite, saw her</b> and he took her, and lay with her” (Genesis 34:2). The verse continues: <b>“All the plain [<i>kikar</i>] of the Jordan,”</b> which alludes to the verse: <b>“For on account of a harlot a man is brought to a loaf [<i>kikar</i>] of bread”</b> (Proverbs 6:26). The last part of the verse: <b>“That it was well watered everywhere,”</b> recalls: <b>“I will go after my lovers, who give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink”</b> (Hosea 2:7).",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> Lot <b>was forced</b> to participate in the sexual intercourse, as he was asleep at the time; how can he be considered a sinner? The Gemara answers that this is as a Sage <b>taught in the name of Rabbi Yosei bar Rav Ḥoni: Why is there a dot</b> in a Torah scroll <b>over</b> the letter <b><i>vav</i> of</b> the word <b>“<i>uvekumah</i>,” with regard to</b> Lot’s <b>elder</b> daughter, in the verse: “And he did not know when she lay down and when she arose [<i>uvekumah</i>]” (Genesis 19:33)? This dot serves <b>to say that when she lay down he did not know; however, when she arose he knew</b> what she had done, as he later understood what had happened.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And what could he have done</b> about it? <b>What has happened has happened;</b> i.e., Lot could not change the past. The Gemara answers: The <b>difference</b> is <b>that on the other,</b> following, <b>night, he should not have drunk wine</b> again. By allowing himself to get drunk a second time, he showed that the end result, engaging in sexual intercourse with his younger daughter, was something he desired.",

        ],
        [
            "<b>and their contentions are like the bars of a castle”</b> (Proverbs 18:19)? <b>“A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city,” this is Lot,</b> called Abraham’s brother (see Genesis 14:14), <b>who separated from Abraham. “And their contentions are like the bars of a castle,”</b> this is <b>because</b> Lot <b>brought contention</b> between the Jewish people and his own descendants <b>like bars,</b> which lock the gates of <b>a castle.</b> Just as no one can enter a locked castle, so too Lot’s descendants, Ammon and Moab, were prevented from joining the Jewish people, as it states: <b>“An Ammonite and a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of the Lord”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:4).",
            "On the same issue, <b>Rava expounded</b> a verse <b>homiletically, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “He who separates himself seeks his own desire, and snarls against all sound wisdom”</b> (Proverbs 18:1)? <b>“He who separates himself seeks his own desire,” this is Lot,</b> who separated from Abraham. <b>“And snarls [<i>yitgala</i>] against all sound wisdom,”</b> this too describes Lot, <b>as his shame was</b> eventually <b>revealed [<i>nitgala</i>] in the synagogues,</b> when his actions recorded in the Torah are read in public, <b>and in the study halls,</b> where the <i>halakhot</i> of his descendants are taught. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>An Ammonite and a Moabite are prohibited</b> from entering the congregation by marrying a Jewish woman, <b>and their prohibition is permanent.</b>",
            "§ In relation to the preceding discussion with regard to the daughters of Lot, who acted in a wanton manner for the sake of a mitzva, the Gemara cites that which <b>Ulla said: Tamar engaged in licentious</b> sexual intercourse with her father-in-law, Judah (see Genesis, chapter 38), and <b>Zimri</b> ben Salu also <b>engaged in licentious</b> sexual intercourse with a Midianite woman (see Numbers, chapter 25).",
            "Yet despite the similarity between their actions, <b>Tamar engaged in licentious</b> sexual intercourse for the sake of a mitzva, to have children, and therefore she merited that <b>kings</b> of the House of David <b>descended from her.</b> King David’s lineage traces back to Tamar’s son Peretz (see Ruth 4:18–22). <b>And</b> she also merited to be the ancestor of <b>prophets,</b> e.g., Isaiah, who was related to the royal family. Conversely, with regard to <b>Zimri,</b> who <b>engaged in licentious</b> sexual intercourse for the purpose of a transgression, <b>several multitudes of Israel fell due to him;</b> twenty-four thousand in a plague (see Numbers 25:9). This shows that a great deal depends on one’s intentions.",
            "§ <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Greater is a transgression</b> committed <b>for its own sake,</b> i.e., for the sake of Heaven, <b>than a mitzva</b> performed <b>not for its own sake.</b> The Gemara questions this comparison: <b>But didn’t Rav Yehuda say</b> that <b>Rav said: A person should always occupy himself with Torah and mitzvot even not for their own sake, as</b> it is <b>through</b> acts performed <b>not for their own sake</b> that good deeds <b>for their own sake come</b> about? How, then, can any transgression be considered greater than a mitzva not for the sake of Heaven?",
            "<b>Rather,</b> one must emend the above statement and <b>say</b> as follows: A transgression for the sake of Heaven is <b>equivalent to a mitzva not for its own sake.</b> The proof is <b>as it is written: “Blessed above women shall Yael be, the wife of Hever the Kenite, above women in the tent she shall be blessed”</b> (Judges 5:24), and it is taught: <b>Who are</b> these <b>“women in the tent?”</b> They are <b>Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah.</b> Yael’s forbidden intercourse with Sisera for the sake of Heaven is compared to the sexual intercourse in which the Matriarchs engaged.",
            "The Gemara asks: How is it derived that Yael engaged in sexual intercourse with Sisera? As <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: That wicked one,</b> Sisera, <b>engaged in seven acts of sexual intercourse</b> with Yael <b>at that time, as it is stated: “Between her feet he sunk, he fell, he lay;</b> between her feet he sunk, he fell; where he sunk, there he fell down dead” (Judges 5:27). Each mention of falling is referring to another act of intercourse.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> Yael at least <b>enjoyed the sexual intercourse</b> with <b>him;</b> why is the verse so effusive in her praise? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: All the good of the wicked,</b> i.e., anything good received from wicked people, <b>is nothing other</b> than <b>evil for the righteous,</b> and therefore she certainly derived no pleasure from the act.",
            "The Gemara asks: From where is this principle derived? <b>As</b> it <b>is stated</b> in the verse that God warned Laban the Aramean, when he was chasing Jacob: <b>“Guard yourself from speaking to Jacob, from good to evil”</b> (Genesis 31:24). <b>Granted,</b> with regard to the warning against speaking <b>evil,</b> it is <b>fine</b> that Laban was warned not to harm Jacob. <b>However, why shouldn’t</b> he say anything <b>good</b> to Jacob? <b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> this verse that even Laban’s <b>good is bad</b> in Jacob’s eyes? The Gemara concludes: <b>Learn from this</b> that it is so.",
            "§ The Gemara returns to analyze in greater detail <b>the</b> above matter <b>itself. Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: A person should always occupy himself with Torah and mitzvot even not for their own sake, as through</b> these acts performed <b>not for their own sake,</b> good deeds <b>for their own sake come</b> about. The proof for this is <b>that in reward for the forty-two offerings that the wicked Balak sacrificed</b> (see Numbers, chapter 23), although he did not do so for the sake of Heaven but to facilitate the cursing of the Jewish people, nevertheless <b>he merited that Ruth descended from him.</b> Not only was he the forebear of a righteous convert, but also of King David. <b>And</b> this is as <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: Ruth was the daughter of the son of Eglon, king of Moab,</b> who descended from Balak, king of Moab.",

Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Only”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:26). The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>a verse</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? After all, <b>this <i>halakha</i> is learned</b> as a tradition that <b>the offspring of a sin-offering goes to</b> its <b>death.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>So too,</b> this is correct as far as the offspring of a sin-offering is concerned, <b>and the verse comes</b> to teach that this <i>halakha</i> applies <b>to a guilt-offering</b> as well.",
            "The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>a guilt-offering as well, this <i>halakha</i> is learned</b> as a tradition: <b>Any</b> situation <b>that if it were</b> to occur <b>with a sin-offering</b> it would be left to <b>die,</b> i.e., any offering that is invalid in such a manner that it would have to be left to die if it were a sin-offering, which includes a substitute, if <b>it</b> occurs <b>with a guilt-offering it</b> is left to <b>graze</b> until it develops a blemish so that it is no longer fit for the altar. Why, then, is a verse required to teach this <i>halakha</i>?",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the argument is as follows: <b>If</b> one would have learned this ruling only <b>from the</b> aforementioned <b><i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai, <b>I would say:</b> It is admittedly <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> that the offspring of a sin-offering must die and the substitute of a guilt-offering is left to graze, <b>but if he sacrificed it</b> regardless, <b>he would not be liable to</b> receive <b>any</b> punishment <b>for it. The verse</b> therefore <b>teaches us that if he sacrifices</b> the offspring or substitute of a guilt-offering, <b>he transgresses a positive mitzva by it,</b> as derived from the verse: “Only your sacred things which you have, and your vows, you shall take and go to the place which the Lord shall choose” (Deuteronomy 12:26).",

            "The Gemara infers from Rav’s statement: <b>The reason</b> for this ruling is <b>that</b> it is a guilt-offering that was <b>consigned</b> to grazing, from which it may be inferred that <b>if</b> it were <b>not consigned</b> in this manner it is <b>not</b> valid as a burnt-offering.

            "The mishna continues: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that he can no longer nullify the vow, <b>said?</b> It is when she is bringing the offerings <b>for</b> her <b>shaving of ritual purity,</b> when she has completed her term of naziriteship without becoming ritually impure (see Numbers 6:18). <b>However,</b> if she is sacrificing the offerings <b>for</b> her <b>shaving of impurity,</b> when she became ritually impure during her term of naziriteship, after which she restarts her naziriteship (see Numbers 6:9), her husband <b>can nullify</b> her vow. The reason is <b>that he can say: I do not want a downcast [<i>menuvvelet</i>] wife,</b> who does not drink wine. She would have to refrain from wine for a lengthy period if she were to begin her naziriteship anew. <b>Rabbi Meir says: He can nullify</b> her vow <b>even</b> at the stage <b>of</b> her <b>shaving of purity,</b> after she has begun sacrificing her offerings, <b>as he can say: I do not want a shaven wife,</b> and a nazirite is obligated to shave after bringing his or her offerings.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna,</b> which rules that a husband cannot nullify his wife’s naziriteship after the blood of her offering has been sprinkled at the end of the naziriteship term, <b>is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer. As, if</b> it followed the ruling of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, didn’t he say</b> that <b>shaving is indispensable</b> for the end of a nazirite’s term, i.e., a nazirite at the end of his naziriteship is prohibited from drinking wine and becoming impure from the dead until he actually shaves? <b>And</b> in this case, <b>since she has not</b> yet <b>shaved, she</b> remains <b>prohibited from</b> drinking <b>wine. And since she becomes downcast</b> through her abstinence from wine, evidently the husband <b>can nullify</b> her vow even after the sprinkling of the blood of her offerings of purity."
        ],
        [
            "<b>The <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna <b>holds: Once</b> the <b>blood has been sprinkled on her behalf</b> she is <b>immediately permitted</b> to drink <b>wine, and</b> therefore <b>she is not downcast.</b> Consequently, the husband has no right to nullify her naziriteship vow at that point, as her vow does not affect him. <b>And Rabbi Akiva holds: Even</b> if the blood has yet to be sprinkled and wine remains forbidden to her, as soon as <b>an animal is slaughtered</b> for one of her offerings the husband <b>can no</b> longer <b>nullify</b> the vow, <b>due to the loss of consecrated</b> property. If he were to nullify her vow she would have no further need of the offerings, and it is prohibited to waste Sanctuary property.",
            "<b>Rabbi Zeira objects to this: And why</b> should the result be a loss to the Sanctuary? He can avoid this by <b>sprinkling their blood not for the sake</b> of the offerings of a nazirite, <b>and he will</b> thereby <b>permit the meat</b> of the offering to <b>be eaten,</b> and the consecrated animal will not go to waste. <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the communal peace-offering of two <b>sheep</b> that accompanies the two loaves on <b><i>Shavuot</i>, if one slaughtered them not for the sake</b> of that offering, <b>or slaughtered them before their time,</b> on the eve of the Festival, <b>or after their time,</b> after the Festival, <b>the blood shall be sprinkled,</b> although not for the sake of that offering, as it is no longer fit for that purpose, <b>and the meat is eaten.</b>",
            "<b>And if it was a Shabbat,</b> the blood <b>may not be sprinkled.</b> Since the meat cannot be eaten on that day, sprinkling the blood is considered a form of unnecessary labor on Shabbat. <b>And if he sprinkled</b> the blood on Shabbat anyway, the offering <b>is accepted,</b> and he must wait <b>to burn</b> its sacrificial <b>parts</b> on the altar <b>in the evening,</b> after the conclusion of Shabbat. In any case, this shows that it is permitted to sprinkle the blood of an offering not for its own sake <i>ab initio</i> so that its flesh can be eaten.",
            "The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>If he had slaughtered</b> only the woman’s naziriteship offerings of the <b>burnt-offering or</b> the <b>peace-offering, so too,</b> he may certainly proceed to sprinkle the blood not for the sake of that offering, to avoid the loss of a consecrated animal. In that case Rabbi Akiva would agree that the husband can still nullify her vow. <b>However, with what are we dealing here?</b> It is with a case <b>where he slaughtered the sin-offering first.</b> Since a sin-offering whose blood was sprinkled not for its sake is invalid, if the husband were to nullify her vow this would cause a loss of consecrated property.",
            "The Gemara cites the source that the order of a nazirite’s offerings may be changed and the sin-offering may be sacrificed first. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (45a): <b>If he shaved</b> after the sacrifice <b>of one of the three</b> nazirite offerings, either the burnt-offering, the peace-offering, or the sin-offering, <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation.",
            "§ The mishna taught: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that a husband cannot nullify his wife’s vow, <b>said?</b> It is <b>with regard to a shaving of ritual purity; however, with regard to a shaving of impurity</b> the husband can <b>nullify</b> it if he wishes. <b>And Rabbi Meir says: He may even nullify</b> the vow <b>at</b> her <b>shaving of purity because he can say: I do not want a shaven wife.</b>",
            "The Gemara analyzes these opinions: <b>And the first <i>tanna</i></b> could have <b>said to you</b> in response to Rabbi Meir’s argument: It is <b>possible</b> for her to compensate <b>by</b> wearing <b>a wig,</b> and therefore she would not appear shaven, and her husband would have no cause for complaint. <b>And Rabbi Meir holds:</b> As for compensating <b>by</b> wearing <b>a wig, since</b> it is <b>dirty he is not amenable</b> to this solution, and he may therefore nullify her vow.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A man can vow</b> that <b>his</b> minor <b>son should be a nazirite,</b> i.e., a father can declare his son a nazirite, <b>but a woman cannot vow</b> that <b>her son should be a nazirite. How so;</b> what are the details of this naziriteship? If the son <b>shaved</b> his hair, thereby demonstrating his rejection of the vow imposed by his father; <b>or</b> if <b>his relatives shaved him;</b> or if the son <b>objected</b> by saying that he has no desire for this naziriteship; <b>or if his relatives objected</b> on his behalf, the naziriteship is canceled.",
            "If this son who canceled the naziriteship <b>had animals separated</b> for his offerings, the one set aside for <b>the sin-offering must die, and the burnt-offering is sacrificed as a burnt-offering, and</b> the <b>peace-offering is sacrificed as a peace-offering. And</b> the peace-offering <b>is eaten for one day,</b> like the peace-offering of a nazirite, rather than the two days of a regular peace-offering, <b>and it does not require bread,</b> i.e., the loaves that accompany a nazirite’s peace-offering.",
            "If <b>he had unallocated funds,</b> they <b>will be allocated for</b> communal <b>gift</b> offerings. If he had <b>allocated funds</b> for his offerings, <b>the money for the sin-offering is taken</b> and cast <b>into the Dead Sea,</b> as one may <b>not benefit</b> from it <i>ab initio</i>, <b>but</b> if he benefits <b>from it,</b> he is <b>not</b> liable to bring an offering for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property.

            "The Gemara continues its question: <b>However, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> who said that <b>Reish Lakish said</b> that the reason the vow takes effect is to educate the son in mitzvot, in this case the priest <b>eats</b> an unslaughtered <b>animal carcass.</b> If the son is not obligated to bring the offering, the priest will be eating a bird that was killed in a manner that does not render it fit for consumption, which means it has the status of an unslaughtered carcass.",
            "The Gemara answers: Reish Lakish <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds <b>that slaughter of a bird is not</b> obligatory <b>by Torah law.</b> Rather, by Torah law birds are fit to be eaten no matter how they are killed, and it was the Sages who decreed that they must be slaughtered. <b>And</b> he also maintains that the prohibition against bringing <b>non-sacred</b> animals for slaughter <b>in the Temple courtyard</b> does <b>not</b> apply <b>by Torah law.</b> Consequently the rabbinic mitzva of education overrides these prohibitions, as they too are rabbinic.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Yosei hold this</b> opinion? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the bird sin-offering that comes due to uncertainty is not eaten? The verse states: “And they who have an issue, whether a male or a female”</b> (Leviticus 15:33), which <b>juxtaposes a female to a male: Just as a male brings an offering for a definite</b> sin, i.e., for a transgression he is sure he committed inadvertently, <b>so too, a female brings an offering for a definite</b> sin. <b>And just as a male brings</b> a provisional guilt-offering <b>for</b> his <b>uncertain</b> transgression, <b>so too, a female brings</b> an offering <b>for</b> her case of <b>uncertainty.</b>",

This leads to the following question: <b>If</b> so, one can continue this line of thought: <b>Just as a male brings an offering and</b> it <b>is eaten, so too, a female brings an offering and</b> it should be <b>eaten</b> when she sacrifices an offering for uncertain childbirth.

            "<b>No,</b> you cannot make this claim, because <b>if you say</b> that this is true <b>with regard to a male, when</b> bringing his offering involves only <b>one</b> uncertain <b>prohibition,</b> i.e., that he might be bringing non-sacred animals into the Temple courtyard, <b>shall you</b> also <b>say</b> that this is the case <b>with regard to a female, whose</b> case includes <b>two prohibitions?</b> This concludes the <i>baraita</i>.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> are these <b>two prohibitions?</b> Are they <b>not the prohibition</b> against consuming an unslaughtered <b>animal carcass</b> by eating a bird killed by pinching, <b>and</b> the prohibition against bringing <b>non-sacred</b> animals <b>into the</b> Temple <b>courtyard?</b> This shows that the prohibition against bringing non-sacred animals into the Temple courtyard applies by Torah law according to the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda. <b>Rav Aḥa, son</b> of <b>Rav Ika, objects to this: And perhaps</b> one is not liable for these prohibitions by Torah law, rather, the <i>baraita</i> means that one <b>is liable for this because it appears like two</b> Torah <b>prohibitions,</b> although they actually apply only <b>by rabbinic law.</b>",
            "§ The Gemara returns to the question of whether the ruling that a man can impose naziriteship on his son is a <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai or whether it is part of the boy’s education. <b>Let us say</b> that this is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b> As it is taught: <b>Until when can</b> a father <b>vow</b> that <b>his son</b> should <b>be a nazirite?</b> It is <b>until</b> the son <b>develops two</b> pubic <b>hairs;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says:</b> It is <b>until he reaches the age of vows,</b> usually approximately a year earlier, when he demonstrates an understanding of the nature of vows. If he vows at that age and comprehends the significance of his utterance, his vow is valid.",
            "<b>What, is it not</b> the case that this <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>: As Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds</b> that <b>it is a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai <b>with regard to a nazirite, and</b> therefore <b>even though</b> the son has already <b>reached the age of vows</b> and is capable of making his own decision with regard to the vow, this <i>halakha</i> states that the father <b>continues to vow for him until he develops two</b> pubic <b>hairs,</b> the sign of maturity. <b>And Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> that the father can vow for the son only <b>until he reaches the age of vows, holds</b> that he imposes a vow on his son <b>in order to educate him in mitzvot, and since</b> the son <b>has left</b> the father’s <b>supervision</b> to the degree that he can utter his own vows, the father <b>is no longer obligated</b> to educate him in this area of <i>halakha</i>.",
            "The Gemara rejects this argument. The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>No;</b> this is not the correct explanation of that dispute, as one can say <b>that everyone,</b> both Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, agrees with Rabbi Yoḥanan that <b>it is a <i>halakha</i> with regard to a nazirite, and here they disagree with regard to</b> the issue of <b>a minor one year before</b> he or she <b>reaches majority.</b> In other words, they dispute the case of a child who utters a vow when he is almost mature, on the verge of puberty. It is an accepted <i>halakha</i> that the vow of this child is valid if he understands its meaning. The dispute concerns the source of this <i>halakha</i>.",
            "<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds</b> that the status of <b>a minor one year before</b> he or she <b>reaches majority</b> applies <b>by rabbinic law, and</b> therefore the <i>halakha</i> <b>by Torah law</b> that a father can vow on behalf of his son <b>comes and overrides</b> the decree that one who is near the age of maturity is considered an independent adult with regard to vows, which is <b>by rabbinic law. And Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, holds</b> that the status of <b>a minor one year before</b> he or she <b>reaches majority</b> applies <b>by Torah law.</b> Consequently, the <i>halakha</i> that a father can vow on behalf of his son does not apply to this case.",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead <b>that everyone</b> agrees that a father vows for his son <b>in order to educate him in mitzvot,</b> which means it is by rabbinic law, <b>and</b> likewise the status of <b>a minor one year before</b> he or she <b>reaches majority is</b> also <b>by rabbinic law.</b> In that case, the <i>tanna’im</i> dispute the following: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds</b> that the mitzva of <b>education,</b> which applies <b>by rabbinic law, comes and overrides</b> the status of <b>a minor one year before</b> he or she <b>reaches majority,</b> which is also <b>by rabbinic law.</b>",

            "With regard to the dispute concerning the time period for a father’s vow on behalf of his son, the Gemara suggests: <b>Shall we say</b> that the dispute between <b>these <i>tanna’im</i> is like</b> the dispute between <b>those</b> other <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Nidda</i> 5:9): <b>An incident</b> occurred <b>involving Rabbi Ḥanina</b> in <b>which his father vowed</b> that he should <b>be a nazirite</b> when he was a minor, <b>and they brought him before Rabban Gamliel, and Rabban Gamliel examined him to discern if he had</b> already <b>developed two</b> pubic <b>hairs,</b> in which case the vow would not take effect, or <b>if he had not developed</b> them, which would mean that the vow was valid.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yosei says</b> that Rabban Gamliel examined him <b>to discern whether he had reached the age of vows or not,</b> which he maintains is the decisive factor.

Similarly, all other prohibitions in the Torah are more severe than the case of a nazirite in one of these aspects, and therefore this principle is universal.

Rav Ashi <b>said to him:</b> The Rabbis maintain that <b>there</b> the <i>halakha</i> of purging vessels of gentiles <b>is</b> also <b>a novelty.</b> What is the novelty of this <i>halakha</i>? <b>As</b> with regard <b>to all</b> dietary laws in the <b>Torah, anything that gives flavor,</b> i.e., contributes taste, that renders the food <b>tainted,</b> is <b>permitted.</b> If the taste added by the forbidden food does not enhance the permitted food, it does not render that food forbidden.",
            "<b>But</b> here, <b>with regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of vessels of <b>gentiles</b> that require <b>purging,</b> the Torah states that even if they contribute taste that renders the food tainted, nevertheless they are <b>forbidden.</b> If twenty-four hours have passed since food was cooked in a pot, the assumption is that the flavor released from the pot will contribute a deleterious taste to any foods subsequently cooked in the pot. Even so, vessels taken from gentiles remain forbidden until they have been purged, despite the fact that the taste they contribute taints the food.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva too,</b> the case of vessels of gentiles that require purging <b>is</b> apparently <b>a novelty.</b> Rabbi Akiva derives this principle from the required purging of the vessels of gentiles. How then does he respond to the previous claim? <b>Rav Huna, son of Ḥiyya, said: The Torah prohibited</b> the use of unpurged vessels of gentiles <b>only in</b> the case of <b>a pot</b> that was used <b>on that day, which is not</b> a case where the pot <b>gives flavor</b> that renders the food <b>tainted.</b> Accordingly, it is not a novelty that the vessels were forbidden.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why don’t <b>the Rabbis</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> from there, as it is no longer a novelty? The Gemara answers: They hold that <b>even</b> in the case of <b>a pot</b> used <b>on that day, it is impossible that</b> the vessel <b>does not slightly taint</b> the food absorbed in the vessel. Consequently, the <i>halakha</i> of purging vessels of gentiles is a novelty, from which general principles cannot be derived.",
            "§ <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Avya, said to Rav Ashi: From</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, we infer</b> the proper understanding of the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.

According to Rabbi Akiva as well, who establishes this</b> term: <b>“Soaked,” as</b> teaching that <b>the permitted</b> substance <b>combines with the forbidden</b> substance with regard to a nazirite, <b>let us say</b> that <b>from here you derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to all prohibitions of the Torah.</b> This explanation runs counter to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, who applies this principle only to a nazirite.",
            "Rav Ashi <b>said to him:</b> This cannot serve as a proof, <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a nazirite and</b> those of <b>a sin-offering</b> are from <b>two verses that come as one,</b> i.e., to teach the same matter, <b>and any two verses that come as one do not teach</b> their common aspect to apply to other cases. The Gemara comments: The derivation that a permitted substance joins together with a forbidden substance in the case of <b>a nazirite</b> is <b>that which we stated,</b> from the term “soaked.” With regard to <b>a sin-offering, what is</b> the derivation that a permitted substance combines with a forbidden substance?",
            "It is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse discussing a sin-offering <b>“Anything that touches in its flesh shall become consecrated”</b> (Leviticus 6:20). One <b>might</b> have thought that non-sacred meat that touched any part of a sin-offering is consecrated <b>even if it did not absorb</b> the taste of the sin-offering it touched. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “In its flesh,”</b> to teach that this meat is not consecrated <b>until</b> the taste of the sin-offering <b>is absorbed within its flesh.</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>“Shall become consecrated,”</b> means that its legal status <b>becomes like</b> that of the sin-offering itself; <b>that</b> is, <b>if</b> the sin-offering <b>is disqualified,</b> the non-sacred meat that touched it <b>will</b> also <b>be disqualified. And if</b> the sin-offering <b>is valid,</b> the non-sacred meat that touched it <b>may be eaten in accordance with the more stringent</b> standards <b>of</b> a sin-offering, with regard to when and where it may be eaten. The principle that a permitted substance combines with a forbidden substance is thereby stated in the case of a sin-offering as well. Consequently, the principle cannot be extended to the entire Torah, as a <i>halakha</i> stated in two cases is not applied elsewhere.",
            "<b>And the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Akiva, would maintain that both these sources <b>are necessary,</b> as neither the case of a nazirite nor the case of a sin-offering could be derived from the other. Therefore, this is not a case of two verses that come as one. The Gemara elaborates: <b>For had the Merciful One written</b> this <i>halakha</i> only <b>with regard to a sin-offering, I would say</b> that the case of <b>a nazirite cannot be derived from it, due to</b> the fact that <b>we do not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a nazirite from</b> that of <b>consecrated</b> items. This is because the prohibitions of naziriteship are unrelated to the Temple and offerings, and therefore it is possible that the <i>halakha</i> in question is unique to consecrated items.",

It is stringent <b>as even a grape seed is forbidden to</b> a nazirite, although the seeds are not usually eaten. <b>Therefore,</b> the <i>halakha</i> of a sin-offering <b>cannot be derived from</b> the case of a nazirite, which means that this is not a case of two verses that come as one. Consequently, one can derive a general <i>halakha</i> from them.",
            "<b>And Rabbi Akiva</b> could have <b>said to you,</b> in rebuttal of this claim: <b>Why are</b> these cases both <b>necessary? Granted, if the Merciful One had written</b> this principle only with regard <b>to a sin-offering,</b> one would <b>not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a nazirite from it,</b> as <b>we do not derive</b> <i>halakhot</i> of <b>non-sacred</b> items <b>from</b> those of <b>consecrated</b> items. Certain stringencies and strictures apply only to consecrated property. <b>However, let the Merciful One write</b> this principle <b>with regard to a nazirite, and you</b> could <b>derive</b> the case of the <b>sin-offering from</b> that of a nazirite, just <b>as</b> the application of this principle to <b>all prohibitions in the Torah is derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a nazirite.</b> Since it is not necessary to state this principle in both cases, one cannot derive a general principle from them.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis,</b> who maintain that the principle that the legal status of the flavor of a forbidden substance is like that of the substance itself is not limited to these two cases, <b>would say to you</b> that both sources are required.

The Gemara explains this dispute: <b>The first <i>tanna</i> does not liken all the</b> other <b>prohibitions of a nazirite to</b> the prohibition of <b>drinking</b> wine, and therefore the measurements for eating and drinking are the same as for prohibitions in other contexts: An olive-bulk of food and a quarter-<i>log</i> of drink. <b>And Rabbi Akiva</b> maintains that <b>since it is written: “Nor eat fresh grapes or dried”</b> (Numbers 6:3), this verse teaches that <b>just as eating</b> is measured by the amount of <b>an olive-bulk, so too, all the prohibitions</b> of a nazirite are measured by <b>an olive-bulk.</b>",

            "§ The Gemara returns to the mishna that teaches that nazirites, lepers, and Levites must shave their hair. <b>The Master said</b> above: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all of them, if they shaved with</b> an implement <b>other than a razor, or if they left two hairs</b> uncut, <b>they have done nothing.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> do we learn this?

This shows that <b>in general the majority of</b> an entity is <b>like all of it.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, objects to this</b> assertion. <b>This</b> verse: “On the seventh day he shall shave it,” <b>is written with regard to a ritually impure nazirite,</b> not a pure one, whereas the <i>halakha</i> in the mishna applies even to a pure nazirite.

The verses speak of the camps of the Jewish people in the wilderness, and the Sages taught that the statuses of certain areas of Jerusalem corresponded to those camps. The camps in the wilderness were the Israelite camp, the Levite camp, and the camp of the Divine Presence. They correspond to Jerusalem, the Temple Mount, and the Temple itself.

            "§ The mishna taught that one of the sources of ritual impurity for which a nazirite must shave is a full ladle of dust from a corpse. <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Oholot</i> 2:3): <b>Which is a corpse that has</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>dust,</b> i.e., whose dust imparts impurity? <b>A corpse that was buried naked in a marble coffin or on a stone floor; this is a corpse that has</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>dust</b> that imparts impurity. Any dust found there must have come from the corpse. However, if it was <b>buried in its cloak,</b> or <b>in a wooden coffin, or on a brick floor, this is a corpse that does not have</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>dust</b> that imparts impurity. In the latter cases it is assumed that the dust from the corpse includes particles from the clothes, wood, or bricks that disintegrated, and there is a tradition that the impurity of dust applies only to dust that comes solely from the corpse, not to a mixture from different sources.",
            "With regard to the same issue, <b>Ulla said: Dust is only that which comes from the flesh and from the sinews and from the bones</b> of the corpse together, but not if it came from one of these alone. <b>Rava raised an objection to Ulla</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Dust that comes from the flesh is pure.</b> It can be inferred from here that if it comes <b>from the bone it is impure, even though there is no</b> dust of <b>flesh</b> mixed with it. Ulla replied: You <b>should say</b> and infer <b>like this: Dust that comes from the flesh is pure, unless there is bone in the flesh.</b>",
            "Rava continued to question Ulla’s opinion: Even if one interprets the <i>baraita</i> in this manner, <b>there is no</b> mention of <b>sinews</b> here at all, and Ulla maintains that sinews must also contribute to the makeup of part of the dust. Ulla replied that there is no need to mention sinews explicitly, as <b>it is impossible for</b> there to be <b>flesh and bones without sinews.</b> Once it is established that the dust is from bones and flesh, it necessarily includes sinews as well.",
            "§ The Gemara continues to discuss the dust of a corpse. <b>Rav Shmuel bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Two corpses that were buried with one another become a mixture [<i>galgallin</i>] with one another.</b> Their dust is considered mixed together and does not impart the impurity of the dust from a single corpse. <b>Rav Natan raises an objection</b> to this opinion: But it is taught that <b>dust that comes from two corpses is impure.</b>",

However, if the corpses decayed together they are considered to be mixed together, which means that their dust does not impart impurity.",
            "The Gemara cites a further statement with regard to dust of a corpse. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> If one <b>cut the hair</b> of a corpse <b>and buried</b> the hair <b>with it,</b> the hair <b>becomes</b> part of the <b>mixture for</b> the dust, and it does not impart impurity.

Consequently, he counts another period of thirty days for his naziriteship of purity, at the end of which he may perform the shaving of purity, drink wine, and become impure from a corpse, 120 days from the start of his naziriteship.",
            "<b>And it is taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (6:1) <b>with regard to</b> that mishna: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said? With regard to a short naziriteship</b> of thirty days. <b>However, with regard to a naziriteship of a year, he eats sacrificial food after two years.</b> He cannot shave until a year has passed, in case he is not a leper, and he may shave the second time only after a second year, in case he was ritually impure, and this was his naziriteship observed in purity. After two years, he may eat sacrificial meat, for if he was a full-fledged leper he has shaved twice.",
            "However, if the first two shavings were for his leprosy, he has not shaved for his naziriteship at all, and therefore he must observe an additional year, shave, and observe another year of naziriteship, as perhaps his third shaving was for impurity and the other for his naziriteship in purity. <b>And</b> consequently, <b>he may drink wine and become impure to</b> bury <b>a corpse after four years.</b>",
            "<b>And if it enters your mind</b> that the <b>days</b> during which he was ritually impure <b>count toward his</b> naziriteship, <b>it should be enough for him to</b> observe <b>three years and thirty days.</b> Due to uncertainty, he cannot shave for his leprosy until a year has passed, in case he was a pure nazirite, and he must wait another year for his second shaving, as he might have been an impure nazirite. However, at that point, if the days of his counting are considered part of his naziriteship, as claimed by Rav Ḥisda, he should be allowed to wait a mere thirty days for hair growth, shave for his impure naziriteship, and then add a final year for his naziriteship in purity. The fact that he is obligated to wait four years proves that his time as a leper does not count toward his naziriteship.",

However,</b> he <b>cannot</b> force his slave in the case <b>of</b> other <b>vows and valuations.</b> This <i>baraita</i> is apparently saying that a master cannot prevent his slave from fulfilling the terms of a vow.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is different with regard to a nazirite</b> that a master can force his slave to transgress his naziriteship, <b>as the Merciful One states: “To bind his soul with a bond”</b> (Numbers 30:3), from which it is inferred that the Torah is referring only <b>to one whose soul is in his possession,</b> i.e., who is not owned by another; this <b>excludes a slave, whose soul is not in his possession</b> because he is under his master’s control. <b>If so,</b> then <b>even with regard to vows</b> that same <i>halakha</i> should apply <b>as well,</b> as that verse is written in the context of vows in general, not specifically vows of naziriteship. Why is a master unable to compel his slave to break a vow?",
            "<b>Rav Sheshet said: With what are we dealing here?</b> With a case <b>where a cluster of grapes was placed before</b> the slave and he vowed not to derive benefit from it. <b>With regard to vows, when</b> he <b>is prohibited from</b> eating <b>this</b> cluster he <b>is not rendered prohibited from</b> eating <b>others;</b> therefore, the master <b>cannot force him</b> to eat it, as he has no reason to insist that the slave consume this particular cluster of grapes.",
            "By contrast, <b>with regard to naziriteship, when</b> he <b>is prohibited from</b> eating <b>this</b> cluster he <b>is rendered prohibited from</b> consuming <b>all others;</b> therefore, the master <b>can force him</b> to eat. This is because the lack of food weakens the slave, who is the property of his master. The Gemara asks: <b>And with regard to vows, are we not dealing</b> even with a situation <b>where he has only this cluster</b> before him and he vows not to eat it, in <b>which</b> case <b>if he does not eat it he is weakened?</b> Why can’t the master compel him to eat the grapes in this case?",
            "<b>Rather, Rava said</b> that the difference between vows of naziriteship and other vows concerns a case <b>where there was a grape seed,</b> which provides only negligible nourishment, that was <b>placed before</b> the slave, and he vowed not to eat it. <b>With regard to vows,</b> concerning <b>which he is prohibited to</b> eat only <b>this</b> one seed, the master <b>cannot force him</b> to eat it, as refraining from eating a grape seed would not weaken him. <b>With regard to a nazirite, who is prohibited from</b> consuming <b>other</b> grape products <b>as well,</b> the master <b>can force him.</b>",
            "The Gemara again asks: <b>And with regard to vows, are we not dealing</b> even with a situation <b>where he has only this grape seed</b> in front of him, in <b>which</b> case <b>if he does not eat it he would be weakened?</b> Why, then, can the master compel him to violate only his naziriteship vow but not a regular vow?",
            "<b>Rather, Abaye said</b> that the <i>baraita</i> does not in fact list cases in which a master can compel his slave to violate his vow, but rather means the following: <b>With regard to what</b> situation <b>is a master</b> who wants to negate his slave’s vow <b>required to force</b> his slave to violate his vow by stating explicitly that he does not want him to fulfill it? It is the case <b>of</b> a vow of <b>naziriteship.

            "<b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is <b>as the verse states</b> with regard to oaths: “Or if anyone swear clearly with his lips <b>to do evil, or to do good”</b> (Leviticus 5:4). <b>Just as</b> the <b>“good”</b> mentioned in this verse is referring to <b>a voluntary</b> action, <b>so too</b> the <b>“evil”</b> is <b>voluntary,</b> e.g., if he takes an oath not to derive benefit from an item. This <b>excludes</b> a slave, whose oath or vow <b>would cause evil to others, as it is not in his power</b> to affect his master adversely. Therefore, his statement is invalid. Here too, as the owner will suffer if his slave’s diet is restricted, a slave may not accept a vow or an oath upon himself.",

Since the slave is free in practice, his vow goes into effect. <b>And Rabbi Yosei says: He may drink</b> wine, as he is not emancipated.",

            "The Gemara asks: If so, should one say that <b>Rabbi Meir is of</b> the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Shmuel,</b> and therefore the slave is obligated in naziriteship as soon as he runs away, like any other freed slave, and <b>Rabbi Yosei is of</b> the opinion that the ruling is <b>not</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of Shmuel?</b>",
            "The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No,</b> it is possible <b>that everyone is of</b> the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Shmuel.

As their presumptive status is impure, they are retroactively rendered impure, even by an impurity of the depths.",
            "Rav Hamnuna <b>said to</b> Rava: <b>I agree with you with regard to a nazirite</b> who descended to purify himself and <b>who is lacking</b> the act of <b>shaving.</b> He has yet to shave his head for his impurity and is therefore not completely pure. Consequently, he follows his prior presumptive status of impurity.",
            "<b>Rava said to him: I, too, agree with you with regard to one performing</b> the ritual of <b>the Paschal offering</b> that he is pure, <b>as he is not lacking anything.</b> Since he does not have to perform any action on his body before he can bring an offering, one can say that he already has a presumptive status of purity on the seventh day. <b>Abaye said to him: But</b> he <b>is</b> still <b>lacking sunset,</b> i.e., he is not fully pure until the sun sets on the seventh day. Rava <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>The sun sets by itself,</b> and therefore this cannot be seen as a deficiency involving an action.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>And even Abaye</b> accepted Rava’s answer and <b>retracted, as</b> can be seen from that which <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. By Torah law, a woman who gives birth to a boy is ritually impure for seven days, and a woman who gives birth to a girl is impure for fourteen days. At that point, the woman immerses in a ritual bath and is purified. Any blood that emerges from the woman during her days of purity, i.e., for forty days following the birth of a male and eighty days following the birth of a female, does not render her impure. She cannot bring the offering brought by a woman who has given birth or miscarried until she has immersed at the end of these days (see Leviticus, chapter 12). The <i>baraita</i> discusses a case where a woman who had given birth became pregnant and miscarried before she had brought her offering for the first birth.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> teaches: If a woman miscarried on <b>the day of the fulfillment</b> of her purity, on the eighty-first day after a female, <b>she must bring</b> a separate offering for the miscarried fetus, as she was obligated to bring one offering before her miscarriage. If she miscarried <b>during the fulfillment,</b> i.e., before the conclusion of the eighty days for the birth of a daughter, <b>she does not bring</b> two offerings but only one, just as is the <i>halakha</i> in the case of one who gives birth to twins.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>she should not bring</b> an offering <b>for her childbirth,</b> i.e., miscarriage, <b>that</b> occurred <b>before the fulfillment</b> of the days of her purity <b>but she should bring for her childbirth that</b> occurred <b>after</b> its <b>completion.</b> In other words, if she had yet another miscarriage, after the days of her purity for her initial birth but within the eighty days of purity following her first miscarriage, she should bring an extra offering <b>and</b> thereby <b>discharge both</b> obligations, of her birth and her final miscarriage.",
            "Therefore, to counteract this possibility, <b>the verse states: “And when the days of her purity are fulfilled…</b>she shall bring” (Leviticus 12:6). This teaches that it is only if she miscarried <b>on the day of the fulfillment</b> itself that <b>she must bring</b> an offering for a miscarriage, but if she miscarried <b>before the fulfillment</b> of the days of her purity of the earlier miscarriage, even if this occurred more than eighty days after the first birth, <b>she does not bring</b> another offering.",
            "<b>Rav Kahana said</b> in explanation: <b>Here it is different.</b> The reason why she does not bring an offering for a miscarriage during her days of purity is <b>that she lacks</b> the possibility of bringing her <b>offering.</b> Since she cannot bring her offering until the end of her term of purity, she cannot incur another obligation during this period, no matter how many births occur within eighty days of the previous one. However, this leads Rav Kahana to ask: <b>There too,</b> if she had a miscarriage on the day of the completion of her term, she cannot bring her offering either, as she <b>lacks sunset.</b> Why, then, must she bring an additional offering?",
            "<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Kahana: <b>The sun sets by itself</b> and is not considered a deficiency with regard to her purity. This discussion shows that Abaye accepted Rava’s reasoning, as he submitted the same argument himself in a different context.",

            "<b>Seize</b> the opportunity <b>and</b> quickly <b>recite a blessing</b> over the cup of blessing for the Grace after Meals. <b>And similarly, Rav Huna said to his son, Rabba: Seize</b> the opportunity <b>and recite a blessing.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that one who recites a blessing is preferable</b> to one who answers amen? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: The one who answers amen is greater than the one who recites the blessing? And Rabbi Nehorai said to him: By Heavens, it is so. Know</b> that this is true, <b>as the military assistants [<i>gulyarim</i>]</b> descend to the battlefield and <b>initiate the war and the mighty</b> follow them and <b>prevail.</b> The amen that follows a blessing is compared to the mighty who join the war after the assistants, illustrating that answering amen is more significant than reciting the initial blessing.",
            "The Gemara responds: This <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Both the one who recites a blessing and the one who answers amen are included</b> among those who “stand up and bless” (Nehemiah 9:5), <b>but one hurries to first</b> reward <b>the one who recites the blessing.</b> This <i>baraita</i> apparently holds that reciting the blessing is greater than answering amen.",
            "<b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Torah scholars increase peace in the world, as it is stated: “And all your children [<i>banayikh</i>] shall be taught of the Lord, and great shall be the peace of your children”</b> (Isaiah 54:13). The Sages interpreted this verse homiletically: Do not read it as: “Your children [<i>banayikh</i>],” but as: Your builders [<i>bonayikh</i>]. Torah scholars are those who build peace for their generation."
