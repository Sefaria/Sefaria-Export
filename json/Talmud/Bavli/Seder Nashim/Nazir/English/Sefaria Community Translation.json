            "...Rabbah the son of Bar Chana said that Rabbi Yochanan said: That which it is written (Hosea 14:10) \"for straight are the ways of Hashem and the righteous walk upon them and the sinners stumble upon them. A parable to two people that roast their paschal lambs, one eats it for the purpose of the commandment and one eats it for the purpose of gluttony. The one that eat it for the purpose of the commandment, \"and the righteous walk upon them,\" the one that eats it for the purpose of gluttony, \"and the sinners stumble upon them.\"", 
            "Reish Lakish said to him:  Is this one called an evildoer? Although he has not performed the best form of the mitzvah, he still performed the paschal lamb. Rather, it is parable to two people, this one has his wife and his sister with him and this one has his wife and his sister with him. To this one his wife is set for him and to this one his sister is set for him, the one whose wife is set for him, \"the righteous walk upon them,\" and the one whose sister is set for him, \"and the sinners stumble upon them.\"", 
            "Is this comparable? We were talking about one path, here are two paths. Rather, it is a parable to Lot and his daughters that were with him. They that intended for the sake of a commandment, \"and the righteous walk upon them,\" he that intended for the sake of sin, \"and sinners stumble upon them.\"", 
            "And maybe he too intended for sake of a commandment? Rabbi Yochanan said: This entire verse ..."
