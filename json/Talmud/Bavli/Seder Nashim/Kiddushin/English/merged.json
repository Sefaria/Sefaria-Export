            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A woman is acquired</b> by, i.e., becomes betrothed to, a man to be his wife <b>in three ways, and she acquires herself,</b> i.e., she terminates her marriage, <b>in two ways.</b> The mishna elaborates: <b>She is acquired through money, through a document, and through sexual intercourse.</b> With regard to a betrothal <b>through money,</b> there is a dispute between <i>tanna’im</i>: <b>Beit Shammai say</b> that she can be acquired <b>with one dinar or with</b> anything that is <b>worth one dinar. And Beit Hillel say:</b> She can be acquired <b>with one <i>peruta</i>,</b> a small copper coin, <b>or with</b> anything that is <b>worth one <i>peruta</i>.</b> The mishna further clarifies: <b>And how much is</b> the value of <b>one <i>peruta</i>,</b> by the fixed value of silver? The mishna explains that it is <b>one-eighth of the Italian <i>issar</i>,</b> which is a small silver coin.",
            "<b>And</b> a woman <b>acquires herself through a bill of divorce or through the death of the husband. A woman whose husband, who had a brother, died childless [<i>yevama</i></b>], can be <b>acquired</b> by the deceased husband’s brother, the <i>yavam</i>, only <b>through intercourse. And she acquires herself,</b> i.e., she is released from her levirate bond, <b>through <i>ḥalitza</i> or through the death of the <i>yavam</i>.</b>",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that <b>a woman</b> can be <b>acquired</b> in three ways. The Gemara asks: <b>What is different here that</b> this mishna <b>teaches: A woman is acquired,</b> using the language of acquisition, <b>and what is different there,</b> in the beginning of the next chapter (42a), <b>which teaches: A man betroths,</b> using the language of betrothal? The Gemara explains: In this mishna the <i>tanna</i> utilized the language of acquisition <b>because he wanted to teach</b> about betrothal through <b>money,</b> which is the standard means of exchange in an act of acquisition.",
            "The Gemara continues its explanation: <b>And from where do we</b> derive that betrothal is accomplished by means of giving <b>money?</b> It is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the term expressing <b>taking</b> stated with regard to betrothal and <b>from</b> the term expressing <b>taking</b> with regard to <b>the field of Ephron.</b> How so? <b>It is written here,</b> with regard to marriage: <b>“When a man takes a woman”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), <b>and it is written there,</b> concerning Abraham’s purchase of the field of the Cave of Machpelah from Ephron the Hittite: <b>“I will give money for the field; take it from me”</b> (Genesis 23:13). This verbal analogy teaches that just as Ephron’s field was acquired with money, so too, a woman can be acquired with money.",
            "The Gemara continues: <b>And</b> the <b>taking</b> of Ephron’s field <b>is called an acquisition</b> in the Torah, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the same issue: <b>“The field which Abraham acquired”</b> (Genesis 25:10)."
        ],
        [
            "<b>Alternatively,</b> it can be proven that purchasing a field with money is called an acquisition from the verse: <b>“They shall acquire fields with money”</b> (Jeremiah 32:44). Consequently, as the <i>tanna</i> wanted to teach that a woman can be betrothed with money, <b>he taught: A woman is acquired.</b> This explains why the terminology of acquisition is used in this mishna.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But let</b> the mishna <b>teach there,</b> in the next chapter: <b>A man acquires.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Initially,</b> the mishna <b>taught</b> using <b>the language of the Torah,</b> in which betrothal is called taking. <b>And ultimately,</b> in the next chapter, <b>it taught</b> using <b>the language of the Sages. And what</b> is the reason that betrothal is called <i>kiddushin</i>, literally, consecration, in the <b>language of the Sages?</b> The reason is <b>that</b> through betrothal the husband <b>renders her forbidden to everyone like consecrated</b> property. Therefore, this act is referred to as consecration.",
            "The Gemara asks another question with regard to the difference in wording between the two <i>mishnayot</i>: <b>And let it teach here,</b> as in the following chapter: <b>A man acquires.</b> Why does this mishna teach: The woman is acquired, with the woman as the subject of the sentence? The Gemara answers: This is <b>because</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>wanted to teach</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>And she acquires herself,</b> which is stated <b>with regard to her.</b> Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>also taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> stated <b>with regard to her</b> in <b>the first clause.</b>",
            "The Gemara further asks: <b>But</b> if this is the reason, the mishna could have been formulated entirely differently. <b>Let it teach: The man can acquire</b> a woman <b>and transfer</b> authority, i.e., grant her the release from marriage in the form of a bill of divorce. The Gemara answers: The mishna could not use the expression: Transfer, <b>because there is</b> the case of <b>the husband’s death, in</b> which <b>it is not he who transfers</b> authority. Rather, <b>it is from Heaven that</b> her freedom <b>is transferred to her.</b> Therefore, the mishna could not issue a general statement that the man can actively transfer to the woman her release from marriage.",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead another explanation. <b>If</b> the mishna had <b>taught:</b> The man <b>acquires</b> the woman, <b>I would say</b> that he can acquire her <b>even against her will,</b> as indicated by the expression: He acquires. One might have assumed that the betrothal depends on the husband, without the need for the woman’s consent. Therefore the mishna <b>taught: The woman is acquired,</b> from which it may be inferred <b>that with her consent, yes,</b> he can acquire her as a wife, but <b>when</b> he acts <b>without her consent, no,</b> she is not betrothed to him.",
            "The Gemara continues to analyze the style of the mishna: <b>And why does</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>specifically teach: Three [<i>shalosh</i>]</b> ways, formulated in the feminine? <b>Let it teach: Three [<i>shelosha</i>]</b> ways, formulated in the masculine. The Gemara explains: The mishna uses this form <b>because it wants to teach</b> the word <b>way [<i>derekh</i>], and <i>derekh</i> is formulated</b> in the <b>feminine, as it is written: “And you shall show them the way [<i>derekh</i>] in which [<i>bah</i>] they must walk”</b> (Exodus 18:20). The term <i>bah</i>, which is referring to <i>derekh</i>, is formulated in the feminine.",
            "The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>that which is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Nazir</i> 65b): <b>One examines a <i>zav</i> in seven [<i>shiva</i>] ways [<i>derakhim</i>],</b> where <i>shiva</i> is formulated in the masculine, <b>let it teach: Seven [<i>sheva</i>]</b> ways, formulated in the feminine. The Gemara answers: The mishna uses the masculine formulation of the term seven <b>because it wanted to teach: <i>Derekh</i>, and we find</b> that the word <b><i>derekh</i> is referred to</b> in the <b>masculine form, as it is written: “They shall come out against you one way [<i>derekh</i>], and shall flee before you seven [<i>shiva</i>] ways”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:7). The Gemara asks: <b>If so, the verses contradict each other,</b> as in one verse the term <i>derekh</i> is masculine, and in the other verse it is feminine. <b>And</b> furthermore, <b>the <i>mishnayot</i> contradict each other,</b> as in one mishna <i>derekh</i> is masculine while in the other it is feminine.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>The verses do not contradict each other. Here,</b> that verse: “The way in which they must walk” (Exodus 18:20), <b>is referring to the Torah,</b> i.e., the way mentioned here is referring to the path of the Torah, <b>and Torah is referred to</b> in the <b>feminine form, as it is written: “The Torah of the Lord is perfect [<i>temima</i>], restoring the soul”</b> (Psalms 19:8). The word <i>temima</i> is in the feminine. Consequently, in reference to the Torah the verse <b>writes:</b> <i>Derekh</i>, <b>formulated</b> in the <b>feminine. There, that</b> verse: “Shall flee before you seven ways” (Deuteronomy 28:7), <b>is referring to war,</b> and <b>as it is the way of a man to wage war and it is not the way of a woman to wage war,</b> it is appropriate to speak in the masculine. Therefore, the verse <b>writes</b> the word <i>derekh</i> <b>formulated</b> in the <b>masculine.</b>",
            "Likewise, the <b><i>mishnayot</i> do not contradict each other: Here, where it is referring to a woman, the mishna teaches</b> <i>derekh</i> <b>formulated</b> in the <b>feminine. There,</b> with regard to the examination of a <i>zav</i>, <b>where it is referring to a man, as</b> it is <b>common for a man to undergo an examination</b> to determine if his emission has a cause other than a gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>ziva</i>] <b>but it is not common for a woman to undergo an examination, since,</b> unlike a man, <b>a woman is rendered impure even by circumstances beyond</b> her <b>control, it taught</b> and used the word <i>derekh</i> <b>formulated</b> in the <b>masculine.</b> Even if a woman has an emission of blood for a reason other than illness, she is still impure. Consequently, in her case there is no reason for an examination to see what might have caused her discharge.",
            "The Gemara asks another question with regard to the language of the mishna: <b>What is the reason</b> that the mishna <b>teaches: Three [<i>shalosh</i>],</b> formulated in the feminine? This is <b>because</b> it wanted to teach: <b>Ways. But</b> if so, <b>let it teach</b> instead the word: <b>Matters,</b> i.e., a woman can be acquired through three matters, <b>and</b> as this term is masculine, <b>let it teach three [<i>shelosha</i>],</b> in the masculine. The Gemara answers: The mishna did do so <b>because it wanted to teach intercourse</b> as one of these ways, <b>and intercourse is called a way</b> in the Torah, <b>as it is written: “And the way of a man with a young woman, so is the way of an adulterous woman”</b> (Proverbs 30:19-20). For this reason the mishna used the term ways rather than matters.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>This works out well</b> with regard to <b>intercourse,</b> which is referred to as a way. But <b>what is there to say</b> concerning <b>money and a document?</b> The mishna could have used the word matters with regard to these modes of betrothal. The Gemara answers: <b>Because</b> it was necessary to mention <b>intercourse,</b> which is called a way, the mishna used the word way in reference to the other two modes as well.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> would the mishna <b>teach two</b> cases in a particular manner <b>due to one?</b> Since the word way suits only one of the three modes of betrothal, why didn’t the mishna use the term: Matters, on account of the other two? The Gemara answers: <b>These, too, are for the sake of sexual intercourse.</b> Since the marital relationship, in which intercourse is paramount, is the ultimate purpose of betrothal, the mishna considers this clause as the most important part of the <i>halakha</i>.",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna, which teaches <i>derekh</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: For what</b> reason <b>did the Torah say: “When a man takes a woman”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:13) <b>and did not write: “When a woman is taken by a man? Because it is the way [<i>derekh</i>] of a man to pursue a woman, and it is not the way of a woman to pursue a man.</b> The Gemara cites <b>a parable of a man who lost an item. Who searches for what?</b> Certainly <b>the owner of the lost item searches for his lost item,</b> not the other way around. Since woman was created from man’s lost side, the man seeks that which he has lost. To allude to this statement of Rabbi Shimon, the mishna employs the term <i>derekh</i> in this context.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>One examines a <i>zav</i> in seven ways,</b> why does it use this phraseology? <b>Let it teach</b> the word: <b>Matters.</b> The Gemara answers that the mishna <b>there teaches us this</b> <i>halakha</i>, <b>that it is the way of excessive eating to lead to <i>ziva</i>, and</b> likewise <b>it is the way of excessive drinking to lead to <i>ziva</i>.</b> Therefore, the mishna uses the phrase: Seven ways, to emphasize that there are ways of behavior that can cause the emission of a <i>zav</i>.",
            "The Gemara further challenges: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bikkurim</i> 2:6): The <i>halakhot</i> of <b>an <i>etrog</i></b> tree <b>correspond to</b> those of <b>a tree in three ways. Let it teach</b> instead: Three <b>matters.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Because it wants to teach in</b> the <b>latter clause: And</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of an <i>etrog</i> tree correspond <b>to</b> those of <b>a vegetable in one way,</b> therefore the mishna uses the term: Ways, in the first clause as well. The Gemara asks: In the <b>latter clause too, let</b> the mishna <b>teach: Matter,</b> rather than: Way."
        ],
        [
            "The Gemara explains: <b>There,</b> the mishna <b>teaches us this, that</b> the <b>way an <i>etrog</i></b> grows is <b>like a vegetable: Just as it is the way of a vegetable to grow by</b> being watered by <b>all water,</b> i.e., in addition to rainwater it requires irrigation, <b>and its tithing is according to when it is harvested,</b> i.e., its tithing is based on when it is collected from the field, <b>so too, it is the way of an <i>etrog</i> to grow by</b> being watered by <b>all water,</b> as it requires more water than rain provides, <b>and its tithing is according to the time when it is harvested.</b> If, for example, a vegetable is collected during a year when poor man’s tithe is given, that tithe is separated from it, even if it formed a bud during the previous year, when second tithe was separated. The same applies to an <i>etrog</i>. Therefore, the mishna specifically uses the term: Way, to allude to this reason.",
            "The Gemara further asks: <b>But</b> concerning <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bikkurim</i> 2:8): With regard to <b>a <i>koy</i>,</b> an animal whose classification was uncertain, as the Sages were unsure whether it is a domesticated or a non-domesticated animal, <b>there are ways,</b> i.e., <i>halakhot</i>, <b>in</b> which its <i>halakhot</i> <b>correspond to</b> those of <b>a non-domesticated animal and there are ways in</b> which its <i>halakhot</i> <b>correspond to</b> those of <b>a domesticated animal. And there are ways in</b> which its <i>halakhot</i> <b>correspond to</b> those of both <b>a non-domesticated animal and a domesticated animal, and there are ways in</b> which its <i>halakhot</i> <b>correspond to</b> those of <b>neither a non-domesticated animal nor a domesticated animal. Let</b> that mishna <b>teach</b> the term: <b>Matters. And furthermore,</b> with regard to <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 9a): <b>This is one of the ways in which</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>bills of divorce correspond to</b> those of bills of <b>manumission, let</b> that mishna <b>teach</b> the word: <b>Matters.</b>",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara rejects the previous explanations, as the phraseology is not dependent on the nature of the topic at hand. Instead, <b>anywhere that there is a distinction</b> with regard to an issue the mishna <b>teaches</b> the term: <b>Ways,</b> as there are different ways or possibilities available. <b>And anywhere that there is no distinction it teaches</b> the word: <b>Matters.</b> The Gemara comments: The language of the mishna <b>is also precise</b> in this regard, <b>as it teaches in the latter clause</b> of that mishna that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The <i>halakhot</i> of <b>an <i>etrog</i></b> tree <b>correspond to</b> those of <b>a tree with regard to every matter.</b> This indicates that when no distinctions apply, the mishna will use the term matter. The Gemara concludes: <b>Learn from</b> this clause in the mishna that this explanation is correct.",
            "§ The Gemara continues to analyze the language of the mishna: With regard to <b>the number in the first clause</b> of the mishna, i.e., a woman is acquired in three ways, this serves <b>to exclude what?</b> The fact that the mishna mentions a number indicates that other modes of acquisition do not apply to betrothal. What mode is excluded? Similarly, <b>the number in the latter clause</b> of the mishna, that a woman acquires herself in two ways, serves <b>to exclude what?</b>",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>The number in the first clause</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> a wedding <b>canopy,</b> which does not effect betrothal. The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna, who said:</b> A wedding <b>canopy acquires</b> a woman, and it alone could be a mode of betrothal, as derived <b>by an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference (see 5a), this number serves <b>to exclude what?</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: The number serves <b>to exclude</b> acquisition through symbolic <b>exchange,</b> i.e., a <i>pro forma</i> act of acquisition effecting the transfer of ownership of an article. Although a woman can be betrothed by means of money or an item of monetary value, she is not betrothed if she is given an item by symbolic exchange. The Gemara explains why this needs to be excluded: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since</b> the Sages <b>derive</b> the acquisition of a woman by verbal analogy between the term expressing <b>taking</b> stated with regard to betrothal <b>from</b> the term expressing <b>taking</b> with regard to <b>the field of Ephron,</b> it can be suggested that <b>just as a field can be acquired through</b> symbolic <b>exchange, so too, a woman can be acquired through</b> symbolic <b>exchange.</b> Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> perhaps one should <b>say</b> that <b>so too,</b> it is possible to betroth a woman by means of symbolic exchange. The Gemara answers: This cannot be the case, as symbolic <b>exchange is</b> effective <b>using</b> an item worth <b>less than the value of one <i>peruta</i>, and with</b> an item worth <b>less than the value of one <i>peruta</i>, a woman</b>"

            "The Gemara asks: <b>The number in the latter clause</b> of the mishna, that a woman acquires herself in two ways, serves <b>to exclude what?</b> The Gemara answers that it serves <b>to exclude <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> i.e., a woman is not released from marriage through <i>ḥalitza</i>. Without this exclusion it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that this <b>can be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a <i>yevama</i>,</b> as follows: <b>Just as a <i>yevama</i>, who is not released</b> from the <i>yavam</i> <b>through a bill of divorce, is</b> nevertheless <b>released</b> from him <b>through <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> with regard to <b>this</b> married woman, <b>who can be released</b> from her husband <b>through a bill of divorce, is it not logical that she can be released</b> from him <b>through <i>ḥalitza</i>?</b> Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that a married woman cannot be released from her husband by means of <i>ḥalitza</i>.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> perhaps one should <b>say</b> that <b>so too,</b> this is the case, i.e., a married woman can be released from marriage through <i>ḥalitza</i>. The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to divorce: <b>“A scroll of severance”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:3), which teaches: <b>A scroll,</b> i.e., a written document, <b>severs her</b> from her husband, <b>and nothing else severs her</b> from him.",
            "§ The mishna teaches that a woman can be acquired <b>with money.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that a woman can be acquired through money? <b>And furthermore,</b> with regard to <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ketubot</i> 46b): <b>A father has authority</b> over <b>his daughter with regard to her betrothal,</b> whether it is <b>through money, through a document, or through sexual intercourse, from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> she <b>is acquired</b> by her husband <b>with money, and</b> that this <b>money is her father’s?</b>",
            "<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> The reason is <b>that the verse states</b> with regard to a Hebrew maidservant acquiring freedom from her master: <b>“Then shall she go out for nothing, without money”</b> (Exodus 21:11). The extraneous phrase: Without money, indicates that <b>there is no money for this master,</b> i.e., in this case the master she leaves loses the money he paid for her, <b>but there is money for a different master,</b> i.e., another master receives money for her when she leaves his authority. <b>And who is</b> the other master who can transfer her to someone else and receives money for her? This is her <b>father.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that this money is given <b>to her?</b> The Gemara rejects this: <b>How can</b> one suggest <b>this? Her father receives her betrothal,</b> i.e., the money or document of betrothal, when he marries her off to her husband, <b>as it is written: “I gave my daughter to this man”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:16), <b>and</b> shall <b>she take the money?</b> Since he is the one who marries her off, he is certainly entitled to the money of her betrothal.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>applies</b> only when she is <b>a minor girl, as she does not have the power to receive</b> her <b>betrothal.</b> Since she lacks the intellectual capacity, she likewise does not have the legal right to conduct this transaction. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a young woman, who does have the power to receive</b> her <b>betrothal,</b> as a female older than twelve years is considered an adult, <b>let her betroth herself and take the money.</b> The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states: “Being in her youth, in her father’s house”</b> (Numbers 30:17), which teaches: <b>Any profit</b> she gains in her <b>youth</b> belongs <b>to her father.</b>",
            "The Gemara questions this explanation: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>that which Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the earnings of a daughter,</b> i.e., the profit from her labor, belongs <b>to</b> her <b>father? As it is stated: “And if a man sells his daughter as a maidservant”</b> (Exodus 21:7). This comparison between a daughter and a Hebrew maidservant teaches the following: <b>Just as</b> with regard to a Hebrew <b>maidservant, her earnings</b> belong <b>to her master, so too,</b> with regard to <b>a daughter, her earnings</b> belong <b>to her father.</b> The Gemara now asks: Why does Rav Huna need this derivation? <b>Let him derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the verse <b>“being in her youth, in her father’s house,”</b> which indicates that any profit from her earnings as a young woman belongs to her father.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> Rav Huna maintains that <b>that</b> verse <b>is written with regard to the nullification of vows,</b> and it is not referring to the <i>halakhot</i> of acquisition. The Gemara asks: If that is so, then <b>so too,</b> with regard to her betrothal money, one can say that this verse <b>is written</b> only <b>with regard to the nullification of vows</b> and does not apply to betrothal money. <b>And if you would say: Let us derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of her betrothal money <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the nullification of vows, i.e., just as a father has the right to nullify his daughter’s vows when she is a young woman, so too, he has rights to her money, this is not possible, as there is a principle: <b>We do not derive monetary matters from ritual matters.</b>",
            "<b>And if you would say: Let us derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> of the betrothal of a young woman <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>fines,</b> as it is stated explicitly in the Torah that a man who rapes a young woman must pay a fine to her father, there is another principle that is applicable here: <b>We do not derive monetary matters from fines,</b> as the imposition of a fine is considered a unique case from which ordinary monetary rights cannot be derived.",
            "<b>And if you would say: Let us derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the reimbursements for the <b>humiliation and degradation</b> of a young woman who was raped, which are also given to the father, one can answer that the following distinction applies: Reimbursement for <b>humiliation and degradation</b> are <b>different, as her father has an interest in them.</b> The father has the ability to derive benefit from her humiliation and degradation in other ways, e.g., by marrying her to a man afflicted with boils, which would humiliate her and cause a reduction in her value. Therefore, one cannot derive from the fact that the father receives the reimbursements for the humiliation and degradation of a young woman who was raped that he receives other monies due to her.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> that a young woman’s betrothal money belongs to her father is derived from the verse: “Then shall she go out for nothing, without money” (Exodus 21:11), as previously stated. As for the question why the money does not belong to her, the Gemara answers that <b>it is reasonable that when</b> the verse <b>excludes</b> another situation and indicates that there is no money for this master but there is money for a different master,"

            "<b>it excludes a departure</b> that is <b>like it,</b> i.e., a departure wherein the two masters are the potential recipients.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But this departure is not similar to that departure,</b> as <b>there, she leaves the authority of the master entirely</b> upon being freed and she no longer retains any connection to him, <b>and here, she still lacks</b> the act of <b>passing</b> her over <b>to the</b> wedding <b>canopy.</b> Until she actually enters the wedding canopy, she has not left her father’s authority completely. The Gemara answers: Nevertheless, there is a similarity between her departures in both cases, as <b>she leaves</b> her father’s <b>authority at least as</b> far as <b>the nullification of vows</b> is concerned. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Nedarim</i> 66b): With regard to <b>a betrothed young woman, her father and her husband</b> together <b>nullify her vows,</b> and her father cannot nullify them alone.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> does <b>this</b> verse: <b>“Then shall she go out for nothing”</b> (Exodus 21:11), <b>come for that</b> purpose, to teach that there is no money for this master, but there is money for a different master? <b>But it is required for that which is taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse “Then shall she go out for nothing, without money” should be understood as follows: <b>“Then shall she go out for nothing”; these</b> words <b>are</b> referring to <b>the days of adulthood,</b> i.e., a Hebrew maidservant leaves her owner’s authority once she becomes an adult. <b>“Without money [<i>ein kasef</i>]”; these</b> words <b>are</b> referring to <b>the days of</b> her <b>youth,</b> i.e., when she becomes a young woman she leaves his authority.",

            "With regard to the last derivation, the Gemara asks: <b>But you have</b> already <b>derived</b> one <i>halakha</i> from this word, that <b>her children’s children</b> are considered like her children in this case. The Gemara answers: In fact, <b>a verse was not necessary</b> to teach about <b>her children’s children, as</b> there is an established principle that <b>children’s children are</b> considered <b>like children.</b> And therefore, <b>when the verse was necessary,</b> it was to teach the requirement of examining her <b>for children</b> of <b>flawed</b> lineage.",

            "<b>Rabba says: This</b> phrase <b>comes and teaches about that</b> phrase. In other words, since it is not explicitly stated that this particular verse is referring to her departure when she becomes a young woman, if there was only one superfluous phrase one would conclude that it is referring to adulthood, as the <i>halakha</i> that she leaves the master when she becomes an adult is a lesser novelty. Therefore, two extraneous verses are required.",
            "Rabba cites an analogous case. This is <b>just as it is</b> with regard to <b>a tenant and a hired worker. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning <i>teruma</i>: The verse states: “A tenant of a priest or a hired worker shall not eat of the consecrated” (Leviticus 22:10). <b>“A tenant”; this</b> is referring to a Hebrew slave <b>who has been acquired as a permanent acquisition,</b> i.e., one who said he wishes to stay with his master. This Hebrew slave has his ear pierced and he remains with his master until the Jubilee Year. <b>“A hired worker”; this</b> is referring to a Hebrew slave who has been <b>acquired for an acquisition of</b> six <b>years,</b> the standard period of servitude for a Hebrew slave.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>Let</b> the verse <b>say “tenant” and let it not say “hired worker,” and I</b> would <b>say:</b> If one who is acquired <b>as a permanent acquisition does not partake</b> of his owner’s, i.e., the priest’s, <i>teruma</i>, as despite his status as a Hebrew slave he is not considered his owner’s property, is it <b>not all the more so</b> that <b>one who is acquired for an acquisition of</b> six <b>years</b> should not be permitted to partake of <i>teruma</i>?",
            "The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>If so,</b> that the verse were stated in this manner, <b>I would say: “A tenant”; this is one who was acquired for an acquisition of</b> six <b>years,</b> as the term itself is ambiguous. <b>But one who was acquired as a permanent acquisition may partake</b> of <i>teruma</i>. Therefore, the term <b>“hired worker,”</b> which is certainly referring to one who is less permanent than a tenant, <b>comes and teaches about</b> the meaning of the term <b>“tenant,” that even if</b> a Hebrew slave <b>was acquired as a permanent acquisition he may not partake</b> of <i>teruma</i>. A similar line of reasoning applies in the above case of a young woman and an adult.",
            "<b>Abaye said to</b> Rabba: <b>Are</b> these cases really <b>comparable?

The reason is that, although the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a hired worker is a matter</b> that could <b>be derived by</b> means of <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, and therefore it does not have to be stated explicitly, there is a principle: Sometimes with regard to <b>a matter that can be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, the <b>verse</b> nevertheless <b>takes the trouble and writes it</b> explicitly.",

The Gemara rejects this claim: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about money is that</b> it can effect acquisition in many contexts, <b>as one can redeem with it consecrated</b> property <b>and second tithe.</b> This is not so with regard to a wedding canopy, which is ineffective in effecting any acquisition other than marriage. Therefore, in the case of betrothal, money can effect betrothal while a wedding canopy cannot. The Gemara counters: The <i>halakha</i> of <b>sexual intercourse proves</b> otherwise, as this act serves to effect acquisition of a woman despite the fact that it is not a valid mode of acquisition in any other case.",
            "The Gemara counters: <b>What</b> is unique about <b>sexual intercourse</b> is <b>that it effects acquisition of a <i>yevama</i>,</b> whereas a <i>yavam</i> does not acquire her via a wedding canopy. The Gemara answers: <b>Money proves</b> otherwise, as money cannot be used to acquire a <i>yevama</i>, and yet it is a valid mode for acquiring a woman. <b>And the derivation has reverted</b> to its starting point: <b>The aspect of this</b> mode, money, <b>is not like the aspect of that</b> mode, intercourse, <b>and the aspect of that</b> mode, intercourse, <b>is not like the aspect of this</b> mode, money. <b>Their common denominator is that they generally effect acquisition, and they effect acquisition here,</b> with regard to betrothal. <b>Likewise, I will bring</b> the mode of a wedding <b>canopy, which generally effects acquisition,</b> rendering a woman as married, <b>and</b> therefore it should also <b>effect acquisition here.</b>",
            "The Gemara rejects this: <b>What</b> about the fact that <b>the common denominator of</b> money and intercourse is <b>that their benefit,</b> i.e., pleasure, <b>is great?</b> The Gemara says: The case of <b>a document proves</b> otherwise, as no great pleasure is derived from receiving a document, and yet it can be used to acquire a woman. The Gemara answers: <b>What</b> is unique about <b>a document is that it can release a Jewish woman</b> from her husband in the form of a bill of divorce. The Gemara answers: <b>Money and intercourse prove</b> otherwise, as they do not release a woman and yet they are valid modes of acquisition for betrothal.",
            "<b>And</b> once again, <b>the derivation has reverted</b> to its starting point: <b>The aspect of this</b> mode <b>is not like the aspect of that</b> mode, <b>and the aspect of that</b> mode <b>is not like the aspect of this</b> mode. <b>Their common denominator is that they generally effect acquisition and they effect acquisition here,</b> with regard to betrothal. <b>Likewise, I will bring</b> the mode of a wedding <b>canopy, which generally effects acquisition, and</b> therefore it should also <b>effect acquisition here.</b>",
            "The Gemara again rejects this claim: <b>What</b> about the fact that <b>the common denominator of</b> all three modes of acquisition is <b>that they are</b> effective in certain situations <b>against her will?</b> A bill of divorce, sexual intercourse in the case of a <i>yevama</i>, and money with regard to a Hebrew maidservant all effect acquisition of a woman against her will. Therefore, the mode of a wedding canopy cannot be derived from these methods, as a wedding canopy is effective only when the woman enters it willingly. <b>And</b> in response to this claim <b>Rav Huna</b> would answer: <b>In any event, with regard to marriage, we have not found</b> a case in which a woman can be acquired through <b>money against her will.</b> Consequently, it is possible to learn from the modes of money, a document, and intercourse that a wedding canopy likewise effects betrothal.",
            "<b>Rava said:</b> There are <b>two refutations of</b> this <b>matter,</b> i.e., it is possible to refute Rav Huna’s opinion in two ways. <b>One</b> opinion is <b>that we learned</b> in the mishna that a woman can be acquired through <b>three</b> modes of acquisition, <b>and we did not learn</b> that there are <b>four</b> modes. This indicates that there are no other ways to acquire a woman apart from the three listed in the mishna.",
            "<b>And furthermore,</b> Rava disagrees with the main point of the proof, which was based on the fact that a wedding canopy completes a marriage: <b>Doesn’t</b> entering a wedding <b>canopy complete</b> a marriage <b>only by</b> means of an act of <b>betrothal,</b> which precedes the wedding canopy? <b>And can one derive</b> that entering a wedding <b>canopy</b> effects acquisition <b>without betrothal from</b> the case of entering a wedding <b>canopy that</b> effects acquisition <b>by</b> means of <b>betrothal?</b> Consequently, entering a wedding canopy alone cannot effect a betrothal.",
            "<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava in response to his two claims: With regard to <b>that which you said,</b> that <b>we learned</b> in the mishna <b>three</b> modes <b>and we did not learn</b> that there are <b>four</b> modes, this is no proof, as the <b><i>tanna</i> teaches</b> only <b>a matter that is explicitly written</b> in the Torah, and <b>does not teach a matter that is not explicitly written</b> in the Torah, such as a wedding canopy.",
            "<b>And</b> with regard to <b>that which you said: Doesn’t</b> entering a wedding <b>canopy complete</b> a marriage <b>only by</b> means of an act of <b>betrothal, this is also what Rav Huna is saying,</b> i.e., Rav Huna incorporates this claim into his reasoning: <b>If money, which does not complete</b> a marriage <b>after money,</b> i.e., after a woman has been betrothed through money an additional monetary gift cannot render her a fully married woman, <b>effects acquisition</b> of the woman in the form of betrothal, <b>is it not logical that</b> entering a wedding <b>canopy,</b> which is more powerful than money in that it <b>completes</b> a marriage <b>after money, should effect acquisition</b> and be used to perform betrothal by itself?",
            "§ After discussing the sources for the modes of acquisition listed in the mishna, the Gemara analyzes these <i>halakhot</i> in greater detail. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:1): <b>How</b> is betrothal performed <b>through money?</b> If a man <b>gave</b> a woman <b>money or</b> an item <b>worth money, and</b> he <b>said to her: You are hereby betrothed [<i>mekuddeshet</i>] to me,</b> or: <b>You are hereby betrothed [<i>me’oreset</i>] to me,</b> or: <b>You are to me as a wife,</b> then <b>she is betrothed. But</b> if <b>she</b> is the one <b>who gave</b> the money to him, <b>and she said: I am hereby betrothed [<i>mekuddeshet</i>] to you,</b> or: <b>I am hereby betrothed [<i>me’oreset</i>] to you,</b> or: <b>I am hereby to you as a wife,</b> then <b>she is not betrothed.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Pappa objects to this:</b> This <i>baraita</i> contains an internal contradiction. The first part of the <i>baraita</i> states: If a man gave a woman money and said to her: You are hereby betrothed to me, from which it may be inferred <b>that the reason</b> the woman is betrothed is that <b>he gave</b> her money <b>and he said</b> the appropriate formula. This leads to the conclusion that if <b>he gave</b> her money <b>and she said</b> the formula, <b>she is not betrothed.</b> Now <b>say the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>But</b> if <b>she</b> is the one <b>who gave</b> the money to him, <b>and she said:</b> I am hereby betrothed to you, then <b>it is not</b> a valid <b>betrothal.</b> Rav Pappa infers: <b>The reason</b> that it is not a valid betrothal is that <b>she gave</b> money to him <b>and she said</b> the appropriate formula, from which it may be inferred that if <b>he gave</b> money to her <b>and she said</b> the appropriate formula, then <b>this is</b> a valid <b>betrothal.</b>",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>The first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> is <b>exact,</b> and therefore it is correct to infer that which was not explicitly stated from this ruling. By contrast, <b>the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> was <b>cited for no reason,</b> i.e., it was simply formulated in the opposite manner of the first clause, and the <i>baraita</i> is not exact in the wording of this case. Therefore, one should not analyze this clause too carefully and infer <i>halakhot</i> from it. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> would the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach</b> in <b>the latter clause a matter that contradicts the first clause?</b>",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara retracts the previous explanation in favor of the following. <b>This is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> If <b>he gave</b> the money <b>and he said</b> the formula, it <b>is obvious that it is</b> a valid <b>betrothal.</b> If <b>he gave</b> the money <b>and she said</b> the formula, <b>it is considered as though she gave</b> the money <b>and she said</b> the formula, <b>and</b> therefore <b>it is not</b> a valid <b>betrothal. And if you wish, say</b> a different explanation of the <i>baraita</i>: If <b>he gave</b> the money and <b>he said</b> the formula, <b>she is betrothed.</b> If <b>she gave</b> the money <b>and she said</b> the formula, <b>she is not betrothed</b> at all. If <b>he gave</b> the money <b>and she said</b> the formula, the ruling <b>is uncertain, and by rabbinic law we are concerned</b> that this might actually be a betrothal.",
            "The Gemara continues to discuss the language of betrothal. <b>Shmuel says: With regard to betrothal,</b> if <b>he gave her money or</b> an item <b>worth money, and said to her: You are hereby betrothed [<i>mekuddeshet</i>],</b> or: <b>You are hereby betrothed [<i>me’oreset</i>],</b> or: <b>You are hereby as a wife,</b> then <b>she is betrothed.</b> If he said: <b>I am hereby your man,</b> or: <b>I am hereby your husband,</b> or: <b>I am hereby your betrothed,</b> then <b>there is no room for concern here.</b> In these cases there is no possibility that it might be a valid betrothal, as betrothal is effective only if its formulation defines the relationship in terms of the woman’s connection to the man, not the reverse.",
            "<b>And similarly, with regard to divorce,</b> if a husband <b>gave</b> his wife a bill of divorce <b>and said to her: You are hereby sent away,</b> or: <b>You are hereby divorced,</b> or: <b>You are hereby permitted to</b> marry <b>any man,</b> then <b>she is divorced.</b> If he said: <b>I am not your man,</b> or: <b>I am not your husband,</b> or: <b>I am not your betrothed,</b> then <b>there is no room for concern,</b> as a bill of divorce is effective only if its formulation defines the relationship in terms of the woman’s connection to the man, not the reverse.",
            "<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: Is this to say that Shmuel holds</b> that <b>ambiguous intimations,</b> i.e., incomplete expressions that can be understood only from their context, <b>are</b> considered like unambiguous <b>intimations?</b> In the cases listed by Shmuel, the woman is betrothed despite the fact that the man did not say: You are hereby betrothed to me, but merely: You are hereby betrothed. The statement itself does not include the detail that the speaker intends to betroth her to himself, and yet Shmuel maintains that the betrothal is valid.",
            "Rav Pappa asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Nazir</i> 2a) that <b>one who says: I shall be, is a nazirite? And we discussed</b> this ruling: <b>But perhaps</b> he meant <b>to say: I will be in a fast? And Shmuel said</b> that <b>this</b> mishna <b>is</b> referring to a particular set of circumstances, that he said: I shall be, <b>when a nazirite was passing before him.</b> In that context it is clear the individual meant that he too will be a nazirite. Rav Pappa analyzes this statement: <b>The reason</b> that he is a nazirite is only due to the fact <b>that a nazirite passes before him.</b> But <b>if this</b> were <b>not</b> the case, <b>no,</b> his statement would not be considered a naziriteship vow. This indicates that according to Shmuel, ambiguous intimations are not considered like unambiguous intimations.",
            "The Gemara rejects this: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> Shmuel is referring to a case <b>where he said</b> the formulation and added the phrase: <b>To me.</b> For example, he said to a woman: You are hereby betrothed to me. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, what is</b> Shmuel <b>teaching us?</b> If the man stated the full formula it is obvious that she is betrothed, as he used the standard expression of betrothal. The Gemara answers: <b>These</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>last expressions</b> are <b>what he teaches us.</b> The novelty of Shmuel’s statement is that with regard to the second set of pronouncements there is no concern at all that a valid betrothal or divorce might have been performed. The Gemara explains why according to Shmuel these pronouncements are not of concern. <b>Here,</b> in the case of betrothal, it is <b>written: “When</b> a man <b>takes</b> a woman” (Deuteronomy 24:1), which indicates that the man is acting to change the status of the woman, <b>and</b> it is <b>not</b> written <b>that he takes himself</b> or gives himself to her, as in the case of one who says: I am hereby your man. <b>And</b> likewise, it is <b>written here,</b> with regard to divorce: <b>“And sends her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), <b>and</b> it is <b>not</b> written <b>that he sends himself</b> from her, as in the case of one who says: I am not your man.",
            "<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that if a man says to a woman: <b>You are hereby my wife,</b> or: <b>You are hereby my betrothed,</b> or: <b>You are hereby acquired to me,</b> then <b>she is betrothed.</b> If he said to her: <b>You are hereby mine,</b> or: <b>You are hereby under my authority,</b> or: <b>You are hereby bound to me,</b> then <b>she is betrothed.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> as the <i>halakha</i> is that she is betrothed with regard to both sets of statements, <b>let</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach all of them together.</b> Why does the <i>baraita</i> divide these statements into two groups? The Gemara answers: <b>The <i>tanna</i> heard them as two sets of three, and</b> consequently <b>he taught them</b> in that form. He heard each sequence of three cases as a separate <i>halakha</i> from his teachers, and therefore he preserved them as two sets of three.",
            "<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If a man betrothing a woman said: You are hereby <b>unique to me, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is this woman betrothed? Similarly, if he said to her: You are hereby <b>designated to me, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If he said: You are hereby <b>my helper, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If he said: You are hereby <b>my counterpart, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If he said: You are hereby <b>my gathered one, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If he said: You are hereby <b>my rib, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If he said: You are hereby <b>my closed one, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?

Finally, if he said: You are hereby <b>my taken one, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Resolve at least one</b> of these dilemmas, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who says</b> to a woman: You are hereby <b>my taken one, she is betrothed, because it is stated: “When a man takes a woman”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1).",
            "<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If a man says to a woman: You are hereby <b>my espoused one [<i>ḥarufati</i>], what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that with regard to <b>one who says:</b> You are hereby <b>my espoused one, she is betrothed, as in Judea they call a betrothed woman a <i>ḥarufa</i>, an espoused woman.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And is Judea most of the world?</b> Even if this is true in Judea, why should a <i>halakha</i> that applies in all locations be based on this local custom?",
            "The Gemara answers that <b>this is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> With regard to <b>one who says:</b> You are hereby <b>my espoused one, she is betrothed, as it is stated: “Who is a maidservant espoused [<i>neḥerefet</i>] to a man”</b> (Leviticus 19:20). This verse means that she is betrothed to a certain man. <b>And furthermore,</b> the <i>baraita</i> adds another proof for this claim: <b>In Judea they call a betrothed woman a <i>ḥarufa</i>, an espoused woman.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it reasonable to introduce the custom in <b>Judea</b> with the term: <b>And furthermore,</b> as proof <b>to</b> a <i>halakha</i> derived from <b>a verse? Rather,</b> the Gemara explains that <b>this is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> With regard to <b>one who says:</b> You are hereby <b>espoused, in Judea, she is betrothed, as in Judea they call a betrothed woman a <i>ḥarufa</i>, an espoused woman.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks a general question with regard to all the previously mentioned expressions: <b>With what are we dealing? If we say</b> that these dilemmas are referring to a case <b>where he was not speaking with her about matters of her bill of divorce or her betrothal,</b> but suddenly issued this statement to her, <b>from where does she know what he is saying to her?</b> Out of context, these statements are not necessarily referring to betrothal. <b>Rather,</b> they are referring to a case <b>where he was speaking to her about matters of her bill of divorce and her betrothal.</b> But if so, <b>even though he did not say</b> anything, she would <b>also</b> be betrothed if he gave her money for the purpose of betrothal.",
            "<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ma’aser Sheni</i> 4:7): If <b>one was speaking with a woman about matters of her bill of divorce or her betrothal, and he gave her a bill of divorce or her betrothal,</b> i.e., the money or a document of betrothal, <b>but did not clarify</b> his action, <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> This <b>is sufficient for him,</b> i.e., it is a valid divorce or betrothal because she will understand his intention from the context. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: He is required to clarify</b> the meaning of his behavior. <b>And Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b> If so, even if he said nothing to her she would still be betrothed, and this should certainly be the case if he says one of the statements under discussion.",
            "The Sages <b>say</b> in explanation of this matter: <b>Actually,</b> we are dealing with cases <b>where he was speaking to her about matters of her bill of divorce and her betrothal, and if</b> it was referring to a case <b>where he</b> had <b>given her</b> the money <b>and been silent, so too</b> it would have been a valid betrothal. <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> This is a case <b>where he gave her</b> something <b>and said to her</b> one <b>of these expressions.</b>",
            "<b>And this is the dilemma raised before</b> the Sages: <b>These expressions, did he say them to her for</b> the purpose of <b>betrothal, or perhaps he said</b> them <b>to her for</b> the purpose of <b>labor?</b> He might have intended to hire her, withdrawing his previous intention to betroth her. In other words, his statement in conjunction with his giving of an item renders the meaning of the expression less clear than if he had remained silent. The Gemara leaves most of these issues unanswered, and states that the dilemmas <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.",
            "§ The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself:</b> If <b>he was speaking to the woman about matters of her bill of divorce or her betrothal, and he gave her bill of divorce or her betrothal to her and did not clarify</b> his intention, <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> This <b>is sufficient for him.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And if they were not discussing the same issue, from where does she know what he is saying to her?</b> They have already changed the topic of conversation, and these expressions on their own are ambiguous. <b>Abaye said:</b> They have not changed to an entirely different topic; rather, they changed <b>from</b> discussing one <b>topic to</b> discussing another <b>topic within the same</b> general <b>topic.</b> In other words, they were no longer speaking directly about divorce or betrothal, but they were still discussing related matters.

Although this woman owes the man money, at the time the man states that she is betrothed to him, the loan is not in fact money but an obligation. Therefore, he does not actually give her anything at the time of the betrothal. By contrast, if he betroths her <b>by</b> means of <b>the benefit of the loan, she is betrothed.

He is receiving full payment of the loan and an additional benefit. <b>And furthermore,</b> when he releases her from the obligation to pay this additional coin, he is simply forgoing another obligation she has toward him; he is not giving her anything. <b>This is</b> like a regular case of a betrothal with <b>a loan,</b> and therefore she should not be betrothed.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where he extended the time</b> of the loan <b>for her.</b> When the time for her to repay the loan arrived he extended the deadline and betrothed her with the financial benefit she receives from the extra time he is giving her to use the money.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>What does Rava maintain?

            "<b>And furthermore, Rava is the one who says: A gift given on the condition that it is</b> later <b>returned is called a gift.

This indicates that the betrothal does not take effect until the entire one hundred dinars has been paid.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> This is a case <b>where he says</b> to the woman: Be betrothed to me <b>with this one hundred dinars.</b> In this case the entire one hundred dinars, not just the first dinar, constitutes the betrothal money. The Gemara raises a difficulty with this answer: <b>From</b> the fact that <b>the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> uses the expression: <b>With this one hundred dinars,</b> it can be inferred that <b>the first clause</b> is dealing with <b>an unspecified one hundred dinars.</b>",
            "<b>As it is taught in the latter clause</b> of that <i>baraita</i>, if <b>he said</b> to a woman: <b>Be betrothed to me with this one hundred dinars, and it was found to be one hundred dinars less a dinar, or</b> if it included <b>a dinar of copper</b> instead of silver, <b>she is not betrothed.</b> If one of the dinars was found to be <b>a flawed dinar,</b> i.e., it was a silver dinar but it was so worn that it would not be universally accepted, <b>she is betrothed, and he must exchange</b> that dinar for a different one. Since the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i> emphasizes the term: This one hundred dinars, evidently the first clause of the <i>baraita</i> must be referring to an unspecified one hundred dinars.",
            "The Gemara rejects this opinion: <b>No;</b> one can say that the <b>first clause and the latter clause</b> are both referring to a case <b>where he said: With this one hundred dinars, and</b> the latter clause <b>is explaining</b> the first clause, as follows: If <b>one of them wishes to retract the</b> betrothal, <b>it is in the power</b> of either of them to do so <b>even when</b> only <b>the last</b> dinar remains to be given. <b>How so?</b> This is referring to a case <b>where he said to her: With this one hundred dinars.</b>",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>And so too, it is reasonable</b> to explain the <i>baraita</i> this way, <b>as, if it enters your mind</b> that <b>the first clause</b> is referring <b>to an unspecified one hundred dinars,</b> consider the following: <b>Now</b> if <b>it is not a betrothal in</b> a case involving <b>an unspecified one hundred dinars,</b> and she can retract her agreement to the betrothal, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to say that she can retract it when he says: <b>With this one hundred dinars?</b> If that were the correct interpretation of the first clause, the ruling in the last clause would be unnecessary.",
            "The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>If it is due to that</b> reason, <b>there is no</b> conclusive <b>argument,</b> i.e., the proof of the argument is inconclusive. The reason is that one could say that the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught the latter clause to reveal</b> the meaning of <b>the first clause.</b> The function of the latter clause is not to teach a novel <i>halakha</i>, but to preempt a mistaken reading of the first clause. The latter clause was stated so <b>that you should not</b> mistakenly <b>say that the first clause</b> is referring only to a situation when he said: <b>With this one hundred dinars, but in</b> a case of <b>an unspecified one hundred dinars, it</b> would be <b>a betrothal.</b> Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> in <b>the latter clause: With this one hundred dinars,</b> which teaches <b>by inference that the first clause</b> is referring <b>to an unspecified one hundred dinars, and even so it is not a betrothal.</b> Although this proof is rejected, the Gemara remains with its explanation that the first clause is referring to a case where he said to her: With this one hundred dinars.",
            "<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> It is unnecessary to explain that the first clause of the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case where he said: With this one hundred dinars, as a situation where he <b>was counting</b> the money <b>is different.</b> The reason is <b>that she has the entirety</b> of the one hundred dinars <b>in mind,</b> and therefore she will not be content with some of the money. His continuous action indicates that they both expect that he will give her the entire one hundred dinars, and consequently both parties can retract their agreement until he finishes counting.",
            "The Gemara further analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>What are the circumstances of this copper dinar</b> mentioned here? <b>If she knows that it</b> is a copper dinar, <b>she knew and accepted</b> this coin as a dinar. If so, she cannot later retract her betrothal. The Gemara answers: <b>No;</b> it is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where he gave her</b> this dinar <b>at night</b> and at the time she did not see that it was copper. <b>Alternatively, it was found among</b> the other <b>dinars,</b> and she did not notice that one of them one was copper.",
            "The Gemara further asks: <b>What are the circumstances of this flawed dinar,</b> also mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>? <b>If it cannot be spent,</b> i.e., it cannot pass as a silver dinar, <b>this is</b> exactly like <b>a copper dinar,</b> as it too is not worth a full dinar. <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> This is referring to a case <b>where</b> the dinar <b>can be spent with difficulty,</b> i.e., it is difficult, but not impossible, to find someone who will accept it.",

            "<b>Rabbi Abba bar Memel objects to this:</b> The above suggestion, that both money and sexual intercourse are required for betrothal, cannot be the correct interpretation of the verse: “When a man takes a woman and engages in sexual intercourse with her.” This is because, <b>if</b> it is <b>so,</b> that a woman can be acquired only through both betrothal money and intercourse, the case of one who engages in intercourse with <b>a betrothed young woman,</b> concerning which <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah that he is punished <b>by stoning</b> (see Deuteronomy 22:23–24)<b>, how can you find</b> a case where he is liable to be punished in this manner?",
            "Rabbi Abba bar Memel elaborates: <b>If</b> this is referring to a case <b>where he betrothed</b> her with money <b>and then engaged in sexual intercourse</b> with her, <b>she is a non-virgin,</b> and the punishment of stoning applies only to one who engages in intercourse with a betrothed young virgin. <b>If</b> it is referring to a case <b>where he betrothed</b> her with money <b>and did not engage in intercourse</b> with her, this <b>is nothing,</b> as the betrothal has not been completed. <b>The Rabbis said before Abaye: You find it</b> in a case <b>where</b> he betrothed her with money and then the <b>betrothed man engaged in intercourse with her in an atypical manner,</b> i.e., anal intercourse. Despite the fact that she is still a virgin, the betrothal has taken effect by means of this type of sexual intercourse.",
            "<b>Abaye said to</b> those Sages: The verse cannot be explained in that manner, as <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and the Rabbis disagree only with regard to another</b> man, i.e., whether a woman is considered to be a virgin after engaging in anal intercourse with another man. <b>But</b> with regard to her <b>husband, everyone agrees</b> that <b>if he engages in intercourse in an atypical manner with her he has rendered her a non-virgin.</b> If so, she is no longer considered a virgin with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of a betrothed young woman.",
            "The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is</b> the dispute to which Abaye refers? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 10:4): If <b>ten men engaged in sexual intercourse with</b> a betrothed young woman, <b>and she is still a virgin,</b> as they engaged in anal intercourse with her, <b>they are all</b> punished <b>by stoning. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: I say</b> that <b>the first</b> one is punished <b>by stoning,</b> as he engaged in intercourse with a virgin young woman, <b>but all</b> the others are punished <b>by strangulation.</b> Once the first man engages in intercourse with her she is no longer considered a virgin, even if he engaged in anal intercourse with her.",

If a young woman is betrothed by means of a document, she can be a betrothed young woman while remaining a virgin.",
            "The Gemara returns to the different derivations of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and Rabbi Yoḥanan. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who maintains that the mode of betrothal through intercourse is derived from the verse: “If a man be found lying with a married woman [<i>beulat ba’al</i>]” (Deuteronomy 22:22), what does he <b>do with this</b> verse: “When a man takes a woman <b>and engages in sexual intercourse with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1)? The Gemara answers: <b>He requires that</b> verse for a different <i>halakha</i>, as he maintains that it teaches that <b>this</b> woman <b>can be acquired through intercourse, but a Hebrew maidservant cannot be acquired through intercourse.</b>",
            "As it might <b>enter your mind to say: Let</b> the <i>halakha</i> of a Hebrew maidservant <b>be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a <i>yevama</i>: Just as a <i>yevama</i>, who cannot be acquired through money</b> at all, nevertheless <b>can be acquired through intercourse,</b> which indicates that the ability of an act of sexual intercourse to effect acquisition is greater than that of money, <b>is it not logical that this</b> Hebrew maidservant, <b>who can be acquired through money, can</b> also <b>be acquired through intercourse?</b>",
            "The Gemara rejects this opinion: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about a <i>yevama</i> is that she is bound and standing</b> waiting for the <i>yavam</i>, i.e., there is already a connection between them. Perhaps it is for this reason that intercourse enables a <i>yavam</i> to acquire a <i>yevama</i>, and the same cannot be said of a maidservant. Rather, it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> a different claim: <b>Since it is written</b> with regard to a the master of a Hebrew maidservant: <b>“If he take himself another</b> wife” (Exodus 21:10), this <b>verse juxtaposes</b> a Hebrew maidservant <b>with another</b> woman that a master marries: <b>Just as another</b> woman that a master marries <b>can be acquired through intercourse, so too, a Hebrew maidservant can be acquired through intercourse.

She therefore <b>thinks: If I throw them and they break I will be obligated</b> to pay <b>for them,</b> as would anyone who destroys another person’s property. Consequently, her silence is interpreted as consent only to continue in her role of holding it as a deposit. By contrast, <b>here he gives them to her as betrothal</b> money so that they would belong to her. <b>And if it is so, that she is not amenable</b> to being betrothed, <b>let her throw them</b> away.",
            "<b>Rav Aḥai refutes</b> this argument: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>all women are learned</b> in <b><i>halakha</i>?</b> In this case <b>also, she thinks: If I throw them and they break I will be responsible for them.</b> Therefore, I will not throw them.

            "§ The Gemara relates: <b>When Rabbi Asi died, the Sages assembled to collect his statements,</b> i.e., they wished to review his rulings of <i>halakha</i> lest they be forgotten. <b>A certain</b> member <b>of the Sages, and Rabbi Ya’akov was his name, said to them: This</b> is what <b>Rabbi Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Mani said: Just as a woman cannot be acquired by less than the value of one <i>peruta</i>, so</b> too <b>land cannot be acquired by less than the value of one <i>peruta</i>. They said to him: But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Although a woman cannot be acquired by less than the value of one <i>peruta</i>, land can be acquired by less than the value of one <i>peruta</i>?</b>",
            "Rabbi Ya’akov <b>said to them: When that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught</b> to the effect that land can be acquired by less than the value of one <i>peruta</i> but a woman cannot, it was <b>with regard to</b> acquisition through symbolic <b>exchange,</b> i.e., a legal act of acquisition formalizing the transfer of ownership of an article. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One can acquire</b> land and movable items through a symbolic exchange <b>by</b> giving <b>a vessel, even though it is not worth one <i>peruta</i>.</b>",
            "<b>They then sat and said</b> additional statements in the name of Rabbi Asi. One statement concerned <b>that which Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Anyone who does not know the nature of bills of divorce and betrothals should have no dealings in them,</b> as his ignorance might lead people to commit serious sins. In this context, <b>Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: And</b> those who deal with these issues without proper knowledge <b>are worse for the world than the generation of the flood, as it is stated: “Swearing and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery. They break all bounds, and blood touches blood”</b> (Hosea 4:2).",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred</b> that this verse is referring to individuals of this kind and that they are worse for the world than the generation of the flood? The Gemara explains: <b>As Rav Yosef translated</b> the phrase “and committing adultery, they break all bounds, and blood touches blood,” as: <b>They give birth to children through the wives of others; they add sins upon sins.</b>",
            "<b>And it is written</b> in the next verse: <b>“Therefore the land mourns and everyone who dwells there languishes, with the beasts of the field and the fowls of heaven, and the fishes of the sea are also taken away”</b> (Hosea 4:3).

The explicit mention of dry land indicates that <b>the fish in the sea did not</b> die. <b>But here,</b> in the punishment described in the verses in Hosea, <b>even the fish in the sea</b> died.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that this punishment is not administered <b>until they perform all of them,</b> i.e., only if they commit all of the sins mentioned in the verse, including taking false oaths, committing murder, and stealing. The Gemara answers: It should <b>not enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as it is written: “For because of swearing the land mourns”</b> (Jeremiah 23:10). This verse teaches that on account of taking false oaths alone the world can be destroyed, from which it may be inferred that each these acts on its own is enough to warrant destruction.",
            "The Gemara further asks: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that taking a false <b>oath is distinct,</b> as it involves the desecration of God’s name, <b>and these</b> other sins <b>are distinct,</b> i.e., they are less severe offenses that entail a less serious punishment. Therefore, it is possible that this great tragedy will result only if one performs all of them."

        [
            "The Gemara explains: <b>Is it written: And they break all bounds,</b> with the conjunction: And, which would indicate that all the sins are included as one unit? Rather, it <b>is written: “They break all bounds,”</b> from which it may be inferred that this punishment is given separately for each one of these sins.",
            "§ <b>They then sat and said</b> additional statements in the name of Rav Asi, one of which concerned <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kinnim</i> 2:5): With regard to <b>a woman</b> after childbirth <b>who brought her sin-offering</b> for her ritual purification <b>and died, the heirs bring her burnt-offering</b> to fulfill her remaining sacrificial obligations. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: And</b> this <b>is</b> the <i>halakha</i> only <b>when</b> the woman herself had already <b>separated,</b> i.e., designated, the animal for the burnt-offering <b>in her lifetime. But</b> if she <b>had not separated it in her lifetime, no,</b> the heirs are not required to bring a burnt-offering on her behalf.",
            "The Gemara concludes: <b>Apparently,</b> Shmuel <b>maintains</b> that the property of a debtor is <b>not liened by Torah law.</b> In other words, one does not say that because she was required to bring a burnt-offering there is a lien on her property and the debt must be paid even if she did not set aside the animal before her death. <b>Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even though she did not separate</b> the burnt-offering <b>in her lifetime. Apparently,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>maintains</b> that the property of a debtor is <b>liened by Torah law.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> these Sages already <b>disagreed about</b> this issue <b>once;</b> why would they engage in the same dispute with regard to multiple applications? <b>As Rav and Shmuel both say:</b> With regard to <b>a loan</b> granted <b>by oral</b> agreement, i.e., without a document that places a lien on the land, if the debtor dies, the creditor <b>cannot collect</b> the loan <b>from the heirs or from those who purchased</b> the land. This is the <i>halakha</i> even if it is clear that there was a loan and the debtors do not dispute this fact. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish both say:</b> With regard to <b>a loan by oral</b> agreement, the creditor can <b>collect from the heirs and from those who purchased</b> from the debtor. This shows that those same Sages already disagreed as to whether a lien on a property exists by Torah law in the absence of a document.",
            "The Gemara answers: It is <b>necessary</b> to teach both cases <b>as, if</b> it <b>were stated</b> only <b>about this</b> case of a loan, one might say: It is only <b>with regard to this</b> situation <b>that Shmuel says</b> there is no lien on property, <b>because it is a loan that is not written in the Torah.</b> This loan is merely a private agreement between two individuals. <b>But with regard to this</b> obligation of a woman to bring a burnt-offering, one might <b>say</b> that <b>he concedes to Rabbi Yoḥanan and to Reish Lakish.</b> Since this woman’s obligation to bring a burnt-offering is written in the Torah, perhaps it creates a lien on her property despite the fact that there is no document to that effect.",
            "<b>And</b> conversely, <b>had</b> the <i>amora’im</i> <b>taught us about</b> their dispute only in <b>this</b> case of the burnt-offering of a woman following childbirth, one might say that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that the Torah imposes a lien only in <b>this</b> case of the burnt-offering, as <b>a loan written in the Torah is like one written in a document. But with regard to this</b> private loan, one might <b>say</b> that <b>he concedes to Shmuel</b> that the lien does not apply by Torah law. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> to state the dispute in both cases.",
            "<b>Rav Pappa said</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is as follows: With regard to <b>a loan by oral</b> agreement, the creditor can <b>collect from the heirs but he cannot collect from those who purchased</b> from the debtor. The reason <b>he can collect from the heirs</b> is that the accepted opinion is that the property of a debtor is <b>liened by Torah law. But he cannot collect from those who purchased</b> from the debtor, because a loan by oral agreement <b>does not generate publicity,</b> i.e., people will not have heard about it. Therefore, they are not careful to avoid buying property from the debtor. These purchasers should not suffer due to a lien that was not well known.",
            "§ The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> a woman <b>acquires herself through a bill of divorce or through the death of the husband.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a bill of divorce, as it is written</b> explicitly in the Torah: <b>“And he writes for her a scroll of severance,</b> and gives it in her hand, and sends her out of his house; and she departs out of his house and she goes and becomes another man’s wife” (Deuteronomy 24:1–2). This indicates that a bill of divorce enables a woman to marry whomever she wishes after the divorce.",
            "<b>But from where do we</b> derive that <b>the death of the husband</b> also enables a woman to remarry? The Gemara answers: This <b>is</b> based on <b>logical reasoning: He,</b> the husband, <b>rendered her forbidden</b> to every man, <b>and he</b> has <b>permitted her.</b> Since the husband is no longer alive, there is no one who renders her forbidden.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> consider the status of <b>those with whom relations are forbidden, as he renders</b> her <b>forbidden to them, and</b> yet he <b>does not permit</b> her <b>to them</b> when he dies. For example, one may not marry one’s father’s wife even after the father dies. <b>Rather, from</b> the fact <b>that the Merciful One states</b> that <b>a <i>yevama</i> who does not have children</b> from her deceased husband <b>is prohibited</b> from marrying anyone besides the <i>yavam</i>, it may be inferred that a widow <b>who has children</b> from her deceased husband <b>is permitted</b> to remarry.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps</b> one should infer the following from that <i>halakha</i>: A woman who <b>does not have children</b> from her deceased husband <b>is forbidden to everyone and permitted to the <i>yavam</i>, and</b> a woman who <b>has children</b> from her deceased husband <b>is forbidden to everyone also. Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> that the death of the husband permits a woman to marry another man is derived <b>from</b> the fact that <b>the Merciful One states</b> that <b>a widow is forbidden to a High Priest.</b> This indicates that it is <b>permitted</b> for her <b>to</b> marry <b>a common priest,</b> and the same certainly applies to a non-priest.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps</b> one can say that she is forbidden <b>to a High Priest by a prohibition,</b> whereas she is forbidden <b>to everyone else</b> only <b>by</b> dint of <b>a positive mitzva.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>This positive mitzva, what is its purpose? If the death of the husband affects</b> her status, <b>she should be entirely permitted,</b> and <b>if the death of the husband does not affect</b> her status <b>she remains in her initial state</b> when her husband was alive, and therefore those who engage in sexual intercourse with her would be liable to receive the death penalty.",
            "The Gemara answers: And <b>why</b> is this suggestion <b>not</b> considered reasonable? One could argue that the death of the husband <b>removed her from</b> the class of people with whom one is punished with <b>death</b> for engaging in intercourse, <b>and placed her in</b> the class of people with whom one is prohibited to engage in intercourse due to <b>a positive mitzva, just as it is with consecrated</b> animals <b>that have been disqualified.</b> This is referring to animals that were designated as offerings but became invalid due to some blemish.",
            "The Gemara explains: The <i>halakha</i> with regard to such animals is <b>that initially,</b> when they are unblemished, <b>they are subject</b> to the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>misuse,</b> i.e., if one benefited from them he has misused consecrated items. <b>And</b> likewise <b>shearing</b> them and performing <b>labor</b> with them <b>is prohibited.</b> Once these animals have developed a blemish and <b>one has redeemed them,</b> the prohibition against <b>misuse</b> of consecrated items <b>does not apply to them,</b> but <b>shearing</b> them and performing <b>labor</b> with them remains <b>prohibited.</b> Based on this example, it is possible that the death of the husband does not render the woman entirely permitted. If so, one cannot derive from here that it is permitted for a wife whose husband has passed away to marry another man.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the source that a widow may remarry is <b>from that</b> which <b>the verse states: “Lest he die in battle and another man take her”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:7). This indicates that a man may marry a widow. <b>Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, objects to this:</b> One can <b>say: Who is</b> this <b>other</b> man mentioned by the verse?

Therefore, <b>the verse states “by any of these,”</b> to emphasize that one sold to a gentile <b>can be redeemed</b> only <b>through these</b> relatives, <b>and he cannot be redeemed after six</b> years.",
            "The Gemara explains the proof: <b>And if it enters your mind that</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>derives</b> the verbal analogy between <b>“hired worker”</b> and <b>“hired worker,” why</b> does he <b>say: If one who cannot be redeemed by these,</b> with regard to one who is sold to a Jew? <b>Let him derive</b> that <i>halakha</i> from the case of one sold to a gentile, through the verbal analogy between <b>“hired worker”</b> and <b>“hired worker.”</b> The term “hired worker” is used in reference to one sold to a gentile as well: “As a hired worker year by year he shall be with him” (Leviticus 25:53), and accordingly one can say that even one sold to a Jew can be redeemed by his relatives. The fact that he does not accept this claim indicates that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi rejects the verbal analogy between “hired worker” and “hired worker.”",
            "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> This proof can be refuted, as one can say that <b>actually</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>does derive</b> the verbal analogy between <b>“hired worker”</b> and <b>“hired worker,” and it is different here,</b> with regard to one sold to a gentile, <b>as the verse states:</b> “Either his uncle or his uncle’s son <b>may redeem him”</b> (Leviticus 25:49). This emphasis of “him” teaches that redemption is an option only <b>for this</b> slave <b>and not for another</b> type of slave.",
            "With regard to the dispute itself the Gemara inquires: <b>And who is the <i>tanna</i></b> who <b>disagrees with Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi with regard to this? It is <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili and Rabbi Akiva. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning the verse: “And if <b>he is not redeemed by any of these”</b> (Leviticus 25:54), that <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says:</b> The expression <b>“by any of these”</b> indicates that redemption by one’s relatives is <b>to freedom,</b> i.e., one becomes an entirely free man. But if a slave is redeemed <b>by anyone else</b> who pays the gentile master, it is <b>to slavery.</b> The redeemed slave becomes indentured to his redeemer until he repays the cost of his redemption through his work. <b>Rabbi Akiva says</b> the opposite: <b>By these</b> relatives he is redeemed <b>to slavery,</b> whereas if he is redeemed <b>by anyone else,</b> it is <b>to freedom.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili? The verse states</b> concerning a redeemed slave who is emancipated: <b>“If he is not redeemed by any of these”</b> relatives; <b>but</b> if he is redeemed <b>by another, “then he shall go out in the Jubilee Year,”</b> not earlier, as he becomes enslaved to him. <b>And Rabbi Akiva says: “If he is not redeemed”</b> in any other manner but <b>only “by any of these,” “then he shall go out in the Jubilee Year,”</b> i.e., if he is redeemed by relatives, he is emancipated only at the close of Yom Kippur of the Jubilee Year. By contrast, if he is redeemed by others he is emancipated immediately. <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili</b> respond to this claim? He would ask: <b>Is it written: Only by any of these?</b>",
            "<b>Rather,</b> as this suggested interpretation of the verse by Rabbi Akiva is clearly problematic, the Gemara retracts the previous explanation of the dispute and instead says that <b>they disagree with regard to</b> the precise meaning of <b>this verse:</b> “Either his uncle or his uncle’s son may redeem him, or any that is near of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he becomes rich, and he is redeemed” (Leviticus 25:49). <b>“Either his uncle or his uncle’s son may redeem him”; this is the redemption</b> performed <b>by relatives. “Or if he becomes rich”</b>; <b>this is redemption</b> by <b>himself. “And he is redeemed”; this is redemption by other</b> people.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili maintains: A verse is interpreted homiletically</b> based on its juxtaposition to the verse immediately <b>preceding it.</b> Therefore, one should <b>cast,</b> i.e., compare, the case of <b>redemption</b> performed <b>by relatives to</b> the case of <b>redemption</b> performed <b>by himself: Just as redemption</b> performed <b>by himself</b> leads <b>to</b> complete <b>freedom, so too, redemption</b> performed <b>by relatives</b> leads <b>to freedom.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> that this is their dispute, <b>why do I</b> need the phrase <b>“by any of these,”</b> according to both Rabbi Yosei HaGelili and Rabbi Akiva? The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> it were <b>not</b> for the phrase <b>“by any of these,” I would say</b> that <b>a verse is interpreted homiletically</b> based on its juxtaposition to the verse immediately <b>preceding it as well as</b> to the verse immediately <b>after it, and</b> therefore in <b>every</b> manner in which he is redeemed it is <b>to freedom.</b> The phrase “by any of these” limits this freedom either to relatives or other people, according to the respective opinions of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili and Rabbi Akiva.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> that the different opinions are based on the phrase “by any of these,” then <b>the difficulty</b> with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, that the verse does not say: If he is not redeemed in any other manner but only by any of these, <b>has returned to its place,</b> i.e., it is still valid, as this phrase indicates that Rabbi Yosei HaGelili’s interpretation of the verse is correct. <b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Yosei HaGelili and Rabbi Akiva <b>disagree with regard to reason.</b> Their dispute is a matter of logic and does not concern textual interpretation.",
            "The Gemara elaborates. <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili maintains: It stands to reason</b> that <b>redemption</b> performed <b>by others</b> is <b>to slavery, as, if you say</b> it is <b>to freedom, they will refrain and will not redeem him.</b> If the slave is required to serve them, and they incur no financial loss, they will redeem him. <b>And Rabbi Akiva maintains: It stands to reason</b> that <b>redemption</b> performed <b>by relatives</b> is <b>to slavery, as, if you say</b> it is <b>to freedom, each and every day he will go and sell himself</b> over and again, relying on his relatives to free him.",
            "<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This is the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili and Rabbi Akiva,</b> who hold that a slave is not invariably freed whenever he is redeemed from his gentile master. <b>But the Rabbis say</b> that in <b>every</b> case, when he is emancipated it is <b>to freedom.</b>",
            "The Gemara inquires: <b>Who</b> are these <b>Rabbis?</b> It is <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who derives another exposition from this</b> term <b>“by any of these,”</b> as stated above. <b>And</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi maintains that <b>a verse is interpreted homiletically</b> based on its juxtaposition to the verse immediately <b>preceding it as well as</b> to the verse immediately <b>after it.</b> Consequently, the Hebrew slave of a gentile is emancipated regardless of whether he is redeemed by relatives or other people.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>what does he do with</b> the verse: “And if he is not redeemed by any of these means, <b>then he shall go out in the Jubilee Year”</b> (Leviticus 25:54)? The Gemara answers: <b>He requires</b> this verse <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“Then he shall go out in the Jubilee Year.”</b> If the slave is not redeemed prior to this point in time he leaves his gentile master only in the Jubilee Year."

            "§ The mishna teaches: A Hebrew slave can be acquired by his master through money <b>or through a document.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that he can be acquired through a document? <b>Ulla said: The verse states</b> with regard to a Hebrew maidservant: <b>“If he takes himself another wife”</b> (Exodus 21:10). <b>The verse</b> thereby <b>juxtaposes</b> a Hebrew maidservant <b>to another</b> woman who is betrothed: <b>Just as another</b> woman <b>can be acquired</b> by her husband <b>through a document</b> (see 2a), <b>so too, a Hebrew maidservant can be acquired through a document.</b>",

            "<b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is derived from a different source. <b>The verse states</b> with regard to a Hebrew maidservant: <b>“She shall not go out as the men slaves do”</b> (Exodus 21:7).

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that the inference should be a different one: <b>But she can be acquired in</b> the manner of <b>the acquisition of</b> Canaanite <b>male slaves, and what is</b> this mode of acquisition? It is <b>possession.</b> The Gemara answers that one cannot interpret that verse in this manner, as <b>the verse states</b> with regard to Canaanite slaves: <b>“And you shall bequeath them to your children after you”</b> (Leviticus 25:46), which indicates that you can acquire only <b>them,</b> i.e., Canaanite slaves, <b>through possession,</b> like an inherited tract of land, <b>but other</b> slaves <b>cannot</b> be acquired <b>through possession.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, one can equally <b>say</b> that <b>they,</b> Canaanite slaves, can be acquired <b>through a document, but others cannot</b> be acquired <b>through a document.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Isn’t it written: “She shall not go out as the men slaves do”</b> (Exodus 21:7), and this is explained to mean that she, like other slaves, can be acquired through a document. The Gemara asks: Since these two verses can be explained in either manner, <b>what did you see</b> that led you to compare a Hebrew maidservant to a Canaanite slave with regard to a document, and what led you to differentiate her from a Canaanite slave with regard to acquisition through possession? Perhaps the opposite should be the case, i.e., she is similar to a Canaanite slave with regard to possession and differs from him concerning acquisition through a document?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>It stands to reason</b> that <b>a document should be included</b> in the acquisition of a slave, <b>as</b> a document is powerful in that it can <b>release a Jewish woman,</b> in the form of a bill of divorce. The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>On the contrary, possession should be included, as it can effect acquisition</b> in the case <b>of the property of a convert</b> who died without leaving heirs, whereas no other mode can be used to acquire such property. The Gemara answers: Nevertheless, <b>with regard to marriage, in any event, one does not find</b> acquisition by means of possession. <b>If you wish, say</b> another answer: It is <b>to that end,</b> i.e., to determine in which way to compare a Hebrew maidservant to a Canaanite slave, that the verse <b>“if</b> he takes <b>another,” is effective,</b> as it indicates that the acquisition of a Hebrew maidservant includes a mode of acquisition used in betrothal, i.e., a document.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And Rav Huna, what does he learn from this</b> verse: <b>“She shall not go out as the men slaves do”</b> (Exodus 21:7)?

            "§ The mishna further states that a Hebrew slave is emancipated <b>in the Jubilee</b> Year. The Gemara explains that this is <b>as it is written: “He shall labor with you until the Jubilee Year”</b> (Leviticus 25:40).",
            "§ The mishna teaches that a Hebrew slave can be freed <b>through the deduction of money.

The Sages expounded that the term <b>“man”</b> serves <b>to exclude a minor</b> who commits adultery. The phrase <b>“who commits adultery with the wife of another man”</b> serves <b>to exclude the wife of a minor,</b> as the marriage of a minor is invalid. <b>And if you say</b> that a father can <b>designate</b> a wife for his minor son, and designation effects betrothal or marriage, <b>we find</b> that there is <b>marriage for a minor.</b>",

By comparing this case to the case of the parable, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, would hold that the designation does not take effect even if the master had said at the time of the acquisition that designation should take effect in thirty days, provided that her father betroths her to another in the interim.",

            "<b>Rather,</b> it <b>is obvious</b> that this slave was freed <b>with his consent, and</b> the mishna <b>teaches us this:</b> With money given <b>by others, yes,</b> the slave can be freed in this manner, but <b>by</b> giving money <b>himself, no,</b> he cannot be freed in this manner, despite his consent. <b>Evidently, a slave has no acquisition without his master.</b> It is impossible for a slave to perform an independent act of acquisition, as everything acquired by him immediately belongs to his master. Consequently, he cannot be in possession of money with which he can acquire himself. Instead, the money must be given to his owner by somebody else.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so, say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: He can be freed <b>by</b> means of <b>a bill</b> of manumission if he accepts it <b>by himself.</b> The Gemara analyzes this ruling: If he accepts it <b>by himself, yes,</b> but if it is accepted <b>by others, no,</b> he cannot acquire his freedom in this manner. <b>And if</b> this document is produced <b>with</b> the slave’s <b>consent,</b> as claimed above, <b>why</b> is it <b>not</b> effective if it is accepted <b>by others?</b>",
            "The Gemara adds: <b>And if you would say</b> in response: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: If he accepts it <b>by himself?</b> This means that in addition to being freed if the bill of manumission is accepted by others, <b>he can also</b> be freed if he accepts it <b>by himself, and</b> according to <b>this</b> interpretation the mishna <b>teaches us this,</b> that <b>his bill</b> of manumission <b>and his ability</b> to acquire himself <b>come simultaneously.</b> In other words, although he did not have the legal power to acquire himself while he was still a slave, when he receives his bill of manumission he attains this ability at that same moment. The Gemara explains why this interpretation of the mishna is problematic: <b>But</b> Rabbi Meir <b>did not teach this</b> ruling, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A slave can be freed <b>by</b> means of <b>a bill</b> of manumission if he accepts it <b>by himself, but not</b> if it is accepted <b>by others;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>",
            "<b>Abaye said: Actually,</b> according to Rabbi Meir the mishna is referring to a case where the master received money <b>without</b> the slave’s <b>consent, and</b> acquisition effected with the giving of <b>money is different: Since it acquires him against his will</b> from another master, as the slave’s consent is not necessary in that case, it likewise <b>acquires him for himself against his will.</b> His consent is not required, despite the fact that it is against his interest to be freed.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> that the <i>halakha</i> that a slave can be freed with the giving of money without his consent is predicated on the <i>halakha</i> that he can be acquired by means of the giving of money to his previous master without his consent, he should <b>also</b> be freed with <b>a document</b> if it is accepted by others without his consent. The Gemara answers: <b>This document is discrete, and this document is discrete,</b> i.e., the comparison between the acquisition of a slave and his emancipation is invalid in the case of a document, as a document of sale is not similar to a bill of manumission.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Here too, this money is discrete and this money is discrete,</b> as the money is given for a different purpose in the cases of acquisition and manumission. The Gemara answers: <b>In any event, the coin</b> itself <b>is one,</b> i.e., there is no noticeable difference between the coin used for acquisition of a slave and one that would be used for emancipating him. The same cannot be said with regard to documents, as particular texts serve specific purposes, and the same document could not be used for both acquiring a slave and emancipating him.",
            "<b>Rava said</b> the following distinction: With regard to emancipation by means of <b>money, his master’s receipt</b> of the money <b>causes him</b> to be freed, not the giving of the money by others. Therefore, they are not considered to have harmed the slave without his consent. By contrast, in the case of <b>a document,</b> the <b>receipt</b> of the document <b>by others</b> on behalf of the slave <b>causes him</b> to be freed, and one can incur liability for another person only in his presence.",
            "§ The mishna teaches: <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The slave can be freed <b>by</b> means of <b>money</b> given <b>by himself.</b> The Gemara analyzes this ruling: <b>By</b> means of <b>money</b> given <b>by himself, yes,</b> he can be emancipated in this manner, but with money given <b>by others, no,</b> he cannot be emancipated in this manner.

            "<b>And if you would say: What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>By</b> means of <b>money</b> given <b>by himself?</b> This means that not only can he be redeemed by means of money given to others but he can be redeemed <b>even by</b> means of money given to <b>himself, and it teaches us that a slave has</b> the ability to receive <b>an acquisition without his master.

            "<b>Rather,</b> it is clear that there is a difference between money and a document.

Therefore, he can be freed by means of a document only through other people who receive the document on his behalf.",
            "<b>Rabba raises a dilemma:</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar,</b> in the case of <b>a Canaanite slave, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the possibility <b>that</b> a slave <b>can appoint an agent to accept his bill</b> of manumission <b>from the hand of his master?</b> Does one say that <b>since</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar <b>derives</b> the verbal analogy of <b>“<i>lah</i>”</b> and <b>“<i>lah</i>” from a woman,</b> which teaches that a slave can be freed with a document, therefore, a slave is also <b>like a woman</b> in that he too can appoint an agent?",
            "<b>Or perhaps,</b> in the case of <b>a woman, as she can accept her bill of divorce</b> herself, <b>she can also appoint an agent,</b> whereas <b>a slave</b> is different, <b>as he cannot accept his bill</b> of manumission himself, and consequently <b>he cannot appoint an agent either.

            "The Gemara comments: <b>But</b> consider <b>that which Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, says</b> with regard to the service in the Temple: <b>These priests are the agents of the Merciful One,</b> i.e., they perform the Temple service as the emissaries of God. <b>As if it enters your mind</b> that <b>they are our agents, is there anything that we cannot do but</b> agents <b>can do</b> on our behalf?

            "This statement leads to the following question: <b>But</b> is it <b>not</b> true that an agent can be appointed to perform a task that cannot be done by the one who sent him? <b>But</b> according to Rava’s conclusion there is the case of <b>a slave, who is unable to accept his bill</b> of manumission <b>himself, and</b> yet <b>he can appoint an agent</b> to receive it for him.",
            "The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>And</b> that <b>is not so.</b> The difference between the cases is that <b>an Israelite is not involved in the <i>halakhot</i> of offerings at all,</b> as a non-priest is never permitted to sacrifice offerings. By contrast, <b>a slave is</b> somewhat <b>involved in bills</b> of manumission, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>It seems that a slave can accept the bill</b> of manumission <b>of another</b> slave <b>from the hand of the master of</b> that <b>other</b> slave. <b>But</b> he <b>cannot</b> accept a bill of manumission <b>from the hand of his own master,</b> who wishes to free another of his slaves. In this case there is no acquisition, as the document has not left the master’s property, as anything given to a slave is considered the property of his master. With regard to the issue at hand, since a slave can accept a bill of manumission, at least on behalf of another slave, the <i>halakhot</i> of these documents are relevant to him, and therefore he can appoint an agent to receive his bill of manumission.",

The <i>halakha</i> of unaffected skin does not apply to the extremities because the priest must be able to see the entirety of the untainted area at once. Due to the shape of the twenty-four extremities, it is impossible to see the entirety of the area from a single vantage point. Consequently, the <i>halakha</i> of unaffected skin does not apply to them.",

A Sage from <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> a different proof: <b>“And you shall possess it and dwell there”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:31). <b>How have you possessed</b> it? You have done so <b>by dwelling</b> there. This teaches that land can be acquired through an act that demonstrates ownership.",

This verse speaks of <b>an item that is acquired from hand to hand,</b> i.e., by pulling.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, who says</b> that <b>by Torah law</b> giving <b>money effects acquisition</b> but pulling does not, <b>what can be said?</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan maintains that acquisition through pulling is a rabbinic decree, and by Torah law movable property can be acquired only by means of giving money. Why does the mishna not mention this mode of acquisition? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yoḥanan could answer that the <b><i>tanna</i> teaches a rabbinic ordinance,</b> which reflects the accepted practice, but he does not find it necessary to mention a mode of acquisition that applies by Torah law.",
            "§ The mishna further states that <b>property that does not serve as a guarantee,</b> i.e., movable property, can be acquired along with property that serves as a guarantee, i.e., land.

The Gemara answers: They hold <b>in accordance with that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, says in the name of Rabbi Yosei ben Durmaska, who said in the name of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, who said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer the Great:</b> The prohibition of <b><i>orla</i></b> does <b>not</b> apply <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael.",
            "The Gemara expresses surprise at this ruling: <b>But</b> does it <b>not</b> apply? Does Rabbi Eliezer maintain that the prohibition of <i>orla</i> does not apply outside of Eretz Yisrael? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Even</b> the <b>new crop,</b> which indicates that he agrees that <i>orla</i> and diverse kinds are forbidden outside of Eretz Yisrael? The Gemara answers that one should not <b>teach</b> that Rabbi Eliezer said: Even the new crop, but rather teach only the words: The <b>new crop,</b> i.e., Rabbi Eliezer maintains that only this prohibition applies outside of Eretz Yisrael.",
            "<b>Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: <i>Orla</i></b> is forbidden <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael by <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai. Rabbi Zeira said to Rabbi Asi: But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to produce whose status concerning <b><i>orla</i></b> is <b>uncertain, in Eretz</b> Yisrael it is <b>forbidden, in Syria</b> it is <b>permitted,</b> and <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>one goes down and gathers</b> it? And if <i>orla</i> is forbidden outside of Eretz Yisrael by a <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai, why is produce whose status concerning <i>orla</i> is uncertain permitted in Syria? Rabbi Zeira <b>“was dismayed for a while”</b> (Daniel 4:16), and then Rabbi Asi <b>said to him: Say</b> that <b>it is stated like this,</b> i.e., explain that the <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai was that outside of Eretz Yisrael produce whose status concerning <i>orla</i> is <b>uncertain</b> is <b>permitted, and</b> produce whose status concerning <i>orla</i> is <b>certain</b> is <b>forbidden.</b>",
            "§ <b>Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> Offenders <b>are flogged for</b> transgressing the prohibition of <b>diverse kinds</b> outside of Eretz Yisrael <b>by Torah law. Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, said to him: But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna (<i>Orla</i> 3:9) that the prohibition of <b>diverse kinds</b> applies <b>by rabbinic law</b> outside of Eretz Yisrael? The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult.</b> The mishna <b>here</b> is referring <b>to diverse kinds in a vineyard,</b> which is prohibited outside of Eretz Yisrael by rabbinic law, whereas <b>there,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement is referring <b>to</b> the <b>grafting of a tree</b> onto a different species.",
            "The Gemara adds that this <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel. As Shmuel says:</b> The verse states: <b>“You shall keep My statutes”</b> (Leviticus 19:19), which means that one must keep even the <b>statutes that I have already instituted for you</b> when you were merely descendants of Noah, before the giving of the Torah. Shmuel elaborates: This is referring to the prohibitions stated in that same verse: <b>“You shall not let your cattle gender with a diverse kind; you shall not sow your field</b> with two kinds of seed” (Leviticus 19:19).",
            "Additionally, the juxtaposition of these prohibitions teaches that <b>just as</b> the prohibition of diverse kinds stated with regard to <b>your animal</b> applies only <b>to mating</b> one species with another, <b>so too,</b> the prohibition of diverse kinds with regard to <b>your field</b> is referring only <b>to grafting</b> one type of tree to another type, and it does not apply to planting two species together. Furthermore, <b>just as</b> the prohibition of diverse kinds with regard to <b>your animal applies both in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, as this prohibition does not relate to the land, <b>so too,</b> the prohibition against grafting <b>your field applies both in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “Your field,”</b> which indicates that the field belongs to you in your portion of Eretz Yisrael? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse serves <b>to exclude</b> the prohibition of diverse kinds of <b>seeds,</b> which does not apply <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael. Planting different types of seeds together is prohibited only in Eretz Yisrael.",
            "§ The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Ḥanan and Rav Anan were</b> once <b>going</b> together <b>on a road</b> outside of Eretz Yisrael and <b>they saw a certain man planting seeds</b> of diverse kinds <b>together.</b> One of them <b>said to</b> the other: <b>Let the Master come</b> and <b>ostracize him,</b> as he is performing a prohibited act.

            "<b>And furthermore, they</b> also <b>saw a certain man who was planting wheat and barley between grapevines.</b> One of them <b>said to</b> the other: <b>Let the Master come</b> and <b>ostracize him. He</b> again <b>said to him:</b> These <i>halakhot</i> are <b>not clear to you.</b> He explained: <b>Don’t we hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoshiya, who says:</b> One who sows diverse kinds is not liable by Torah law <b>until he sows wheat, and barley, and</b> a grape <b>seed with a single hand motion,</b> i.e., by sowing in the vineyard he violates the prohibition of diverse kinds that applies to seeds and to the vineyard simultaneously. Since this man was not planting in that manner, he should not be ostracized.",
            "The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Yosef</b> was <b>mixing</b> diverse <b>seeds and planting</b> them. <b>Abaye said to him: But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that mixing <b>diverse kinds</b> is prohibited outside of Eretz Yisrael <b>by rabbinic law?</b> Rav Yosef <b>said to him:</b> This is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>here,</b> the mishna is referring <b>to diverse kinds in a vineyard,</b> and <b>there,</b> I am planting legally because I am planting only <b>diverse kinds of seeds.</b> The reason for the difference between these two cases is as follows: With regard to planting <b>diverse kinds in a vineyard, which in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>is prohibited</b> even <b>with regard to</b> deriving <b>benefit, the Sages issued a decree</b> prohibiting this mixture <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael as well. Conversely, with regard to planting <b>diverse kinds of seeds, which in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>is not prohibited with regard to</b> deriving <b>benefit, the Sages did not issue a decree</b> prohibiting <b>them outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael.",
            "<b>Rav Yosef then said: The matter that I said,</b> i.e., that diverse kinds of seeds are entirely permitted outside of Eretz Yisrael, <b>is not</b> so. The proof is that <b>Rav planted the garden</b> around <b>the study hall in rows [<i>mesharei</i>]</b> of different species. <b>What is the reason</b> that he did that rather than plant different species together? Is it <b>not because</b> he was concerned about <b>mixtures of diverse kinds? Abaye said to him:</b> That is not proof. <b>Granted, if he taught us</b> this <i>halakha</i> through his actions,"

            "and he was careful to plant <b>four</b> different species <b>along the four sides of the garden bed and one in the middle,</b> so that there would be space between them, it works out <b>well.</b> This would show that Rav was cautious not to plant diverse kinds together. <b>But here,</b> where Rav actually planted each species in its own bed, he did so <b>due to beautification,</b> i.e., to improve the appearance of the garden in front of the study hall. <b>Alternatively,</b> the reason Rav planted this way <b>is due to the trouble</b> that would be caused to <b>the attendant.</b> When his attendant would be sent to fetch a certain type of vegetable from the garden he would not need to search for it, but would know where the different vegetables were planted. Therefore, this does not prove that Rav was concerned about diverse kinds outside of Eretz Yisrael.",

            "The Gemara further asks: <b>And</b> does <b>anyone who performs one mitzva in addition to his</b> other <b>merits have goodness bestowed upon him</b> in this world?

            "<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Ya’akov says: There is not a single mitzva written in the Torah whose reward</b> is stated <b>alongside it, which is not dependent on the resurrection of the dead,</b> i.e., the reward is actually bestowed in the World-to-Come, after the resurrection of the dead. How so? <b>With regard to honoring one’s father and mother it is written: “That your days may be long, and that it may go well with you”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:16). <b>With regard to</b> the <b>dispatch</b> of the mother bird from <b>the nest it is written: “That it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:7).",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps this</b> incident <b>never occurred?</b> It is possible that everyone who performs these mitzvot is rewarded in this world, and the situation described by Rabbi Ya’akov never happened.

            "§ With regard to the mishna in <i>Pe’a</i>, the Gemara states: An act of <b>merit has a principal</b> reward <b>and it has profits,</b> i.e., one receives additional reward beyond that which is granted for the mitzva itself, parallel to a principal sum and profits, <b>as it is stated: “Say you of the righteous who is good,</b> that they shall eat the fruit of their actions” (Isaiah 3:10). <b>A sin has a principal</b> penalty <b>but it has no profits,</b> i.e., no punishment beyond that, <b>as it is stated: “Woe to the evil wicked one,</b> for the work of his hands shall be done to him” (Isaiah 3:11), but no more than the work of his hands.",

The Gemara answers that this applies to <b>a sin that produces profits,</b> i.e., a case where there are practical consequences to one’s sin. For example, if others learn to act in a similar manner, one’s actions <b>have profits</b> with regard to punishment as well. Conversely, a sin <b>that does not produce profits does not have profits</b> as a punishment either.",

            "<b>And</b> if there is a prohibition against a man betrothing a women by means of an agent, then <b>when</b> the statement of <b>Rav Yosef was stated,</b> that it is merely preferable that the betrothal be performed without an agent, <b>it was stated with regard to the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>A woman can become betrothed by herself or by</b> means of <b>her agent.

            "The Gemara answers: It <b>was necessary</b> to state this additional term, as it might <b>enter your mind to say: Since the Master says</b> that the word “you” is interpreted as a limitation, it means that <b>“you,” but not sharecroppers,</b> can separate <i>teruma</i>, as a sharecropper cannot separate <i>teruma</i> from the produce of the owner of the field; <b>“you”</b> can separate <i>teruma</i> <b>but not partners</b> from shared property without the consent of the other; <b>“you”</b> can separate <i>teruma</i> <b>but not a steward [<i>apotropos</i>]</b> from the estate that he is administering; and <b>“you”</b> can separate <i>teruma</i> <b>but not one who separates</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>from</b> produce <b>that is not his,</b> you might <b>also say: “You”</b> can separate <i>teruma</i> <b>and not your agents.</b> The verse therefore <b>teaches us</b> that “you also” indicates that one can appoint an agent to separate <i>teruma</i>.",
            "The Gemara poses a question with regard to the basic derivation of the <i>halakha</i> of agency: <b>This works out well</b> according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa,</b> who explains that the verse: “And the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall slaughter it in the afternoon” (Exodus 12:6), teaches the <i>halakha</i> of agency with regard to offerings. <b>But</b> according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yonatan, who derives a different exposition from this verse, from where do we</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> of agency with regard to offerings? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: From where do we</b> derive that <b>all of the Jews can fulfill</b> their obligations"

            "<b>with one Paschal offering?</b> Although it is impossible for all of the Jewish people to each eat an olive-bulk from one offering, they nevertheless fulfill their obligation to sacrifice the Paschal offering by sacrificing one animal, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the Paschal offering: <b>“And the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall slaughter it in the afternoon”</b> (Exodus 12:6). <b>Is it so that the whole assembly slaughters</b> it? <b>But only one</b> person from each group <b>slaughters. Rather,</b> it can be derived <b>from here that all of the Jews can fulfill</b> their obligations <b>with one Paschal</b> offering, despite the fact that not everyone will be able to eat from it. Since Rabbi Yonatan derives from this verse that one offering suffices, <b>from where does he</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> of <b>agency with regard to offerings?</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: He derives it <b>from that</b> very same verse, as it can be seen that one person slaughters the animal on behalf of the rest of the assembly. The Gemara rejects this: <b>But perhaps it is different there, since</b> the one slaughtering the animal <b>has partnership with them</b> in the offering. This does not prove that there is agency when the agent has no share in the offering.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> he derives agency with regard to offerings <b>from here: “And they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to their fathers’ houses, a lamb for a household”</b> (Exodus 12:3).

The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps there too</b> there is agency <b>since</b> the one slaughtering the animal <b>has partnership with them?</b> The Gemara rejects this: <b>If so, why do I</b> need <b>two verses</b> to teach the same <i>halakha</i>? <b>If</b> the <i>halakha</i> stated in this verse <b>is not applicable for where it belongs,</b> i.e., with regard to an agent who is a partner in the offering, <b>apply it to where it does not belong,</b> so that even one who does not have a share in the offering can act as an agent.",

Let us say</b> that <b>there is no agency for transgression.</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: The case of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property <b>is different, as</b> it <b>is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy of <b>“sin”</b> in this case and <b>“sin” from <i>teruma</i>,</b> as the verse states: “And sin through error” (Leviticus 5:15), with regard to misuse of consecrated property, and it states: “Lest they bear sin for it” (Leviticus 22:9) with regard to <i>teruma</i>: <b>Just as</b> with <b><i>teruma</i></b> one can <b>appoint an agent, so too</b> with <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property one can <b>appoint an agent,</b> although the latter is a transgression.",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>And let us derive</b> a principle <b>from</b> misuse of consecrated property, that one can appoint an agent even to perform a transgression.

The Gemara clarifies this statement: The verse pertaining to <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property <b>is that which we said,</b> but <b>what is</b> the verse pertaining to <b>misappropriation?</b>",
            "This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah uses the inclusive term “every” with regard to one suspected of misappropriating a deposit: <b>“For every matter of trespass”</b> (Exodus 22:8). <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> This inclusive term “every” serves <b>to render</b> one <b>liable for</b> speech and <b>thought,</b> i.e., intent to misappropriate, <b>like action.

The Sages then clarified this <i>halakha</i>: <b>And if,</b> before the husband had died, <b>any of</b> those forbidden women <b>had died, or had performed refusal; or had been divorced; or had been found</b> to be <b>a sexually underdeveloped woman [<i>ailonit</i>],</b> who is incapable of bearing children, then <b>her rival wives are permitted</b> to the <i>yavam</i>.",

In that case, the same <i>halakha</i> as that of an orphan applies to her, in that her father does not have the right to betroth her again, although he is still alive. If she then would betroth herself, her betrothal is not effective by Torah law, because she is still a minor.

            "The Gemara asks a question based on a comparison to a similar case: <b>But</b> why must the priest go to the effort of returning the flour to its owner? <b>Let</b> the separated flour <b>be</b> considered <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> i.e., <i>ḥalla</i>, by rabbinic law, <b>and it should not be eaten</b> by the priest <b>until he removes <i>ḥalla</i> for it from somewhere else,</b> in order to make it ready to be eaten. <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 5:10): If one separated <i>teruma</i> <b>from</b> produce grown in <b>a perforated</b> pot, which is obligated in <i>terumot</i> and tithes by Torah law, <b>for</b> produce that had grown in <b>a non-perforated</b> pot, which is not obligated in <i>terumot</i> and tithes according to Torah law; although the separating of <i>teruma</i> did not take effect, and the putative <i>teruma</i> is still untithed produce, it is considered to be <b><i>teruma</i></b> and remains in the possession of the priest, <b>and it may not be eaten until he removes <i>teruma</i> and tithes for it from somewhere else.</b> The same <i>halakha</i> should apply in the case of the <i>ḥalla</i>.",
            "The Gemara answers: With regard to things that are <b>in two</b> separate <b>containers,</b> the priest <b>will listen.</b> Since the priest is well aware of the difference between a perforated and a non-perforated pot, he will accept the ruling of the Sages to separate <i>teruma</i> an additional time. With regard to something that is <b>in one container, he will not listen.</b> He does not see any difference between receiving flour or dough, and he will not accept the ruling of the Sages to separate <i>ḥalla</i> an additional time. Consequently, they required him to return the flour.",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> that the <i>tanna</i> has a different concern: <b>Actually, a priest will listen</b> even with regard to something in a single container, <b>and</b> the concern is that the prior <b>owner</b> of the flour <b>will think</b> that <b>his dough has been made ready</b> to eat <b>and</b> he <b>will come to eat</b> it <b>in</b> its <b>untithed</b> state.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t you say</b> that <b>a person knows that one may not separate <i>ḥalla</i></b> from <b>flour?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He knows</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>but he does not know</b> the reason for the <i>halakha</i>. <b>He knows that one cannot separate <i>ḥalla</i></b> from <b>flour, but he does not know</b> the reason, <b>as he thinks: What</b> is <b>the reason</b> one may not separate <i>ḥalla</i> from flour?

The reason is that <b>when she eats, she eats of her own</b> food. Once she has accepted the dates as money for betrothal, they become her own property and she is betrothed.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava:</b> If one said to a woman: <b>Be betrothed to me with</b> the fruit of <b>an oak tree,</b> i.e., an acorn, <b>with a pomegranate, and with a nut, or if he said to her: Be betrothed to me with these, if combined they are worth one <i>peruta</i>, she is betrothed.

            "The Gemara proceeds to prove Rava’s ruling from the <i>baraita</i>. <b>What are the circumstances</b> in <b>this</b> first case, where he said: <b>With</b> the fruit of <b>an oak tree, with a pomegranate, with a nut? If we say that he said to her: Either with</b> the fruit of <b>an oak tree, or with a pomegranate, or with a nut,</b> why is the <i>halakha</i> that <b>if combined they are worth one <i>peruta</i> she is betrothed? But didn’t he say: Or,</b> which indicates that she is betrothed with only one of them, and that one item should need to be worth one <i>peruta</i>? <b>But rather,</b> if we say that he said to her: <b>With</b> the fruit of <b>an oak tree, and with a pomegranate, and with a nut</b> together, <b>that is</b> the same as saying: <b>With this</b> one, <b>and with this</b> one, <b>and with this</b> one. That <i>halakha</i> is stated in the subsequent clause of the <i>baraita</i>, and would be redundant. <b>Rather, is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where he said to her:</b> Be betrothed to me <b>with these? But from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause teaches: Or if he said to her: Be betrothed to me with these, it may be inferred that</b> in <b>the first clause we are not dealing with</b> a situation where he said: <b>These.</b>",
            "The Gemara continues with the explication of the <i>baraita</i>: Rather, it is to be understood as an initial, general statement, which the <i>tanna</i> <b>is</b> then <b>explaining,</b> as follows: If one says to a woman: <b>Be betrothed to me with</b> the fruit of <b>an oak tree, with a pomegranate, with a nut;</b> the <i>baraita</i> pauses and explains the circumstances of the case: <b>How so? For example, when he</b> gave her these three items and <b>said to her: Be betrothed to me with these.</b>",
            "The Gemara continues with its proof: <b>And the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> a second possibility: If he said to her that she is betrothed: <b>With this</b> one, and she <b>took it and ate it,</b> then <b>if one of them is worth one <i>peruta</i>, she is betrothed. And if not, she is not betrothed.</b>",
            "<b>While</b> in contrast to this, <b>in the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> the <i>tanna</i> <b>does not distinguish between</b> a woman who <b>is eating</b> the items <b>and one who is placing</b> them in her possession. In either case, she is betrothed. You can <b>conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that <b>any</b> case <b>where he said to her: With these,</b> if they were worth one <i>peruta</i> combined, then <b>when she is eating</b> them <b>she is eating of her own</b> food. It is not considered a loan. The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that Rava’s statement is correct.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one,</b> i.e., Rabbi Ami, <b>who says</b> that the case of the woman eating the dates one by one <b>is referring to the latter clause</b> of the mishna, where he said: Be betrothed to me with this and with that, <b>and</b> who explained: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: She is not betrothed <b>unless one of them is worth one <i>peruta</i>? Unless the last one is worth one <i>peruta</i>. So too,</b> the <i>baraita</i> can be explained: <b>Unless the last one is worth one <i>peruta</i>.</b>",
            "<b>But according to Rav and Shmuel, who both say</b> that the case of the woman eating the dates one by one <b>is referring to the first clause</b> of the mishna, how would they explain the statement of the <i>baraita</i>? In the first clause of the mishna, one said: Be betrothed to me with this, be betrothed to me with that, and if one of them is worth one <i>peruta</i> she is betrothed. <b>And</b> Rav and Shmuel explained that <b>it was necessary for</b> the <i>tanna</i> to mention the case of a woman who <b>is eating</b> to teach that despite her immediate benefit, one of the dates must be worth one <i>peruta</i> for her to be betrothed. The phrase: Unless one of them is worth one <i>peruta</i>, indicates that one alone must be worth one <i>peruta</i>. But <b>here</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>lists</b> only <b>groupings;</b> it <b>does not list individual</b> items. The <i>baraita</i> states a case where he said to her: Be betrothed to me, only once, followed by a statement that the three items should serve as the betrothal money. Why, then, does one of them need to be worth one <i>peruta</i>?",
            "The Gemara answers: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>halakha</i> of the <i>baraita</i> taught? <b>It is</b> that of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who says</b> with regard to the laws of <i>piggul</i>, which is an offering that was sacrificed with the intent to consume an olive-bulk of it after its appointed time or outside the boundaries of where it must be consumed: There is <b>no difference</b> whether he says that he intends to consume: <b>An olive-bulk</b> after its time, <b>an olive-bulk</b> outside its boundaries, i.e., without employing the word: And; <b>or</b> whether he said that he intends to consume <b>an olive-bulk</b> after its time <b>and an olive-bulk</b> outside its boundaries, i.e., employing the word: And. Both expressions <b>are</b> considered <b>individual</b> statements, since he is treating each statement separately, and in neither case does he intend to combine the two amounts. According to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, when one says: With this and with this, each statement is distinct. Consequently, although she derives immediate benefit by eating the dates she receives, she is betrothed only if one of them is worth one <i>peruta</i> on its own.",
            "§ <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with a loan, she is not betrothed,</b> since <b>a loan is given to be spent.</b> Consequently, from the moment the money is lent it no longer belongs to the lender, and he cannot betroth a woman with it. The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that this is <b>subject to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with a loan, she is not betrothed, and some say she is betrothed.

            "The Gemara questions this suggestion: <b>And</b> how can <b>you understand</b> it that way? <b>Say the latter clause</b> of that same <i>baraita</i>: <b>And they agree with regard to</b> the case of <b>a sale that he acquires</b> it. Although they disagree as to whether one can betroth a woman with a loan he has given her, they agree that a lender can purchase an item from the debtor in exchange for forgiving the money he has lent him. <b>If you say</b> that <b>a loan is given to be spent, with what has he acquired</b> it?

            "Having enumerated several possibilities for the dispute in the case of a loan with a promissory note, the Gemara explains the dispute in the case of a loan by oral agreement: In the case of one who betroths a woman <b>with a loan</b> by <b>oral</b> agreement, <b>with regard to what do they disagree?</b> They disagree <b>with regard to</b> the statement <b>of Rav Huna,</b> who quoted a statement that <b>Rav says, as Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> If one said to another: <b>I have one hundred dinars in your possession, give it to so-and-so,</b> if he stated this <b>in the presence of</b> all <b>three</b> parties, i.e., the one who had the money, the one who was the owner of the money, and the intended recipient, the intended recipient <b>has acquired</b> it.",

Rava <b>said to him: And should we establish her as a married woman because a marriage contract was established in the marketplace?</b> Since a marriage contract can be written by a man even before betrothal and without the woman’s consent, its existence does not prove that she is married. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about it?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Ashi says: In a place where</b> men first <b>betroth</b> women <b>and afterward write a marriage contract, we are concerned</b> that he had betrothed her; but in a place where <b>they write</b> the marriage contract first <b>and afterward betroth</b> women, <b>we are not concerned.</b>",

Rava said to him: If so,</b> how would you explain <b>this, that it is written</b> at the end of the passage: “Whoever shall do any of these abominations, <b>even the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people”</b> (Leviticus 18:29); <b>if betrothal does not take effect with her,</b> what <b>renders</b> him <b>liable to receive excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>]?</b> If he is not betrothed to either woman, and he engages in intercourse with either one, he is not liable for <i>karet</i>, as this punishment is incurred for this sin only if he engaged in intercourse with the sister of his wife.",
            "<b>Rather, Rava says: The verse</b> is discussing a case where he betrothed them <b>consecutively.</b> He first betrothed one sister and then engaged in intercourse with the other, which accounts for the punishment of <i>karet</i>. <b>And the mishna</b> is to be explained <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabba, as Rabba says: Any</b> matters <b>that cannot</b> be accomplished <b>sequentially cannot be</b> accomplished <b>even</b> if one performs them <b>simultaneously.</b> Here too, since he is unable to betroth the mother and daughter or the two sisters sequentially, his betrothal of both of them simultaneously does not take effect.",

            "In the case of <b>one who increases tithes,</b> i.e., he tithes two-tenths instead of one-tenth of his produce, the remainder of <b>his produce is rendered fit</b> for consumption, as he tithed it properly, <b>but the tithes are ruined,</b> as the additional tithe is neither a tithe nor tithed produce. Since it is unclear which of the two-tenths is the actual tithe and which is not, the entire two-tenths may be treated neither as a tithe nor as tithed produce. <b>But</b> according to Rabba’s opinion, <b>why</b> is this produce rendered fit for consumption? <b>Let us say</b> that <b>any</b> matters <b>that cannot</b> be accomplished <b>sequentially cannot be</b> accomplished <b>even</b> if one performs them <b>simultaneously.</b> Since one cannot designate a tithe of two-tenths sequentially, one-tenth followed by a second tenth, he should be precluded from simultaneously designating two-tenths of his produce as a tithe. Accordingly, it should be considered as though he had not designated any tithe at all, and his produce should not be regarded as tithed.",
            "Rabba <b>said to him:</b> The case of <b>tithe is different, as</b> tithe status <b>takes effect partially,</b> i.e., on less than a unit of produce. <b>As, if one said: Let half</b> of each grain <b>of wheat be designated</b> as tithe, he has <b>designated it.</b> Just as one can designate an entire grain of wheat as a tithe, he can likewise designate a half a grain. In this case too, when one tithes two-tenths of the produce, the ruling is not that one-tenth is the actual tithe and the other tenth is untithed produce. Instead, half of each grain of the designated portion is tithe, while the other half of each grain is not. Accordingly, the remainder of the produce is tithed, as one-tenth of the total has been designated as first tithe. The portion designated as the tithe is ruined, because it is impossible to identify which part of each grain is designated.",
            "The Gemara raises another objection to Rabba’s opinion: <b>But isn’t there</b> the case of <b>animal tithe, which does not take effect partially,</b> as one cannot consecrate half an animal for his tithe. <b>And</b> likewise there is <b>no</b> possibility to separate animals <b>sequentially,</b> as once one has designated one animal as animal tithe he cannot designate another animal for the same purpose. <b>And Rava says:</b> If <b>two</b> animals <b>emerged</b> from the enclosure together <b>as the tenth, and he called them</b> both the <b>tenth,</b> the <b>tenth and eleventh</b> animals <b>are intermingled with each other.</b> One is consecrated with the sanctity of animal tithe while the other remains a peace-offering, but there is no way to determine which is which. The question arises: If the principle that any matters that cannot be accomplished sequentially cannot be accomplished even if one performs them simultaneously is correct, neither animal is consecrated, as one cannot designate both the tenth and the eleventh animals as animal tithe, one after the other.",
            "The Gemara rejects this: <b>Animal tithe is different, as</b> two animals <b>can be</b> designated as animal tithe one after the other <b>in</b> the case of <b>an error.</b> Although one cannot designate the tenth and eleventh animals as the animal tithe <i>ab initio</i>, if he did so in error they are both consecrated. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bekhorot</i> 60a): If one erred and <b>called the ninth</b> animal the <b>tenth,</b> and erred again <b>and</b> called <b>the tenth</b> animal the <b>ninth and the eleventh</b> animal the <b>tenth,</b> all <b>three</b> animals <b>are consecrated.</b> The first is consecrated because it was designated as the tenth, the second because it actually is the tenth, and the third because it was designated as the tenth. Apparently, more than one animal can be consecrated as the animal tithe, if designated in error. In Rava’s example as well, a modicum of sanctity applies to the two animals that emerged together and were together designated as the tenth.",
            "The Gemara raises another objection to Rabba’s principle. <b>There is</b> the case of the forty loaves that accompany <b>a thanks-offering, which are not</b> consecrated if they were designated <b>in error, and are also not</b> consecrated if two sets of loaves were designated for the same offering <b>sequentially. And</b> yet <b>it was stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> disagreed with regard to <b>a thanks-offering that was slaughtered</b> accompanied <b>by eighty loaves,</b> twice the required amount. <b>Ḥizkiyya said: Forty of the eighty</b> loaves <b>are consecrated,</b> even though their identity cannot be determined. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Not</b> even <b>forty of the eighty</b> loaves <b>are consecrated.</b> It would appear that these <i>amora’im</i> disagree with regard to whether or not sanctity that cannot take effect in sequence can take effect simultaneously.",
            "The Gemara rejects this contention: <b>Wasn’t it stated with regard to this</b> dispute that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: All,</b> both Ḥizkiyya and Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>concede</b> that <b>anywhere that</b> the one bringing the thanks-offering <b>said:</b> Let <b>forty of the eighty</b> loaves <b>be consecrated,</b> the forty <b>are consecrated;</b> and in a case where he said: <b>Forty</b> loaves <b>should not be consecrated unless</b> all <b>eighty are consecrated,</b> everyone agrees that <b>they are not consecrated.</b>",
            "<b>They disagree only with regard to</b> a case where the one bringing the thanks-offering designates eighty loaves <b>without specification</b> of how many loaves he wants consecrated. One <b>Sage,</b> Ḥizkiyya, <b>holds:</b> Although he designated eighty loaves, he wants to consecrate only forty, and when he sets aside eighty loaves, <b>he</b> merely <b>intends to ensure</b> that he will have forty. He therefore brought the extra loaves so that if the first forty loaves are lost or become ritually impure the second forty will be consecrated in their place. Consequently, the first forty loaves are consecrated. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>holds:</b> He <b>intends</b> to bring <b>a large offering</b> of eighty loaves, and therefore none of the loaves are consecrated. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi’s explanation of the dispute accords with Rabba’s opinion.",
            "The Gemara turns from its analysis of Rabba’s opinion to the original issue: <b>And why does Rava explain</b> the mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba? Let him derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with a principle of his own, as elsewhere (9a) he establishes that <b>betrothal that is not given to consummation</b> is not betrothal at all, and all of <b>these</b> cases <b>are</b> in this category. Any betrothal in which it is prohibited for the couple to engage in sexual intercourse is not considered betrothal at all. Following this principle, the ruling of the mishna can be explained as follows: Since both women would be forbidden to the man in the event that they were both betrothed to him, as each would be the relative of his betrothed, the betrothals are not given to consummation. Therefore, they do not take effect at all.",
            "The Gemara answers: Rava could have explained the mishna this way, but <b>he stated</b> his explanation <b>in accordance with the statement of Rami bar Ḥama.</b> Rava should be understood as saying: Your opinion that the ruling of the mishna is derived from a verse is incorrect, as the verse is referring only to one who betroths the two sisters or the mother and daughter sequentially. Instead, you should explain the mishna as referring to one who betroths them at the same time, with the reason being that any matters that cannot be accomplished sequentially cannot be accomplished even if one performs them simultaneously.",
            "§ <b>It was stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> had a dispute: With regard to <b>betrothal that is not given to consummation, Abaye says it is betrothal,</b> since the prohibition against engaging in sexual intercourse does not affect the betrothal itself. <b>Rava says: It is not betrothal. Rava says:</b> The Sage <b>bar Ahina explained to me</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is derived from the verse: <b>“When a man takes a woman and engages in sexual intercourse with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), as it indicates that <b>betrothal that is given to</b> permitted <b>consummation is betrothal,</b> whereas <b>betrothal that is not given to consummation is not betrothal.</b>",
            "The Gemara proceeds to analyze these two opinions. <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: In the case of <b>one who betroths a woman and her daughter or a woman and her sister in one</b> act of betrothal <b>neither</b> of them <b>is betrothed.</b> The Gemara analyzes this: <b>But</b> if he said he is betrothing only <b>one of</b> this pair, i.e., <b>the woman or her daughter, or</b> one <b>of</b> that pair, i.e., <b>the woman or her sister,</b> without specifying which of them, <b>she is betrothed.</b> Nevertheless, in practice it is prohibited for him to engage in intercourse with either of them, as it cannot be determined which woman he betrothed and which woman is the relative of his betrothed. <b>But why</b> should the betrothal take effect? <b>These are</b> each <b>a betrothal that is not given to consummation,</b> and should not be valid according to Rava. Shall we say this is <b>a conclusive refutation</b> to the opinion <b>of Rava?</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rava</b> could have <b>said to you</b> in response: <b>And according to your reasoning</b> that a betrothal that is not given to consummation is still betrothal, <b>say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>An incident</b> occurred <b>involving five women, and among them</b> were <b>two sisters.

            "The Gemara continues to explain what Rava could have said. <b>What are the circumstances? If we say that he said: You are all</b> betrothed to me, this <b>is</b> comparable to one who gives something to another and says: <b>Let you and the donkey acquire</b> this item. <b>And</b> in a situation where someone would say: Let <b>you and the donkey</b> acquire it, the recipient has <b>not acquired</b> the item. Since the donkey cannot acquire items the person does not acquire it either, because the owner linked the two acquisitions. Here too, since he tried to give the item of the betrothal to all of the women, some of whom, the sisters, he cannot betroth together, the betrothal should not take effect even with the other women despite the fact that they are suitable for him."

The <i>ḥalitza</i> of one of the brothers suffices to release her from her levirate bond. According to Rava this betrothal should not be valid, as it is not given to consummation.

From where does Rabbi Meir derive that second tithe cannot be used for betrothal? <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, says in the name of tradition:</b> The verse states: <b>“And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord’s; it is holy to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 27:30). This verse indicates that <b>it is for the Lord, but not for betrothing a woman with it.</b>",
            "The Gemara questions this derivation from several instances where similar wording is employed in a different verse, yet one may use those items for betrothal. But <b>there is <i>teruma</i> of the tithe,</b> about <b>which it is written: “So you also shall set apart a gift of the Lord</b> of all your tithes” (Numbers 18:28)? <b>And we learned</b> in a mishna (58a): With regard to <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with <i>teruma</i>, she is betrothed.</b> The Gemara answers: <i>Teruma</i> of the tithe is different, <b>as “to the Lord” is not written with regard to it,</b> indicating that it can be used for betrothal.",

If the money changer untied the bundle and used the money, and it turned out that it was consecrated, the money changer is liable to bring an offering for the misuse of consecrated property, since he acted without the permission of the depositor. If the money was not in a bundle, the money changer has the right to use it, since the depositor knows that a money changer frequently distributes money. Consequently, in this case, if the money was consecrated, it is the depositor who is liable to bring an offering for the misuse of consecrated property, since the money changer is considered to have acted with his awareness. If one deposited the money with a homeowner, i.e., not a money changer, the latter may not use it in either case, and he is liable to bring an offering for the misuse of consecrated property if he does. With regard to a storekeeper, the <i>tanna’im</i> disagree: The same <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>a storekeeper as</b> to <b>a homeowner;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> But <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The same <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>a storekeeper as</b> to <b>a money changer.</b>",

This indicates that even according to the opinion of Rabbi Meir, whatever transaction he performed did take effect. The Gemara rejects this: <b>Rabbi Meir stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> as follows: <b>According to me, if he spent</b> the money <b>he has also not misused</b> consecrated property, <b>but according to you, at least concede to me that</b> the same <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>a storekeeper as to a homeowner.

If a priest betrothed a woman with such garments, Rabbi Meir holds that if he did so unwittingly she is not betrothed, since clothes of this kind are not desacralized, and do not become hers. This is <b>because they were</b> initially <b>given</b> on the condition that the priests may <b>benefit from them</b> even when not performing the Temple service, <b>since the Torah was not given to the ministering angels.</b> It is impossible for a priest to wear the garments only at the moment he is performing the service and at no other time.

The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> this <i>halakha</i> applies <b>specifically</b> to garments that <b>have worn out.</b> Since these cannot be used by priests, the permission to use them for non-sacred purposes lapses, and they are like other consecrated property that is subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of misuse.",

Most of the animals in Jerusalem were designated for offerings, and presumably this one was as well. <b>Males</b> are presumed to be <b>burnt-offerings,</b> as only males can be brought as burnt-offerings. <b>Females</b> are presumed to be <b>peace-offerings,</b> as it is permitted to bring a female peace-offering.",
            "The Gemara questions this: <b>But are males</b> only <b>burnt-offerings and not</b> also <b>peace-offerings?</b> As peace-offerings can be male or female, a male animal that was found might have been designated as a peace-offering. <b>Rabbi Oshaya said:</b> We are not speaking <b>here</b> of bringing the animals themselves as offerings. Rather, <b>we are dealing with one who comes to obligate</b> himself to consecrate <b>their value.</b> The finder wants to consecrate the value of the animal in case it had been designated as an offering, thereby redeeming the animal and desacralizing it, <b>and this is</b> what the mishna is <b>saying:</b> In the case of males <b>we are concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> they are <b>burnt-offerings,</b> so the money must be consecrated for the purpose of burnt-offerings as well as peace-offerings. <b>And this is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says: Consecrated</b> property <b>is desacralized</b> if it is misused <b>intentionally.</b> Therefore, he may redeem the animal and must use the money to purchase both a peace-offering and a burnt-offering, thereby avoiding all uncertainty.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> can something that has <b>inherent sanctity,</b> such as an animal that has been designated as an offering, <b>be desacralized? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Me’ila</i> 19b): <b>There is no misuse after misuse with regard to consecrated</b> property? This means that if one misuses consecrated property, the item is immediately desacralized and the prohibition of misuse no longer applies to it. This is so <b>apart from</b> the case of the misuse of <b>an animal</b> designated as an offering <b>and</b> apart <b>from</b> the case of the misuse of <b>service vessels alone.</b> These do not become desacralized when misused, because they have inherent sanctity.",
            "That mishna continues: <b>How</b> so? If someone <b>was riding on</b> a consecrated <b>animal,</b> and <b>another came</b> after him <b>and</b> also <b>rode</b> on it, and yet <b>another came and rode</b> on it, <b>they have all misused</b> consecrated property. Similarly, if one <b>was drinking from a golden cup</b> used in the Temple service, and <b>another came and drank</b> from it, and yet <b>another came and drank</b> from it, <b>they have all misused</b> consecrated property. The Gemara asks: As this indicates that an item that has inherent sanctity is never desacralized, how can it be redeemed? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> mishna, from tractate <i>Me’ila</i>, <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> whereas <b>this</b> mishna, from tractate <i>Shekalim</i>, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir.</b>",

            "The Gemara questions Rav Oshaya’s explanation of the mishna: <b>Say that you have heard Rabbi Meir</b> express the opinion that one can desacralize a consecrated item <b>in</b> the case of <b>offerings of the most sacred order,</b> but <b>did you hear him</b> express this opinion <b>in</b> the case of <b>offerings of lesser sanctity,</b> e.g., a peace-offering? If Rabbi Meir holds that offerings of lesser sanctity cannot be desacralized, the explanation of Rabbi Oshaya would be insufficient, as it does not account for the possibility that the animal is a peace-offering. <b>One of the Sages, and his name was Rabbi Ya’akov, said to him:</b> This is learned by means of <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: If <b>offerings of the most sacred order</b> can <b>be desacralized,</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> the case that this <i>halakha</i> would apply to <b>offerings of lesser sanctity?</b>",

Here, too, with regard to the ox that is stoned, the phrase: “Its flesh shall not be eaten,” may serve to teach that one may not derive benefit from the stoned ox.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>This statement</b> of Rabbi Abbahu <b>applies only</b> to a case <b>where we derive the prohibition</b> against <b>eating from the words: “It may not be eaten,”</b> which is interpreted to include any manner of consumption. But <b>here, the prohibition</b> against <b>eating is derived from: “It shall be stoned,”</b> from which it is understood that since the ox becomes an unslaughtered animal carcass, it may not be eaten. <b>As if it enters your mind that</b> the phrase: “Its flesh may not be eaten,” <b>is written to prohibit</b> one from deriving <b>benefit, let the verse state: “One may not derive benefit.”</b> Why does it refer to eating if that prohibition has already been derived?",
            "<b>Alternatively,</b> even if one would say that the phrase: <b>“It shall not be eaten,”</b> can be used to indicate that it is prohibited to derive benefit from the ox, <b>why do I</b> need the additional words <b>“its flesh”?</b> These words must teach that <b>although he slaughtered</b> the ox <b>like</b> one does with kosher <b>meat,</b> after it was condemned to be stoned, it remains <b>forbidden</b> and cannot be eaten.",
            "<b>Mar Zutra objects to this: But say</b> that <b>this</b> prohibition against eating the ox <b>applies</b> only <b>where he examined</b> a sharp <b>stone</b> to ensure that it had no nicks, <b>and slaughtered with it</b> in a halakhically acceptable manner.

The Torah teaches that even if it was killed in this manner, one is prohibited from eating it. <b>But</b> if <b>he slaughtered it with a knife,</b> he should <b>not</b> be prohibited from eating it. The Gemara expresses surprise at this reasoning: <b>Was a knife written in the Torah?</b> If one slaughters the animal in a halakhically acceptable manner, this is called slaughtering, not stoning. <b>And moreover, it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Ḥullin</i> 1:2): One may <b>slaughter with anything</b> that cuts cleanly, <b>whether with a stone, whether with glass, whether with the stalk of a reed.</b> Consequently, there is no difference in the <i>halakha</i> with regard to using a knife or a sharp stone.",

The Gemara answers: This derivation is not applied, <b>because</b> an object of <b>idol worship and</b> produce of the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year <b>are two verses that come as one,</b> i.e., to teach the same matter, since both prohibitions also extend to the money obtained for them, <b>and any two verses that come as one do not teach</b> their common aspect to apply to other cases.",
            "The Gemara clarifies: The source indicating that this is true of an object of <b>idol worship</b> is <b>what we said. What is</b> the source indicating that this <i>halakha</i> applies to produce of the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year? The verse states: <b>“It is a Jubilee, it shall be holy to you”</b> (Leviticus 25:12), from which it is derived: <b>Just as consecrated property transfers</b> its sanctity to the <b>money</b> with which <b>it</b> is redeemed, <b>so too,</b> produce of <b>the Sabbatical</b> Year, which has the same status as the Jubilee Year, <b>transfers</b> its sanctity to the <b>money</b> with which it is redeemed. Consequently, money used to acquire the produce of the Sabbatical Year will be subject to the same <i>halakhot</i> as the produce itself.",
            "<b>If</b> so, one could also say that <b>just as</b> with <b>consecrated</b> property, it <b>transfers</b> its sanctity to the <b>money</b> with which <b>it</b> is redeemed <b>and becomes desacralized, so too,</b> produce of the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year should <b>transfer</b> its sanctity to the <b>money</b> with which it is redeemed and <b>becomes desacralized.</b> Nevertheless, <b>the verse states: “Shall be,”</b> meaning: <b>As it is,</b> so <b>it shall be,</b> indicating that the Sabbatical-Year produce does not become desacralized.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>How so?</b> If one <b>purchased meat with produce</b> of the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year, both <b>these and those,</b> i.e., the meat and the produce, <b>are disposed of in the Sabbatical</b> Year. The sanctity of the Sabbatical Year takes effect with regard to the meat as well. It is treated like the produce, and must be disposed of when the obligation to dispose of the Sabbatical-Year produce goes into effect. If he then purchases <b>fish with</b> this <b>meat,</b> the <b>meat loses</b> its consecrated status, and the <b>fish assumes</b> the consecrated state. If he then purchases <b>wine with</b> these <b>fish,</b> the <b>fish loses</b> its consecrated status and the <b>wine assumes</b> the consecrated state.

            "Rav Pappa explains that the standard of <b>“if water is placed [<i>ki yuttan</i>]”</b> is <b>similar to: If one places [<i>ki yitten</i>]; just as</b> the term <b>places [<i>yitten</i>]</b> indicates <b>that</b> it is <b>satisfactory to</b> the owner for the produce to become wet, as he himself is placing the water, <b>so too,</b> the term <b>“is placed [<i>yuttan</i>]”</b> means <b>that</b> it is <b>satisfactory to</b> the owner that the produce becomes wet, despite the fact that he did not place the water himself. This is proof that thought is equivalent to action with regard to ritual impurity, as if one is satisfied with the produce becoming wet it is considered as though he actively placed the water himself. By the same reasoning, thought which renders a vessel susceptible to ritual impurity is powerful enough to require an action to counteract its effect.",
            "The Gemara presents another version of the discussion: <b>Rav Zevid taught this</b> dispute <b>with regard to this</b> <i>halakha</i>: <b>And similarly,</b> in a case <b>where she gave permission to her agent to accept betrothal for her and she</b> subsequently <b>went and accepted betrothal herself</b> from someone else, <b>if her</b> betrothal <b>came first, her betrothal is</b> a valid <b>betrothal, but if</b> the betrothal <b>of her agent came first, her betrothal is not a betrothal.</b>",
            "The Sages discuss this <i>halakha</i>: If she did <b>not accept betrothal herself and retracted</b> her appointment of the agent, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: She can retract</b> her appointment; <b>and Reish Lakish says: She cannot retract</b> her appointment. The Gemara clarifies their respective opinions. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: She can retract</b> her appointment, as <b>a statement comes and nullifies</b> a previous <b>statement,</b> by which she appointed the agent. <b>Reish Lakish said: She cannot retract</b> her appointment, as <b>a statement does not come and nullify</b> a previous <b>statement.</b>",

            "§ The mishna teaches that if a man betroths a woman and stipulates that the betrothal will take effect in thirty days’ time and another man betroths her within that period, <b>she is betrothed to the second</b> man. <b>Rav says: She is betrothed to the second forever,</b> i.e., the betrothal is fully effective, <b>and Shmuel says: She is betrothed to the second until</b> the <b>thirty days</b> pass. <b>After thirty days</b> have passed, <b>the betrothal of the second lapses, and the</b> earlier <b>betrothal of the first</b> man <b>is completed.</b>",

Why, then, is the second betrothal abrogated? <b>Rav Yosef said to him: The Master teaches</b> this dispute <b>with regard to the first clause</b> of the mishna, <b>and</b> therefore <b>he</b> finds it <b>difficult,</b> whereas <b>Rav Yehuda teaches</b> it with regard <b>to the latter clause</b> of the mishna, <b>and</b> consequently <b>he does not</b> find it <b>difficult.</b>",
            "Rav Yehuda’s version of the dispute is as follows: The mishna teaches that if the first man says to her: You are hereby betrothed to me <b>from now and after thirty days,</b> and another man betrothed her within those thirty days, there is uncertainty whether she is betrothed or whether she is not betrothed. <b>Rav says:</b> This means that there is uncertainty whether <b>she is betrothed or</b> whether <b>she is not betrothed forever,</b> and her only option is to receive a bill of divorce from both men. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> There is uncertainty whether <b>she is betrothed or</b> whether <b>she is not betrothed only until thirty days</b> have elapsed, whereas <b>after thirty</b> days <b>the betrothal of the second</b> is <b>abrogated, and the betrothal of the first is completed.</b>",
            "The Gemara explains their respective opinions: <b>Rav is uncertain</b> what the first man meant. <b>Is it a condition,</b> i.e., the man is saying: If I do not change my mind within thirty days, you are betrothed to me from now, or <b>is it a retraction,</b> that is, he immediately retracted after he said: From now, in favor of a betrothal that will take effect only after thirty days have elapsed. This uncertainty remains even after the end of the thirty days. <b>It is obvious to Shmuel that it is a condition.</b> Consequently, the uncertainty whether or not she is betrothed to the second man applies during the thirty-day period, as the first man might yet change his mind. After the completion of thirty days, the betrothal from the first man retroactively takes effect from the moment he gave it, and therefore the betrothal of the second man is abrogated.",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And let Rav,</b> instead of explaining his own opinion, <b>say</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, and let Shmuel say</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.

            "Rav Ḥanina explains his objection: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>supports him,</b> as Rav maintains that the meaning of this expression is uncertain. <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel as well,</b> although he claims that the phrase is a condition rather than a retraction, he can explain as follows: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who claim in that case that it is uncertain if she is divorced, <b>and I,</b> Shmuel, <b>say</b> my ruling <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.",

        ],
        [
            "With regard to <b>one who consecrates his field during the time of the Jubilee</b> Year, i.e., in an era when the <i>halakhot</i> of the Jubilee Year are observed, if he wishes to redeem it from the Temple treasury <b>he gives fifty silver shekels for</b> an area that yields <b>a <i>ḥomer</i>,</b> i.e., a <i>kor</i>, of <b>barley seed.</b> If the field <b>had crevices,</b> i.e., deep fissures in its surface, <b>ten handbreadths deep, or boulders ten handbreadths high, they are not measured with it,</b> i.e., in the calculation of land that requires redemption. If the crevices or boulders are <b>less than that, they are measured with it.</b>",
            "<b>And we discussed</b> the following problem: <b>Granted, that</b> these areas <b>are not consecrated</b> together <b>with the field,</b> as they are ten handbreadths higher or lower than the rest of the land; but <b>let</b> the crevices and boulders <b>be consecrated by themselves,</b> so that they should require their own redemption of fifty silver shekels per <i>beit kor</i>. <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>as long as</b> an area <b>does not</b> amount to <b>a <i>beit kor</i> it is not important,</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> against this claim from a <i>baraita</i>.",
            "The verse states with regard to one who consecrates his field: “Part of <b>a field</b> of his possession” (Leviticus 27:16). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> this? <b>Since it is stated</b> in the same verse: <b>“The sowing of a <i>ḥomer</i> of barley shall be valued at fifty</b> shekels of silver,” <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies to one who <b>consecrated in this manner,</b> i.e., consecrated an area fit to sow a <i>ḥomer</i> of barley. <b>From where</b> do I derive that this <i>halakha</i> <b>includes</b> a smaller area, e.g., one suitable for sowing <b>a half-<i>kor</i>, and half of a half-<i>kor</i>,</b> and the area for <b>a <i>se’a</i>,</b> and <b>a <i>tarkav</i>,</b> which is half a <i>se’a</i>, <b>and half a <i>tarkav</i>, and even</b> the area of <b>a quarter</b>-<i>kav</i>? The <i>baraita</i> restates its question: <b>From where</b> is it derived that these areas of land can also be consecrated and redeemed based on the fixed values of the Torah? <b>The verse states “a field” in any case.</b>",
            "Therefore, the Gemara’s question remains: Why aren’t the crevices and boulders measured by themselves? <b>Mar Ukva bar Ḥama said: Here we are dealing with crevices filled with water. Due to</b> the fact <b>that they are not fit for sowing,</b> the crevices are not considered a field. The Gemara comments: The language of the mishna <b>is also precise, as it teaches</b> the case of crevices, <b>similar to</b> the case of <b>high boulders,</b> which are also unsuitable for sowing. The Gemara affirms: <b>Learn from</b> this comparison that this explanation is correct.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> i.e., if the crevices, like the boulders, are unfit for sowing, then <b>even</b> if there is a disparity of <b>less than</b> ten handbreadths <b>as well,</b> the crevices and boulders should likewise not be measured as part of the field. The Gemara answers: If they are separated from the field by less than ten handbreadths, <b>these</b> crevices <b>are called the cracks in the ground.</b> Similarly, boulders less than ten handbreadths high <b>are called the spine of the ground.</b> They are considered regular features of fields, which typically have a few pits and mounds.",
            "<b>With regard to a sale</b> of a field, <b>we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Batra</i> 102b): In the case of <b>one who says to another: I am selling you a <i>beit kor</i> of earth,</b> if <b>there were crevices ten handbreadths deep or boulders ten handbreadths high</b> in the field, <b>they are not measured with it;</b> if the crevices or boulders were <b>less than that, they are measured with it. And Mar Ukva bar Ḥama says: Even if they are not filled with water,</b> nevertheless they are not included.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this difference between the two rulings of Mar Ukva bar Ḥama? Why in the case of a sale are crevices not considered part of the field even if they are not filled with water? <b>Rav Pappa says: Because a person</b> who buys a field <b>does not want to give his money for one field and</b> yet <b>it appears to him like two or three places.</b> When purchasing a parcel of land, it is important to the purchaser that the land be one contiguous unit so as to enable farming it without difficulty. Therefore, these areas of ten handbreadths are not measured as part of the field regardless of whether or not they are filled with water.",
            "Having discussed the <i>halakhot</i> of a field with regard to consecration and sales, the Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> <b>here,</b> with regard to measuring a field to see if it fulfills the condition stipulated by one who betroths a woman, if it contains large crevices that are not filled with water?

The Gemara answers: <b>It stands to reason</b> that <b>we compare it to</b> the case of <b>consecrated</b> property, <b>as</b> the husband can <b>say to her: I will go to the trouble of sowing and bringing</b> the produce from the lower or higher areas as well. Although the labor requires additional effort, he does possess a <i>beit kor</i> of land.",

Therefore, the subsequent phrase “the land of Canaan” is superfluous and serves to teach that the condition must be doubled.",
            "<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to this issue that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel said:</b> Hear <b>a parable: To what is this matter,</b> i.e., the condition of the children of Gad and Reuben, <b>comparable?</b> It is comparable <b>to a person who was dividing up his property among his sons,</b> and <b>said: My son so-and-so shall inherit such and such a field; and my son so-and-so shall inherit such and such a field; and my son so-and-so shall give two hundred dinars and inherit such and such a field, and if he does not give</b> the money <b>he will inherit</b> a part <b>of the remainder of the property with his brothers.</b>",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> the <b>parable is not similar to the mishna,</b> as <b>there</b> the mishna <b>teaches: It might have</b> been thought it <b>meant that</b> if they do not fulfill the condition <b>they will not inherit even in the land of Canaan,</b> and certainly not in the land of Gilead.

            "The Gemara elaborates: <b>Rav said</b> that the court <b>does not stone</b> her, because <b>when the Merciful One deems the father credible</b> when he says he betrothed his daughter, this is referring only <b>to the prohibition</b> against her marrying anyone else.

His authority extends only to his minor daughters. The Gemara answers: <b>Here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the adult daughter <b>appointed</b> her father as her <b>agent</b> to accept her betrothal, and he proceeds to betroth one of his daughters without specifying which one. <b>Lest you say</b> with regard to this situation that <b>when</b> he <b>accepts</b> the <b>betrothal he accepts</b> it <b>with</b> his adult daughter <b>in mind,</b> as he is her agent, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that <b>a person does not put aside a matter from which he derives benefit,</b> i.e., the betrothal of his minor daughter, where he keeps the money, <b>and perform a matter from which he does not derive benefit,</b> i.e., the betrothal of his adult daughter, where she keeps the money.",

The Gemara counters: <b>Even so, a person does not put aside a mitzva that is imposed upon him,</b> i.e., the betrothal of his minor daughter, <b>to perform a mitzva that is not</b> directly <b>imposed upon him,</b> the betrothal of his adult daughter. Since she is of age, her betrothal is her own responsibility.",
            "§ The mishna taught: With regard to <b>one who has two groups of daughters</b> and betrothed the elder of them, but was unsure which one he meant, Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yosei dispute which of them is betrothed. The mishna adds that the same dispute applies if he betrothed his younger daughter. The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state this <i>halakha</i> in both cases, <b>as had</b> the mishna <b>taught us</b> only that the <i>tanna’im</i> disagree with regard to the <b>first</b> case, one might have claimed that <b>in this</b> case <b>Rabbi Meir says</b> that they are all prohibited except for the youngest daughter of the younger group.

            "The Gemara asks a question with regard to these opinions: <b>Is this to say that Rabbi Meir maintains: A person places himself in</b> a situation of <b>uncertainty,</b> i.e., people issue statements and accept upon themselves obligations that are not clearly defined, <b>and Rabbi Yosei maintains</b> that <b>a person does not place himself in</b> a situation of <b>uncertainty,</b> as one has only well-defined situations in mind? <b>But haven’t we learned</b> that these two <i>tanna’im</i> state <b>the opposite</b> opinions, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Nedarim</i> 60a): If <b>one takes a vow</b> that wine is forbidden to him <b>until Passover, it is forbidden</b> to him <b>until</b> Passover <b>arrives.</b> If he said: <b>Until it will be</b> Passover, <b>it is forbidden</b> to him <b>until</b> Passover <b>ends.</b>",

This is the opposite of the above interpretation of the mishna concerning a man who betroths his daughter.",

The mishna then provides several examples illustrating the same principle. The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for the mishna to specify all these cases. The Gemara elaborates: <b>As, had</b> the mishna <b>taught us</b> the <i>halakha</i> only <b>with regard to himself,</b> i.e., the case where he claims to have betrothed the woman, one might have said that he is not deemed credible at all, <b>because a man does not care</b> if <b>he happens to say</b> that he betrothed a woman even if he did not do so, as he can betroth another woman.",

The Gemara answers: It <b>was necessary</b> to state this case too, as it might <b>enter your mind to say:</b> Since <b>by Torah law, the Merciful One deems credible a father</b> who claims to have betrothed his daughter to a particular person, perhaps the Sages <b>deem</b> a mother <b>credible by rabbinic law, and</b> therefore <b>her daughter should be forbidden</b> based <b>on her statement.</b> The mishna therefore <b>teaches us</b> that a mother is not believed with regard to her daughter.",

The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> the mishna <b>taught this</b> other case, of a man claiming he betrothed a woman and the woman replying that it was her daughter, <b>it also taught this</b> last case, so that it mentions all the permutations, despite the fact that this particular case provides no novelty.",

            "<b>Rabbi Tarfon said</b> in response: There is <b>a parable</b> that illustrates this.

These sought the registry of their genealogy, but it was not found. Therefore, they were deemed polluted and put out from the priesthood.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who says</b> that <b>one elevates</b> a priest <b>to lineage,</b> i.e., one attributes the lineage of a priest to an individual on the basis of observing him partaking of <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> how could they be allowed to partake of <i>teruma</i>? <b>Those who partake of <i>teruma</i> will</b> subsequently <b>be elevated</b> to the full status of priests.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>what</b> is the meaning of Rabbi Yosei’s claim that <b>great</b> is <b>a presumptive status?</b> They received nothing extra by virtue of this presumption. The Gemara responds: They have gained in <b>that initially they would partake of <i>teruma</i></b> only of Babylonian produce, which is <i>teruma</i> <b>by rabbinic law, and afterward they would partake of</b> produce that is <b><i>teruma</i> by Torah law.</b> The separation of <i>teruma</i> in Eretz Yisrael is a Torah obligation, and the produce is fully consecrated.",
            "The Gemara offers an additional defense of the opinion that one elevates a priest to lineage based on observing him partake of <i>teruma</i>: <b>And if you wish, say: Actually, now also,</b> in Eretz Yisrael, <b>they would partake</b> only <b>of</b> produce that is <i>teruma</i> <b>by rabbinic law,</b> such as vegetables, while <b>they would not partake of</b> produce that is <i>teruma</i> <b>by Torah law,</b> such as grains. <b>And when we elevate</b> a priest <b>to lineage</b> on the basis of observing him partake of <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> that is only when he was observed partaking of produce that is <i>teruma</i> <b>by Torah law,</b> but if someone partakes of produce that is <i>teruma</i> <b>by rabbinic law, we do not elevate</b> him.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> the question remains: <b>What</b> is meant by the phrase: <b>Great</b> is <b>a presumptive status?</b> The Gemara answers: It means <b>that initially, there was no</b> reason <b>to decree</b> and prohibit them from partaking of produce that was <i>teruma</i> by rabbinic law <b>due to</b> the possibility that they may partake of produce that is <b><i>teruma</i> by Torah law,</b> as there was no produce that was <i>teruma</i> by Torah law in Babylonia. <b>Afterward,</b> when they came to Eretz Yisrael, <b>although there was reason to decree</b> and prohibit them from partaking of produce that was <i>teruma</i> by rabbinic law <b>due to</b> the possibility that they may partake of produce that was <b><i>teruma</i> by Torah law,</b> as that kind of <i>teruma</i> was also present, their presumptive status was nevertheless strong enough to allow them to continue <b>to partake of</b> produce that was <b><i>teruma</i> by rabbinic law,</b> although they could <b>not eat</b> produce that is <b><i>teruma</i> by Torah law.</b>",

The Gemara explains that these names are to be interpreted as follows: <b>“Tel Melah”; these are people whose</b> licentious <b>actions were similar to the act of Sodom, which was turned into a mound of salt [<i>tel melaḥ</i>]. “Tel Harsha”; this</b> is referring to one <b>who calls</b> a man <b>father, and his mother silences him,</b> as the word <i>ḥarsha</i> is similar to <i>maḥarishto</i>, meaning: Silences him.

            "The Gemara continues with its explication of the verse: <b>“But they could not tell their fathers’ houses, nor their offspring, whether they were of Israel”; this</b> is referring to <b>a foundling who is gathered from the marketplace.</b> Such a person does not even know if he is Jewish, as he has no knowledge of his parents.

            "§ The Gemara discusses an idea raised earlier. <b>Rabbi Avin bar Rav Adda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> Concerning <b>anyone who marries a woman who is not suited for him</b> to marry, <b>when the Holy One, Blessed be He, rests His Divine Presence</b> upon the Jewish people, <b>He testifies with regard to all the tribes</b> that they are His people, <b>but He does not testify with regard to he</b> who married improperly, <b>as it is stated: “The tribes of the Lord, as a testimony to Israel”</b> (Psalms 122:4). <b>When is it a testimony to Israel?

The explanation is as follows: <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said: Not as I am written am I pronounced.

This contradicts their earlier statements, in which Rav prohibited one whose flaw results from an uncertainty from marrying one with definite <i>mamzer</i> status and Shmuel permitted it. The Gemara answers: <b>Reverse</b> the opinions in this dispute, so that <b>Rav</b> is the one who <b>says: The offspring is a <i>shetuki</i></b> and is prohibited to marry a <i>mamzeret</i>; <b>and Shmuel says: The offspring is a <i>mamzer</i></b> and may marry a <i>mamzeret</i>.",
            "The Gemara asks: If so, <b>why do I</b> need <b>two</b> instances of the same dispute?

            "The Gemara answers: It is <b>necessary</b> for Shmuel to rule twice. <b>As, if</b> he had learned it only <b>from there,</b> from the mishna discussing an unmarried pregnant woman, <b>I would say</b> he rules that way <b>there,</b> when <b>the majority are fit with regard to her,</b> as her unmarried status means that the offspring resulting from sexual intercourse with most men would be of unflawed lineage. <b>But here,</b> in the case of a betrothed woman, when <b>the majority</b> of men <b>are unfit with regard to her,</b> as she is forbidden to everyone other than her betrothed, <b>you</b> might <b>say</b> that she should <b>not</b> be deemed credible to say she engaged in intercourse with the betrothed man.

Rav Yosef understands that Rabbi Elazar regards a Samaritan as being like a convert after ten generations, who may not marry a <i>mamzeret</i>. Since Samaritans assimilated among the Jewish people and are no longer recognized by the public as having Samaritan lineage, they may not marry those of flawed lineage, including, presumably, other Samaritans.",
            "<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>Is it comparable</b> to the case of a convert? <b>There,</b> he is <b>an old convert,</b> i.e., the conversion occurred a long time ago, <b>and she is a new <i>mamzeret</i>,</b> i.e., her status as a <i>mamzeret</i> is known.

If he holds</b> that <b>a prohibition takes effect</b> where another <b>prohibition</b> already exists, i.e., if an item or a person is rendered forbidden by a prohibition then another prohibition can take effect in addition to the first one, <b>the reverse</b> should <b>also</b> be the case, i.e., if she was initially a <i>zona</i> and subsequently became a <i>ḥalala</i>, the same two prohibitions should apply to her. <b>And if he holds</b> that <b>a prohibition does not take effect</b> where another <b>prohibition</b> already exists, he should <b>likewise not</b> be liable to receive more than one set of lashes <b>even</b> if they occurred <b>in this order.</b>",
            "<b>Rava said:</b> In general, <b>this <i>tanna</i> does not</b> accept the principle that <b>a prohibition takes effect</b> where <b>another prohibition</b> already exists, but <b>he holds</b> that it does take effect in the case of <b>an expanded prohibition.</b> If the second prohibition adds people to the category of those to whom the item is forbidden, then it takes effect in addition to the previous prohibition, which had a more limited range.",
            "In this case, <b>a widow is forbidden to a High Priest but is permitted to a common priest.</b> Once <b>she becomes a divorcée, since a prohibition has been added to her with regard to a common priest,</b> as a common priest is prohibited from marrying a divorcée, the <b>prohibition is</b> also <b>added to her with regard to a High Priest. And</b> at this stage, <b>she is still permitted to partake of <i>teruma</i></b> if she is the daughter of a priest. When <b>she becomes a <i>ḥalala</i></b> by engaging in sexual intercourse with a priest, <b>since a prohibition</b> for her <b>to eat <i>teruma</i> has been added,</b> the <b>prohibition</b> with regard to a <i>ḥalala</i> <b>is</b> also <b>added with regard to a High Priest</b> who engages in intercourse with her, in addition to the prohibitions of a widow and a divorcée. It is only if they occurred in this order that each prohibition adds to the previous one, but not if they happened in the reverse order.",
            "Yet, one could ask: <b>But</b> in the case of <b>a <i>zona</i>, what expanded prohibition is there with regard to her?</b> There is no additional prohibition with a <i>zona</i> beyond what is prohibited with regard to a <i>ḥalala</i>. <b>Rav Ḥana bar Rav Ketina said: Since the label of <i>zenut</i> disqualifies</b> her <b>in Israel,</b> it is viewed as an expanded prohibition. Although a <i>zona</i> as precisely defined in this context, i.e., a woman who engages in sexual intercourse with one who is unfit for her, is prohibited only to priests and does not add any prohibition beyond that of a <i>ḥalala</i>, the label of a <i>zona</i> in its broader sense, such as a married woman who commits adultery, does disqualify her to an Israelite, namely her husband. Therefore, there is a prohibition with regard to a <i>zona</i> that has a greater scope than the prohibition with regard to a <i>ḥalala</i>.",
            "<b>A <i>tanna</i> taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Sheshet:</b> The command addressed to the High Priest states: “A widow, or one divorced, or a <i>ḥalala</i>, or a <i>zona</i>, these shall he not take; but a virgin of his own people shall he take to wife” (Leviticus 21:14). <b>Any</b> woman <b>who is</b> included <b>in</b> the mitzva: <b>“Shall he take” is</b> included <b>in</b> the prohibition: <b>“Shall he not take”</b> if she becomes a widow or a divorcée. And <b>any</b> woman <b>who is not</b> included <b>in</b> the mitzva: <b>“Shall he take” is not</b> included <b>in</b> the prohibition: <b>“Shall he not take.”</b> This <b>excludes</b> the case <b>of a High Priest who engaged in intercourse with his widowed sister.</b> As his sister, she is forbidden to him even when she is a virgin, so the mitzva: “Shall he take” does not refer to her. Therefore, he does not transgress the prohibition: “Shall he not take” if he engages in intercourse with her after she had been widowed or divorced.",
            "Rav Sheshet <b>said to him:</b> He <b>who said</b> this <b>to you,</b> in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion did he teach it? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who says</b> as a principle: <b>A prohibition does not take effect</b> where another <b>prohibition</b> already exists. Therefore, his sister, who was already forbidden to him by virtue of being his sister, is not forbidden due to the additional prohibition: “Shall he not take.” <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon says: One who eats</b> an unslaughtered <b>animal carcass on Yom Kippur is exempt</b> from <i>karet</i> for eating on the fast day, since the prohibition against eating an animal carcass applied to it beforehand. <b>As, if</b> you say this <i>baraita</i> follows the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, don’t they say: A prohibition takes effect where another prohibition</b> already <b>exists?</b>",
            "The Gemara rejects this: <b>You</b> can <b>even say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, as when the Rabbis say</b> that <b>a prohibition takes effect where another prohibition</b> already <b>exists, that statement</b> applies only when the second prohibition is a more <b>severe prohibition,</b> e.g., eating on Yom Kippur, which takes effect in addition <b>to a light prohibition,</b> in this case, eating an unslaughtered animal carcass. <b>But a light prohibition does not take effect</b> in addition <b>to a severe prohibition.</b> In this case, the prohibition of engaging in intercourse with one’s sister, which is punishable by <i>karet</i>, is more severe than that of: “A widow or one divorced, or a <i>ḥalala</i>, or a <i>zona</i>, these shall he not take,” which is punishable by flogging.",
            "<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that Rav Sheshet said to the <i>tanna</i> as follows: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this?

And when the Rabbis say</b> that <b>a prohibition takes effect where another prohibition</b> already <b>exists, that statement</b> applies when the second prohibition is a more <b>severe prohibition,</b> which takes effect in addition <b>to a light prohibition, but a light prohibition does not take effect</b> in addition <b>to a severe prohibition. As, if</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, now</b> that he holds that even <b>a severe prohibition does not take effect</b> in addition <b>to a light prohibition, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to say that <b>a light prohibition does not take effect</b> in addition <b>to a severe prohibition?</b> There would be no novelty in this ruling of the <i>baraita</i>.",
            "The Gemara rejects this: It is necessary, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>a prohibition</b> involving the <b>priesthood is different.</b> You might say that since there are many stringencies that apply only to priests, then with regard to prohibitions of the priesthood, a second prohibition should take effect in addition to a first one. He therefore <b>teaches us</b> that Rabbi Shimon holds that the second prohibition does not take effect even when it is one addressed to members of the priesthood.",
            "§ <b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye:</b> In the case of <b>an Israelite who engages in intercourse with his sister,</b> this <b>makes her a <i>zona</i></b> and she is forbidden to a priest. But does <b>he</b> also <b>make her a <i>ḥalala</i></b> so that a priest who engages in intercourse with her is also liable for violating the prohibition of engaging in intercourse with a <i>ḥalala</i>, <b>or</b> perhaps <b>he does not make her</b> a <i>ḥalala</i>?",
            "The two sides of the question are as follows: <b>Do we say</b> that this is <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: If <b>she becomes a <i>ḥalala</i> by</b> engaging in sexual intercourse for which she <b>is liable</b> for violating only an ordinary <b>prohibition,</b> should she <b>not all the more so</b> be considered a <i>ḥalala</i> <b>by</b> engaging in intercourse for which she <b>is liable</b> to be punished by <b><i>karet</i>?

            "The Gemara questions this statement: This <b>is obvious; is</b> the status of a High Priest any <b>lower</b> than that of a common priest?

His restrictions as a priest are not lessened when he becomes a High Priest. <b>Rather,</b> teach as follows: <b>Just as</b> the prohibition with regard to <b>a divorcée is distinct from</b> that of <b>a <i>zona</i> and a <i>ḥalala</i> in</b> the case of <b>a common priest,</b> since he is liable to receive lashes for each of the prohibitions, <b>so too, a widow is distinct from a divorcée, and a <i>ḥalala</i>,</b> and <b>a <i>zona</i> in</b> the case of <b>a High Priest,</b> and he is liable to receive lashes for each prohibition, despite the fact that they are stated in the same verse (see Leviticus 21:14).",
            "The <i>baraita</i> further asks: <b>Why is</b> the prohibition with regard to <b>a <i>ḥalala</i> stated</b> with regard to a High Priest, as she is forbidden to him even when he is a common priest?

            "<b>Rava raises an objection</b> against Rav Yehuda’s statement from a mishna (<i>Makkot</i> 13a): A High Priest who engages in sexual intercourse with <b>a widow</b> who was previously <b>a divorcée is flogged due to two labels</b> of prohibitions. <b>What, is it not</b> stating that he is flogged due to <b>two labels and no more?</b> This indicates that he receives only one flogging for each prohibition, and not two as Rav Yehuda taught.",
            "The Gemara rejects this: <b>No;</b> it means due to <b>two labels for this,</b> i.e., he is flogged two sets of lashes for engaging in intercourse with a widow, one for transgressing: “Shall he not take,” and one for transgressing: “He shall not profane,” <b>and two labels for that,</b> i.e., engaging in intercourse with a divorcée.",

            "The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the case of a ritual bath, it <b>is different, since it can be said: Maintain an impure</b> item <b>in its presumptive status and say</b> that <b>it was not</b> properly <b>immersed.</b> There, the presumptive status of the item being ritually impure is supported by the current state of the ritual bath, which is now deficient.",
            "The Gemara continues to compare the two cases: <b>On the contrary,</b> it could be said: <b>Maintain the ritual bath in its presumptive status,</b> that it was known to have previously contained the requisite forty <i>se’a</i>, <b>and say</b> that <b>it was not deficient</b> at the time of the immersion and that the items should be considered ritually pure.

            "The Gemara responds: <b>There,</b> in the case of the ritual bath, there are <b>two</b> reasons <b>to weaken</b> the possibility that the items are ritually pure: First, there is a deficient ritual bath at present; second, the item has a presumptive status of impurity. <b>Here,</b> by contrast, there is only <b>one</b> reason <b>to weaken</b> the possibility that she was a young woman at the time of the betrothal, i.e., the fact that she is now a grown woman. Shmuel therefore maintains that her earlier status of young woman is not nullified, and both betrothals must be taken into account.",
            "The Gemara poses another question: <b>And</b> according to <b>Shmuel,</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from</b> the case of <b>a barrel?

            "Before stating the difficulty with Shmuel’s opinion, the Gemara first clarifies the <i>baraita</i>. <b>And we raised a contradiction between</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the <b>barrel</b> and that <b>of</b> the <b>ritual bath: What is different</b> in <b>that here,</b> with regard to the ritual bath, the <i>halakha</i> is that the items are <b>definitely</b> impure, <b>and what is different</b> in <b>that there,</b> with regard to the barrel, it is only <b>uncertain</b> whether the produce remains untithed? In both cases the situation at present, the ritual bath being deficient and the contents of the barrel having turned to vinegar, should lead to a definite conclusion.",
            "The Gemara continues its analysis of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And Rav Ḥanina from Syria says: Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> that <b>taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the <b>barrel? It is Rabbi Shimon, who with regard to a ritual bath also considers</b> it <b>as</b> a matter of <b>uncertainty</b> rather than as definitively impure.

            "<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>All pure items whose</b> purification <b>had been performed in it,</b> i.e., any impure items that had been purified through immersion in the ritual bath that was found to be deficient, <b>retroactive</b> to when the ritual bath was last measured, <b>whether</b> this ritual bath is found <b>in the private domain or in the public domain, are impure. And Rabbi Shimon says</b> they are impure due to the uncertainty, and therefore, if the ritual bath was located <b>in the public domain, they are pure,</b> in accordance with the principle that uncertain cases of impurity in the public domain are deemed pure. But if the ritual bath was located <b>in the private domain,</b> the decision <b>is suspended,</b> i.e., if the impure items came into contact with <i>teruma</i>, one may not partake of the <i>teruma</i> due to the uncertainty, but it is also not burned as though it were definitely impure.",
            "The Gemara returns to complete the difficulty with Shmuel’s opinion: <b>But</b> according <b>to the Rabbis,</b> who hold that in the case of the ritual bath the items are definitely impure, with regard to the wine that had been exempted from <i>teruma</i> by means of separating <i>teruma</i> from the contents of the barrel, that wine will be <b>untithed produce retroactively,</b> since they hold that the current status extends to the past. This is unlike the ruling of Shmuel, who ruled that in the case of the woman who was betrothed to two men it is uncertain to whom she is betrothed. The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the case of the barrel, <b>it is different, as it can be said: Maintain the untithed produce in its presumptive status,</b> as when it first grew it was definitely untithed, <b>and say</b> it was <b>not fixed,</b> i.e., exempted.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>On the contrary,</b> why not <b>maintain the wine in its presumptive status, and say it had not turned to vinegar?</b> The Gemara rejects this: That is impossible, as <b>it is turned to vinegar at present.</b> The Gemara replies: In the case of the betrothal, <b>here too, she is a grown woman at present;</b> what is the difference? The Gemara rejects this claim: With regard to the woman, <b>it is</b> possible that only <b>now has she reached her majority.</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>Here too,</b> it could be that <b>it is</b> only <b>now</b> that <b>it has turned to vinegar,</b> but not earlier.",

By contrast, if a healthy person gave all his property to others, he cannot later retract his bequest. The <i>tanna’im</i> discuss the case of one who gave away all his property and later, seeking to retrieve his property, claims that he was moribund at the time, while the recipients of the bequest maintain that he was healthy. <b>Who</b> is able to <b>remove</b> the property <b>from the possession of whom?</b>",

It is referring <b>to a woman who vowed</b> to <b>be a nazirite, and her husband heard and nullified her</b> vow. <b>And she did not know that her husband had nullified her</b> vow, <b>and she drank wine and contracted impurity from a corpse,</b> violating her presumed vow.",

            "<b>In a similar manner, you</b> can <b>say</b> that the same lesson can be derived from the verse: <b>“Though he know it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 5:17). <b>When Rabbi Akiva came to this verse he would cry.</b> He said: <b>And if</b> with regard to <b>one who intended to eat</b> permitted <b>fat, and</b> forbidden <b>fat</b> mistakenly <b>came up in his hand, the Torah states: “Though he know it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity,” all the more so</b> is this true for <b>one who intended to eat</b> forbidden <b>fat and</b> forbidden <b>fat came up in his hand.
