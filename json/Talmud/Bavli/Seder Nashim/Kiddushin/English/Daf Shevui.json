            "A woman is acquired in three ways and acquires herself in two: She is acquired by money, by document, or by intercourse. “By money”: Bet Shammai says: a denar or the equivalent of a denar; Bet Hillel says: a perutah or the equivalent of a perutah. And how much is a perutah? An eighth of an Italian issar.",

He derives it by connecting “taking” with the “taking” from the field of Ephron:   Here it is written: “When a man takes a wife” (Deuteronomy 22:13); while it is written there: “I will give you money for the field: take it from me” (Genesis 23:13).",

            "Now, why does it to teach shalosh? Let it teach sheloshah?  Because it wants tostate derekh [way], which is feminine, as it is written, “And you shall show them the way [bah] in which they must go” (Exodus 18:20).",
            "If so, that which is taught, “a zav is examined in seven [shiv'ah] ways [derakhim]” let it teach “sheva”?

            "If so, the verses are contradictory, and the mishnayot are contrary? The verses are not contradictory: here [the first verse quoted], the reference is from the Torah, which is a feminine noun, as it is written, “The law [Torah] of the Lord is perfect [temimah], restoring [meshivat] the soul” (Psalms 19:8), so the feminine form was used. There the reference is to war, and it is the practice of man to wage war, not of woman. Therefore the masculine is used.",
            "The mishnayot are not contradictory: here, since the reference is to a woman, it is taught in the feminine. There, the reference is to a man, since it is the nature of a man to be examined, but not of a woman, for a woman becomes unclean even through an accident, the masculine form is employed.",
            "Now, why does it teach shalosh? Because [of the word] derakhim [ways]!  Then let it teach devarim [things] and sheloshah? Because it wishes to teach “intercourse,” and intercourse is called a “way,” as it is written, “And the way of a man with a young woman. . . Such is the way of an adulterous woman” (Proverbs 30:19-20).",

Shimon said: Why did the Torah state, “When a man takes a wife” and not “when a woman is taken by a man”? Because it is the way of a man to go in search of a woman, but it is not the way of a woman to go in search of a man. This may be compared to a man who lost something: who goes in search of whom? The one who lost something goes in search of what is lost.",

            "And as to that which we learned: “An etrog is comparable to a tree in three ways” let it teach [in three] things? Because it wants to teach the second clause: and to vegetables in one way. Then in the second clause too let its state, [and to vegetables in one] “thing”? \n"

And also, that which we learn: This is one of the ways in which women's divorce deeds are similar to slaves writs of manumission, let it teach, “things”?",

Therefore it teaches us [that she does not].",

            "Rav Judah said in the name of Rav: Scripture said, “Then she shall go out for nothing, without money” (Exodus 21:11), [which implies that] this master receives no money but that another master does receive money; And who is he? Her father.",
            "But might it not be suggested that it belongs to her? Now that her father who contracts her betrothal, as it is written in Scripture, “I gave my daughter to this man,” (Deuteronomy 22:16) would she take the money!",
            "But might it not be suggested that this applies only to a minor who has no legal right [to betroth herself], but a na'arah who has such rights may herself contract her betrothal, and she herself receives the money? Scripture stated, “Being in her youth in her father's house” (Numbers 30:17), [implying that] all the advantages of her youth belong to her father.",
            "But what about that which R. Huna said in the name of Rav: From where do we know that a daughter’s handiwork belongs to her father? As it is said, “And if a man sells his daughter to be a maidservant” (Exodus 21:7): just as the handiwork of a maidservant belongs to her master so does the handiwork of a daughter belong to her father.  Now why do I need this verse, deduce it from “Being in her youth in her father's house”?",

In respect of the annulment of vows, at any rate, she goes out of his control; for we have learned: In the case of a betrothed na’arah, the father and her husband jointly annul her vows.",
            "Now, this verse “and she goes out for nothing”, does it come to teach this? Surely it is needed for what was taught, ‘And she goes out for nothing” this refers to the days of bagrut [when she reaches majority age]; “without money” to the days of na’arut!",
            "Ravina said: If so, Scripture should have written, “en kesef [without money]”; what does “ey kesef” mean? There is no money for this master, but there is money for another. And who is he? The father.",
            "And how do you know that we may derive from verses in this way?  Because it was taught: [If a priest's daughter is married to a non-priest, she may not eat of the sacred gifts. But if the priest's daughter is a widow, or divorced,] and has no [eyn] child [. . . she may eat of her father's food]” (Leviticus 22:13). ",

Again, I only know [that] legitimate seed [disqualifies her]: from where do I know that illegitimate seed does as well?   From the verse, “and has no [eyn] child”: examine her.",

There they are two persons, and even had the Torah [explicitly] written, a toshav whose ear was bored, and then added the other, sakhir would be something which might be inferred from a kal vehomer; and a thing which is derived from a kal vehomer the Torah takes the trouble to write.",

            "He wanted to send him one of the Israelites, [but] Pelatiah son of Benaiah said to him, “We, who are more worthy [of higher rank], let us stand before you here; and let our slaves go there.” Thus the prophet cried, ‘That he who did good for Israel should die in middle age!”",
            "And he who said that it was for bad, as it is written, “Then a spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of the Lord’s House, which looked eastward; and behold, at the door of the gate five and twenty men; and I saw in the midst of them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people” (Ezekiel 11:1), and it is written: “And He brought me into the inner court of the Lord’s House, and, behold, at the door of the Temple of the Lord, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the Temple of the Lord, and their faces toward the east” (Ezekiel 8:16).  ",
            "Now, from the implication of what is said: “and their faces toward the east,” do I not know that their backs were toward the west?   So why does Scripture say: “with their backs toward the Temple of the Lord”? This teaches that they exposed themselves defecated towards the Most High. Therefore the prophet said: “Shall he who did this evil in Israel die [peacefully] on his bed!”",
            "Conclude that Shmuel was the one who interpreted it to his discredit. For R. Hiyya b. Abin said in the name of Shmuel: Moshchani is as the Exile in respect to lineage. Mishan—they were not concerned about it on account of slavery or on account of mamzerim, but the priests who dwelt there were not scrupulous about marrying divorced women!",
            "In any case, I could tell you that it could have been Shmuel who interpreted it to his credit; and Shmuel is consistent with his own opinion: for he said: If one renounces ownership of his slave, he goes free and does not require a deed of manumission, for it is said, “But every man’s slave that is bought for money” (Exodus 12:44): a man's slave, but not a woman's slave? [This cannot be. Rather, it means this]: a slave whose master has authority over him is called a slave; a slave whose master has no authority over him is not called a slave.",
            "R. Yehudah said in the name of Shmuel: This is the view of R. Meir. But the Sages hold: All countries have the presumption of fitness.",
            "Amemar permitted R. Huna b. Nathan to take a wife from Mehoza. R. Ashi said to him: What are you basing this on? That R. Yehudah said in the name of Shmuel: This is the view of R. Meir. But the Sages hold: All countries have the presumption of fitness? But the School of R. Kahana did not teach this, and the School of R. Papa did not teach this, and the School of R. Zevi did not teach this? Nevertheless he did not accept this [ruling] from him, because he had heard it from R. Zevid of Nehardea.",
            "Our Rabbis taught: Mamzerim and Nethinim will become pure in the future: this is R. Jose's view. R. Meir said: They will not become pure. Said R. Jose to him: But was it not already stated: And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean?   R. Meir replied. When it is added, from all your filthiness and from all your idols,   [it implies] but not from bastardy. Said R. Jose to him: When it is [further] said, will I cleanse you,   you must say: From bastardy too. ",
            "As for R. Meir, it is well: hence it is written, and the bastard shall dwell in Ashdod.   But according to R. Jose, why ‘and the bastard shall dwell in Ashdod’? — As R. Joseph translated it: The house of Israel shall dwell in security in their land, where [formerly] they were as strangers. ",
            "Rab Judah said in Samuel's name: The halachah agrees with R. Jose. R. Joseph said: Had not Rab Judah ruled in Samuel's name that the halachah is as R. Jose, Elijah would have come and sent entire gangs away from us. "
