            "MISHNAH. IF A MAN DECLARES, ‘THIS SON OF MINE IS A MAMZER,’ HE IS DISBELIEVED. AND EVEN IF BOTH [THE HUSBAND AND WIFE] ADMIT THAT THE CHILD WITHIN HER IS MAMZER, THEY ARE DISBELIEVED. R. JUDAH SAID: THEY ARE BELIEVED. GEMARA. Why [state], EVEN IF BOTH [etc.]? — He leads to a climax. It goes without saying that he [the father], who cannot be certain thereof [is disbelieved]; but even she [the mother], who is certain, is [also] disbelieved. And it goes without saying that they are disbelieved where he [the child] enjoys the presumption of fitness; but even [in the case of] an embryo, who does not enjoy the presumption of fitness, they are [still] disbelieved. R. JUDAH SAID: THEY ARE BELIEVED. As it was taught: He shall acknowledge [the firstborn]: [i.e.,] he shall acknowledge him before others. Hence R. Judah said: A man is believed when he says: ‘This son is my first born.’ And just as he is believed when he says: ‘This son is my firstborn,’ so is he also believed when he says, ‘This is the son of a divorced woman’; ‘this is the son of a Haluzah.’ But the Sages say: He is not believed."
