Through money: Beit Shammai say [this means] a dinar or the equivalent of a dinar. And Beit Hillel say a pruta or an equivalent of a pruta.  How much is a pruta? One eight of an Italian issar. ",

(However,) there (in the verse used in the beraisa to prove that derech is masculine), where war is being referred to [because it is the way of men to make war and not the way of women to make war], (derech is) written as a masculine word.

Rav Bibi once visited Rav Yosef, Once Rav Yosef ate he said to the servants: Remove the ladder from under Bibi. But didn't Rava say: If her husband is in town we do not have to worry? Rav Bibi was different because he and her wife were best friends, and they were intimate.", 
            "Rav Kahana said: If men are in an outer room and women are in an inner room (and the only way to get out is through the outer room), then we do not have to worry about Yichud. But if they are in opposite situations, we learn the opposite.",

            "Rabi Meir would scoff at sinners. One day, the Satan appeared to him as a woman on the opposite side of the river. There was no boats [to cross the river], so he tied a rope to the river bank and [began to] cross. As he approached the halfway point, the Satan left him alone, saying: If it were not [for the fact] that they are decreeing in heaven, \"be careful with Rabi Meir and his Torah, I would have made you worth two Maot (a value of money)\".",

            " Every time Rabbi Chiya bar Abba fell upon his face (in the Tachanun prayer) he used to say, ‘The Merciful save me from the Yetzer Ha'Rah. One day his wife overheard him. ‘Let me see,’ she reflected, ‘it is so many years that he has separated from me: why then should he say that?’ One day, while he was studying in his garden, she adorned herself with a scarf and strolled in front of him.  ‘Who are you?’ he asked. ‘I am Cheruta, and have returned today,’ she replied. He desired her. Said she to him, ‘Bring me that pomegranate from the uppermost branch.’ He jumped up, went, and brought it to her. When he re-entered his house, his wife was firing the oven,whereupon he went and sat in it. ‘What is this?’ she asked. He told her what had happened.‘It was I,’ she told him; but he paid no heed to her until she gave him proof. ‘Nevertheless,’ said he, ‘my intention was evil.’ That righteous man fasted all his life, until he died from that very death."
