            "If he gave ten parts less or more, the terumah is terumah. If, however, his intention was to add even one part more, his terumah is not terumah. How do we know this? And should you answer that it is derived from divorce, [I would respond:] as for divorce, that [may be] because it is a secular matter! The verse says, “You” “Also you [shall set apart a gift unto the Lord of all your tithes]” (Numbers 18:3). This comes to include the agent.",
            "But let Scripture write [it] in respect to terumah, and these [marriage and divorce] would come and be derived from it? Because one can refute [the analogy], since it is possible [to separate terumah] by [mere] thought.  ",

            "One cannot be derived from another: but let one be derived from two [others]?   ",
            "Which one should be thus derived? Let the Torah not state it with respect to sacrifices, and we could derive it from these others? As for these, [it might be argued] that [one may appoint an agent] because they are secular in comparison with sacrifices. Let the Torah not write it in the case of divorce, and we could derive it from the others: As for these, that is because they can be performed with intention.   ",
            "But let the Torah not write it of terumah, and it could be derived from the others!   ",
            "That indeed is so. Then what is the purpose of “you,” “also you”?  It is needed for that which R. Yannai said, for R. Yannai said, “Also you”: just as you are members of the covenant, so must your agents be members of the covenant.",

But a non-Jew, since he is qualified to [separate] terumah from his own [produce], as we learned: If a non-Jew or Samaritan separates terumah, it is valid: I might think that he can also be appointed an agent [for a Jew]; hence it teaches us [otherwise].",
            "Now, according to R. Shimon who exempts [them], as we have taught: The terumah of a non-Jew creates a [forbidden] mixture, and one is liable to an [additional] fifth on its account. But R. Shimon exempts [it], “you” “also you” why do I need it? ",
            "[It is necessary]: Lest I would say that since the Master said: “You,” but not share-croppers; “You” but not partners; “You” but not guardians;  “You” but not one who separates terumah from what is not his, then I might also say, “You” but not your agents. Hence he teaches us [that it is not so].",
            "Now, that goes well according to R. Yehoshua b. Korhah. But according to R. Yonatan, who uses this verse for a different derashah, from where do we [derive agency]? For it was taught: R. Yonatan said: How do we know that all Israel [may] fulfill their obligation "
