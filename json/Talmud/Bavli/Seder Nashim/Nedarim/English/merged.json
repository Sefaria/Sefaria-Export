            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> When an individual takes a vow, he renders an object forbidden to himself or to others as though it were a sacrificial offering; this parallels the act of consecrating an offering, which also renders an item forbidden for personal use by means of a verbal declaration. The most direct expression of a vow is when an individual says: This object is forbidden to me, or to others, like an offering. Additionally, the mishna states that <b>all substitutes</b> for the language <b>of vows are like vows.</b> Consequently, if one states that an object is forbidden to him like a <i>konam</i> instead of like an offering [<i>korban</i>], the vow takes effect, as <i>konam</i> is a substitute term for the word <i>korban</i> (see 10a).",
            "Similarly, substitutes for the language of <b>dedications are like dedications,</b> substitutes for the language of <b>oaths are like oaths, and</b> substitutes for the language of <b>nazirite</b> vows <b>are like nazirite</b> vows. Therefore, if one declared a <i>ḥerekh</i> instead of a dedication [<i>ḥerem</i>], a <i>shevuta</i> instead of an oath [<i>shevua</i>], or proclaimed that he was becoming a <i>nazik</i> instead of a nazirite [<i>nazir</i>], his statement takes effect.",
            "With regard to <b>one who says to another: I am avowed from you,</b> or: <b>I am separated from you,</b> or: <b>I am distanced from you,</b> and he then says: <b>That</b> which <b>I eat</b> of <b>yours,</b> or: <b>That</b> which <b>I taste</b> of <b>yours,</b> even though he did not explicitly state that he is taking a vow or specify the nature of the vow, the object of his vow is nevertheless <b>forbidden.</b> His intention is understood based on his incomplete statement, known as an intimation of a vow, and his vow therefore takes effect.",
            "However, if he says: <b>I am ostracized from you,</b> which does not clearly declare any matter to be prohibited, <b>Rabbi Akiva was uncertain</b> about this <i>halakha</i> but was inclined <b>to rule stringently about this</b> and consider it a vow prohibiting the speaker from deriving benefit from his fellow."

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> It was taught in the mishna that <b>all substitutes</b> for the language <b>of vows are like vows,</b> substitutes for the language of dedications are like dedications, substitutes for the language of oaths are like oaths, and substitutes for the language of nazirite vows are like nazirite vows. The Gemara asks: <b>What is different with regard to</b> the first mishna of tractate <b><i>Nazir</i> that it does not teach all of them,</b> i.e., all of the cases listed above besides nazirite vows, <b>and what is different with regard to</b> the first mishna of tractate <b><i>Nedarim</i> that it teaches all of them</b> and not merely the case of vows, which is the subject directly relevant to this tractate?",
            "The Gemara answers that <b>due to</b> the fact that <b>vows and oaths are written next to each other</b> in the Torah in the verse: “When a man takes a vow to the Lord, or swears an oath” (Numbers 30:3), the mishna <b>teaches</b> these <b>two</b> cases, i.e., substitutes for the language of vows and oaths. <b>And since it taught two</b> of the cases, <b>it taught all of them.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: If so, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>substitutes</b> for the language <b>of oaths</b> immediately <b>after</b> the case of substitutes for the language of <b>vows.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Since it taught</b> the case of <b>vows, whereby an object becomes forbidden to one,</b> it <b>taught also</b> the case of <b>dedications, whereby an object becomes forbidden to one.</b> This is <b>to the exclusion of an oath,</b> whereby <b>one prohibits himself from</b> making use of <b>an object.</b> In the case of an oath, unlike a vow or a dedication, one prohibits himself from performing a particular action rather than declaring an object to be forbidden.",
            "§ The Gemara asks a question with regard to the style of the mishna: The mishna <b>began with</b> the case of <b>substitutes</b> when it stated: <b>All substitutes</b> for the language <b>of vows</b> are like vows, <b>and</b> it then immediately <b>explains</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>intimations</b> of vows, as the next line addresses a case of <b>one who says to his fellow: I am avowed from you. And furthermore,</b> did the <i>tanna</i> <b>forget</b> to mention <b>intimations</b> of vows? Why doesn’t the mishna state that intimations of vows are considered vows before it gives examples of intimations?",
            "The Gemara answers: The mishna <b>is dealing with them,</b> i.e., intimations of vows, <b>and</b> the text of the mishna <b>is incomplete and is teaching the following: All substitutes</b> for the language <b>of vows are like vows, and intimations of vows are like vows.</b> The mishna then continues by giving examples of intimations of vows.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Let</b> the mishna <b>explain</b> the case of <b>substitutes</b> for the language of vows <b>first,</b> i.e., before it gives examples of intimations, just as the basic <i>halakha</i> of substitutes for the language of vows was mentioned first. In fact, it is not until later (10a) that the mishna provides examples of substitutes for the language of vows.",
            "The Gemara answers: The general style of the Mishna is that <b>the</b> subject <b>with which it concludes is the one that it explains first, as</b> in that which <b>we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 20b): <b>With what may one light</b> the Shabbat lamp <b>and with what may one not light</b> it? <b>One may not light</b> with cedar bast, <b>etc.</b> The mishna provides examples of items one may not use to light the Shabbat lamp, which was the concluding phrase of the mishna’s introductory question, rather than beginning with examples of what one may use to light the Shabbat lamp.",
            "Similarly, another mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 47b) states: <b>In what may one insulate</b> a pot of cooked food on Shabbat eve, <b>and in what may one not insulate</b> it? <b>One may not insulate</b> it, <b>etc.</b> A third example of this style is in the following mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 57a): <b>With what</b> items <b>may a woman go out</b> into the public domain on Shabbat <b>and with what</b> items <b>may she not go out? A woman may not go out</b> with strings of wool and other adornments that she may take off and carry.",
            "The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>And</b> is it true that <b>wherever it begins,</b> i.e., whichever topic the mishna mentions first, <b>it does not explain first? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Batra</i> 108a): <b>There are</b> some relatives who <b>inherit and bequeath,</b> e.g., a father and a son, who inherit property from each other, and there are those who <b>inherit but do not bequeath,</b> e.g., a son and his mother; <b>and these</b> are the ones who <b>inherit and bequeath,</b> etc. This mishna provides examples of the opening line of the introductory statement before providing examples of the concluding line of the introductory statement.",
            "Similarly, another mishna (<i>Yevamot</i> 84a) states: <b>There are</b> some women who are <b>permitted to their husbands and forbidden to their <i>yevamin</i>,</b> i.e., their husband’s brothers if their husbands die childless. These cases include one where the <i>yavam</i> is the High Priest, who is prohibited from marrying a widow. There are other women who are <b>permitted to their <i>yevamin</i></b> if their husbands die childless <b>but forbidden to their husbands,</b> e.g., if a High Priest betrothed a widow and his brother is a common priest. The mishna immediately provides the details of the first principle: <b>And these are</b> the women who are <b>permitted to their husbands and forbidden to their <i>yevamin</i>.</b>",
            "Similarly, another mishna (<i>Menaḥot</i> 59a) states with regard to meal-offerings: <b>There are</b> some meal-offerings that <b>require oil and frankincense</b> and some that require <b>oil but not frankincense.</b> The mishna continues: <b>And these</b> are the ones that <b>require oil and frankincense.</b> Yet another mishna (<i>Menaḥot</i> 60a) states: <b>There are</b> meal-offerings that <b>require bringing near,</b> a ritual where the priests were required to carry the offering in their hands and bring it near the altar, <b>and</b> they <b>do not require waving;</b> other meal-offerings require <b>waving but not bringing near. And these</b> are the meal-offerings that <b>require bringing near.</b>",
            "Another mishna (<i>Bekhorot</i> 46a) states: <b>There are</b> some who are considered a <b>firstborn with regard to</b> receiving a double portion of <b>inheritance,</b> as they are the firstborn of their fathers, <b>and</b> they are <b>not</b> considered a <b>firstborn with regard to a priest,</b> i.e., with regard to the mitzva of redemption of the firstborn, which applies only to a woman’s firstborn son. There are others who are considered a <b>firstborn with regard to a priest and are not</b> considered a <b>firstborn with regard to inheritance. And who is</b> considered a <b>firstborn with regard to inheritance</b> who is <b>not a firstborn with regard to a priest?</b> In each of these five cases, the mishna first explains the opening portion of its introductory statement and only then explains the second part of its introductory statement.",
            "The Gemara explains: In <b>these</b> cases, <b>because there are many [<i>avshu</i>]</b> categories, the mishna <b>explains</b> the statement with <b>which it began first.</b> However, when there are only two categories, the mishna first provides detail for the latter part of its opening statement.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Didn’t</b> the mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 51b) state: <b>With what may an animal go out</b> into the public domain on Shabbat <b>and with what may it not go out?</b> This is a case <b>that does not have many</b> categories, <b>and</b> yet the mishna <b>teaches: A camel may go out</b> on Shabbat with an <i>afsar</i>, etc., which clarifies the opening portion of the mishna’s introductory statement."
        ],
        [
            "<b>Rather,</b> the Mishna is <b>not particular</b> with regard to this matter, and there is no consistent pattern. <b>Sometimes it explains first that</b> subject with which <b>it began,</b> and <b>sometimes it explains first that</b> subject <b>with which</b> the introductory line in the mishna <b>finished. And if you wish, say</b> an alternate explanation of the order of the mishna here: With regard to <b>intimations, since they are derived from</b> the <b>exposition</b> of verses and are not explicitly mentioned in the Torah, the <i>tanna</i> cherishes them and <b>explains them first.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: If so, <b>let him begin</b> the mishna <b>with that,</b> i.e., intimations, <b>first.</b> The Gemara answers: The <i>tanna</i> <b>begins with substitutes</b> for the language of vows, which are written <b>in the Torah, in the first clause, and then explains intimations, which are derived from</b> the <b>exposition</b> of verses.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who said</b> that <b>substitutes</b> for the language of vows <b>are</b> terms for vows in a <b>foreign language.</b> Consequently, they may be considered to have been written in the Torah, as vows are certainly valid regardless of the language in which they are expressed. <b>However, according to the one who says</b> that these substitute terms are simply <b>language that the Sages invented</b> for one <b>to</b> use in taking a <b>vow</b> so as to minimize using God’s name in expressing a vow, <b>what can be said?</b> These include novelties just as intimations do.",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>Does</b> the mishna explicitly <b>teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>intimations</b> of vows? <b>Do you not consider it incomplete,</b> missing the phrase that mentions intimations? Once you are inserting this phrase into the mishna, you can <b>also</b> have it <b>precede</b> the clause about substitutes for the language of vows <b>and teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>intimations</b> at the beginning, so that the mishna reads as follows: <b>All intimations of vows are like vows, and all substitutes</b> for the language <b>of vows are like vows. And these are intimations: One who says to his fellow:</b> I am avowed from you, etc. <b>And these are substitutes</b> for the language of vows: <b><i>Konam</i>, <i>konaḥ</i>, <i>konas</i>.</b>",
            "§ Apropos the discussion of intimations of vows, the Gemara asks: <b>And where are intimations</b> of vows <b>written,</b> i.e., from where in the Torah is the <i>halakha</i> of intimations of vows derived? The Gemara explains that it is from the verse: <b>“When a man</b> or a woman <b>shall clearly utter a vow, the vow of a nazirite [<i>nazir</i>], to consecrate [<i>lehazir</i>] himself to the Lord”</b> (Numbers 6:2). <b>And it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the doubled term <b>“<i>nazir lehazir</i>”</b> serves <b>to render substitutes</b> for the language <b>of nazirite</b> vows <b>like nazirite</b> vows, <b>and intimations of nazirite</b> vows <b>like nazirite</b> vows.",
            "<b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> intimations of <b>nazirite</b> vows; <b>from where</b> do I derive intimations of general <b>vows? The verse states: “When a man</b> or woman <b>shall clearly utter a vow, the vow of a nazirite, to consecrate himself to the Lord.”</b> This verse <b>juxtaposes nazirite</b> vows <b>to</b> other <b>vows and</b> other <b>vows to nazirite</b> vows: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>nazirite</b> vows, the verse <b>rendered intimations of nazirite</b> vows <b>like nazirite</b> vows, <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>vows, it rendered intimations of vows like vows.</b>",
            "<b>And just as</b> with regard to <b>vows,</b> one who breaks his vow <b>transgresses</b> the prohibition: <b>He shall not profane</b> (see Numbers 30:3), <b>and</b> if he does not fulfill his vow in time, he transgresses the prohibition: <b>You shall not delay</b> (see Deuteronomy 23:22), <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>nazirite</b> vows, <b>he transgresses</b> the prohibition: <b>He shall not profane, and</b> the prohibition: <b>You shall not delay. And</b> furthermore, <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>vows, a father may nullify the vows of his daughter and a husband may nullify the vows of his wife,</b> as written explicitly in the passage concerning vows (Numbers, chapter 30), <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>nazirite</b> vows, <b>a father may nullify the nazirite</b> vows <b>of his daughter and a husband may nullify the nazirite</b> vows <b>of his wife.</b>",
            "The Gemara questions this explanation: <b>What is different with regard to nazirite</b> vows, with regard to <b>which it is written “<i>nazir lehazir</i>,”</b> using the doubled term, when with regard to all <b>vows as well it is written: “To utter a vow [<i>lindor neder</i>],”</b> also using a doubled term? <b>Why do I</b> need <b>the juxtaposition</b> of all other vows to nazirite vows in order to derive that intimations of vows are like vows, when this can be derived from the doubled term with regard to general vows?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> the Torah <b>had written: A vow to utter [<i>neder lindor</i>], as it wrote</b> with regard to a nazirite: “The vow of <b>a nazirite, to consecrate himself [<i>nazir lehazir</i>],”</b> it would be <b>as you said,</b> and <b>there</b> would be <b>no need for the juxtaposition. Now that it is written: “To utter a vow [<i>lindor neder</i>],”</b> it is possible to say that <b>the Torah spoke in the language of men,</b> and nothing can be derived from the phrase <i>lindor neder</i>, which is simply a common manner of speech.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who holds</b> that <b>the Torah spoke in the language of men, but according to the one who does not hold</b> that <b>the Torah spoke in the language of men,</b> any doubled term comes to teach something. <b>What does he do with this</b> phrase: <b>“To utter a vow [<i>lindor neder</i>]”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He expounds it to render intimations of vows like vows</b> themselves. <b>And</b> the verse <b>juxtaposes nazirite</b> vows <b>to</b> other <b>vows</b> to teach that intimations of vows are like vows with regard to nazirite vows, and to teach the other <i>halakhot</i> mentioned above.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who says that the Torah spoke in the language of men</b> and therefore nothing can be derived from the phrase “to utter a vow [<i>lindor neder</i>],” <b>and he expounds</b> the phrase <b>“the vow of a nazirite to consecrate himself [<i>nazir lehazir</i>]” to render intimations of nazirite</b> vows <b>like nazirite</b> vows, <b>from where does he</b> derive that a term of <b>naziriteship takes effect upon a</b> previously accepted term of <b>naziriteship?

            "The Gemara adds: <b>In the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, they <b>say: There is a <i>tanna</i> who derives intimations</b> of vows <b>from</b> the phrase <b>“to utter a vow [<i>lindor neder</i>],”</b> as he holds that the Torah did not speak in the language of men. <b>And</b> conversely, <b>there is a <i>tanna</i> who</b> holds that the Torah spoke in the language of men, and therefore <b>derives this</b> <i>halakha</i> of intimations <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“He shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth”</b> (Numbers 30:3). The inclusive formulation of this verse comes to include intimations of vows.",

The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, you</b> can <b>find</b> a case <b>where</b> one transgresses the prohibition: <b>He shall not profane, in</b> the case of <b>vows. For example, where one said: I will eat this loaf, and he does not eat it, he violates</b> the prohibition: <b>He shall not profane his word.</b>",

When would he ever become liable for violating the prohibition against profanation? <b>Rava said:</b> The prohibition against profanation serves <b>to render him liable for</b> violating <b>two</b> prohibitions. Consequently, if he eats grapes or drinks wine, he transgresses the relevant prohibition in addition to the prohibition against profanation.",

If he then <b>ate</b> grapes, <b>he is liable for</b> violating the prohibition: <b>He shall not eat.</b> When would he ever become liable for violating the prohibition against delaying?

            "<b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said:</b> The prohibition against delaying applies to a nazirite in a case <b>where one vowed</b> to become a nazirite <b>while he was in a cemetery.</b> Since it is prohibited for a nazirite to be in a cemetery, his term of naziriteship does not come into effect until he leaves the cemetery and ritually purifies himself. If he delays this process, he prevents the vow from taking effect and thereby transgresses the prohibition against delaying.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that if one takes a vow of naziriteship while in a cemetery <b>the naziriteship does not apply to him immediately. However, according to the one who said</b> that the naziriteship <b>applies to him immediately, is there a</b> violation of the prohibition: <b>You shall not delay? And furthermore, didn’t Mar bar Rav Ashi say</b> that all agree that the <b>naziriteship applies to him immediately</b> and he need not repeat his vow of naziriteship when he leaves, <b>and when they disagree</b> it is only <b>with regard to the matter of flogging,</b> and it’s only about this that they <b>disagree,</b> i.e., whether the nazirite is flogged if he drinks wine or otherwise violates the prohibitions of a nazirite.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Even so, he is liable for</b> violating the prohibition: <b>You shall not delay, because</b> by remaining in the cemetery <b>he delays a naziriteship of ritual purity.</b> Although the <i>halakhot</i> of naziriteship take effect upon him immediately, he is still obligated to fulfill a term of naziriteship in a state of ritual purity, and if he delays doing so, he violates the prohibition against delaying. <b>Rav Ashi said: Since this is so, a nazirite who intentionally renders himself ritually impure violates</b> the prohibition: <b>You shall not delay,</b> with regard to <b>a naziriteship of ritual purity,</b> as he thereby prevents himself from completing his naziriteship in a state of ritual purity on time.",
            "<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, stated</b> another explanation of how the prohibition against delaying applies with regard to naziriteship: The nazirite is commanded to shave his hair at the conclusion of his term, and if he causes this shaving to be delayed, <b>he violates</b> the prohibition: <b>You shall not delay,</b> with regard to <b>his shaving.</b>",
            "The Gemara adds: <b>And</b> this explanation <b>is not necessary</b> to say, i.e., it is obvious, <b>according to the one who says</b> that <b>shaving is indispensable</b> for a nazirite and he is subject to all the prohibitions of a nazirite until he shaves, <b>but even according to the one who says</b> that <b>shaving is not indispensable</b> and the <i>halakhot</i> of naziriteship are terminated for him immediately after he brings his offerings, <b>at least</b> it can be said that <b>he does not fulfill the mitzva of shaving</b> until he actually shaves, and therefore if he delays, he violates the prohibition against delaying.",
            "<b>Mar Zutra, son of Rav Mari, stated</b> another explanation of how the prohibition against delaying applies to a nazirite vow: <b>He transgresses</b> the prohibition: <b>You shall not delay,</b> with regard to <b>his offerings.</b> When he completes his term as a nazirite he is obligated to bring certain offerings, and if he delays bringing them, he violates this prohibition.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Is this</b> <i>halakha</i>, that the prohibition against delaying applies to a nazirite vow, <b>derived from here,</b> i.e., the juxtaposition of vows and naziriteship? <b>It is derived from there,</b> a different exposition based upon the verse: “When you shall take a vow…you shall not delay to pay it; for the Lord your God <b>will surely require it</b> of you” (Deuteronomy 23:22). <b>Those</b> items included in the phrase “will surely require it” <b>are sin-offerings and guilt-offerings,</b> including the sin-offering and guilt-offering of a nazirite.",

There is also the case of <b>the sin-offering of forbidden fat,</b> i.e., a typical sin-offering that one brings when he inadvertently violates certain prohibitions, one of which is eating forbidden fat, <b>which one cannot accept through a vow,</b> as only one who has violated the prohibition may bring it; <b>and</b> nevertheless, <b>one</b> still <b>transgresses</b> the prohibition: <b>You shall not delay,</b> if he delays bringing the offering.",

The verse therefore <b>teaches us</b> through the juxtaposition of vows and naziriteship that the prohibition against delaying applies even in this case.",

And furthermore, this novelty is stringent</b> in that it renders the individual a nazirite even if he did not explicitly accept all of the <i>halakhot</i> of naziriteship. How could this novelty indicate that the prohibition against delaying does not apply in this case, which is a leniency, so that the juxtaposition would be necessary?",

            "<b>Another version</b> of Rava’s proof from the mishna is that it may be inferred from the statement: He is liable for only one, that although <b>there is no liability</b> to bring an offering for violating the second oath, <b>there is</b> an effective <b>oath.</b> But if there is no liability, then <b>with regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> is it effective?

            "The Gemara refutes this proof: That mishna may be referring to a case <b>where he accepted upon himself two</b> terms of <b>naziriteship simultaneously.</b> Since two terms cannot be observed concurrently, when he accepts two terms simultaneously, the <i>halakha</i> is that the second term commences immediately following the close of the first, which immediately took effect upon sequential periods of time. However, when one takes an oath prohibiting himself from a matter that is already prohibited by an oath in the same period of time, the second oath may not take effect at all."

            "The Gemara answers that the circumstances are <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who vowed to be a nazirite and violated his naziriteship,</b> the halakhic authority <b>does not attend to him</b> to dissolve his vow <b>until he observes</b> the <b>prohibitions</b> of naziriteship <b>for the same</b> number of <b>days in which he behaved with permissiveness</b> concerning the restrictions of a nazirite.

The Gemara infers: If <b>they did</b> so <b>unwittingly, they are exempt</b> from payment. <b>However,</b> in any event, when <b>they</b> rendered the offering <b><i>piggul</i>,</b> it acquired the status of <b><i>piggul</i></b> and is disqualified.",

            "§ With regard to <b>the</b> matter <b>itself, Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Everyone</b> who brings an offering <b>requires knowledge, except for</b> those offerings brought by <b>those lacking atonement;</b> this can be proven from the fact <b>that a person brings</b> a purification <b>offering for his minor sons and daughters.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>However, if that is so, let a person bring a sin-offering on</b> behalf of <b>another who unwittingly ate</b> forbidden <b>fat</b> without his knowledge, <b>just as a man brings</b> an offering <b>for his wife who is an imbecile, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.

            "The Gemara refutes the analogy between the cases. <b>What are the circumstances of</b> the case of <b>his wife who is an imbecile?

It is clear, therefore, that the sin-offering that one brings for his wife who is an imbecile is not a sin-offering for eating forbidden fat, as that would require halakhic intelligence. It is merely for completion of the purification process, e.g., a woman after childbirth, for which halakhic competence is not required.

If the end of the <b>twelve-month</b> period <b>arrived,</b> even if he has not married her, she <b>partakes of his food,</b> i.e., he is obligated to provide for her. <b>And</b> if she was betrothed to a priest, <b>she partakes of <i>teruma</i></b> like a priest’s wife. <b>However, a man,</b> i.e., a priest, <b>whose married brother died childless [<i>yavam</i>], does not enable</b> the woman awaiting levirate marriage to him <b>to partake of <i>teruma</i></b> until they are actually married.",
            "If the woman <b>completed six months</b> of awaiting marriage <b>under the aegis of the husband,</b> and he died, <b>and</b> then she completed <b>six months under the aegis of the <i>yavam</i>; or even</b> if she <b>completed all of those</b> months <b>under the aegis of the husband, less one day; or all of them under the aegis of the <i>yavam</i> less one day, she may not partake of <i>teruma</i>. This is</b> the <b>initial</b> version of the <b>mishna.</b> However, <b>a court</b> that convened <b>after them,</b> in a later generation, said: <b>The woman may not partake of <i>teruma</i> until she enters the</b> marriage <b>canopy,</b> thereby finalizing the marriage. Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion that her husband can nullify her vows after the completion of the period allotted after the betrothal follows the initial version, which requires the husband to support her from that point forward.",
            "<b>Abaye said to him: Perhaps it is not so. The initial</b> version of the <b>mishna teaches us only about</b> the permissibility of her <b>partaking of <i>teruma</i></b> whose status is <b>by rabbinic law, but</b> with regard to <b>vows,</b> whose prohibitions have the force of <b>Torah law, say</b> that her betrothed <b>cannot</b> nullify them.",
            "<b>And</b> perhaps <b>you did not hear Rabbi Eliezer</b> state his opinion that a betrothed woman is regarded as married <b>only with regard to vows.</b> Perhaps Rabbi Eliezer holds <b>like that</b> which <b>Rav Pineḥas</b> said <b>in the name of Rava, who said: Any</b> woman <b>who takes a vow, takes a vow</b> contingent <b>upon the consent of her husband,</b> since he provides her sustenance. Perhaps Rabbi Eliezer grants her betrothed authority over her vows only because she vows with his consent in mind, since he is now obligated to provide for her. <b>But</b> with regard to <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> Rabbi Eliezer might hold that <b>even</b> if it is <b><i>teruma</i> by rabbinic law, she may not partake</b> of it."

The Gemara explains why it cannot be a full-fledged acquisition where there is more than one <i>yavam</i>: <b>Is there anything</b> like this sort of betrothal that <b>when his brother comes,</b> he <b>can render</b> the betrothed woman <b>forbidden to</b> the one who performed levirate betrothal <b>by</b> engaging in <b>sexual intercourse</b> with the <i>yevama</i>, thereby performing levirate marriage, <b>or by</b> giving her <b>a bill of divorce,</b> thereby disqualifying her from levirate marriage, <b>and</b> nevertheless the betrothed <b>can</b> still <b>nullify</b> her vows? Since this betrothal can in essence be nullified, it cannot be viewed as betrothal with regard to nullification of vows. Rabbi Ami completes his analysis: <b>And Rabbi Akiva holds</b> that the levirate <b>bond is not substantial</b> at all, and there is no marital bond between a <i>yevama</i> and her <i>yavam</i> until the levirate marriage is consummated.",
            "The Gemara challenges Rabbi Ami’s interpretation of the dispute: <b>And according to</b> the <i>amora</i> <b>Rabbi Elazar, who said</b> that <b>levirate betrothal, according to Beit Shammai, does not effect</b> a full-fledged <b>acquisition except</b> in that it <b>removes a rival wife</b> from being considered substantially bound to the <i>yavam</i> while she is a <i>yevama</i>, <b>what can be said?</b> Only the relatives of the betrothed <i>yevama</i> are then forbidden to the <i>yavam</i>.",

This is not the case, as a swallowed object does not become impure when the person who swallowed it does. Therefore the <i>a fortiori</i> argument is flawed, and one cannot derive from the ability to change a status, like the husband’s ability to nullify his wife’s vows or the ability of the ritual bath to render something ritually pure, that the source of the change can also prevent a change of status or preserve that status.",

            "<b>Rava said:</b> The meaning of the affliction in each case may be learned <b>from the context of the verse.

One who abstains from <b>bathing,</b> however, <b>does not know</b> and feel <b>the affliction now,</b> but only later. By contrast, <b>with regard to vows, where it is written: “Every vow and every binding oath to afflict the soul,</b> her husband may uphold it, or her husband may nullify it” (Numbers 30:14), the reference is to <b>a matter that leads to affliction, and if she does not bathe</b> for an extended period of time, <b>it</b> eventually <b>leads to affliction.</b>",
            "§ The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> between this statement <b>of Rabbi Yosei and</b> another statement <b>of Rabbi Yosei.</b> It was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a spring belonging to the residents of a city,</b> if the water was needed for <b>their</b> own <b>lives,</b> i.e., the city’s residents required the spring for drinking water, <b>and</b> it was also needed for <b>the lives of others, their</b> own <b>lives take precedence over the lives of others.</b> Likewise, if the water was needed for <b>their</b> own <b>animals and</b> also for <b>the animals of others, their</b> own <b>animals take precedence over the animals of others.</b> And if the water was needed for <b>their</b> own <b>laundry and</b> also for <b>the laundry of others, their</b> own <b>laundry takes precedence over the laundry of others.</b> However, if the spring water was needed for <b>the lives of others and their</b> own <b>laundry, the lives of others take precedence over their</b> own <b>laundry.</b>",

            "is it <b>not all the more so</b> the case that if one does not bathe, which affects the <b>entire body,</b> Rabbi Yosei would agree that he will suffer pain?

Based on this it may be suggested that according to Rabbi Yosei, soiled clothing presents a greater danger than an unwashed body.",
            "§ With regard to this issue, the Gemara relates that the Sages <b>sent</b> the following message <b>from there,</b> i.e., Eretz Yisrael, to Babylonia: <b>Be careful with regard to grime,</b> as it can lead to disease and sickness. <b>Be careful</b> to learn Torah <b>in the company</b> of others, rather than study it alone.

            "With regard to a similar matter, the Gemara inquires: <b>And for what reason is it not common for Torah scholars to give rise to Torah scholars from among their sons?</b> Why are Torah scholars generally born to paupers, who are not Torah scholars themselves? <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> This is <b>so that they should not say the Torah is their inheritance.</b> Therefore, it is unusual to find that all the sons of a Torah scholar are also Torah scholars. <b>Rav Sheshet, son of Rav Idi, said:</b> This is <b>so that they should not be presumptuous [<i>yitgadderu</i>] toward the community,</b> with the knowledge that they will be Torah scholars like their fathers. <b>Mar Zutra said: Because they</b> take advantage of their fathers’ standing to <b>lord over the community</b> and are punished for their conduct. <b>Rav Ashi said: Because they call</b> ordinary <b>people donkeys.</b>",

            "<b>Rabbi Yishmael said: It says: “But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced</b>…shall be upheld against her” (Numbers 30:10), which means that the practical application of <b>the vow must be in the time of the</b> woman’s <b>widowhood or divorce.</b> Only when the vow is to take effect when she is a widow or a divorcée shall it be upheld against her, since then it is impossible to nullify. <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> by contrast, <b>maintains: It says:</b> “But every vow…<b>with which she has bound her soul,</b> shall be upheld against her,” which means <b>that the binding of the vow,</b> i.e., the taking of the vow creating the prohibition, <b>must be at the time of</b> the woman’s <b>widowhood or divorce.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Ḥisda said: The mishna</b> that links the possibility of nullification to the time of the taking of the vow <b>is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.

By contrast, the <b><i>baraita</i></b> is referring to a woman <b>who made her</b> vow <b>dependent on marriage.</b>",
            "In the case of the <i>baraita</i>, since the woman explicitly connected the application of her vow to her marital status, the possibility of nullifying the vow depends on the time that the vow takes effect. But in the case of the mishna, where the application of the vow is tied to a particular date, it is possible that <b>the days will be completed and she was not divorced,</b> or that <b>the days will be completed and she was not married.</b> Since there is no inherent connection between her marriage and the vow, Rabbi Yishmael agrees that the possibility of nullification depends on the time when the vow was pronounced.",

            "The Gemara concludes with one final incident about <b>a certain adulterer who entered</b> the house <b>of a certain</b> married <b>woman.</b> When <b>the man,</b> i.e., her husband, <b>came</b> home, the <b>adulterer went and sat himself behind the door,</b> so that the husband would not know that he was there. <b>There was</b> some <b>cress [<i>taḥlei</i>] lying there</b> in the house, <b>and</b> the adulterer, but not the husband, saw that <b>a snake</b> had come and <b>tasted of it,</b> perhaps thereby contaminating it with its venom. <b>The master of the house wanted to eat from that cress, without the woman’s knowledge. The adulterer said to him: Do not eat from</b> the cress, <b>as a snake has tasted of it.</b>",
            "The case was brought before <b>Rava,</b> who <b>said: His wife is permitted</b> to him, for <b>were it so that</b> the adulterer <b>had committed a transgression, it would have been preferable for him that</b> the husband should <b>eat</b> the cress <b>and die.</b> This is because one who commits adultery is also suspected of bloodshed, <b>as it is written: “For they have committed adultery and blood is on their hands”</b> (Ezekiel 23:37), indicating that adultery leads to murder.",
            "The Gemara comments: It <b>is obvious</b> that this is the case. What then does Rava come to teach us? The Gemara answers: Rava’s ruling is necessary, <b>lest you say</b> that the man did in fact <b>commit a transgression</b> with the other man’s wife, <b>and</b> the reason <b>that he said to</b> the husband that he should not eat and saved his life is <b>because it is preferable for him that the husband should not die.</b> This is in order <b>that his wife should be to him</b> as it says in the verse: <b>“Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant”</b> (Proverbs 9:17). That is to say, a person derives greater pleasure from forbidden fruit. Rava therefore <b>teaches us</b> that this is not a concern. Rather, the assumption is that he had not yet actually sinned and therefore acted in the proper manner."
