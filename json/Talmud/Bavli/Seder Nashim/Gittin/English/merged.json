            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> An agent <b>who brings a bill of divorce [<i>get</i>]</b> from a husband to his wife <b>from a country overseas,</b> i.e., from outside of Eretz Yisrael to Eretz Yisrael, <b>is required to state</b> the following formula when he hands over the bill of divorce: This bill of divorce <b>was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence.</b>",
            "<b>Rabban Gamliel says: Even one who brings</b> a bill of divorce <b>from Rekem or from Ḥeger,</b> which are on the periphery of Eretz Yisrael, must make this declaration. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Even</b> one who brings a bill of divorce <b>from the village of Ludim to Lod</b> must also make this declaration, despite the fact that these places are only a short distance apart. The reason is that the village of Ludim was not part of the main area settled by Jews in Eretz Yisrael.",
            "<b>And the Rabbis say</b> that <b>one is required to say: It was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence, only</b> if he <b>brings</b> a bill of divorce <b>from a country overseas</b> to Eretz Yisrael, <b>and</b> the same applies to <b>one who delivers</b> a bill of divorce from Eretz Yisrael to a country overseas. <b>And</b> likewise an agent <b>who brings</b> a bill of divorce <b>from</b> one <b>region to</b> another <b>region within</b> the <b>overseas countries is</b> also <b>required to say: It was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> This <i>halakha</i> applies not only to an agent who brings a bill of divorce from one country to another, but <b>even</b> to one who takes it <b>from</b> one <b>district [<i>hegmonya</i>] to</b> another <b>district</b> in the same country.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> With regard to the borders of Eretz Yisrael, <b>from Rekem eastward</b> is considered to be part of the overseas country, <b>and Rekem</b> itself <b>is like east</b> of Eretz Yisrael, i.e., it is outside of Eretz Yisrael. <b>From Ashkelon southward</b> is outside of Eretz Yisrael, <b>and Ashkelon</b> itself <b>is like south</b> of Eretz Yisrael. Likewise, <b>from Akko northward</b> is outside of Eretz Yisrael, <b>and Akko</b> itself <b>is like north</b> of Eretz Yisrael. <b>Rabbi Meir says: Akko is like Eretz Yisrael with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>bills of divorce.</b>",
            "<b>One who brings a bill of divorce</b> from one place to another <b>within Eretz Yisrael is not required to say: It was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence. And if there are those who contest it,</b> i.e., if the husband objects by saying that the bill of divorce is a forgery, <b>it should be ratified through its signatories.</b> The court must authenticate the signatures of the witnesses in order to ratify the document.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that one who brings a bill of divorce from a country overseas to Eretz Yisrael must say: It was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this declaration? <b>Rabba says:</b>"
        ],
        [
            "It is <b>because</b> the people who live overseas <b>are not experts</b> in writing a bill of divorce <b>for her sake.</b> It is not sufficient for a bill of divorce to be written in a technically correct manner. It must also be written for the sake of the man and the woman who are divorcing. Therefore, when the witness comes before the court and says that it was written and signed in his presence, he is testifying that the writing and the signing of the bill of divorce were performed for the sake of the man and woman in question.",
            "<b>Rava says</b> a different reason: It is <b>because there are no witnesses available to ratify it.</b> Since the bill of divorce was written in a distant place, it is possible that the husband, or someone else, might later claim that the bill of divorce is a forgery. For this reason the agent must say that the bill of divorce was written and signed in his presence, a declaration that bars any subsequent objection on the part of the husband.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the difference <b>between</b> these two explanations? The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> a difference <b>between them</b> with regard to a case <b>where two</b> people <b>brought</b> the bill of divorce. In this case, two witnesses are available to ratify the bill of divorce if someone objects to its validity. <b>Alternatively,</b> the difference concerns a case where the agent brings the bill of divorce <b>from</b> one <b>region to</b> another <b>region within Eretz Yisrael.</b> Here there is no concern that the bill of divorce might not have been written for her sake, as the residents of Eretz Yisrael are aware of this requirement. However, witnesses are not necessarily available to confirm the document.",
            "<b>Alternatively,</b> there is a difference between the two explanations in a case where the agent brings the bill of divorce <b>within that</b> same <b>region in a country overseas.</b> According to the opinion of Rabba, who says the concern is that the people there might not know that the document must be written for her sake, this problem is equally relevant in this case. However, according to the opinion of Rava, who says that the reason is because witnesses are not available, if the bill of divorce is brought in the same region then the witnesses will be available to ratify it.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba, who said</b> that the reason is <b>because they are not experts</b> in writing a bill of divorce <b>for her sake, let us require two</b> witnesses to testify about this, <b>just as is</b> the case <b>with regard to all testimonies in the Torah.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>One witness is deemed credible with regard to prohibitions.</b> In other words, if there is uncertainty as to whether a matter is prohibited or permitted, in the case of the heretofore married woman, the testimony of one witness is sufficient.",
            "The Gemara asks: One can <b>say that we say one witness is deemed credible with regard to prohibitions</b> in a case <b>such as</b> where there is <b>a piece</b> of fat, and it is <b>uncertain</b> if it is forbidden <b>fat</b> [<b><i>ḥelev</i></b>] and <b>uncertain</b> if it is permitted <b>fat.</b> In this situation the piece can be rendered permitted by a single witness, <b>as there is no presumption</b> that it is <b>forbidden.</b> Therefore, as there is an uncertainty, and one witness said it is permitted fat, he is deemed credible.",
            "<b>However, here, where there is a presumption</b> that this woman is <b>forbidden, as</b> she is <b>a married woman,</b> a status she retains until it is established that she has received a bill of divorce, if so, this <b>is a matter of forbidden sexual relations, and</b> the general principle is that <b>there is no matter</b> of testimony <b>for forbidden sexual relations</b> that can be attested to by <b>fewer than two</b> witnesses.",
            "The Gemara answers: Rabba’s concern is not equivalent to a case of uncertainty, as <b>most</b> Jewish people <b>are experts</b> in the requirement that a bill of divorce must be written for the woman’s sake. <b>And</b> this is so <b>even according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who is</b> generally <b>concerned about a minority</b> in a matter of forbidden sexual relations. In this case Rabbi Meir concedes that one need not be concerned for the minority, as <b>ordinary judicial scribes,</b> who write bills of divorce, <b>are learned</b> in this <i>halakha</i>, and know that a bill of divorce must be written for the woman’s sake. <b>And it is the Sages who required</b> testimony about this matter, as an extra precaution. <b>And here,</b> with regard to this testimony,"
        ],
        [
            "<b>due to</b> the possibility of <b>desertion,</b> i.e., that she may become like a deserted wife, <b>the Sages were lenient with her</b> by saying that the agent who brought the bill of divorce is deemed credible, despite the fact that he is a single witness. This is to prevent women from becoming uncertain of their marital status as a result of the lack of testimony needed to ratify the bill of divorce.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Is this</b> ruling <b>a leniency? It is a stringency, since if you require two</b> witnesses to testify <b>with regard to</b> the bill of divorce, her <b>husband cannot come</b> to <b>contest and invalidate it,</b> as his testimony will not be accepted against that of the two witnesses. However, if only <b>one</b> agent brings the bill of divorce, the <b>husband</b> can <b>come and contest and invalidate</b> the document.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Since the Master says: In the presence of how many</b> people must the agent who brings the bill of divorce <b>give it to</b> the woman? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Ḥanina</b> disagreed with regard to this issue. <b>One said</b> that he must deliver it to her <b>in the presence of</b> at least <b>two</b> people, <b>and one said</b> that he must deliver it to her <b>in the presence of</b> at least <b>three</b> people, as three individuals are considered a court. Therefore, <b>at the outset</b> the agent is <b>careful</b> to clarify the matter fully, <b>and he will not act to his own detriment</b> by bringing an invalid bill of divorce.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rava, who said</b> that the agent must say: It was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence, <b>because there are no witnesses available to ratify it, let us require two</b> witnesses, <b>just as is</b> the practice with regard to the <b>typical</b> case of <b>ratification of</b> legal <b>documents,</b> which must be performed via two witnesses. The Gemara answers as above: <b>One witness is deemed credible with regard to prohibitions.</b>",
            "Again the Gemara asks: One can <b>say that we say</b> that <b>one witness is deemed credible with regard to prohibitions</b> in a case <b>such as</b> where there is <b>a piece</b> of fat, and it is <b>uncertain</b> if it is forbidden <b>fat</b> and <b>uncertain</b> if it is permitted <b>fat.</b> In this situation, the piece can be permitted by a single witness, <b>as there is no presumption</b> that it is <b>forbidden. However, here there is a presumption</b> that this woman is <b>forbidden as a married woman.</b> If so, this <b>is a matter of forbidden sexual relations, and there is no matter</b> of testimony <b>for forbidden sexual relations</b> that can be attested to by <b>fewer than two</b> witnesses.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>By right</b> it should be <b>that with regard to</b> the <b>ratification of</b> legal <b>documents as well,</b> the court <b>should not require</b> two witnesses, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Reish Lakish. As Reish Lakish says: Witnesses signed on</b> a legal <b>document become like</b> a pair of witnesses <b>whose testimony has been examined in court,</b> and the document should be accepted without further ratification. <b>And it is the Sages who required</b> the court to ratify documents. <b>And here,</b> with regard to bills of divorce, <b>the Rabbis were lenient with her</b> by allowing the document to be ratified through the agent’s testimony alone, <b>due to</b> the possibility of <b>desertion.</b>",
            "The Gemara again asks: <b>Is this</b> ruling <b>a leniency? It is a stringency, since if you require two</b> witnesses to testify <b>with regard to</b> the bill of divorce, then her <b>husband cannot come</b> to <b>contest and invalidate it,</b> whereas if there is only <b>one</b> agent, her <b>husband can come and contest and invalidate it.</b> Once again the Gemara answers: <b>Since the Master says: In the presence of how many</b> people must the agent who brings the bill of divorce <b>give it to</b> the woman? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Ḥanina</b> disagreed with regard to this issue. <b>One said</b> that he must deliver it to her <b>in the presence of</b> at least <b>two</b> people, <b>and one said</b> that he must deliver it to her <b>in the presence of</b> at least <b>three</b> people, as three individuals are considered a court. Therefore, <b>at the outset</b> the agent is <b>careful</b> to clarify the matter fully, <b>and he will not act to his own detriment</b> by bringing an invalid bill of divorce.",
            "After clarifying the basic dispute, the Gemara discusses the reasons for each opinion. <b>And</b> as for <b>Rava, what is the reason</b> that <b>he did not say like Rabba,</b> that the reason the agent must declare: It was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence, is due to the concern that the bill of divorce was not written for the woman’s sake? The Gemara answers that Rava could have <b>said to you: Is</b> it <b>taught</b> in the mishna that the agent must say: <b>It was written in my presence for her sake,</b> and <b>it was signed in my presence for her sake?</b> Since the agent does not testify that it was written for her sake, this indicates that the Sages did not institute the requirement that he state this declaration to ensure that it was written for her sake.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabba</b> respond to this claim? The Gemara answers: <b>By right</b> it is so <b>that</b> the mishna should <b>teach</b> in <b>this</b> manner. <b>However,</b> the Sages did not require him to say this, <b>as if you increase</b> the agent’s requirement to <b>speak,</b> by obligating him to state this lengthy declaration, <b>he will</b> likely <b>come to shorten it.</b> If he has too much to remember, he might forget some of the formula, and his error will render the bill of divorce invalid.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Now too,</b> with regard to the formula as it stands, <b>he will come to shorten it</b> by omitting either it was written in my presence or it was signed in my presence. The Gemara answers: He is likely to <b>shorten</b> it by omitting <b>one</b> term out <b>of three,</b> such as: For her sake, from the three-term clause: It was written, in my presence, for her sake. However, <b>he will not shorten</b> his declaration by omitting <b>one</b> term <b>of two.</b> Consequently, when asked if it was written in his presence, he will answer with the full statement, and the same is true when he is asked if it was signed in his presence.",
            "The Gemara asks concerning the other opinion: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabba, what is the reason</b> that <b>he did not say like Rava,</b> that the reason for the decree is because witnesses may not be available to ratify the bill of divorce? The Gemara answers that Rabba could have <b>said to you: If so, let</b> the mishna <b>teach: It was signed in my presence, and nothing more,</b> as this is a confirmation that the signatures of the witnesses on the document are valid. <b>Why do I</b> need the agent to add: <b>It was written in my presence? Conclude from it</b> that the reason for this decree is because <b>we need</b> the bill of divorce to be written <b>for her sake.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rava</b> respond to this claim? The Gemara answers: Rava would answer that <b>by right</b> it is so <b>that</b> the mishna should <b>teach</b> in <b>this</b> manner. <b>But if</b> this were to be <b>so,</b> that the agent declares merely: It was signed in my presence, people <b>will come to confuse</b> the matter <b>with the typical</b> case of <b>ratification of</b> legal <b>documents.</b> In other words, they will think it is possible to ratify other documents via the testimony <b>of one witness.</b> Consequently, the Sages added that the agent must also declare: It was written in my presence, which is not generally stated with regard to the confirmation of other documents.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>And Rabba</b> would respond as follows: There is no concern that people will confuse the ratification of a bill of divorce with the typical case of the ratification of legal documents, as <b>are</b> the two cases <b>comparable</b> at all? <b>There,</b> with regard to the ratification of other documents, the witnesses need only say: <b>We know</b> that these are the signatures of the witnesses on the document. By contrast, <b>here,</b> in the case of a bill of divorce, the agent must say: It was signed <b>in my presence.</b>",
            "Additionally, <b>there,</b> in the case of other documents, <b>a woman is not deemed credible,</b> whereas <b>here, a woman is deemed credible</b> when she brings a bill of divorce and declares that it was written and signed in her presence. Additionally, <b>there,</b> in the case of other documents, <b>an interested party is not deemed credible</b> to testify concerning the validity of the document. However, <b>here, an interested party is deemed credible,</b> as even the woman herself can bring her bill of divorce and testify that it was drafted in the correct manner.",
            "<b>And Rava,</b> how would he respond to this claim? He could have <b>said to you: Is that to say</b> that <b>here,</b> in the case of a bill of divorce, <b>if</b> the witnesses of ratification <b>say: We know, they are not deemed credible?</b> They would be deemed credible even if they used that formula. <b>And since when</b> they <b>say: We know, they are deemed credible,</b> people <b>will come to confuse it with the typical</b> case of <b>ratification of</b> legal <b>documents,</b> which they will perform <b>via one witness.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba, who said</b> that the reason for the declaration: It was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence, is <b>because they are not experts</b> in writing a bill of divorce <b>for her sake, who is this <i>tanna</i> who requires</b> that the <b>writing</b> of the bill of divorce must be performed <b>for her sake, and</b> also <b>requires</b>"
        ],
        [
            "that the <b>signing</b> must be performed <b>for her sake? If</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> he <b>requires signing</b> for her sake; however, <b>he does not require</b> that the <b>writing</b> must be for her sake. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (21b): <b>One may not write</b> a bill of divorce <b>on</b> anything that is <b>attached to the ground,</b> e.g., a leaf attached to a tree. However, if <b>he wrote it on</b> something that is <b>attached to the ground,</b> and then he <b>detached it, signed it, and gave it to her,</b> it is <b>valid.</b> This indicates that the essential stage of writing a bill of divorce is when it is signed by witnesses. The Gemara says that this is Rabbi Meir’s opinion, as an unattributed ruling in the mishna typically follows the opinion of Rabbi Meir.",
            "<b>If</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar,</b> who disagrees with Rabbi Meir and <b>requires</b> that the <b>writing</b> must be for her sake, <b>he does not require</b> that the <b>signing</b> must be for her sake. <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>actually</b> the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, and when Rabbi Elazar does not require signing for her sake,</b> he means <b>by Torah law,</b> whereas <b>by rabbinic law he requires</b> that bills of divorce must be signed for her sake; <b>but</b> that is untenable, as the Sages listed <b>three bills of divorce</b> that are valid by Torah law but are <b>invalid by rabbinic law, and</b> when he disputes that ruling <b>Rabbi Elazar does not require</b> that the <b>signing</b> must be <b>for her sake.</b>",
            "<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (86a): <b>Three bills of divorce</b> are <b>invalid</b> <i>ab initio</i>, <b>but if</b> the woman <b>married</b> another man after having received one of these bills of divorce <b>the offspring</b> is of <b>unflawed</b> lineage. In other words, she is not considered to be a married woman who engaged in sexual intercourse with another man, which would render their child as one born from an adulterous relationship [<i>mamzer</i>]. And these three are: A bill of divorce that the husband <b>wrote in his handwriting but there are no</b> signatures of <b>witnesses on</b> the document; and if <b>there are</b> the signatures of <b>witnesses on</b> the document <b>but there is no date</b> written <b>on it;</b> and if <b>there is a date</b> written <b>on it but it has only one witness</b> signed on it. <b>These are</b> the <b>three invalid bills of divorce</b> concerning which the Sages said: <b>And if she married, the offspring</b> is of <b>unflawed</b> lineage.",
            "The mishna continues: <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Even though there are no</b> signatures of <b>witnesses on</b> the document, <b>but he gave it to her in the presence of</b> two <b>witnesses,</b> it is <b>a valid</b> bill of divorce. <b>And</b> on the basis of this bill of divorce the woman <b>can collect</b> the amount written to her in her marriage contract even <b>from liened property, as</b> Rabbi Elazar maintains <b>that witnesses sign the bill of divorce only for the betterment of the world.</b> If no witnesses sign a bill of divorce the husband could contest its validity at any time by denying that he wrote it. In any case, it can be seen from this mishna that according to Rabbi Elazar the signatures of the witnesses are not an essential part of a bill of divorce. Consequently, it does not need to be signed for her sake, even by rabbinic law.",
            "<b>But rather,</b> you can say that the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, and when Rabbi Meir does not require</b> that the <b>writing</b> must be <b>for her sake,</b> he meant <b>by Torah law,</b> whereas <b>by rabbinic law he does require</b> that the writing must be for her sake. However, the Gemara raises a difficulty against this explanation as well: <b>But didn’t Rav Naḥman say</b> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say:</b> A bill of divorce need not be written for her sake, and <b>even</b> if a husband <b>found</b> a bill of divorce <b>in the garbage,</b> and the names of the man and woman in the bill of divorce are the same as his name and that of his wife,"
        ],
        [
            "<b>and he signed it and gave it to</b> his wife, it is <b>a valid</b> bill of divorce? <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>we learned</b> that <b>this</b> statement of Rav Naḥman applies <b>by Torah law,</b> whereas by rabbinic law Rabbi Meir concedes that a bill of divorce must be written for her sake, <b>if so,</b> Rav Naḥman <b>should have</b> said: <b>Rabbi Meir would say</b> that <b>by Torah law</b> if a husband found a document in the garbage he may use it.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara retracts the previous answer and states: <b>Actually,</b> the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, and when does Rabbi Elazar not require</b> that the <b>signing</b> must be for her sake? <b>Where there are no witnesses at all</b> on the bill of divorce. However, <b>where there are witnesses, he does require</b> that all their signatures must be for her sake. The proof for this is <b>that Rabbi Abba says: Rabbi Elazar concedes with regard to</b> a document whose <b>falsification is inherent in it,</b> i.e., a document that is signed by disqualified witnesses, <b>that it is invalid.</b> This shows that although Rabbi Elazar maintains that a lack of signatures does not invalidate a bill of divorce, all signatures included in the bill of divorce must be valid; otherwise the document is rendered invalid.",
            "<b>Rav Ashi said</b> a different explanation: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with a third opinion, that of <b>Rabbi Yehuda. As we learned</b> in a mishna (21b): <b>Rabbi Yehuda invalidates</b> a bill of divorce <b>unless its writing and signing</b> are performed <b>on</b> an item that is <b>detached</b> from the ground. According to this opinion, both the writing and the signing must be done for her sake.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And initially, what is the reason we did not establish</b> the mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda?</b> Since Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion is explicitly stated in a mishna, isn’t it obvious that this mishna also follows his ruling?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>We seek</b> to explain the mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> as there is a general principle <b>that</b> a ruling in <b>an unattributed mishna</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir.</b> Likewise, <b>we seek</b> to interpret the mishna in accordance with the ruling of <b>Rabbi Elazar, as we maintain</b> in general that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with his</b> opinion <b>with regard to bills of divorce.</b> For these reasons, the Gemara first attempted to interpret the mishna in accordance with the opinion of one of these <i>tanna’im</i>, not that of Rabbi Yehuda.",
            "§ The Gemara continues to explain the mishna in light of the dispute between Rabba and Rava. <b>We learned</b> in the mishna that <b>Rabban Gamliel says: Even one who brings</b> a bill of divorce <b>from Rekem or from Ḥeger</b> must say: It was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Even</b> one who brings a bill of divorce <b>from the village of Ludim to Lod. And Abaye said</b> in explanation of this matter: <b>We are dealing with towns</b> that are not part of the land itself, but <b>are near Eretz Yisrael and within the boundary of Eretz Yisrael.</b>",
            "<b>And Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: I myself saw that place,</b> i.e., the distance between the village of Ludim and Lod, <b>and it was similar</b> to the distance <b>from Bei Kuvei to Pumbedita,</b> which is only a short distance.",
            "The Gemara analyzes the mishna: One can derive <b>by inference that the first <i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna <b>holds</b> that in <b>these</b> places the agent <b>is not required</b> to testify that the bill of divorce was written and signed for the woman’s sake. <b>What, is it not</b> the case that <b>they disagree with regard to this</b> principle, <b>as</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>holds</b> that the reason for saying: It was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence, is <b>because</b> people living overseas <b>are not experts</b> in writing a bill of divorce <b>for her sake, and</b> the residents of <b>these</b> places <b>are learned</b> in this matter, as they are near Eretz Yisrael. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabban Gamliel, <b>holds:</b> The reason is <b>because there are no witnesses available to ratify it, and</b> the residents of <b>these</b> places <b>are also not frequently</b> available, as they live on the other side of the border, and it is difficult to bring witnesses from one place to another.",
            "The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No,</b> there is no proof that this issue is a dispute among <i>tanna’im</i>, as <b>Rabba resolves</b> the different opinions in the mishna according <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, and Rava resolves</b> them according <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>Rabba resolves</b> them according <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as everyone</b> agrees that the reason is <b>because they are not experts</b> in writing a bill of divorce <b>for her sake. And here they disagree with regard to this</b> issue: <b>The first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>since</b> the residents of <b>these</b> cities <b>are</b> located <b>near</b> Eretz Yisrael, they <b>are</b> assumed to be <b>learned</b> in this <i>halakha</i>.",
            "<b>And Rabban Gamliel came to say:</b> Granted, the residents of those cities that <b>are within</b> the boundary of Eretz Yisrael <b>are learned</b> in this <i>halakha</i>, however, the residents of these cities that are only <b>near</b> Eretz Yisrael <b>are not learned. And Rabbi Eliezer came to say,</b> when he mentioned the village of Ludim and the town of Lod, that the residents of those cities that <b>are within</b> the boundary of Eretz Yisrael are <b>also not</b> treated as learned, so <b>that you should not make a distinction within</b> separate areas of <b>the country overseas.</b> In other words, anywhere that is not part of the Jewish settlement of Eretz Yisrael is classified as outside, even if they are familiar with the <i>halakhot</i> of bills of divorce.",
            "Likewise, <b>Rava resolves</b> the various opinions in the mishna according <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning.</b> He maintains <b>that everyone</b> agrees that the reason for the declaration: It was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence, is <b>because there are no witnesses available to ratify it. And the first <i>tanna</i> holds: Since</b> the residents of <b>these</b> cities <b>are nearby</b> they <b>are frequently</b> available.",

            "<b>and these</b> people <b>are learned</b> with regard to this <i>halakha</i>, as a bill of divorce sent from Eretz Yisrael was certainly written in the correct manner. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the Rabbis, <b>holds:</b> The reason for the testimony is <b>because there are no witnesses available to ratify it, and these</b> witnesses who travel from Eretz Yisrael overseas <b>are also not frequently</b> available.",
            "The Gemara again rejects the suggestion: One cannot prove that this issue is a dispute of the <i>tanna’im</i>, as <b>Rabba resolves</b> the different opinions in the mishna according <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, and Rava resolves</b> them according <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning. Rabba resolves</b> them according <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning,</b> as follows: It may be <b>that everyone</b> agrees that the reason is <b>because they are not experts</b> in writing a bill of divorce <b>for her sake, and here they disagree with regard to a decree</b> applied in the case of <b>one who delivers</b> a bill of divorce to Eretz Yisrael <b>due to</b> the concern that it will be confused with the case of <b>one who brings</b> a bill of divorce from Eretz Yisrael.",
            "The Gemara explains <b>that the first <i>tanna</i> holds:</b> The Sages <b>do not decree</b> with regard to <b>one who delivers due to one who brings.</b> In other words, although one who delivers a bill of divorce from overseas to Eretz Yisrael must say: It was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence, one who brings a bill of divorce from Eretz Yisrael to a country overseas need not state this declaration.",
            "<b>And the later Rabbis hold:</b> The Sages <b>do decree</b> with regard to <b>one who delivers due to one who brings</b> the bill of divorce from overseas. The reason for this decree is that one might err and think that just as an agent who delivers a bill of divorce from Eretz Yisrael to a country overseas is not required to testify that it was written and signed in his presence, so too, one who brings a bill of divorce from a country overseas to Eretz Yisrael need not state this declaration. Consequently, the Sages decreed that even one who delivers a bill of divorce from Eretz Yisrael to a country overseas must declare: It was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence.",
            "<b>And Rava</b> also <b>resolves</b> the different opinions in the mishna according <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning.</b> How so? He maintains <b>that everyone</b> agrees that the reason for the declaration: It was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence, is <b>because there are no witnesses available to ratify it, and the later Rabbis</b> do not disagree with the previous opinion. Rather, <b>they come to explain the reasoning of the first <i>tanna</i>.</b> In other words, the first <i>tanna</i> agrees that one who takes a bill of divorce from Eretz Yisrael to a country overseas must state the declaration, and he simply taught the <i>halakha</i> in a concise manner.",
            "§ The Gemara attempts to cite another proof: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>One who brings</b> a bill of divorce <b>from one region to</b> another <b>region within a country overseas must</b> also <b>say: It was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>But</b> if he brought a bill of divorce <b>within</b> one <b>region in a country overseas he is not required</b> to state this declaration. This <b>works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rava,</b> as witnesses are available in the same region. However, <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba,</b> the matter is <b>difficult,</b> as overseas residents are not experts in the <i>halakha</i> and therefore it does not matter how closely they are located to each other.",
            "The Gemara answers: According to the opinion of Rabba, <b>do not say</b> that the correct inference is: <b>Within</b> one <b>region in a country overseas, he is not required</b> to state the declaration. <b>Rather, say</b> that one should infer from the mishna: <b>From region to region within Eretz Yisrael, he is not required</b> to do so.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to this answer: <b>But</b> that <i>halakha</i> need not be derived by inference, as the mishna <b>is teaching it explicitly: One who brings a bill of divorce</b> from one place to another <b>within Eretz Yisrael is not required to say: It was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> this <i>halakha</i> were to be derived <b>from that</b> statement alone, <b>I would say: This applies</b> only <b>after the fact,</b> i.e., if someone acted in this manner then the bill of divorce is not invalidated. <b>However,</b> it might have been thought that one should <b>not</b> act in this manner <b><i>ab initio</i>;</b> rather, the agent should state the declaration. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> by means of this inference from its first section that he need not state the declaration even <i>ab initio</i>.",
            "The Gemara offers an alternate version of this discussion: <b>And some raise</b> this <b>objection like this,</b> by inferring differently from that ruling of the mishna. The mishna teaches: One who brings a bill of divorce from one region to another region within a country overseas must also say: It was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence. The Gemara infers from here that if he brings the document <b>from region to region within Eretz Yisrael, he is not required</b> to state the declaration.",
            "This <b>works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba,</b> as the residents of Eretz Yisrael are aware of the <i>halakha</i> that a bill of divorce must be written for the woman’s sake. However, it is <b>difficult according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rava.</b> The Gemara rejects this inference: <b>Do not say</b> that the mishna is teaching that <b>from</b> one <b>region to</b> another <b>region within Eretz Yisrael, he is not required. Rather, say: Within</b> one <b>region in a country overseas he is not required</b> to state the declaration.",
            "The Gemara questions this interpretation: <b>However,</b> if that is so, with regard to an agent who brings a bill of divorce <b>from region to region within Eretz Yisrael, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is <b>he required</b> to state the declaration? If so, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> simply: <b>One who brings</b> a bill of divorce <b>from</b> one <b>region to</b> another <b>region</b> must state the declaration, <b>without specification,</b> and this would apply both overseas and in Eretz Yisrael.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> one who brings <b>from region to region within Eretz Yisrael is also not required</b> to state the declaration even according to the opinion of Rava, for the following reason: <b>Since there are</b> those <b>who ascend</b> to Jerusalem <b>for the pilgrimage Festival,</b> witnesses <b>are frequently</b> available and they can come even from one region to another.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: This <b>works out well when the Temple is standing,</b> as there are those who ascend to Jerusalem for the pilgrimage Festival at that time. However, <b>when the Temple is not standing what can be said?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Since there are</b> central <b>courts that are fixed</b> in a permanent location where everyone goes, witnesses <b>are frequently</b> available to ratify the bill of divorce.",
            "The Gemara suggests a different proof: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says</b> that <b>even</b> an agent who brings a bill of divorce <b>from</b> one <b>district to</b> another <b>district</b> must say that it was written and signed in his presence. <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak said: There was one city in Eretz Yisrael, and Asasiyyot was its name, and it contained two districts that</b> divided the city.

            "The Gemara comments: This <b>works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rava,</b> who holds that the reason is due to witnesses, as the witnesses could not pass from one district to another. However, it is <b>difficult according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba,</b> as he maintains that there is no need to state the declaration in Eretz Yisrael because its residents are aware of the <i>halakha</i> that a bill of divorce must be written for the woman’s sake. The Gemara answers: <b>Rabba is of</b> the opinion that the reason is also in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rava,</b> i.e., Rabba agrees that one of the reasons for this <i>halakha</i> is because witnesses are not available to ratify the bill of divorce. He adds another reason, that they are not experts in the <i>halakha</i> of writing the document for her sake.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, what</b> then <b>is</b> the difference <b>between them,</b> i.e., between Rava’s explanation and that of Rabba? The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> a difference <b>between them</b> with regard to a case <b>where two</b> people <b>bring</b> the bill of divorce from a country overseas. According to the opinion of Rava they do not need to say: It was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence, as additional witnesses are not needed to confirm this bill of divorce. However, it is still necessary to declare that the document was written for the sake of the wife.",
            "<b>Alternatively,</b> the difference between the two explanations involves a case where one agent brought the bill of divorce from one place to another <b>within</b> a single <b>region in a country overseas,</b> where witnesses are available to ratify it.

He should return, <b>take</b> the bill of divorce <b>from her, and again give it to her in the presence of two</b> witnesses, <b>and he should say: It was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence.</b> Although the dispute in this <i>baraita</i> is referring to a different issue, it mentions incidentally that the document must be transmitted in the presence of two people, not three.",
            "After citing the <i>baraita</i> the Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Meir,</b> does he maintain that merely <b>because</b> the agent <b>did not say: It was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence,</b> the second husband <b>must divorce</b> her <b>and the offspring is a <i>mamzer</i>?</b> Is the <i>halakha</i> so strict that the divorce is invalidated even if the witness actually saw the writing and signing of the bill of divorce, and simply neglected to state the declaration?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> as <b>Rabbi Meir</b> conforms <b>to his</b> own line of <b>reasoning</b> with regard to this issue. <b>As Rav Hamnuna said in the name of Ulla: Rabbi Meir would say</b> that in <b>any</b> case where <b>one who deviates from the formula coined by the Sages with regard to bills of divorce,</b> and the woman married despite this, the second husband <b>must divorce</b> the woman who married him on the basis of that bill of divorce, <b>and the offspring is a <i>mamzer</i>.</b>",
            "§ The Gemara relates: <b>Bar Haddaya sought to bring a bill of divorce</b> from one country to another. <b>He came before Rabbi Aḥai, who was appointed over bills of divorce</b> in his location to ask him how to proceed. Rabbi Aḥai <b>said to him: You are required to stand over each and every letter</b> when the scribe writes the bill of divorce, to see that everything is performed in the correct manner. Bar Haddaya <b>came before Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi</b> to ask if this is required, and <b>they said to him: You are not required</b> to do this; rather, it is enough for you to be present and oversee in general that it is done in the proper manner.",
            "<b>And if you would say: I will act stringently,</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Aḥai, then <b>you are casting aspersions on the earlier bills of divorce,</b> i.e., bills of divorce written in previous generations, as the agents who delivered them did not examine them to this extent.",
            "The Gemara further relates: <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana brought a bill of divorce, half</b> of which <b>was written in his presence and half</b> of which <b>was not written in his presence. He came before Rabbi Elazar</b> to clarify the <i>halakha</i> in this case. Rabbi Elazar <b>said to him: Even</b> if the scribe <b>wrote only one line of it for her sake</b> in the presence of the agent, <b>he is no longer required</b> to observe further, as it can be assumed that he wrote all of it for her sake. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b>"

            "The Gemara notes: If <b>he</b> was <b>in the house and the scribe</b> was <b>in the loft, he does not see him</b> at all. <b>Rather, is it not</b> correct to say that the <i>baraita</i> is speaking about a case <b>where he heard the sound of the quill and the sound of the scroll?</b> This is a proof which supports the statement of Rav Ashi.",

The Gemara asks: This <i>halakha</i> <b>is obvious,</b> as <b>would we render</b> the bill of divorce <b>invalid</b> merely <b>because he</b> was <b>entering and exiting?</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach the <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where</b> the scribe <b>exited</b> the house <b>to</b> go to <b>the market and returned</b> to continue writing the bill of divorce. <b>Lest you say</b> that perhaps while he was in the market <b>another person found him and told him</b> to write a bill of divorce on his behalf, and he is now writing a bill of divorce for the sake of a woman other than the one for which he was writing it at the outset, the <i>baraita</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that this possibility is disregarded and the bill of divorce is valid.",

Therefore there is a concern that one might deliver this bill of divorce in the presence of those witnesses, who are actually gentiles, which would render the bill of divorce invalid.",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us also decree</b> in <b>a place where Jews do not sign due to a place where Jews do sign.</b> The Gemara answers: One might <b>confuse</b> one <b>name with</b> another <b>name.</b> It is possible that one might think that a certain name is that of a Jew when it is actually that of a gentile. However, one is <b>not</b> likely to <b>confuse</b> one <b>place with</b> another <b>place.</b> Since everyone knows that all of the signatures in certain places belong to gentiles, they are careful not to transfer a bill of divorce in the presence of the witnesses who signed it, unless they are certain that the witnesses are Jews.",
            "§ The Gemara relates that <b>Ravina thought to deem valid</b> a document that was written <b>by a group of gentiles [<i>arma’ei</i>]. Rafram said to him</b> that <b>we learned:</b> Gentile <b>courts,</b> in the mishna, i.e., these documents are valid only if they were produced in an important court, not by every group of gentiles.",
            "Similarly, <b>Rava said:</b> With regard to <b>this Persian document [<i>shetara parsa’a</i>]</b> written by the Persian authorities <b>that was transferred to</b> the recipient <b>in the presence of Jewish witnesses,</b> he <b>can collect with it non-liened</b> property, i.e., property that is unencumbered by a mortgage. Although this is not considered a proper document by means of which one can collect from any land sold by the debtor, nevertheless, the facts in the document are considered accurate, and therefore one may at least collect non-liened property with it.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> the witnesses for the transmission of this document <b>do not know</b> how <b>to read</b> Persian, as most Jews did not read that language. If so, how can they serve as witnesses? The Gemara answers: Rava is referring to a situation <b>where</b> the witnesses <b>know</b> how to read Persian.",
            "The Gemara questions how the court can rely upon such a document: <b>But I require</b> that the document be <b>written</b> in a manner <b>that cannot be forged, and it is not</b> so in this document, as the Persians were not particular about preparing their documents in this manner when writing their legal documents. The Gemara explains: Rava’s statement applies <b>in</b> a case where the paper of the documents was processed <b>with gall.</b> Consequently, it is not possible to forge the writing (see 19b). <b>But I require that</b> a document <b>review the</b> essential <b>topic of the document in its last line, and it is not</b> so in the case of Persian documents. The Gemara answers: Rava’s statement applies <b>in</b> a case <b>where it returned</b> to review the essential topic of the document in the final line.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> he should be able to collect <b>from liened</b> property <b>as well,</b> as this document is equivalent to one written by a Jew. Why doesn’t Rava say that it can be used to collect from liened property as well? The Gemara answers: The reason is that this document does <b>not</b> generate <b>publicity,</b> i.e., a legal matter that is performed in a Persian court will not become publicized among Jews. Therefore, this case is similar to a loan by oral agreement, where the transaction is not publicized. In this case the lender can collect only from non-liened property, as purchasers from the debtor would not have been aware of his debt and consequently taken sufficient measures to ensure that the money would not be claimed from their purchase.",

            "With regard to <b>witnesses who signed a bill of divorce and whose names are like the names of gentiles, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?

            "The Gemara infers: <b>And</b> this applies <b>specifically</b> to names such as <b>Lukos and Los, as it is uncommon</b> to find <b>Jews who are called by these names. However,</b> with regard to <b>other</b> gentile <b>names,</b> concerning <b>which it is common</b> to find <b>Jews who are called by these names, no,</b> the documents are not valid, as people might mistakenly rely on the signatures of gentiles.",
            "Reish Lakish <b>raised an objection to</b> this ruling from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 4:8): With regard to <b>bills of divorce that come from a country overseas, and witnesses are signed upon them, even though the names</b> of the witnesses <b>are like the names of gentiles, they are valid, because the names of most Jews outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>are like the names of gentiles.</b> This indicates that a bill of divorce is valid even when the names are not clearly those of gentiles.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>There</b> the <i>halakha</i> is different, <b>as it teaches the reason</b> explicitly: <b>Because the names of most Jews outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>are like the names of gentiles.</b> Consequently, it can be assumed that the court examined the matter at the time of the signing, and that the document was signed by Jews. However, in Eretz Yisrael it is more likely that ambiguous names are actually those of gentiles, and therefore a document of this kind is valid only when it is clear it was signed by gentiles, to avoid mistakes.",
            "This was one version of the discussion. <b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that Reish Lakish <b>asked</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan about the very <b>same</b> case as <b>in the <i>baraita</i>, and he resolved</b> the matter <b>for him from the <i>baraita</i>,</b> that even if the names signed on a bill of divorce brought from outside of Eretz Yisrael are like the names of gentiles, they are valid.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who says</b> to another: <b>Give this bill of divorce to my wife, or:</b> Give <b>this bill of manumission to my slave, if</b> before the document reaches the woman or the slave the giver <b>wishes to retract</b> his decision, then <b>with regard to both of them, he can retract.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>",
            "<b>And the Rabbis say:</b> One can retract his decision <b>in</b> the case of <b>bills of divorce but not in</b> the case of bills <b>of manumission.</b> The Rabbis explain the reason for their ruling: This is <b>because one can act in a person’s interest in his absence,</b> and therefore the agent acquires the document on behalf of the slave from the moment the owner hands the bill of manumission to the agent. <b>But one can act to a person’s detriment only in his presence.</b> The receipt of a bill of divorce is considered to be to a woman’s detriment, and therefore an agent cannot receive it for her without her consent.",
            "They explain further: The emancipation of a slave is in his interests, despite the fact that he receives sustenance from his master while a slave, <b>as, if</b> the master <b>wishes not to sustain his slave he is allowed</b> not to provide him with sustenance. This demonstrates that slavery is not in the interest of the slave, as he does not receive any guaranteed benefit. <b>But</b> if a husband wishes <b>not to sustain his wife, he is not allowed</b> to proceed in this manner. Consequently, marriage is in the interests of the woman.",
            "Rabbi Meir <b>said to</b> the Rabbis: <b>But</b> even so, it is not in the interest of a slave to be emancipated, <b>as,</b> if his master is a priest, he <b>disqualifies his slave from</b> partaking of <b><i>teruma</i></b> by emancipating him, <b>just as</b> a husband who is a priest <b>disqualifies his</b> Israelite <b>wife</b> from partaking of <i>teruma</i> by divorcing her. The Rabbis <b>said to him:</b> It is permitted for a priest’s slave to partake of <i>teruma</i> not because he has a right to sustenance, but rather <b>because he is his</b> master’s <b>acquisition.</b>",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Huna and Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef were sitting before Rabbi Yirmeya, and Rabbi Yirmeya was sitting and dozing</b> while the other two Sages conversed. <b>And Rav Huna was sitting and saying:</b> With regard to the statement <b>of the Rabbis</b> that a master cannot retract a bill of manumission once he has given it to an agent, one can <b>conclude from</b> it <b>that</b> if a third party <b>seizes</b> a debtor’s property <b>on behalf of a creditor,</b> an act that is certainly in the interests of the creditor, he <b>acquires</b> this property on his behalf. This is similar to the case here, where the agent acquires the bill of manumission on behalf of the slave.",
            "<b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef said to</b> Rav Huna: Do you state this <i>halakha</i> <b>even in a case when</b> the seizure of property <b>is to the detriment of others,</b> e.g., if there are other creditors who would lose the opportunity to seize the property? Rav Huna <b>said to him: Yes.</b>",
            "<b>In the meantime Rabbi Yirmeya woke up, due to their</b> conversation, as he was not sleeping deeply. <b>He said to them: Children [<i>dardekei</i>], this is</b> what <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: One who seizes</b> property on behalf <b>of a creditor in a case where it is to the detriment of others does not acquire.

            "Rabbi Yirmeya elaborates: The reason for the ruling in the mishna is that <b>anyone who says: Give</b> to so-and-so, <b>is like one who says: Acquire</b> on behalf of so-and-so. Since the master said: Give this bill of manumission to my slave, the agent immediately acquires it on the slave’s behalf, despite the fact that the bill is to the detriment of the master. However, this <i>halakha</i> has no bearing on a case where a person independently seizes property on behalf of another, and by doing so acts to the disadvantage of others.",
            "<b>Rav Ḥisda says:</b> With regard to this issue of <b>one who seizes</b> property <b>on behalf of a creditor in a case where it is to the detriment of others, we have arrived at the dispute between Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis.</b> What is this dispute? <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Pe’a</i> 4:9): With regard to <b>one who</b> is not poor but <b>collected produce in the corner of the field, which is given to the poor [<i>pe’a</i>], and said: This</b> produce that I have collected is <b>for so-and-so,</b> who is <b>a poor person, Rabbi Eliezer said: He has acquired</b> it <b>on his behalf, and the Rabbis say:</b> He has not acquired it on his behalf; rather, <b>he gives</b> the produce he gathered <b>to</b> whichever <b>poor person appears first</b> before him. Apparently, Rabbi Eliezer holds that one can gather <i>pe’a</i> on behalf of a poor person, despite the fact that he acts to the detriment of other paupers, while the Rabbis disagree.",
            "<b>Ameimar said, and some say</b> that it was actually <b>Rav Pappa</b> who said:"
        ],
        [
            "<b>Perhaps</b> that <b>is not so.</b> Perhaps this is not the point of dispute between Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis. There are two ways to explain why this might not be the case. First, it is possible that <b>Rabbi Eliezer states his opinion only there,</b> when the person took possession of the <i>pe’a</i> despite not being eligible to collect it for himself, <b>since if</b> the one who collected the produce <b>desired, he</b> could <b>declare his property ownerless and become a poor person, and</b> then the produce would have been <b>fit for him</b> to retain for himself. <b>And since</b> he could have <b>acquired</b> the <i>pe’a</i> <b>for himself,</b> he can likewise <b>acquire</b> it <b>for another</b> as well. <b>However, here,</b> where he seizes property on behalf of a creditor, he cannot seize this property for himself. Consequently, Rabbi Eliezer does <b>not</b> rule that he can do so when it is against the interests of another person.",
            "Second, one can argue from the opposite perspective: <b>The Rabbis state</b> their opinion <b>only there,</b> that one cannot acquire on behalf of the poor person, <b>as it is written:</b> “The corner of your field you shall not reap and the gleaning of your harvest <b>you shall not gather; for the poor</b> you shall leave them” (Leviticus 23:22), and the Sages expounded this verse by reading it as though there were no break in the middle: <b>You shall not gather for the poor,</b> i.e., the poor person must collect the produce for himself. <b>However, here,</b> where one seizes property on behalf of a creditor, this verse does not apply, and therefore the Rabbis did <b>not</b> rule that the action of the third party is ineffective. Consequently, it is possible that the dispute between Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis is not with regard to the issue of whether one can seize property on behalf of a creditor in a case where it is to the detriment of others.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> with regard to <b>this</b> verse: <b>“You shall not gather,” what does he do with it?</b> How does he interpret this phrase, from which the Rabbis derived that one may not collect <i>pe’a</i> on behalf of a poor person? The Gemara answers: <b>He requires it to warn a poor person with regard to his own</b> field, i.e., if a poor person had a field of his own he is not permitted to gather <i>pe’a</i> from it for himself, his poverty notwithstanding.",
            "§ The mishna taught: <b>As, if</b> the master <b>wishes not to sustain</b> his slave he is allowed to act accordingly. The Gemara comments: <b>Conclude from</b> the mishna that <b>the master is</b> legally <b>able to say to</b> his <b>slave: Work for me but I will not sustain you.</b>",
            "The Gemara rejects this claim: This is not a conclusive proof, as <b>with what are we dealing here,</b> in the mishna? We are dealing with a case <b>where he said to</b> the slave: <b>Spend your earnings to sustain yourself.</b> In other words, I will not provide for you; rather, you must work and earn money for your sustenance on your own. However, this does not mean that a master can force his slave to work for him without providing him with sustenance.",
            "The Gemara asks: If so, <b>in the corresponding</b> situation in the mishna <b>with regard to a wife,</b> will one explain <b>that he</b> could have <b>said to her: Spend your earnings to sustain yourself?</b> The mishna rules that one cannot exempt himself from his obligation to provide sustenance for his wife. In the case of <b>a wife, why</b> may he <b>not</b> do so? It is certainly permitted for a husband to stipulate with his wife that she will keep her earnings and not receive sustenance from him, yet it is clear in the mishna that there is a difference between a slave and a wife with regard to his ability to refuse to provide sustenance. The Gemara answers: The <b>wife</b> mentioned in the mishna is one whose earnings <b>are not sufficient</b> for her sustenance, and in that case the husband may not stipulate in this manner.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: If so, the case of the <b>slave also</b> is referring to a situation where his earnings <b>are not sufficient</b> for his sustenance, and he is unable to sustain himself. Nevertheless, his master can refuse to sustain him. Therefore, one can conclude from the mishna that a master can say to his slave: Work for me but I will not sustain you. The Gemara explains: <b>A slave who is not worth the bread that he consumes, for what is he needed by his master or his mistress?</b> If the value of his labor does not even pay for the cost of his sustenance why is he needed at all? The mishna certainly does not refer to a case of this kind. By contrast, with regard to a wife, the marriage does not depend on her ability to provide for herself by means of her earnings. Consequently, one cannot prove from the mishna that a master can say to his slave: Work for me but I will not sustain you.",
            "The Gemara suggests another proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Makkot</i> 2:8): With regard to <b>a slave who</b> unintentionally killed someone and <b>was exiled to</b> one of the <b>cities of refuge, his master is not required to sustain him. And not only that, but his earnings</b> in his city of refuge belong <b>to his master. Conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that <b>a master can say to</b> his <b>slave: Work for me but I will not sustain you,</b> as in the case of a slave exiled to a city of refuge the master is entitled to his earnings despite not providing for him. The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> With a case <b>where</b> the master <b>said to him: Spend your earnings to sustain yourself.</b>",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so,</b> if the master said this to the slave, then <b>why do his earnings</b> belong <b>to his master?</b> After all, his master stipulated that he should sustain himself. The Gemara answers: This <i>halakha</i> is referring <b>to</b> his <b>surplus</b> earnings, i.e., if the slave works and earns more than the cost of his sustenance, his surplus income belongs to the master.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t</b> it <b>obvious</b> that any <b>surplus</b> belongs to the master, as he owns the slave? The Gemara answers: This ruling is necessary, <b>lest you say that since, when he does not</b> work enough the master does <b>not give him</b> all he needs to eat, then <b>when he has</b> a surplus from his work the master <b>should also not take it.</b> Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that despite this consideration the surplus belongs to the master.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And what is different</b> with regard to a slave who was exiled <b>to</b> one of the <b>cities of refuge,</b> concerning whom the <i>baraita</i> was stated? According to this reasoning, the surplus should belong to the master no matter where the slave is located. The Gemara answers: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that as the verse states with regard to one who is exiled to a city of refuge: “And that fleeing to one of these cities <b>he might live”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:42), one should <b>act for him</b> so that he has <b>extra life,</b> i.e., in this specific case the slave should be allowed to retain any additional amount he earns. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that no special obligation of this kind applies even if the slave had been exiled to a city of refuge.",
            "The Gemara raises another difficulty: <b>But from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause</b> of that <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches: However,</b> with regard to <b>a woman who was exiled to</b> one of the <b>cities of refuge, her husband is obligated in her sustenance, by inference</b> the <i>baraita</i> is dealing with a case <b>where he did not say to her:</b> Spend your earnings to sustain yourself, which is why he must sustain her. <b>As, if he said</b> this <b>to her, why is her husband obligated</b> to provide her with sustenance?",
            "<b>And from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> is speaking about a case <b>where he did not say</b> this <b>to her,</b> it may be inferred that the <b>first clause</b> is <b>also</b> dealing with a situation <b>where he did not say to</b> the slave: Spend your earnings to sustain yourself. The two clauses of the <i>baraita</i> must be referring to similar cases or they would not be taught together.",
            "The Gemara rejects this claim: <b>Actually,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the master <b>said to</b> the slave: Spend your earnings to sustain yourself, and the husband issued a similar statement to his wife. However, in the case of <b>a woman</b> it is referring to a situation <b>when</b> her earnings are <b>not sufficient</b> for her sustenance.",
            "The Gemara raises an objection: <b>But from</b> the fact <b>that the last clause teaches: And if</b> the husband <b>said to her: Spend your earnings to sustain yourself, he is permitted</b> to act accordingly, <b>it may be inferred that the first</b> half of the last <b>clause</b> is referring to a case <b>where he did not say</b> this <b>to her.</b> The Gemara explains that <b>this is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: And if</b> her earnings <b>suffice</b> to pay for her sustenance, <b>and he said to her: Spend your earnings to sustain yourself, it is permitted</b> for him to say that.",
            "The Gemara asks: If the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case where her earnings <b>suffice, what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> this <i>halakha</i> with regard to one who was exiled to a city of refuge? The same <i>halakha</i> applies to all wives. The Gemara answers: It is necessary, <b>lest you say</b> that in light of the verse: <b>“All glorious is the king’s daughter within the palace”</b> (Psalms 45:14), from which it is derived that it is improper for a wife to spend too much time outside her home, this woman’s husband should be concerned that while his wife is in a city of refuge she should not work out of the home, but only in the home. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that there is no need to be concerned about this matter, and her husband may say to her: Spend your earnings to sustain yourself, even in a city of refuge.",
            "With regard to the question of whether a master can decide to cease providing sustenance for his slave while the slave continues to serve him, the Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that this matter is the <b>subject of</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it was taught that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: A slave can say to his master in years of famine: Either sustain me</b> from your property <b>or emancipate me.

            "<b>What, is it not</b> correct to say that <b>they disagree</b> about <b>this</b> issue, <b>that</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that a master <b>can</b> say to his slave that he should work for him and he will not sustain him. Consequently, he is not required to emancipate him even when he cannot provide for him. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, <b>holds</b> that the master <b>cannot</b> say this, and therefore he is required to free him.",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>And can you understand</b> the dispute that way? If so, <b>this</b> expression: <b>Either sustain me or emancipate me,</b> is inaccurate, as the <i>baraita</i> <b>should have</b> said: <b>Either sustain me or give me my earnings for my sustenance. And furthermore,</b> if the dispute concerns this general issue, <b>what is different about years of famine?</b> The same dispute should apply in all years.",
            "<b>Rather, with what are we dealing here?</b> This <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case where the master <b>said to</b> the slave: <b>Spend your earnings to sustain yourself, and</b> subsequently, <b>during years of famine,</b> the slave’s earnings do <b>not suffice</b> to provide himself with sustenance, as prices are higher than usual.",
            "And <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds</b> that in this case the slave can say to his master: <b>Either sustain me or emancipate me, so that people will see me</b> in my helpless state, <b>and they will have mercy on me</b> and provide me with charity. <b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that this is not a justification for emancipating a slave, as <b>those who have mercy on freemen will also have mercy on a slave.</b> Consequently, it is not necessary for the slave to be emancipated for him to receive help from generous people. According to this interpretation, the <i>baraita</i> has no bearing on the question as to whether a master can say to his slave: Work for me but I will not sustain you.",
            "The Gemara offers another suggestion: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a statement <b>that Rav said:</b> In the case of <b>one who consecrates the hands of his slave,</b> so that all the work he does becomes Temple property, preventing the slave from working on his own behalf, then <b>that slave borrows and eats, and</b> afterward <b>performs</b> work <b>and repays</b> what he borrowed, as will be explained. <b>Conclude from</b> Rav’s statement that <b>the master is able to say to</b> his <b>slave: Work for me but I will not sustain you.</b> In this case the master has prevented his slave from working for himself, and yet he is not required to provide for him.",

        [
            "<b>does he</b> find it necessary to <b>borrow and eat?</b> After all, his master provides for him. The Gemara answers: This is referring <b>to surplus</b> food, i.e., additional food that the slave wants to eat.",

The agents <b>said to them: No;</b> we do not want to do this. <b>They said to them:</b> If so, <b>return</b> the vessel <b>to us,</b> as we do not wish to transfer it in such a manner that we retain responsibility.",
            "<b>Rabbi Dostai, son of Rabbi Yannai, said to them: Yes,</b> I am willing to return it. However, <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Keifar said to them: No,</b> as you do not have the right to retract in this situation. <b>They tormented</b> Rabbi Yosei bar Keifar to force him to agree to return the vessel.

            "§ The Gemara discusses the meaning of the expression: Deliver, in relation to a gift. With regard to one who said to his agent: <b>Deliver one hundred dinars to so-and-so, and</b> the agent <b>went and searched</b> for that person <b>but did not find him,</b> as he had died, it <b>is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i>: The money <b>should be returned to the sender. And it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: The money should be given <b>to the heirs of the one to whom it was sent.</b>",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that they disagree about this, as</b> one <b>Sage,</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, <b>holds</b> that in the case of a gift, saying: <b>Deliver, is like</b> saying: <b>Acquire,</b> and consequently the agent took possession of the money on behalf of the one to whom it was sent. Therefore, the heirs inherit this item. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, <b>holds</b> that in the case of a gift, saying: <b>Deliver, is not like</b> saying: <b>Acquire,</b> and therefore the agent must return the money to the sender.",
            "<b>Rabbi Abba bar Memel said:</b> No; <b>everyone agrees</b> that in the case of a gift, saying: <b>Deliver, is not like</b> saying: <b>Acquire, and</b> the apparent contradiction between the two <i>baraitot</i> is <b>not difficult: This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which says that the agent must return the money to the sender, is dealing <b>with</b> a case where the giver was <b>a healthy person</b> when he issued the instructions. Such a gift is acquired by the recipient only once it reaches his possession, and this recipient died before the gift reached him. Conversely, <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i>, which says that he should give it to the heirs of the one to whom it was sent, deals <b>with</b> the instructions of a person <b>on his deathbed.</b> Since the gift of a dying person is immediately acquired by the recipient, this recipient acquired it straightaway, and therefore it must be given to his heirs.",
            "<b>Rav Zevid said:</b> It is possible to say that saying: Deliver, is not like saying: Acquire, and that both <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> <i>baraita</i> are dealing <b>with</b> a case where the giver was a person <b>on his deathbed.</b> Instead, the difference between the two sources is that <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i>, which states that he should give it to the recipient’s heirs, is referring to a case <b>where the recipient was</b> alive <b>at the time of the giving of the money.</b> Consequently, when the sender gives the money to the agent the recipient immediately acquires it, and his heirs claim it in his stead. <b>That</b> <i>baraita</i>, which says that the agent must return the money to the sender, is referring to a case <b>where the recipient was not</b> alive <b>at the time of the giving of the money,</b> and consequently the agent could not acquire the money on his behalf.",
            "<b>Rav Pappa said</b> yet another explanation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> <i>baraita</i> are both dealing <b>with a healthy person</b> who subsequently died. The difference is that <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i>, which said that the agent must return the money to the sender, is dealing with a case <b>where the recipient died in the lifetime of the giver,</b> and as he did not acquire the money himself his heirs do not take possession of it either. By contrast, <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i>, which states that the money should be given to the heirs of the recipient, is dealing with a case <b>where the giver died in the lifetime of the recipient.</b> Once he dies it is a mitzva to fulfill his wishes, and therefore the recipient, and his heirs after him, are entitled to the money.",
            "The Gemara further suggests: <b>Shall we say</b> that the issue of whether saying: <b>Deliver, is like</b> saying: <b>Acquire, is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>?</b> This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, that if one person said to another: <b>Deliver one hundred dinars to so-and-so, and he went and searched for him but did not find him,</b> as he had died, the money <b>should be returned to the sender.</b> If <b>the sender died, Rabbi Natan and Rabbi Ya’akov said:</b> The money <b>should be returned to the heirs of the sender. And some say:</b> It should be given to <b>the heirs of the one to whom it was sent.</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi said in the name of Rabbi Ya’akov, who said</b> this <b>in the name of Rabbi Meir: It is a mitzva to fulfill the statement of the dead.</b> Therefore the money should be given to the heirs of the one to whom it was sent. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> Due to the uncertainty, <b>they should divide</b> it. <b>And here,</b> in Babylonia, <b>they said: Whatever the agent wishes to do he may do. Rabbi Shimon HaNasi said:</b> When <b>an incident</b> of this kind occurred <b>under my</b> jurisdiction I inquired into how to proceed, <b>and</b> the Sages <b>said</b> to me: The money <b>should be returned to the heirs of the sender.</b>",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>What, is it not</b> correct to say that <b>they disagree about this</b> issue, <b>that the first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that saying: <b>Deliver, is not like</b> saying: <b>Acquire,</b> and therefore the money should be returned to the sender? <b>And Rabbi Natan and Rabbi Ya’akov also</b> hold that saying: <b>Deliver, is not like</b> saying: <b>Acquire, but</b> they add that <b>even though</b> the sender <b>died, one does not say: It is a mitzva to fulfill the statement of the dead.</b> Consequently, the money is returned to the sender’s heirs. <b>And</b> the Sages in the clause beginning: <b>Some say,</b> claim that saying: <b>Deliver, is like</b> saying: <b>Acquire.</b> Therefore the recipient takes possession of the money immediately, and it is given to his heirs.",
            "And <b>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi,</b> who <b>said in the name of Rabbi Ya’akov, who said</b> this <b>in the name of Rabbi Meir,</b> also holds that saying: <b>Deliver, is not like</b> saying: <b>Acquire.

            "The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No;</b> it is possible that <b>in</b> a case where the giver was <b>a healthy person</b> when he appointed the agent <b>everyone agrees</b> that saying: Deliver, is not like saying: Acquire, <b>and with what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a person <b>on his deathbed</b> who sent these one hundred dinars, <b>and they disagree in the dispute between Rabbi Elazar and the Rabbis.</b>",
            "This is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Batra</i> 156a): With regard to <b>one who divides his property orally, Rabbi Elazar says: Both</b> in the case of <b>a healthy person and</b> that of <b>a dangerously ill person, property that serves as a guarantee,</b> i.e., land, <b>is acquired by</b> means of <b>money, through a document, or by taking possession.

Rabbi Elazar meant that it is not possible to bring a proof from this incident, as these sons were wicked people. Consequently, when dealing with them the Sages did not act in accordance with the <i>halakha</i>, but allowed their mother to give this valuable piece of jewelry to their sister, circumventing the <i>halakhot</i> of inheritance.",
            "The Gemara states: <b>The first <i>tanna</i></b> holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar,</b> who holds that there must be an actual act of acquisition or the money still belongs to the giver. <b>And Rabbi Natan and Rabbi Ya’akov also</b> hold <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar.</b> However, they add that <b>even though</b> the giver <b>died one does not say: It is a mitzva to fulfill the statement of the dead.

This is because it is a stylistic feature of the Mishna to teach a less novel case followed by a more novel one, regardless of the fact that had it taught the more novel case first, there would have been no need to mention the less novel case at all. Therefore, there is no need to infer a special, unstated novelty from this clause at all, which means it cannot be cited as proof against Rav Ḥisda’s greater novelty.",

When one washes the second half of his hand, some moisture remains on the portion of his hand that he already washed, and therefore one might think that this liquid joins with the water with which he washes the second half of his hand.",

They also do not connect for purity, e.g., if two collections of water are attached via the pouring of a stream, they do not join together to form the amount of water necessary to form a valid ritual bath, through which people and items can become ritually pure. If so, liquid that rendered a hand moist should not serve to attach the two halves of one’s hand when they are washed.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> this dilemma is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where there is</b> liquid that rendered an item <b>moist</b> enough <b>to render</b> another item <b>moist.</b> In other words, the half of the hand that was washed is not merely slightly moist, it is moist enough to render something else moist. The Gemara asks: <b>We</b> already <b>learned this as well:</b> With regard to liquid that rendered an item <b>moist</b> enough <b>to render</b> another item <b>moist,</b> it <b>connects</b> with other liquid.

            "If they immersed <b>sequentially,</b> then the <b>first</b> person is <b>ritually pure,</b> as he immersed in a ritual bath that contains the requisite amount of water, <b>but the second</b> person is <b>impure,</b> because some of the water must certainly have clung to the first individual as he left the ritual bath. Consequently, after the first person’s immersion the ritual bath contained slightly less than the requisite forty <i>se’a</i> of water.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: If</b> the <b>first</b> person’s <b>feet were</b> still <b>touching the water</b> in the ritual bath when the second person immersed, then <b>the second</b> person is <b>also ritually pure.</b> According to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, the water left on the body of the person who has immersed connects with the water in the ritual bath to constitute the requisite amount of water. Clearly, in Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion, liquid that rendered an item moist enough to render another item moist joins together with other liquid. However, this <i>halakha</i> was stated only with regard to a ritual bath. It remains unclear whether liquid that rendered an item moist enough to render another item moist joins with the water used to wash the second half of one’s hand. Perhaps this is the dilemma raised by Ilfa.",
            "The Gemara cites another question with regard to this issue. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya says: They said</b> in a mishna (<i>Zavim</i> 5:12): In the case of <b>one whose head and most of his</b> body <b>enter</b> into <b>drawn water</b> after he immersed himself in a ritual bath to purify himself, <b>and a ritually pure person</b> concerning <b>whom three <i>log</i></b> of <b>drawn water fell on his head and most of his</b> body, both of these people are <b>ritually impure.</b> With regard to this mishna, <b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma:</b> If <b>half of</b> a person became purified <b>by entering</b> into drawn water <b>and half of him</b> became purified <b>by</b> having water <b>fall</b> on him, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Do these acts join together to render him ritually impure or not? No answer is found, and therefore the Gemara says that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.",

She is therefore within her rights to collect these monies from the date written in the bill of divorce, even if it was given at a later date. <b>However, according to Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who holds that the reason for writing the date is to prevent the husband from shielding his wife from punishment for her infidelity, <b>what is the reason that Rabbi Shimon deems</b> it <b>valid?</b> There is still a concern that he will have the bill of divorce written and dated earlier in order to protect her.",

Here, their opinions are the opposite of the way the Gemara explained earlier.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Reverse</b> the opinions in this final dispute so that it is Reish Lakish who holds that the rights to the produce revert to the woman at the time of writing and it is Rabbi Yoḥanan who holds that it is at the time of giving the divorce.",

One of the three bills of divorce listed is a bill of divorce that does not have a date. Abaye asks: Being that the divorce does take effect, <b>what did the Sages accomplish with their ordinance</b> requiring that the date appear on a bill of divorce? Either way the bill of divorce is valid after the fact without a date. The Gemara answers: <b>It is effective</b> in <b>that she may not marry <i>ab initio</i></b> as a result of receiving this bill of divorce, which consequently limits the usage of such a bill of divorce.",
            "Abaye continued to ask of Rav Yosef: If the husband <b>cut out its date</b> after the dated bill of divorce was written <b>and gave it to her, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? May the bill of divorce be used <i>ab initio</i>? <b>He said to him: We are not concerned about a deceiver.</b> The ordinance requiring that the bill of divorce be dated does not apply in this case, as it was dated when it was written.",
            "Abaye continued and asked: If the date <b>written in</b> the bill of divorce made reference only to the <b>seven-</b>year Sabbatical cycle in which it was written, or only to the <b>year,</b> or only to the <b>month,</b> or only to the <b>week,</b> but the precise date was not recorded, then <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? May such a bill of divorce be used <i>ab initio</i>? <b>He said to him:</b> It is <b>valid</b> to be used <i>ab initio</i>. Abaye asked him: If so, <b>what did the Sages accomplish with their ordinance</b> requiring the dating of the bill of divorce? Regardless of the reason for recording the date, such vague dating will not ameliorate the problem.",
            "Rav Yosef answered: <b>It helps for the seven-year period before it and the seven-year period after it.</b> If witnesses testify that the woman committed adultery before this seven-year period, then she is liable; if the husband sells produce after this seven-year period, then the woman can recover it. The reason for this is <b>because if you do not say so,</b> i.e., that a limited benefit is enough to justify the ordinance, then on that <b>day itself, do we know if</b> it was written <b>in the morning or in the evening?</b> All of the issues that were mentioned before could apply also to that day itself. <b>Rather,</b> the date is effective <b>for the day before it and the day after it.

            "§ The Sages decreed that it is prohibited for a woman to remarry within three months of her divorce or her becoming a widow, in order to prevent a situation of doubt concerning the paternity of a child. <b>It was stated: From when</b> does one begin <b>counting</b> the three months <b>with regard to a bill of divorce?

            "It <b>is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel</b> that the count begins from the time of the writing: In the case of <b>one who</b> is about to travel and <b>deposits a bill of divorce for his wife</b> with a trustee <b>and says to him: Give it to her only after three months, once he gives it to her, she is permitted to marry immediately</b> and is not required to wait an additional three months. <b>And one need not</b> be <b>concerned that</b> it is <b>an outdated bill of divorce, as he was not secluded with her</b> in the interim.",
            "It is told that <b>Rav Kahana and Rav Pappi and Rav Ashi would in practice</b> count three months <b>from the time of</b> the <b>writing,</b> but <b>Rav Pappa and Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, would in practice</b> count these three months <b>from the time of</b> the <b>giving.

            "§ The Gemara discusses another dispute between Rav and Shmuel with regard to documents. According to the terms of a marriage contract, a widow is entitled to payment of its value upon the death of her husband. By Torah law, all outstanding debts are canceled at the close of the Sabbatical Year. A woman need not take her marriage settlement as soon as her husband dies. The issue at hand is at what point the marriage contract generates a concrete debt that will be canceled by the Sabbatical Year. <b>It was stated: From when</b> is the debt established by <b>a marriage contract canceled</b> in the Sabbatical Year?",
            "<b>Rav says:</b> The marriage contract becomes like a debt and will be canceled in the Sabbatical Year <b>from</b> the time <b>when</b> the woman <b>collects partial payment and establishes</b> the rest as a debt in court. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> This occurs when <b>she</b> either <b>collects partial payment although she did not establish</b> it as debt, or <b>she established</b> the entire value of the marriage contract as a debt in court <b>although she did not collect partial payment.</b>",
            "With regard to this dispute, it <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav,</b> and it <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel.</b> It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav: From when is</b> the debt established by <b>a marriage contract canceled? From when she accepts partial payment and establishes</b> the rest as a debt in court. However, if <b>she accepted partial payment but did not establish</b> the debt, or <b>established</b> the debt <b>but did not accept partial payment,</b> then <b>it is not canceled until she accepts partial payment and establishes</b> the debt.",
            "It <b>is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel:</b> If the fine and damages paid by one who commits <b>rape; or</b> the <b>fine</b> paid by one who falsely claims his wife was not a virgin at the time of their wedding; <b>or</b> the fine paid for <b>seduction; or</b> the debt established by <b>a woman’s marriage contract was established as a loan,</b> then the Sabbatical Year <b>cancels it. And if</b> one did <b>not</b> establish these payments as loans, then the Sabbatical Year <b>does not cancel them. From when</b> is it considered that these payments <b>have been established as a loan? From the time of standing trial,</b> because the abstract obligation to pay becomes a debt once the court ruled that one is required to pay.",
            "§ The Gemara discusses other aspects of the marriage contract. <b>Shmuel said: A marriage contract is</b> considered to be <b>like a court enactment. Just as court enactments may be written during the day and</b> then <b>signed at night,</b> and the fact that the writing and signing were not performed on the same day does not present a problem, <b>so too, a marriage contract may be written during the day and</b> then <b>signed at night.</b> It is told: <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Rav’s marriage contract was written during the day and</b> then <b>signed at night,</b> and <b>Rav was there and he did not say anything to</b> the people who wrote and signed it. This indicates that Rav agrees with the ruling of Shmuel.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel?</b> The Gemara rejects this: This cannot be proven from here because the scribe and witnesses <b>were</b> continuously <b>engaged in that matter</b> of writing the marriage contract, from when it was written in the day until they signed it at night, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Elazar bar Rabbi Tzadok said:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that a document written during the day and signed at night is invalid <b>only when</b> the scribe and witnesses <b>were not</b> continuously <b>engaged in that matter, but</b> if they <b>were</b> continuously <b>engaged in that matter</b> until nightfall, then it is <b>valid.</b>",
            "§ The mishna taught that <b>Rabbi Shimon deems valid</b> a bill of divorce written during the day and signed at night. <b>Rava said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon?</b> He <b>holds</b> that <b>once</b> the husband <b>has decided to divorce her, he no longer has</b> the rights to <b>the produce</b> from his wife’s property, and it is clear that he has decided to divorce her when he writes a bill of divorce.

There is no concern that he appeased her because <b>if it is so</b> that <b>he appeased</b> her, then <b>the matter</b> becomes <b>public knowledge,</b> and all would hear of it.",
            "§ <b>It was stated</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish disagreed with regard to the following case: If the husband <b>says to ten</b> men: <b>Write a bill of divorce for my wife, Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> He means that all of them should sign the bill of divorce. <b>Two</b> of them function <b>as witnesses, and all</b> the rest <b>of them</b> sign the bill of divorce only <b>due to</b> the <b>stipulation</b> that the husband had stated.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> in which all of them have to sign? <b>If we say</b> that <b>he did not say to them: All of you,</b> but just said to them: You should write a bill of divorce for my wife, <b>didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (66b) that if <b>one said to ten</b> people: <b>Write a bill of divorce for my wife,</b> then <b>one</b> would <b>write, and two</b> would <b>sign,</b> and not all ten of them are required to sign. <b>Rather,</b> the case of their dispute is <b>when he said to them: All of you</b> write a bill of divorce for my wife, and in this instance is was taught later on in that mishna that one person writes the bill of divorce and everyone else must sign it.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the difference <b>between</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish; what is the difference if the rest of the men function as witnesses or just in order to fulfill the man’s stipulation? The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> a difference <b>between them</b> in a case <b>where two of them signed on that day and the rest</b> signed not on the day it was written but <b>from now until ten days</b> later. According to <b>the one who says</b> that the other signatures are <b>due to the stipulation,</b> the bill of divorce is <b>valid,</b> because two witnesses signed the bill of divorce on the same day that it was written, and the stipulation was also fulfilled. <b>And</b> according to <b>the one who says</b> that all these people sign <b>due to</b> his wish that they all function as <b>witnesses,</b> it is <b>invalid</b> because not all the witnesses signed the bill of divorce on the day it was written.",
            "<b>Alternatively,</b> there is another difference between them, in a case <b>where one of these</b> ten people <b>is found</b> to be <b>a relative</b> of the husband or wife, <b>or</b> is otherwise found to be <b>disqualified</b> to serve as a witness. <b>According to the one who says</b> that the other signatures are <b>due to the stipulation,</b> this bill of divorce is <b>valid</b> because the disqualified person did not serve as a witness.

            "The Gemara adds another point of dispute: According to Rabbi Yoḥanan, who holds that the other witnesses sign due to the husband’s stipulation, <b>if a relative or</b> other <b>disqualified</b> witness <b>signed at the beginning,</b> before two valid witnesses had signed, then <b>some say</b> the bill of divorce is <b>valid and some say</b> that it is <b>invalid.

            "It is told: There was <b>a certain person who said to ten</b> men: <b>Write a bill of divorce for my wife.

            "The Gemara challenges: <b>But didn’t Reish Lakish say: Rabbi Shimon deemed</b> such a bill of divorce <b>valid only</b> if it was signed <b>immediately, but</b> after a delay <b>from now until ten days, no.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>With regard to that</b> question, whether the others must sign immediately, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who holds that they may sign after a delay.",
            "The Gemara challenges: <b>But didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say: Two</b> of them function <b>as witnesses, and all</b> the rest <b>of them</b> sign the bill of divorce only <b>due to</b> the <b>stipulation?</b> It is clear that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi does not hold in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi is concerned about the other witnesses and deems the bill of divorce valid only due to exigent circumstances. The Gemara answers: <b>With regard to this,</b> i.e., why the additional people must sign, <b>he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish</b> that all of them function as witnesses.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may write</b> a bill of divorce <b>with any</b> material that can be used for writing: <b>With <i>deyo</i>, with paint [<i>sam</i>], with <i>sikra</i>, with <i>komos</i>, with <i>kankantom</i> or with anything that</b> produces <b>permanent</b> writing.

            "§ <b>It was stated</b> that there was a related discussion about different types of writing: In the case of <b>one who passes ink over</b> letters written in <b>red dye on Shabbat, Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish both say</b> that he is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> sin-offerings for this: <b>One due to</b> violating the prohibition against <b>writing</b> on Shabbat, because he is now writing letters in ink, <b>and one due to</b> violating the prohibition against <b>erasing</b> on Shabbat, because as he writes he erases what is written in red dye.

However, if he wrote with <b>red dye on top of ink,</b> then <b>some say</b> that he is <b>liable and some say</b> that he is <b>exempt.</b>",
            "The Gemara explains these opinions: <b>Some say</b> that he is <b>liable</b> because <b>it is erasing,</b> as he erases the higher-quality, original writing. <b>Some say</b> that he is <b>exempt</b> because <b>he is destroying</b> and one who acts destructively is exempt, as he has not performed planned, constructive labor on Shabbat.",

Therefore, if the parchment was processed using gallnuts, the writing of the names of the witnesses, done with gall water, will not be permanent, and the witnesses may sign their names on top of that writing.

Rava’s proof is that it must be that ownership of the promissory note was transferred to the guarantor before he signed it, in order for his commitment to take effect. It may therefore be seen from this <i>baraita</i> that the participants understand the need to transfer ownership of the document.",
            "<b>Rav Ashi said: What is the difficulty</b> raised by this <i>baraita</i>? <b>Perhaps a man is different,</b> in <b>that</b> he <b>understands</b> the need <b>to transfer</b> the document, and the question of the Gemara pertains to a woman, who may not be as well versed in the minutiae of monetary law. <b>Rather, Rav Ashi said:</b> There is a proof <b>from</b> what was taught <b>here</b> (22b): <b>A woman may write her bill of divorce</b> on her own or allow a scribe to write it on her behalf, and then give it to her husband, so that he will give it to her. Similarly, <b>a man may write his receipt</b> that he will receive from the woman after paying her marriage contract, <b>as the ratification of a bill of divorce is only through its signatories,</b> i.e., the witnesses who sign it, and the mere writing of the document or its receipt has no legal ramifications and may be done by anyone. In any case, it is clear from here that a woman understands the need to transfer the bill of divorce that will be given to her by her husband in the future.",
            "§ <b>Rava says:</b> If <b>he wrote her a bill of divorce and placed it in the hand of his slave, and he wrote her a deed of gift with regard to</b> the slave, then <b>she acquired</b> the slave due to the document, <b>and she is divorced</b> immediately <b>by the</b> bill of divorce that is in his hand. The slave is considered to be like her property, and it is as though the husband had placed the bill of divorce in her domain at the time that he transferred the slave to her, and she acquires the bill of divorce as though it were in her courtyard.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And why</b> does she acquire the bill of divorce? The slave <b>is</b> considered <b>a mobile courtyard, and a mobile courtyard does not acquire</b> property. One’s courtyard can acquire items for him only when the courtyard is fixed in its location. Since a slave is considered to be like land with regard to other areas of <i>halakha</i>, he should also be defined as a mobile courtyard, as he can move from place to place. <b>And if you would say</b> that Rava was referring <b>to a</b> slave who happens to be <b>standing,</b> who is not mobile, <b>but didn’t Rava say: Anything that does not acquire when moving</b> also <b>does not acquire</b> when it is <b>standing or sitting.</b> The fact that the slave could move gives him the status of a moving courtyard, regardless if he is currently moving or not. The Gemara answers: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> taught by Rava could apply <b>in</b> a case where the slave was <b>bound</b> and unable to move, as in that case he is not even able to move, and is not considered to be a mobile courtyard.",
            "<b>And Rava</b> also <b>says:</b> If <b>he wrote her a bill of divorce and placed it in his courtyard, and he wrote a deed of gift with regard to</b> the courtyard, then <b>she has acquired</b> the courtyard <b>and is divorced</b> immediately <b>by the</b> bill of divorce in the courtyard.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for Rava to teach his <i>halakha</i> both with regard to a slave and with regard to a courtyard. One could not have been learned from the other, <b>as had he taught us</b> only about <b>a slave, I would say</b> that the husband may transfer the bill of divorce to his wife <b>specifically</b> through <b>a slave, but</b> in the case of <b>a courtyard</b> the Sages may decide <b>to enact a decree</b> that this should not be a valid bill of divorce, <b>due to</b> the case of <b>her courtyard that comes afterward.</b> People may not differentiate between this case and a similar case, where the husband places the bill of divorce in the courtyard of a third party, and that courtyard is subsequently acquired by her. In that case, the couple is not divorced, as the bill of divorce was not given by the husband to the wife. Therefore, Rava has to teach that the Sages did not make this decree, and in this case, where the husband gave the courtyard together with the bill of divorce, it is valid.",
            "<b>And had</b> Rava <b>taught us</b> only about <b>a courtyard,</b> then <b>I would say</b> that a woman is divorced <b>specifically</b> if her husband placed the bill of divorce in <b>a courtyard, but</b> in the case of <b>a slave</b> the Sages may decide <b>to decree</b> with regard to <b>a bound</b> slave that the divorce will not take effect, <b>due to</b> the similarity to <b>an unbound</b> slave, where the divorce would not take effect, as explained above. Therefore, Rava <b>teaches us</b> that it is a valid bill of divorce in both cases.",
            "<b>Abaye said</b> as a challenge to Rava: <b>Now, from where was a courtyard included?</b> What is the source for the <i>halakha</i> that a man can divorce a woman by placing a bill of divorce in her courtyard? This can be derived <b>from</b> the phrase: “And gives it in <b>her hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), and the Sages derived that this is not limited to her actual hand but also includes anything that is an extension of her hand, such as her courtyard.",
            "Consequently, the following reasoning should apply: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>her hand, that it</b> acquires property for her <b>whether with her consent or against her will, so too,</b> with regard to <b>her courtyard,</b> it should be <b>that it</b> acquires property for her <b>whether with her consent or against her will. And</b> with regard to <b>a gift, it is</b> so that she acquires it <b>with her consent,</b> but <b>it is not</b> so that she acquires it <b>against her will.</b> Therefore, a courtyard that a husband transfers to his wife as a gift along with a bill of divorce is not the same as a bill of divorce that he gives into her hand. As a courtyard is different from her hand in this sense, it should not be able to be used as a means of transferring a bill of divorce.",
            "<b>Rav Shimi bar Ashi objects to</b> the reasoning of Abaye: <b>But</b> what of <b>agency for receipt</b> of the bill of divorce, where the woman appoints an agent to receive a bill of divorce on her behalf, concerning <b>which</b> the agent can act <b>with her consent,</b> but <b>not against her will.</b> No one other than the wife can appoint an agent to receive the bill of divorce, and despite this <b>he is an agent for receipt.</b> Yet a woman is able to appoint an agent for receipt. Evidently, the comparison of other methods of acquisition to acquisition by placing the bill of divorce in her hand is not absolute.",
            "<b>And Abaye</b> would respond: <b>Is that to say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> of <b>agency is included from</b> the words <b>“her hand”?</b> It is not learned from there; rather, it <b>is included</b> based on the additional wording of the verse, as the verse does not state: <b>And he sent [<i>veshillaḥ</i>].</b> Rather, it states: <b>“And sends her out [<i>veshilleḥa</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1). The expanded term teaches that a woman can also appoint an agent to receive a bill of divorce on her behalf. Since agency has a different source in the Torah, it is not impacted by the limitations of her hand. The <i>halakha</i> that a bill of divorce can be given to her by placing it in her courtyard is an extension of the <i>halakha</i> that it can be placed in her hand and does carry the limitations of her hand. Therefore, it must be able to work whether with her consent or against her will.",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> a different answer: <b>We also have found</b> that <b>agency for receipt</b> can be effective <b>against her will.</b> How so? <b>As</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>a father can receive a bill of divorce for his minor daughter against her will.</b> The <i>halakhot</i> of agency are therefore consistent with the <i>halakhot</i> with regard to her hand, and Abaye’s objection stands.",
            "§ The mishna taught that a bill of divorce may be written <b>on an olive leaf,</b> on the horn of a cow, or on the hand of a slave, provided that the husband then gives her the slave or the cow. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> with regard to <b>the hand of a slave,</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>it is not possible to cut it off,</b> as it is certainly prohibited to cut off the hand of a slave, and he therefore must give her the slave. <b>But</b> if he wrote the bill of divorce on <b>the horn of a cow, let him cut it off and give it to her.</b> Why does the mishna state that he must give her the cow?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states: “And he writes</b> her a scroll of severance, <b>and gives it</b> in <b>her</b> hand” (Deuteronomy 24:1), meaning that <b>something</b> is valid as a bill of divorce <b>when it is lacking only writing and giving, excluding this,</b> a cow’s horn, <b>which is lacking writing, cutting, and giving.</b> Since the additional step of cutting would be required in order for him to give her the horn alone, the horn would not be a valid bill of divorce, so he must give her the cow.",
            "§ The mishna taught that <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says</b> that a bill of divorce may not be written on something living, nor on food. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason for Rabbi Yosei HaGelili’s</b> opinion? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is said in the Torah with regard to a bill of divorce: “And he writes her <b>a scroll</b> of severance” (Deuteronomy 24:1). From the word “scroll,” <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>a scroll</b> is valid; <b>from where</b> do I derive that it is correct <b>to include all objects</b> as valid materials upon which a bill of divorce may be written? <b>The verse states: “And he writes her,” in any case,</b> i.e., a bill of divorce can be written on any type of surface. <b>If so, what is</b> the meaning when <b>the verse states “scroll”?</b> This teaches: <b>Just as a scroll is neither alive nor food, so too,</b> a bill of divorce may be written on <b>any object that is neither alive nor food.</b> This is why Rabbi Yosei HaGelili deems invalid a bill of divorce written on a living being.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree and say that a bill of divorce may be written even on a living creature or on food, interpret the verse? They contend: <b>If</b> the verse <b>were written:</b> And he shall write for her <b>in the scroll [<i>besefer</i>],</b> then it would be <b>as you said,</b> and it would indicate the type of surface on which the bill of divorce may be written. <b>Now that it is written: “Scroll [<i>sefer</i>],” it comes to</b> teach that a mere <b>account of the matters [<i>sefirat devarim</i>]</b> is required. In other words, <i>sefer</i> is referring not to the surface on which a bill of divorce must be written, but rather, to the essence of the bill of divorce. The verse teaches that the bill of divorce must contain particular content.",
            "The Gemara continues: <b>And the Rabbis, what do they do with this</b> phrase in the verse: <b>“And he writes</b> her”? The Gemara answers: <b>For them,</b> that phrase <b>is required</b> to teach the principle that a woman <b>is divorced</b> only <b>via writing,</b> i.e., a bill of divorce, <b>and she is not divorced via</b> giving <b>money.</b> It might <b>enter your mind to say: I should juxtapose leaving</b> marriage, i.e., divorce, <b>to becoming</b> married, i.e., betrothal, and I will say that <b>just as becoming</b> married <b>is</b> effected <b>with</b> giving <b>money, so too, leaving</b> marriage can <b>also</b> be effected <b>with</b> giving <b>money.</b> Therefore, the Torah <b>teaches us:</b> “And he writes her”; divorce can be effected only with a written bill of divorce.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, from where does he derive this reasoning? <b>He derives it from</b> the phrase <b>“scroll of severance,”</b> which teaches that <b>a scroll,</b> i.e., a written document, <b>severs her</b> from her husband <b>and nothing else severs her</b> from him.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> those who hold <b>the other</b> opinion, the Rabbis, how do they explain this phrase? <b>For them,</b> the phrase “scroll of severance” <b>is required</b> to teach that a bill of divorce must be <b>a matter that severs</b> all connection <b>between him and her, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a man says to his wife: <b>This is your bill of divorce, on the condition that you will not</b> ever <b>drink wine,</b> or <b>on condition that you will never go to your father’s house, that is not severance,</b> and the bill of divorce is not valid. If a bill of divorce imposes a condition upon the woman that permanently binds her to her husband, her relationship with her husband has not been completely severed, which is a prerequisite for divorce. If, however, he imposes a condition <b>until thirty days</b> have passed, or for any other limited period of time, <b>that is severance.</b> The bill of divorce is valid, as the relationship will be completely terminated at the end of the thirty-day period.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, from where does he derive that a stipulation without a termination point invalidates the divorce? <b>From</b> the fact that instead of using the term <b><i>karet</i>,</b> the verse uses the more expanded term <b><i>keritut</i>.</b> Inasmuch as both terms denote severance, using the longer term teaches us two things: Divorce can be effected only via writing and not through money, and divorce requires total severance.",
            "<b>And the other,</b> the Rabbis, what do they derive from this? The Gemara answers: <b>They do not derive</b> anything from the expansion of <b><i>karet</i></b> to <b><i>keritut</i>.</b>",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may not write</b> a bill of divorce <b>on</b> anything that is <b>attached to the ground.</b> If <b>one wrote it on</b> something that was <b>attached</b> to the ground, and afterward he <b>detached it, signed it, and gave it to her,</b> then it is <b>valid. Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> a bill of divorce <b>invalid unless its writing and its signing</b> were performed when it was already <b>detached.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says: One may not write</b> a bill of divorce <b>on erased paper or on unfinished leather</b> [<b><i>diftera</i></b>], <b>because</b> writing on these surfaces <b>can be forged. And the Rabbis deem valid</b> a bill of divorce that was written on either of these items.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna taught: If <b>one wrote it on</b> something that was <b>attached</b> to the ground, and detached it before he gave it to her, then it is valid. The Gemara challenges: <b>But didn’t you say</b> in <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna that <b>one may not write</b> a bill of divorce on something that is attached to the ground? <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The mishna’s statement that if something was detached and signed then it is a valid bill of divorce <b>is</b> applicable only <b>when one left a place for the essential</b> part of the document. He did not write the entire bill of divorce while it was attached to the ground. Rather, he wrote only the standard part of the bill of divorce. However, he left a place for the essential part of the bill of divorce, which includes the names of the man and woman, and wrote that part only after it was detached.",
            "<b>And so Rabbi Elazar says</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya says: And this is</b> a case <b>where he left a place for the essential</b> part of the document. <b>And so Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: And this is when he left a place for the essential</b> part of the document. <b>And</b> all these Sages hold that the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, who says: Witnesses of the transmission</b> of the bill of divorce <b>effect</b> the divorce. It is not the signatures of the witnesses on a bill of divorce that validate it. Rather, the divorce is effected by the transmission of the document in the presence of witnesses. Therefore, the phrase: “And he writes” (Deuteronomy 24:1), must be referring to the writing of the bill of divorce and not to the signing of the witnesses, and the restrictions derived from this verse will apply to the writing of the bill of divorce, so the essential part may not be written on something that is attached to the ground.",
            "<b>And this is what</b> the mishna <b>is saying: One may not write</b> even the <b>standard</b> part on something that is attached to the ground <i>ab initio</i>, <b>lest he write</b> the <b>essential</b> part of the document in this manner as well. However, if <b>he wrote the standard</b> part while it was attached to the ground, <b>and then detached it, wrote the essential</b> part, <b>and gave it to her,</b> it is <b>valid.</b>",
            "<b>And Reish Lakish says:</b> The mishna should not be understood in that way, where the phrase: And signed it, is referring to the writing of the essential part, since <b>we learned</b> that <b>they signed it,</b> which is referring to the signatures of the witnesses.

Therefore, by Torah law, the limitation that it not be attached while he writes applies only to the signing but not to the writing. The Sages decreed that the essential part of the bill of divorce also not be written while it is attached to the ground, but if he violated this decree, it is still valid after the fact.",
            "§ In connection with this discussion, the Gemara mentions several <i>halakhot</i> that are affected by items being attached to the ground or detached.

In that case, all agree that a bill of divorce that is fully written while attached is invalid.",
            "§ The Gemara has another discussion with regard to a perforated pot: In the case of <b>a pot</b> that <b>belongs to one</b> person <b>and the plants</b> in it <b>belong to another</b> person, if the <b>owner of</b> the <b>pot sold</b> it <b>to</b> the <b>owner of</b> the <b>plants,</b> then <b>once</b> the owner of the plants <b>pulled</b> the pot, <b>he has acquired</b> the pot, as it is a movable object, which can be acquired via pulling.

Since the plants are considered to be attached to the ground, as they are in a perforated pot, they are considered to be part of the ground, which cannot be acquired by pulling.",
            "If <b>the pot and plants belong to one</b> person, <b>and he sold them to another</b> person, then once the buyer <b>took possession of the plants</b> and acquired them, <b>he acquired the pot</b> as well. <b>And this is</b> an example of the principle <b>that we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kiddushin</i> 26a): <b>Property that does not serve as a guarantee,</b> i.e., movable property, <b>can be acquired with property that serves as a guarantee,</b> i.e., land, <b>through</b> the giving of <b>money, or with a document, or by taking possession.</b> Therefore, once one takes possession of the plants, which are considered to be like land, he also acquires the pot, which is a movable object.",
            "However, if the buyer <b>took possession of</b> just <b>the pot,</b> then <b>he does not even acquire the pot,</b> as movable property cannot be acquired through taking possession, <b>until he takes possession of the plants.</b> To acquire the pot, one must either perform an act of acquisition specific to movable items, such as pulling, or acquire the plants through taking possession of them, resulting in the acquisition of the pot, as stated earlier.",
            "The Gemara discusses another issue with regard to perforated pots: If a perforated pot was on the border of Eretz Yisrael, and <b>its perforation was in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>but its branches</b> were <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, then what is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to mitzvot that apply to produce grown in Eretz Yisrael, such as <i>terumot</i> and tithes? <b>Abaye said: We follow its perforation,</b> and it is considered to be growing in Eretz Yisrael. <b>Rava said: We follow its branches,</b> and it is considered to be growing outside of Eretz Yisrael.",
            "The Gemara notes: <b>In</b> a case <b>where</b> the plant in the pot <b>took root</b> in the ground, <b>everyone agrees</b> that it has the status of a plant that grows in the place where its roots are. <b>When they disagree,</b> it is <b>with regard to</b> a case <b>where it did not take root.</b> Since its roots are contained within the pot, there is a disagreement whether we follow the perforation or the branches in determining its status.",
            "The Gemara challenges: <b>And do they not disagree with regard to</b> a case <b>where it took root?</b> Do all agree that its status is determined by where the roots are? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 118b): In a case of <b>two gardens</b> that belong to two different people that are on adjacent terraces <b>one above the other, and leafy vegetables</b> are growing <b>between them</b> on the wall of the step between the two gardens, <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> These leafy vegetables <b>belong to</b> the owner of the <b>upper</b> garden, and <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> These leafy vegetables <b>belong</b> to the owner of the <b>lower</b> garden. In this case, the roots emerge from the upper garden, but the vegetables grow into the airspace of the lower garden. This seems to be analogous to the case where the roots are in Eretz Yisrael and the branches are outside of Eretz Yisrael, or vice versa, and there is a dispute as to who is the owner of the vegetables.",
            "The Gemara makes a distinction between the two cases: <b>There,</b> in the case cited in the mishna in <i>Bava Metzia</i>, <b>the reason</b> for that <i>halakha</i> is <b>as is taught</b> in the mishna, that <b>Rabbi Meir said: What if</b> the owner of the <b>upper</b> garden <b>would wish to take his earth?</b> This would result in a situation where <b>there are no</b> more <b>vegetables,</b> as the vegetables would not have earth from which to draw nutrients. The fact that the owner of the upper garden has the ability to destroy the vegetables is an indication that he is the owner.",

The fact that the owner of the lower garden has the ability to destroy the vegetables is an indication that he is the owner. Their dispute is not with regard to how to define where the vegetables are growing; rather, they disagree with regard to who has control over the continued existence of these plants. Therefore, this dispute is not related to the issue of the plant that is growing on the border.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But still, do they not disagree with regard to</b> a case <b>where</b> the plant <b>took root?

The Gemara answers: Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel’s statement is referring to a case where <b>a rock divides</b> the roots up to the trunk, and therefore it is possible to distinguish between the parts of the tree that draw nutrients from Eretz Yisrael and the parts that draw nutrients from outside of Eretz Yisrael.",
            "The Gemara asks: If it is so that the roots are clearly distinguishable, <b>what is the reasoning of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? Why does he view the fruits as being a mixture?

With regard to a bill of divorce, it is so <b>that the writing proves</b> that the husband is divorcing his wife. The mishna does not teach <b>that the writing and statement prove</b> this. Consequently, the statement of: It was written in my presence, is not needed. This indicates that the mishna is discussing a case that takes place in Eretz Yisrael.",
            "§ The mishna teaches that <b>the woman herself may bring</b> her own bill of divorce and state that it was written and signed in her presence. The Gemara asks: Why does she need to bring it and testify that it was written and signed in her presence? With regard to this <b>woman, once her bill of divorce reaches her hand, she is divorced. Rav Huna says:</b> This mishna is referring <b>to one who says</b> to his wife: <b>You will be divorced through it only in the presence of such and such court,</b> and the divorce does not take effect when she receives the bill of divorce. The Gemara asks: <b>Ultimately, once she arrives there,</b> to that court, <b>she is</b> immediately <b>divorced through it,</b> as she has fulfilled the condition set forth by her husband. Why, then, is it necessary for her to bring the bill of divorce and to testify?",
            "<b>Rather, Rav Huna bar Manoaḥ said in the name of Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika:</b> This mishna is referring to a case <b>where he said to her: When you arrive there, place</b> the bill of divorce <b>on the ground and take it.</b> Consequently, the divorce does not take effect immediately upon her arrival.",
            "The Gemara challenges: <b>If that is so, isn’t it</b> like the case where he said to his wife: <b>Take your bill of divorce from off the ground, and Rava says:</b> If a husband says to his wife: <b>Take your bill of divorce from off the ground,</b> then it is as though <b>he said nothing.</b> He is not considered to have given her a bill of divorce; rather, she has taken it on her own.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the mishna should be explained as follows: This is referring to a case <b>where he said to</b> his wife: <b>Be</b> my <b>agent for delivery</b> of the bill of divorce <b>until you arrive there. And when you arrive there, be</b> your own <b>agent for receipt, and receive your bill of divorce</b> as an agent.",
            "The Gemara challenges: <b>But the agency has not returned to the husband.</b> In other words, the first agency, where she acted as the agent for delivery, has not ended, because an agent must have the ability to complete his involvement in the act, return to the person who appointed him, and inform him that the agency has been carried out. In this case, once she arrives at the court, her agency ends when she assumes the role of the recipient of the bill of divorce, and her involvement does not end. Therefore, the appointment of the agent itself is deficient, and the divorce should not take effect. Rather, the mishna should be explained that he <b>said to her: Be an agent for delivery until you arrive there, and when you arrive there, appoint an agent for receipt</b> on your behalf and give him the bill of divorce.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who said: A woman can appoint an agent to receive her bill of divorce from the hand of the agent of her husband,</b> and it is not required that she receive the bill of divorce herself. <b>However, according to the one who says: A woman cannot appoint an agent to receive her bill of divorce from the hand of the agent of her husband, what can be said?</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>What is the reason</b> of the one who said that the woman cannot appoint an agent to receive her bill of divorce from the agent of her husband? <b>Because there is degradation of the husband</b> in doing this, as he wishes to give the bill of divorce directly to the woman and not to an agent. <b>And here the husband is not particular</b> about the matter, as he instructed her to do so.",
            "The Gemara clarifies: <b>This works out well according to the one who said:</b> The reason for this <i>halakha</i> is <b>due to</b> the concern about the <b>degradation of the husband. But according to the one who says</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is a decree <b>due to</b> the case of <b>her courtyard that comes afterward, what can be said?</b> Some say that the reason for the <i>halakha</i> that the woman cannot appoint an agent to receive the bill of divorce from the agent of her husband is that there was a concern that if she were able to do so, then the courts may eventually allow her to be divorced by purchasing a courtyard into which her husband had placed the bill of divorce. In the latter case, the divorce does not take effect. The courtyard needs to be an extension of the hand of the woman, into which the husband places the bill of divorce, but it does not act as her agent. In any event, according to this opinion, the fact that the husband is not particular does not prevent this <i>halakha</i> from applying, as it does not depend on him.",
            "The Gemara answers: According to this opinion, the mishna should be explained as discussing a case <b>when he said to her: Be an agent for delivery</b> of this bill of divorce <b>until you arrive there, and when you arrive there, appoint</b> another <b>agent for delivery, and receive your bill of divorce from him.</b>",

The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> novel element warrants the use of the term: <b>Moreover?</b> The Gemara answers by quoting a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> that <b>not</b> only <b>this</b> bill of divorce, which was written for practice and <b>which was not written for the sake of divorce,</b> is unfit, <b>but even that</b> bill of divorce, <b>which was written for the sake of divorce</b> but the husband then reconsidered and did not use it, is <b>unfit</b> to be used by someone else.",

            "The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> that a bill of divorce must be written for the sake of the woman who is being divorced? It is stated in the verse that deals with divorce: “And he writes for her a scroll of severance and gives it in her hand” (Deuteronomy 24:1). This teaches the following: <b>If</b> the Merciful One had <b>written</b> only: <b>And he gives a scroll of severance in her hand, I would say</b> that the verse serves <b>to exclude this</b> case of the <b>first</b> clause of the mishna, <b>where it was done not for the sake of severance,</b> as the scribe wrote the bill of divorce as a mere exercise; <b>however,</b> if one <b>wrote</b> a bill of divorce <b>to divorce his wife but</b> then <b>reconsidered, where</b> it was <b>done for the sake of severance,</b> I would <b>say</b> that it is <b>valid</b> for another man to use for divorcing his wife. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes</b> in the Torah: <b>“And he writes,”</b> meaning that the bill of divorce must be written exclusively for the sake of his own divorce.",
            "The Gemara continues the explanation: <b>If the Merciful One</b> had <b>written</b> only: <b>And he writes, I would say</b> that the verse serves <b>to exclude this</b> case mentioned previously, <b>where</b> the man using the bill of divorce <b>was not the one who wrote it; but</b> if a man <b>has two wives</b> with the same name, so <b>that</b> the man using the bill of divorce <b>is writing it, say</b> that it is a <b>valid</b> bill of divorce. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes</b> in the Torah: “And he writes <b>for her,”</b> teaching that a bill of divorce must be written <b>for the sake of</b> a specific wife.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And why do I</b> need <b>the last clause</b> of the mishna, which deals with a man who writes a bill of divorce for whichever wife he later chooses? The earlier clauses made clear that one must write the bill of divorce for the sake of the woman who is being divorced. The Gemara answers: <b>This teaches us that there is no</b> retroactive <b>clarification,</b> i.e., that one does not say that since he gave the bill of divorce to this wife, it is clarified retroactively that he had written the bill of divorce for her sake; rather, he must write it for her sake from the outset.",
            "§ The mishna teaches: If he <b>wrote</b> a bill of divorce <b>to divorce the older</b> of his two wives and then reconsidered, he <b>may not divorce the younger</b> wife <b>with it,</b> even though the two wives share the same name. The Gemara deduces from this: <b>It is the younger</b> one <b>whom he is not able to divorce with it, but he is able to divorce the older</b> wife <b>with it,</b> as it was written for her from the outset. This is the case even though the younger wife would be able to collect payment of her marriage contract and remarry if she were to present this bill of divorce, as the court would think it was written for her.",

Here too, there is a concern lest the wife of the other use the bill of divorce to collect payment of her marriage contract even though the bill of divorce was not written for her.",
            "<b>Rather, what have you to say</b> to explain how the first man can divorce his wife with this bill of divorce, and how it can be used as a reliable proof of divorce?

            "<b>And Shmuel follows his</b> own line of <b>reasoning, as Shmuel says: Any place where the Sages taught</b> in a mishna: <b>An invalid bill of divorce,</b> it indicates both that it is <b>invalid</b> to be used as a bill of divorce <b>and</b> that it nevertheless <b>disqualifies</b> the one who receives it from marrying a priest.

            "The Gemara quotes another opinion with regard to the question of which of the bills of divorce mentioned in the mishna would disqualify the woman from marrying a priest. <b>Ze’eiri says:</b> Reception of <b>any</b> of the bills of divorce mentioned in the mishna <b>does not disqualify</b> the woman from marrying a priest <b>except</b> in <b>the final</b> case, where the husband instructed the scribe to write a bill of divorce for one of his wives and explained that he would later decide which wife would be given the bill of divorce.",

According to Rabbi Yoḥanan, there is no concern that retroactive clarification will determine that the bill of divorce was written for the sake of the woman who received it, while the <i>amora’im</i> who hold that the woman is disqualified from marrying a priest in the final case of the mishna regard the efficacy of retroactive clarification to be uncertain.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan follows his</b> own line of <b>reasoning. As Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Brothers who divided</b> property they received as an inheritance <b>are</b> considered <b>purchasers</b> from each other, <b>and</b> as purchasers of land <b>they must return</b> the portions <b>to each other in the Jubilee</b> Year. In the Jubilee Year, all land that had been purchased since the previous Jubilee Year reverts to the possession of the original owner. In this case, the land the brothers inherited from their father reverts to their joint ownership. Evidently, when they divided the land, this is not viewed as if it is retroactively clarified who inherited which portion from their father.",
            "<b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for Rabbi Yoḥanan to state that there is no retroactive clarification both with regard to inheritance and with regard to a bill of divorce, <b>as, if it were stated</b> only <b>with regard to this</b> case, that of a bill of divorce, then one could say that <b>with regard to this Rabbi Yoḥanan said that there is no</b> retroactive <b>clarification because we require</b> that the bill of divorce be written in accordance with the verse: “He writes <b>for her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:3), i.e., <b>for her sake; but there,</b> in the case of inheritance, one could say: <b>It is</b> only in the case of <b>a sale that the Merciful One states that it will be returned in the Jubilee</b> Year, <b>but an inheritance and a gift</b> will <b>not</b> be returned.",
            "<b>And if he</b> had <b>taught us</b> that there is no retroactive clarification only with regard to the inheritance of <b>a field,</b> then one could say that this is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> he holds that they must redistribute the property only <b>as a stringency,</b> but he would hold that in this case one must also be stringent and be concerned that it is a divorce. <b>Alternatively,</b> perhaps Rabbi Yoḥanan’s ruling was not because there is no retroactive clarification but because the <i>halakha</i> of the Jubilee Year requires that all land be returned to its state <b>as</b> it was <b>initially,</b> when the land had been divided among the tribes; <b>but here,</b> with regard to a bill of divorce, <b>say</b> that this consideration is <b>not</b> relevant, and there is retroactive clarification. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> for Rabbi Yoḥanan to rule that there is no retroactive clarification in each case separately.",
            "§ The Gemara continues its discussion of the final case of the mishna. <b>Rav Hoshaya asked of Rav Yehuda:</b> If a husband <b>said to a scribe: Write</b> a bill of divorce <b>for whichever</b> of my wives <b>emerges</b> from <b>the entrance first, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?

            "Questioning Rav Yehuda’s original answer to Rav Hoshaya, <b>Abaye said:</b> He <b>asks him</b> about a case where one <b>makes</b> the clarification <b>dependent on the decision of others, but he resolves it</b> based on a case where the husband <b>makes</b> the clarification <b>dependent on his own decision.</b> Rav Hoshaya asked about a bill of divorce written for whichever wife exits first, which depends on someone other than the husband, and Rav Yehuda resolved the question based on the mishna where the husband reserved the right to decide which wife he will divorce with the bill of divorce, which depends on his own decision. <b>And then</b> Rav Hoshaya <b>raised an objection to him</b> based on the mishna concerning the Paschal offering, where <b>one makes</b> the clarification <b>dependent on the decision of others.</b>",

            "The Gemara elaborates: When one <b>makes it dependent on his own decision,</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>does not accept</b> the principle of retroactive <b>clarification, as it is taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Demai</i> 8:7): In the case of <b>one who purchases wine from among the Samaritans,</b> about whom it is assumed that they did not separate <i>teruma</i> and tithes, and he is not in a position to now separate <i>teruma</i>, he acts as follows: If there are, for example, one hundred <i>log</i> of wine in the barrels, he <b>says: Two <i>log</i> that I will separate in the future are <i>teruma</i>,</b> as the mandated average measure of <i>teruma</i> is one-fiftieth; <b>ten</b> <i>log</i> are <b>first tithe;</b> and one-tenth of the remainder, which is approximately <b>nine</b> <i>log</i>, are <b>second tithe.</b>"

This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> However, <b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon prohibit</b> this practice, as they hold that in this case there is no retroactive clarification.

            "By contrast, in a case where one <b>makes</b> the outcome <b>dependent on the decision of others,</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>accepts</b> the principle of retroactive <b>clarification, as we learned</b> in a mishna (73a): In a case where an ill husband says to his wife: This is your bill of divorce from now if I die due to this illness, if he dies, the bill of divorce takes effect from the time of his statement. The mishna asks: <b>What</b> is the halakhic status of the wife <b>in those days</b> between when the bill of divorce was given but before the husband died?",
            "<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: She is like a married woman with regard to all of her matters,</b> and she remains forbidden to other men; <b>and when he will die, it is a bill of divorce.</b> Death is equivalent to a matter that is dependent on the decision of others. Since Rabbi Yehuda agrees that the bill of divorce takes effect retroactively, as it cannot take effect after the death of the husband, he evidently holds that there is retroactive clarification where one makes the clarification dependent on the decision of others.",

            "The Gemara offers an alternative resolution to the contradiction between the mishna here, on the one hand, and the mishna in tractate <i>Bava Metzia</i> and the <i>baraita</i>, on the other hand. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said:</b> It is possible to resolve the contradiction in a different way: The latter permit one to return a lost bill of divorce only in a case <b>where</b> the <b>witnesses</b> who signed the bill of divorce <b>say: We have never signed a bill of divorce of Yosef ben Shimon other than</b> this <b>one,</b> in which case there is no concern that the bill of divorce belongs to someone else.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so, what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> that one returns the bill of divorce? Since it clearly belongs to her, there is no question that it must be returned to her. The Gemara answers: It is necessary <b>lest you say</b> that <b>one should be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps it happened</b> that another bill of divorce was written in which <b>the names</b> of the husband and the wife <b>are identical to the names</b> of the husband and wife of the second bill of divorce, <b>and</b> the names of the <b>witnesses</b> on that bill of divorce <b>are identical to</b> the names of the <b>witnesses</b> on this bill of divorce, when in fact they are different witnesses. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that this is not a concern.",
            "The Gemara suggests an alternative resolution to the contradiction. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> When do the mishna in tractate <i>Bava Metzia</i> and the <i>baraita</i> rule that one should return the bill of divorce? It is in a case <b>where</b> the one who lost it <b>says: There is a hole in</b> the bill of divorce, <b>next to such and such a letter, as this is a clear-cut distinguishing mark for him.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> Rav Ashi permits the returning of such a bill of divorce <b>specifically</b> when one says that the hole is <b>next to such and such a letter, as that is a clear-cut distinguishing mark for him. But</b> if he said <b>only</b> that it had <b>a hole</b> without mentioning its precise location, then one should <b>not</b> return the bill of divorce, as that is not considered a clear-cut distinguishing mark.",
            "The Gemara explains: Rav Ashi <b>is uncertain</b> with regard to <b>whether</b> the obligation to return a lost item to its owner on the basis of <b>distinguishing marks</b> is <b>by Torah law</b> or <b>if</b> it is <b>by rabbinic law.</b> Therefore, in the case of a bill of divorce, he holds that one may rely only on a clear-cut distinguishing mark, as everyone agrees that the requirement to return a lost item to its owner on the basis of a clear-cut distinguishing mark is by Torah law.",
            "Apropos this discussion the Gemara relates an incident: <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana lost the bill of divorce</b> that he was transmitting, when he was <b>in the study hall.

            "§ The mishna teaches that if one found the bill of divorce immediately, it is valid, <b>but if not,</b> then it is <b>invalid. The Sages taught: What is</b> considered <b>not immediately? Rabbi Natan says:</b> It is <b>when</b> there was <b>a delay equivalent</b> to the amount of time it would take <b>for a caravan to pass</b> by <b>and camp</b> there. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> There is no fixed amount of time; rather, it is within the category of immediately <b>as</b> long as <b>there will be a person</b> that <b>stands and sees that no</b> other <b>person passed there.

            "The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of his appointment as an agent? <b>If</b> this is a case <b>where</b> the husband <b>said to</b> the agent: <b>Deliver</b> this bill of divorce to my wife, then <b>even though</b> the agent <b>did not become sick,</b> he may <b>also</b> appoint an agent in his place, as the husband did not state that he must be the one to deliver the bill of divorce. <b>And if</b> this is a case <b>where he said to</b> the agent: <b>You, deliver</b> this bill of divorce to my wife, then <b>even</b> if <b>he became sick, he also may not</b> appoint a second agent in his place, as the husband specified that he must be the one to deliver the bill of divorce. <b>And if</b> the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel,</b> then <b>even</b> if <b>he became sick</b> he <b>also may not</b> appoint a second agent, no matter what the husband said.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (2:13): If the husband said to an agent: <b>Deliver this bill of divorce to my wife,</b> then <b>this</b> agent <b>may send it in the possession of another</b> agent.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that the mishna is referring to a case where the husband said to his agent: <b>Deliver</b> the bill of divorce, without specifying that he must be the one to do so, and Rav Kahana understood the <i>baraita</i> as follows: <b>And this</b> <i>halakha</i>, that he may send it in the possession of another agent, applies only <b>when</b> the agent <b>became sick.

            "<b>Abaye said: There, what is the reason</b> that an agent may not be appointed?

However, <b>here,</b> after he has already sent the bill of divorce, the <b>husband is not particular</b> that word not spread, and therefore the agent may designate another agent in his place.",
            "<b>Rava said:</b> There is a different reason that in the case of the mishna (66a) the agent may not appoint another to write the bill of divorce; it is <b>because</b> of the fact <b>that</b> in the case there, the husband’s instructions <b>are</b> mere <b>words, and</b> verbal <b>directives cannot be delegated to an agent,</b> i.e., an agent cannot be deputized to give instructions on behalf of another. Therefore, they cannot take their oral instructions and transfer them to another. In the case of the mishna here, the agent is able to give the physical bill of divorce to another agent and thereby transfer his agency.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the difference <b>between</b> the explanations offered by Abaye and Rava? The Gemara answers: There is a practical difference <b>between them</b> in the case of <b>an agent</b> appointed to write a deed of <b>a gift, and</b> their disagreement is parallel <b>to the dispute of Rav and Shmuel. Rav says:</b> A deed of <b>gift is not like a bill of divorce,</b> as the gift giver does not care who writes the deed. Since it is not degrading to him if another agent writes the deed of gift instead of the agent that he appointed, the agent may appoint another agent. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> A deed of <b>gift is like a bill of divorce,</b> as the mere words instructing the agent to write the deed cannot be transferred to another agent.",
            "§ The mishna teaches: <b>But if</b> the husband <b>said to</b> the agent: When you transmit the bill of divorce to my wife, <b>take for me such and such an item from her,</b> then the agent may not appoint a second agent, as it is not the desire of the husband that his deposit be in the possession of another. <b>Reish Lakish says: Here, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>taught</b> that <b>a borrower is not allowed to lend</b> the item that he borrowed to someone else, <b>and a renter is not allowed to rent out</b> the item that he rented to someone else. In those cases, the same reasoning applies, i.e., that it is not the desire of the owner that his item be in the possession of another.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to him: Even schoolchildren know this</b> <i>halakha</i>, and this is not the novel idea expressed in the mishna. The novel idea expressed in the mishna is as follows: Not only is it not permitted for an agent to appoint another agent in this case, as it violates the desire of the husband, <b>but sometimes</b> it happens <b>that the bill of divorce is also not</b> valid if a second agent is appointed.

            "<b>And we discussed</b> this <i>halakha</i>: <b>And let there be a concern</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the husband <b>was mollified</b> and decided not to divorce his wife, and canceled the bill of divorce. <b>And Rabba bar Rav Huna said: This</b> is what <b>my father, my master,</b> Rav Huna, <b>said in the name of Rav:</b> The mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> the husband <b>says:</b> My wife <b>is deemed credible to say that I did not arrive.</b> Since the husband abrogated his right to contest the validity of the divorce by granting absolute credibility to his wife, there is no concern that he may have canceled the bill of divorce, as even if he were to claim that he had done so, his claim would not be accepted. By contrast, in this incident, where the wife was never granted such credibility, there is a concern that perhaps he canceled the bill of divorce.",
            "Rava <b>was embarrassed</b> that he ruled incorrectly. <b>Ultimately, the matter was revealed that</b> this woman <b>was</b> the husband’s <b>betrothed</b> and that they had not married. <b>Rava said: If they said</b> that there is a concern <b>with regard to a married woman</b> that perhaps he was mollified, <b>would they say</b> the same <b>with regard to a betrothed woman,</b> whom he does not know well?

            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna continues the discussion of the presumption that a person remains alive.

            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And if</b> the lender <b>seeks to renege</b> on this agreement, <b>he may not renege.</b> If <b>the owner despaired</b> of retrieving the loan, as he thought that he would not need to separate any <i>teruma</i> or tithes and therefore thought that he would not collect payment for the loan, although it later became clear that he was mistaken, <b>he may not separate</b> the <i>teruma</i> and tithes from his produce <b>on the basis of that</b> money, <b>because one may not separate</b> <i>teruma</i> and tithes <b>on the basis of</b> one’s loan that one had thought <b>lost.</b> Once he despaired of retrieving the loan, the sum of the loan is permanently acquired by the borrowers and the lender may not use the tithes and <i>teruma</i> to serve as repayment.",

            "The mishna states further: <b>If</b> he stated this <b>once the bill of divorce had entered her possession, he can no longer render it void,</b> as the divorce had already taken effect. The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t</b> this <b>obvious?</b> Once the bill of divorce has entered her possession, they are divorced. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for the mishna to state that even in a case <b>where he was going around searching for</b> the bill of divorce <b>from the beginning</b> in order <b>to render it void</b> before it reached his wife, once it enters her possession it is too late. <b>Lest you say:</b> Once he renders the bill of divorce void, even after it had entered her possession, <b>it has become clear retroactively that he rendered it void</b> from the beginning, before it reached his wife, therefore the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that since the bill of divorce was rendered void only after it had entered her possession, they are divorced.",

Does he mean to render the bill of divorce void from that point onward, which he has the ability to do, or is he merely noting the fact that this bill of divorce is void, in which case his statement does not affect the validity of the document?

            "The Gemara first clarifies the details of the incident: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>she was punished</b> if she in fact did not derive any benefit from the dinar? The Gemara answers: <b>Because she benefited</b> [<b><i>ishtarshi</i></b>] <b>from the place of the dinar,</b> as the dinar took up space in the bread, enabling her to use less flour. Therefore, she did derive some small benefit from the dinar.",
            "The Gemara asks: If she in fact did derive benefit from the dinar, then <b>what</b> is meant by the statement: <b>One who takes an oath truthfully?</b> Wasn’t her oath actually false? The Gemara answers: It means that she was <b>like one who took an oath truthfully,</b> as her oath was truthful to the best of her knowledge. In any case, this woman was punished severely for a small mistake. The severity of taking a false oath, even inadvertently, is why the Sages ceased administering oaths to widows.",
            "The Gemara questions if this could be the reason for the ordinance: <b>If</b> they refrained from administering oaths <b>due to this</b> reason, then <b>why</b> would this be limited <b>specifically</b> to <b>a widow?

            "The Gemara answers: <b>A widow is different,</b> as she continues to live in the house with the orphans and performs many services for them in the running of the home.

But Rav does not collect</b> payment of <b>a marriage contract for a widow</b> because she has not taken an oath, which indicates that he also would not administer an oath to her outside of the court.

What, is it not</b> the case that <b>she takes a vow now,</b> after she has remarried? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is possible to explain that it is referring to <b>when she took a vow initially,</b> before remarrying.",

The Gemara answers: <b>This is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as there is one who says: A vow that was taken in public has</b> the possibility of <b>nullification</b> by the husband, and therefore, even if the widow takes the vow in public, her husband can nullify it. As a result, she can collect payment of her marriage contract only if she takes a vow before she remarries. <b>And there is one who says:</b> A vow that was taken in public <b>does not have</b> the possibility of <b>nullification.</b> Therefore, even after the widow remarries, she is still able to take a vow and collect payment, as she takes the vow in public.",

            "The Gemara explains each one’s reasoning: <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>he does not need</b> to detail the vow, <b>as if you say</b> that <b>he needs</b> to do so, <b>sometimes</b> the person who took the vow <b>will cut short his statement</b> and not provide all of the details of the vow, <b>and the halakhic authority dissolves</b> only <b>what he hears</b> and does not dissolve the vow in its entirety. Nevertheless, the one who took the vow will act as though the vow has been dissolved entirely. Therefore, it is preferable that he just report that he took a vow, and the halakhic authority will dissolve it entirely, whatever it is.",
            "<b>Rav Pappa says</b> that <b>he needs</b> to detail the vow, <b>because</b> the vow might concern <b>a matter that</b> is <b>prohibited,</b> such as the case of the mishna here where it is essential that the vow not be dissolved, as the purpose of the vow is to ensure that the widow will not lie. In such a case, if the halakhic authority is not aware of the circumstances that prompted the widow to take the vow, he could mistakenly dissolve it.",
            "The Gemara attempts to bring a proof that one must detail the vow: <b>We learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bekhorot</i> 45b): A priest <b>who marries women in transgression</b> of a prohibition is <b>disqualified</b> from taking part in the Temple service <b>until he takes a vow</b> not to derive <b>benefit</b> from his wives, thereby requiring him to divorce them. <b>And it is taught with regard to this: He takes a vow and</b> immediately <b>serves</b> in the Temple. <b>He</b> then <b>descends</b> from the service <b>and divorces</b> his wives. <b>And if you say</b> that <b>he does not need to detail the vow,</b> then <b>let us be concerned lest he go to a halakhic authority and</b> the halakhic authority <b>dissolve</b> the vow <b>for him.</b> He would then remain married to the women who are prohibited to him, and serve in the Temple despite being disqualified from doing so."

            "§ The Gemara discusses another dispute with regard to one who emancipates half of his slave. <b>Rabba said:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and the Rabbis concerning whether the slave can be half-emancipated applies only <b>when</b> the master <b>freed half of him and left</b> the other <b>half of him</b> unaffected. <b>However,</b> if he <b>freed half of him and sold</b> the other <b>half of him, or gave</b> the other <b>half of him as a gift</b> to someone else, then, <b>since</b> the slave <b>left him entirely,</b> as the original master no longer owns any portion of the slave, <b>everyone agrees</b> that the slave has <b>acquired</b> half of his freedom.",
            "<b>Abaye said to him: And do they not disagree with regard to</b> a case where <b>he</b> is released <b>entirely?

Seemingly, the two <i>baraitot</i> contradict each other.",
            "Abaye continues his question: <b>What, is it not</b> that the way to reconcile the <i>baraitot</i> is to say that <b>this,</b> the first <i>baraita</i>, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, that emancipation can take effect with regard to half a slave? <b>And that,</b> the second <i>baraita</i>, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who maintain that even when the master retains no hold on the slave, a slave cannot be partially released?",
            "The Gemara offers a different reconciliation: <b>No,</b> both <b>this and that</b> <i>baraita</i> are in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. This</b> first <i>baraita</i> is discussing a case <b>where one said</b> that he is giving <b>all of</b> his property to each one of the slaves. Since he gave everything to both of them, they each acquire the property, including each other, emancipate each other, and divide the property between them. <b>That</b> second <i>baraita</i> is discussing a case <b>where one said</b> that he is giving <b>half</b> of his property to one slave and <b>half</b> of it to the other, so neither is fully emancipated.",
            "The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>But from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause</b> of the second <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches: But if he said</b> that he is giving <b>half</b> of his property to one slave and <b>half</b> of it to the other, <b>they did not acquire</b> the property, <b>it may be inferred that the first clause</b> is discussing a case <b>where he said</b> that he is giving <b>all of</b> his property to each one of them, and yet they do not acquire the property. The Gemara answers: There are not two separate cases in the <i>baraita</i>. Rather, the second clause <b>is explaining</b> the first clause of the <i>baraita</i>, as follows: <b>They did not acquire even themselves. How so? For example,</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where</b> the master <b>said</b> that he is giving <b>half</b> of his property to one slave and <b>half</b> of it to the other.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> to say this, <b>for if it enters your mind</b> to say that <b>the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> is discussing a case <b>where he said</b> that he gives <b>all of</b> his property to his slaves, and yet they do not acquire it, then the latter clause is unnecessary. <b>Now</b> that the mishna taught that if <b>one said</b> that he gives <b>all of</b> the property to his two slaves, then each slave <b>did not acquire</b> himself, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to state in the second clause that this is true when one gives <b>half</b> of his property to one slave and <b>half</b> of it to the other?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>If it is due to that</b> reason, <b>there is no</b> conclusive <b>argument.</b> One could say that the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught the latter clause to shed light on the first clause, so that you do not say: The first clause</b> is discussing only a case <b>where one said</b> that he gives <b>half</b> of his property to one slave and <b>half</b> to the other, <b>but</b> if <b>one said</b> that he gives <b>all of it</b> to both of them, then <b>they did acquire</b> the property. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught the latter clause,</b> where it explicitly discusses a case <b>where he said</b> that he gives <b>half</b> to one and <b>half</b> to the other, and <b>by inference</b> it is clear <b>that the first clause</b> must be discussing a case <b>where he said</b> that he gives <b>all of it</b> to both of them, <b>and even so they did not acquire</b> the property.",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that it is <b>not difficult.</b> It is possible to reconcile the two <i>baraitot</i> differently: <b>Here,</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, where they did not acquire the property, this is a case where the master wrote everything <b>in one document.</b> The reason the slaves do not acquire themselves is that it is not possible to emancipate two slaves with one document. <b>There,</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, which rules that they did acquire the property, the case is one where the master wrote the transfer of property <b>in two documents.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: If the second <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case where he wrote everything <b>in one document, why specifically</b> mention that the slaves do not acquire themselves when he gave <b>half</b> to one and <b>half</b> to the other? <b>Even if he said all of it as well, they did not acquire</b> the property, as was taught explicitly in the beginning of the <i>baraita</i>. The Gemara answers: <b>That is also what</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying: They did not acquire even themselves. In what</b> case is <b>this statement said?</b> In a case where the master wrote everything <b>in one document. But</b> if he wrote it <b>in two documents, they acquired</b> the property. <b>And if</b> the master <b>said</b> that he gives <b>half</b> to one and <b>half</b> to the other, then <b>even</b> if he wrote it <b>in two documents they also did not acquire</b> the property.",

            "The Gemara questions this explanation: <b>Granted,</b> if the master gave the documents sequentially, <b>the last</b> slave <b>did not acquire, for the first</b> slave <b>had already acquired him,</b> as the second slave was among the possessions transferred via the first document. <b>However, the first</b> slave <b>should acquire himself and should</b> also <b>acquire the other</b> slave, as he was given all of the property in one document.

            "<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The contradiction between the <i>baraitot</i> can be resolved by noting that <b>it is different there,</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, <b>because</b> the master <b>calls them: My slaves.</b> By writing: All of my property is given to so-and-so and so-and-so my slaves, he indicates that he does not intend to free them. <b>Rafram said to Rav Ashi: But perhaps</b> when he says: <b>My slaves,</b> he is referring to those <b>who were</b> his slaves <b>in the past.</b>",
            "Rafram attempts to prove that the expression my slaves can be used in this manner. <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Pe’a</i> 3:8): In the case of <b>one who writes all of his property to his slave,</b> i.e., gives it to him via a document, the slave <b>has been emancipated.</b> But if <b>he reserved</b> for himself even <b>any amount of land,</b> then <b>he has not been emancipated.

            "§ If a half-slave half-freeman, who works for himself and his master on alternating days, <b>was gored by an ox</b> and damaged, then, if he was gored on <b>the day of his master,</b> the reimbursement for the damage caused is paid <b>to his master.</b> If it was <b>on his</b> own <b>day,</b> it is paid <b>to</b> the slave <b>himself.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>However, if that is so,</b> if he is viewed as entering and leaving a state of slavery each day, then <b>on the day of his master he should</b> be able to <b>marry a maidservant</b> and on <b>his</b> own <b>day he should</b> be able to <b>marry a free woman.</b> However, the mishna states that he cannot marry anyone.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that this is referring to a case <b>where</b> the slave <b>was struck by a person,</b> not an ox, so that the one who struck him must pay for the loss of livelihood. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: This <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> merely <b>a statement</b> of an <i>amora</i>, <b>and Rava</b> is <b>not</b> bound to <b>hold in accordance</b> with <b>a statement</b> of an <i>amora</i>.",

The <i>halakha</i> is that if one <b>planned</b> to perform <b>his labor on</b> the intermediate days of <b>the Festival, and he died,</b> then <b>his child is not penalized after him, because</b> the son <b>did not perform a prohibited</b> act. <b>Here, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Did <b>the Sages penalize</b> only <b>him, and he is no longer</b> alive, <b>or perhaps the Sages penalized his property,</b> by saying that he should lose it, <b>and</b> his property still <b>exists?</b>",
            "Rabbi Asi <b>said to him: You</b> already <b>learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shevi’it</i> 4:2): <b>A field whose thorns were removed during the Sabbatical</b> Year <b>may be sown after the conclusion of the Sabbatical</b> Year, since removing thorns is not full-fledged labor that renders the produce of the field prohibited. And it is taught in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Shevi’it</i> 3:6): If <b>it had been improved</b> with fertilizer, <b>or</b> if <b>it had been populated</b> by the owner’s herd in order to fertilize the field with their manure, <b>it may not be sown after the conclusion of the Sabbatical</b> Year, for the Sages imposed a penalty to prevent one from benefiting from prohibited labor.",
            "<b>And Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: We have a tradition</b> that if one <b>improved</b> his field in a forbidden manner, <b>and</b> then <b>died, his son may sow it.

            "<b>Abaye said: We have a tradition</b> that if someone <b>defiled his friend’s ritually pure items,</b> thereby incurring liability to pay for the damage that he caused, <b>and died</b> before paying, the Sages <b>did not penalize his son after him</b> to pay for the damage. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Damage that is not evident,</b> i.e., that does not involve any physical change to the goods that is visible to the eye, <b>is not considered damage</b> by Torah law; <b>but</b> since the other party did suffer a loss, there <b>is a penalty of the Sages.

            "<b>And</b> the Gemara notes that this distinction <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Avoda Zara</i> 3:18): <b>The slave follows his master to Syria.</b> The Gemara asks: Must <b>he follow</b> him?

The intention of the guarantor <b>is performing a mitzva</b> of facilitating a marriage by encouraging the woman to consent to the marriage as a result of his involvement, but he does not truly intend to obligate himself. <b>And</b> furthermore, the woman <b>does not lose</b> anything in exchange for which the guarantor would accept responsibility, as the husband does not borrow money from the woman. Therefore, the Sages instituted that the guarantor does not become responsible for payment of the marriage contract from his own property.",
            "<b>Ravina said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof concerning the question of whether the mishna’s ruling that payment of a woman’s marriage contract is collected from inferior-quality land applies only when the woman collects from orphans or if it applies even when she collects from her husband. The proof is <b>from the beginning of our ordinance:</b> Why did the Sages say that a woman’s marriage contract is collected from inferior-quality land? It is because <b>more than a man wants to marry</b> a woman, <b>a woman wants to become married</b> to a man. <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies only when the woman collects <b>from orphans,</b> then the reason given for <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> should be that it is <b>because they are orphans,</b> not because a woman wants to become married. This indicates that the mishna’s ruling applies even when she collects her marriage contract during her husband’s lifetime, contrary to the opinion of Mar Zutra. The Gemara affirms: <b>The refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Mar Zutra is a conclusive refutation.</b>",
            "§ Apropos a statement attributed to Mar Zutra, son of Rav Naḥman, the Gemara cites another <i>halakha</i> in his name on a similar topic: <b>Mar Zutra, son of Rav Naḥman, said in the name of Rav Naḥman:</b> If <b>a promissory note is presented to orphans</b> for repayment of a loan taken by their father, then <b>although an enhancement</b> of the creditor’s ability to collect, enabling the collection of even superior-value land, <b>is written in it,</b> the creditor <b>can collect only from inferior-quality land.</b>",
            "<b>Abaye said: Know</b> that this is the case, <b>as</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> governing <b>a creditor</b> is that he collects <b>from intermediate-quality land, but from orphans</b> he collects only <b>from inferior-quality land.</b> If one cannot collect even from intermediate-quality land of orphans, all the more so one cannot collect from their superior-quality land.",
            "<b>Rava said to him: How can</b> these two cases <b>be compared? By Torah law,</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> governing <b>a creditor</b> is that he collects <b>from inferior-quality land, in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Ulla, as Ulla says: By Torah law, a creditor</b> collects <b>from inferior-quality land, as it is stated: “You shall stand outside, and the man</b> to whom you have lent shall bring forth the pledge out to you” (Deuteronomy 24:11). <b>What would a man ordinarily take out</b> as a pledge? <b>The least</b> valuable <b>of</b> his <b>vessels.</b> This demonstrates that the creditor is entitled only to the least valuable of the debtor’s vessels. Similarly, when he collects from land, he collects only from inferior-quality land. <b>And for what reason did</b> the Sages <b>say</b> that <b>a creditor</b> collects <b>from intermediate-quality land? So as not to lock the door before</b> potential <b>borrowers,</b> i.e., so that people do not refrain from extending loans. <b>And with regard to orphans, the Sages left</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>as</b> it is stated <b>in the Torah.</b>",
            "<b>But here,</b> a stipulation enhancing the creditor’s ability to collect was included in the promissory note. Therefore, <b>since by Torah law the <i>halakha</i></b> governing this creditor is that he collects <b>from superior-quality land</b> as stipulated in the loan agreement, then <b>he should also</b> collect <b>from superior-quality land even</b> when collecting the debt <b>from orphans.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> this explanation of <b>Rava,</b> there is a difficulty: <b>Didn’t</b> the Sage <b>Avram Ḥoza’a teach</b> a <i>baraita</i> that states: A father’s debt <b>can be collected from the property of the orphans only from inferior-quality land?</b> The Gemara infers: <b>And</b> this ruling applies <b>even</b> if the property is collected for payment to <b>injured</b> parties. <b>But isn’t</b> it true that <b>by Torah law</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> governing <b>injured</b> parties is that they collect <b>from superior-quality land?</b> This indicates that even when by Torah law collection should be from superior-quality land, the Sages instituted that one may collect from orphans only inferior-quality land.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>With what</b> case <b>are we dealing here</b> in the <i>baraita</i> taught by Avram Ḥoza’a? We are dealing with a case <b>where superior-quality land of the injured</b> party <b>is equal</b> in quality <b>to inferior-quality land of the one who caused the damage,</b> i.e., the orphans, and the one who caused the damage also has land of superior quality.",
            "<b>And</b> the <i>baraita</i> is taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, who says: By Torah law we appraise</b> the property <b>of the injured</b> party, and therefore the one who caused the damage can pay with his inferior-quality fields that are equal in quality to the superior-quality land owned by the injured party. <b>And for the betterment of the world, the Sages instituted</b> that we appraise the property <b>of the one who caused the damage,</b> and he pays with his superior-quality land. <b>But with regard to orphans, the Sages left</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>as</b> it is stated <b>in the Torah;</b> they pay from their inferior-quality land that is equal in quality to superior-quality land belonging to the injured party. By contrast, a creditor who holds a promissory note stipulating that the debt can be collected from superior-quality land can collect superior-quality land even from orphans, as stipulated in the loan agreement.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rabbi Eliezer Nayota’a teach</b> a <i>baraita</i> that states: A father’s debt <b>can be collected from the property of the orphans only from inferior-quality land, even if it is superior-quality land?</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>Even if it is superior-quality land? Is it not</b> the following: <b>Although superior-quality land is written in the</b> promissory <b>note,</b> the debt can be collected from the orphans only from inferior-quality land.",
            "The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No, what</b> is the meaning of <b>superior-quality land?</b> Orphans can repay the debt even from <b>strips of superior-quality land</b> that due to their location cannot be cultivated or guarded and that consequently have a lower market value than inferior-quality land, <b>as</b> in the statement <b>of Rava.</b>",
            "<b>As Rava says:</b> If <b>one damaged inferior-quality land,</b> the injured party <b>collects from superior-quality land.</b> The one who caused damage is penalized and made to pay from land of much higher quality than that which he damaged. If he damaged <b>strips of superior-quality land</b> that cannot be cultivated, the injured party <b>collects from intermediate-quality land,</b> as the land that was damaged is inferior in value even to inferior-quality land, and therefore it suffices if compensation is paid from intermediate-quality land. And why did Rabbi Eliezer Nayota’a teach that orphans may pay their father’s debt from land of the lowest quality? <b>With regard to orphans, the Sages left</b> the <i>halakha</i> as it is written <b>in the Torah,</b> that a creditor collects from inferior-quality land.",
            "§ The mishna teaches: If one who owed money died and his children inherited his property, the father’s debt <b>can be collected from the property of the orphans only from inferior-quality land. Rav Aḥadevoi bar Ami raised a dilemma</b> with regard to the meaning of this statement: Do the <b>orphans of which they spoke</b> refer specifically to <b>minors or even</b> to <b>adults?</b> The Gemara explains the two sides of the dilemma: Is <b>this an ordinance that the Sages instituted for</b> the benefit of the <b>orphans,</b> in which case it may be argued that <b>the Sages instituted</b> it <b>for minors</b> but <b>they did not institute</b> it <b>for adults?</b>",
            "<b>Or, perhaps</b> the reason is different. The reason that a creditor collects from intermediate-quality land is so that the door not be locked before potential borrowers. Here, this is not a concern, <b>since it does not enter the mind of the creditor</b> that he should not lend money as perhaps <b>the borrower</b> will <b>die and</b> his <b>property will fall to the orphans. As</b> only if he were to consider this possibility, would it be <b>that this would lock the door</b> before potential borrowers. Consequently, the ordinance that a creditor collects from intermediate-quality land was instituted only in the standard case, where the creditor collects from the debtor himself, but not where he collects from the heirs. <b>Therefore,</b> the ordinance that a debt can be collected from the property of orphans only from inferior-quality land should apply <b>also</b> to <b>adult</b> orphans.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear what Abaye the Elder taught:</b> With regard to <b>the orphans of which</b> the Sages <b>spoke,</b> the phrase is referring to <b>adults, and needless to say</b> it is referring also to <b>minors.</b>",
            "The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>But perhaps this statement applies only to the matter of an oath.</b> One who collects a debt from property left by the debtor to his heirs always takes an oath, even if he produces a promissory note.

The reason is that the second gift is considered to be unsold property in relation to the first gift because, when the first gift was given, the second gift was still in the donor’s possession.",
            "The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are not dealing here with a person on his deathbed who is distributing monetary gifts, but rather <b>with</b> a debtor who is dividing his money between his various <b>creditors.</b> The Gemara raises an objection: <b>But didn’t</b> the person on his deathbed <b>say: Give</b> the money to so-and-so, a formulation that indicates that he is granting a gift?

            "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The second</b> daughter <b>forfeited</b> her one-tenth of the estate, and therefore she cannot demand that she should first receive one-tenth of the estate as her dowry, as did her sister, and that only afterward they divide what remains of the estate equally between themselves. <b>And Rabbi Ḥanina said to him:</b> Did <b>they</b> not <b>say</b> even <b>more than this,</b> that if the brother sold off property belonging to his father’s estate, payment for the daughter’s <b>dowry can be appropriated</b> from the buyer, <b>but</b> payment for her <b>sustenance cannot be appropriated</b> from him? If the father’s estate is liened to his daughter’s dowry, so that she can collect her dowry even from a third party who bought the property from the son, she should be able to collect it from her father’s estate before it is divided up between the daughters. <b>And you say</b> that the <b>second</b> daughter <b>forfeited</b> her one-tenth of the estate?",

If purchasers are at risk of losing the land they purchased to pay debts of the seller that had not been written, they will have no way to protect themselves, and no one will purchase land.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yosei said: And what betterment of the world is there in this,</b> in stating that the reason the land is not appropriated is only because the debt was not written? <b>But isn’t</b> the real reason that these obligations cannot be collected from liened property is that <b>they are not</b> of <b>a fixed</b> amount? No one would be willing to purchase land if the land were liened to an unlimited debt.

Since the finder says that he found only half of what the owner claims was lost, he is treated like someone who admits to part of a claim and therefore takes an oath.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But does Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov not maintain</b> that <b>someone who returns a lost item is exempt</b> from an oath? <b>Rav says:</b> The case in dispute between Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov and the Rabbis is not one where nobody has claimed anything from the borrower, as in such a case all agree that the borrower is exempt from taking an oath. Rather, it is a case <b>where</b> the creditor has died, leaving a child as his heir, and this <b>minor</b> confronts the borrower and <b>claims</b> a hundred dinars <b>from him,</b> which he alleges was lent by his late father.

But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Shevuot</i> 38b): <b>One does not take an oath</b> in response <b>to the claim of a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor,</b> as the claim of one who lacks halakhic competence has no significance whatsoever. According to this, if a minor brought a claim against the borrower, it is as though there were no claim at all but only the borrower’s admission, and so the borrower should be exempt from taking an oath.",
            "The Gemara answers: To <b>which</b> kind of <b>minor</b> was Rav referring? It was to <b>an adult</b> son of the creditor. <b>And why does</b> Rav <b>call him a minor,</b> if he is in fact an adult? It is <b>as with regard to his father’s affairs he is</b> like <b>a minor.</b> He does not know with certainty how much money the borrower repaid but merely says that he thinks he owes his father more.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> that we are dealing with a case where the deceased creditor’s adult son made a claim against the debtor, how can Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov say about this claim that it is his own claim? Is this an oath taken about <b>his own claim? It is</b> an oath taken about <b>the claim of others,</b> i.e., the son. The Gemara answers: Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov calls it an oath taken about one’s own claim, although it is really <b>the claim of others,</b> because it is <b>his own admission</b> that obligates him to take the oath.",
            "The Gemara objects: <b>All claims</b> that lead to the oath of one who admits to part of the claim <b>are also</b> a combination of <b>the claim of others and</b> the defendant’s <b>own admission. Rather,</b> Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov and the Rabbis <b>disagree with regard to</b> the following explanation given by <b>Rabba, as Rabba says: For what reason did the Torah say</b> that one who <b>admits to part of the claim</b> brought against him <b>takes an oath</b> with regard to the rest of the claim, which he denies, whereas one who denies the entire claim is not required to take an oath? Rabba answers: The oath of partial admission is based on a <b>presumption</b> with regard to the defendant’s behavior. There is a presumption <b>that a person would not be so brazen</b> as to stand <b>before his creditor</b> and deny his debt when his creditor knows that he is lying.",
            "Rabba continues: <b>And this</b> one who admits to part of the claim would <b>want to deny all of it, and</b> the only reason <b>he does not deny</b> all of <b>it is because a person would not be so brazen before his creditor. And</b> in fact, he would <b>want to admit</b> to <b>all</b> of the claim <b>to him. And</b> the reason <b>that he did not admit</b> the whole claim <b>to him</b> and say that in fact he owes him the entire sum is that <b>he was evading</b> his obligation temporarily. The debtor is short of money and <b>he thinks:</b> I will pay my creditor as much as I can afford now, and I will evade paying the rest <b>until I have</b> enough <b>money, and</b> then <b>I will repay him</b> the rest, to which I have not yet admitted. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One states: Impose an oath on</b> the debtor <b>in order</b> to induce him <b>to admit all</b> of the debt <b>to</b> the creditor.",
            "Following Rabba’s reasoning, the difference of opinion between Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov and the Rabbis can be explained as follows: <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov holds</b> that <b>there is no difference between</b> the creditor <b>himself and</b> the creditor’s <b>son,</b> as in all cases the debtor <b>would not be so brazen</b> as to deny his debt. <b>Therefore,</b> the debtor <b>is not</b> considered like <b>someone who is returning a lost item.</b> Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov maintains that Rabba’s reasoning applies in this case as well, so he is required to take an oath. <b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>he would not be so brazen</b> as to deny a debt before the creditor <b>himself, but</b> toward <b>his</b> creditor’s <b>son he would be brazen</b> and deny the claim completely. <b>And since he was not so brazen</b> as to deny the entire claim, but admitted to part of it, <b>he is</b> considered like <b>someone returning a lost item,</b> and therefore he is exempt from taking an oath."

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that a steward is obligated to tithe the produce of the orphans in his charge. The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i> that expounds a verse dealing with the <i>teruma</i> of the tithe, given by a Levite to a priest: “Thus you, also you, shall offer a gift to the Lord” (Numbers 18:28). The emphasis placed on the word “you” teaches as follows: <b>“You”</b> separate <i>teruma</i>, <b>but not partners,</b> meaning that one partner may not separate <i>teruma</i> on behalf of the other. <b>“You”</b> separate <i>teruma</i>, <b>but not sharecroppers. “You”</b> separate <i>teruma</i>, <b>but not stewards,</b> and “you” separate <i>teruma</i>, <b>but not one who separates <i>teruma</i> from</b> produce <b>that is not his.</b> How, then, can the mishna say that a steward is able to, and is even required to, tithe the produce of the orphans in his charge, when that produce does not belong to him?",
            "<b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> that this is <b>not difficult: Here</b> the mishna is dealing with a steward who tithes the orphans’ produce in order <b>to feed</b> it to them. Since he is not permitted to feed them untithed produce, the Sages allowed him to tithe that which he gives them to eat. <b>There</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to produce that is not needed for the orphans’ sustenance; rather, the steward wishes <b>to put</b> it <b>aside</b> in a tithed state. Since he is not the owner of the produce, he lacks the authority to tithe it.",
            "<b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Terumot</i> 1:10) that this distinction is made based on whether the steward intends to feed the produce to the orphans or store it: <b>Stewards can separate <i>teruma</i> and tithes</b> from the produce of the orphans in their charge in order <b>to feed</b> the produce to them, <b>but not</b> with the intention <b>to put</b> it <b>aside.

Since the buyers pulled the orphans’ property into their possession, thereby performing an act of acquisition, the sale is valid and the buyers cannot retract.",

            "Consequently, Rabbi Meir adds: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that <b>alternatively,</b> the difference between Shabbat and the Sabbatical Year can be explained as follows: <b>Jews are suspected of</b> desecrating <b>the Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>but they are not suspected of</b> desecrating <b>Shabbat.</b> Therefore, Rabbi Meir imposes a penalty for the unintentional desecration of the Sabbatical Year, but not for the unintentional desecration of Shabbat.",
            "The Gemara continues: And there is also <b>no contradiction</b> between one statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> with regard to the Sabbatical Year <b>and</b> the other statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> with regard to Shabbat. This is because <b>in Rabbi Yehuda’s place</b> the prohibition against desecrating <b>the Sabbatical</b> Year <b>was</b> regarded <b>by them</b> as a most <b>serious</b> one, and therefore there was no need to impose a penalty for its unintentional desecration, although it is a Torah law.",

            "The Gemara proceeds to discuss another apparent contradiction between rulings of Rabbi Meir with regard to penalties imposed for the unintentional transgression of a rabbinic law: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> what was taught in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Terumot</i> 7:7): If <b>one partook of <i>teruma</i>,</b>which is the property of a priest, and it was ritually <b>impure, he pays</b> restitution with ritually <b>pure, non-sacred</b> produce. <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if <b>he paid</b> restitution with ritually <b>impure, non-sacred</b> produce? <b>Sumakhos said in the name of Rabbi Meir:</b> If he paid restitution with ritually impure, non-sacred produce <b>unintentionally, his payment is valid.</b> But if he did so <b>intentionally, his payment is not valid.

            "<b>And we discussed</b> the following question concerning the opinion of Rabbi Meir: In the case where he paid restitution with ritually impure, non-sacred produce <b>intentionally, why is his payment not valid?</b> On the contrary, <b>blessing should come upon him, as he partook of something that is not fit for</b> the priest to partake of even <b>during the days of his impurity,</b> since it is prohibited for a priest to partake of impure <i>teruma</i>, whether he himself is pure or impure, <b>and he pays</b> restitution <b>to him with something,</b> i.e., impure, non-sacred produce, <b>which is</b> at least <b>fit for him</b> to partake of <b>during the days of his impurity.</b>",
            "<b>And Rava said, and some say it</b> is <b>unattributed:</b> The <i>baraita</i> <b>is incomplete and this is what it is teaching:</b> If <b>one partook of</b> ritually <b>impure <i>teruma</i>, he can pay</b> restitution with <b>anything,</b> even impure, non-sacred produce.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared?

            "The Gemara attempts to adduce further proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> what was taught in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 2:3): With regard to <b>one who tithes</b> produce <b>on Shabbat,</b> which is prohibited by rabbinic law because it appears as though he were repairing an article that requires repair, if he did this <b>unintentionally, he may consume</b> the produce, as it has been tithed and rendered fit for consumption.

But if the animal becomes his only when he consecrates it, he is required to return them. <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rava then said,</b> in answer to his own question: <b>It stands to reason</b> that the Sages placed the animal in his possession <b>from the time of the consecration.</b> This is <b>so that the sinner not profit</b> from his crime.

            "The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>But</b> that <b>is not so,</b> i.e., this cannot serve as a proof to the matter at hand. <b>There,</b> it is <b>lacking</b> part <b>of the matter</b> it is addressing, as a sheet of parchment is missing, whereas <b>here, it is not lacking</b> part <b>of the matter</b> it is addressing, as it contains a complete book. <b>Rabba and Rav Yosef both say: One does not read from <i>ḥumashim</i> in the synagogue out of respect for the community.</b>",
            "<b>And Rabba and Rav Yosef both say: It is prohibited to</b> publicly <b>read</b> the <i>haftara</i>, the portion from the Prophets that is read after the weekly Torah portion, <b>on Shabbat, from a scroll</b> containing only <b>the <i>haftarot</i>. What is the reason</b> for this? It is <b>because</b> this type of scroll <b>may not be written,</b> as the words of the Prophets must also be written as complete books.",
            "<b>Mar bar Rav Ashi said: To handle</b> such a scroll on Shabbat <b>is also prohibited. What is the reason</b> for this? It is <b>because it is not fit to be read.</b> Consequently, it is treated as set-aside [<i>muktze</i>] on Shabbat. The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>But</b> that <b>is not so;</b> rather, <b>it is permitted to handle</b> such a scroll <b>and it is permitted to read from it.</b>",
            "And a proof for this is <b>that Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish used to read from a scroll of <i>aggada</i></b> containing the words of the Sages <b>on Shabbat. But</b> such a scroll <b>may not be written,</b> for in principle, the statements of the Oral Law may not be committed to writing. <b>Rather, since it is not possible</b> to remember the Oral Law without writing it down, it is permitted to violate the <i>halakha</i>, as indicated by the verse: <b>“It is time to act for the Lord; they have nullified your Torah”</b> (Psalms 119:126). <b>Here too,</b> in the case of a <i>haftara</i> scroll, <b>since it is not</b> always <b>possible</b> to write complete books of the Bible, due to the expense, it is permitted to apply the reasoning of <b>“It is time to act for the Lord; they have nullified your Torah.”</b>",

            "The Gemara explains the two sides of the dilemma according to each opinion: <b>Let the dilemma be raised according to the one who says</b> that <b>the Torah was given scroll by scroll.</b> On the one hand it is possible to say that <b>since</b> the Torah <b>was</b> originally <b>given scroll by scroll,</b> today as well <b>one may write</b> the Torah in separate scrolls. <b>Or</b> on the other hand, <b>perhaps</b> one should say that <b>since it was</b> ultimately <b>joined</b> together to form a single scroll, <b>it was joined</b> together and can no longer be written in separate scrolls.",

            "Abaye <b>raised an objection to his</b> opinion from a mishna (<i>Yoma</i> 37b) where it was taught: Queen Helene <b>also fashioned a golden tablet</b> as a gift for the Temple <b>on which the</b> Torah <b>portion</b> discussing <b>a <i>sota</i> was written.</b> When the priest would write the scroll of a <i>sota</i> in the Temple, he would copy this Torah portion from the tablet, so that a Torah scroll need not be taken out for that purpose.

            "The Gemara <b>raised an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> that teaches: <b>When</b> the priest <b>writes</b> the <i>sota</i> scroll, <b>he looks</b> at <b>and writes that which is written on the tablet,</b> which indicates that the full text of the passage was written on the tablet. The Gemara rejects this argument: Emend the <i>baraita</i> and <b>say</b> that it should read as follows: He looks at and writes <b>like that which is written on the tablet.</b> The tablet aids the priest in remembering the text that must actually be written.",

Therefore, this contribution of Queen Helene does not resolve the question of whether writing a scroll for a child is permitted.",
            "The Gemara comments: The question of whether or not writing a scroll for a child is permitted is <b>subject to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is taught in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not write a scroll</b> containing only one portion of the Torah <b>for</b> the purpose of enabling <b>a child to study, but if</b> the writer’s <b>intention is to complete</b> the scroll, <b>it is permitted.

            "The Gemara elaborates: <b>Rav Huna said</b> that <b>the husband is deemed credible, as, if it is so that he gave it to</b> the third party <b>for</b> the purpose of <b>divorce, he would have given</b> the bill of divorce directly <b>to her.</b> Both husband and wife are in the same city. Why did he give it to a third party? Apparently, he merely entrusted him with the bill of divorce for safekeeping. <b>And Rav Ḥisda said: The third party is deemed credible, as</b> the husband himself <b>deemed him credible</b> by entrusting him with the bill of divorce.",
            "<b>Rabbi Abba raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rav Huna from a <i>baraita</i> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 1:10): The legal status of <b>the admission of a litigant is similar to</b> that of the testimony of <b>one hundred witnesses, and</b> the statement of <b>a third party is deemed</b> more <b>credible than</b> the statements of <b>both of</b> the litigants. <b>How so?</b> If <b>this</b> litigant, the creditor, <b>says</b> that the debtor owes him <b>this</b> sum, <b>and that</b> litigant, the debtor, <b>says</b> that he owes <b>that</b> lower sum, the <b>third party</b> to whom the debtor gave the money to pay the creditor is <b>deemed credible</b> to establish the sum of the debt. This contradicts the opinion of Rav Huna, who said that the husband, not the third party, is deemed credible.",
            "The Gemara rejects that objection: <b>A monetary</b> debt <b>is different, as it can be forgiven.</b> Since one can forgive a monetary debt outright, he can also accept upon himself to abide by the statement of a third party as to the sum of the debt. Therefore, even if the third party deviates from the truth, because it is a case involving money, they accept his determination. However, no proof may be cited from that case to the matter of the bill of divorce, as there is no possibility of forgiveness with regard to ritual matters, e.g., divorce.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>And likewise</b> that is the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to bills of divorce [<i>gittin</i>],</b> i.e., the <i>halakha</i> is that the third party is deemed credible? The Gemara answers: The reference in the <i>baraita</i> is not to bills of divorce. Rather, the reference is to <b>monetary documents [<i>gittei mamon</i>].</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>And likewise</b> that is the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to</b> monetary <b>documents [<i>shetarot</i>]?</b> The fact that monetary documents are labeled as <i>shetarot</i> indicates that the term <i>gittin</i> refers to bill of divorce.",
            "The Gemara rejects that proof: <b>Are they,</b> the two expressions, <b>taught together?</b> If there were a passage in one <i>baraita</i> that said: And likewise, that is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <i>gittin</i> and documents, one could infer that the term <i>gittin</i> is referring to bills of divorce, as the term documents is referring to all other documents. However, since these are two discrete <i>baraitot</i>, perhaps one is referring to monetary documents as <i>gittin</i> and the other is referring to them as <i>shetarot</i>.",
            "The Gemara cites proof with regard to the credibility of the third party. <b>We learned</b> in the mishna that <b>a woman who said</b> to an agent: <b>Receive my bill of divorce for me, requires two sets of witnesses</b> to confirm that she was divorced when the agent received the bill of divorce. She requires <b>two</b> witnesses <b>who say: In our presence she said</b> to the agent: Receive my bill of divorce on my behalf, <b>and two</b> others <b>who say: In our presence</b> the agent <b>received</b> the bill of divorce <b>and tore</b> it. The Gemara asks: <b>And why</b> are the witnesses necessary? <b>Let us deem the third party,</b> to whom the husband handed the bill of divorce, <b>credible</b> and not require witnesses.",
            "The Gemara rejects this: <b>Does the bill of divorce emerge from his possession,</b> i.e., does he have the bill of divorce, such <b>that</b> it would lead one <b>to deem him credible?</b> The third party is believed only in a case where the item in question is under his control, as then he can do with it as he wishes. However, in this case the bill of divorce is no longer in his possession, as it has been torn, and the credibility attributed to the third party is no longer relevant.",
            "The Gemara asks: That <b>works out well</b> in explaining why witnesses are required to testify that <b>she said</b> to the agent in their presence: Receive my bill of divorce on my behalf. However, <b>why do I</b> need witnesses to testify: In our presence the agent <b>received</b> the bill of divorce and tore it? From the point that the bill of divorce was in his possession no testimony should be necessary. <b>Rabba said:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar,</b> who <b>says: Witnesses of transmission</b> of the bill of divorce <b>effect</b> the divorce. The divorce takes effect primarily by means of its transmission to the woman in the presence of witnesses. Therefore, witnesses are necessary to testify that the transmission took place in their presence.",
            "The Gemara seeks to clarify a different matter mentioned in the mishna. <b>Why do I</b> need the witnesses to testify that the third party <b>tore</b> the bill of divorce? <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> the mishna <b>during a period of</b> religious <b>persecution,</b> when the government decreed that it is prohibited to write bills of divorce. Therefore, immediately after the divorce took effect they would destroy any evidence that a bill of divorce had been written by tearing it.",
            "<b>Rabba said: And</b> although he said that the husband is deemed credible, <b>Rav Huna concedes that if</b> the wife <b>said:</b> The <b>third party said to me</b> that my husband <b>gave</b> the bill of divorce <b>to him for</b> the purpose of <b>divorce, she is deemed credible.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is there anything</b> with regard to which, according to Rav Huna, <b>the third party himself is not deemed credible, but</b> the wife <b>is deemed credible</b> when quoting him?",
            "<b>Rather,</b> Rabba said that Rav Huna concedes that <b>if she said: In my presence</b> my husband <b>gave</b> the bill of divorce <b>to</b> the third party <b>for</b> the purpose of <b>divorce, she is deemed credible.</b> Her credibility is based on the principle of <b><i>miggo</i>,</b> that the ability to make a more advantageous claim grants credibility to the claim one actually makes. <b>Since, if she wished, she</b> could have <b>said</b> that <b>the husband gave it to her</b> and she was divorced, therefore, when she says that the husband gave it to an agent for the purpose of divorce she is deemed credible.",
            "§ The Gemara proceeds to a related matter. If the <b>husband said</b> that he gave the bill of divorce to the third party as an agent of delivery <b>for</b> the purpose of <b>divorce, and</b> the <b>third party says</b> that the husband gave it to him as an agent of delivery <b>for</b> the purpose of <b>divorce, and</b> the wife <b>says:</b> The third party <b>gave me</b> the bill of divorce <b>and</b> it <b>was lost, Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> This <b>is</b> uncertainty with regard to <b>a matter of forbidden relations. And</b> there is <b>no</b> resolution of a <b>matter of forbidden relations</b> with <b>fewer than two</b> witnesses.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But why</b> is this case one of uncertainty? <b>But let us deem the third party credible,</b> i.e., let us believe his statement that the husband gave him the bill of divorce for the purpose of divorce. The Gemara rejects this: <b>Does the bill of divorce emerge from his possession,</b> such <b>that</b> it would lead one <b>to deem him credible?</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But let</b> one <b>deem the husband credible, as Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: A husband who says: I divorced my wife, is deemed credible.</b> The Gemara rejects this: In the case under discussion <b>does</b> the husband <b>say: I divorced</b> her? He merely stated that he handed the bill of divorce to the third party.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But let us say</b> that there is <b>a presumption</b> that <b>an agent performs his</b> assigned <b>agency, as Rabbi Yitzḥak says</b> that in the case of <b>one who says to his agent: Go out and betroth a woman for me,</b> and he did <b>not specify</b> which woman, <b>and his agent died</b> without informing him whether he betrothed a woman or the identity of the woman he betrothed, it is <b>prohibited</b> for him to marry <b>all the women in the world,</b> as there is <b>a presumption</b> that <b>an agent performs his</b> assigned <b>agency.</b> Apparently, one relies on this presumption even with regard to matters of forbidden relations. Because the identity of the woman is unknown, one must be concerned with regard to all women; perhaps they are relatives of the woman whom the agent betrothed on his behalf."
        ],
        [
            "The Gemara answers: <b>This matter,</b> the presumption that an agent performs his agency, applies only when its application leads <b>to stringency,</b> as there is a concern that the agent performed his agency. <b>However,</b> when its application leads <b>to leniency, no,</b> the presumption does not apply.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But let</b> one <b>deem the wife herself credible,</b> based <b>on</b> the statement of <b>Rav Hamnuna, as Rav Hamnuna says:</b> A <b>woman who said to her husband: You divorced me, is deemed credible,</b> as there is <b>a presumption</b> that <b>a woman</b> would <b>not be insolent in the presence of her husband</b> and lie.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>This matter applies only</b> in a case <b>where there is no</b> factor <b>that supports her</b> claim, as the presumption is that she would not be so insolent as to tell a lie that has no basis. <b>However,</b> in a case <b>where</b> there is a factor <b>that supports her</b> claim, as in this case both the husband and the third party claim that the husband sent a bill of divorce, <b>she</b> would <b>indeed be insolent.</b> Therefore, her claim that she was divorced is accepted only if she can produce the bill of divorce.",

            "The Gemara elaborates: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Reish Lakish?

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan also could compare him to one who is sleeping,</b> so why does he not do so? The Gemara answers: <b>One who is sleeping is not lacking an action,</b> meaning that no action is needed in order to awaken him, and he can awaken on his own. <b>This</b> one, who is afflicted with temporary insanity, is <b>lacking an action</b> by not taking the remedy mentioned earlier.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And Reish Lakish could also compare him to an imbecile,</b> so why does he not do so?

By contrast, for <b>this</b> one, who is afflicted with temporary insanity, <b>there is a remedy in our possession.</b> As the Gemara explained (67b): The remedy for this disease is for the afflicted person to eat lean <b>red meat</b> roasted <b>over coals and</b> drink <b>wine</b> that has been <b>diluted</b> with a large amount of water.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But did Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> actually <b>say this,</b> that the court must wait for him to regain his mental capabilities? <b>But didn’t Rav Yehuda say</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> If one was attacked by another who <b>slit</b> his throat and severed the <b>two</b> pipes, his trachea and esophagus, <b>or the majority of</b> the <b>two</b> pipes, <b>and</b> the dying man <b>signaled and</b> thereby <b>stated</b> through his gestures: <b>Write a bill of divorce for my wife,</b> then <b>those</b> present <b>should write and give</b> a bill of divorce to his wife?",

By contrast, if the husband is a deaf-mute or an imbecile then he cannot divorce her by Torah law.

The verse states: “And gives it,”</b> indicating that she is divorced <b>in any case,</b> regardless of the manner in which he gives her the bill of divorce.",
            "<b>And that is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to a thief.</b> It is written: “If the theft be found <b>in his hand”</b> (Exodus 22:3), from which <b>I have</b> derived that one is liable for theft <b>only</b> when the stolen item was found in <b>his hand.</b> But <b>from where</b> do I derive that one is liable for theft even if it was found on <b>his roof,</b> in <b>his courtyard, or</b> in <b>his enclosure,</b> i.e., if the item reached his domain and he secured it with the intent to steal it? <b>The verse states: “If</b> the theft <b>be found,”</b> indicating that he is liable <b>in any case,</b> whether it was found in his hand or in his domain.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> in both cases. <b>As if</b> the Torah <b>had taught us</b> only with regard to <b>a bill of divorce,</b> one could have said: <b>Because</b> a husband <b>divorces</b> his wife <b>against her will,</b> the divorce is effective regardless of how the husband places the document in her possession. <b>But a thief, who is not</b> accountable for theft that he performs <b>against his will, say no,</b> he is liable only when he actually steals the item with his hand, and not when it enters his domain by other means.",
            "<b>And if</b> the Torah <b>had taught us</b> only with regard to <b>a thief,</b> one could have said: <b>Because the Merciful One penalized</b> the thief, obligating him to pay double the value of the item, it is clear that the Torah is strict with a thief. Similarly, the Torah also deemed him responsible for an item that was not actually in his hand. <b>But</b> with regard to a <b>bill of divorce, say no,</b> the divorce is not effective unless the husband places the document in her hand. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> in both cases.",
            "§ It was taught in the mishna that if the husband threw the bill of divorce into his wife’s <b>courtyard,</b> she is divorced. The Gemara asks: How can she own a courtyard of her own? There is a principle: <b>That which a woman acquired</b> is <b>acquired</b> by <b>her husband,</b> which indicates that the husband has the rights to all profits generated by his wife’s property. Therefore, for all intents and purposes, the courtyard belongs to him for the duration of their marriage.",
            "<b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> the husband <b>writes to</b> his wife: <b>I have no legal</b> dealings <b>or involvement in your property,</b> thereby relinquishing any ownership rights to her property.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And when he writes this to her, what of it? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who says to another</b> with whom he owns a field in a partnership: <b>I have no rights and claims to this field, or: I have no involvement with it, or: My hand is removed from it;</b> it is as though <b>he said nothing,</b> since these expressions are not considered to be a withdrawal of his rights to the field.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>They say in the school of Rabbi Yannai:</b> The case is one <b>where he writes to her and she is still</b> only <b>betrothed;</b> he has yet to obtain ownership of her property, being that his rights to his wife’s property are only actuated at the time of the marriage. <b>And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rav Kahana, as Rav Kahana says:</b> With regard to <b>an inheritance that comes to a person from another place,</b> i.e., it is not an inheritance from his father, <b>a person can stipulate about it</b> from the outset <b>that he should not inherit it,</b> and this condition is effective in annulling his rights to the inheritance. This teaches that as long as the property has not yet entered his possession, he can withdraw his rights to it.",
            "<b>And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rava, as Rava says: One who says:</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>I do not want</b> to avail myself of <b>the ordinance of the Sages</b> that was instituted on my behalf, <b>such as</b> in <b>this</b> scenario, <b>we listen to him.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is referred to by the words: <b>Such as</b> in <b>this</b> scenario? What case did Rava refer to that he indicated that in similar situations the <i>halakha</i> is the same? The Gemara explains that Rava was referring to <b>that which Rav Huna</b> says that <b>Rav says. As Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says: A woman can say to her husband: I do not</b> wish to <b>be sustained</b> by you, <b>and I will not do</b> work for you. Although the Sages instituted on her behalf that she would be sustained in exchange for her work, she has the choice of waiving that right if she prefers to retain her earnings. Rava adds that in any similar case where the Sages instituted an ordinance for one’s benefit, he can say that he does not wish to accept this rabbinic ordinance if it does not assist him.",
            "<b>Rava said</b> that one can resolve the question about the wife’s ability to acquire a bill of divorce in a courtyard in a more direct way: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>her hand is not acquired by her husband?</b> Yet despite the fact that he owns her hand, she is divorced once she receives a bill of divorce in her hand. <b>Rather,</b> one must say that <b>her bill of divorce and her hand,</b> i.e., her complete ownership over her hand, <b>enter</b> her possession <b>simultaneously.</b> Since the bill of divorce releases her from her obligations to her husband, at that moment she acquires full rights to her hand. <b>Here too,</b> in the case of her courtyard, one can say that <b>her bill of divorce and her courtyard enter</b> her possession <b>simultaneously,</b> as her husband’s rights to her property are terminated at the time of divorce.",
            "<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Was</b> it <b>difficult for Rava</b> to understand the <i>halakha</i> that one can effect divorce by placing a bill of divorce in <b>the hand of a woman?</b> Why is this difficult? <b>Though</b> the rights <b>to her earnings belong to</b> the husband, <b>does her hand itself belong to him?</b> Therefore, since a woman owns her hand, she is divorced once she receives the bill of divorce in her hand; and it is not necessary to apply the principle that the bill of divorce and her hand enter her possession simultaneously. Therefore, there is no proof that the bill of divorce and her courtyard enter her possession simultaneously.",
            "Rav Ashi <b>said to him:</b> It was <b>difficult for Rava</b> to understand the <i>halakha</i> that one can effect emancipation by placing a bill of manumission in <b>the hand of a slave,</b> as follows: <b>According to the one who says</b> that a slave can be emancipated <b>with a bill</b> of manumission <b>by</b> receiving the bill <b>himself,</b> one can ask: How is this effective? Isn’t <b>the hand of a slave like the hand of his master,</b> as the master owns the slave’s body? Therefore, when the master gives the bill of manumission to his slave, it is as though he gave it to himself, and the bill is never considered as having reached the slave’s domain. How can the slave be emancipated in this manner? <b>Rather,</b> one must say that <b>his bill</b> of manumission <b>and his hand enter</b> his possession <b>simultaneously. So too,</b> with regard to a woman’s courtyard, one can explain that <b>her bill of divorce and her courtyard enter</b> her possession <b>simultaneously.</b>",
            "§ The Gemara relates that there was <b>a certain person on his deathbed who wrote a bill of divorce for his wife toward the evening of the coming of the Shabbat, but he did not manage to give it to her. The next day his condition intensified</b> and he was unable to give her the bill of divorce. People <b>came before Rava</b> to ask what they should do. <b>He said to them: Go tell him to transfer to her</b> ownership <b>of that place where the bill of divorce is resting, and she should go and close</b> the door <b>and open</b> it <b>and assert ownership over it,</b> thereby acquiring the place together with the bill of divorce that is in it.",
            "<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Batra</i> 42a): If <b>one locked, fenced</b> in, or <b>breached any amount, this is</b> a valid act of <b>taking possession</b> through which land is acquired.",
            "<b>Rav Ilish said to Rava:</b> How will it help for her to acquire the place, since <b>that which a woman acquired</b> is <b>acquired</b> by <b>her husband?</b> Rava <b>was embarrassed</b> that he issued an incorrect ruling.",
            "<b>Ultimately, it was revealed that she was a betrothed woman. Rava said:</b> I ruled correctly, as even <b>if they said with regard to a married woman</b> that everything she acquires belongs to her husband, would <b>they say</b> the same <b>with regard to a betrothed woman?</b> A betrothed woman’s hand is not considered to be like the hand of her husband. <b>Rava then said:</b> There <b>is no difference</b> if she is <b>a betrothed woman, and there is no difference</b> if she is <b>a married woman,</b> as <b>her bill of divorce and her courtyard enter</b> her possession <b>simultaneously.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> didn’t <b>Rava</b> already <b>say this</b> <i>halakha</i>, that her bill of divorce and her courtyard enter her possession simultaneously, <b>at the outset?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>When Rava said this</b> <i>halakha</i>, <b>he said it in connection with this</b> very <b>incident.</b>",
            "§ It was taught in the mishna that if a husband throws his wife a bill of divorce <b>and she is in her house,</b> then she is divorced. <b>Ulla says: This is</b> only if <b>she is standing next to her house and next to her courtyard,</b> as only then will her house and courtyard acquire it for her. <b>Rabbi Oshaya says: Even</b> if <b>she</b> is <b>in Tiberius and her courtyard</b> is <b>in Tzippori,</b> or if <b>she</b> is <b>in Tzippori and her courtyard</b> is <b>in Tiberius, she is divorced.</b>",
            "The Gemara challenges this: <b>But isn’t</b> it <b>taught</b> in the mishna that <b>she is in her house and in her courtyard?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>This is what</b> the mishna <b>is saying: And she is</b> considered to be <b>like one who is in her house; and she is</b> considered to be <b>like one who is in her courtyard.</b> This means that <b>since it is a courtyard that is secured with her knowledge,</b> it is as though she is there, and <b>she is divorced.</b>",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that they disagree about this</b> issue: One <b>Sage,</b> Ulla, <b>holds</b> that a <b>courtyard is included</b> in the areas where she can obtain ownership of a bill of divorce <b>as</b> an extension of <b>her hand.</b> Consequently, it has the same <i>halakhot</i> as her hand, so that just as her hand is close to her, so too, her courtyard must be close to her in order for her to acquire the bill of divorce through it. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Oshaya, <b>holds</b> that a <b>courtyard is included</b> in the areas where she can obtain ownership of a bill of divorce <b>as</b> an extension of <b>agency,</b> and therefore, like an agent, her courtyard can acquire the bill of divorce for her when she is far away.",
            "The Gemara rejects this: <b>No, everyone</b> agrees that a <b>courtyard is included</b> in the areas where she can obtain ownership of a bill of divorce <b>as</b> an extension of <b>her hand.</b> They disagree about how it is compared to her hand. One <b>Sage,</b> Ulla, <b>holds</b> that it is entirely <b>like her hand. Just as her</b> actual <b>hand is next to</b> her, <b>so too, her courtyard,</b> which is an extension of her hand, acquires the bill of divorce <b>when</b> it is <b>next to</b> her.",
            "<b>And the other</b> Sage, Rabbi Oshaya, holds that <b>if</b> you derive matters in this way, you should say that <b>just as her</b> actual <b>hand is attached</b> to her, <b>so too, her courtyard</b> can acquire a bill of divorce only <b>when</b> it is <b>attached</b> to her, which cannot be. <b>Rather,</b> the comparison is as follows: Her courtyard is <b>like her</b> actual <b>hand,</b> and <b>just as her hand is secured with her knowledge, so too,</b> only <b>her courtyard that is consciously secured by her</b> can acquire a bill of divorce for her. This serves <b>to exclude her courtyard that is not consciously secured by her,</b> i.e., that she has no control over, which cannot acquire a bill of divorce for her, since it is not similar to her hand.",
            "§ The Gemara relates that there was <b>a certain man who threw a bill of divorce to his wife</b> while <b>she was standing in a courtyard. The bill of divorce went</b> and <b>fell onto a board</b> of wood. <b>Rav Yosef said: We see</b> the precise circumstance: <b>If the</b> board encompassed an area of <b>four cubits by four cubits, it</b> thereby is considered to be <b>a separate domain of its own</b> and is not included in the courtyard within which she was standing, and she is consequently not divorced. <b>And if</b> the board was <b>not</b> that large, <b>it is</b> part of the courtyard and it is all <b>one domain,</b> and she is therefore divorced.",
            "The Gemara clarifies: <b>With what are we dealing</b> here? <b>If we say</b> that the incident occurred <b>in her courtyard, if</b> the board <b>had</b> an area of <b>four cubits, what of it?</b> Since the board belongs to her as well, it should still be an effective divorce. <b>Rather,</b> say that the incident occurred <b>in his courtyard;</b> but then, even <b>if</b> the board did <b>not have</b> an area of <b>four cubits, what of it?</b> Since none of it belongs to her, why would it be an effective divorce?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where he lent her</b> the <b>place,</b> i.e., the courtyard, as a means to acquire the bill of divorce. And <b>since people lend one place,</b> but <b>people do not lend two places,</b> if the board is considered to be a separate domain then it was not included in the courtyard that was lent to her, and it would therefore not be an effective divorce.",
            "The Gemara notes: <b>And we said</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in a case where the place onto which the bill of divorce fell <b>was not ten</b> handbreadths <b>higher</b> than the courtyard. <b>But</b> if the place onto which the bill of divorce fell was <b>ten</b> handbreadths <b>higher, even though</b> the board did <b>not have</b> an area of <b>four cubits,</b> it is still considered to be a separate domain.",

            "<b>And Rava says</b> that if one says to his wife: <b>Take your bill of divorce from</b> where it is placed <b>on the ground,</b> it is as though <b>he didn’t say anything</b> and it is not a valid bill of divorce, since a woman is divorced only when the bill of divorce is given to her by her husband. The Gemara answers: <b>Say that</b> the bill of divorce was not placed on the ground behind him, but rather <b>she pulled it out from behind him.</b> In other words, the bill of divorce was tucked into his belt and she pulled it out. Consequently, she received the bill of divorce from him.",
            "The Gemara challenges this: If <b>she pulled it out,</b> it is <b>also</b> not a valid bill of divorce, since it is <b>required</b> that the directive: <b>“And gives it in her hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), be fulfilled, <b>and</b> in this case <b>it is not</b> fulfilled, since he did not give it to her; rather, she took it.

            "<b>Rava says:</b> If <b>he wrote a bill of divorce for her, and he placed it in the hand of her slave</b> when <b>he is sleeping and she is guarding him, it is</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce.</b> Within the context of the <i>halakhot</i> of divorce, a slave has the same status as land, in the sense that both belong to their owner. Therefore, when the husband places the bill of divorce in the slave’s hand, it is as though he placed it into her courtyard. If her slave <b>was awake, it is not</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce</b> because <b>he is</b> like <b>a courtyard that is not consciously secured by her.</b> Since he guards himself, he therefore does not acquire it on her behalf.",
            "Rava continues: If <b>he is sleeping and she is guarding him, it is</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce.</b> The Gemara asks: But <b>why;</b> isn’t it true that the slave <b>is</b> like <b>a mobile courtyard, and a mobile courtyard does not acquire</b> items on behalf of its owner?",

The Gemara concludes: <b>And</b> this <b><i>halakha</i></b> that Rava said, indicating that it is a valid bill of divorce, applies only <b>where</b> the slave is <b>bound</b> and sleeping, since in that case placing the bill of divorce in his hand is like placing it in her hand.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If the woman <b>was standing in the public domain</b> and her husband took the bill of divorce <b>and threw it to her,</b> if it fell <b>closer to her, she is divorced,</b> and if it fell <b>closer to him, she is not divorced.</b> If it is <b>equally balanced,</b> there is uncertainty as to whether <b>she is divorced or</b> whether <b>she is not divorced.

This matter</b> about which they disagree <b>applies</b> only <b>with regard to Shabbat. But here,</b> in the case of divorce, <b>it is because</b> the bill of divorce <b>is secured</b> that she is divorced; <b>and</b> once the bill of divorce is within the airspace of the partitions, <b>it is secured</b> and the Rabbis agree that she is divorced.",
            "<b>And</b> the second matter is <b>that which Rav Ḥisda says</b> concerning the <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat: In the case of one who <b>embedded a reed in</b> the ground of <b>a private domain, and on its top was a basket [<i>teraskal</i>], and he threw</b> an object from the public domain and <b>it rested on top of it, even</b> if the reed was <b>a hundred cubits high, he is liable because the private domain extends upward until the sky.</b> Therefore, the object landed in a private domain. <b>This matter applies</b> only <b>with regard to Shabbat,</b> as with regard to Shabbat domains are defined based on their partitions and the way in which they are used, which differs from the way domains are defined in other halakhic areas. <b>But here,</b> in the case of divorce, <b>it is because</b> the bill of divorce <b>is secured</b> that she is divorced, <b>and</b> when it is on the reed <b>it is not secured.</b>"

Similarly, despite the fact that the roofs are not totally separated from one another and nobody lives there, each roof is considered to be its own domain.",
            "Rava explains: <b>This matter applies</b> only <b>with regard to Shabbat. But with regard to a bill of divorce,</b> if it fell onto another roof that is adjacent to the roof that he lent her for the purpose of acquiring the bill of divorce, she is divorced. The reason that a woman is usually not divorced when a bill of divorce falls into a different place, even though that place also belongs to her husband, is <b>due to</b> the fact that a husband <b>is particular</b> and does not want to lend her more than one place; <b>but people are not particular to that extent,</b> i.e., in this case the husband would not be particular about allowing her to temporarily use an adjacent rooftop that also belongs to him.",
