            "MISHNAH. WHO IS DEEMED TO BE A BASTARD?  [THE OFFSPRING OF A UNION WITH] ANY CONSANGUINEOUS RELATIVE WITH WHOM COHABITATION IS FORBIDDEN;  THIS IS THE RULING OF R. AKIBA. SIMEON THE TEMANITE SAID: [THE OFFSPRING OF ANY UNION] THE PENALTY FOR WHICH IS KARETH AT THE HANDS OF HEAVEN; AND THE HALACHAH IS IN AGREEMENT WITH HIS VIEW, AND R. JOSHUA SAID: [THE OFFSPRING OF ANY UNION]. THE PENALTY FOR WHICH IS DEATH AT THE HANDS OF BETH DIN.  GEMARA. What is R. Akiba's reason? — Because it is written A man shall not take his father's wife and shall not uncover his father's skirt,  he shall not uncover the skirt which his father saw; and he  holds the same opinion as R. Judah who said that this Scriptural text  speaks of a woman whom his father had outraged,  and who is classed among those forbidden to him under the penalty for a negative precept;  and since close to this [text occurs the commandment], A bastard shall not enter the assembly of the Lord,  it is obvious that the offspring of any such union  is deemed to be a bastard. According to R. Simai also who includes  [the offspring of] any other union that is forbidden by a negative precept even though [the offenders are] not consanguineous relatives,  and according to R. Yeshebab who includes  even the offspring of a union forbidden under a positive commandment,  the deduction  is made from And … not. \n"
